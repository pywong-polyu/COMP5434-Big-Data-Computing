Developing new anti-TB compounds using cost-effective processes is critical to reduce TB incidence and accomplish the End TB Strategy milestone. Herein, we describe the synthesis and structure-activity relationships of a library of thirty 7H-Pyrrolo [2,3-d]pyrimidine derivatives providing insights into the contributions of different aromatic, aryl and alkyl substitution at the C-4 position of the 7-deazapurine ring. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the compounds against the green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter strain of Mycobacterium tuberculosis was assayed using the standard broth microdilution method, and cell toxicity was determined using the MTT assay. Sixteen compounds displayed in vitro activity against the GFP reporter strain of Mycobacterium tuberculosis with MIC 90 values of 0.488-62.5 \u00b5M. This study highlights the most potent derivative, N-(4-phenoxy phenyl)- 7H-pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidin-4-amine with a MIC 90 value of 0.488 \u00b5M and was non-cytotoxic to the Vero cell line. Moreover, all the potent compounds from this series have a ClogP value less than 4 and molecular weight < 400; thus, likely to maintain drug-likeness during lead optimisation.",

While the annual number of TB deaths is reducing globally, the progress has been very slow, with a cumulative drop of 14% between 2015 and 2019, which was less than half of the target of a 35% reduction between 2015 and 2020 [2] . The Covid-19 pandemic is a major concern since it has halted years of progress in providing vital TB services aimed at reducing TB burden; this has resulted in an upsurge in TB mortality. The best predictions for TB-related deaths in 2020 are: 1.3 million fatalities among HIV-negative people (up from 1.2 million in 2019) and an additional 214,000 fatalities among HIV-positive people (up from 209,000 in 2019) [3] . As a result, global TB targets are generally off-track. Thus, it is unlikely that TB will be eradicated as a global public health hazard by 2035, as the End TB Strategy anticipates [4] .",

In 2019, about 3.3% of new TB cases and 17.7% of previously treated cases were MDR/RR-TB [2] .

Mtb has a cell envelope that is permeable to nucleosides. The uptake of many antibiotics is hampered by this envelope. The discovery of several nucleoside analogues with antitubercular action suggests that these agents are easily transported into Mtb [6, 7] . Since 7-deazupurine is a purine (nucleosides) analogue ( Fig. 1) , [8, 9] , it might be transported across the envelope through the same transport mechanism utilised by native purines. It is likely that compounds differing in their mechanism of action from existing drugs and, as a result, active against multidrug-resistant tuberculosis strains, can be found among the 7H-pyrrolo[2, 3-d] pyrimidine-based compounds. Thus, in our continuous effort to develop new anti-tubercular agents, we have focused our attention on the synthesis of 7H-pyrrolo[2, 3- ",

            "text": "7H-Pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidine (7-deazapurine), analogous to purine, is one of the interesting classes of N-heterocycles that has been classified as a privileged medicinal scaffold with diverse biological activities [10, 11] . The pyrimidine ring is the building block of DNA and RNA, thus, one possible reason for the wide biological activities of pyrimidinecontaining molecules [12] [13] [14] . Pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidine nucleus is often encountered in some approved drugs, clinical candidates, and functional material. Drugs currently in the market that possess pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidine skeleton include anti-cancer drugs such as ruxolitinib, tofacitinib, and baricitinib [10] . Compounds with pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidine moiety have broad biological applications such as antibacterial, antifungal [15, 16] , adenosine A 1 and A 3 receptor modulator [17] , protein-kinase B inhibitor [18] , anti-inflammatory [19] , anti-cancer [20, 21] , anti-folate [22] , antiviral [23, 24] , and anti-mycobacterial activities [25] [26] [27] . Additionally, some naturally occurring antibiotics such as tubercidin, toyocamycin, sangivamycin ( Fig. 1 ) have pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidine moiety and exhibited significant activity against Mtb, Candida albicans and Cryptococcus neoformans [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] . In recent years, among the 7H-pyrrolo[2, 3-d] pyrimidine derivatives, the search for synthesized compounds possessing anti-tubercular activity ( Fig. 1 ) has been less explored with only a few reports [32, 33] . More specifically, a previous report identified 7-deaza purine analogs (QTT 777 and QTT 405) (Fig. 1 ) modified in the five-membered ring to displayed excellent anti-tubercular activity against the H37Rv strain of Mtb in vitro, with MIC values between 0.08 and 0.35 \u00b5M. These values are comparable or better than the reference drug (Rifampicin 0.09 \u00b5M) [33] . Thus, 7H-pyrrolo[2, 3-d] pyrimidine nucleus can be exploited further in search of affordable new agents for the treatment of TB.",

Target compounds were obtained in 16-94% yields. In general, in the 1 H NMR spectra, the broad singlet signals appearing at ca 11.47 ppm of all the compounds are attributed to the presence of -NH-moiety in the pyrrolyl ring. The singlet appearing in the range 8.63-8.67 ppm is attributed to H-2, and the doublet or doublet of doublets peak in the range of \u03b4 7.31-6.51 ppm are assigned to H-6 or H-5. The change from doublet of doublets to a doublet of H-5 and H-6 is attributed to the replacement of hydrogen at N-7 by deuterium. The assignments for H-5 and H-6 are consistent with the literature review [35] . The NMR spectra are consistent with those reported in the literature [34] . The broad singlet signal or triplet at 9.84-7.84 ppm corresponds to -NH-at position C-4 (for Ar-NH and -NHCH 2 , respectively), and this suggests the successful nucleophilic substitution of the Cl atom in 4-chloro-7H-pyrrolo[2, 3-d] pyrimidine. In the 13 C NMR spectra, resonances for all the carbons are observed. Typically, the signal appearing at ca 55-56 ppm of all the compounds is indicative of the methylene carbon next to 7H-pyrrolo[2, 3-d] pyrimidine nitrogen. The exact mass for all target compounds is confirmed using high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS).",

This suggests that meta and ortho-substituted phenyl The introduction of different halogen atoms on the phenyl ring caused different effects on the antitubercular activity against the GFP reporter strain of Mtb. The presence of a bromine atom seems to generally favour antitubercular activity over other halogens such as chlorine and fluorine. Replacing the chlorine atom in compound 6 (MIC 90: 31.25 \u00b5M) with a bromine atom to afford compound 9 (MIC 90: 15.625 \u00b5M) led to a twofold increase in antitubercular activity. This trend is also observed when comparing compound 8 (MIC 90: 125 \u00b5M) bearing para chlorine against its para bromine analogue, compound 10 (MIC 90: 3.9 \u00b5M), with the bromine bearing analogue still showing superior antitubercular activity. Moreover, compound 2 (MIC 90: 125 \u00b5M), the fluorine analogue of compound 10 is also inactive.

This might be due to the lower electron density of the fluorosubstituted phenyl ring caused by the electron-withdrawing effect of fluorine, which may reduce the binding affinity between the compound and the target, thus decreasing its antitubercular activity. The effect of the fluorine atom is further tested by comparing compound 5 (MIC 90: 125 \u00b5M) against its defluoronated analogue, compound 6 (MIC 90: 31.25 \u00b5M).

In general, antitubercular activity seems to vary with the methylene chain length between the phenyl ring and the secondary amine at C-4 of 7-deazupurine. The results ( .713 \u00b5M) increases as the methylene spacers increase from 2 to 4, demonstrating that flexibility of C-4 substituents is important for antitubercular activity. Besides the effect of methylene spacers on antitubercular activity, the influence of phenyl substituents in the subseries 16-24 was also investigated. Comparing compound 21 against its congener, compound 24 (MIC 90 : 0.572 \u00b5M), bearing meta chlorophenylethylamine again confirms that meta substituted phenyl moieties enhance antitubercular activity. It is interesting to note that compound 24 (MIC 90 : 0.572 \u00b5M), wherein R is 2-(3-Chlorophenyl)ethyl, displayed excellent activity compared to compound 21 (MIC 90 : 31.25 \u00b5M) wherein R is phenylethyl. This shows that both the methylene spacers and the position of chloro substituents on the aryl moiety are crucial for antitubercular activity (Fig. 3) In addition, considering the effect of substituent with alkyl chains linked to the amino group at position 4 of the core 7-deazupurine), the SAR study revealed that the introduction of the aliphatic chain was detrimental to such activity. Thus, the replacement of the phenyl group at the terminal end of the alkyl chain with hydrophilic groups such as hydroxyl, or substitution by methyl markedly resulted in the loss of activity. This is evident in compound 25, 26, 27, 28 wherein R is N-isopentyl, 2-((2-aminoethyl)amino) ethanol, 3-isopropoxypropyl, 3-morpholinopropyl, respectively, and, all exhibited no significant antitubercular activity (MIC 90 > 125 \u00b5M) as compared to compound 22 ((MIC 90 : 14.452 \u00b5M). These data indicate that the phenyl group at the terminal end of the alkyl chain attached to NH on C-4 of 7-deazapurines is a prerequisite for antitubercular activity. ",

However, this compound does not appear to be toxic against the Vero cell line with no cell viability reduction observed at the highest concentration tested (Fig. 5) . The results suggested that compound 11 possessed little overt cytotoxicity risk against the human cell lines tested.",

The active compounds from this study have a molecular weight of less than 400 Da and calculated lipophilicity (ClogP) of less than 4, which make them ideal compounds for hit to lead optimization. Other drug-like properties including oral bioactivity and solubility were predicted using the SwissADME web tool. The predicted solubility of compounds 11, 23 and 24 ranges from \u22123.95 to \u22125.09; thus, these compounds are predicted to be moderately water-soluble. The flexibility defined as the number of rotatable bonds of all the active compounds are less than 9. Also, the polarity describes as the total polar surface area (tPSA) for the active compounds is less than 140 \u00c5 2 (or a total number of both H-bond donors and acceptors is less than 10). Thus, these compounds are predicted to have good oral bioavailability The predicted drug-likeness properties of all the active compounds identified in this study showed that they do not violate any of the parameters of the Lipinski's rule of five [41] . All the active compounds from this study are predicted to possess good passive human gastrointestinal absorption and blood-brain barrier permeation.",

The most active compound in the series is 11 (MIC 90 = 0.488), which was evaluated for cytotoxicity potentials against Human skin fibroblasts hTERT and Vero cell lines. The compound displays weak cytotoxicity against the BJ-5ta cell line but possesses no potential cytotoxicity risk against Vero cell lines. Also, the SAR study suggested that site substituted on the phenyl ring and methylene spacers between the phenyl and amine moieties at C-4 of 7-deazupurine influence antitubercular activity. All the potent compounds in this series have molecular weights less than 400 Da and ClogP less than 4, which suggests they are likely to maintain drug-likeness during lead optimisation. The results from this study provide evidence that compounds based on 7H-pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidine could be further explored for the discovery of new compounds against TB.",

The progress of the reactions was monitored by thin-layer chromatography (TLC) using Merck 60F 254 silica gel plates (Merck, Johannesburg, South Africa) supported on aluminium, and the plates were visualized under ultraviolet (UV254 and 366 nm) light or stained with iodine vapour. 1 H and 13 C NMR spectra were recorded on Bruker Biospin 600 MHz spectrometer, and the chemical shifts are given in values referenced to deuterated DMSO-d 6 and are reported in parts per million (ppm). Chemical shifts for deuterated DMSO-d 6 appear at 2.5 ppm for 1 H and 39.5 ppm for 13 C NMR spectra. Proton coupling patterns are abbreviated as follows: s (singlet), d (doublet), dd (doublet of doublet), t (triplet), q (quartet), and m (multiplet). Coupling constants (J) are reported in Hz. NMR data were analysed using MestReNova Software, version 5.3.2-4936. Melting points (mp) were established with a B\u00fcchi melting point B-545 instrument and were uncorrected. The High-resolution mass spectra (HRMS) were recorded using a Bruker micrOTOF-Q II mass spectrometer using atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI) in positive ion mode.
