Definitive diagnosis of acute myocarditis was made by endomyocardial biopsy in Case 1 (Figure 1 ), whereas Cases 2 and 3 had a combination of clinical manifestations and typical cardiac magnetic resonance imaging abnormalities used for diagnosis of myocarditis ( Figure 2 ). 5 We used clinical diagnostic criteria from the 2013 European Society of Cardiology for Case 4: new-onset acute chest pain with diffuse ST elevation and high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T. 5 Patients were initially treated with oral colchicine and ibuprofen. Because of a lack of clinical improvement, a LGE abnormality 0 \u00fe \u00fe 0 decision was made to give high-dose intravenous methylprednisolone for 3 to 8 days. Cardiac markers improved significantly after corticosteroid initiation (Supplemental Figures 1  and 2) . On clinic follow-up at 4 to 6 weeks, patients' clinical status was stable, and they had normal high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T levels.

Myocarditis/pericarditis following the second dose was found more often than after the first dose (2.8 vs. 16.1 cases per million doses). Interestingly, among the two mRNA vaccines available in the US, the BNT162b2 vaccine has a lower rate of myocarditis/pericarditis than the mRNA-1273 vaccine (10.4 vs. 24.7 cases per million of the second doses). 7 Two recent published case series reported successful conservative therapies in most patients. 8, 9 However, our patients symptomatically improved with systemic corticosteroids, which is similar to a case from Verma et al. 10 An endomyocardial biopsy performed in Case 1 revealed lymphocyticeosinophilic injury-mediated myocarditis, which is similar to myocarditis related to smallpox vaccination. 11, 12 Moreover, Verma et al recently reported pathological findings with fulminant myocarditis after mRNA-1273 vaccinations that showed inflammatory infiltrate admixed with macrophages, T cells, eosinophils, and B cells. 10 These findings suggest that the primary mechanism of myocardial injury may be LGE is seen in the mid wall region in a multifocal distribution in all views (arrows and arrowheads).

The medical community continues to advocate for universal COVID-19 vaccination in society. Overall, further research and monitoring for adverse events will lead to best treatment practices related to COVID-19 vaccination. ",
