In the present study, we aimed to investigate the therapeutic potential of novel galectin-3 inhibitors by treating thyroid cancer cells with different concentrations of GB1107 or TD139. At high doses, TD139, but not GB1107, reduced cell viability and clonogenicity of thyroid cancer cells. TD139 induced apoptosis of thyroid cancer cells, as evident by an increase in the percentage of sub-G1 cells on cell cycle analysis, caspase-3 activation, and PARP1 cleavage. Either GB1107 or TD139 significantly inhibited cell coherence and counteracted anoikis resistance. Both inhibitors decreased migratory and invasive abilities in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, GB1107 and TD139 treatment attenuated AKT phosphorylation and decreased the expression of \u03b2-catenin and MMP2. In conclusion, these novel galectin-3 inhibitors suppressed the anoikis resistance, motility, and invasive capacity of thyroid cancer cells at least partly through the AKT/\u03b2-catenin pathway. Galectin-3 inhibitors are potentially suitable for preclinical evaluation of treatment and/or prevention of metastatic spread in thyroid cancer.",

Other than clinical assessment, thyroid ultrasonography and fine-needle aspiration biopsy are the primary tools used for initial cancer risk stratification. Nonetheless, about 20% to 25% of cytological evaluation would be reported as indeterminate. A few molecular testing modalities have been developed to minimize unnecessary diagnostic thyroid surgery for indeterminate thyroid nodules [2] . ere has been considerable interest in the identification of cancer-specific markers by gene expression profiles or immunocytochemistry. Among various biomarkers, galectin-3 and dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP4) were found to be upregulated and consistently coexpressed in differentiated thyroid cancer [3] . Recently, we reported that DPP4 is not only a diagnostic and prognostic marker but also a potential therapeutic target in papillary thyroid cancer [4] .",

As shown in Figure 2 , GB1107 and TD139 did not change the expression of galectin-3 in thyroid cancer cells. e expression of cyclin D1 was attenuated by treatment with a high dose (100 \u03bcM) of TD139, consistent with a decrease in the percentage of S-phase cells on cell cycle analysis. Of note, TD139 at 100 \u03bcM significantly increased the cleaved active caspase-3. During the process of apoptosis, caspases-3 activation results in cleavage and inactivation of proteins involved in DNA repair. Among these proteins, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP1) cleavage is a frequently used marker of apoptosis. We observed that remarkable PARP1 cleavage was present at 24 h following treatment with TD139 ( Figure 2 ), in agreement with the sub-G1 population representing apoptotic cells with reduced DNA content (Figure 1(b) ). Taken together, these results indicate that TD139, but not GB1107, induces apoptosis and reduces cell viability in thyroid cancer cells.",

In the two cell lines we examined, GB1107 treatment decreased ERK phosphorylation, whereas TD139 treatment increased ERK phosphorylation. On the other hand, phosphorylation of p38 MAPK increased following treatment with GB1107, but not TD139. JNK1 phosphorylation tended to decrease following treatment with galectin-3 inhibitors, but the pattern was not consistent between the two cell lines ( Figure 6 ). Overall, these findings suggest that the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways may not be the main effectors of the galectin-3 inhibitors. By contrast, both GB1107 and TD139 attenuated AKT phosphorylation in FTC-133 and 8505C cells. Furthermore, the expression of \u03b2-catenin showed a corresponding decrease following GB1107 or TD139 treatment. Finally, we examined the expression of matrix metalloproteinase MMP2 in thyroid cancer cells. Parallel to the decreased invasive capacity in association with treatment with galectin-3 inhibitors, MMP2 expression progressively diminished when thyroid cancer cells were treated with increasing doses of GB1107 or TD139. Taken together, the AKT/\u03b2-catenin pathway is likely involved in the suppression of anoikis resistance and motility in thyroid cancer cells following treatment with galectin-3 inhibitors.",

Knockdown of galectin-3 decreased cell growth in B-CPAP but not 8305C cells [29] , suggesting cell-dependent disparities. e most consistent finding in this study was the suppressed anoikis resistance and migratory/invasive capacity following galectin-3 inhibition. In line with our International Journal of Endocrinology results, Takenaka et al. reported that galectin-3 transfection into normal thyroid follicular cells potentiated anchorageindependent growth and loss of contact inhibition [30] . Additionally, treatment with low-molecular citrus pectin reduced cell migration in thyroid cancer cells [29] . Distant metastasis, either synchronous or metachronous, has a negative impact on the overall and disease-specific survival of patients with thyroid cancer [31] . In this regard, galectin-3 inhibitor therapy may be incorporated in the treatment or prevention of distant metastasis from thyroid cancer. e phosphorylation level of ERK was shown to be downregulated following galectin-3 silencing or treatment with Td131_1 [22, 29] . However, we observed an inconsistent trend of the change in ERK phosphorylation after GB1107 and TD139 treatment. On the other hand, our data are in concordance with the results of Lin and colleagues [22] and indicate a progressive decline in AKT phosphorylation after treatment with galectin-3 inhibitors. An immunohistochemical study suggested a strong correlation between galectin-3 and \u03b2-catenin expression in benign and malignant thyroid tissues [32] . Consistently, we found that \u03b2-catenin expression was decreased in parallel to the attenuation of AKT phosphorylation. In hepatocellular carcinoma, galectin-3 overexpression enhanced metastasis through the PI3K/AKT/GSK-3\u03b2/\u03b2-catenin signaling cascade [33] . Our findings are further supported by a study demonstrating that \u03b2-catenin activation was highly dependent on the PI3K/AKT activity but not on the MAPK [34] .",

MMP2 is significantly overexpressed among matrix metalloproteinases in thyroid cancer and was associated with lymph node metastasis [35] . Matrix metalloproteinases contribute to the degradation of the extracellular matrix and facilitate cancer invasion. Moreover, MMP2 plays an important role in the angiogenic switch [36] . Of interest, a strong relationship between the galectin-3 network and the CD74 network was identified in a reverse-phase protein analysis [37] . We previously showed that treatment with anti-CD74 antibody inhibited cell invasion and vascular endothelial growth factor secretion in thyroid cancer cells [38] . A positive correlation between galectin-3 and CD74 expression was noted in thyroid cancer (unpublished observation). e interaction between galectin-3 and CD74 deserves further investigation in detailed molecular studies.",
