In Iran, the first report on COVID-19 was on December 21, 2019. Nearly 6.04 million people in Iran have been infected with the virus, and 128.272 people have died by the end of November 2021 (https://www.worldometers. info/coronavirus/). Lockdowns in some countries have led to logistical problems in the seafood trade due to shipping and border restrictions.

Shrimp farming was initially started by native species such as Penaeus semisulcatus and P. indicus. Still, due to the prevalence of white spot syndrome viral disease (WSSV) and the damage caused by the outbreak of this disease in 2004, the Iranian Fisheries Science Research Institute (IFSRI), with the aim at species diversity and combating WSSV, introduced a non-native species named Litopenaeus vannamei to the Iran shrimp industry [18] . Now, the shrimp farming industry with an area of 11,000 ha is located on the southern and northern coasts of the country, including Khuzestan, Bushehr, Hormozgan, Golestan, and Sistan and Baluchestan provinces. Because of the country's climatic conditions, the shrimp farming period, except for farms located in Hormozgan province, is once a year, which usually lasts from May to November. Today, up to 90% of the shrimp produced is exported through ports to China, Europe, and the Arab countries of the Persian Gulf. Because of the imposition of international sanctions against Iran in recent years, the farming industry is considered one of the most profitable industries. According to statistics provided by the Fisheries Organization of Iran in 2019, this industry can be profitable amounted to $220 million by producing 47,000 tons of shrimp [11] .",

In all three series, some common questions were asked to obtain participants' comments about COVID-19 impacts on different production processes. The questionnaire was prepared using the online Google platform [1] . The survey was open to all shrimp aquaculture activists who had access to digital operating systems and social applications. The shrimp aquaculture activists who work in Iran's shrimp industry were introduced by the Iranian Fisheries Organization and related unions. On April 12, 2020, the link to the questions was sent to shrimp aquaculture activists in Iran through WhatsApp groups and other social networks. Within a week, 568 industry activists representing farmers, material suppliers, and feed producers (68.38%), hatchery centers (21.48%), and processors (10.14%) worldwide responded to questions. Phone calls were made to verify the information collected through the online survey. The data were statistically analyzed based on the ranking.

In recent years, due to international sanctions, fluctuations in the dollar price, and the devaluation of the national currency, there have been no imports of broodstocks of shrimp into the country. The last shipment of SPF (Specific Pathogen Free) broodstocks of L. vannamei to the country was from Molokaei Broodstock Company (MBC) in 2016 [19] . During this period, shrimp industry activists (private sector) cooperated with organizations such as the Iranian Veterinary Organization, IFSRI, and the Iran Fisheries Organization domesticated farmed shrimp-produced broodstocks of L.vannamei in the country. Therefore, during the outbreak of COVID-19 in the country, the hatchery centers did not have any problems supplying SPF broodstocks of L. vannamei [14] . Thus, each commercial shrimp hatchery center provided their required broodstocks by developing selective breeding programs. Therefore, broodstocks transfers between centers were rare, except on a few occasions. However, the problems related to their supply and transfer had the lowest percentage of problems (26.7%). While, in India and many other countries, SPF broodstock imports from the United States, Madagascar, and Mexico have been hampered by border closures [15] .",

During this period, Iranian technicians started producing larvae based on work experience. Nevertheless, the larval production of breeding centers was severely reduced.

Usually, lack of a valid certificate and IVO obstruction on importing these goods into the country leads to illegal import through the UAE. Coinciding the COVID-19 disease with Thai airways closure and the non-issuance of licenses to cargo, in addition to higher transportation costs, led to the import of these materials and equipment with a three-month delay from the beginning of the breeding season. Thus, restrictions in the supply of equipment and materials for reproduction were observed mainly due to problems related to the transfer of larval food and equipment (including micro nets, water diagnostic kits, and more) into the country (90% and 78.65%, respectively). Since culturing period in most shrimp farming areas of Iran is once a year, delay in larval production due to problems caused by the outbreak of coronavirus disease disrupted larval supply and demand at the beginning of rearing season in Iran. One of the industry's main problems was the fluctuations of the dollar price and the devaluation of the national currency and international sanctions, which in addition to imposing high costs on the industry, disrupted the transfer of money and goods internationally [3, 10] .",

Sometimes the managers of hatchery centers had to pay more for the supply of these materials than last year, which led to an increase in the cost of selling larval shrimp. Other problems in the larval production sector include the increased cost of performing diagnostic tests by veterinary diagnostic laboratories. It is noteworthy that due to the dependence of these laboratories on imported diagnostic kits, the increase in the cost of the dollar, international sanctions, and finally the closure of air borders, in addition to disrupting the supply of these kits, the cost of diagnostic tests was significantly increased (80%) ( Table 1) .",

About 27% of farmers prepared their ponds for secondary stocking did not work due to larval supply problems, lack of feed and other necessities, and unpredictable market conditions. Also, shrimp farming was disrupted due to a deficiency of post larvae early in the rearing period and increased demand. Therefore, the most critical problems in the farms included problems related to the supply of post larvae, equipment (Electric water pump, aerator, etc.) and materials, labor, shrimp sales, road and quarantine restrictions, acceptance of shrimp in processing and production costs. The results showed that due to the prevalence of COVID-19 disease and other problems of hatchery centers, larval production was severely reduced, so the supply of post larvae compared to items such as shrimp feed, equipment, and materials needed the highest amount (Fig. 1) . Thus, 50.94% and 61.18% of shrimp farmers agreed on increasing the cost of post larvae and production, respectively.",

Non-observance of the social distance between labor forces working in farms and sometimes movement of asymptomatic people between farms with no protective equipment such as masking caused an increase in the spread of the disease among workers, resulting in a disturbance in shrimp farming. However, 60.15% of farmers had difficulty hiring rearing workers, while 43.53% and 61.22% had difficulty hiring skilled expert and shrimp harvester workers, respectively. The shrimp feed industry is heavily dependent on-farm operations, so poor post larval stocking in-farm has led to the reduction or closure of farm shrimp feed mills. On the other hand, lockdown affects the transportation of raw materials such as fish meal, soybean meal, and fish oil and hinders the operation of feed mills. Therefore, other problems during the growing season were rising shrimp feed prices and running farm costs. The main reasons for this event could be the closure of borders and the reduction of imports of materials for the disease coincided with the devaluation of the national currency and rising economic shrimp feed factories and other needs due to coronavirus outbreak disease in the world. However, the farmers of view were related to larval transport (38.82%), food transport (45.06%), road restrictions (49.41%), and acceptance of crops in shrimp processing centers (56.47%) due to lack of worker force. The outbreak inflation increased current running costs by 20%, but farmers made significant profits last year due to rising dollar prices ( Table 2) . Kumaran et al. [15] reported that losses caused by the COVID-19 outbreak in India on shrimp production are estimated at more than 40%, worth $ 1.50 billion. If the lockdown and other restrictions continue in the next crop season, the overall economic damage will be much more significant than expected. On the other hand, consumers are now paying more money for aquatic products, but dealers pay less to buy these products from farmers [9] .",

The short-term and long-term effects of COVID-19 marginalize coastal communities that have previously been vulnerable to many social and environmental changes [2] . This year, despite the increase in shrimp production in the country and the increase in production costs, and the devaluation of the national currency, unfortunately, the decline in consumer demand, especially in shrimp-buying countries, has been severely fallen due to the closure of international markets cause of the outbreak of coronavirus disease, travel restrictions in tourist countries around the world and the closure of restaurants. Until December 2020, less than 60% of the harvested shrimp has been exported, and most of the shrimp produced is stored in cold storage. Since December 2020, the harvested shrimps have gradually been sold and exported at lower prices than the same period of last year. However, the lower price was compensated by the decrease in Rials value against the US Dollar. Nevertheless, a little cash was paid to farmers, and farmers did not fully pay their debts to the suppliers. Given that the next rearing season in the country has just started, the industry will face bankruptcy if this situation continues. Last year, with a production of more than 47,000 tons of shrimp, it had a profit of $220,000.
