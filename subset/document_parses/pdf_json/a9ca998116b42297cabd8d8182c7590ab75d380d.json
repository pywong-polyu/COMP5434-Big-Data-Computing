Bilateral ground glass opacities, as well as bilateral multiple lobular and subsegmental areas of consolidation, are described as typical imaging findings [5] . Complications include respiratory failure, non-pulmonary complications such as acute myocardial injury, renal failure or thromboembolic events, septic shock, and multiple organ failure in severe cases.

For these patients, a step-by-step concept of a comprehensive multimodal and interdisciplinary PR is needed, differentiated according to the extent of the impairment caused by the infection, the activity restrictions, and the participation disorders. For most patients, an inpatient setting is necessary due to the complexity and degree of the limitations [10] . However, inpatient PR during the COVID-19 pandemic can only occur under considerable restrictions (significantly reduced number of patients and therapies, personnel-intensive care, high hygienic expenses), especially if isolation is still required. In a previous study, we showed that isolation not only leads to reduction of therapies but also has a negative impact on the outcome of a pulmonary rehabilitation program [11] .",

Finally, restoration of the ability to perform at work and in everyday social life represents the participation-oriented goals. However, little is known regarding to what extent these goals of PR can be achieved in post-COVID-19 patients, particularly in comparison to patients with pulmonary diseases usually referred to PR.

In this cohort, a walking distance of <200 m according to the initial 6-MWT was found in 58 patients. The duration of the higher and lower intensity intervals was set to 30-60 (55-70% of maximum heart rate) and 60 s, respectively. The rate of perceived exertion (RPE) measured by the adapted Borg Scale (1-10) was used to define and adapt exercise intensity with a goal of Borg 4-6 (dyspnea) during exercise [16] [17] [18] . Since most patients were very weak on PR admission, exercise started at very low intensity and increased continuously according to the patients' tolerance. RPE was assessed after each exercise session. Duration of cycling was titrated individually starting at 5-10 min at entry and increasing over time up to 30-35 min at discharge. Exercise duration was usually increased first, with the goal to reach 20 min. After that, intensity was increased as well. All patients were monitored using pulse oximetry during their exercise. Criteria for stopping or reducing exercise intensity were an oxygen saturation (SpO 2 ) < 88% and dyspnea symptoms (Borg \u2265 6). When a drop in SpO 2 was observed, oxygen was added with a maximum of 6-8 L per minute via nasal cannula to keep the SpO 2 > 90%. More than half of PG patients (n = 58) had an initial 6-MWT distance < 200 m, which required an individual adaptation of training. Partially bedridden patients started with in-bed cycling and MOTO-Med \u00ae (RECK-Technik GmbH & Co. KG Medizintechnik, Reckstra\u00dfe 1-5, D-88422 Betzenweiler, Germany). This was followed by first walking attempts with walking aids until first cycling interval training was possible. For fitter patients (6-MWT distance > 200 m), endurance training was carried out either on the treadmill or cycle ergometer. The speed of treadmill training was calculated based on the result of the 6-MWT (80% of 6-MWT pace; 6-MWT distance \u00d7 0.008 = exercise speed in km/h) but was also symptom-limited (Borg \u2265 6).",

Previously, we showed that patients with acute deteriorations of pulmonary function do benefit from PR [33] . However, little is known about the extent to which post-COVID-19 patients benefit from PR. The limitations in physical capacity according to the results of the initial 6-MWT of post-COVID-19 patients exceed the limitations observed in patients usually participating in PR. Nevertheless, post-COVID-19 patients did benefit to a greater extent from PR than LG. Indeed, our multivariate analysis clearly demonstrated that COVID-19 itself had a strong impact on changes in FT, FIM, and 6-MWT.",

We suspect that the acquired physical and psychological limitations in the PG were predominantly at least partially reversible, which was obviously not the case in the LG.

Compared to Puchner et al., our COVID-19 patients showed significantly higher physical limitations in 6-MWT on PR admission; however, the absolute improvements during PR were identical.

In this context, it is of note that lengths of stay in rehabilitation of COVID-19 patients were comparable to those of normal PR patients, despite persisting limitations. Several aspects can be taken into account for identical PR duration. One reason is the long absence from the home environment. On average, patients were away from home for more than 45 days, which many patients reported to be enormously stressful. In addition, a ban on visits to the clinic had to be imposed due to the pandemic, which meant that communication with relatives was only possible via phone calls.",

These results are in contrast to the findings of Roberts et al. showing that physical function deficits in COVID-19 patients were associated with an increased odds ratio of discharge to an institution from acute care hospitals [7] . In Switzerland, patients with severe COVID-19 infection and persistent significant functional deficits were given the option to be transferred to an inpatient rehabilitation program for post-acute treatment. Fortunately, the costs for inpatient rehabilitation are covered by the Swiss health system. For this reason, PR in the post-acute phase of severe COVID-19 infection represents an important link in the care chain.",

The comparison group used in this study is only conditionally suitable to make an adequate comparison. Due to the retrospective collection of data and the resulting missing data of the control group, direct comparison regarding, e.g., PFT, HADS, CRQ or comorbidities has not been possible. Second, no statement can be made about the impact of specific treatment measures since this study was rather focused on the overall effects of the multidisciplinary treatment plan. Thus, we cannot differentiate the influencing value of specific treatment sessions on the overall outcome of the rehabilitation plan. Finally, this study only provides data for the immediate PR effect; long-term results cannot be derived from this. Long-term monitoring of further PR needs, reporting of quality of life, and long-term benefits of rehabilitation must be provided by future studies.",
