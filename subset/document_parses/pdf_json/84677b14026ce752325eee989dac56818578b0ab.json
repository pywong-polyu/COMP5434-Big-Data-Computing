We assessed the cumulative incidence of acute of CV complications during hospitalisation for CAP in Internal Medicine Units (IMUs). Methods: This was a prospective study carried out in 26 IMUs, enrolling patients consecutively hospitalised for CAP. Defined CV complications were: newly diagnosed heart failure, acute coronary syndrome, new onset of supraventricular or ventricular arrhythmias, new onset hemorrhagic or ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack. Outcome measures were: in-hospital and 30-day mortality, length of hospital stay and rate of 30-day rehospitalisation.",

In-hospital (12.2% vs 4.7%, p < 0.0001) and 30-day (16.3% vs 8.9%, p = 0.0001) mortality was higher in patients with CV events, as well as the rehospitalisation rate (13.3% vs 9.3%, p = 0.002), and mean hospital stay was 11.4 \u00b1 6.9 vs 9.5 \u00b1 5.6 days (p < 0.0001).

The association between CAP and cardiovascular (CV) complications seems to be a frequent event, especially in the elderly population, and recent research has provided insights into the pathogenesis of acute CV events occurring during CAP [3] [4] [5] [6] . Agents causing CAP can induce direct and indirect effects on the CV system. Infections induce a significant inflammatory response with the production and release of several mediators which can determine systemic effects such as activation of coagulation, enhanced platelets aggregation, and myocardial injury [7] . Mediators of the inflammatory response can modify electrophysiological properties of myocardial cells, determining increased vulnerability to cardiac arrhythmias, especially atrial fibrillation (AF) [8] . Moreover S. pneumoniae, the most frequent bacterial agent of CAP, determines cardiotoxicity mainly through the activity of pneumolysin, with direct consequences on myocardial injury [9, 10] . Recently, it has been suggested that CAP patients at risk for early and long-term CV events can be identified by cardiac biomarkers [11] .",

The occurrence of CV events increased significantly the overall risk of 30-day death, need for Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission and prolonged hospital stay compared to patients not experiencing such complications. However, the burden of CV complications in CAP patients admitted to Internal Medicine Units, as well as the knowledge of predictors of such events, is still uncertain. Available studies used different designs (retrospective vs prospective), different criteria to define CV complications and were performed in heterogeneous settings such as ICU, Emergency Departments, Pneumology Units, as well as Internal Medicine and the community. Such a heterogeneity makes it difficult to retrieve reliable data regarding CAP patients hospitalised in Internal Medicine Units, which is the setting where most pneumonia patients are currently admitted.",

Moreover, the occurrence of acute kidney injury according to KDIGO criteria [17] during hospitalisation was an independent risk factor for the CV events. Risk factors for the occurrence of the most relevant CV events (newly diagnosed heart failure, new onset atrial fibrillation or flutter, acute coronary syndrome) during hospitalisation are described in detail in Tables of Supplementary Material.

Specifically, more than half of events occurred within the first 24 h of admission, and 76.8% AF Atrial fibrillation, CAD Coronary artery disease, COPD Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, TIA Transient ischemic attack, CKD Chronic kidney disease occurred within 3 days. These results are in line with previous findings, because in the cohort by Corrales-Medina et al. and in the SIXTUS study, CV events occurred within the first day in 55% of patients and within 2 days in 61% of cases, respectively [12, 13] . In our study, the vast majority of CV events occurred within the first 3 days of hospitalisation for CAP, and special attention should be focused in this time window in order to intercept CV complications. This is particularly true for those patients who appeared at higher risk such as those over the age of 75, with a history of coronary artery disease, arterial hypertension, and more severe pneumonia (PSI > 130, pleural effusion). These observations are not unexpected, as all these elements correlate with a higher CV burden and risk of complications, as supported by biological plausibility and results from other studies [12, 13, 21, 22] . Interestingly, in ICECAP the occurrence of AKI during hospitalisation was an independent risk factor for the occurrence of CV events. We can speculate that AKI occurring in the context of CAP represents two sides of the same coin. On one side the occurrence of AKI can be the expression of a more severe inflammatory burden. In fact, it has been shown that elevated and imbalanced pro-and anti-inflammatory mediators along with severe endothelial dysfunction and ischemia may induce kidney injury [23] . On the other side, acute renal injury per se determines detrimental effects increasing the risk of CV events [17] .",

            "text": "It has been reported that some types of antibiotic treatment can influence the outcome and CV risk in patients hospitalised for pneumonia [24] . In particular, it was suggested that quinolones could increase the risk of arrhythmias [25, 26] , but this was not the case in our experience. Indeed, in our study the treatment with quinolones was found to be inversely related to the occurrence of CV events. In our opinion this result is difficult to interpret for several reasons, the more relevant probably being the use of quinolones in association with other antibiotics, and the influence of fluid and electrolyte balance on the occurrence of CV events. All these factors could have affected the occurrence of CV events independently from quinolone use, and finally, we cannot exclude that this observation depends on chance It is well known that CAP is associated with a relevant risk of mortality during hospital stay and afterwards [27] , and previous findings have suggested that CV complications are associated with poor outcome in community-acquired pneumonia [28, 29] . According to the results of our study, the occurrence of CV events in people admitted for CAP has negative consequences on in-hospital and 30-day outcome. The absolute inhospital and 30-day mortality of patients with CV events were particularly high with respect to those free of events; 12.2% vs 4.7, and 16.3% vs 8.9%, respectively. Remarkably, the occurrence of CV events independently and significantly increased the risk of death at 30 days (HR 1.69, 95% CI 1.14-2.51; p = 0.009) when adjusted for other variables. Only the development of AKI during hospitalisation, dementia, and PSI > 130 points were associated with a substantial risk increase in 30-day mortality. These findings were similar to those reported in the study by Corrales-Medina et al., where the occurrence of a CV event independently increased the probability of 30-day death by a factor of 1.7. These results differ substantially from those reported in the SIXTUS study, where the risk of 30-day mortality attributed to a CV event during hospitalisation increased nearly fivefold.",

A second limitation of the study is the exclusion of antimicrobial treatments from statistical analysis of outcome measures. After several considerations, we decided to avoid the inclusion of such variables in regression models. Gathering information for antimicrobial treatment is complex, as an example a single patient can receive multiple antibiotics at different times during the in-hospital course for different reasons, thus obtaining sound information from spurious data can be difficult and possibly misleading. Similarly, another limitation can be that cardiovascular medications were tested as variables at univariate analysis, but not considered for the multivariable model. The reasons supporting this decision were that cardiovascular drugs were registered on admission and prescribed for conditions prior to the hospitalisation for CAP. At univariate analysis, drugs such as ACE-i/ARBs, Beta-blockers and antiplatelets were frequently associated with an increased risk of CV events during hospitalisation for CAP ( Supplementary Material Tables 1, 2 and 3) . These results seem in contrast with biological plausibility and well-documented scientific evidence proving a protective CV effect of ACE-i/ARBs, Beta-blockers, statins and antiplatelets in many clinical conditions (i.e. surgery, secondary prevention, etc). Indeed, the results of univariate analysis very likely reflect the greater prevalence of CV medications in patients with a history of cardiovascular diseases. In view of these considerations, many potential confounders related to cardiovascular drugs could have induced a bias in the analysis, interpretation and reliability of results, thus we consciously decided not to include cardiovascular medications in the multivariable model.",
