Participants and setting: 1107 Greek adults were sampled from the general population. Methods: Participants completed the Adverse Childhood Experiences Questionnaire, Patient Health Questionnaire, Primary Care PTSD Screen for DSM-5, Pandemic Stressor Scale, and Brief Cope Scale. Results: ACEs and depression were both predominantly associated with difficult housing conditions as a stressor (b = 0.079, p < .001 and b = 0.046, p < .001, respectively), whereas PTSD was mainly related to fear of contracting the COVID-19 virus (b = 0.065, p < .001). Self-blame was the main coping strategy associated with both ACEs (b = 0.046, p = .010), depression (b = 0.071, p < .0005), and PTSD (b = 0.088, p < .0005). Difficult housing conditions and self-blame further demonstrated a significant serial mediation effect in the relationship between ACEs with both depression (b = 0.105, 95% CI [0.0607, 0.158]) and PTSD (b = 0.019, 95% CI [0.011, 0.031]). 2",

            "text": "The COVID-19 pandemic has instigated challenging ramifications, disrupting the everyday lives of individuals worldwide (Giuntella et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2020) . Yet, there is a marked difference in the degree to which individuals are affected by these stressors, with many displaying resilience (Barzilay et al., 2020) , and some demonstrating increased psychological vulnerability (Coulombe et al., 2020) . Enhancing the understanding of the latter group is imperative to help service providers and policy makers with identifying trajectories of recovery. The term 'psychological vulnerability' is herein applied to refer to the susceptibility of developing psychopathological symptoms. Psychological vulnerability in general comprises a complex variety of variables, including genetic predispositions (Cross-Disorder Group of the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium, 2013), biological factors (Labonte & Turecki, 2010) , early environmental conditions (Nelson et al., 2020) , cultural and socioeconomic variations (Dressler et al., 2008) , the presence of external stressors (Banica et al., 2021; Heim & Binder, 2012) , the ways in which individuals cope with stressors (Kalial et al., 2020; Sheffler et al., 2019) , and interactions between such variables (Heim & Binder, 2012) . Hence, in working towards a comprehensive understanding of vulnerable individuals in the COVID-19 era, insights about distinct risk factors, pandemic stressors, coping strategies, and psychological health should be addressed in tandem. The current study addresses the associations between adverse childhood experiences with depression and posttraumatic stress because other studies suggest a relationship between these variables during the COVID-19 pandemic (Kim et al., 2020; Seitz et al., 2021) . However, to the authors' knowledge, no study has explored what aspects of the pandemic and ways of coping with these stressors may explain these associations. Fig. 1 below presents a conceptual roadmap that outlines the pathways to be explored in this study.",

            "text": "One factor that has been demonstrated to predispose individuals for heightened psychological vulnerability during the COVID-19 pandemic is past exposure to adverse and traumatic childhood experiences (Chi et al., 2020; Kim et al., 2020; Seitz et al., 2021; Shreffler et al., 2021; Tsur & Abu-Raiya, 2020) . The World Health Organization defines childhood adversity and trauma as all experiences that involve abuse, neglect, or maltreatment, and that leads to potential or actual harm to children (Butchart et al., 2006) . The definitions of 'adversity' and 'trauma' are subject to controversies in the literature, with some suggesting that 'trauma' describes events on the high-end of adversity (Krupnik, 2019) . This paper applies the term 'adversity' to refer to the experiences themselves, and 'trauma' to reflect the psychological impact of these events (Trickey, 2021) . These terms are therefore herein used in conjunction to capture the potential impact of all such experiences. Childhood adversity is one of the most important risk factors in the aetiology of psychiatric disorders throughout the life span (Felitti et al., 1998; Nelson et al., 2020) , posing a notably increased risk for the onset of internalizing psychopathology, such as depression and anxiety disorders (Li et al., 2016; Lindert et al., 2014; Liu et al., 2012; Maniglio, 2013) . The psychological vulnerability implicated in this factor can be explained through the stress sensitization hypothesis (Hammen et al., 2000) , which suggests that early exposure to adverse and traumatic experiences results in a decreased tolerance for stress (Hammen et al., 2000; Heim et al., 2019) . This notion is supported by evidence demonstrating that childhood adversity and trauma may lead to a dysregulation of biological regulatory systems involved in stress responses that results in a heightened affective and physiological reactivity to stressors (Nusslock & Miller, 2016; Taylor et al., 2011) , with these effects being particularly detrimental in cases of cumulative adverse experiences (Felitti et al., 1998) . In line with this, a recent longitudinal study compared data collected before and during the COVID-19 pandemic and showed that elevated exposure to childhood adversity is related to heightened levels of posttraumatic stress during the pandemic (Seitz et al., 2021) . However, no participant in this study identified the COVID-19 pandemic as the culprit for their posttraumatic stress symptoms, suggesting that exposure to pandemic stressors exacerbated preceding traumarelated symptomatology.",

            "text": "A critical question, then, is what pandemic stressors interact with adverse and traumatic childhood experiences as a risk factor in aggravating existing psychopathology. In light of the aforementioned findings (Seitz et al., 2021) , it may be that certain pandemic features mirror previous experiences of childhood adversity and trauma (Taggart et al., 2021) . For instance, trauma survivors have previously reported feelings of entrapment to negatively influence their psychological health (Karatzsias, 2017) . The pandemic restrictions posed on social activities may reproduce this sense of entrapment by reflecting past abuse and neglect, ultimately resulting in re-traumatization (Jennings, 2009; Taggart et al., 2021) , and consequently, elevated levels of psychopathology. In support of this notion, some studies suggest that feelings of loneliness and a perceived lack of social support mediate the effects of childhood adversity and trauma on pandemic mental health (Seitz et al., 2021; Shreffler et al., 2021) , indicating that the pandemic consequences related to social restrictions are of particular concern for this at-risk group. However, it is also plausible that past experiences of childhood adversity and trauma are reflected by other pandemic ramifications, such as stay-at-home orders. This is particularly concerning due to the strong associations between childhood maltreatment and later adult intimate partner violence (Widom et al., 2014) , indicating that adults with a history of maltreatment in childhood are more likely to be engaged in adult relationships that exhibit violent behaviours. Past exposure to adverse and traumatic childhood experiences is further associated with having a low socioeconomic status (Fonta & Maguire-Jack, 2016) , indicating that the pandemic may confine these individuals within homes that offer limited opportunities to escape any abusive dynamics. As such, some of the pandemic restrictions may not only mirror past adversity and trauma, but also facilitate a recreation of the past adversity in a literal sense. This possibility is supported by a range of evidence gleaned from across the globe demonstrating a sharp rise in domestic violence during the pandemic (Office for National Statistics, 2020; Oliveira et al., 2020; Piquero et al., 2021) . Identifying the focal pandemic stressors in relation to this at risk-group is therefore essential both to identify avenues for alleviating further psychiatric escalation and to guide the installment of appropriate protective measures.",

            "text": "The potential re-traumatizing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic may also be reflected through the ways in which adversity and trauma-exposed individuals respond to the pandemic stressors. Individuals with a history of childhood adversity and trauma do not only display an inherent biological vulnerability to stressors (Hammen et al., 2000; Heim et al., 2019; Nusslock & Miller, 2016) , but also a propensity for employing maladaptive approaches to coping that increase the risk for psychopathology (Dorresteijna et al., 2019; Filipas & Ullman, 2006) . The maladaptive nature of coping is postulated to be shaped by the early adverse and traumatic experiences themselves, such as those involving abuse and neglect (Lahousen et al., 2019; Thomson & Jaque, 2017) . For example, in cases where the child maltreatment is perpetrated by a parental character, children may internalize a sense of deserving the mistreatment in an attempt to preserve their relationship with their attachment figure; a relationship that is pivotal to their survival (Lahousen et al., 2019) . This pernicious internalization may also take place in order for the children to gain a sense of control amidst the adversity, which could explain this response to instances of maltreatment by alternative adult perpetrators as well. In line with these postulations, a coping strategy that is strongly associated with exposure to childhood adversity and trauma is self-blame; that is, the tendency to blame and criticize oneself for exposure to adverse experiences (Dorresteijna et al., 2019; Filipas & Ullman, 2006) . This coping strategy, in turn, is related to higher levels of trauma-related psychopathology (Kline et al., 2021) , including depression (Zahn et al., 2015) . Thus, combined with the delineation of distinct stressors, variations of coping strategies may help explain some of the pandemic mental health disparities among individuals with a history of childhood adversity and trauma. This notion is supported by a growing body of literature demonstrating the mediating role of coping strategies in accounting for the effects of childhood adversity and trauma and subsequent stressors on adult psychological health (Kalial et al., 2020; Sheffler et al., 2019) . Coping strategies are further postulated to be contingent upon the nature of a particular stressor (Lazarus, 1981) , highlighting the importance of examining the ways in which individuals exposed to childhood adversity and trauma respond to the COVID-19 pandemic specifically; an unprecedented event comprising a range of potentially traumatic ramifications.",

Disentangling the COVID-19 pandemic and its stressors is essential to identify avenues for preventing and alleviating further escalation of psychological difficulties in this at-risk group. Moreover, addressing coping strategies within this complex risk and pandemic stressor relationship is imperative to inform interventions on what behaviours, affections, and cognitions to target. Together, the exploration of distinct pandemic stressors and coping strategies in relation to past childhood adversity and trauma and current psychopathology may help capture some of the most vulnerable individuals during the COVID-19 pandemic and prompt appropriate trajectories of rehabilitation.",

Participants received no monetary compensation. The survey further outlined a variety of helplines and websites that participants could use if they experienced psychological distress and needed assistance.

Of these, active coping, acceptance, humour, religion, denial, self-blame, substance use, and behavioural disengagement demonstrated skewness. Substance use and behavioural disengagement displayed more severe skewness, and inversion and log10 proved to be the most suitable transformation methods for these variables, respectively. All other variables with skewness were squared, except from active coping, because the distribution did not improve following any of the transformation methods. Further, 18 outliers were removed as they had a bearing on the results. The selection of a listwise inclusion of variables left 852 cases for the final analysis. Following the multivariate multiple regression analyses, mediation analyses explored the mediation effects of pandemic stressors and coping strategies in the relationship between adverse childhood experiences with depression and PTSD as outcome variables in two separate analyses. Pandemic stressors and coping strategies that showed the largest effect sizes in relation to adverse childhood experiences and depression and/or PTSD in the multivariate multiple regression analyses were included. This resulted in two mediation analyses that investigated the serial mediation effects of one pandemic stressor and one coping strategy in the relationship between adverse childhood experiences with depression and PTSD, which included 867 and 878 cases, respectively. The mediation analyses were conducted using the PROCESS macro v4.0 (Hayes, 2018) . Table 2 presents the means and standard deviations of all variables.

Hence, while previous research found that pandemic stressors related to social restrictions partially mediate the effects of Fig. 3 . Serial mediation of housing conditions and self-blame on the association between adverse childhood experiences and PTSD; *p < .01. childhood adversity on pandemic mental health (Seitz et al., 2021; Shreffler et al., 2021) , this study suggested that difficult housing conditions may be an even more concerning consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic for adults with a history of adverse and traumatic childhood experiences. The sense of entrapment that is suggested to negatively impact the mental health of adversity and trauma survivors during the pandemic (Taggart et al., 2021) may thus predominately be explained by stay-at-home orders; and the ensuing challenges might both mirror and recreate past experiences of child adversity and trauma. While difficult housing conditions has not previously been identified as the most challenging stressor related to the COVID-19 pandemic for adults with a history of adverse and traumatic childhood experiences, the surge of domestic violence during the pandemic (Office for National Statistics, 2020; Oliveira et al., 2020; Piquero et al., 2021) , together with evidence of the strong association of exposure to childhood adversity and trauma and later adult intimate partner violence (Widom et al., 2014) , lend some support to this finding.",

Secondly, the re-surfacing or mirroring of childhood adversity and trauma appears to be particularly detrimental when self-blame is employed as a coping strategy. The first point implicates the necessity of an increased attunement to the effects of childhood adversity and trauma with respect to social determinants of health. In particular, policy makers need to explore ways of improving the living circumstances of adversity-and trauma-exposed individuals during pandemics and other similar situations. For instance, the surge of domestic violence during the COVID-19 pandemic, together with the present findings, suggest that policy makers may need to consider whether some support centres for abuse victims should remain open during lockdowns. Moreover, it may be beneficial to develop a curriculum module for mental health and social workers that promote insight into ways of identifying detrimental housing conditions for adversity-and trauma-exposed adults and different avenues for alleviating them. The second point implicates the importance of employing a trauma-informed approach when helping childhood adversity and trauma-exposed individuals. The use of self-blame as a coping strategy, and its harmful effects on mental health, prompts the need for mental health professionals to help re-frame the victims' self-cognitions from 'what is wrong with me?' into 'what happened to me?' (Gilliver, 2018) . In this way, childhood adversity and trauma victims can become empowered to recognize the impact of their past experiences and begin the process of mitigating the internalized abuse; thus breaking free from abusive dynamics.",

For instance, the relationship between self-blame with depression and PTSD has been demonstrated previously to be of an intricate nature, with self-blame both leading to and resulting from mental health problems (Kline et al., 2021) . Thus, although the current mediation models suggest that the employment of selfblame precipitates psychopathology, it is likely that these variables influence each other within more complex multidirectional relationships.",

            "text": "Another important limitation presents itself in the representativeness of the sample. While the mean score of adverse childhood experiences in the sample is 0.65, suggesting that the majority of the participants have no past experiences with adversity during childhood, other studies suggest that most of the general population have been subject to at least one adverse event during childhood (Felitti et al., 1998) . For instance, a recent study investigated the frequency of adverse childhood experiences in a sample of 211,376 adults, and found the overall mean of adverse childhood events to be 1.56 (Giano et al., 2020) . The low mean of childhood adversity in the present sample may be partially explained by the participants' high level of education, as individuals with more experiences of childhood adversity tend to display lower educational attainment (Houtepen et al., 2020) . While the percentage of the population in Greece with university degrees is 29% (OECD, 2019), the percentage of the current sample is 72.9%. Thus, the conclusions that can be drawn from this study are somewhat curtailed by the biased representativeness of the sample.",

It is further the first to demonstrate the serial mediating effects of difficult housing conditions as a pandemic stressor and self-blame as a coping strategy in explaining the exacerbated clinical symptoms of individuals with a history of adverse and traumatic childhood experiences during the pandemic. This study thus provides an important contribution to the current literature by capturing some of the most psychologically vulnerable individuals during the COVID-19 pandemic. The results pinpoint the importance of exploring ways to alleviate stressors related to difficult housing conditions and to target self-blame cognitions to help individuals with previous exposure to childhood adversity and trauma as the COVID-19 pandemic continues, as well as in preparation for future pandemics and other similar situations.",
