            "text": "Autoimmune neutropenia is a benign disease typically presenting in infants or toddlers. In a large series of 240 children with autoimmune neutropenia the median age of onset was 8 months, all of them presenting before 3 years of age [6] , although the presentation may be beyond that age in early childhood [7] . The course is variable, with spontaneous resolution in most cases that may last several months or years. In two large series the median times of resolution were 17 months and 3 years, respectively [6, 7] . Although sometimes a genetic panel to detect the mutation of common genes associated with congenital neutropenia is performed [8] , it is not usually necessary when there is a high suspicion of autoimmune neutropenia [7] Children with autoimmune neutropenia rarely suffer from serious infections, since circulating neutrophils, although low in number, are normally functional, and therefore capable of defending the host against such infections. Furthermore, the severity and type of infections are poorly related with the neutrophil count. It is important to investigate other findings that may rise the suspicion of an underlying diagnosis, including dysmorphic features, hepatosplenomegaly, bone pain or chronic diarrhea. They tend to develop only minor infections of the upper respiratory tract, skin and soft tissues. By contrast, children who develop serious bacterial or fungal infections should be studied in greater depth to rule out immunodeficiencies and other causes of neutropenia. Although exceptional, severe infections have been reported in children with autoimmune neutropenia. Pyogenic liver abscesses in an 8-month-old boy and a 9-month-old girl diagnosed of autoimmune neutropenia have recently been reported [9] . There have been other isolated cases of neck abscesses [10] and persistent perianal abscesses [11] related to autoimmune neutropenia. In these severe cases a complete work-up to rule out immunodeficiencies should always be considered [9] .Therefore, we should bear in mind that autoimmune neutropenia, although rare, can be associated with severe infections, including abscesses.",

Some clinicians have suggested the potential benefit of prophylaxis with broad spectrum antibiotics. Nevertheless, there is no evidence of the benefit of this approach and side effects and resistance issues should be balanced in autoimmune neutropenia, even when the absolute neutrophil count is very low. Although it was common practice in the past [6] , routine antibiotic prophylaxis is not usually recommended nowadays [13, 14] .",
