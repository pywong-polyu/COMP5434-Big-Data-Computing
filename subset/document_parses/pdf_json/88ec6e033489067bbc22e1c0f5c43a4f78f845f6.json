Furthermore, our results suggest that the virus replication inhibition is due to an intracellular mechanism and not due to the dissociation between spike SARS-CoV-2 protein and its human receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 interaction.

So far there were more than 17 million confirmed patients in 213 countries, and more than 680,000 deaths due to COVID-19 disease, according to WHO data as of July 26, 2020 (https://covid19.who.int). Few medical procedures are available, which could reduce viral load, decreasing patient hospitalization time, virus dissemination and the number of patients with severe symptoms. SARS-CoV-2 uses a surface glycosylated spike (S) protein to bind human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) 3 , CD147 4 and sialic acid receptors 5 and to develop coronavirus disease . In the case of SARS-CoV, that shares 76% of identity with SARS-CoV-2 S protein, it has been suggested that the virus may also bind to host cells through DC-SIGN or L-SIGN receptors 6, 7 . SARS-CoV-2 and ACE-2 interaction is essential to mediate virus infection 8 . The S protein has two main subunits, the S1 subunit involved in binding to the host cellular receptor, and the S2 subunit that mediates fusion of the viral and cellular membranes. Initially, the homotrimeric S protein via its receptor binding domain (RBD) located at the S1 subunit, binds to human ACE-2 (hACE-2), causing a conformational change in the S1 and S2 subunits leading to the fusion of virus membrane with the host cell membrane 9, 10 .",

Interestingly, the interface between the RBD of S protein with hACE-2 is highly polar, involving charged residues located mainly at the hACE-2 interface and polar residues at the RBD interface 12 . These ionic interactions could in principle be affected by increasing the ionic strength and could be used to inhibit the interaction of the virus with the host cell. Moreover, the potential antiviral activity, in vitro, of sodium chloride (NaCl) has been already studied for RNA viruses, such as mengovirus 13 , respiratory syncytial virus, influenza A virus, human coronavirus 229E and coxsackievirus B3, and also for DNA virus, like herpes simplex virus-1 and murine gammaherpesvirus 68 14 . Furthermore, a randomised controlled clinical trial studying the effectiveness of the treatment for viral upper respiratory tract infection, using hypertonic saline nasal irrigation and gargle (HSNIG) 15 , observed a decrease in the duration of illness, over-the-counter medications use, transmission within household contacts and viral shedding 15 .",

We measured the effects of increasing concentrations of NaCl (135, 160, 185, 210, 235, 260 and 285 mM equivalent to 0.8, 0.9, 1.1, 1.2, 1.4, 1.5, 1.7%, respectively) on cell viability and their antiviral activity on SARS-CoV-2. Efficacies were evaluated by quantification of viral copy numbers in the cell supernatant via quantitative real-time RT-PCR (RT-qPCR) and confirmed with visualization of cytopathic effect by optical microscopy at 72 hours post infection (h.p.i.). Our data shows that 210 mM NaCl (1.2%) was sufficient to inhibit the virus replication by 90% (Fig. 1a) , achieving 100% of inhibition on 260mM (1.5%). Next, to determine which stage of virus replication was affected by the NaCl, we evaluated if viral inhibition was a direct effect of NaCl on the virus particles, for that SARS-CoV-2 was pre-incubated with media and increasing concentrations of NaCl for 1 hour before absorption. Virus pre-exposure to NaCl did not affect viral replication at any concentration of NaCl tested (Fig. 1a , VPI curve). The same pattern of absence of inhibition was observed when we treated the cells one hour before infection, analyzing the adsorption process, which consists of the interaction of virus with cell receptors (Fig. 1a, AD curve) . On the other hand, significant inhibition of viral replication (up to 50%) was seen when as little as 160 mM of NaCl was available during virus replication alone (Fig. 1a , p = 0.032, PI curve) or full-time, during adsorption and replication (Fig. 1a , p = 0.030, FT curve). There was no statistically significant difference between post-infection (PI) and adsorption plus post-infection (FT) treatments (p = 0.985). These data together suggest that SARS-CoV-2 inhibition in the presence of NaCl was an intracellular mechanism and was not due to the dissociation of spike SARS-CoV-2 and human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) complexes.",

During SARS-CoV-2 infection, pulmonary edema and cytokine storm are responsible for the most lethal scenarios 20 . The increased amount of liquid blocking the airway at the alveoli causes extreme injury, and a scar fibrotic tissue substitutes the lesioned tissue (Fig. 3a) . Along the embryonic pulmonary development, the organ is full of liquid, which is removed mainly by the action of sodium channels such as epithelial sodium (Na + ) channels (ENaC) that are sensitive to amiloride [21] [22] [23] [24] . These ENaC are expressed mainly by epithelial cells of many organs, such as kidney, lungs, colon, skin, and by some neurons in the brain 21 . In adulthood ENaC usually controls the concentration of Na + ions in the extracellular environment. Therefore, the channels are extremely important for the organism water balance, by controlling the reabsorption of Na + in kidneys, sweat and colon. In this way, the activity of ENaC can influence blood pressure and the renin-angiotensin system, as well as the thickness and dryness of the airway 21 .

Therefore, extracellular Na + imbalance through ENac inefficiency by SARS-CoV-2 infection may explain the formation of pulmonary fibrosis due to virus infection We observed mainly two patterns of depolarization: (1) lower doses of NaCl concentration triggered depolarization and after 180s the cell membrane reestablished the resting state, causing a timid inhibition of the virus release, while (2) doses higher than 210 mM could trigger a high amplitude depolarization, in which the cells needed periods longer than 24h to recover the resting state, causing over 90% inhibition of the virus. In the first situation, we hypothesize that activation of Ca 2+ sensitive K + channels and Na + /K + ATPase pump could recover the steady state, while in the second situation, we hypothesize that the over stimulation of Na x , ENaC and Ca2.1, would overwhelm the cell, consume the ATP production, thus stressing the mitochondria. Two types of Ca 2+ -dependent K + channels, small (SK) and big (BK) conductance, can be responsible for Ca 2+ -activated outward K + currents. While SK channels are expressed especially in the central nervous system and heart, being responsible for the afterhyperpolarization of excitable cells, BK channels are broadly expressed in mammalian cells. These two K + channel subtypes differ mainly in their single channel conductance, which is in the order of 10 pS for SK channels and 150-250 pS for BK channels 37 . This large K + conductance makes BK channels important for cell membrane repolarization, since BK channels are activated by membrane depolarization and/or high cytosolic Ca 2+ concentration ([Ca 2+ ] i ).",

Mitochondrial membrane potential can also be determinant for antiviral cell responses. In human embryonic kidney (HEK) and mouse embryonic kidney (MEF) cells, the application of mitochondrial uncoupler CCCP, which dissipates the transmembrane potential through the increase of membrane permeability, caused an impaired antiviral response by the cell 39 . This did not occur for the F 1 F O ATP synthase inhibitor oligomycin B, indicating that the diminished antiviral effect observed was associated with mitochondrial membrane depolarization, but not with impaired ATP synthesis alone. Our hypothesis shown in Fig. 3 b is that the overflow of Na + in Vero cells, followed by increased [Ca 2+ ] i , would cause an extreme low energy state (high ADP/ATP ratio), leading to impaired virus replication. Another possible effect is that the increased concentration of intracellular Na + that causes membrane depolarization results in a decreased intracellular K + concentration due to restoring the membrane potential. Thus, the imbalance of the intracellular K + concentration can affect the functioning of different potassium channels that are important for the life cycle of some viruses, as in the case of HIV 40 .",

In this way, protocols can be improved, and the evolution of their patients can be shared with the scientific community. Furthermore, findings from a post-hoc analysis of NCT02438579 clinical trial suggest that hypertonic saline nasal irrigation and gargling may have play a role in reducing symptoms and duration of illness caused by COVID-19 49 .

African green monkey kidney Vero cell line (ATCC CCL-81) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified eagle medium (DMEM), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1% nonessential amino acids (NEAA), 1% sodium pyruvate (Sigma-Aldrich Co., Deisenhofen, Germany) and incubated in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO 2 at 37\u00b0C. A clinical isolate SARS-CoV-2/SP02/human/2020/BRA (GenBank access n\u00b0 MT126808.1) was propagated in Vero E6 cells, and viral titer was determined by 50% tissue culture infective dose (TCID 50 ) and by plaque forming units per milliliter (PFU/mL), as previously described by Araujo and collaborators 52 . We conducted all the infection experiments in a biosafety level-3 (BLS-3) laboratory at the Institute of Biomedical Sciences, University of S\u00e3o Paulo, S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil, following the Laboratory biosafety guidance related to the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) by WHO 53 . Sodium chloride (NaCl) was diluted in free-DMEM that already contains in its composition 110 mM of NaCl. In that way we assumed seven plus additional increasing concentrations (25, 50, 75, 100, 125, 150 and 175 mM) of NaCl in the cell medium resulting in a final NaCl concentration of 135, 160, 185, 210, 235, 260 and 285 mM. Cell viability assays. For cell viability and stress, 5x10 4 cells on black clear bottom 96 well plates stained with the AlamarBlue\u2122 Cell Viability Reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific), according to manufacturer's instructions. Cells were stained and fluorescence intensity recorded at rest (point 0), 1h, 24hs and 72hs after NaCl challenge, using 530 nm for excitation and 560/590 for emission detection in the FlexStation III microplate reader. Data were normalized by a blank control that consists of cell medium for natural reduction conditions. Data are plotted as reference to the basal condition of 110 mM NaCl concentration (DMEM's salt concentration). Cell viability was further evaluated using a colorimetric assay by quantifying lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) released into the culture supernatant from cells with damaged membranes, using the CytoTox 96\u00ae Non-Radioactive Cytotoxicity Assay (Promega Corp., Madison, WI). Detection was performed using a microplate reader (POLARstar \u00ae Omega, BMG LABTECH, Ortenberg, Germany) at 492 nm. The activity of the released LDH was reported as a percentage of the total cellular LDH (measured after the complete lysis of control cells corresponding at the maximal amount that can be released by cells, therefore 100%). Cell viability was normalised to untreated cells (0 mM NaCl added). Viability below 70% was used as a threshold for cytotoxicity 54 . Cell death quantification. For cell death detection, we adapted a usual method for flow cytometry, based on staining live cells with the membrane impermeant dye, propidium iodide (PI), and the permeable fluorophore, Hoechst 33342. Since PI stains the dead cells, while Hoechst 33342 stains every cell in the dish, cell death rates were quantified by the total fluorescence intensity of the PI staining in the well, normalized by the total fluorescence intensity of the Hoechst 33342 55 . The recordings were acquired at rest (point 0h), 1h, 24hs and 72hs after NaCl challenge, using 535 nm for excitation and 617 nm for emission detection for PI, and 350 nm for excitation and 461 nm for emission of Hoechst 33342 in the FlexStation III microplate reader.

High levels of [Ca 2+ ] i can, besides triggering membrane depolarization on Vero cells, disturb [Ca 2+ ] i levels, which can lead to impaired viral replication. There is solid evidence that viral infections and the expression of viral proteins modify [Ca 2+ ] i , since Ca 2+ is an important second messenger and regulator of many cellular processes",
