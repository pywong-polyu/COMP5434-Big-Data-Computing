Unfortunately, information regarding the immunological characteristics of COVID-19 patients remains limited. Herein, we collected blood samples from 18 healthy donors (HDs) and 38 COVID-19 patients to analyse changes in the adaptive immune cell populations and their phenotypes. We observed that the lymphocyte percentage moderately decreased, CD4 and CD8 T cell percentage among lymphocytes were similar, and B cell percentage was increased in COVID-19 patients in comparison to that in HDs. T cells, especially CD8 T cells, showed an enhanced expression of late activation marker CD25 and exhaustion marker PD-1. Importantly,",

            "text": "A severe pneumonia-associated respiratory syndrome began in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, which was subsequently declared as a public health emergency of international concern by WHO. The novel coronavirus strain was officially named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). 1, 2 Coronavirus infections, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), can cause severe respiratory diseases. 3, 4 SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped positive-strand RNA virus, which belongs to the same family as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV based on genome similarity, Coronaviridae. 2, [5] [6] [7] A number of studies have demonstrated that the adaptive immunity responds to coronavirus infections and is required for efficient clearance of the virus. In patients infected with SARS-CoV, the acute phase of infection is associated with a severe reduction in T cell numbers in the blood, involving a dramatic loss of CD4 and CD8 T cells in comparison to healthy control individuals. 8, 9 This suggests that SARS-CoV infection impairs cellular immunity in the early stages of the disease. With the prolonged recovery time of SARS-infected patients, expression of activated T cell markers, such as CD69 and CD25, decreases, 10, 11 indicating that T cell activation in response to the virus is impaired. 12 With the improvement of the disease, the ratio of CD4 to CD8 T cells increases, indicating that CD4 T cells recover faster than CD8 T cells. 13 In addition, out of the 92% of cured SARS patients whose B cells initially declined and then increased or continued to increase during the course of the disease, only 8% had a constant or decreasing cell count. 14 Similar to SARS patients, leucopenia and lymphopenia are also observed in MERS patients, albeit to a lesser degree than that observed in SARS patients. A clinical study showed that 14% of MERS patients had leucopenia, while 34% of the patients had lymphopenia. 15 MERS-CoV-infected patients that exhibited distinctively high frequencies of MERS coronavirus-reactive CD8 T cells were associated with severe/moderate illness, whereas CD4 T cell response was minimally detected at this stage. In the convalescent phase, a moderate increase in CD4 T cells was detected. 15 Currently, very few studies have reported that COVID-19 patients develop lymphopenia and exhibit an increase in pro-inflammatory cytokines in severe condition. [16] [17] [18] The information on changes in immune cells and their functions in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection is still very limited. Based on the fact that T and B cells respond to infections and play critical roles in defending against virus infections, a systematic study on the changes in T and B cells in COVID-19 patients will help uncover the immune response against SARS-CoV-2 infection and will also provide insights for COVID-19 diagnosis and treatment.",

We showed that upon infection, lymphocyte percentage declined, CD4 and CD8 T cells percentage within the lymphocyte population remained unchanged, and B cell percentage was relatively increased. CD4 and CD8 T cells exhibited a mild and strong activation phenotype. Notably, the percentage of T follicular helper (Tfh)-and germinal centre B-like (GCB-like) cells increased. Similar phenotypes among the patients in various age groups indicate that aged individuals are also capable of responding to SARS-CoV-2 infection.

The patients present typical symptoms of pneumonia, such as dry cough, dyspnoea, fever and bilateral lung infiltrates on imaging. 25 Although post-mortem study has revealed intensive inflammation in lungs of the patients, little is known about the immunological features in response to this new virus. In the present study, we have focused on characterizing adaptive immune cell populations and their phenotypes in COVID-19 patients.

            "text": ",31 A number of studies have shown that PD-1 + CD8 + T cells increase in the peripheral blood of patients with a variety of acute viral infections, such as HBV, HIV and Ebola virus.32,33 In our study, the expression of PD-1 was up-regulated in both CD4 + and CD8 + T cells of COVID-19 patients, which may explain the observed reduction in the lymphocyte population.In response to viral infections, normally both CD4 + and CD8 + T cells become activated. In COVID-19 patients, we observed mild activation of CD4 + T cells but stronger activation of CD8 + T cellsbased on CD25 expression. This reflects that CD8 + cells are major responders of COVID-19 infection and are consistently activated. It is possible that CD4 + T cells may be strongly activated earlier during the infection and then revert to the quiescent state after providing helper functions, which could explain the undetected activated phenotype. This could be explained by the comparable expression of CD69, an early activation marker, in HDs and patients. CD4 + T cells may indeed be weakly activated in response to the virus, which warrants further studies. During viral infections, the antigen-specific immune response is executed by Tfh and GCB cells.
