However, factors associated with the duration of recovery among admitted patients remained uncertain. Therefore, we assessed factors associated with time to recovery from Covid-19 among hospitalized patients at the treatment center in South Central, Ethiopia. We employed a retrospective cross-sectional study among 422 patients hospitalized at Bokoji Hospital treatment center with Covid-19 from July 1, 2020, through October 30, 2021. Data were entered, coded, and analyzed using SPSS 26 version. We computed the survival probability using the Kaplan Meier method and determined factors associated with time to recovery using Cox regression analysis. Finally, the interpretation of adjusted hazard ratio (AHR) with 95% Confidence Interval (CI) and P-values less than 0.05 were declared as statistically significant. Our study found that the median time to recovery from Covid-19 infection of 13 days, with an IQR of 9-17 days. In multivariate Cox regression, \u2265 60 years old (AHR = 0.66; 95% CI: 0.49, 0.895), chronic pulmonary disease (AHR = 0.67; 95% CI: 0.455, 0.978), Male (AHR = 0.77; 95% CI: 0.611, 0.979), and being on Intranasal oxygen care (AHR = 0.56; 95% CI: 0.427-0.717) were significantly associated with time to recovery. Thus, health providers in treatment centers should give strict follow-up and priority for elders, patients with underlying diseases, and under supportive treatment during case management.",
