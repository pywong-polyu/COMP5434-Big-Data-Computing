            "text": "The COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 has a significant burden on the economy and healthcare around the world. Vaccines are the most effective tools to fight infectious diseases by containing the spread of the disease. The current vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 are mostly based on the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, which is large and has many immune-dominant non-neutralizing epitopes that may effectively skew the antibody response towards non-neutralizing antibodies. Here, we have explored the possibility of immune-focusing the receptor binding motif (RBM) of the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 that induces mostly neutralizing antibodies in natural infection or in vacinees. The result shows that the scaffolded RBM can bind to Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) although with low affinity and induces a strong antibody response in mice. The immunized sera can bind both, the receptor binding domain (RBD) and the spike protein, which holds the RBM in its natural context. Sera from the immunized mice showed robust interferon \u03b3 response but poor neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 suggesting presence of a predominant T cell epitope on scaffolded RBM. Together, we provide a strategy for inducing strong antigenic T cell response which could be exploited further for future vaccine designing and development against SARS-CoV-2 infection.",

            "text": "Coronavirus disease 2019 , caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused a global health concern since its first emergence in Wuhan, China in December 2019. It spread rapidly across countries causing the pandemic of the millennium due to its prolific inter human transmission capacity [1, 2] . Till the end of March 2022, in about 2 years since its first identification, there have been over 450 million cases worldwide and over 6 million deaths. The novel betacoronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 is a positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus (+ssRNA) and is closely related to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus), the pathogens responsible for the SARS epidemic of 2002, and the MERS epidemic in 2012 respectively [3, 4] . Also, being a RNA virus it undergoes mutations that is driven by the low fidelity RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) leading to the recent emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants [5, 6] . SARS-CoV-2 infection causes lower respiratory tract infection and elicits range of clinical presentations, from asymptomatic infection to severe viral pneumonia that may lead to multiple organ failure and death [7] . In the absence of standard medical intervention for COVID-19, current clinical management comprises mainly of supportive care [8, 9] . The surface glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2, the spike (S) protein is a homotrimeric glycoprotein on the virion surface and is a type I viral membrane fusion protein. Each monomer is composed of two subunits, the S1 subunit is responsible for binding to the host receptor and the S2 subunit facilitates membrane fusion [10] . The receptor binding domain (RBD) is located in the S1 subunit and binds with the Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) present on the host cell surface [4] . In addition to ACE2 recognition, the RBD is also responsible for eliciting neutralizing antibodies and has become a highly-investigated target for vaccine and drug development [3, 11, 12] .",

Several vaccines and antibody therapeutics with good reported efficacy are now available for use while others are in the different stages of development and clinical trials [13] . However, current method and techniques of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine production is expensive. At present, there is a massive disparity in the global distribution of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines [14] . To control the COVID-19 pandemic in low-and middle-income countries (LMICs) where most of the global population resides, a great increase in sustainable supply of affordable vaccines is urgently needed [15, 16] . Different approach of vaccine development against SARS-CoV-2 is predominantly focused on presenting the spike glycoprotein as antigen to the host. The protein subunit based vaccine approach is the development of vaccine candidate using purified viral protein(s) as antigen that is capable of inducing neutralizing antibodies. For enveloped viruses the protein subunit based vaccine development mostly targets the viral structural protein(s) produced and purified as soluble recombinant protein which is highly immunogenic and provides protection [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] . However, designing and development of soluble protein subunit based vaccine candidate for the viral pathogen is challenging. The viral proteins are large, complex and have posttranslational modifications such as glycosylation as the viral pathogens use complex protein synthesis system of their eukaryotic host such as mammal [22] [23] [24] [25] . The recombinant protein production in mammalian system incurs high cost due to low yield, costly reagents and complex downstream processing [7, 26] . Contrary, the prokaryotic system is cost effective because of high yield and cheap upstream and downstream stages. However, enveloped subunit protein based vaccine production in prokaryotic expression system is not successful so far as the viral protein produced in prokaryotic system forms non native-like structure and often form large protein aggregates or expressed in low quantity or found in inclusion bodies [27, 28] . Secretory recombinant proteins produced in yeast results in high mannose hyperglycosylation, a major issue as it potentially alter functional properties of the proteins [29] . Ongoing efforts are being made to produce the RBD protein of SARS-CoV-2 in Pichia pastoris and E. coli. [30, 31] .",

The most immunogenic epitope of the spike protein that induces neutralizing antibodies, the receptor binding motif (RBM) present within the RBD, was placed in the middle of two CH3 domains of mouse IgG1 flanking at the either end. The idea here is that the CH3 domains at the either end will fold on itself to dimerize and exposing the RBM loop, possibly in a flexible native-like conformation, as present in the context of RBD, enabling it to bind to its receptor ACE2. The integrity of the design approach was first analyzed by using protein modeling approach and then further characterized by biochemical and biophysical experiments. Next, in order to understand the cellular and humoral response we immunized BALB/c mice with the scaffolded RBM protein. Our result suggests that the designed immunogen binds ACE2 with high nanomolar affinity confirming presence of native like conformation and also induced robust antibody titer in immunized mice. The immunized sera bind with the RBD and the trimeric spike protein suggesting the potential of the induced antibodies to bind to RBM in the context of RBD or full length trimeric spike protein. Moreover, the immunized mice showed a profound induction of antigen specific IFN\u03b3 by T cells as compared to the unimmunized mice. Surprisingly, immunized mice sera showed poor neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 virus in plaque reduction neutralization test (pRNT) using live viruses suggesting the presence of a predominate T cell epitope in the designed protein, while there remains a possibility of improvement in the design to induce potent neutralizing antibodies.",

The RBD within S glycoprotein is structurally defined as a region between two cysteine residues (C336 and C525) that form a disulfide bridge. The detailed structure of SARS-CoV-2 RBD bound to ACE2, highlighting the key regions of the RBD responsible for ACE2 binding has been determined and explained by Lan et al. [4] . The RBD mostly consists of extensive \u03b2-sheets structure with a short linear segment called receptor binding motif (RBM) that contains most of the amino acid residues making contact with the ACE2. Most of the neutralizing antibodies identified so far for SARS-COV-2, irrespective of their source of origin, such as monoclonal antibodies isolated from patient sera or neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) generated in mice, or antibodies isolated through phage display techniques [41] , have their binding surface on or close to the RBM region of RBD [42] . The mechanism of neutralization by these nAbs is mainly through direct competition with ACE2 for binding to the RBD. This suggests that the epitopes near the ACE2 binding site is not only immunogenic but induces nAbs. The other parts of the RBD might induces non neutralizing antibodies or neutralizing antibodies that work through allosteric mechanism (destruction of spike), such as CR3022, but not directly interfere with ACE2 binding [43] . This is important from a vaccine development standpoint, especially for designing RBD-based immunogens, because if the non neutralizing epitopes are highly immuno-dominant, they can potentially skew the dominance of non-neutralizing antibodies or interfere with the induction of nAbs.",

Thus the designed immunogen will selectively display only the RBM to the host immune-system through an immune-focusing approach. Hence, it is expected that such designed construct if maintain a native like conformation of the RBM will also bind to ACE2 and induce conformation dependent neutralizing antibodies for SARS-CoV-2. As scaffold protein we choose a self antigen, the CH3 domain of IgG1 antibody of the host, to minimize the chance of inducing antibodies directed against the scaffold. The overall design strategy is shown in Fig. 1A and B. The CH3 domain is placed at the either end of the RBM such that when the two CH3 domains fold on itself and dimerize, the RBM loop is displayed as is present on the RBD.

As expected, the best 3D models obtained after molecular modeling were mostly aligned with the structure of the Fc domain of antibodies available in the structural database. To further improve the model structure a multi-template based algorithm of modeller 10.0 [34] was used with the top 10 templates obtained from I-TASSER server. The Ramachandran plot generated by the Procheck server for the best fit model showed 63.6% of the residues in the most favored regions, 30.9% of the residues in the additionally allowed regions, 3.6% of the residues in the generously allowed regions, and 1.8% of the residues in the disallowed regions (Fig. S2A) . The best fit model then subjected to energy minimization for structural refinement using 3Drefine server [36] . The final structure was put on the Procheck server [35] to check out for the favourable distribution of torsional angles -phi (\u03c6) and psi (\u03c8) -of the amino acid residues as defined by the Ramachandran plot for structural validation. The final modeled structure showed 75.3% of the residues in the most favored regions, 19.6% of the residues in the additionally allowed regions, 4.0% of the residues in the generously allowed regions, and 1.1% of the residues in the disallowed regions in the Ramachandran plot ( Fig. 1B and S2B) . Secondary structure estimation of the final modeled structure using I-TASSER showed 4.1% \u03b1-helix, 36 .6% \u03b2-sheet and 59.3% of random coil ( Table 1 ). The final structure has an RMSD of 19.53 \u00c5 with the RBM loop and an RMSD of 0.94 \u00c5 with the dimerized CH3 domain (Fig. 1C and S3) . The modeling confirms that the designed Table 1 Estimation of secondary structure content a) based on amino acid sequence (predictive method using GOR IV), b) based on the final modeled structure (predictive method using I-TASSER) and c) based on circular dichroism data of the purified protein (using BeStSel). All methods gave a comparable estimation of the secondary structure. immunogen have the potential to adopt a structure where the two CH3 domain of the IgG1 folds on itself to form a dimer and the RBM loop is displayed on the CH3 scaffold with some deviation as it present on the RBD structure. The overall RMSD of the structure is inflated as the RBM structure is trapped between two rigid CH3 terminals, however, the secondary structure contents are considerably stable. A high resolution structure would have provided a better insight of the final modeled structure particularly for the native-like conformation of the RBM loop. Indeed, in the absence of actual structure, we based our study on the modeled structure of the designed immunogen.",

Extrapolation from the calibration curve of Superdex 200 increase 10/30 column estimates the molecular weight as 37 kDa, suggesting that the protein is monomeric in solution ( Fig. 2A and S4) .

To measure the binding affinity and kinetics of RBM-CH3(scaffold) to ACE2 we performed biolayer interferometry (BLI). For this purpose, ACE2-Fc protein was captured on the anti-hIgG Fc capture (AHC) biosensor and titrated with different concentration of RBM-CH3(scaffold). Based on the binding kinetics the calculated apparent affinity of RBM-CH3(scaffold) to ACE2 was 350 \u00b1 100 nM with an on rate of 4.5 \u00b1 0.5 \u00d7 10 3 (1/Ms) and off rate of 1.6 \u00b1 0.3 \u00d7 10 \u2212 3 (1/s) (Fig. 2D) . Suggesting that the RBM-CH3 (scaffold) binds with ACE2 with 20 fold less affinity compared to the soluble RBD protein [45, 46] . This suggest that the RBM loop in the designed RBM-CH3(scaffold) construct maintains native-like conformation to some extant enabling the RBM-CH3(scaffold) to bind to ACE2. This is important from the vaccine design prospective to induce conformational antibodies that binds with the RBM in its original context and interferes with the attachment of ACE2 with the spike protein and thereby neutralizes the SARS-CoV-2 virus entry to the host cell.",

In each case very good titer of the whole sera was seen for each of the antigens and after boosting the titer increased considerably as expected. Highest antibody titer was seen for the RBM-CH3(scaffold) antigen that was used for immunization with significant increase in binding titer after first boost. Second boost further improved the titer (Fig. 3B) . The sera also showed significant binding titer for the RBD protein as well as the soluble prefusion spike protein ( Fig. 3C and D) . No ELISA binding was seen for any of the antigen for sera from the control group of mice.

To confirm whether the immunized sera could also bind to the cell surface expressed spike protein, HEK293T cells transiently transfected with the full-length spike protein was probed with the pooled immunized serum.

The cell surface expressed spike protein was detected in immuno-fluorescence when probed with Alexa Fluor 488 labeled rabbit anti-mouse IgG antibody for the immunized serum only (Fig. 4B and S5) .

Our result indicated a heightened IFN\u03b3 response in immunized mice for both antigen specific and non-specific expansion suggesting induction of Th1 response by the immunized protein. Interestingly, IFN\u03b3 secretion was increased by more than 2-fold for both CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell population. IFN\u03b3 is well documented to directly inhibits viral replication and enhances the antigen presentation [47] . Moreover, we also found elevation of IL4 (in CD8+ T-cells) and IL17A (in both CD4 and CD8+ T-cells) secretion suggesting that the designed immunogen displays potent T cell epitopes and may generate strong inflammatory response (Fig. 5) . The data for T-cell response suggest that the designed immunogen has significant potential to induce T cell population which is important for strong anti viral activity and virus clearance.",

The neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 so far identified from different sources including natural infection, vaccinees and animal immunization induces antibodies against the RBM and are conformational in nature [42] . The mechanism of neutralization by these antibodies is mainly by direct competition with ACE2 for binding to the RBD. No neutralizing antibodies are so far reported for SARS-CoV-2 that binds to a linear peptide chain of spike glycoprotein and hence a linear peptide based approach of immunogen design may not be successful [49, 50] . Moreover, peptides alone are not immunogenic enough to induce sufficient titer of antibodies [51, 52] . The challenge here was to present the selected epitope on a protein scaffold such that it adopts a conformation which mimics the conformation of RBM present on the spike protein on the surface of SARS-CoV-2 and remove rest of the redundant part of the protein to minimize off target immune response.",

The RBM region is flexible and forms a loop like structure. B) Schematic presentation of the designed vaccine. The RBM region of RBD (AAs 416-525) shown in red, is sandwiched between two CH3 domains (yellow) of IgG1 at the either end of RBM. The final energy minimized 3D model is shown below the schematic presentation. The two CH3 domains at the either end fold to dimerize and thereby exposing the RBM loop on the CH3 scaffold. C) Superimposed image of 3D model structure is shown with the CH3 domain (PDB ID: 6HYG) in green and the RBM loop of RBD (PDB ID: 7BJW) in blue. The modeled structure is shown in red (RBM) and yellow (CH3) respectively.
