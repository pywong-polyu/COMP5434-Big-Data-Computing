            "text": "In this study, we develop and analyze a nested multi-scale model for COVID -19 disease that integrates within-host scale and between-host scale sub-models. First, the well-posedness of the multi-scale model is discussed, followed by the stability analysis of the equilibrium points. The disease-free equilibrium point is shown to be globally asymptotically stable for R0 < 1. When R0 exceeds unity, a unique infected equilibrium exists, and the system is found to undergo a forward (trans-critical) bifurcation at R0 = 1. Two parameter heat plots are also done to find the parameter combinations for which the equilibrium points are stable. The parameters \u03b2, \u03c0 and \u039b are found to be most sensitive to R0. The influence of within-host sub-model parameter on the between-host sub-model variables is numerically illustrated. The spread of infection in a community is shown to be influenced by within-host level sub-model parameters, such as the production of viral particles by infected cells (\u03b1), the clearance rate of infected cells by the immune system (x), and the clearance rate of viral particles by the immune system (y). The comparative effectiveness of the three health interventions (antiviral drugs, immunomodulators, and generalized social distancing) for COVID-19 infection was examined using the effective reproductive number RE as an indicator of the effectiveness of the interventions. The results suggest that a combined strategy of antiviral drugs, immunomodulators and generalized social distancing would be the best strategy to implement to contain the spread of infection in the community. We believe that the results presented in this study will help physicians, medical professionals, and researchers to make informed decisions about COVID -19 disease prevention and treatment interventions.",

            "text": "Mathematical modeling of infectious diseases is one of the highly researched area in applied mathematics. Mathematical epidemiology has contributed to a better understanding of the dynamic behavior of infectious diseases, their impact, and possible future predictions of their spread. In general, the transmission of an infectious disease system is a consequence of processes acting on at least two different scales, ie, within-host and between-host scales [18, 15] . At within-host scale there are three ways in which the transmission of an infectious disease system is regulated that is, when the immune system impacts the dynamics of an infectious disease system in a population: first, by regulating pathogen dynamics at within-host scale; second, by affecting herd immunity at between-host scale; and finally, by altered immuno-demography through change in the immune status due to age, disease, or therapy. There are number of studies on infectious disease systems which has established that transmission of infectious diseases depends critically on within-host scale processes. In particular, these studies established that the transmission potential of an infectious host increases with increasing pathogen load in the infected host [18] . Studies on HIV and dengue virus transmission established a sigmoid functional relationship between host infectiousness and within-host scale pathogen load [26, 30] . Other studies that have also confirmed a similar functional relationship between host infectiousness and within-host scale pathogen load include [20] for malaria, and [21] for human T lymphotropic virus. Studies such as [12, 2] considered transmission rate at between-host scale as a linear function of viral load. Several within-host and between-host compartment models are developed to study the spread of COVID-19 infection at individual level as well as at community level. Some of the important mathematical modelling studies that deal with transmission and spread of COVID-19 at between-host level can be found in [7, 23, 25, 39, 32, 28, 40, 24, 38, 10, 41, 4, 33] . Within-host mathematical modelling studies that deal with the interplay between the viral dynamics and immune response of COVID-19 disease can be found in [8, 36] .",

Though the exact functional relationship between viral load, transmission rate and disease induced death rate is not known [2] , as in [12, 2] we considered a linear form of the coupling functions \u03b2 and d: \u03b2(V (s)) = \u03b2V (s) and d(V (s)) = dV (s). We also observe that the first three equation of the between-host SEIR sub-model is independent of recovered population R(t). Therefore without loss of generality we omit the last equation of the between-host SEIR sub-model.

To overcome these problems, we simplify the multi-scale model by using the within-host scale sub-model to define another quantity, which we use as a proxy for the infectivity of the individual host and which is called the area under the viral load curve [17, 14] .

In this study, we develop a nested multi-scale model for COVID-19 disease that integrates the within-host scale and the between-host scale sub-models. The transmission rate and COVID-19 induced death rate at between-host scale are assumed to be a linear function of viral load. Because of the difficulties of working at two different time scales, we approximate individual-level host infectiousness by some surrogate measurable quantity called area under viral load and reduce the multi-scale model at two different times scales to a model with area under the viral load curve acting as a proxy of individual level host infectiousness.",

The disease free equilibrium point of the model is found to remain globally asymptotically stable whenever the value of basic reproduction number is less than unity. As the value of basic reproduction number crossed unity a unique infected equilibrium point exists and remains stable depending on the sign of (AB \u2212C). The model is shown to undergo a forward (trans-critical) bifurcation at R 0 = 1. To predict the sensitivity of the model parameters on R 0 , elastic index that measures the relative change of R 0 with respect to parameters is calculated for each parameters in the definition of R 0 . The parameters \u03b2, \u03c0 and \u039b were found to be most sensitive towards R 0 . The theoretical results are supported with numerical illustrations. To separate out the region of stability and instability of the equilibrium points, two parameter heat plot is done by varying the parameter values in certain range. The influence of the key within-host scale sub-model parameters such as \u03b1, y and x on between-host scale are also numerically illustrated. It is found that the spread of infection in a community is influenced by the production of virus particles by an infected cells (\u03b1), clearance rate of infected cell (x) and clearance rate of virus particles by immune system (y).",

The result suggested that a combined strategy involving treatment with anitviral drugs, immunomodulators, and generalized social distancing would be the best strategy to limit the spread of infection in the community. However, implementing a combined strategy may not be always cost-effective or feasible. In a single intervention strategy, general social distancing has been shown to lower the value of R 0 better than individual use of antiviral drugs and immunomodulators. Therefore, in a situation where resources are limited and costly, interventions such as restricting mass gatherings, wearing masks, temporarily closing schools, etc., would be highly effective in containing infection and also more costeffective. We believe that the results presented in this study will help physicians, doctors and researchers in making informed decisions about COVID-19 disease prevention and treatment interventions. ",
