Screening tests using rectal swabs from 171 diarrheic and 378 healthy cats collected from Henan, Anhui, and Zhejiang provinces in China revealed two samples from diarrheic cats that were positive for cachavirus, but statistical analysis indicated no association between the presence of the virus and clinical signs (p > 0.05). Subsequently, two partial genome sequences [from nucleotides 479-4123, according to the strains from dogs (cachavirus)] of the two strains from cats (cachavirus-cat1 and -cat2) were amplified. The NS1 and VP1 sites of cachavirus-cat1 and -cat2 shared a high identity of 91.9 and 97.0% with reported cachaviruses, respectively, but lower identity of 74.8 and 73.2% with another carnivore chaphamaparvovirus named fechaviruses detected in cats, respectively, indicated the two strains might origin from dogs. These findings improve our understanding of the diversity and tropism of viruses in Carnivore chaphamaparvovirus species 1 which now include both dogs and now cats viruses.",

Bat (Eidolon helvum) parvovirus 2 (EHPV2) was first reported in bats in 2013 (2) , and then it was identified in other bats such as the fruit bat (E. helvum) parvovirus 1 (3) and bat (Desmodus rotundus) parvovirus (4) . Studies have reported that expanding its host spectrum of chaphamaparvoviruses, these viruses were also identified in mammals such as mice (5, 6) , simian (7) , swine (8) , and Tasmanian devils (9) . Other chaphamaparvoviruses were also identified in birds, including red-crowned cranes (10) , turkeys (11) , peafowl (12) , and chickens (13) . More notably, two strains of Cachavirus-1A (MH893826) and Cachavirus-1B (MK448316), were also identified in dogs in the United States in 2019, and the cachavirus which belonged to Carnivore chaphamaparvovirus species 1 had three open reading frames (ORFs) encoding a 663-amino acid non-structural protein 1 (NS1), a 504-amino acid capsid protein (VP1) and a 210-amino acid putative nucleoprotein (NP) (14) . More recently, another ChPV named fechavirus was detected in feline outbreak of diarrhea and vomiting and reported in May 2020 (15) . To better understand the host range of members of the Carnivore chaphamaparvovirus species 1, we collected samples from healthy and diarrheic cats to investigate whether the cachavirus or fechavirus was present in cats in China.",

From the structure prediction diagram of NS1 in Figure 2 , the two obtained cachaviruses demonstrated minimal differences in tertiary structure modeling with Cachavirus-1A, and some mutation sites of the two strains did not change the NS1 protein structure of the virus. For the mutation of the VP1 structural protein, this possibly indicates that four mutations of Cachavirus-cat1-CNC181031-VP1 are the cause of these changes (Ile56Thr, Tyr68Cys, Phe131Ser, and Asp402Asn). The tertiary structure modeling of Cachavirus-cat1-CNC181031-VP1 was significantly changed, indicating that mutations at these amino acid sites may cause changes in the structure of the protein. However, further studies are warranted to investigate whether site mutations would lead to changes in its function and pathogenesis. Simultaneously, the structure of Cachavirus-cat2-CNC190520-VP1 also changed compared with Cachavirus-1A, suggesting that the changes at Tyr22His and Gln365Arg lead to the changes in its structure.
