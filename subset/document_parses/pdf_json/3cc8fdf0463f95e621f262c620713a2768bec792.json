Metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1 (MALAT1) is a long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) that is involved in tumorigenesis. This study was designed to explore the role of exosomes from oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL)-treated vascular endothelial cells (VECs) in regulating DCs maturation in AS, and to elucidate whether MALAT1 was involved in this process. Methods: Human umbilical VECs (HUVECs) were treated with or without ox-LDL, after which exosomes were isolated and then co-cultured with immature DCs (iDCs). The phenotypic profile and cell endocytosis in DCs were examined to assess the degree of maturation of DCs. The interaction between MALAT1 and NRF2 protein in DCs was evaluated using RNA pull-down assay and RNA immunoprecipitation. A mouse model of AS was eatablished by feeding ApoE knockout (ApoE \u2212/-) mice with a high-fat diet for 12 weeks. Results: The ox-LDL-HUVECs-Exos exhibited lower MALAT1 expression when compared with HUVECs-Exos. Furthermore, exosomes from ox-LDL-treated MALAT1-overexpressing-HUVECs (ox-LDL-HUVECs-Exos Lv-MALAT1 ) released elevated expression of MALAT1 to iDCs, which interacted with NRF2 and activated NRF2 signaling, and thereby inhibited ROS accumulation and DCs maturation. Further in vivo experiments showed that a decrease in MALAT1 content in mouse VECs-Exos might be associated with mouse AS progression. Conclusion: Loss of exosomal MALAT1 from ox-LDL-treated VECs induces DCs maturation in atherosclerosis development.",

Data revealed that LPS downregulated protein levels of NRF2 and NRF2 signaling downstream genes including HO-1 and NQO1 (Figure 3(a) ). Furthermore, LPS treatment decreased NRF2 nuclear translocation, a key step of NRF2 signaling activation (Figure 3(b) ). These data indicated that LPS significantly inhibited NRF2 signaling. Importantly, HUVECs-Exos treatment attenuated the LPS-mediated inhibition of NRF2 signaling. ox-LDL-HUVECs-Exos showed weaker attenuation when compared with HUVECs-Exos group (Figure 3(a,b) ). Importantly, compared with ox-LDL-HUVECs-Exos Lv-ctrl , ox-LDL-HUVECs-Exos Lv-MALAT1 significantly upregulated protein expression of NRF2, HO-1, and NQO1 (Figure 3 (a)) and increased NRF2 nuclear translocation (Figure 3(b) ). These data indicated that upregulation of MALAT1 expression in exosomes from Lv-MALAT1-transfected ox-LDL-HUVECs activated NRF2 signaling in DCs. In addition, compared with ox-LDL-HUVECs-Exos Lv-ctrl group, ox-LDL-HUVECs-Exos Lv-MALAT1 significantly decreased ROS content (Figure 3(c) ). Thus, our findings suggested that exogenous overexpression of MALAT1 from ox-LDL-HUVECs-Exos activated NRF2 signaling and thereby inhibited ROS accumulation in DCs.",

Results of RNA pull-down assay showed that NRF2 was abundantly detected in the pull-down complex of MALAT1 (Figure 4(a) ). Furthermore, results of RIP assay further confirmed the binding between MALAT1 and NRF2, as indicated by abundantly expressed MALAT1 when using the NRF2 antibody as compared to using the nonspecific antibody (IgG control) (Figure 4(b) ). To verify how MALAT1 expression in DCs regulated NRF2, we overexpressed and silenced MALAT1 in DCs to examine the effect of MALAT1 expression on NRF2 signaling. Data revealed that MALAT1 overexpression significantly upregulated protein levels of NRF2, HO-1, and NQO1 ( Figure  4 (c)) and increased NRF2 nuclear translocation (Figure 4(d) ). In contrast, MALAT1 knockdown exerted the opposite effects (Figure 4 (e,f)). These findings indicated that MALAT1 upregulation in DCs activated NRF2 signaling, whereas MALAT1 downregulation in DCs inhibited NRF2 signaling.",

These findings indicated the potential protective role of MALAT1 in AS. Several studies have shown that MALAT1 play different roles through exosomes as a medium of transmission. For example, exosomal MATAL1 from human adipose-derived stem cells promoted ischemic wound healing [26] and traumatic brain injury recovery [27] . Exosomal MALAT1 derived from oxLDL-treated HUVECs promoted M2 macrophage polarization [28] . Delivery of MALAT1 mediated by breast cancer cells-secreted exosomes induced cell proliferation in breast cancer [21] . Our in vivo assay showed that MALAT1 expression from AS mouse sera-derived exosomes showed an opposite trend to AS progression, indicating that a decrease in MALAT1 content from mouse VECs-Exos was associated with AS progression. Thus, the above-mentioned findings support our notion that MALAT1 has potential antiatherogenesis effect in AS.",

As one of the master regulators of anti-oxidative responses, NRF2 plays critical roles in the regulation of activation [9] , maturation [10] , and immune tolerance [11] of DCs. Furthermore, NRF2 activation exerts antiatherosclerosis effects [7] and attenuates ox-LDLinduced endothelial cell injury [8] . Our results showed that exogenous overexpression of MALAT1 from ox-LDL-HUVECs-Exos interacted with NRF2 and activated NRF2 signaling in DCs, and thereby inhibited ROS accumulation. Recent evidence indicates that ROS production promotes maturation and activation of DCs [24] . Hence, we may suggest that exogenous overexpression of MALAT1 from ox-LDL-HUVECs inhibited DCs maturation by interacting with NRF2 and activating NRF2 signaling.",

Recent data also revealed that antagonism of MALAT1 downregulated NRF2 in multiple myeloma cells [30] .

DCs are present in their immature forms in non-diseased arteries and become activated during atherogenesis. Some DCs cluster with T cells directly within atherosclerotic lesions, while others migrate to lymphoid organs to activate T cells [3, 4] . The interaction between endothelial cell-derived microvesicles/exosomes and DCs was complicated and requires further investigation [31] [32] [33] . In the present study, our in vitro results showed that exogenous overexpression of MALAT1 from ox-LDL-HUVECs-Exos inhibited DCs maturation. Further assays in AS model mice demonstrated that mouse VECs-Exos treatment alleviated AS progression. In addition, a decrease in MALAT1 content in mouse VECs-Exos might be associated with mouse AS progression. However, whether the mechanism underlying the protective effect of VECs-Exos on AS was associated with MALAT1-mediated regulation of DCs maturation remains to be further studied.",
