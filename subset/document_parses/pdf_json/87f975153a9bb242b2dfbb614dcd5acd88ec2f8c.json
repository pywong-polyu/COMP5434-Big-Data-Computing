We sought to identify antiviral targets through genome-wide characterization of SARS-CoV-2 proteins that are crucial for viral pathogenesis and that cause harmful cytopathic effects. All twenty-nine viral proteins were tested in a fission yeast cell-based system using inducible gene expression. Twelve proteins including eight non-structural proteins (NSP1, NSP3, NSP4, NSP5, NSP6, NSP13, NSP14 and NSP15) and four accessory proteins (ORF3a, ORF6, ORF7a and ORF7b) were identified that altered cellular proliferation and integrity, and induced cell death. Cell death correlated with the activation of cellular oxidative stress. Of the twelve proteins, ORF3a was chosen for further study in mammalian cells. In human pulmonary and kidney epithelial cells, ORF3a induced cellular oxidative stress associated with apoptosis and necrosis, and caused activation of pro-inflammatory response with production of the cytokines TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, and IFN-\u03b21, possibly through the activation of NF-\u03baB. To further characterize the mechanism, we tested a natural ORF3a Beta variant, Q57H, and a mutant with deletion of the highly conserved residue, \u2206G188. Compared to wild type ORF3a, the \u2206G188 variant yielded more robust activation of cellular oxidative stress, cell death, and innate immune response. Since cellular oxidative stress and inflammation contribute to cell death and tissue damage linked to the severity of COVID-19, our findings suggest that ORF3a is a promising, novel therapeutic target against COVID-19.",

Although current vaccines are effective in preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection, breakthrough infections are not uncommon. Moreover, the emergence of new viral variants could undermine the effectiveness of current vaccines. Antiviral drugs are an alternative, potentially effective means to curtail COVID-19 but currently such drugs are limited. The discovery of new antiviral agents is hampered by limited knowledge of the pathogenicity of the virus and of which viral protein(s) should be targeted.

It is one of the 7 human coronaviruses (hCoVs) that cause human diseases that range from the common cold to SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome). Like other hCoVs, SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped, positive-sense (+), single-stranded RNA virus with an average genome size of 29.7kb. Upon viral entry into a host cell, the (+)ssRNA viral genome is released into the cytoplasm where the two overlapping open reading frames 1a and 1b (ORF1a and ORF1b) are translated to produce two polyproteins, which are further processed by viral proteases to generate a total of 29 SARS-CoV-2 proteins including 4 structural proteins, spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N), 16 nonstructural proteins (NSP1 -NSP16), and 9 accessary ORFs (3a, 3b, 7a, 7b, 8, 9b,9c and 10) (2).

We adapted a unique integrated approach, viz., a well-established fission yeast cell-based system to conduct genome-wide and functional analyses of the viral proteins, with the goal of identifying proteins that cause harmful cytopathic effects. Fission yeast (Schizosaccharomyces pombe) is a haploid single-cell eukaryotic organism that has been used extensively as a model to study human cancer biology (4) and viruses (5) (6) (7) (8) . Fission yeast is a well-tested model system for the study of highly conserved cellular activities (9, 10) such as the cytopathic effects caused by viral proteins, including inhibition of cell proliferation, interruption of cell structural integrity, and induction of apoptosis and necrosis (5) . Fission yeast cell-based systems also have been shown to be suitable for antiviral drug testing and drug discovery (6, 11) .",

A total of 29 viral ORFs representing all viral proteins produced by the SARS-CoV-2 genome were expressed using inducible nmt1 promoter-mediated transcription in a wild type fission yeast strain SP223. Fission yeast cells expressing an empty cloning plasmid pYZ1N were used as a cloning vector (Vec) control. The effect of the SARS-CoV-2 protein expression on the ability of fission yeast to form colonies, an indication of cell proliferation, was measured on minimal selective agar plates (11, 12) . All cells with viral genes repressed (gene-off) formed normal size colonies on the agar plates ( Fig. 1A; Fig. S2A ). In contrast, 8 non-structural viral protein-producing fission yeast cells (NSP1, NSP3, NSP4, NSP5, NSP6, NSP13, NSP14 and NSP15) and 4 accessory proteins (ORF3a, ORF6, ORF7a and ORF7b) showed either complete inhibition or near complete inhibition of yeast colony formation on minimal selective agar plates (Fig. 1A) . In each case, either no colony or very small colonies were observed under viral gene-inducing conditions, consistent with cellular growth inhibition. With the Vec control, normal size colonies were observed on both gene-suppressing (gene-off) and gene-inducing (gene-on) plates, confirming the specificity of the viral protein effect observed. We named the 12 viral proteins the \"cytopathic proteins\".

            "text": "Changes in cell morphology such as hypertrophy are linked to SARS-CoV-2induced cytopathic effects in human airway epithelial cells and myocytes (14) . To determine whether the SARS-CoV-2 cytopathic proteins affect cell morphogenesis, we compared microscopic cell morphologies between fission yeast cells with or without viral protein production. Control cells containing the Vec-carrying plasmid appeared normal under both gene-suppressing and gene-inducing conditions. Cells were typical rod-shaped with diameters of 3-4 \u00b5M and lengths of 7-14 \u00b5M. They were shiny on the edges, a sign of healthy cells ( Fig. 2A) (9) . Normal cell morphologies also were observed in cells that carried the 12 cytopathic protein-encoding plasmids under the gene-suppressing conditions. In contrast, expression of the 12 SARS-CoV-2 cytopathic proteins under the gene-inducing conditions resulted in various degrees of hypertrophic morphologies ( Fig. 2A , bottom rows of each panel). The common features of the abnormal cell morphologies included cell elongation and enlargement. We further analyzed the overall changes in cell morphology caused by the 12 cytopathic proteins. Both the forwardscattered light (FSC) and side-scattered light (SSC) were measured for each cell population of 10,000 cells using flow cytometric analysis (Fig. 2B) . The FSC is relative to the cell surface area, and thus measures cell size. The SSC is related to cell granularity, and thus determines intracellular complexity. Combined analysis of FSC and SSC provide an overall architectures of cell shapes in a heterogeneous cell population. As shown in Fig. 2B , there were significant differences in the cells' overall architectures between the gene-off and gene-on cultures of cells with cytopathic proteins. In contrast, there were no clear differences between the gene-inducing and gene-repressing Vec-carrying fission yeast cells, suggesting the observed morphological changes were SARS-CoV-2 protein-specific. The production of all other SARS-CoV-2 proteins did not induce clear cellular hypertrophy (Fig. S3B) . Together, our observations suggested that the 12 cytopathic proteins cause various degrees of cellular hypertrophy.",

Of the identified cytopathic proteins, ORF3a was chosen for further study because it plays an important role in viral pathogenesis and its activities are linked to lung tissue damage and a cytokine storm in COVID-19 (16) (17) (18) . Since we found that ORF3a-induced cell death was associated with the induction of cellular oxidative stress in fission yeast (Fig. 3) , we tested whether a similar ORF3a effect is produced in mammalian cells, including human pulmonary epithelial A549, Calu-3 and kidney epithelial 293T cell lines. After transfection of the ORF3a-carrying plasmid into A549 and 293T cells, cell growth over time was measured, and cell viability and cell death were evaluated by the MTT method and trypan blue exclusion. As shown in Fig. 4A -B, the expression of ORF3a in either the A549 or the 293T cells significantly reduced cell growth, decreased cell viability, and increased cell death in comparison with the mock and the vector controls (Ctr). Possible effects of ORF3a-induced cell death via apoptosis or necrosis were evaluated by a RealTime Glo Annexin V Apoptosis and Necrosis assay. As shown in Fig. 4C-a-b , ORF3a-induced cell death involved both necrosis and apoptosis. ORF3a-induced apoptosis was mediated at least in part through the cleavage of caspase-3 ( Fig. 4C-c) . In addition, the expression of ORF3a triggered a cellular oxidative stress response, as measured by DHE staining (Fig. 4D) . Our results suggest that ORF3a-induced apoptosis and necrosis in mammalian cells are associated at least in part with the induction of a cellular oxidative stress response.",

A natural mutant variant (Q57H) that is associated with the ongoing Beta variant, and deletion of a highly conserved guanine residue (\u2206G188) were tested. The \u2206G188 mutant was chosen because the amino acid (a.a.) 188 is highly conserved among sarbecoviruses, a subgenus of \u03b2-coronaviruses. G188 may be structurally important as it is one of the two guanidine resides that separate two antiparallel \u03b24 and \u03b25 sheets, and both residues are in the proximity of two homodimers of ORF3a and are within the inner cavity of the protein (19) . The same methods as described above (Fig. 4) were used to measure cell growth, cell viability and apoptosis and necrosis with the ORF3a mutants. In comparison with wildtype ORF3a, the \u2206G188 mutant showed significant differences in its effects including markedly reduced cellular growth, viability and increased cell death over time ( Fig. 5A -a-c, red bars). In contract, the Q57H mutant showed slightly improved cellular growth, viability and reduced cell death ( Fig. 5A -a-c, blue bars). Overall, the effects of the two ORF3a mutants on cellular growth and viability were inversely correlated with the effects on overall cell death ( Fig. 5A-c) , apoptosis and necrosis (Fig. 5B) . Compared to wildtype ORF3a, the \u2206G188 mutant markedly increased apoptosis and necrosis, whereas the Q57H mutant showed reduced apoptosis and necrosis. Consistent with the idea that ORF3ainduced cell death is mediated through the induction of cellular oxidative stress, a positive correlation also was seen between the wildtype and mutant ORF3a in the production of ROS (Fig.  6) . Based on these observations, ORF3a-induced apoptosis and necrosis are likely mediated through the induction of cellular oxidative stress, and the overall structure of the ORF3a protein appears to be important for the induction of cell death.",

Both Q57H and \u2206G188 mutants were tested in comparison with the wildtype ORF3a. While the Q57H mutant showed a similar immune expression profile as the wildtype ORF3a ( Fig. 5D -a, blue bars), sharp increases in TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, and NF-\u03baB were observed with the \u2206G188 mutant ( Fig. 5D -a, red bars), suggesting a strong correlation between the level of apoptosis and necrosis induced by the \u2206G188 mutant and the level of TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, or NF-\u03baB. To further test whether other cytokines or pattern recognition receptors that recognize dsRNA virus also respond to the expression of ORF3a, we measure gene transcription of type I interferon beta-1 (IFN-\u03b21), Toll-Like receptors 4 (TLR4) and Toll-Like receptors 3 (TLR3). Similar or slightly reduced activation of IFN-\u03b21, TLR4 and TLR3 was observed in the Q57H mutant compared with the wildtype ORF3a ( Fig. 5D-b) , whereas sharp increases of IFN-\u03b21, TLR4 and TLR3 were observed with the \u2206G188 mutant ( Fig. 5D-b) . Interestingly, there were temporal differences in the activation of the various cytokines and regulators. The increase in TNF-\u03b1 began as early as at 24 hpt and was significantly reduced at 72 hpt ( Fig. 5D-a) . In contrast, no significant increase of signals of NF-\u03baB or TLR4 or TLR3 was seen at 24 hpt, but mRNA production gradually increased from 48 to 72 hpt, suggesting these might be late events. The two type I interferons, IFN-\u03b21 and IL-6, showed a significant spike at 48 hpt. These observations suggest that there is an active interaction between the expression of ORF3a and the host cellular innate immune responses.",

            "text": "Two major types of viral proteins were identified, viral enzymes and viral proteins that participate in viral replication or transcription (20) . Among the viral enzymes, NSP5 encodes the major 3Clike protease (3CL pro ), NSP3 produces a minor papain-like protease (PL2 pro ), NSP13 encodes a viral helicase that unwinds duplex RNA or DNA with a 5'\u21923' polarity, and NSP14 is a dual function enzyme with N-terminal exoribonuclease (ExoN) and C-terminal N7-methyltransferase (N7-MTase) activities. All these viral enzymes are highly conserved among coronaviruses and are essential for viral replication (20) . Therefore, they might be ideal targets for antiviral drug discovery. Notably, viral proteases are proven antiviral targets against HIV-1 (21) and HCV infection (22) . Some of the FDA-approved HIV-1 and HCV protease inhibitor drugs inhibit 3CL pro or PL2 pro (23, 24) . Although no clinical benefit has yet been shown from using those repurposed drugs, they nevertheless indicate the potential of using protease inhibitor drugs in treating COVID-19. The successful development of the first protease inhibitor antiviral drug Paxlovid (PF-07321332) against SARS-CoV-2 by Pfizer (25) attests this possibility. The fission yeast 3CL pro or PL2 pro cell-based assays described here could conceivably be used for high-throughput screening and testing of future SARS-CoV-2 protease inhibitors. This is certainly feasible because our early study shows that all FDA-approved HIV-1 protease inhibitor drugs suppress HIV-1 protease in the fission yeast cell-based system (11) . NSP13 also shows dNTPase and RNA 5'-triphosphatase activities besides its helicase activity. NSP13 is the most conserved coronaviral protein and it is essential for viral RNA transcription and replication. Therefore, it is another promising viral target for antiviral drug development (26) .",

ORF3a-induced apoptosis has been reported previously (36) . However, oxidative stress-induced cell death had not been reported in SARS-CoV-2 infection, and the viral protein(s) responsible for inducing cellular oxidative stress had not been identified. Here, we report for the first time that ORF3a not only induces ROS production leading to cellular oxidative stress, but this cellular stress response appears to be a common feature of all the viral proteins except NSP14 that link to cell death in fission yeast cells (Fig. 3C, shown by  arrows) . Whether the activation of cellular oxidative stress also contributes to the death of human cells caused by other viral proteins besides ORF3a remains to be elucidated. Oxidative stress is a common cellular response to viral infection (37) . Sustained viral infection leads to accumulation of the ROS in cells or tissues that may result in tissue damage and cell death (38, 39) . Increasing evidence suggests that excessive ROS production is a major cause of local or systemic tissue damage and contributes to the severity of COVID-19 (40, 41) . Therefore, targeting these viral targets could potentially help ease COVID-19. It is unclear at present why NSP14-induced cell death did not trigger a cellular oxidative stress response. One possible explanation is that it functions as an enzyme that is part of normal cellular activity.",

            "text": "ORF3a-induced apoptosis and necrosis might also be attributed in part to the activation of a cellular pro-inflammatory response, as three of the common pro-inflammatory cytokines, TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, and IFN-\u03b21, were all elevated ( Fig. 4E; Fig. 5D ). Clinical studies suggest that high serum IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 levels are strong, independent predictors of patient survival (42, 43) , and that hyper-inflammatory responses in patients with COVID-19 are a major cause of disease severity and death (42, 43) . ORF3a-induced apoptosis and necrosis might be one of the viral factors that contributes to the elevation of IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 observed in these patients. Our data show that elevated production of IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 could be mediated through NF-\u03baB, a well-recognized master regulator that mediates cellular pro-inflammatory responses to viral infection (44) . In addition, TLR3 and TLR4 might also be involved in these elevations, as they are also activated (Fig. 5D) . Both TLR3 and TLR4 recognize dsRNA viruses and trigger antiviral production of type I IFNs and proinflammatory cytokines. TLR4 is a cell membrane receptor (45) and TLR3 resides on the endosomal membrane in epithelial cells (46) . TLR3 induces pro-inflammatory cytokine production through TRIF (46); whereas TLR4-mediated pro-inflammatory cytokine production is likely through NF-\u03baB. Both TLR3 and TLR4-mediated pro-inflammatory responses contribute to the severity of the COVID-19. TLR4-mediated production of IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 is associated with the severity of COVID-19 in patients with cardiometabolic comorbidities (47) . Inhibition of TLR3 by famotidine decreases IL-6 (48) and reduces the risk of intubation and death in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 and alleviates symptoms in non-hospitalized patients with COVID-19 (49) . Both cellular inflammation and oxidative stress contribute to the severity of the COVID-19 (50) . In addition, ORF3a-induced apoptosis and necrosis are a highly conserved cellular response among yeast (this study), Drosophila (51), and human cells (36) . Therefore, targeting ORF3ainduced apoptosis and necrosis could be a promising antiviral strategy to fight against COVID-19. Fission yeast could potentially be used as a surrogate system for large-scale drug screening and testing of anti-ORF3a inhibitors.",

            "text": "The \u2206G188 mutant triggered much stronger activation of the cellular oxidative stress and innate immune responses compared to wildtype ORF3a (Fig. 4-5) . Early protein structural analysis suggests the G188 residue may be structurally important, as it is one of the two highly conserved guanidine resides among sarbecoviruses that separate two antiparallel \u03b24 and \u03b25 sheets, and both residues are in the proximity of two homodimers of ORF3a and are within the inner cavity of the protein (19) . The \u2206G188 mutant may interrupt the structure of the two antiparallel \u03b24 and \u03b25 sheets at the C-terminal end or the inner cavity where it affects ion channel activity or interaction of ORF3a with host cellular proteins. Structurally, the ORF3a activity has been linked to seven sequence motifs from the signal peptide (a. a. 1-15 ) of the N-terminus to a di-acidic motif (a.a. 171-173) (16, 36) . This is the first demonstration of the functional relevance of the G188 residue at the \u03b24/\u03b25 junction of the C-terminus of ORF3a in the activation of cellular stress, innate immune response, and induction of apoptosis and necrosis. Additional mutagenesis studies are needed to confirm our findings. One possible explanation for the stronger effect of the \u2206G188 mutant comparted to wildtype is that the wildtype ORF3a effect might be restricted by a host restriction cellular protein(s) through direct protein-protein interaction as shown in other viral infection (52) . If this is indeed the case, interruption of the ORF3a protein with the host restriction factor(s) by the \u2206G188 mutation could releases the ORF3a resulting enhanced triggering of host cellular stress and innate immune response leading to stronger cell death. This scenario is further suggested by the fact that the wildtype ORF3a completely kills fission yeast cells but only partially kills human cells. Note that ORF3a-induced cell killing in fission yeast is not an artifact caused by protein overproduction, as viral proteins with similar molecular weight such as NSP8 and 17 other viral proteins did not cause cell killing, nor do they induce the ROS under the same experimental conditions. It would be of interest to identify the binding partner(s) of the ORF3a in human cells.",
