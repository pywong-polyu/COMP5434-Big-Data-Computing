Before surgery, patient underwent SLED (sustained low efficiency dialysis) as per nephrologist's advice in view of hyperkalemia and deranged arterial blood gas analysis. Procedure was initially attempted laparoscopically. However, in view of dense inflammation around the kidney, conversion to open surgery was done. Left subcostal incision was made and nephrectomy was completed. Large bowel could be dissected off the kidney. Left kidney was necrotic with multiple pockets of purulent fluid around the kidney. Perirenal fascia appeared thickened. Hilar vessels were encased in inflammatory tissue. Kidney was densely adherent to the posterolateral abdominal wall. A 28Fr abdominal tube drain was placed before the closure of incision. Towards the end of surgery, patient developed hypotension and metabolic acidosis. The blood loss was about 600ml. Despite blood transfusion, vasopressors and therapy for metabolic acidosis, patient could not be extubated. Patient was shifted to ICU and put on ventilatory support. During the post operative period, patient was managed with ventilatory support, antibiotics and other supportive care. In view of oliguria and persistent metabolic acidosis, nephrology consultation was done. Hemodialysis was done as per nephrologist's advice. Histopathology report of the nephrectomy specimen showed mucormycosis. Broad PAS positive hyphae (5- (Fig. 2) and extensive necrosis (Fig. 3) were seen in the kidney. Liposomal Amphotericin B was started as per the intensivist advice on fourth post operative day. On fifth post operative day, patient developed sudden bradycardia for which resuscitation was done but patient developed cardiopulmonary arrest and could not be reviewed.",

Choudhary GR et al. 4 has reported a case mucormycosis in a young male following recovery from COVID-19. This patient had simultaneous renal and bowel involvement. This patient was initially managed conservatively. Subsequently he underwent left-sided nephrectomy via the retroperitoneal incision. Intra-operatively, bowel appeared ischemic and congested for which an exploratory laparotomy was performed and gangrenous segment of the bowel beginning from the third part of duodenum till proximal jejunum was resected. This patient developed severe metabolic acidosis, septic shock with anuria and succumbed to his illness after 10 hours. We also had a multi-disciplinary team approach for the management of our patient both in the preoperative and post operative period. Despite our best efforts we could not save the patient. Our patient had poorly controlled diabetes and already had acute kidney injury when he reported to our centre.",
