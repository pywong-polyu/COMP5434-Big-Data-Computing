Data were drawn from Waves 7 and 8 of the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE) (N = 39,172). We regressed network size, contact frequency and network satisfaction on the Big-5 personality traits, using a single path analysis structure, controlling for country, sociodemographic background and health status. The findings showed that the personality traits were related to the social network outcomes, but their effect was modest and less predictive than the contextual factors. The country predictors explained the most variance, generally, with some surprising results. For example, confidant networks were the largest in Scandinavia and Central Europe, and smallest in the Mediterranean region and Eastern Europe. Among the personality traits, extraversion was the most consistent positive predictor, but conscientiousness was also predictive. Neuroticism was a negative predictor, but not of network size. The sociodemographic variables, particularly partner status, explained more variance than the personality traits did. In sum, the SHARE database offers a comprehensive and differentiated view of the complex interpersonal milieus in which older Europeans are embedded.",

It is also known, however, that social networks tend to vary across different individuals, in terms of their structure, function and quality (Berkman et al. 2000; Kohli et al. 2009; Unger et al. 1999 ). Thus, not everyone benefits in the same way, or to the same degree, from the inter-personal constellation in which he or she is embedded. What is it that accounts for the differences that may emerge in social network structure, function and/or quality in later life?",

Such attributes and, particularly, age-related differences in personality patterns have been the focus of research attention for decades. A fivefactor structure of personality, that was first introduced in the late 1980s, stands until today as the prevailing conceptual construct for the identification and understanding of individual personality differences (John and Srivastava 1999; Lang et al. 2001) . The five factors, widely known as \"the Big Five\", include: (1) openness to experience (vs. closedness), (2) conscientiousness (vs. lack of direction), (3) extraversion (vs. introversion), (4) agreeableness (vs. antagonism) and (5) neuroticism (vs. emotional stability). A review of the literature reveals that personality traits are variously related to a range of important outcomes in late life, including morale (Loke et al. 2011) , successful aging (Dumitrache et al. 2019) , cognition (Cerino et al. 2020; Colombo et al. 2020; Power et al. 2017) , loneliness (von Soest et al. 2020) and mortality (Rizzuto et al. 2017) .",

These social constellations are complex entities, however, and they reflect a range of characteristics. Much of contemporary gerontological research in this domain focuses upon three key aspects of the social network, namely, network structure, function and quality (Huo et al. 2020 ). In addition, a large part of recent research concentrates on the personal social network (or egocentric network), that is, the specific collection of social ties that are most meaningful to a given person (Cornwell et al. 2009 ). Different aspects of the social network are variously related to outcomes of gerontological interest, such as life satisfaction (Rafnsson et al. 2015) , resilience (Park et al. 2021) , psychological distress (Phongsavan et al. 2013 ) and mortality (Ellwardt et al. 2015; Lund et al. 2000) .",

As for the five main personality traits, noted earlier, the most examined trait in relation to network structure, function and quality is, perhaps, extraversion. Thus, for example, a study based on social network data from the National Social life, Health and Aging Project (NSHAP) in the US found that extraversion (as well as agreeableness) was related to what the investigator called \"tie strength,\" and it was also weakly associated with friend network size (Iveniuk 2019) . In an earlier study in West Berlin of adults, aged 70 to 104, extraversion correlated with overall network size (Lang et al. 1998 ). Analysis of an Irish sample revealed that extraversion in that sample was among the predictors of social support, a network function measure (Schnittger et al. 2012 ). Finally, a study of older Facebook users found that those with a high level of extroversion (and openness) had a greater number of Facebook friends and group memberships (Mo et al. 2018) .",

This wave provided several of the sociodemographic variables as well. SHARE Wave 8 (2019-2020) added the three network outcome variables, and the marital and health status indicators, insofar as these latter background statuses may have changed since the previous wave. The number of respondents having the necessary data from both the waves under consideration totaled 39,172 persons from 26 countries (See Table 1 for the full list of countries). The large attrition in Wave 8 (n = 33,529) is explained mostly by the fact that SHARE data collection was necessarily stopped, early in 2020, due to the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. Some 30,599 Wave 7 respondents were missing from Wave 8 due to the early cessation of data collection, or to natural dropout that occurs between waves in longitudinal studies. A small number of respondents died after Wave 7 (n = 2,448), or were missing the social network data in Wave 8 (n = 482). We performed T-tests to compare the background and health variables across the two groups, that is, the study participants and the dropouts. The comparison revealed several differences.",

[Those with no cited confidants were assigned the lowest score on contact frequency-one (never)]. Network satisfaction was tapped on a scale from 0 to 10, the higher the score, the greater the satisfaction.

Table 2 presents the results of the multivariate analyses that were executed by means of the single path analysis structure. In Model 1A, network size was regressed on the background variables. As may be seen, all the variables were positively associated with this network outcome, except for age, which was negatively related. The model accounted for 14 percent of the variance. Model 1B added the health variables, both of which were positively associated with network size. The associations of the other variables in the model and the explained variance remained about the same. In Model 1C, we see that the addition of the personality traits added one more percentage point to the explained variance, and that three of the traits (openness, extraversion and agreeableness) were significant, each with a positive association with network size. The other two traits, however, were unrelated. The effects of the other variables in the model remained significant.",

The countries whose respondents were the least satisfied with their networks came from a variety of regions: Latvia and Slovakia (Eastern Europe), Belgium and France (Central Europe) and Malta and Greece (the Mediterranean). In order to estimate the relative explanatory power of \"country\" compared to that of the sociodemographic variables, we ran a supplementary series of regressions, here too using a single path analysis structure (see Supplementary Table 2 ). For network size, the variance explained by country was about 10 percent, while the addition of the sociodemographic variables increased the explained variance by another three and a half points. Country explained more than eight percent of the variance in contact frequency, and the sociodemographic variables added another five percent. In the network satisfaction measure, country accounted for two and a half percent of the variance while the background variables added another one and a half more points. These statistics show that country was the most predictive among the contextual variables.

In that study, the investigators found a stronger influence of contextual rather than personality factors on social functioning in late life (Lang et al. 1998 ). In our present analysis, we examined the correlates of three aspects of the personal social network: size, contact frequency and network satisfaction. These particular measures reflect each of the three key domains of the network phenomenon, namely network structure, function and quality. In each of these domains, the personality traits added only a relatively small amount to the explained variance. They explained more of the variance than did health status, but less than the variance accounted for by the sociodemographic background and country variables. We also examined whether different personality characteristics relate differently to social network structure, function and quality. In this regard, we considered two specific research questions. First, do extraverted older Europeans have a greater number of confidants, that is, do they have larger personal social networks? We assumed that they would, insofar as this particular personality trait exudes sociability, activity, and assertiveness (Erlich and Litwin 2019) . The multivariate analysis confirmed the association between extraversion and network size, although it was rather weak. Interestingly, two other personality traits had slightly stronger positive associations with network sizeopenness and agreeableness. More research on these two traits is warranted. Extraversion also positively correlated with contact frequency and network satisfaction. Moreover, it was the only personality trait among the five to achieve a significant positive correlation with all three of the network outcomes in the study, after controlling for the effects of the other study variables. It seems, therefore, that extraversion is, indeed, the most consistent personality predictor of meaningful social connectedness in all its facets among older Europeans, even if the effect, per se, is rather small.",

Nevertheless, one recent study in this domain provides some insight concerning the findings on conscientiousness in the present analysis. Drawing on data from the Health and Retirement Study in the United States, Steptoe and Jackson (2018) defined conscientiousness as one of five life skills that lead to better individual functioning over all, and to better social functioning in particular. They found, in their analytical sample (mean age = 73), that having more life skills was associated with stronger social relationships. This conclusion parallels the findings in the current study. Europeans with greater conscientiousness did not report having a greater number of confidants (network size), but they did have greater contact frequency and greater satisfaction from the social ties that they maintained. In other words, conscientiousness did not increase the number of close ties that one had, but it did seem to strengthen the interaction with them as well as the quality of the relationships.",

Conscientiousness emerged as an additional positive, if understudied, factor in relation to personal social network.
