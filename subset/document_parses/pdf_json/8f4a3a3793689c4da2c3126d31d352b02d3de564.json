            "text": "At the root of the crisis: a legal loophole that many for-profit air ambulance companies have used to their financial advantage. The legal ambiguity is encoded in the Airline Deregulation Act (ADA) of 1978, established to free airlines from government regulation and thereby allow the market to set prices for air travel. Congress passed the law to encourage competition among airlines and reduce the cost to consumers, and indeed, when controlled for inflation, the cost of a plane ticket has come down considerably since the ADA was passed. The 1978 law makes no provision about how air ambulances should be treated, however. This is, perhaps, understandable, given that the first hospital-based helicopter service for civilians wasn't established until 1972; and similar organizations were so slow to emerge that 8 years later, in 1980, a mere 39 emergency medical services helicopters were flying nationwide, as Karan Chhabra, MD, lead author of the 2020 Health Affairs study, noted in a comprehensive blog post.",

            "text": "Since the ADA's passage, air ambulances have existed in a gray zone: If they are airline carriers, they shouldn't be regulated, but at the same time, they haven't been subject to much in the way of market forces because their customers are patients who are in no position to shop around for deals. As such, the air ambulance business offered an opportunity to make a lot money, although it wasn't until 2002, when Medicare officials significantly increased the reimbursement rate for helicopter air ambulance transport, that investors started taking notice: private equity firms aggressively elbowed in on the business. A 2017 article prepared by Consumer Reports noted that before 2002, most air ambulances were owned and operated by hospitals, whereas for-profit operators were virtually nonexistent. Since then, forprofit companies have come to dominate the market to the point at which, in 2016, the industry's 3 biggest firms controlled 73% of the total helicopters, according to a 2017 Government Accountability Office report. \"It went from a local hospital-based community service to one that is largely owned and operated by a few international private equity firms,\" said Michael Abernethy, MD, the chief flight physician for University of Wisconsin Health's Med Flight, in Madison, WI, who has closely monitored the air ambulance industry for the last 3 decades. For more perspective on how the industry has changed, consider that although air ambulance transports made up less than 1% of total ambulance claims in 2011, they represented 8% of the total Medicare spending on ambulance services, as the Consumer Reports study found.",

Markets work. The problem is, the patient and the health plan are foreclosed from participating in a market transaction. In fact, they are not even told how much the flight will cost. The ADA is reliant on markets for its very success and cannot perform its intended function in the absence of a market.\" Some have called it price gouging. State legislators were concerned enough that a number of them tried to fight the practice. But that effort, paradoxically, ultimately helped put the profiteers in a stronger position to cash in: air ambulance companies sued the states and courts ruled that the businesses should be treated like airline carriers, rather than ambulances. \"In 2008 we started seeing the legal decisions that really made it easy for air ambulance operators to charge these really high prices,\" said Dr. Chhabra, \u00a7 a resident in the Department of Surgery at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, MA.",

And the way the private equity operators have rigged the system, they might not be able to find one anyway.\" He pointed out that, for Medicare and Medicaid patients, balance billing for air ambulance bills is prohibited, and said that it should be banned for the privately insured, too, so that patients are responsible only for predictable costs, such as co-payments and deductibles. Sensing that these issues may eventually be addressed in Washington, some for-profit air ambulance companies now employ their own lobbyists.",

The Lower Health Care Costs Act has strong bipartisan support, as well as the backing of some powerful congressional leaders. Nonetheless, it's in jeopardy of never being passed.

            "text": "Although surprise billing, including air ambulance bills, was a hot topic for Congress as recently as this year, possibly because of extensive coverage of the issue by media outlets such as the New York Times, Kaiser Health News, Vox, and others, \"the virus has put it on the back burner,\" said Dr. Chhabra. (Lawmakers on Capitol Hill considered folding a surprise billing element into a coronavirus relief package, but that legislation never passed and wouldn't have addressed the air ambulance problem anyway.) Nonetheless, the press may have already pushed one of the largest air ambulance outfits, Air Methods, to revamp itself. The number of privately insured in-network patients whom the company serves increased from just 5% in 2015 to nearly 50% this year, and they are engaged in ongoing talks about going innetwork with the \"Big Three\" insurance companies, Aetna, Cigna, and United Healthcare. Air Methods reported that its new approach has grown out of concern for its patients: \"In the past, health insurance companies were doing right by their customers and paying for emergency care, regardless of network status,\" said Doug Flanders, director of communications and government affairs for Air Methods. \"However, when they began to deny or underpay for emergency care, we proactively began to work to go in network.\" Dr. Abernethy would disagree. \"Air Methods was one of the companies that was absolutely notorious for balance billing patients,\" he explained. \"They were in the papers every week for going after patients for forty thousand, fifty thousand.\" It was as a result of all the spilled ink, Dr. Abernethy said, that the company began negotiating with insurance companies. \"They see the writing on the wall: the public will not tolerate [balance billing],\" he noted. \"They have changed their tune 180 degrees.\" Whatever the reason for Air Methods' remodeling, it's seen by many as a positive development, and change of the kind that some other for-profit air ambulance companies are strenuously resisting. Their lobbyists have long helped stall surprise-billing legislation and may continue to succeed in their efforts, Dr. Chhabra said. Indeed, Dr. Bai pointed out that at least one company with plenty at stake is spending more than ever to influence the folks on Capitol Hill: \"A large air ambulance provider [Air Medical Group Holdings] is among the largest spenders on lobbying in Q1 [fiscal quarter 1] 2020, with a 49% increase from Q4 2019,\" 1 she said. \"It will take substantial political will and strong resistance to industry influence for the passage [of The Lower Health Care Costs Act] to happen,\" said Dr. Bai. \"It is unclear at this moment whether these necessary ingredients are in place for the bill to . become law.\" (Annals asked a spokesperson for Global Medical Response, the parent company of Air Medical Group Holdings, to weigh in. \"GMR's [Global Medical Response's] goal is always to keep the patient out of the middle and to work with private insurers to achieve tangible solutions that provide patients the emergency air medical services they need, without putting them in financial hardship,\" said public relations manager Nicole Lee.)",

And who are we calling? Good actors who will do right by patients or an outfit that will send a balance bill?'

Despite the traumatic circumstances, Dr. Harper left the ED marveling, not least because of the sense of commonality she'd felt with the other people in the waiting room. \"All of us had converged.to reveal our wounds, to offer up our hurt and [for] our pain to be eased,\" she observed in her new memoir, The Beauty in Breaking. She added, \"Unlike in the war zone that was my childhood, I would be in control of that space, providing relief or at least a reprieve to those who called out for help.\" After getting her undergraduate degree from Harvard University, she went on to the Renaissance School of Medicine at Stony Brook University. Her book, a New York Times bestseller, relates the experiences she's had practicing emergency medicine in the South Bronx and Philadelphia as one of only about 2% of US physicians who are Black women, 1 including a time when a drunk patient punched her in the face and a shift when police officers pressured her to search the stomach of a man they brought in, although they had no court order. Dr. Harper also described many moments of renewal and hope, however. \"I wrote the book to demonstrate that we're interconnected as humans, and in making the choice to heal ourselves we can heal each other and uplift society,\" she told Annals. It's a \"riveting, heartbreaking, sometimes difficult, always inspiring story,\" according to The New York Times Book Review, and \"a profoundly humane memoir from a thoughtful doctor,\" according to Kirkus Reviews.
