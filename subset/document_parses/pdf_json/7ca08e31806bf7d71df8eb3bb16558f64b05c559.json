This study aims to evaluate the role of oral probiotic Bifidobacterium on moderate/severe SARS-CoV-2 inpatients. In this single-center study, we analyzed data of 44 moderate/severe inpatients with diagnosed COVID-19 in Istanbul Maltepe University Medical Faculty Hospital, 2020 from 1 November 2020 to 15 December 2020. Clinical and medication features were compared and analyzed between patients with or without probiotic. In result, 19 of the 44 patients (43.18%) who were administrated with oral booster-single strain probiotic were discharged with the median inpatient day of 7.6 days which were significantly shorter than those of patients without probiotic. There were significant differences in inpatient days, radiological improvement at day 6 and week 3, and reduction in interleukin-6 levels in those receiving oral probiotic therapy. Although the mortality rate was 5% in the probiotic group, it was 25% in the non-probiotic group. Booster-single strain probiotic bifidobacteria could be an effective treatment strategy for moderate/severe SARS-CoV-2 inpatients to reduce the mortality and length of stay in hospital.",

            "text": "SARS-CoV-2 is a pandemic virus that exists itself with lung disease as well as leading to symptoms and signs associated with the gastrointestinal tract. It is especially manifested by the disturbed immune status in lung and intestinal tissues. Although the pathophysiology of the SARS-CoV-2 in lung and gut remains to be defined, it is evident that its pathological impacts include both direct effects of viral invasion and a complex immunological response. 1 Increased endoplasmic reticulum stress and cellular autophagy, which play key roles for the cellular replication of the virus, are mediated by the enhanced adaptive Th17/IL-6 immune system and this leads to an uncontrolled immune response. 2 Currently, there are no proven medical treatment developed for this uncontrolled immune response. Anti-inflammatory agents (corticosteroids), anticoagulation agents (enoxaparin), Favipiravir (antiviral treatment), and specific immune treatment (Anti-Il-6, anti-Il-1, and Immune plasma) are considered for the medical therapy of moderate/severe SARS-CoV-2 inpatients in the Turkish Health of Ministry guidelines for COVID-19. 3 Probiotics are living microorganisms that have been shown to have modulatory effects on adaptive immunity. The beneficial immune modulation effects of some single strain probiotic bacteria have been shown. 4 The pathogenesis of the immune response to coronavirus bears a strong resemblance with TH17-Th1driven autoimmune diseases and these TH17-Th1 immune interactions appear to play an important role in virus replication. The immune beneficial effects of bifidobacteria strains include an anti-IL-17 effect which could play important role in SARS-CoV-2 treatment. 2 Bifidobacterium animalis sp. Lactis provides to rapid mucosal healing in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and this effect was related to the IL-17 inhibitory effect of the Bifidobacterium animalis sp. Lactis strain. 2, 4 Cytokine storm can be controlled through these immune modulating effects of probiotic bifidobacteria. In a current analysis, it has been shown that reduced Bifidobacterium abundance is likely associated with increased SARS-CoV-2 infection severity, 5 so Bifidobacterium and other probiotic supplementation or refloralization via booster Bifidobacterium administration might provide a therapeutic benefit, particularly for patients hospitalized with severe disease. Here, we offer a new approach with booster dose oral single strain probiotic Bifidobacterium administration in moderate/severe SARS-CoV-2 patients.",

In a report, viral replication could be decreased by blocking the inositolrequiring enzyme one in SARS-CoV patients with bronchitis. 10 Also, Kong et al. 11 showed that IL-6 induces autophagy via the IRE1. Interleukin-17 is a proinflammatory cytokine that reveals an important role in the adaptive immune system. IL-17 (originating mainly from Th17) is also a strong cytokine by increasing of ER stress and autophagy via IRE1. 4 Besides these, IL-17 plays a potent inducer of chronic inflammation in IBD. 4 Hou et al. 12 reported that the increasing of IL-6 stimulates the production of Th17 cells and that IL-6 and IL-17 association promotes the viral replication and this synergistically communication could be important therapeutic strategy for SARS-CoV therapies. Increased IL-6 levels were reported in patients with SARS and were correlated with disease severity. 13 Zhou et al. 14 showed that IL-6 levels were correlated with mortality in patients with SARS-CoV-2. The over expression of IL-6 might explain the excessive activated Th17/Il-17 cells observed in SARS-CoV-2 patients. 15 Grifoni et al. 16 cited that blood IL-6 level at hospital admission might be considered as a predictive factor for the combined endpoint progression to moderate/ severe disease and/or in-hospital mortality, and it seems to be the best prognostic factor for negative outcome. Although cytokine storm occurred due to the uncontrolled adaptive immune response that occurs during the virus cell invasion and cellular replication, treatment responses could not be shown with specific anti-interleukin treatments. Rosas et al. showed that there is no effect of anti-interleukin six treatment on mortality and morbidity in SARS-CoV-2 patients. 17 Also, Cavalli et al. presented that interleukin-1 inhibition has no effect on disease mortality and morbidity. 18 There are currently limited scientific studies with probiotics in SARS-CoV-2. Li et al. reported that oral probiotics might be an effective therapeutic approach for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 patients to reduce the secondary infection and modulated the adaptive immunity. 19 In accordance to Santacroce et al. 20 Lactis BB-12 does not belong to the human gut microbiota system. However, BB-12 strain has been reported to be effective and safe for human intestinal microbiota. 21 Also, BB-12 strain shows strong growth ability under gastric pH and bile acid conditions. 22 Larsen et al showed that the dysbiosis recovery of BB-12 increased significantly with increasing dose. 23 According to them, up to 10 12 CFU of Bifidobacterium BB-12 can be considered as a booster dose. Some of single strain probiotic bifidobacteria such as 24 cited that Lactobacillus casei and Bifidobacterium lactis probiotics have anti-viral activity against the respiratory viral diseases. Although it has been shown that probiotics containing multiple species taken from the mouth reduce the severity of the infection, 20 the cause and effect relationship cannot be clearly revealed due to the various of probiotic bacterial species, at this point, the high dose single strain of probiotic bifidobacteria approach maybe more suitable method. However, our study group was small and our initial results must further be supported by large randomized studies. There is also a need for more comprehensive analytic calculation studies by confirming gut microbial analysis methods in those with dysbiosis in large t randomized studies ",
