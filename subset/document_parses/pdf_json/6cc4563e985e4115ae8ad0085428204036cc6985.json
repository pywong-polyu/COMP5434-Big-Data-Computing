Method. Here we examined, for the first time, FC between the aINS and the whole brain in a sample of full-term, postmenstrual age (PMA) matched neonates (mean 44.0 weeks, SD=1.5) who due to family history have high likelihood (HL) for developing autism (n=12) and in controls (n=41) without family history of autism (low likelihood, LL). Behaviors associated with autism were evaluated between 12 and 18 months (M=17.3 months, SD=2.5) in a subsample (25/53) of participants using the First Year Inventory (FYI).",

Lower connectivity between the two nodes was associated with higher FYI risk scores in the social domain (r(25) = -.561, p=.003) and this association remained robust when maternal mental health factors were considered. Considering that a subsample of LL participants (n=14/41) underwent brain imaging during the fetal period at PMA 31 and 34 weeks, in an exploratory analysis, we evaluated prospectively development of the LaINS-Lamy connectivity and found that the two areas strongly coactivate throughout the third trimester of pregnancy. Conclusions. The study identifies left lateralized anterior insula -amygdala connectivity as a potential target of further investigation into neural circuitry that enhances likelihood of future onset of social behaviors associated with autism during neonatal and potentially prenatal periods.",

            "text": "Autism spectrum disorder (referred to henceforth as 'autism') is an early-onset neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by atypical social interaction patterns and presence of restrictive interests and repetitive behaviors. 1 Genetic factors involved in the etiology of autism are thought to affect development of structural and functional brain networks, which in turn contribute to the development of behaviors constituting core autism symptoms. A functional network heavily implicated in autism is the salience network, consisting of anterior insula (aINS) and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). [2] [3] [4] [5] The aINS is a major afferent hub that receives extensive viscero-autonomic feedback, while the ACC functions as an efferent hub responsible for generating relevant visceral, autonomic, behavioral, and cognitive responses. 6, 7 The salience network links other cortical networks with limbic and autonomic systems, and is involved in detection of and orienting to salient external and internal stimuli, including those that are social in nature. 7 There is extensive evidence based on studies with preschoolers, school-age children, and adolescents with autism of reduced communication between aINS and other cortical nodes including those comprising the default mode (DMN) and the frontoparietal (FPN) networks, as well as the amygdala. 4, [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] This reduced functional connectivity (FC) may result in difficulties in transfer and integration of information across these networks, which then could contribute to the impaired processing of social signals in autism. However, given that autism onsets in early childhood and that most FC studies are conducted in older children, it is not clear to what extent the observed differences precede emergence of symptoms of autism or emerge secondary to the way children with autism experience and interact with their social and nonsocial environment.",

Younger siblings of children with autism, who due to genetic factors have a higher likelihood (HL) for developing autism than the general population, show alterations of FC patterns during the first two post-natal months. These alterations include increased regional homogeneity (ReHo) in the fusiform gyrus and parietal cortex nodes, 21 increased within-network connectivity in the DMN, 22 and decreased connectivity between right aINS and ACC and other higher order cortical regions compared to neonates without genetic risk factors for autism (i.e., low likelihood (LL) for developing autism). 23 Here, we examined differences in the aINS seed-based FC in HL and LL neonates. Based on prior work with older children with autism, we hypothesized that HL neonates would exhibit reduced aINS connectivity with other cortical areas compared to the LL controls. We further hypothesized that the reduced aINS connectivity would be associated with elevated risk scores for autism-related behaviors measured later in infancy. Considering reports regarding links between maternal mental health and developing connectome, [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] as well as infant social and emotional development, [31] [32] [33] indices of maternal stress, anxiety, and depression were controlled for in the analyses.",

Of note, the observed effects are independent of maternal stress, anxiety, and depressive symptoms, which are known to affect development of the amygdala circuitry 24-30 as well as social and emotional outcomes in infancy. [31] [32] [33] The study demonstrates that genetic predisposition for autism manifests in decreased communication between early maturing cortical nodes involved in salience detection.

At birth, the amygdala shows adult-like positive connectivity with subcortical nodes including the thalamus, caudate, and putamen, which together play a role in bottom-up emotional appraisal. 58 The presence of such adult-like subcortical synchronization at birth suggests that the network is evolutionarily optimized to ensure early survival. 19 Connectivity between the amygdala and the cortical salience network nodes develops over the first year of life and is characterized by an increase in connectivity over time, with infants reaching adult-level connectivity by 12 months. 19 Our work tracing the development of anterior insula -amygdala connectivity from fetal to neonatal periods suggests that the two nodes show positive coactivation already at 31 weeks PMA with no major changes during the fetal to neonatal transition. Therefore, the insula-amygdala connection may represent an early-maturing experience-expectant functional infrastructure that prepares newborns to select, evaluate, and integrate sensory information and to learn and adapt to their environment. Given the early interconnectedness between these major cortical hubs and their support of information integration that forms the foundation for numerous complex cognitive functions, their perturbation may have long ranging developmental consequences.",

A recent model of social development proposes that newborns learn to associate interoceptive signals related to their allostatic needs (hunger, temperature, pain) with exteroceptive signals related to caretaker actions aimed at regulation of the newborn's allostasis (feeding, warming, soothing) into a multimodal experience. 20 The inability of newborns to maintain their own allostasis primes them to learn rapidly what does maintain it, which, in the case of human babies, are parents or caregivers. The learning process through which babies come to associate their allostatic regulation with a caregiver provides a foundation for social motivation. Importantly, neural systems that support social behaviors overlap with neural systems supporting allostasis, including insula and amygdala circuitry. Alterations in communication between the two key nodes may contribute to weakening the very mechanism that supports development of social engagement and motivation. Consistent with this view, our findings show significant links between attenuated anterior insula -amygdala connectivity and later social-communication vulnerabilities.",

Further, considering multifactorial contribution to the developing connectome and behavioral outcomes in infancy, accounting for maternal mental health status in all analytic models represents another important area of strength. While differences in FC indices between HL and LL neonates have been reported previously, lack of phenotypic follow-up data has limited interpretation of some of the findings. Here we demonstrate, for the first time, that insula -amygdala hypoconnectivity is linked to the presence of social communication vulnerability in the second year of life. Unique to this study is an inclusion of a fetal sample and our ability to demonstrate using a prospective longitudinal design that the insula and amygdala coactivate already at 31 weeks, providing functional infrastructure for the experience-dependent postnatal development. Interpretation of the findings may be limited by the small HL sample size and a relatively small proportion of participants with 2-year diagnostic outcomes. Larger samples may enable us better to address the question of sex-linked FC effects in infants with familial history of autism, and to detect other alterations in resting state functional connectivity in neonates, contributing to a more complete picture of the impact of genetic predispositions toward autism on early brain development. It will be crucial to replicate the findings in a larger cohort and to extend it into the first months of life to track developmental dynamics of the observed brain-based vulnerabilities and their contribution to behavioral outcomes in infants with familial history of autism.",

            "text": "). All neonates have been participating in an ongoing prospective longitudinal study and their social development is assessed periodically in the second year of life, with diagnostic outcome measures expected to be completed at the age of 24 months. At 24 months, the participants undergo a clinical evaluation using the Mullen Scales of Early Learning (MSEL) capturing verbal and nonverbal developmental skills, the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule, Second Edition (ADOS-2) Toddler Module quantifying symptoms of autism, and the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales, Third Edition (VABS-3) capturing adaptive skill level. Due to genetic liability, approximately 20% of HL participants are expected to develop autism, whereas another 30-40% are expected to demonstrate delays and atypical features often referred to as broader autism phenotype (BAP) by the time they reach 2 years of age. 34-36 Maternal mental health. Maternal perinatal mental health was quantified using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), 37 a 10-item measure of perinatal depression yielding possible scores ranging from 0 to 30; the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), 38 a 40-item measure of both state and trait anxiety total scores each ranging from 20 to 80; and the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-14), 39 a 14-item measure of perceived stress with scores ranging from 0 to 56. For all three measures, higher scores indicate the presence of more symptoms. Autism-related social and regulatory behaviors. Behaviors considered risk factors for autism were assessed using the First Year Inventory 2.0 (FYI) parent questionnaire. 40,41 The FYI measure is sensitive to autism-specific behaviors in the general population and amongst younger siblings of children with autism 42-46 and shows positive correlations with concurrent direct measures of autism symptom severity captured by the ADOS-2 Toddler Module 47 and the Autism Observation Scale for Infants (AOSI).",

In an exploratory analysis, we examined longitudinal changes in aINS -amygdala connectivity between 31-and 44-weeks PMA in LL participants using linear mixed effects model. The model included random effects to account for multiple longitudinal measurements from the same individual, incorporated nonlinearity by allowing the slope to change at 35 weeks and allowed for heteroscedasticity by using different error variance parameters to describe the first and second fetal measurements (denoted by F1 and F2) and the neonatal measurement (denoted by NN).",

Given that altered amygdala circuitry in infants is a common sequela of experiencing prenatal maternal distress, 24-30 we repeated our primary analyses controlling for maternal scores on the EPDS, STAI, and PSS questionnaires. The ANOVA effects remained significant when controlling for the three maternal mental health variables: group: F(1, 46) = 6.23, p=.016), sex: F(1, 46) = 3.57, p=.065. group x sex: F (1, 46) = 4.30, p=.044, with negligible effects of maternal depression (p=.522), trait anxiety (p=.521), and stress (p=.851). Associations between functional connectivity and phenotypic features. Subsequently, we computed Pearson's r correlation between the FYI scores and the left aINS -left amygdala connectivity in the combined neurodiverse sample. The correlation indicated that lower connectivity between left aINS and left amygdala was associated with higher later FYI scores, r(25) = -.561, p=.004 in the Social Communication but not in the Sensory and Regulatory domain, r (25) = -.302, p=.142 (Figure 3). The association between aINS -amygdala connectivity and FYI Social communication scores remained robust when maternal EPDS, STAI, and PSS scores were partialled out, r(25) = .-526, p=.012. Development of insula-amygdala edge from fetal to neonatal period in LL only. Finally, we investigated the normative fetal-to-neonatal developmental trajectory of the left aINS -left amygdala connectivity in the LL sample. The data are shown in Figure 4, along with the 95% confidence intervals for the mean connectivity at each of the 3 representative ages of 31-, 35-, and 44-weeks PMA. This analysis indicated that connectivity between the two nodes is already greater than 0 at 31 weeks of gestation and does not undergo marked increases or decreases during the prenatal to neonatal transition. Specifically, at each age, the connectivity on this edge was found to be significantly positive, with a mean of .148 at 31 weeks PMA (t(30)=4.90, p<.0001), .136 at 35 weeks (t(30)=5.64, p<.0001), and .122 at 44 weeks (t(30)=9.93, p < .0001) and the linear mixed effects model indicated no effects of PMA, with no significant slope before 35 weeks PMA (mean = -.003/week, p=0.77) and no significant increase in slope at 35 weeks PMA (mean = .0014/week, p=.91).",
