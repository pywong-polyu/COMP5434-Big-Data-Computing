The present study aims to investigate: 1) whether individuals exhibit optimistic bias in the context of COVID-19 pandemic; 2) and whether age and culture would moderate such bias. Method. 1051 participants recruited from China, Israel and the US took the online survey. Risk perceptions consists of three questions: estimating the infected probability of different social distance groups (i.e., self, close others, and non-close others), the days that it would take for the number of new infections to decrease to zero and the trend of infections in regions of different geographical distances (i.e., local place, other places inside participants\" country and other countries).

Empirical studies have suggested that optimistic bias can be one of the emotion regulation strategies through which people can develop and maintain positive beliefs about themselves (Bavel et al., 2020; Shepperd, Waters, Weinstein, & Klein, 2015) .

Accumulating evidence showed that older adults tended to avoid negative emotions to a larger A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t extent compared with younger adults (Isaacowitz, Toner, Goren, & Wilson, 2008; Urry & Gross, 2010) . As such, people who are relatively older may regulate their negative emotions by introducing a higher level of optimistic bias in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, there are only limited empirical studies investigating the association between optimistic bias and age under pandemic. To the best of our knowledge, one study conducted in the early outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic provided initial support that the optimistic bias might increase with age: Compared to younger adults, older adults thought that other people had higher chances to get infected with COVID-19 than themselves (Druica et al., 2020) .",

For example, studies found that older adults exhibit more obvious in-group favoritism to achieve their goal of maintaining socioemotional satisfaction, compared with younger adults (Cassidy, Hughes, Lanie & Krendl, 2020; Li & Fung, 2013) .

The second purpose of the present study is to examine age differences in optimistic bias in the face of the COVID-19 across cultures. Following up on the postulate of the socioemotional selectivity theory (Carstensen, 2006 ) that individuals increasingly prioritize emotionally meaningful goals as they age, Fung (2013) argues that what is considered emotionally meaningful could differ across cultures. This model, known as \"Aging in Culture,\" suggests that cultural differences in aging may occur if 1) different cultures consider different goals as emotionally meaningful, and 2) with age, individuals in different cultures each pursue the goals they consider to be emotionally meaningful. This model has been confirmed in domains such as age differences in social network composition (Fung, Carstensen, & Lang, 2001) , personality (Fung, Ho, Tam, Tsai, & Zhang, 2011) and social cognition (Fung, Isaacowitz, Lu, & Li, 2010) .",

It remains unclear whether such cultural differences in optimistic bias A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t would be influenced by age. There is evidence suggesting that optimistic bias is highly associated with in-group favoritism (Chen, Brockner, & Chen, 2002; Wann & Grieve, 2005) , with both emphasizing more positive evaluation of self/close others relative to less close others. Like cultural differences in optimistic bias, studies showed that in-group favoritism was emphasized more in collectivistic cultures such as China than in individualistic cultures such as the US (Huang & Rau, 2019; van Hoorn, 2015) . Specifically, in societies with higher collectivistic values, because people are closely tied within relatively small communities (e.g., family) or cooperation partnerships, they have a higher preference for people inside their own social groups than more socially distant others (Li & Fung, 2013) . Moreover, this cultural value prioritizing small close communities over socially distant groups (i.e.",

As the COVID-19 pandemic is still on-going, our real-life experiences of risks and uncertainties during the pandemic are ubiquitous. The present study sampled participants from China, Israel and the US (to represent a continuum of the individualism-collectivism dimension) to investigate the optimistic bias in individuals\" risk perception of COVID-19 and further explore how two moderators (i.e., age and culture) could moderate the level of the optimistic bias. Understanding variations of the optimistic bias across age and culture is essential for developing prevention strategies, which could help potential at-risk groups (i.e., older adults, see Ayalon, et al., 2020) to improve their physical health and well-being during the pandemic.",

We also hypothesized that the above moderation of culture would be driven by differential endorsement of communal values across cultures such that personal endorsement of communal values would moderate age differences in optimistic bias in the same way as culture would. Ideally, the best way to test whether the above cultural differences, if observed, are driven by differential emphasis on particular values in the respective cultures is a mediated moderation model that directly examines whether cultural differences in age-related optimistic bias are mediated by cultural differences in values. However, our study only sampled from one-time point and cross-sectional mediation analysis has been much criticized in the literature (Deboeck & Preacher, 2016; Maxwell & Cole, 2007) . Hence, we employed a second-best approach by conducting a follow-up analysis to examine if personal endorsement of communal values (values that are positively associated with collectivism) moderates age differences in optimistic bias in the same way as culture does.",

For the first set of HLM A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t analyses, the dependent variables (DVs) were probability, days and trend. The within-person (level-1) predictor was distance (either social distance for probability estimation or geographical distance for the rest of the DVs). The between-person (level-2) predictors included culture, chronological age, marital status, self-reported health, sex, self-reported socioeconomic status (SES) and all the control variables mentioned above. Considering that culture was a categorical variable, two dummy variables culture 1 (1 = Chinese, 0 = non-Chinese) and culture 2 (1 = Israel, 0 = non-Israel) were generated to represent different cultures. The equation for the model was shown below. In addition, we added another set of analyses to examine whether personal communal values would moderate age differences in optimistic bias. We expected personal communal values at the individual level to moderate age differences in optimistic bias in the same way as the cultural differences observed in the main analysis. For such analyses, the dependent variables (DVs) and the within-person (level-1) predictors were the same as the first part, we only replaced the culture variable with personal communal values at level 2.",

            "text": "Despite these limitations, the present study is the first to comprehensively investigate the interactive effects across age and cultural contexts on the optimistic bias during the COVID-19 outbreak. This provides evidence to support the \"Aging in Culture\" model (Fung, 2013) . Moreover, the present study might have practical implications in terms of prevention strategies in different cultures. On the one hand, we may need to raise public awareness, particularly among groups with high optimistic bias, as the optimistic bias would reduce behavioral intentions for health behaviors (Park & Ju, 2016) and self-protection behaviors in the context of disasters (Trumbo et al., 2011) . On the other hand, there is accumulating evidence suggesting that the COVID-19 pandemic has caused a large amount of public fear, which can M a n u s c r i p t lead to mental health problems, with potential also for increased suicidality (Gavin, Lyne, & McNicholas, 2020; Hansel, Saltzman, & Bordnick, 2020) . We might need to develop age-friendly measures to help groups with low optimistic bias, such as older adults in the US and Israel, to manage their pandemic-induced anxiety.

The results suggest that, generally people believe that non-close others are more likely to be infected than themselves/close others; and compared with their local place and other places inside their country, other places are more likely to defeat the outbreak in a more distant future, and the number of infections is more likely to go up in other places.
