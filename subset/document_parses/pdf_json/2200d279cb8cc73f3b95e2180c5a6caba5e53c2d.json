Based on health psychology theory set out in a logic model, respiratory health professionals were recruited and trained to deliver a cognitive behavioural approach intervention (The TANDEM intervention) under the supervision of senior cognitive behavioural practitioners. Here, we describe the protocol for the process evaluation commissioned alongside the trial. A realist approach that includes attention to describing contexts and mechanisms has been adopted.",

            "text": "We set up a multi-disciplinary team to develop and deliver the process evaluation. The mixed-methods design incorporates quantitative process data; monitoring of intervention fidelity; qualitative interviews with patients, carers, health professionals (facilitators) and clinical supervisors about their perspectives on acceptability of the intervention; and exploration with all stakeholders (including management/policy-makers) on future implementation. Normalisation process theory (NPT) will inform data collection and interpretation with a focus on implementation. Quantitative process data will be analysed descriptively. Qualitative interview data will be analysed before the trial outcomes are known using analytic induction and constant comparison to develop themes. Findings from the different elements will be reported separately and then integrated. Conclusion: Detailed description and analysis of study processes in a research trial such as TANDEM enables research teams to describe study contexts and mechanisms and to examine the relationship with outcomes. In this way, learning from the trial goes beyond the randomised control trial (RCT) model where effectiveness is prioritised and makes it possible to explore issues arising for post-trial study implementation.",

            "text": "Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a complex long-term condition (LTC) associated with considerable morbidity and mortality. It has a global prevalence of 11.7% in adults aged over 30 years [1] . It is considered to be a neglected disease [2] despite being the third leading cause of death worldwide, the fifth biggest cause of death in the UK [3] , and the ninth cause of disability-adjusted life years [4] . Pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) is an effective therapeutic approach for people with COPD [5, 6] . However, both referrals from health professionals and attendance at PR courses by patients are sub-optimal [7] . COPD often co-exists with other LTCs, including anxiety (10-50%) [8, 9] , and depression (30%) [8] , which affect hospital admissions, quality of life and self-efficacy [10, 11] . The evidence for optimal approaches to managing psychological comorbidities in COPD is not conclusive, and there are few evidencebased care pathways for anxiety and depression in people with COPD [12] . Psychological therapies such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) are proposed as potential treatments for patients living with LTCs such as COPD with co-morbid anxiety and/or depression [13] [14] [15] . Research suggests that the beneficial effects of psychological treatment for anxiety and depression on its own in COPD are limited and therefore studies have reported linking psychological treatment with physical activity, lifestyle and selfmanagement support interventions to improve patient outcomes [16] . Despite much discussion about the need to provide patient-centred care for people with LTCs that integrates mental and physical health, health professionals often find addressing psychological aspects challenging [17, 18] . This paper presents the protocol for a process evaluation being undertaken in parallel to a trial evaluating a tailored intervention using a cognitive behavioural approach (CBA) incorporating self-management skills which precedes, links with, and optimises the benefits of currently offered PR, in patients with COPD and depression and/or anxiety. The intervention incorporates training and supervision of respiratory healthcare professionals to deliver five to eight individual CBA sessions to patients whilst awaiting PR. The multi-centre, pragmatic, randomised controlled trial (RCT), including an internal pilot, will assess whether receiving the intervention (TANDEM) prior to routine PR improves anxiety and/or depression in people with moderate to very severe COPD (GOLD criteria [19] ) and mild to moderate anxiety and/or depression. The trial will also assess if the intervention improves attendance and completion of PR. A parallel economic evaluation will be undertaken. The main trial protocol has been published [20] .",

The multi-level intervention integrates both CBA training of health professionals and their delivery of CBA to patients. We have developed an intervention logic model [22] which maps out a causal chain for the problem under investigation and identifies the intervention mechanisms, which aspects will be changed, and how (see Fig. 1 ). The model uses an intervention based on Beck's cognitive behaviour therapy model for managing anxiety and depression [23] , as well as self-management training informed by Bandura's social cognitive theory [24, 25] , and Leventhal's self-regulation theory [26] . The logic model is based on the premise that the way in which individuals with COPD think about their illness has an influence on how they behave and feel. Change targeted at cognitive, behavioural or symptom level will improve emotional outcomes and self-management making it more likely that people will attend PR [27] .",

We describe this as a cognitive behavioural approach (CBA) intervention [27] . TANDEM facilitators deliver five to eight (with nine maximum weekly CBA sessions to allow for a missed session, e.g. due to illness), each lasting 40-60 min, in a location preferred by the patient, and if the patient decides to attend PR the facilitators provide further telephone support sessions before starting PR and continuing to two weeks following completion of PR. Facilitators receive telephone clinical supervision by a trained cognitive behavioural practitioner. Patients (and their carers) have been recruited from 12 participating National Health Service (NHS) Trusts partnered with five NHS Clinical Commissioning Groups (CCGs). Facilitators have been recruited among the participating study sites and from neighbouring NHS organisations across England.",

Realist evaluation is an evaluation framework that attends to what it is about an intervention that works, for whom it works, and in what circumstances. It examines phenomena in relation to how context, mechanism and outcome are configured as patterns [34] . All Interventions are underpinned by theoretical assumptions about change and this may involve more than one theory, especially in complex interventions. We held a workshop to discuss and agree conceptual models, creating a multi-dimensional framework that aims to make the different elements visible in order to maximise the field of vision in terms of breadth and depth, in turn enabling fuller engagement with the complex systems in which complex interventions are undertaken [36] .

It is also not possible to separate the facilitators' experiences of delivering the intervention from the contexts in which they work including their professional identity. We need therefore to describe contexts, how contexts influence system change and how the intervention modifies the context. Potentially salient contextual influences on effectiveness and implementation that we have identified for the TANDEM trial are as follows: facilitators' professional practice; facilitator training; patient-facilitator relationship; facilitator supervision; patient (and carer where relevant) complex lives, policy-level priorities and organisational stakeholders' perspectives on the delivery context.

Complex interventions usually undergo some tailoring/adaptation when delivered in different contexts. Capturing what is delivered in practice with reference to the theory of the intervention can enable evaluators to understand the core elements and where more flexibility may be allowed. Analysis focuses on what was delivered and how it was delivered, including training and support, communication and logistics, and how these structures interact with the implementer facilitators' attitudes and circumstances to shape the intervention.",
