In this article, a modified version of the well known mathematical epidemic model Susceptible (S)-Infected (I)-Recovered (R) is used to analyze the epidemic's course of COVID-19 in eight different countries of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC). To achieve this goal, the parameters of the SIR model are identified by using publicly available data for the corresponding countries: Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, the Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. Based on the prediction model we estimated the epidemic trend of COVID-19 outbreak in SAARC countries for 20 days, 90 days, and 180 days respectively. An SML (short-mid-long) term prediction model has been designed to understand the early dynamics of COVID-19 Epidemic in the south-east Asian region. The maximum and minimum basic reproduction number (R 0 = 1.33 and 1.07) for SAARC countries are predicted to be in Pakistan and Bhutan. We equate simulation results with real data in the SAARC countries on the COVID-19 outbreak, and model potential countermeasure implementation scenarios.

Our study focuses on the COVID-19 case prediction using a modified SIR model (M-SIR) in the countries of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC). SAARC is considered as an intergovernmental organization and geopolitical union of states in South Asia.

Our aim is to develop a prediction model for the SAARC countries to understand the epidemiological trend of novel coronavirus outbreak in these countries.

The SIR model based on three sections: Susceptible (S) is the class for those who are susceptible to infection. This can include passive immune systems as soon as they lose their immunity. In the Infected (I) class, the parasite level within the host is large enough, and there is a possibility of spreading the infection to other susceptible people. The Recovered (R) class includes all infected and recovered individuals. This epidemiological model captures the dynamics of acute infections that, after recovery, confer lifelong immunity. In general, the overall size of the population is considered constant N=S+I+R. The two cases should be examined and characterized by the inclusion or exclusion of demographic factors.
