Series reporting neurological manifestations of COVID-19 patients were studied. Results 39 studies and 68,361 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients were included. Up to 21.3% of COVID-19 patients presented neurological symptoms. Headache (5.4%), skeletal muscle injury (5.1%), psychiatric disorders (4.6%), impaired consciousness (2.8%), gustatory/olfactory dysfunction (2.3%), acute cerebrovascular events (1.4%), and dizziness (1.3%), were the most frequently reported neurological manifestations. Ischemic stroke occurred among 1.3% of COVID-19 patients. Other less common neurological manifestations were cranial nerve impairment (0.6%), nerve root and plexus disorders (0.4%), epilepsy (0.7%), and hemorrhagic stroke (0.15%). Impaired consciousness and acute cerebrovascular events were reported in 14% and 4% of patients with a severe disease, respectively, and they were significantly higher compared to non-severe patients (p < 0.05). Individual patient data from 129 COVID-19 patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS) were extracted: mean age was 64.4 (SD \u00b1 6.2), 78.5% had anterior circulation occlusions, the mean NIHSS was 15 (SD \u00b1 7), and the intra-hospital mortality rate was 22.8%. Admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) was required among 63% of patients. Conclusion This updated review of literature, shows that headache, skeletal muscle injury, psychiatric disorders, impaired consciousness, and gustatory/olfactory dysfunction were the most common neurological symptoms of COVID-19 patients. Impaired consciousness and acute cerebrovascular events were significantly higher among patients with a severe infection. AIS patients required ICU admission in 63% of cases, while intra-hospital mortality rate was close to 23%.",

A very recent study of Spanish COVID-19 patients underlined a frequency of smell and taste disorders close to 40% [29] . According to these data, the frequency of otolaryngologic dysfunction seems to be substantially higher in European COVID-19 patients, compared to the Asian ones, but this difference needs to be investigated. Indeed, some hypotheses can be raised: either in Asian studies, the otolaryngologic complaints were not fully assessed, or the Chinese patients had a different tissue sensibility to the virus. Indeed, mutations of surface proteins (responsible for virus entry into the cell) [30] and polymorphisms of the ACE2 receptors [31] (that could be specific to certain populations) may influence susceptibility to develop certain symptoms [32] . Nevertheless, the pathophysiological mechanisms leading to the olfactory and gustatory dysfunctions are still unknown. Previous studies have shown the ability of SARS-CoV to determine neuronal death in mice by invading the brain via the olfactory epithelium [33] . Accordingly, the olfactory bulb may be a pathway of the transneuronal spread of the virus. Moreover, to date, there is no evidence that patients with anosmia or gustatory disfunction are at higher risk of a neuroinvasive SARS-CoV-2 infection [17] .",

Our review showed up to 0.6% and 0.4% of patients reporting nerve root and plexus dysfunctions, and cranial nerve impairment, respectively. Accordingly, some cases of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome have been reported associated with the SARS-CoV-2 virus [34, 35] . These cases, mostly occurring after some days or weeks after the infection, may be considered a consequence of the immune response to peripheral nerve antigens, resulting in demyelination and axonal injury. Although it should be established if COVID-19 is the trigger of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 disease and other peripheral nerve disorders occurring during the infection. Clinicians should be aware of the possible association between the coronavirus and these manifestations [34] [35] [36] .",

Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis has been reported in MERS-CoV [6] , and recently in SARS-CoV-2 [37] . Poyiadji et al. [37] described a case of acute necrotizing encephalopathy in a COVID-19 patient admitted with fever, cough and altered mental status. Another recent case has been published by Filatov et al. [38] , reporting a 74-year-old male with COVID-19 infection presenting with altered mental status and developing an acute encephalopathy. These cases may underline the importance of a comprehensive pathogen examination in case of encephalitis-or meningitis-related symptoms among COVID-19-infected patients. Most importantly, among studies comparing severe and non-severe SARS-CoV-2 patients, impaired consciousness was significantly higher in subjects with an unfavorable evolution of the disease. About 3% of patients showing a non-severe disease presented impaired consciousness, compared to 14% of those showing an aggressive disease.",

In fact, the dysfunction of endothelial cells induced by infection may promote an increased thrombin generation and fibrinolysis [43] ; moreover, the hypoxia found in severe COVID-19 patients can be a trigger for thrombosis, increasing blood viscosity, and inducing hypoxia-inducible transcription factors [44] . Indeed, it has been reported that ICU patients with severe respiratory disease requiring extracorporeal membrane oxygenation may experience higher rate of neurological complications, with about 13% of ischemic and hemorrhagic events, likely related to the loss of cerebral autoregulation and/or vasoconstriction following arterial pressure variation during extracorporeal membrane oxygenation [45] . According to these results, a recent study of histopathological changes of brain specimens obtained from 18 patients who died 0-32 days after the onset of symptoms of COVID-19 showed only hypoxic changes and did not show encephalitis or other specific brain changes referable to the virus [46] . In our analysis, 63% of AIS patients required ICU admission, while almost 23% experienced mortality during hospitalization. Higher levels of blood C-reactive protein, and higher d-dimer concentration [40] have be reported in SARS-CoV-2 patients with acute cerebrovascular disease, underlining a hypercoagulability state: for this reason, anticoagulant therapy has been suggested for patients presenting elevated d-dimer and fibrin degradation products [47, 48] , although the optimal management of COVID-19 patients with acute cerebrovascular events remain to be elucidated [13] .",
