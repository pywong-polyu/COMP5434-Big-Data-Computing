Sources: A PubMed search was conducted on 1 June 2020 based on a search strategy of (Ct value OR viral load) AND SARS-CoV-2. Data were extracted from studies reporting on the presence or absence of an association between Ct values, or viral loads determined via Ct value, and clinical outcomes. Content: Data from 18 studies were relevant for inclusion. One study reported on the correlation between Ct values and mortality and one study reported on the correlation between Ct values and progression to severe disease; both reported a significant association (p \\ 0.001 and p = 0.008, respectively). Fourteen studies reported on the correlation between Ct value or viral loads determined via Ct value and disease severity, and an association was observed in eight (57%) studies. Studies reporting on the correlation of viral load with biochemical and haematological markers showed an association with at least one marker, including increased lactate dehydrogenase (n = 4), decreased lymphocytes (n = 3) and increased high-sensitivity troponin I (n = 2). Two studies reporting on the correlation with infectivity showed that lower Ct values were associated with higher viral culture positivity. Implications: Data suggest that lower Ct values may be associated with worse outcomes and that Ct values may be useful in predicting the clinical course and prognosis of patients with Digital Features: To view digital features for this article go to https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.12668408.",

Real-time RT-PCR cycle threshold (Ct) values represent the number of amplification cycles required for the target gene to exceed a threshold level. Ct values are therefore inversely related to viral load and can provide an indirect method of quantifying the copy number of viral RNA in the sample; however, the use of Ct values as a proxy of viral load is influenced by the assay itself (correlation would stand in the linear dynamic range of the specific RT-PCR assay used) and factors within the sample matrix that can affect amplification efficiency [3] .",

One study in 12 patients showed that C-reactive protein levels negatively correlated with Ct value (r = -0.584; p = 0.03) [14] , whereas another in 25 patients showed no significant association (p = 0.07) [22] . Associations were also reported between Ct values and angiotensin II [14] , IL-2R [13] , basophil and eosinophil counts as well as levels of myoglobin, N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide, inorganic phosphorus and calcium [11] .",

Higher Ct values generally correlate with lower viral loads, although Ct value and log viral load may not be directly proportional because of the linear dynamic range of the assay and potential presence of inhibitory factors within clinical samples [28] . Fifteen (79%) of the studies included in this review investigated the direct association of Ct values with clinical outcomes rather than viral load itself, but it was assumed by authors that Ct values are an appropriate surrogate for viral load. Clinical knowledge of COVID-19 is constantly evolving, with studies being published at a high rate; however, there are currently only limited data relating to the correlation of viral loads with patient prognoses, such as mortality or disease progression. Only one study reported on the association between mortality and SARS-Cov-2 Ct value and showed that lower Ct values correlated with increased risk of death [11] , which is consistent with data for previous epidemic-causing coronaviruses [9, 29] . Given the wide range in disease course for COVID-19, the ability to predict which patients are at particularly high risk of deterioration and negative outcomes would be of particular value in the clinical setting; it would therefore be useful to continue to assess the value of SARS-CoV-2 Ct as further data become available.",

This is consistent with some previous studies of Ct values in other respiratory infections [29] [30] [31] , although other studies do not show correlation [32] . Whilst correlation between Ct value and disease severity was observed for 73% of studies in hospitalised patients, correlation between Ct or viral load determined via Ct value and disease severity was observed in none of the studies that included patients with COVID-19 who were not hospitalised. Studies in hospitalised patients are unlikely to include asymptomatic patients or those with very mild symptoms, but are likely to be more controlled, making correlations with Ct more probable. The role that symptoms play in viral shedding remains to be determined; in a large study of 5830 patients with COVID-19, which was prereview at the time that this review was conducted, viral load determined via Ct values in Table 1 continued Outcome Study nasal swabs of asymptomatic and symptomatic patients was not statistically different (median 4.7 log 10 copies/ml vs. 5.0 log 10 copies/ml; p = 0.51) [33] . Ct values were found to correlate with a number of clinical markers. Lower Ct values were associated with elevated LDH levels in all four studies in which it was assessed, which is consistent with reports that elevated LDH can act as an indicator of poor prognosis in patients with COVID-19 [34, 35] . Increased LDH reflects tissue destruction and in interstitial pulmonary fibrosis is seen as an important prognostic marker for lung injury [36] . Lower Ct values were associated with lower lymphocyte levels in all three studies in which they were assessed, which is consistent with reports that lymphopaenia could act as a predictor of higher disease severity in patients with COVID-19 [35, 37] . Similarly, correlation of Ct values was also seen with high-sensitivity troponin I, which has been suggested as a marker of COVID-19 disease progression and mortality [35] .",

The majority of the studies included in this review contained a relatively small number of patients; only four studies included [ 100 patients with COVID-19 [11, 15, 18, 24] . The viral load of SARS-CoV-2 is known to vary during the course of infection [10, 11, 13, 19, 20, [39] [40] [41] [42] . The time from onset of symptoms to sampling varied between studies and in most of the included studies, varied between patients. Time from onset of symptoms was included as an independent variable in only one of the analyses presented [27] and therefore this may be a confounding factor in many of the studies reported. The type of sample used varied between studies. Sample type is known to affect the Ct values and detected viral load [20, 40] , and therefore this may have affected results. The variability within and between the included studies is not consistent with previously reported considerations regarding variability around factors (sample type, workflow, assay) involved in robust viral load measurement using RT-PCR [3] . Reproducible experimental layouts to assess viral load from patient samples are key to establish any correlation to patient outcome.",
