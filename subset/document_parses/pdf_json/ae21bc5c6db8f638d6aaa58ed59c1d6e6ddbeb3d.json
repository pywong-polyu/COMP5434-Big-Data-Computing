Antibody levels varied between villages but showed consistent patterns with age and sex. Both IgG and IgM responses declined with increasing age.

            "text": "Female blackflies of the Simulium damnosum sensu lato (s.l.) complex are the predominant vectors of Onchocerca volvulus in Africa. This filarial nematode causes human onchocerciasis, commonly known as river blindness and proposed for elimination of transmission (EOT) in 12 countries by 2030 [1] . Repeat exposure to bites of infective blackflies is a key driver of parasite acquisition, and high biting rates are important determinants of transmission intensity and resurgence following control interventions, particularly those based on mass drug administration (MDA) of ivermectin [2, 3] . Therefore, 'stop-MDA surveys' and post-treatment surveillance protocols would be improved by monitoring exposure to vector bites in addition to exposure to the parasite and assessment of residual infection in informative age and sex groups depending on the epidemiological setting [4, 5] . Annual biting rates (ABR, the number of bites/person/year) are predominantly estimated by performing human landing catches (HLCs) [6] , but this is both labour-intensive and often considered unethical. Furthermore, HLC methods likely lead to biased estimates of ABRs as they are typically performed on a few adult males at the riverbank close to blackfly breeding sites, where biting rates are likely to be higher and vector collectors are maximally exposed [7] . Thus, HLCs may not capture the true exposure representative of the community, age or sex groups or their activity patterns. Furthermore, when blackfly densities are high, HLCs may be unable to capture all biting events thereby underestimating the biting rate [8, 9] . Applying novel methods to measure individual and population exposure to blackfly vector bites would greatly inform our understanding of exposure patterns to onchocerciasis and inform mathematical transmission modelling of control and elimination [2] .",

With the risk of residual transmission leading to possible resurgence of human infections if MDA were to stop [3] , the area has been the subject of comprehensive entomological [27, [29] [30] [31] , parasitological [32] and parasite genomic [33] research, and a source of valuable epidemiological and entomological data for parameterizing onchocerciasis transmission models [34] [35] [36] . Due to the lack of reliable tools to independently measure human exposure to vector bites, mathematical models have assumed age-and sex-dependent exposure rates based on patterns of human infection with O. volvulus. However, modelling outputs used to inform EOT and surveillance strategies are sensitive to such patterns [4, 37] . The aim of this study is to apply our novel human IgG and IgM immunoassays as indicators of individual biting exposure, both between and within (by age and sex) onchocerciasis-endemic communities. The generated demographic patterns will help to scrutinize mathematical modelling assumptions.",

Fig 1 provides a map of the study area and the location of the study communities, created using the 'ggplot2' and the 'rworldmap' package in R software [40, 41] . The shapefiles for the base layers of the map were retrieved from the Database of Global Administrative Areas (GADM, https://gadm.org/download_country.html) and from DIVA-GIS (http://www.divagis.org) under a CC BY license, with permission from GADM and DIVA-GIS. To obtain blood samples from the village residents, two recruitment approaches were adopted: in villages with <300 residents (ASU/SEN, FAW, and OHI) all residents were invited to participate. In the larger village (BEP) an age/sex stratified sample was identified based on assigning random numbers generated using R software [44] , to the pages of the paper-based census records compiled by the MDA programme. The households contained on randomly selected pages were noted and invited to participate until reaching an estimated sample of houses containing 250 individuals as required from statistical calculations (i.e.~1000 individuals in total across the four village clusters). Children younger than 4 years old were not recruited. A total of 958 participants were finally recruited, all tested for IgG antibodies, and a subset of 500 individuals tested for IgM antibodies (Table 1) . For age stratification purposes, the identified populations in all villages were divided into eight age categories (in years): 5-10, 11-20, 21-30, 31-40, 41-50, 51-60, 61-70, > 71, aiming to recruit 32 residents per age class in each village, split equally between the sexes. In the case of IgM, samples were selected by random number generation assigned to the ordered age-stratified full list of samples and aimed to test around 40-60% of the samples tested by IgG per age class, with some variability in percentage tested in the oldest age group. The numbers tested per age and sex strata per village cluster are shown in Figs A and B and Table C in S1 File. The geographical coordinates, elevation and number of individuals sampled and tested for each immunoglobulin per village cluster are shown in Table 1 .",

Univariate analyses of demographic variables detected significant differences between the median IgG responses among village clusters (P<0.001) (Fig 2A) , and the median IgG responses of males and females (P<0.05) (Fig 2B) . Equivalent differences were not observed in IgM responses (Fig 3) ; however, both IgG and IgM median antibody responses declined with age (P<0.001) (Figs 2D and 3D) . A breakdown of the IgG and IgM antibody distribution with age per individual cluster is visualized in Figs D and E in S1 File.",

Simuliids are important disease vectors of human and bovine onchocerciasis [49] , mansonelliasis caused by Mansonella ozzardi [50] , and vesicular stomatitis virus [51] , yet they have not received as much attention as sand fly, mosquito or tick vectors. Only recently, we successfully developed novel immunoassays against blackfly saliva and this is the first study to apply these tools to an epidemiological setting. The appropriate use of these assays will also improve our understanding of O. volvulus transmission dynamics and will be used to monitor changes in biting rates and the success of vector control interventions [23] . Heterogenous exposure to blackfly bites is an important determinant of the observed age-and sex-dependent profiles of O. volvulus infection [5] . Evaluating age-and sex-associated exposure patterns using empirically collected data can help inform transmission dynamics models, as these currently use assumed age-and sex-dependent exposure patterns that have, at best, been derived from fitting the models to age-and sex-specific infection profiles [5] . Such assumptions influence the choice of informative age groups for serological monitoring in stop-MDA surveys [4] , and have implications for understanding the contribution of currently untreated groups to transmission and morbidity [37], as well as for the design and evaluation of potential prophylactic strategies [52] . Testing such assumptions with independently collected data is crucial for better parameterization of transmission models and improved design of epidemiological surveys and surveillance strategies. Therefore, we explored age-and sexrelated patterns of IgG and IgM antibody titres against S. damnosum s.l. saliva across well characterized endemic communities.",

Similar trends have been observed in human antibody responses to the saliva of several mosquito species [53] [54] [55] [56] [57] [58] , posing the question of whether these patterns indicate decreasing exposure to vector bites with age, or increasing immune tolerance and desensitization with persistent or cumulative saliva exposure [59] [60] [61] [62] . Investigation of human IgG responses to sand fly saliva supports the latter proposition, with higher anti-saliva antibody responses observed in new compared to long-term residents of a sand fly-endemic region [63] . Similarly, desensitization to salivary antigens was detected in an area colonized for more than 25 years by Aedes mosquitoes, compared to an area where individuals had been exposed for no longer than 5 years [54] . Following that pattern, median IgG antibody responses also tended to be lower in the current study villages where higher S. damnosum s.l. biting rates were previously reported [30, 42] . Antibody responses to Anopheles mosquito bites measured after the summer season of high vector abundance were considerably higher than those before the summer season; notwithstanding they consistently declined with increasing host age [54, 55] . Interestingly, in that study the decline appeared to be antigen-dependent, as the trend was not detected in antibody responses to a specific recombinantly-expressed protein as opposed to the whole salivary gland homogenate [64] [65] [66] . Several immunogenic proteins were recently detected in S. damnosum s.l. saliva of which most were well-known salivary antigens [23] . Future expression of these in recombinant forms may be instructive and increase assay sensitivity. This is especially interesting for IgM as these antibody responses were shown to be less specific than the IgG responses [23].",

This may reflect sex differences in behaviour such as daily habits, occupation, education, or clothing, that influence physical exposure to blood-seeking blackflies. Male occupants of most ages are responsible for agriculture, farming and fishing in the Pru region and may be less well covered by protective clothing, whereas women are more covered, spend more time at home performing domestic duties and/or engage in long-distance trading activities [67, 68] . The current study was limited in not recording the daily activities of the participants, though biting blackflies appeared to be ubiquitous throughout the day within villages. That females show greater levels of non-specific innate and adaptive immune responsiveness than males, particularly post-puberty, suggests that hormonal involvement (reviewed in [69] ) may contribute to the sex differences observed in this study.",

Such patterns of exposure were predicted by fitting age-and sex-structured onchocerciasis transmission mathematical models to age-and sex-specific profiles of O. volvulus skin microfilariae in another African savannah setting [5] . However, the model fits also indicated that vector exposure of females should increase (rather than decrease) with age. If this is correct, and if women indeed are more intensely exposed as they age, it further supports the case for desensitization with increased long-term biting exposure. Therefore, one next step to better understand exposure patterns with age and sex is to fit dynamic models of antibody acquisition and decay to the (IgG) data obtained here [70, 71] . Future studies of the molecular and cellular mechanisms that underly immune tolerance and progressive desensitization to blackfly saliva would also be most informative. Variations in IgG subclass responsiveness are also possible as shown against Anopheles or Aedes saliva [55, 72] . Interestingly, human IgG4 amongst bee-keepers was found to be associated with immunotolerance to bee venom [73, 74] .",

Although they also declined with age supporting the immunological desensitization hypothesis, IgM responses are generally shorter lived than IgG responses, hence, likely to be more indicative of recent exposure.

In fact, it would be very informative if antibody data generated using our immunoassays could be used in spatial analyses to better understand patterns of vector-human contact with increasing distance from breeding sites. At present, mapping exercises such as those used for Onchocerciasis Elimination Mapping (OEM) collect information on the distribution of breeding sites and vector presence. Our novel tool could complement OEM to identify high-risk locations where exposure to vector bites would provide additional information to seroprevalence surveys to guide start-MDA decisions and identify informative age/sex groups for sampling [75] . Most of the information about the relationship between vector density and distance from breeding sites pertains to African savannah settings (such as those explored here), with less data available to characterize such a relationship in forest and forest-savannah mosaic settings. Therefore, if our anti-vector saliva assays could be combined with (seroprevalence) parasite exposure assays for a range of epidemiological settings, it would be possible to obtain valuable information to help elimination efforts. However, this necessitates the testing and validation of our assays for other species/cytoforms of the S. damnosum complex.",

It remains to be established if the anti-S. damnosum s.l. IgG and IgM antibody responses represent a damnosum complex-specific marker, or if member-specific markers of exposure would be more sensitive. We acknowledge that more data need to be collected to ascertain the validity of our immunoassays to reliably measure exposure to vector bites. Regarding empirical approaches, there are no experimental or observational data yet to precisely quantify the relationship between anti-salivary antibody levels and the number of vector bites. As colonizing blackflies in the laboratory is notoriously difficult, collecting field data to understand the kinetics of the antibody responses over a specified time frame would be helpful, particularly in settings with strong seasonality, in which vector biting ceases or greatly decreases for several months during the year. Regarding theoretical approaches, and as mentioned earlier, the exposure profiles predicted by age-and sex-structured onchocerciasis transmission models are broadly consistent with the proposed desensitization hypothesis. If this proves to be the case, we expect vector saliva-na\u00efve children still to respond well to salivary antigens as an indication of continued exposure to vector bites pre-or post-MDA campaigns in areas with no vector control or without major ecological changes affecting vector density. Our assay could then be used to understand potential secular trends in vector biting rates due to anthropogenic change. Ideally, multiplex assays could be developed to test simultaneously for both exposure to vector bites and to parasite antigens.",
