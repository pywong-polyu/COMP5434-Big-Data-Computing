Despite development and widespread vaccine availability, COVID-19 and its emerging variants are still an evolving situation with more than 800,000 new cases per day in the United States at the time of this writing [3] . As part of the safety protocols, elective surgeries and in-person visits were restricted to decrease the chance of virus transmission and complication, and adapted guidelines released to minimize the risks for both patients and healthcare professionals delivering urological service [4] . The COVID-19 pandemic not only impacted the clinical practice but also other urological domains, including training and research [5, 6] . COVID-19 transmission has interrupted the typical course of urological studies and trials such that numerous research projects have either been slowed down or come to a halt.",

We had a conventional experience with telemedicine, especially for patients who lived in long-distance or out of state regions.

Nevertheless, we were able to continue our PUBMIC (Prophylactic Use of Biologic Mesh in Ileal Conduit) trial (ClinicalTrial.gov number, NCT02439060) [7], given the fact that it included bladder cancer patients undergoing radical cystectomy with curative intent. Yet, we faced major challenges in completing the recruitment and follow-ups of this trial. This trial started in early 2016, aiming to assess the efficacy of biological mesh to decrease the risk of parastomal hernia in patients undergoing cystectomy and ileal conduit. With regards to the recruitment, we witnessed a 50% reduction (24 vs. 48) after the pandemic over the course of 12 months compared to the same period of time in pre-COVID-19 era ( Figure   2 ). In terms of follow-ups, however, we tried to replace the in-person visits with telemedicine. In addition, since the outcome of this trial was mainly focusing on \"radiologic\" parastomal hernia, we inquired the patients to perform imaging with their local facility and send them to our office for review. Despite the limitations, we were able to close the recruitment phase in May 2020 and achieve a > 90% follow-up compliance rate.",

Additionally, we have trained further medical staff to obtain consent from patients in clinic (when present) in order to take advantage of the minimal in-person presence for some of the patients in advance of their surgery. The modifications that we implemented in \"vesicopexy\" protocol helped us to have a satisfactory participation rate in this trial. In the initial two months of the trial, despite the new year's holidays and a surge in the COVID-19 cases, we were able to exceed 75% of the expected enrollment rate.
