Recent research has evidenced an initial impact of the pandemic upon suicide rates, but has yet to understand how elevated financial threat and social isolation may predict suicide ideation/behaviour, or which social factors promote resilience. This study addressed these shortcomings. An online longitudinal survey study (N = 370) which took place from May to September 2020 showed COVID-related financial distress predicts suicidal thoughts and behaviour via increased depression and loneliness. Family identification attenuates these relationships. Our findings reaffirm the importance of social factors in reducing mental ill-health outcomes of economic crises.",

Health and economic threats combined with social distancing measures are likely to have a corrosive effect on mental health, and increase the likelihood of suicide. Initial studies appear to bear these predictions out. While the global picture remains unclear (John et al., 2020) , the first set of nationally-representative surveys from the USA showed a heightened risk of suicide across the general population, with particular effects among vulnerable ethnic and demographic sub-groups (Fitzpatrick et al., 2020) . Looking specifically at areas affected by social distancing measures, Bryan et al. (2020) found associations between multiple stressors and depression, relationship and legal disputes and suicide ideation. Similarly, Gratz et al. (2020) found an association between social restrictions and suicide risk through a lowered sense of social inclusion.",

This has commonly been attributed to a number of specific outcomes of recessions which impact individuals' lives: increased unemployment and job insecurity (Kawohl and Nordt, 2020; Laanani et al., 2015) ; decreased earnings and increased debt (e.g. Coope et al., 2015) , and more personal financial crises (e.g. evictions and foreclosures : Fowler et al., 2015) .

In the earliest theories derived from Durkheim's sociological research, economic crises were thought to weaken social ties and reduce purposefulness, further increasing already-vulnerable individuals' risk of suicidal behaviour (Giddens, 1965) . These social psychological factors have been reworked in more modern psychological theories, including Joiner's (2005) Interpersonal Psychological Theory of Suicide, which argues that 'thwarted belongingness' and 'perceived burdensomeness' are necessary precursors to suicidal ideation. Similarly, O'Connor's Integrated Motivational-Volitional Model (O'Connor and Kirtley, 2018) examines the social context of individuals' lives, thereby identifying risk factors and triggering events which may serve to prompt suicidal thoughts, whilst conceptualising social support and perceived burdensomeness as potential moderators of these effects. While these theories have yet to explicitly tie social factors to economic crises, all acknowledge the pivotal role played by stressors such as financial stress, and buffers such as social support, in predicting suicidal behaviour.",

First, financial hardship can lead to financial distress, whereby a person feels unable to cope with the financial pressures they face. When financial challenges are viewed as a threat and the individual feels unable to cope, they may experience anxiety and depression, which in turn are associated with increased suicide risk (e.g. Assari, 2018; Fiksenbaum et al., 2017) . Financial distress itself has been found to constitute a unique risk factor for self-injury and suicide across a range of different age groups, occupations and nations (Almeida et al., 2012; Duberstein et al., 2004; Fagg et al., 2006; Wang, 2015) , with those experiencing cumulative financial strains being found to have up to twenty times higher suicide risk than those without (Elbogen et al., 2020) .",

Social isolation, exclusion and loneliness have long been understood to be risk factors for suicidality and self-injurious behaviour (Stravynski and Boyer, 2001) , and when combined with financial stress, they can have multiplicative effects on suicide risk (Assari, 2018) . Financial hardship can also serve to isolate individuals and families by depriving them of the means to socialise, as well as through the shame and stigma associated with financial deprivation and debt (Eckhard, 2018; Samuel et al., 2018; Starrin et al., 2009) . In sum, financial stress is a unique predictor of suicidality, which both creates and compounds the psychological vulnerability caused by social isolation and loneliness.",

(2013) showed how deprived communities provide their members with the psychological resources needed to deal with the challenges of economic marginalisation, while Fong et al. (2019) showed how neighbourhood identification buffers the impact of socio-economic disadvantage on residents' mental health. Family identification in particular has been shown to provide significant resilience to the negative mental health effects of financial distress. At the household level, parental support offsets the effects of the stigma associated with economic deprivation (Bradshaw et al., 2016) . Stevenson et al. (2020) also demonstrated that the support provided by cohesive families served to improve mental health, increase resilience to financial challenge and reduce financial distress. Social identities can thus provide resources to counter the effects of economic crises and, in particular, family identity can promote resilience and support one's mental health whilst experiencing financial hardship. However, as important as this research is, it has yet to apply these insights to the exploration of the effects of economic crises on suicidal behaviour: a shortcoming we intend to remedy in the present study.",

Areas of low socio-economic status and community cohesion are likely to be disproportionately affected by income loss and unemployment, as well as by COVID-19 infection and mortality (Wang and Tang, 2020) . However, family identification should provide individuals with some level of resilience against the negative effects of financial stress in the current crisis, though providing supportive relationships and a shared perspective on the threat (Prime et al., 2020) . We thus urgently need to gain insight into the relationships between financial distress, mental health and suicidal behaviours during the pandemic, as well as whether family identification might offset these relationships.

To test H2 and H3, three indirect effects analyses were conducted in order to explore the extent to which T1 family identification negatively predicted T2 suicidal thoughts/behaviour via two parallel mediators: T2 COVID-related financial distress and one of the three psychological variables (T2 loneliness, T2 anxiety or T2 depression). For each analysis, we predicted that higher levels of T1 family identification would predict lower levels of T2 COVID-related financial distress, which in turn would predict better T2 mental health (i.e. lower levels of T2 loneliness, T2 anxiety or T2 depression). In turn, we predicted that better T2 mental health would predict lower levels of T2 suicidal thoughts/behaviour. Model 6 in version 3.4 of Hayes' (2017) PROCESS macro was used to test each model. All models involved 5000 bootstrapping samples with 95% confidence intervals (LLCI/ULCI), using the percentile method. Participants' gender, age, T1 relationship status, T1 employment status, T1 income and the T1 versions of any T2 variables in the model were controlled for. Supporting H2 and H3, each model was significant, and can be seen in Supplemental Figures 1 to 3. Since each of the three individual mediation models was significant, the next step was to include T2 COVID-related financial distress and all three T2 mental health variables (loneliness, anxiety and depression) in a single model. This meant we could explore whether each of the T2 mental health variables continued to significantly predict T2 suicidal thoughts/behaviour when the other T2 mental health variables were controlled for. Model 81 in version 3.4 of Hayes' (2017) PROCESS macro was used, which explores Supplemental Figures 1 to 3 in a single model (see Supplemental Figure 4 for the model).",

It is thus pertinent to consider why these two variables may be of particular importance. First, in terms of loneliness, our results accord with historic and recent models of suicide which conceptualise social isolation and lack of belonging as key predictors of suicide (Joiner, 2005; O'Connor and Kirtley, 2018) . Building on a broad range of evidence pointing to the sociallyisolating effects of financial hardship (e.g. Eckhard, 2018; Samuel et al., 2018) our work serves to highlight the potentially multiplicative effects of economic challenge and social isolation on suicide (Assari, 2018) . Second, the mediating role played by depression in the relationship between financial distress and suicidal thoughts/behaviour is in line with longstanding evidence of the impacts of financial distress on mental health and the particular role of depression as a predictor of suicide (e.g. Handley et al., 2019; Lee and Chou, 2019) .",

Second, our data consists of individual self-reports of family identification rather than the collection of detailed data about family units. Future research would benefit from the greater degree of granularity gained from considering the size and composition of family units on individual's coping ability, while direct observation of how families cope with the challenges of COVID-19 could shed light on the specific aspects of family life which help or hinder financial coping.

As such, our work has several implications for services charged with the alleviation of financial distress and with suicide prevention. We would note that as with the majority of financial support services, suicide prevention strategies are typically targeted and delivered at the level of the individual. While this is often necessary due to issues of sensitivity and confidentiality (as well as limits on staffing and resources) much is to be gained from considering the potential to engage the household or family unit in efforts to provide resilience to specific threats, such as economic crises. Family-based interventions which aim to highlight the shared experience of members and promote a sense of shared identity should unlock much-needed communication, trust, mutual support and collective efficacy. Such psychological resources should in turn help to both promote collective resilience for the household unit and reduce mental health problems and suicide risk among vulnerable family members. Such strengths-based approaches to financial hardship (e.g. Benzies and Mychasiuk, 2009; Walsh, 1996) are especially pertinent in the current pandemic, where individuals are isolated form other forms of social or therapeutic support and are required to spend most of their time in the presence of their families. Under such exceptional circumstances, a family 'pulling together' can have a transformative effect on the otherwise isolating and stigmatising consequences of economic hardship.",
