In addition, alcohol consumption is an important risk factor for a range of social problems, including violent crime [2] , family disruption, child neglect [3] , and work-related problems [4] ; the individual risk of health and social problems increases with increasing consumption [2, 4, 5] . At the population level, an increase in total alcohol consumption is generally accompanied by an increase in the prevalence of heavy drinking [6, 7] ; therefore, an increase in total consumption is typically accompanied by increased population rates of alcohol-related health and social harms [8] , and vice versa (i.e., reduced harm rates accompany a decrease in total consumption). Implicitly, this leads us to the expectation that when the total consumption remains stable, so does the prevalence of heavy drinking and related harm rates. However, this relationship seems not necessarily to be the case always, and a recent study from Norway [9] found increased rates of heavy drinking despite a small decrease in total consumption during the first months of the COVID-19 pandemic. In this study, we explore whether this could also apply to other European countries.",

In many of these studies [10] [11] [12] 14, 15, [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] , the proportion reporting a decrease in alcohol consumption was larger than the proportion reporting an increase in consumption. This tendency has been interpreted as an indication of a decrease in overall consumption [23] . This is indeed one possible explanation of the findings, which could be attributed to reduced affordability and availability of alcohol in addition to fewer opportunities for social occasions to drink during the pandemic [25] .",

            "text": "A few studies have also found that individual changes in consumption were contingent on the pre-pandemic drinking level; i.e., those with initial low consumption tended to report reduced drinking during the pandemic, whereas the group with the initial highest consumption tended to report increased drinking [21, 22] . These findings may suggest two preliminary conclusions; (i) that those drinking at heavy levels changed their consumption differently from other drinkers, and (ii) that despite a preponderance of people reporting reduced drinking, the overall consumption levels-in these survey samples-did not necessarily decrease. For example, the above-mentioned study from Norway [9] found that during the first phase of the COVID-19 pandemic (i.e., March to May 2020), the estimated overall change in alcohol consumption was small. However, among drinkers in the upper 10% of initial consumption (i.e., in the upper 10% of drinkers before or at the start of the pandemic situation), there was an increase in consumption, pushing a number of these drinkers above the high-risk threshold; hence, the estimated prevalence of high-risk drinkers seemed to increase during the first phase of the pandemic. In line with this, studies that examined distributional changes in alcohol consumption at the aggregate level found the prevalence of people reporting heavy drinking to have increased during the pandemic [26, 27] . However, to the best of our knowledge, no other studies have examined whether such a pattern (of heavy drinkers increasing their consumption) has emerged across different countries. The findings from the Norwegian study [9] suggests a simple pattern of positive correlation between initial consumption levels and subsequent increases in consumption during the pandemic. However, other European countries had experienced more intrusive social restrictions, such as curfews and stay-at-home-orders, than Norway had (Table 1) . Such restrictions may impact consumption in various ways: reduced social contact and fewer opportunities for social drinking as well as diminished incomes may reduce consumption for some, whereas, for others, greater alcohol consumption may result from increased stress or boredom, or from improved possibilities to drink heavily without this being noticed at work [25] . Thus, the impact of the pre-pandemic consumption level on the change in alcohol consumption may also differ by country. Consistent with this reasoning, a pan-European study found an average decrease in overall consumption in 19 countries, yet not in Ireland (no change) nor the UK (increase), and the authors argued that differential exposure to pandemic-related stress could be one possible explanation for the country differences observed [23] . It is therefore of interest to explore whether changes in alcohol consumption during the pandemic follow a similar pattern across countries with differing pandemic-related responses, drinking cultures and societal factors, or whether more complex associations emerge. Note: In all countries, alcohol was available in food stores/grocery shops and in the alcohol monopoly outlets in Finland and Norway. See Table S1B for overview of links to sources of information regarding pandemic-related restrictions.",

For this study, we applied all three items in the main analyses (frequency of drinking, quantity of alcohol consumed per occasion, and frequency of 6+ units) (see Table S1A for response options). Standard units of alcohol were described per beverage type in terms of nationally defined standard drinks and corresponded to approximately 10/11 g of pure alcohol, except for Czechia (16 g) and the UK (8 g) (see [23] for details). Thus, to obtain comparable measures of consumption across countries, amounts were multiplied with 1.5 in Czechia and 0.8 in the UK. Initial alcohol consumption was estimated as follows: first, the product of drinking frequency in the past 12 months and usual quantity per occasion (see Table S1A for recoding of variables) was divided by 52 (i.e., number of weeks/year) to obtain number of alcohol units consumed per week. For those reporting a usual quantity per occasion to be less than 6 units, we estimated the volume from occasions when 6+ units were consumed (assuming an average of 7.5 units per 6+ drinking occasion), which was added to the volume described above.",

            "text": "Moreover, in line with the previous study from Norway [9] , we estimated change in volume of alcohol consumption during the COVID-19 pandemic. Following the application of Weber-Fechner's law in psychology to alcohol consumption [7] , the calculation was based on the assumption that a given description of the quantity of change in consumption ('much less/more', 'slightly less/more') will be proportional to the initial consumption level. For example, a person consuming 20 L per year will perceive an increase of 5 L equivalently to an increase of 1 L by a person who drinks 4 L per year [7] . Thus, we applied a model of quantifiable relative changes (see Table S1A for detailed description), corresponding to Model 2 in the previous study from Norway [9] . Here, we assumed that 'much more' represented an increase of +50% and 'much less' represented a decrease of \u221233%, which reflects a symmetrical relative change (e.g., a 50% increase from 6 gives 9, and a 33% reduction from 9 gives 6). 'Slightly more' and 'slightly less' corresponded to +10% and \u22129%, respectively. The magnitude of the relative change assumed in this model is likely to be conservative, considering the substantial individual flux in alcohol consumption from one year to the next, as reported from various countries including the Nordic countries and the USA [31] . From these quantifications of the three variables of changes in drinking behavior, we estimated consumption during the pandemic, and the volume estimate was calculated as explained above. From the estimated initial consumption and the estimated alcohol consumption during the pandemic, we calculated change in alcohol consumption from the initial level to that during the pandemic (in number of alcohol units per week). Missing data/invalid responses on each variable ranged from 0.8% to 1.4%.",

Initial alcohol consumption was categorized by employing the 25th, 50th, 75th, and 90th percentiles of the distribution as cut-offs within each country. Changes in alcohol consumption (change index score and estimated change in units per week) by initial consumption categories were described graphically, and differences between those above the 90th percentile and other drinkers were tested with an F-test. Differences in prevalence of heavy drinking were tested by comparing the two proportions that determine changes in heavy drinking prevalence: (a) the share of all respondents who were below the heavy drinking threshold initially but passed the threshold during the pandemic (new heavy drinkers) to (b) the share of all respondents who drank above the heavy drinking threshold initially, but decreased their drinking to below that threshold during the pandemic (former heavy drinkers).

This graph shows that in seven countries (Czechia, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Norway, Poland and Spain) and among those at initial consumption levels below the 90th percentile, there was little change in consumption from initial to during the pandemic. Additionally, there was no clear patterning in the direction of change. In contrast, among those with the highest initial consumption (above the 90th percentile), there was a marked increase in consumption. In the UK, with the highest average initial consumption of the countries studied, an increase in consumption from initial level to the period during the pandemic was observed also among consumer groups below the 90th percentile ( Figure 1 ). Finally, we explored whether the proportion of heavy drinkers had increased from before to during the pandemic. For each country, we examined the proportion exceeding 28+ units per week initially and during the first months of the pandemic. The proportion of heavy drinkers increased during the pandemic among survey respondents in seven of the eight countries (Table 3) . We conducted two sets of sensitivity analyses.

These analyses showed similar findings as those described for the main analyses: while the upper 10% of drinkers increased their consumption, the remainder had changed their consumption to a very small extent, or-as in Germany or the UK-had increased their consumption to a lesser extent (Table S2A ). This is further illustrated in Figure S1A , showing that in seven countries, estimated change in consumption was small and varied little by consumption level below the 90th percentile, whereas in the UK an increase in consumption was observed at all consumption levels above the median.

In addition to previous reports employing ESAC project data from Germany [22] and Norway [9] , results from a number of studies employing other data sets and methods [21, [36] [37] [38] corroborate our findings, showing that increased drinking was associated with higher initial consumption levels. In contrast, some studies have found that an increase in consumption was associated with a lower initial consumption level [10, 39] . In line with our findings, previous studies have also reported indications that heavy drinking has increased during the pandemic [18, 38] . For instance, in England, the proportion of heavy drinkers (scoring 5+ on AUDIT-C) increased from 25% pre-pandemic to 38% during the April 2020 lockdown [26] . Notably, the mixed findings in the literature reviewed above may well reflect various methodological differences. The novelty of our study pertains to the exploration of possible differences in changes in consumption and heavy drinking, by employing identical methodology across a selection of countries.",

However, it is conceivable that certain pandemic-related factors impacting consumption (e.g., social distancing or isolation and less informal social control when working from home) differ substantially or exert a different impact on heavy drinkers compared to other drinkers, whereas other factors that usually impact consumption (e.g., affordability and physical availability) affect all consumer groups fairly equally. In line with this reasoning, a study from the US [40] found that hazardous alcohol use and possible dependence increased month-by-month for those under lockdowns compared to those not under restrictions, which may suggest that an increase in heavy drinking was a response to being in lockdown.",

While these were more severe in Czechia, Germany, Spain and the UK, and may thus have impacted social availability of alcohol, the polarization of changes in these four countries did not emerge as systematically different from those of the other countries. However, the relative size of changes in consumption did vary by country: in particular, in the UK we observed a higher relative increase in consumption. The markedly higher initial consumption in the UK sample compared with the other countries, may result from a sampling bias. The proportion of heavy drinkers was higher in this study compared to a previous study based on a representative survey in England [41] , suggesting that heavier drinkers may have been over-represented in the UK sample.",

Nevertheless, some potential limitations warrant attention. This study is based on data from a web-survey of convenience samples, employing various sampling methods [23] , and although data were weighted, there may be biases in the consumption distribution [42] and in reported changes in consumption during the pandemic for each country and across countries. Underreporting in survey research on alcohol consumption is well-known [38] . In addition, the format of the ESAC survey failed to identify people who had been abstinent in the year before the pandemic, but who began drinking during the pandemic, which may have led to an underestimation of an increase in consumption. The estimations of changes in alcohol consumption in the current study are based on theory-driven assumptions [4] , and the results are only as robust as these assumptions. Yet, the sensitivity analyses and the similar findings with regard to change in volume of consumption and change index score, suggest that the observed pattern of polarization is robust. The sample size and representativeness did not allow analysis by gender, which might be a relevant factor given the different contexts in which men and women drink in different countries. Country-specific socioeconomic differences in digital skills and possession of Internet-connected devices [43] may have also prevented some of those at heavy drinking levels access to the website-based survey, with impacts on the representativeness of the samples. Finally, our assessment of national pandemic-related restrictions was crude, and we could not account for or standardize all the different characteristics of all relevant national and regional restrictions and interactions with existing policy, which means that drawing conclusions about the mechanism of this change is not possible.",

Moreover, an increase in the number of heavy drinkers implies an additional burden on a variety of health care services during an already challenging period, as heavy drinkers are at high risk of acute injuries and substantial risk of new-or complications of existing-somatic or mental health problems [1, 38, 42] . There is also some indication that heavy drinkers (especially when drinking) are less able or likely to comply with social distancing recommendations [44, 45] , or vaccination schedules, increasing the COVID-19-risk for this vulnerable group. Further research into the possible effects of the pandemic on the distribution of alcohol consumption and heavy drinking is needed, in order to plan pandemic responses more effectively. Similarly, there is a need to provide health care and possible treatment to those at pre-clinical but high levels who are at risk of increasing their drinking during the pandemic, with negative health consequences.",

Figure S1A : Change in estimated volume of consumption by initial consumption level and country. Sensitivity analysis: HED excluded from calculations of initial alcohol consumption and quantified change in alcohol consumption., Figure S1B : Change in estimated volume of consumption by initial consumption level and country. Sensitivity analysis: assuming a larger relative quantified change in drinking frequency, usual quantity per occasion and consumption from HED occasions. Institutional Review Board Statement: Participation to the survey was voluntary and fully anonymous: respondents could choose not to answer any of the questions and could terminate participation in the survey at any time. Providing an explicit declaration of consent was mandatory to access the survey. As the survey was fully anonymous and the personal data were protected in accordance with the EU Regulation 2016/679 of the European Parliament and Council, ethical approval by a research ethics committee was not needed, as confirmed by the Data Protection Officer of the Technische Universit\u00e4t Dresden (Germany; letter available upon request).
