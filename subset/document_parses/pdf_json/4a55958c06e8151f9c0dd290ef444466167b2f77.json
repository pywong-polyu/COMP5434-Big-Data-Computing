We selected the targets related to diarrhea through the DisGeNET database, then used the NCBI database to screen out related targets of lactase and sucrase, and constructed the visual network to search for the active ingredients of GD in the treatment of diarrhea and related mechanisms of the targets. Combined with network pharmacology, we screened out 146 active ingredients in GD corresponding to 252 ingredient targets, combined with 328 disease targets in diarrhea, and obtained 12 lactase targets and 11 sucrase targets. e key active ingredients involved quercetin, formononetin, \u03b2-sitosterol kaempferol, and wogonin. Furthermore, molecular docking showed that these five potential active ingredients had good affinities with the core targets PTGS2. e active ingredients in GD (such as quercetin, formononetin, and \u03b2-sitosterol) may increase the microbial activity of the intestinal mucosa of mice and reduce the microbial activity of the intestinal contents through multiple targets, thereby achieving the effect of treating diarrhea.",

Research on the nature of syndromes and animal models of syndromes plays a beneficial role in revealing the scientific connotation of syndromes and the objectification of syndromes. Diarrhea with intestinal damp heat syndrome (IDHS) refers to the accumulation of dampness-heat in the intestinal tract, which is mainly manifested by abdominal pain, urgency of diarrhea, and yellowish brown and stinky feces [1] . With the changes of people's lifestyle and diet structure, IDHS diarrhea has become a multiple disease. Diabetes, chronic liver disease, kidney disease, ulcerative colitis, and other diseases are often accompanied by IDHS diarrhea. erefore, strengthening the study of diarrhea with IDHS can expand the prevention and treatment of these major diseases.",

It was found that the activity of lactase in the intestinal tract of diarrhea irritable bowel syndrome rats was significantly lower than that of the control group (p < 0.05), and the activity of sucrase in the intestinal contents and mucosa of mice with dysbacteriosis and diarrhea was significantly decreased compared with the control group (p < 0.01) [7, 8] . Different kinds of enzymes reflect the active degree of microbial participation in biochemical reactions, while microbial activity often represents the overall activity of hydrolases and can be used as an important indicator of microbial decomposition ability [9, 10] . As a colorless nonpolar organic compound, fluorescein diacetic acid (FDA) can be hydrolyzed by nonspecific enzymes (esterase, protease, lipase, etc.) in bacteria and fungi, and its hydrolytic activity is directly proportional to the number of microbial populations [11] . erefore, the total activity of microorganisms in the animal intestinal tract can be reflected by measuring the degree of FDA hydrolysis of intestinal samples.",

Among them, quercetin, formononetin, beta-sitosterol, kaempferol, and wogonin were the main active ingredients screened out in the network, and PTGS2, HSP90, CALM, AR, and ESR1 were the main active targets, and both played an important role in the regulation of lactase and sucrase by GD. At the same time, according to the target information of diarrhea, lactase and sucrase, we constructed the diarrhea-potential target-enzyme network. In this network analysis, we indicated that HNF1A might play an important role in diarrhea affecting lactase and sucrase. en, we used Cytoscape 3.7.2 software to construct the GD-active ingredient-enzyme-diarrhea network. e results showed that quercetin, formononetin, beta-sitosterol, kaempferol, and wogonin played an important role in the regulation of lactase and sucrase activity by GD in the treatment of diarrhea. Quercetin is one of the more important bioflavonoids found in current research [37, 38] . Quercetin affects the quantity and quality of the intestinal microbiota, thereby indirectly affecting their own metabolism and bioavailability [39] . Studies have indicated that quercetin can enhance the tolerance of diabetic animals to hyperglycemia and control the further development of diabetic complications by regulating the activity of lactase in the intestine of diabetic rats [40] . According to the results of in vitro experiments [41] , quercetin significantly support the proliferation of Lactobacillus within a certain concentration range, and Lactobacillus contributes to the hydrolysis of intestinal enzymes. Some studies have reported that active ingredients such as formononetin and \u03b2-sitosterol have certain anti-inflammatory effects. ese anti-inflammatory effects can be achieved through the regulation of intestinal flora. Among them, formononetin achieve the anti-inflammatory effect by regulating intestinal flora in the process of diarrhea [42] . \u03b2-Sitosterol treatment to intestinal epithelial cells significantly increases expression of antimicrobial peptides and reduces survival of intracellular Salmonella typhimurium [43] . Also, some bacteria in the intestine are involved in affecting the regulation of intestinal enzymes. It is inferred that these active ingredients may regulate intestinal enzyme activity by regulating some bacteria in the intestine, thus achieving the effect of treating diarrhea. On this basis, we also found that some ingredients in GD might act on multiple targets, while the phenomenon that different ingredients act on the same target together reflected the mechanism of interaction between multiple ingredients in TCM and multiple targets. Molecular docking studies were carried out to confirm the interaction between active ingredients and diarrhearelated potential target at the molecular level. is determined the binding pose of the active ingredients when bound to the target protein and suggested that the active ingredients might have high binding affinity for proteins encoded by diarrhea-related genes. e results of this study showed that the combination of GD and diarrhea target binding energy was negative, indicating that there was binding activity between the ingredient and the target protein. Among these interactions, the most important node (formononetin) had the high affinity with potential target in the molecular docking score. is result indicated that instead of one ingredient interacting with one target protein, one or more ingredients interact with multiple target proteins. Based on this, it was speculated that these ingredients might play an important role in GD in regulating the expression of diarrhea target protein.",

Simultaneously, there were still limitations in this study, i.e., the forecast results were obtained based on existing limited databases and might involve the existence of factors such as insufficient research on key targets of diarrhea, unknown chemical composition and structure of GD, and the interaction relationship between the ingredients. Additionally, this study only provides a preliminary hypothesis for the scientific study of TCM; animal experiments, molecular experiments, and clinical investigations should be performed to verify the mechanism of GD against diarrhea in future studies.",
