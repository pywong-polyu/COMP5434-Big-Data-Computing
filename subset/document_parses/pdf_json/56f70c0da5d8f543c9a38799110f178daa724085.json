The mole concept is used to estimate the number of normal alveolar cells per human lung. The number of coronavirus infections in infected alveolar cells is estimated from the published Lower Respiratory Tract (LRT) load data. The Poisson probability distribution is aptly applied to imply the incubation period of the coronavirus infection to be within day-3 to day-7, with the cumulative probability of 75%. The incubation period within day-0 to day-10 has a cumulative probability of 98%. It implies a 10-day quarantine to isolate an uninfected individual as a precautionary measure.",

Consequently, in the so-called Phase 3 of vaccination testing, a large number of volunteers, as finite numbers of volunteers at a number of centers, are tested for vaccine efficacy. In mathematical statistics, a large number of volunteers form a population. The finite numbers of volunteers (at each center) are the samples of the population. A probability distribution of the negative response of volunteers to vaccine in samples is thus evaluated; which enables to determine the vaccine efficacy. A number of vaccines for the COVID-19 pandemic have been developed, with a range of mean vaccine efficacy of 60% to 95%.

The tissue cells of alveoli, the alveolar macrophages, are large scavenger cells. They remove foreign bodies such as dust, viruses and bacteria from blood, tissues and organs. In essence, the immune cells, B cells and T cells, types of \"small\" white blood cells, act on viruses. The T cells \"memorize\", \"identify\" and \"remember\" how to fight the virus infection. The B cells \"make\" antibodies to neutralize the virus infection before the viruses infect cells. The virus infected \"perished\" cells are also removed in the process. The size of B cells and T cells, which are in globular shape, is: d \u2248 8000 nm [1, Table 12 .2]. The alveolar cell size is taken as d \u2248 8000 nm.

            "text": "A coronavirus penetrates a cell. It replicates to produce virus particles, the virions. Overwhelmed by the virions, the cell perishes. Then the released virus and virions, collectively the viruses, attack other cells. It is anticipated that one is infected by coronavirus in about ten minutes after close contact with an infected person. It is termed the virion entry into cell [3] . Thus, the virus-infected volume of air that could infect the human lung in ten minutes is about: 10 x 1/3 x 16 x 500 cm 3 \u2248 2.7 x 10 4 cm 3 \u2248 10 4 cm 3 , which is greater than the lung volume of 1.5 x 10 3 cm 3 . However, the initial virus dose does not decide the severity of infection, that is, the number of infected alveolar cells. It is the activation of an individual's immune system, triggered by the coronavirus, which decides the number of infected alveolar cells. Also, the immune response (immunity) of the human body, in terms of white blood cells (B cells and T-cells) and the presence of antibodies against the virus, varies with individuals. A measure of \"healthy\" immunity in terms of the amount (mass density, number density) of immune B-and T-cells is unknown. The amount of B-and T-cells is a function of many factors, including age [4] . The number of infected alveolar cells may be estimated in terms of the viral load of an infected individual. The viral load is measured as the quantity of virus \"copies\" per unit volume (millilitre -1 , ml -1 , or cm -3 ). The viral load data has been reported in fourteen patients from Germany and one patient from China [5] . Two sets of data are given, one each for Upper Respiratory Tract (URT, mild COVID-19 symptoms) and Lower Respiratory Tract (LRT, moderate to severe COVID-19 symptoms, lung infection). (The mild URT symptoms may include fever, without shortness of breath, that is, normal respiratory rate. The moderate LRT symptoms may include breathlessness, high respiratory rate and low blood oxygen levels. The severe LRT symptoms may include breathlessness, higher respiratory rate and lower blood oxygen levels.) In general, the URT virus load is lower than the LRT viral load by two orders of magnitude, that is, by a factor of 100 (10 2 ) [5] . The LRT virus load may be used to estimate the infected alveolar cells as follows. The LRT viral load of a \"representative\" patient#3 in Germany is about 10 6 copies ml -1 on day-4 and day-5 of infection. The viral load is about 10 5 copies ml -1 from day-6 to day-15 of infection. The viral load \"exponentially\" falls to about 10 4 copies ml -1 from day-16 to day-20. Here, the minimum detectable viral load is 100 (10 2 ) copies ml -1 . The LRT viral load of the patient in China is about 10 5 copies ml -1 and 10 7 copies ml -1 on day-3 and day-4-to -day-6 of infection, respectively. Then the viral load \"exponentially\" falls to about 10 5 copies ml -1 on day-8 and about 10 3 copies ml -1 on day-9 -to -day-11 of infection, respectively. Here, the minimum detectable viral load is 1 (10 0 ) copies ml -1 . It seems reasonable to assume a viral load of 10 6 copies ml -1 (on day-5) to estimate the number of infected alveolar cells. The average number of virions produced by a single infected cell, the \"per cell viral yield\", termed Burst size, is 10 3 virions [3] . The coronavirus size parameter is 100 nm [3] . Thus, the number of coronavirus infected alveolar cells is: 10 6 /10 3 ml -1 = 10 3 ml -1 (or cm -3 ). Since the average lung volume is about 1.5 x 10 3 cm 3 , the estimated number of infected alveolar cells in the human lung is: 1.5 x 10 3 x 10 3 \u2248 1.5 x 10 6 \u2248 10 6 .",

            "text": "The probability of occurrence of coronavirus infection is small. The number of infections in terms of the infected alveolar cells of 10 3 (per lung volume, Section 3) is much less than the number of alveolar cells of 10 9 (per lung volume, Section 2). A Poisson distribution function is an analytical form for the probability distribution of such data [6, Chapter 3]. The Poisson probability distribution is applicable when the probability of an event is very small, small, or unknown. For illustration, from Section 3, the LRT viral load per day, over a period of 15 days, are the set of infection events. In the Poisson distribution function, day-5 is roughly the mean of days of infection events, corresponding to the maximum of LRT viral load (on day-5). (The model fitted curves in Fig. 2 and Fig. 4B in [5] are bounded essentially only on the left side of the mean, which is considered appropriate for the Poisson probability distribution [6, Chapter 3] ). With mean \u00b5 = 5 day, one may compute the probability of an infection on day-0, day-1, day-2,\u2026, day-15 of the occurrence of coronavirus infection. Hence, these probabilities may be multiplied by the viral load of 10 6 copies ml -1 to estimate the viral load and the infected alveolar cells on each day. The maximum LRT viral load is on day-5 of the 15-day infection period, for example. For the Poisson distribution of LRT viral load with day, given by the variable X, the mean \u00b5 is considered significant within \u00b1\u03c3. One has X = \u00b5 \u00b1 \u03c3, where \u03c3 is the standard deviation. Here, \u00b5 = 5 and \u03c3 = \u221a\u00b5 = \u221a5 = 2.24 \u2248 2 (day). Thus, X = 5 \u00b1 2; or, 3 \u2264 X \u2264 7. The infection symptoms may appear within day-3 to day-7 of the exposure to infection, mean day-5 (\u00b5 = 5), with a 75% cumulative probability of infections. The range of occurrence of infections 3 \u2264 X \u2264 7 is the incubation period [5] . For the mean \u00b5 to be significant within \u00b12\u03c3, X = \u00b5 \u00b1 2\u03c3 = 5 + 2 x 2.24 \u2248 5 \u00b1 5 (0 \u2264 X \u2264 10), the cumulative probability for a Poisson distribution with mean day-5 (\u00b5 = 5) is 98%. Thus, the cumulative probability of the occurrence of infections is 98% for the exposure to infection within day-0 to day-10.",

(The number of groups of persons based on the age criterion is 3 at 99 centers.) The present study considers the vaccine testing in a population of 14100 volunteers, as N = 300 samples of n = 47 volunteers each. The vaccine efficacy is 94.1%. Thus, the probability (p) of negative response of vaccine in a sample is 5.9%; p = 0.059. Also, the average number of volunteers (\u00b5) in a sample testing negative to vaccine is: \u00b5 = n x p = 47 x 0.059 = 2.773 (\u2248 3). Since p << 1 and, therefore, \u00b5 << n, the Poisson probability distribution aptly describes the vaccine testing procedure. The Poisson distribution function, with mean equal to 2.773 (\u00b5) volunteers testing negative to the vaccine, is used to compute the probability of groups of volunteers (say, a group of 3 volunteers) testing negative to the vaccine in a sample. Hence, by chance, any groups of volunteers in 300 samples testing negative to vaccine are determined. These groups of volunteers testing negative for 95% confidence interval are examined vis-\u00e0-vis the average number of volunteers obtained with 89.3% and 96.8% vaccine efficacy (95% confidence interval 89.3% -96.8%).",

The occurrence of coronavirus infection in human beings is statistically analyzed in terms of the number of coronavirus infected alveolar cells compared to normal alveolar cells in human lungs. The mole concept, that is, one mole of a substance (biological, virus, or vaccine) contains Avogadro's number of particles (cells, viral particles, or specific antigens) is applied. It leads to the number of normal alveolar cells of size parameter 8000 nm per human lung volume as 10 9 . The number of coronavirus infections in terms of infected alveolar cells is estimated from the published Lower Respiratory Tract (LRT) load data in patients from Germany and China. The number of infected alveolar cells of size 100 nm per human lung volume is 10 3 . The number of coronavirus infections in infected alveolar cells (per lung volume) is much less than the number of normal alveolar cells (per lung volume). The Poisson probability distribution is aptly used to imply the appearance of symptoms, the incubation period, of coronavirus infection to be within day-3 to day-7of the exposure to infection. The cumulative probability, with mean incubation on day-5, is 75%. The cumulative probability, with mean incubation on day-5, for the infection to be between day-0 to day-10 of the exposure to infection is 98%.",

These are Moderna's mRNA-1273, Oxford-AstraZeneca's ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (AZD1222) and Bharat BioTech's COVAXIN. The vaccine mRNA-1273 is a messenger (m) RNA-based vaccine that carries the SARS CoV-2 virus spike immunogen. The vaccine AZD1222 is a genetically modified preparation from chimpanzee adenovirus. The vaccine COVAXIN is prepared using live but inactivated SARS-CoV-2 virus. The mole concept leads to the antigen mass density per dose of each of these vaccines as 10 g cm -3 , 0.1 g cm -3 and 1 g cm -3 , respectively. Thus, the estimated mass density of an antigen dose is ~ 10 0\u00b11 g cm -3 . The vaccines are deemed to be compatible to neutralize the infection.",

The Moderna's mRNA-1273 vaccination testing scenario comprises 300 samples of 47 volunteers each. The Moderna's 94.1% vaccine efficacy, probability p = 0.059 (5.9%), implies that on average 3 volunteers per sample have a negative response to vaccine, by chance. Since the probability of negative response of vaccine is small, the Poisson probability distribution for 95% cumulative probability is used to describe the vaccination testing. Thus, 87% of samples (i.e., 261 samples) have groups of 3 volunteers testing negative to the vaccine. Also, 10% of samples (i.e., 30 samples) have groups of 7 volunteers testing negative to vaccine. About 0.5% of samples (i.e., 2 samples) have groups of 9 -10 volunteers testing negative to vaccine, with a small probability. About 6% of samples (i.e., 18 samples) have all volunteers testing positive to vaccine. (The total number of samples is 311, which is roughly 300 samples.) The Oxford's ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccination testing scenario comprises 75 samples of 120 volunteers each. The Oxford's 62.1% vaccine efficacy, probability p = 0.379 (37.9%), implies that on average 45 volunteers per sample have a negative response to vaccine, by chance. Since the probability of negative response of vaccine is finite, the Gaussian (or normal) probability distribution for 95% probability is used to describe the vaccine testing. Thus, 68% of samples (i.e., 51 samples) have groups of 45 volunteers testing negative to vaccine. Also, 9% of samples (i.e., 7 samples) of groups of 39 volunteers, and another 9% of samples (i.e., 7 samples) of groups of 52 volunteers, test negative to the vaccine. Additionally, 4% of samples (i.e., 3 samples) of groups of 36 volunteers, and another 4% samples (i.e., 3 samples) of groups of 54 volunteers, test negative to vaccine. No sample has all volunteers testing positive to vaccine. (The total number of samples is 71. In addition, about four samples may have a random fluctuation of groups of volunteers below 35 volunteers or above 55 volunteers, with a low probability.) A generalized vaccination testing procedure is one in which both sample size of volunteers being vaccinated and number of samples is 100, each, in order to evaluate vaccine efficacy. It makes the total number of samples 200, including the placebo group of volunteers.",

            "text": "Analysis of Oxford's 62.1% Vaccine Efficacy In Phase 3, in Oxford's vaccine testing procedure, there are 4807 volunteers at 19 centers in the UK and 4088 volunteers at 6 centers in Brazil; total of 8895 volunteers at 25 centers [8]. There are 8895 volunteers at effectively 75 (3 x 25 = 75) centers at an average of 118.6 (\u2248 120) volunteers per center. (The number of groups of persons based on the age criterion is 3 at 25 centers.) The present study considers the vaccine testing in a population of 8895 volunteers, as N = 75 samples of n = 118.6 volunteers each. The vaccine efficacy is 62.1%. Thus, the probability (p) of negative response of vaccine in a sample is 37.9%; p = 0.379. Also, the average number of volunteers (\u00b5) in a sample testing negative to vaccine is: \u00b5 = n x p = 118.6 x 0.379 = 44.949 = 45.0. The average number of volunteers testing negative is: \u00b5 x 75 = 45.0 x 75 = 3375 volunteers testing negative. (Alternately, the average number of volunteers testing negative is 3371, p x 8895 = 0.379 x 8895 = 3371.2 (\u2248 3375), in the population of 8895.) Since p is finite, the Gaussian (or normal) probability distribution describes the vaccine testing procedure. (The Gaussian distribution function describes the data that is symmetric about the mean [6, Chapter 3]). The Gaussian distribution function, with mean equal to 45 (\u00b5) volunteers testing negative to vaccine, is used to compute the probability of groups of volunteers (say, a group of 45 volunteers) testing negative to the vaccine in a sample. Hence, by chance, any groups of volunteers in 75 samples testing negative to vaccine are determined. These groups of volunteers testing negative for 95% confidence interval are examined vis-\u00e0-vis the average number of volunteers obtained with 41.0% and 75.7% vaccine efficacy (95% confidence interval 41.0% -75.7%).",
