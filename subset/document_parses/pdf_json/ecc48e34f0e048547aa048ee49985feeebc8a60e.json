Although many new therapeutic strategies are being trialed, current treatments for patients infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) are usually supportive, including immuno-modulatory or anti-inflammatory steroids 3 , or only administered based on emergency use, e.g., remdesivir, originally developed to treat Ebola. 4 Barictinib, approved for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and shows positive activity in the ACTT-II trial, appears to have both anti-viral as well as anti-cytokine activity. 5 Patients who contract SARS-CoV-2 often develop life-threatening complications, including a severe form of acute lung injury (ALI) known as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). However, there are limited treatment options for ARDS 6 ; thus, identifying a safe and effective treatment for ALI is needed.",

Excessive production of mucus in the airways is linked to a number of different complications including increased duration and fre-quency of infections, decreased lung function, and increased mortality in patients with respiratory disease. 7 Previous studies suggest MUC1 might be used as a prognostic marker of SARS-CoV-2 severity, as increased levels of MUC1 in serum have been shown in patients with interstitial pneumonitis and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. 8 In this current study, Kost-Alimova et al. 1 performed a high-content immunofluorescence imaging screen using MUC1 expression as readout and identified fostamatinib, a SYK inhibitor, as a potent compound that significantly reduced MUC1 protein abundance. Their findings indicated the potential of repurposing fostamatinib (R788) for the treatment of ALI. Indeed, SYK has been used as a therapeutic target in many different roles, especially within the immune system, ranging from arthritis to asthma 9,10 , and MUC1 has been a well-known albeit failed target in oncology. Fostamatinib was previously approved by the FDA for chronic immune thrombocytopenia.",

During the COVID-19 pandemic, the aim shifted to looking for drugs reducing expression of MUC1-wild type (wt) protein to treat SAR-CoV-2-induced ALI. Expression patterns of MUC1 were analyzed using the Human Protein Atlas and MUC1 expression was demonstrated in alveolar epithelium, using immunoperoxidase staining of human lung tissue, implicating MUC1 in lung function. Imaging from high content screening was quantified using the STAR morphology ''Profile'' Module, to follow localization of MUC1 on the plasma membrane versus intracellular localization in the presence of test compounds as a readout. Criteria for inclusion of certain drugs over others during screening included the following: reduction of MUC1-wt protein in a dosedependent manner, favorable toxicity profiles, reduction of MUC1 via non-transcriptional mechanisms, and, finally, they had to be FDA approved.",

High expression of MUC1 on the plasma membrane of these cells allows for assessment of MUC1 abundance, while cell number is easily determined for the assessment of cell toxicity. Dose response curves were prepared for over 200 positive hits and a further thirteen candidates were then selected for qPCR analysis to determine any correlation between MUC1 protein reduction, MUC1 mRNA reduction, and cell viability screens. One test compound, R406 was shown to reduce plasma membrane MUC1 and increase levels of the protein intracellularly, unlike other compounds tested. Kost-Alimova et al. 1 only selected test compounds that did not act via transcriptional mechanisms, as there is evidence suggesting low clinical efficacy at the transcriptional level. Therefore, as a result of these criteria, only four drugs were found showing a safe toxicity profile, with only one, R406, already approved by the FDA. Additional SYK inhibitors were ",
