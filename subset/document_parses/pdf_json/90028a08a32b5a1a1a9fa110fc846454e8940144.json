From still images, position-sensitive, quantitative intensity, or colorimetric information can be obtained. Video images made of a time series of still images can provide time-dependent, quantitative intensity, or colorimetric information in addition to the position-sensitive information from a single still image. With the aid of novel image processing/analysis software, extraction of position-and time-sensitive quantitative colorimetric information was demonstrated from still image and video images of litmus test strips for pH tests of solutions. Visual inspection of the color change in the litmus test strips after chemical reaction with chemical solutions is typically exercised. Visual comparison of the color of the test solution with a standard color chart provides an approximate pH value to the nearest whole number. Accurate colorimetric quantification and dynamic analysis of chemical properties from captured still images and recorded video images of test solutions using novel image processing/analysis software are proposed with experimental feasibility study results towards value-added image sensor applications. Position-and time-sensitive quantitative colorimetric measurements and analysis examples are demonstrated.",

We mostly rely, for color judgement and description, on our experience in daily life. In most cases, inaccurate color description does not cause serious problems. It is a matter of preference. However, it can cause unexpected or serious problems including life threatening accidents in medical, pharmaceutical, food science, and agricultural areas. For the fashion industry, paint industry, food industry, commercial product manufacturing industry, and chemical industries we are a little more cautious about color description, because it can affect safety, marketing, and product quality control, and finally, their revenue. The ability to quantitatively determine colorimetric data can provide competitive advantages. Image sensors and spectrometers are essential for these applications [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] . We would like to introduce the effective use of image sensors as position-and time-sensitive quantitative colorimetric characterization devices with the aid of novel image processing/analysis software. Application examples are given using simple litmus test strips with a wide range of colors depending on the pH value of solutions.",

Color is used as an index of composition of test solutions. The color of test solutions is compared with a standard color chart to estimate the nature and properties of test solutions, accurate to the nearest whole number. Unlike a ruler for length measurement, we cannot accurately estimate or imagine colors between any two reference colors. For length measurement using a ruler, we can easily estimate it in decimal points. However, color estimation is very difficult, and estimation results can vary significantly between individuals unless colorimetric or spectroscopic quantification techniques are utilized [7, 8] . If color is changed with time, it is even more difficult. We are losing a significant amount of valuable information due to our inability for objective and quantitative analysis of color by the naked eye.",

The pH indicators, such as litmus paper made from absorbent paper, change color in accordance with the pH of a test solution. Visual comparison of the color of the test solution with a standard color chart provides an approximate pH value to the nearest whole number. The color chart in the kit shows corresponding color for solutions with pH values in whole number range between 1 and 14. At 25 \u2022 C, pH value 7 is neutral. A pH less than 7 is acidic, and solutions with a pH greater than 7 are basic. The neutral value of the pH depends on temperature. It becomes smaller than 7 if the temperature increases. The pH scale is logarithmic and inversely indicates the concentration of hydrogen ions in the solution. A lower pH indicates a higher concentration of hydrogen ions. The pH calculation formula uses the negative of the base 10 logarithm of the molar concentration of hydrogen ions in the solution [12] . The pH value can also be less than 0 for very strong acids, or greater than 14 for very strong bases [13] . Three litmus paper strips tested using three different test solutions A, B, and C from different suppliers are also shown in Figure 1 as real test examples with color variations within tested regions of the strips. Untested litmus paper strips with standard color chart for pH reading were photographed and video recorded under the controlled (color and brightness varying) illumination conditions for time series analysis of color on the standard color chart and white blank area.",

The discrete color scale for pH values of 1-14 were interpolated to generate a continuous color chart to estimate pH values with 0.1 pH accuracy from the color of test strips ( Figure 5 ). For easy understanding, a 15 cm ruler was placed next to the continuous color scale. The pH values can be directly read from the ruler where the apparent color of tested strips can be viewed.

The color scale was converted to the pH scale for 1.0-14.0 on the top portion of Figure 5 . If the color scale is perfectly generated, the slope of the pH scale graph as a function of colors in the range of 1.0 to 14.0 should be a straight line in the graph. As seen from the top portion of Figure 5 , the line is not quite straight. However, it covers pH values from 1.0 to 14.0 and provides a reasonable approximation for pH conversion from the actual color of tested strips. The continuous color scale and its conversion formula for pH value estimation can be improved and optimized by collecting more test data and subsequent calibration.",

Each point in an image is referred to as a pixel. To demonstrate characteristics of the diffusion speed of test solutions on litmus test strips and pH variations with time, video images were recorded and analyzed. A drop of test solution was placed at the edge of a test paper strip, and liquid diffusion and color change were recorded as a video file (Video S2). Figure 7 shows a still image extracted from a video image file 10 s after liquid crossed the left blue tick on the ruler. From the image, we can estimate average diffusion speed of 1.1 mm/s (diffused distance of 11 mm in 10 s) assuming constant diffusion speed. If we can analyze the video images, no assumption is required for diffusion speed characterization. Color information along the red line on the litmus paper is extracted from every frame of video image for dynamic analysis. Figure 8a shows five still images at 0, 5, 10, 15, and 20 s after the liquid crossed the left blue tick (distance reference: 0 mm). As seen from the figure, the liquid diffusion speed slows down with time. This may be due to the depletion of liquid source and increase in diffusion resistance with diffusion length increase. If we extract color information along the red line (or any line) along the direction of diffusion on the litmus paper from every frame of a video image and reconstruct a time series of images, diffusion dynamics can be visualized as a time cross-section image. No assumption is required for analysis. We recorded video images for 26 s (from \u22124 s to 22 s) at 30 fps (frames per second). The total of 720 frames of still images (30 fps \u00d7 26 s = 720 frames) were recorded in a video file (Video S2). Figure 8b is the reconstructed image from 720 frames. Only one line per frame at the same location (horizontal red line in Figure 7 ) was extracted and reconstructed as a time series (time cross-sectional) image. As seen from the image, liquid diffusion speed slows with time and showed parabolic or quadratic behaviors. It also shows that the color of the diffusion front is darker, implying a chemical reaction is in progress. If we extract colorimetric information along the line perpendicular to the diffusion or reaction front, we will get an exact location of the diffusion boundary and any color variation along the colorimetric sampling line as shown in Figure 7 . If we were taking statistics of sampling aerial data, it can provide average, minimum, maximum, range, mode, standard deviation, and more statistical information of colorimetric data on the sampled area. of 720 frames of still images (30 fps \u00d7 26 s = 720 frames) were recorded in a video file (Video S2).

Sensors 2020, 20, x FOR PEER REVIEW 9 of 16 The diffusion speed of test solutions (A, B, and C) and color change in litmus test paper strips were visualized as time series images by analyzing video files, as shown in Figure 9 . It represents the change in color in a selected line on the litmus paper with time. It visualizes the chemical reaction and diffusion on the sampling line on the litmus test strip over time after dropping a drop of test solution C at the edge of the test strip. The colorimetric data in Figures 8 and 9 can be translated into pH values at any point and time. The color image is not only different in appearance but also a rich source of valuable chemical information of test solutions at any point and time. We can even transform the 2D image into a 3D surface plot with distance (x), time (y), and pH (z) axes for more intuitive graphical expression. Figure 10 is the reprocessed image of Figure 9 . The location of reaction/diffusion front for every frame was highlighted. It is a simplified image and only carries significantly reduced information (reaction/diffusion front as a function of time with no pH information). It resembles an old-fashioned X-t chart recorder image and an X-Y graph (X axis: distance of diffusion and Y axis: time after test solution drop). We certainly feel much more comfortable with this type of simplified graph, because we were trained that way for a long time. However, there is no reason why we have to intentionally reduce information from the original, information-rich image data. We may need to accept a paradigm shift and find a new way of dealing with information-rich image data without intentional filtering for simplification.

Judging from Figure 10 , it is clear that the test solution A (cider) is the fastest diffusing solution through the test strip. The slowest diffusing solution is found to be the test solution C (apple vinegar). The test solution A (cider) and B (refreshment drink) have lower pH values (2.2 to 4.2: strongly acidic) compared to the test solution C (apple vinegar, 5.0-5.9: mild acidity, close to black coffee).",

Judging from Figure 10 , it is clear that the test solution A (cider) is the fastest diffusing solution through the test strip. The slowest diffusing solution is found to be the test solution C (apple vinegar). The test solution A (cider) and B (refreshment drink) have lower pH values (2.2 to 4.2: strongly acidic) compared to the test solution C (apple vinegar, 5.0-5.9: mild acidity, close to black coffee).",

This makes still and video image analysis for colorimetric and time dependence study very difficult. For automation of image analysis, application specific algorithms have to be developed.

Potential hardware-related issues such as different cameras/sensors, quality of the hardware, and settings (e.g., resolution, source of light/lighting conditions, etc.) can be optimized after initial tests. In most cases, cameras/sensors can be selected based on specifications (e.g., resolution, sensitivity, auto focusing, auto contrast, auto brightness control, auto exposure, file format, etc.). Light source and lighting can either be selected or designed to be suitable for specific applications. Noise reduction, smoothing, threshold switching, resolution enhancement, color adjustment, and customized functions can be added.

However, our memory has limitations and our ability to communicate the information with others is also limited. With the help of image sensors, we can complement our shortfalls in memory and communication. Still images and video images acquired using image sensors are very valuable sources of information. From still images, position-sensitive, quantitative colorimetric information can be obtained. Time-dependent quantitative colorimetric information can be obtained from video images. With aid of novel image processing/analysis software, extraction of position-and time-sensitive quantitative colorimetric information was demonstrated from both still and video images.
