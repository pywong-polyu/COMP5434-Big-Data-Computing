The heterogeneity of glycosylation results in a wide variability in the apparent levels of IL-6, TNF, and IL-1beta [47] . ApoA-I also has several valuable carrier protein properties: namely, it circulates in the body for a long time, is readily biodegradable, is not immunogenic, and binds specifically to most cell types due to the presence of SR-BI receptors [48] .",

Additionally, it is not known whether the biological activity of the cytokine will be fully preserved. In the literature, there are examples of a decrease in the biological activity of cytokines in the development of fusion hybrid constructs [49] [50] [51] . Parameters such as the type, length, and flexibility of the linker, as well as the way the cytokine binds to the protein (at the C or N-terminus of the module) can directly affect the biological activity of the fusion protein.",

As seen in Figure 2 , the three-dimensional structures of ryGM-CSF and ApoA-I are spatially separated from each other, and thus, the function of both proteins in the chimera can be expected to be retained. E. coli clones bearing the target recombinant plasmids were selected both on selective LB agar medium containing 50 \u03bcg/mL zeocin and by PCR of colonies with primers AOX1-F and AOX1-R used for the detection and sequencing of genes cloned into the pPICZ\u03b1A plasmid. The sizes of the amplicons were determined by electrophoresis in 0.8% agarose gel stained with ethidium bromide. Selected clones containing pPICZ\u03b1A/ryGM-CSF or pPICZ\u03b1A/ryGM-CSF-link-ApoA-I plasmids were used for their preparative isolation and subsequent cloning in P. pastoris X33 cells.",

At the same time, these cells were not observed in the presence of a chimeric cytokine. The chimera well supported the viability of the reticular-stromal system of the bone marrow. This effect may have been due to the presence of ApoA-I in the chimera ( Figure S3 ).

Both factors normalized granulocytopoiesis, reducing the number of hyposegmented neutrophils and increasing the total number of cells of the granulocyte series while maintaining the number of blast forms. Furthermore, the proliferative activity of the cells in the presence of the chimera was higher, and the apoptotic death was lower than in the case of ryGM-CSF, which contributed to an increase in the total number of cells.

It is possible that the additive effect of the ApoA-I protein and the growth factor GM-CSF in the chimera will manifest itself in models of alveolar macrophages. It has recently been suggested that GM-CSF is required for the clearance of cholesterol from alveolar macrophages, with a decrease in this clearance being a major macrophage defect leading to pulmonary alveolar proteinosis [60] . The importance of ApoA-I for the reverse transport of cholesterol and its anti-inflammatory role in pulmonary disease has been noted in studies [61, 62] . There is more and more evidence in the literature indicating the role of ApoA-I in the pathogenesis and severity of lung disease: ApoA-I mimetic peptides have been found to be useful in the treatment of lung diseases such as viral pneumonia [63] , pulmonary hypertension [64] , asthma [65] , and acute respiratory distress syndrome [66] .",

            "text": "At the same time, ryGM-CSF-ApoA-I increased the viability of the total amount of BMC and reduced apoptotic cell death more efficiently than ryGM-CSF. The chimeric form normalized the proliferation, maturation, and segmentation of neutrophils within the physiological norm, preserving the pool of blast cells under conditions of impaired granulopoiesis. These results indicate the modulating effect of ApoA-I in the composition of the chimera on the biological activity of GM-CSF and the advisability of a more in-depth study of the properties of the chimeric cytokine.",

Figure S3 : Human BMCs treated with ryGM-CSF-ApoA-I (B) and ryGM-CSF (C) versus control (A) for 48 h of incubation. The control is observed: Immature hyposegmented neutrophils, increased apoptosis, phagocytosis, increased number of monocytes. Samples treated with ryGM-CSF-ApoA-I-mature neutrophils, viable intact stroma, blast cells. Samples treated with ryGM-CSF-mature neutrophils with less condensed chromatin, monocytes, macrophages, eosinophils and erythroid blasts, apoptosis. ",
