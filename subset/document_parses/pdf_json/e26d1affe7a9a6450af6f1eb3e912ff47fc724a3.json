During the COVID-19 period, the use of telemedicine and remote counselling has made great strides. This has helped in reducing the number of outpatients and unnecessary physical contacts. Tolone et al. used triage questionnaires for elective surgical patients in cases of positive symptoms and contact history associated with COVID-19. These questionnaires were administered through the telephone [11] . Gambardella et al. reported their experience regarding treatment for old cancer patients. They documented several procedures that could help in preventing disease transmission among patients. These procedures encompassed the use of a telephone triage before admission, and the application of telemedicine [12] . In CG, appointments and triage protocols were to be performed virtually through telemedicine Successful implementation of infection control measures require the strict management of inpatients during this period. Patients with cancers have been established to be immunocompromised, which makes them more susceptible to COVID-19 [4, 10] . Therefore, we suggest that all outpatients should be triaged before admission to reduce the possibility of exposure in hospital. In CG, to screen for suspected infections, patients were subjected to chest CT scans and new coronavirus nucleic acid tests before admission, which explains the longer waiting time before admission in CG. In addition, the provinces were relatively isolated during the pandemic, therefore, compared with PCG, the proportion of local patients in CG had increased.",

If the fever was lower than 37.3\u00b0C or other symptoms associated with pneumonia were absent after 3 days of admission, surgical procedures would then be performed. The waiting time before surgery was, therefore, longer. During the pandemic, routine surgical techniques should be based on the principles of safety and efficiency, with the main purpose of reducing the incidences of postoperative complications while accelerating the patient's recovery and discharge [13] [14] [15] . It was necessary to avoid performing surgical procedures beyond During COVID-19 period, more laparoscopic surgeries were performed. COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through respiratory droplets, but the risk of COVID-19 transmission is greatly increased during aerosol generation procedure (AGP) in laparoscopic surgery [16] . Compared with open surgery, there are concerns that the leaked CO 2 and smoke may lead to the generation of COVID-19 contaminated aerosols, which may be due to the application of ultrasonic surgical instruments, low gas motility of pneumoperitoneum, and gas expulsion through trocars or ports [17] . Therefore, The Intercollegiate General Surgery Guidance on COVID-19 and The Society of Gastrointestinal and Endoscopic Surgeons (SAGES) initially highlighted the risk of aerosolization during laparoscopic surgery, although their updated guidance acknowledged a lack of evidence [18, 19] .",

Moreover, there was less evidence that had shown relationship between COVID-19 transmission and surgical smoke generated by ultrasonic surgical instruments [20] [21] [22] [23] . By the way, during the COVID-19 pandemic, we also use the smoke extractor with vacuum motors which were applied to inhale smoke from the surgical site through a completely enclosed vacuum tube and filter. Medical staffs were therefore protected from potential contamination. Therefore, we have used laparoscopy more frequently during COVID-19, and information about laparoscopic surgeries, such as surgery time, blood loss and complications, indicated that the method was safe and feasible. However, although we have not found any evidence of particular risk in laparoscopic surgery, the risk might still exist. Further investigation in this field is of critical importance. The hospitalization costs were significantly increased in CG. As for the reason, we would like to elaborate on prolonged hospital stay. Patients in CG were observed in the separate single-room wards for 3 days to prevent potential infection. Therefore, the preoperative hospital stay was longer. As for the post-operative hospital stay, during the COVID-19 period, patients had to have their stitches removed in outpatient clinics and local hospitals after discharge. This increased the risk of unnecessary viral infections. It was better to stay longer in our department until stitches were removed. The hospital stay period after surgery was, therefore, longer in CG.",
