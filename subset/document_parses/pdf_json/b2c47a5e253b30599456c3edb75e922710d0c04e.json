            "text": "Prioritization of adaptation options is complex. This study presents a multi-dimensional framework to evaluate how to allocate resources among competing alternatives. The main objectives of the study were to identify the prioritized climate-smart agricultural practices adopted among smallholder farmers in different value chains across sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) and to assess the economic feasibility of the practices using Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA) to develop a portfolio of viable and cost-effective options. This study focused on selected five SSA countries and selected value chains. 153 smallholder farmers and stakeholders were interviewed. The Climate Smart Agriculture Prioritization Framework was applied for the assessment of economically viable adaptation options. The prioritization was based on standard ranks on the ability of the practice to improve productivity, increase resilience, and mitigation. Spearman's rank-order correlation was used to assess the independence of the ranks. A CBA was conducted as the final step. Smallholder farmers in the study areas prioritized the adoption of improved seed, good agricultural practices, and conservation agriculture practices. In the sweet potato value chain in Kenya, good agricultural practices was viable with an NPV of US$ 28,044, an IRR of 328%, and a one-year payback period. This is in comparison to the improved seed varieties (US$ 8,738, 111%, and two years payback period) respectively. In Nigeria, the most viable option was the improved seed in the potato value chain and good agricultural practices in the rice value chain. In Malawi, Ethiopia, and Zambia, the most viable practices were improved seed, and conservation agriculture in the soybean, faba beans, and peanut value chains respectively. The NPV was highly sensitive to changes in the discount rate, moderately to price, yield, and practice lifecycle, and least to changes in annual labour costs. The results elaborate on the most feasible adaptation practices that enable smallholder farmers to increase productivity and be economically efficient. The use of the CSA-PF consecutively with the CBA tool allows for the proper identification of best-bet CSA options.",

This is due to over-reliance on rainfed agricultural systems and low adaptive capacity attributed to high poverty incidences. Dube et al. (2016) estimated that yield from rain-fed agriculture could decrease by about 50% in the next 30-35 years if adaptation measures are not put in place. With the advent of climate change, if we continue with business as usual (BAU), rain-fed agricultural production systems may not be sustainable. Climate change adaptation through promoting the adoption of Climate-Smart Agriculture (CSA) practices is an effective policy recommendation to deal with the risks posed by climate change. CSA, as defined by the Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations (FAO) is an approach for developing agricultural strategies to secure sustainable food security under a changing climate (FAO et al., 2018) .",

Practices aimed at pest and weed management include the use of pesticides, new crop varieties or cultivars that are pest and disease resistant, adoption of push-pull technology, and crop diversification through intercropping or crop rotation (Agula et al., 2019) . Other practices include agroforestry and cover cropping, changing of planting dates, index-based insurance, and use of organic manure among others. All these are aimed at income diversification, risk management, and enhancing soil carbon, fertility, and infiltration capacities (Hansen et al., 2019) .",

These include high initial investment, input, and operational costs, limited access to technology and information, minimal gains over short periods, trade-offs between productivity, sustainability, and environmental protection, inadequate information on seasonal climate forecast trends, and inadequate coordination along agricultural value chains among others.

Prioritization of CSA practices is an essential component in decision-making analysis as it allows for consideration of local context-specific and system characteristics. For prioritization to be successful, a minimal dataset of economic yield, inputs used, the costs and benefits associated is required (Dunnett et al., 2018) . Prioritization helps in identifying, through suggested criteria, the importance that farmers place on a particular adaptation strategy. The criteria include the initial investment costs, the payback period, and the importance of the practice in increasing productivity. These are highly crop/strategy/country-specific. The prioritization process is robust and helps to identify the most important strategies that increase productivity and resilience for smallholder farmers as well as contribute to the mitigation of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from the agricultural sector.",

Most research on climate change stresses and adaptation strategies often lacks an economic feasibility test. This study sought to fill this knowledge gap by including a Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA) in the identification of appropriate CSA strategies. This was achieved through evaluating two objectives: (i) to identify the prioritized adaptation strategies among smallholders in the five SSA countries, and (ii) to assess the economic feasibility of the prioritized CSA practices using cost-benefit analysis. The Climate-Smart Agriculture Prioritization Framework (CSA-PF) was applied. CSA-PF is a multi-dimensional process. It provides a step-by-step methodology to identifying the main CSA practices and involves a ranking process to identify the prioritized ones. It also involves the assessment of the costs and benefits of the prioritized CSA practices as a final step of the process.",

Economic CBA considers both private profitability and the social and environmental effects (externalities). Economic CBA is ideal.

In the context of this study, data was collected within the first and second quarters of 2020, a period when most countries around the world were under lockdown and strict travel restrictions due to the emergence and rapid spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. The use of online surveys, though with the disadvantage of having sampling issues and lower response rates, especially in the agricultural sector where most researchers often rely on face-to-face contact with the farmer or farmer groups presented an opportunity that enabled access to relevant information from key informants at a lower cost and within a shorter period. Upadhyay and Lipkovich (2020) opined that the use of online interviews could help achieve a diverse sample of participants. With the current status of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is becoming increasingly urgent to refine the use of remote research methods. Although using online interviews is a marginalized method for data collection, it has the potential of eliminating time and space boundaries, reducing research costs, and encouraging an iterative reflection where both the participant and researcher can keenly reflect on the questions and provide thoughtful answers (Bowden and Galindo-gonzalez, 2015) . To overcome the limitations associated with online interviews, the participants were actively engaged with the help of GIC experts in each region and were informed before to build a good rapport. The participants were also informed of the project time frame and reminders were sent about answering the interview questions.",

In a study conducted in the Bihar district of South Asia, Shirsath et al.

The prioritized innovations from the study included the use of GAPs such as alternate wetting drying in rice cultivation, index-based insurance, conservation practices such as reduced tillage, and farm-level water management. The application of different frameworks and methodologies in the prioritization of climate adaptation strategies allows for diversity in portfolio development and management (Mwongera et al., 2017; Khatri-Chhetri et al., 2017; Shirsath et al., 2017) .",

The discount rate used in most countries was 10% except for Malawi and Ethiopia where the discount rates were 13.5% and 12% respectively.

The payback period, which is the time it takes for the practice to fully repay its initial capital, varied between one and two years for most of the practices (Table 5 ).

Improved seed varieties in the sweet potato value had the lowest IRR (111%) while CA in the soybean value chain in Malawi had the highest IRR (493%). The difference in the IRR between the two practices could be attributed to the varying cash flow patterns given that conservation agriculture within the same value chain presented the lowest NPV (US$508) (Table 5) . CA, for instance, had a very low initial capital investment (US$26).

The shadow price was used as a proxy for the market price to indicate the value the society is willing to pay or the value NB: r \u00bc discount rate at which the NPV has been discounted, IRR \u00bc internal rate of return, T \u00bc practice life cycle, PP \u00bc practice payback period, GAP-Good Agricultural Practices, CA-Conservation Agriculture. they are willing to receive for an extra unit of the eternality.

A biodiversity index is used to estimate the complexity, stability, and general health of an ecosystem. It is calculated by dividing the number of species in an area by the total number of individuals in the area. Thus the closer the index is to 1 the more diverse the ecosystem. Williams et al. (2020) used soil fertility as a proxy for soil and crop biodiversity. In this case, an increase in soil fertility increased plant species per unit area thus increase in crop biodiversity. The use of organic manure to increase soil fertility resulted in improvement in below-ground soil activity. In estimating the effect on biodiversity, the soil fertility per hectare was estimated by the product of the change in N gained by the shadow price. Ng 'ang'a et al.

Water quality improvements associated with agroforestry systems such as hedgerows were estimated at a total of USD 514 depending on the area covered. Conservation tillage with mulch was valued at USD 90 (Sain et al., 2017) . CSA practices have the potential for improving the environment and rural livelihood. Table 6 presents the social impact or externality of adopting the CSA strategies evaluated by the effect on change in labour requirement. In this case, survey data collected for the CBA was used in the assessment with the assumption that the implementation and maintenance of the CSA in the five countries for the selected value chains required the use of additional labour. The change in the labour requirement was then multiplied by the corresponding market price of labour which was country-specific to obtain the change in the value of labour (Table 6) . High labour requirements for the CSA practices were applied during the harvesting and threshing. In resource-constrained households, the high demand was supplemented by family labour which presents a trade-off against engaging in other off-farm activities.",

Results show that NPV was most sensitive to any small changes in the yield variable compared to the other variables as evidenced by the small difference between the base value and switching value. The least sensitive variable was the annual labour cost as seen by the huge difference. In some cases, such as the improved seed varieties in the potato value chain in Nigeria and soybean in Zambia, the labour presented no value (low or high) that could give an NPV of zero. Changing one variable at a time helps to assess how risky the project is and which variables significantly affect the NPV. It also helps to determine variables that are crucial to the robustness of the NPV. For example, if varying a variable like a yield has a large effect on the NPV, then the uncertainty about its value now and in the future becomes important. The policy should therefore be developed and implemented to ensure yield growth and stability. Each bar represented in Figures 3a and 3b indicates a percentage change in value per hectare of the corresponding variable. A change in the discount rate resulted in a decrease of the NPV to US$ (5,616). These are also replicable in all the value chains with different variations in the values (Figure 3b ). The findings imply that with higher discount rates, low yield, and lower prices, the profitability for all the practices will be lower. In contrast, profitability will be higher if we consider lower discount rates and lower annual labour costs.",

Other scientists argue that very low discount rates may lead to misallocation of private resources and a misguided value of future benefits of a project (Mendelsohn, 2012) .

Considering the opinions of all stakeholders along the value chains through the prioritization process provides key insights on how to properly implement adaptation practices at the farm level. The study also gives comprehensive CBA results considering not only the net present value and the internal rate of return as conventionally used but also shows the payback period, the benefit-cost ratios, and sensitivity analysis.
