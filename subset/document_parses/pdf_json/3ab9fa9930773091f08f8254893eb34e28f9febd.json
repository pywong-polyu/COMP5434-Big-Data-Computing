However, challenges still emerge at the interface of upstream and downstream processes, integral to the value chain. It is now clear that biofoundries have a key role to play in addressing this; they provide unique and accessible infrastructure to drive the standardization necessary to deliver systematic design and engineering of biological systems and workflows. As for other biofoundries, the success of the London Biofoundry has been in part due to its expertise in establishing channels for industrial translation through its extensive strategic collaborations. It has also become cemented as a key component of various consortia and partnerships that serve the broader bioeconomy and industrial strategies. Adopting a networked approach enables links to be made between infrastructure, researchers, industrialists and policy makers to de-risk the economic challenges of scale-up, as well as contribute to the growing bioeconomy.",

Much of the current synthetic biology activities are focused on the rapid prototyping of biosystems to deliver novel solutions to worldwide grand challenges (3) . The widespread establishment of a community of biofoundries is seen as the enabler for accelerating these endeavors. Biofoundries offer a unique opportunity to harness the power of constructing biology with new process systems and automated workflows (4) . At the London Biofoundry (LBF), we have focused on early-stage technology readiness levels where, through responsible innovation, we have identified new materials, sustainable products, and novel technologies that are currently being developed (5) . These all have the potential to revolutionize sustainable biomanufacturing -realizing the applications of synthetic biology necessitates the continued development of enabling technologies, with the polices and praxes to ensure these are accessible to the research community.",

Various biofoundries are developing a complete synthetic biology technology stack to deliver complex bio-design projects that are vertically integrated. Highly efficient automated manufacturing platforms, including robotic liquid-handling equipment coupled with computer-aided design software, enable enhanced high-throughput analyses. Through such processes, biofoundries are underpinning reproducibility and enabling the quantitative precision required for modern biomanufacturing (3) (4) (5) . A large scope of the bio-design space is also being exploited by machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) approaches, whereby large-scale high-quality data as well as proper experimental design are fundamental to the leverage of ML. We are quickly recognizing that historical biological data does not always meet the requirements for ML to be effective (including a lack of standardized data measurement and annotation), so it is important that new data are collected and aggregated with these needs in mind. However, a major challenge that still exists for researchers and biofoundries is the enablement of high-throughput analytics and omics measurements, to provide the data required to feed ML and statistical learning approaches. This current bottleneck is preventing the full adoption of these approaches for bio-design and the DBTL cycle although many biofoundries are working to address this.",

The LBF infrastructure has facilitated a more porous interface between industry and academia, with collaborative engagements from both sides leading to an enhanced understanding of the value each can bring to one another (see Figure 1 ). The LBF and other biofoundries nationally and worldwide are also leveraging upon the progressive cultural change in academia that is recognizing the value of innovation and entrepreneurial activity at a curriculum level. For example, many undergraduate students are now taught entrepreneurship modules and are actively encouraged to engage in commercialization of their ideas through multiple competitions, workshops and hackathons (8).",

Purposeful infrastructure integration is commonplace, another example being the Earlham Biofoundry (11) . Located within the Norwich Research Park, the Earlham Institute has access to a thriving community of businesses, researchers and clinicians. Many of the early-stage companies are working on a wide variety of biotechnology projects, often emerging as university start-ups that are encountering the financial and logistical realities of running a technology company. Biofoundry infrastructure allows many of these micro-companies to rapidly evaluate their new ideas and biotechnology designs and obtain robust experimental data to de-risk uncertainty in their investment process ( Figure 1 ). Our own experiences of working with companies, ranging from early-stage start-ups to large tier 1 corporations and pharmaceutical companies, have allowed the development of new workflows, which can be reused to support proof-of-concept and larger scale R&D projects. Many publicfunded biofoundries, including the LBF, Earlham Agile, and Edinburgh Genome Foundry (EGF), market their technical services as well as educational tools such as workshops, conferences, training courses and webinars. These activities have assisted many companies to determine how biofoundry infrastructure can facilitate their own innovation and R&D pipelines. The US-based Agile Biofoundries act at the interface of academia and industry (gray horizontal arrows) and tap into a large array of participants and resources that contribute to ongoing technology translation and innovation in synthetic biology/biotechnology. By facilitating infrastructure access to a variety of spinouts/start-ups, SMEs and industry across the synthetic biology landscape, biofoundries create value to the innovation ecosystem. Biofoundries also provide connectivity between new synthetic biology companies with venture capitalists and private investors as well as government and policy makers (gray vertical arrows). Due to the disruptive nature of synthetic biology technologies, biofoundries also provide a focus for dialogs with other stakeholders including international policy and governance organizations (e.g. Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and United Nations Convention on Biodiversity (UN-CBD)) and Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs).",

These areas are not widely available in public-funded biofoundries, and these gaps need to be filled quickly. One exception is the US Agile Biofoundry, where the economic feasibility of new biotechnology processes can be assessed as part of their infrastructure offering (12) . A widespread use of biofoundries for strain engineering, involving genetic design and DNA construction, is also allowing improved standardization for these foundational technologies (21, 22) .",

This partnership is a good example of how biofoundries can help health services around the world develop low-cost reagentagnostic open testing platforms for other infectious diseases. The LBF has extended its COVID response to include new workflows for sample pooling that can be implemented in frontline testing, as well as High-Throughput (HTP) Sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 viral variants (28) .

In publicly funded businessled research partnerships, biofoundries are able to accelerate technology readiness levels of academic research programs and deliver economic, social and cultural prosperity. However, to enable such partnerships, biofoundries also need to be sustainable. In our experience, the key to medium-and long-term sustainability is the creation of a core client base of academics and industry. This can be via strategic partnerships combined with a flexible 'fee-for-service' model to deliver a variety of proofof-concept projects or collaborative research grants where costs for accessing the biofoundry infrastructure are included. Evaluation of the potential client base should extend beyond the host institute's ecosystem and embrace the broader national and international research communities. While these strategies require significant community engagement, they can also lead to the identification of additional funding sources and alternative funding models. For example, in the UK, the Innovate UK Smart Grant scheme, EPSRC Prosperity Partnerships and direct Venture Capital injection (30) .

We envisage a seamless interface between cloud-based upstream prototyping activities within our biofoundry community and downstream industrial biomanufacturing. In this scenario, biofoundries can be considered as a joint infrastructure investment, where many research institutions and other stakeholder can combine their skills and funding assets.",
