How and when to ease restrictions to movement hinges in part on whether SARS-CoV2 will display seasonality due to variations in temperature, humidity, and hours of sunshine. Here, we address this question by means of a spatio-temporal analysis in Spain of the incidence of COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus. Use of spatial Seemingly Unrelated Regressions (SUR) allows us to model the incidence of reported cases of the disease per 100,000 population as an interregional contagion process, in addition to a function of temperature, humidity, and sunshine. In the analysis we also control for GDP per capita, percentage of older adults in the population, population density, and presence of mass transit systems. The results support the hypothesis that incidence of the disease is lower at higher temperatures and higher levels of humidity. Sunshine, in contrast, displays a positive association with incidence of the disease. Our control variables also yield interesting insights.

In reference to the earlier outbreak of SARS, Van Wagner (2008) chronicles how Toronto's status as a global city turned out to be a vulnerability in this respect. In our case, we think of GDP per capita as a marker of a region's relative position in a network of global cities, and its potential to be further ahead in the trajectory of the pandemic. Furthermore, wealthier regions also tend to concentrate more activities that produce non-traded goods, including building and construction (Hallet 2002) . Therefore, it is possible that wealthier regions remain relatively more active even during a lockdown.

Early evidence regarding COVID-19 suggests that the case rate mortality is higher at older ages (e.g., The Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia Emergency Response Epidemiology Team 2020). However, it is not clear that a relatively large population of older adults necessarily translates into higher transmission rates of the infection. The tool of choice in containing the spread of the disease has been social distancing. In this respect, the evidence from the field of transportation is that older adults tend to travel less frequently, for shorter distances, and have higher rates of immobility than most everyone, except the youngest members of the public (e.g., Roorda et al. 2010; Morency et al. 2011; Sikder and Pinjari 2012) . In other words, many older adults are, whether by preference or otherwise, already in a form of social isolation. Social distancing during the pandemic may actually reinforce that condition for them, as suggested by the analysis of age-structured social contact in India, China, and Italy of Singh and Adhikari (2020).

This declaration marked a turning point for the public in Spain too.

Lauer et al. (2020) report for the case of COVID-19 a median incubation period of 5.7 days (with a confidence interval between 4.9 to 7.8 days). The vast majority of cases (95%) develop symptoms between 2.6 days (CI, 2.1 to 3.7 days) and 12.5 days (CI, 8.2 to 17.7 days). For this reason, we judge it best to use lagged values of the environmental variables. We test different time lags as follows. We consider a lagged 8-day average, from date-minus-12 to date-minus-5 days (hereafter lag8). Secondly, we consider a lagged 11-day average, from date-minus-12 to date-minus-2 days (hereafter lag11). Finally, to account for the likely duration of incubation, we consider a lagged 11-day weighted average, from date-minus-12 to date-minus-2 days (hereafter lag11w). The weights for this variable are calculated using the parameters of the log-normal distribution reported by Lauer et al. (2020) , that is, a log-mean of 1.621 and a log-standard deviation of 0.418. With these weights, the environmental variables at date-minus-2 and date-minus-12 days are weighted as 0.041 and 0.009 respectively, whereas the environmental variables at date-minus-5 days are weighted as 0.194. These weights have the effect of changing the contribution of daily values to the lagged moving average.

It is well-known that coefficients in linear regression models are partial derivatives of the dependent variable with respect to the independent variables, and therefore directly give the marginal effects or rates of change. Spatially lagged models, however, are no longer linear. The intuition behind the non-linearity is that the spatial lag expands the information set to include information from neighbouring regions: in other words, the value of an explanatory variable in a spatial unit can have influence in other spatial units via the spatial lag. This makes interpretation of the coefficients less straightforward but also richer (Golgher and Voss 2016) . The results of LeSage and Pace (2009) for cross-sectional spatial lag models can be extended to the spatial SUR framework. Note that, according to Elhorst (2014) , the partial derivatives have the following interpretation: if an explanatory variable (X k ) in a particular province changes, not only the incidence rate in that province changes, also incidence rates in other provinces change via the contagion effect. Therefore, a change in X k in a particular province has a direct effect on that province, but also an indirect effect on neighbouring provinces.

Likewise, a global indicator of the indirect effects is calculated as the mean of the non-diagonal elements. The total effect is the sum of direct and indirect effects. Finally, note that if \u03c1 k = 0, the indirect effects are 0 and the direct effects are equal to \u03b2 k t. Fig. 1 shows the geographical variation in the incidence of COVID-19 in Spain, as well as the temporal progression of the disease in weekly averages. Our analysis begins on March 13. Albeit still low, the highest incidence at this early date was in the provice of \u00c1lava, in the North of Spain. \u00c1lava is not the most populous province, with a population of only 331,549, but it has the highest GDP per capita of all provinces. Vitoria, its main city, is the capital of the Basque Country and has been the focus of efforts, along with San Sebastian and Bilbao, to develop a \"Global Basque City\" (Meijers, Hoekstra, and Aguado 2008) . The other early focus of the pandemic in Spain was Madrid, which is the most populous province in the country and has the second highest GDP per capita after \u00c1lava. The early outbreaks in these two provinces can be traced throughout the progression of the pandemic over time, although by the end of the period under study, other provinces had matched and even surpased their incidence rates, including Segovia and Soria to the north of Madrid, and Ciudad Real and Albacete to the south. Fig. 2 shows the distribution of the environmental variables in Spain. For ease of visualization we aggregate the provinces by Autonomous Community. Each box-and-whisker in the figure represents the distribution of the variable for a community over the 30-day period. In the plot, the communities have been sorted by latitude, so that Principado de Asturias is the northernmost community, and Andalucia the southernmost. As seen in the figure, there is a relatively wide range of values both within and between provinces over the 30-day period examined. The top panel of the figure shows the distribution of mean temperatures. The lowest mean temperature for a community on any given day was approximately 3 \u2022 C, and the highest about 20 \u2022 C, for a range of approximately 17 \u2022 . Likewise, there is a great deal of variability in humidity, as seen in the middle panel of the figure, where the lowest mean humidity for any community is approximately 48% and the highest is close to 100%. Finally, the bottom panel displays mean daily hours of sunshine in the community. This variable displays the most variability within communities over time, but remains relatively constant across communities. It is important to note that these are summaries by community, and the actual values of these variables for the provinces display somewhat more variability. Fig. 3 includes three maps that display the spatial variation of our control variables, namely GDP per capita, percentage of older adults in province, population density, and presence of mass transit systems. As seen there, GDP per capita is higher in Madrid and the northeast part of the country, mainly in Pais Vasco and Catalu\u00f1a. Percentage of older adults is somewhat more checkered, with high values in Madrid and other provinces in the center-west part of the country, but also in some provinces in the north. Outside of provinces with major cities (e.g., Madrid; Bizkaia and Gipuzkoa in Pais Vasco; Pontevedra in Galicia), population density tends to be higher in provinces along the Mediterranean coast. The final panel in the figure shows the five provinces in the country that have higher order mass transit systems (e.g., metro). Fig. 4 shows the distribution of daily simple correlations of incidence of COVID-19 with the independent variables (with the exception of Transit, which is a categorical variable).

The general trend is identical for the three models, with the goodness-of-fit improving over time and plateuing around a value of R 2 of 0.55.

Model 3 (lag11w), in contrast, does not perform well towards the end of the study period. The most balanced model in terms of equation-level goodness-of-fit appears to be Model 1 (lag8), and this impression is further supported by a slightly higher value of the pooled-R 2 . The analysis using a lagged moving average of the environmental variables is generally in line with the incubation period reported by Lauer et al.

In the following section we discuss the results of the analysis in more depth. Table 2 presents a summary of the results of Model 1 (lag8). Recall that two coefficients were constrained and are estimated only for the first equation of the system, and thus are assumed to be constant over time. These are the coefficients corresponding to GDP per capita (P \u2264 0.10) and percentage of older adults (P \u2264 0.05). The sign of the coefficient for GDP per capita is positive, which indicates that wealthier regions tend to have a higher incidence of COVID-19. This is in line with the idea that the epidemic started earlier in wealthier places due to their connections to a globalized world. The sign of the coefficient for percentage of older adults, on the other hand, is negative. As previously discussed, the level of social contact of older adults even under normal circumstances tends to be lower than for younger people. As a consequence, places with larger populations of older adults appear to have a natural level of social distancing in place. It is important to note that this does not detract from evidence that older adults are more vulnerable individually and in institutional settings, where their case mortality rates are perhaps the highest of all age groups.

Keeping in mind that the incubation period ranges between 2 and 12 days with a median of 5, it is reasonable to expect that the effect of the lockdown will be observed with some delay. Indeed, as seen in the figure, the autocorrelation coefficient remains high for several days, then begins to decline around March 23, and continues to weaken over time.

For example, the analysis does not imply that the virus moves less effectively in places where more people live in close proximity to each other, but rather that humans are more contagious when they feel safe in less dense regions. Similarly, more sunshine does not mean that the virus thrives, but rather that humans are more contagious to each other when their behavior adapts to this environmental condition.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Concluding remarks"}, {"text": "Some directions for future research include investigating other modelling frameworks, such as geographically and temporally weighted regression and/or space-time conditional autoregressive models.
