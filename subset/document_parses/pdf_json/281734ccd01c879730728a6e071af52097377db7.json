            "text": "Background: Facial skin care (FSC) is an important routine for Japanese women. Hand motions during FSC physically affect psychological state. However, it is very difficult to evaluate hand motions during personal and complex FSC. The objective of this study was to find out objective and quantitative parameters for hand motions during facial skin care (FSC). Women who enjoy and soothe during FSC (Enjoyment group (E group), n = 20) or not (non-enjoyment group (NE group), n = 19) were recruited by an advance questionnaire. The same lotion, emulsion, and cream were provided to all subjects, and they used sequentially in the same way as the women's daily FSC. The motion of the marker on the back side of the right middle finger during FSC was tracked by a motion capture system. The heart rate variability (HRV) was also measured before and after FSC for evaluating psychological effect.",

ACC), approximate entropy (ApEn), and power law scaling exponent (Rest \u03b3) of the cumulative duration of slow motion from the sequential data of acceleration were evaluated. Compared to the NE group, the E group showed a lower Avg. ACC when using emulsion (p = 0.005) and cream (p = 0.007), a lower ApEn when using emulsion (p = 0.003), and a lower Rest \u03b3 (p = 0.024) when using all items, suggesting that compared to the NE group, the E group had more tender and regular motion, and sustainable slow motions, especially in the use of emulsion. In the E group, the low/highfrequency component of HRV decreased significantly after FSC, suggesting suppression of sympathetic activity (p = 0.045). NE group did not. For all subjects, ApEn and Rest \u03b3 showed significantly positive correlation with the increase in the low/high-frequency component of HRV after FSC (p < 0.01). ApEn showed significantly negative correlation with the increase in the high-frequency component of HRV after FSC (p < 0.05). Avg. ACC did not show significant correlation with them. These results suggested that the behavior of FSC influences the autonomic nerve system. Conclusions: ApEn and Rest \u03b3 are useful parameters for evaluating quality of hand motions during FSC.",

FSC of Japanese woman has also been reported to influence autonomic nerve system (ANS) activity [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] .

ApEn can be used to evaluate the complexity of information, even for discrete data with finite length [10, 12] . ApEn is smaller in the case of more regular sequenced data. Pincus et al. reported on the risk of sudden infant death syndrome by ApEn using electrocardiogram data [13] , while Arif et al. evaluated the change in the stability of walking with aging by ApEn [14] . On the other hand, Nakamura et al. proposed Rest \u03b3 as an appropriate living activity index [11] ; they binarized sequenced acceleration data, recorded by a locomotor, with the averaged value; from this, the logarithm of the cumulative duration and frequency from sequenced data of the duration of motions smaller than the average value was calculated, and the slope taken as the Rest \u03b3 value. Furthermore, they reported that Rest \u03b3 indicated qualitative differences in the living activities between healthy and depressed individuals [15] .",

Self-facial massage of Japanese women stimulates the parasympathetic nerve, suggesting a relaxation effect [3, [5] [6] [7] . Daily FSC may have the ability to control ANS unconsciously. In these studies, ANS activity is evaluated by heart rate variability (HRV) [21] . HRV, the cardiovascular signal variability of the R-R period, is a commonly adopted marker of cardiac ANS activity, which is both reliable and non-invasive [21] . The frequency of HRV has been analyzed using methods such as fast Fourier transform (an autoregressive model) and maximum entropy methods (MEMs). When the power is separated between high frequency (HF; 0.15-0.45 Hz) and low frequency (LF; 0.04-0.15 Hz) in spectral analysis, the HF reflects the activity of the parasympathetic nervous system and the LF reflects the activities of both the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system [22] . The ratio of LF and HF (L/H) can therefore be used as an index of sympathetic nervous system activity [23] . The change of HRV is also closely related to emotional change [24] [25] [26] .",

Subjects used all three items (lotion, emulsion, cream) every day for skin care. Subjects were selected and classed into two groups by the advance questionnaire. The advance questionnaire had two questions: \"Do you enjoy during daily FSC?\" and \"Do you soothe during daily FSC?\". Female answering \"Yes\" and \"No\" to both were classed into enjoyment group (E group, n = 20; averaged age, 40 \u00b1 4) and non-enjoyment group (NE group, n = 19; averaged age, 41 \u00b1 5), respectively. The difference in the age of both groups was not significant (p = 0.470). There was no significant difference in subjective skin care time between the two groups (E group, 7.6 \u00b1 3.0 min; NE group, 7.4 \u00b1 3.2 min, p = 0.860).

When using the lotion to the emulsion, the E group had a reduced ApEn compared to the NE group. Other two parameters did not show significant change between items. ApEn has been applied in the field of not only neurology [37] and endocrinology [38] , but also motion analysis [39] . A lower ApEn indicates a more regular behavior, while higher ApEn values indicate more complex and unpredictable one [32, 40] . In this study, the E group has more regular behaviors than the NE group when using the emulsion. Alkjaer et al. demonstrated a higher ApEn of the ankle joint angle when walking in high heels compared to walking barefoot, suggesting a variable adjusting strategy of the nervous system to control the ankle joint [41] . In the context of FSC, differences in the physical property of the emulsion or skin may influence the hand motion; it is certainly known that changes in the physical properties of the object affect the hand motion [42, 43] . However, factors affecting hand motion are more complex due to the context such as purpose [44] and prior knowledge [45] . We must consider further in detail.",

The averaged Rest \u03b3 value (emulsion) of the E group and NE group is \u2212 0.834 \u00b1 0.181 and \u2212 0.975 \u00b1 0.128, respectively (p = 0.012). The Rest \u03b3 of the NE group is similar to the value, 1.0, of the life activity of healthy people and mice [34, 35] . It is possible that the motion of the NE group is similar to an unconstrained motion without defect and consciousness.

There are some reports demonstrating that FSC provides a relaxing effect as a result of the stimulation of the parasympathetic nerve of the heart [3, 5, 7] . It is interesting that the effects of FSC on ANS activity are different in both groups. It is suggested that FSC of the E group has an inhibitory effect on the sympathetic nerve system (lower ccv(LF/HF)) and that FSC of the NE group has an inhibitory effect on the parasympathetic nerve system (lower ccv (HF)). In this study, the NE group may have trouble carrying out the routine and/or feel stressed when using items during daily FSC. In fact, Okada also suggested that the sympathetic nerve system is stimulated by self-FSC in the case of females with negative attitudes towards FSC [3] . These points require further study.",

High ApEn correlated with an increase in sympathetic nerve system activity and a decrease in parasympathetic nerve system activity. These data suggest that more regular (lower ApEn) motion and longer duration of slow motion (lower Rest \u03b3) may lower the balance of ANS activity (sympathetic/parasympathetic nerve system activity). In general, exercise greatly affects the activity of sympathetic nerve system, but it is also known that static stretching activates the parasympathetic nerve system [46, 47] . In this study, the relationship between the acceleration of hand motion and the change of ANS activity is not confirmed, suggesting quality of hand motion but not the intensity of one may affect the balance of ANS activity in the case of FSC. FSC behavior consists of various movement units such as application, tapping, massage, and hand press. In the future, the relationship between each action and ApEn and Rest \u03b3 should be examined in detail. It will lead to constitutive understanding of FSC behavior. Feed-back system to user by monitoring ApEn and Rest \u03b3 of hand motion during FSC may bring to expand psychological potential for the balance of ANS activity in future.",
