When the coronavirus began to rapidly spread in Louisiana (LA) we responded to state and regional concerns about lack of rapid, reliable testing in many rural parishes in our area. We partnered with rural primary care clinics to rapidly provide trusted testing and timely return of results. Louisiana State University Health System-Shreveport (LSUHS-S) has a concentration of expertise in molecular analysis, as well as equipment and facilities suitable for adapting to responses to new pathogens. We developed viral tests, independent of major supply chains, and had access to adequate supplies, enabling us to make testing kits. Our partnership with rural Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs) allowed more rapid and reliable COVID-19 testing in isolated rural communities. FQHCs are community-based health centers that provide primary care in underserved areas to our nation's most vulnerable populations. One in 5 rural residents and 1 in 3 individuals living in poverty receive care at FQHCs. As states relax social distancing restrictions implemented due to COVID-19, these partnerships can also facilitate rural participation in clinical trials for antibody testing and vaccines.",

The EVT lab was designed to address the need for fast robust detection of COVID-19 cases and rapid processing of COVID-19 tests. LSUHS-S has an unusually high number of world-class virologists, therefore the human and intellectual resources needed to create a lab were already present. In addition to providing rapid detection of COVID-19 cases, the EVT lab developed the infrastructure necessary to assemble testing kits. This ability to assemble and distribute testing kits in substantial numbers eliminated one common barrier in rural areas of scarcity of testing supplies.",

They called clinic administrators and medical directors to discuss screening needs and interest in utilizing the new EVT lab's capacity to provide testing services and clinical research nurses trained to obtain nasopharyngeal swabs from patients. Our mobile community outreach mammography screening van was repurposed to facilitate testing outreach. The van transported testing kits and nurses to collect and transport COVID-19 testing. The mobile mammography program director and staff had a long history of providing cancer screening outreach to these same community clinics, which enhanced the brisk implementation and community trust of the mobile testing effort. The mobile outreach approach was appealing to the clinics, as the van provided visible public relations and promotion of the partnerships. The testing events, which usually lasted 2-4 hours, allowed patients to stay in their vehicles for registration and testing. Arrangements were also made to allow for walk-up patients who did not have a vehicle, further enhancing accessibility.",

The collaborative plan included advertising, prescreening patients, traffic management and security, collection of specimens, and distribution of test results. The FQHCs handled advertising and prescreening patients. They coordinated with local officials to determine the time, date, and location of each COVID-19 mobile testing event and to provide traffic management and safety. Each clinic advertised through local media, social media, and flyers. The clinics created short registration and consent forms, and clinic providers or medical assistants prescreened patients to confirm eligibility for testing according to CDC guidelines. The clinic providers placed the order for the test for each patient, and the results were sent back to each clinic which subsequently notified patients of their results. In cases where an individual did not have a primary care provider, the FQHC agreed to be the provider of record, order the test, receive the results, and notify the patient.",

It had step-by-step instructions on how to self-quarantine if needed, when to call their healthcare provider or 911 and reinforced basic safety steps to prevent the spread of COVID-19.

The majority of patients tested (69.6%) were female. Nine (2.1%) of the individuals screened had a positive test result and have been followed-up by their FQHC primary care provider.",
