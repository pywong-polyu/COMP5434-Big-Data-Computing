We need to establish a practical method to improve the efficiency of treatment and optimize the allocation of medical resources. Due to the influx of a large number of patients into the hospital and the running of medical resources, blood routine test became the only possible check while COVID-19 patients first go to a fever clinic in a community hospital. This study aims to establish an efficient method to identify key indicators from initial blood routine test results for COVID-19 severity prediction. We determined that age is a key indicator for severity predicting of COVID-19, with an accuracy of 0.77 and an AUC of 0.92. In order to improve the accuracy of prediction, we proposed a Multi Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) algorithm, which combines the Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) and Na\u00efve Bayes (NB) classifier, to further select effective indicators from patients' initial blood test results. The MCDM algorithm selected 3 dominant feature subsets: {Age, WBC, LYMC, NEUT} with a selection rate of 44%, {Age, NEUT, LYMC} with a selection rate of 38%, and {Age, WBC, LYMC} with a selection rate of 9%. Using these feature subsets, the optimized prediction model could achieve an accuracy of 0.82 and an AUC of 0.93. These results indicated that Age, WBC, LYMC, NEUT were the key factors for COVID-19 severity prediction. Using age and the indicators selected by the MCDM algorithm from initial blood routine test results can effectively predict the severity of COVID-19. Our research could not only help medical workers identify patients with severe COVID-19 at an early stage, but also help doctors understand the pathogenesis of COVID-19 through key indicators.",

            "text": "Although most COVID-19 patients are Mild-Moderate cases and can recover on their own, about 14% of patients are Severe cases, and 5% of patients are Critically Severe cases [5] . Severe-Critically Severe cases usually develop Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) or Multiple Organ Dysfunction Syndrome (MODS) within two weeks of infection [6] , which consumes most of the medical resources and leads to a high case fatality rate (up to 49%) [5, 6] . Early prediction of the severity of COVID-19 can help quickly triage patients (i.e., quarantine, hospital admission or ICU assignment, etc.) and optimize the use of medical resources and timely medical intervention [7, 8] . Blood routine test is the most basic examination. The blood routine test results include red blood cell count (RBC), hemoglobin (HGB), platelets (PLT), white blood cell count (WBC), lymphocyte count (LYMC), lymphocyte ratio (LYMPH), neutrophil count (NEUT), neutrophil ratio (NEU) neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR), etc. [9] [10] [11] . For infectious diseases, a substantial increase or decrease of WBC prompt the severity of the infection. The number and proportion of NEUT can be used to determine the presence or absence of bacterial infection. The rise or fall of LYMC is a characteristic of viral infection [12] . Decreasing of lymphocytes is one of the most critical features of SARS-Cov-2 infection [13] . Of all the initial tests for COVID-19 patients, blood routine test is the worldwide common test with good consistency, and the results are usually available within 2 hours. Due to the influx of a large number of patients into the hospital and the running of medical resources, blood routine test might be the only possible check while COVID-19 patients first go to a fever clinic in a community hospital [4] .",

We first defined feature selection as a Multiple Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) problem that considers the correlation between input features and the correlation between input and output features [23] [24] [25] [26] . In MCDM, some methods provide the priority of indicators, while others provide the ranking of indicators. One of the MCDM ranking methods is the Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS), which has been used in the selection of significant risk factors for healthcare and prognosis [27] [28] [29] . Different from the existing TOPSIS methods [8, 27] , we use maximum relevance and minimum redundancy [30] [31] [32] as the criteria for feature selection in order to select independent risk factors. The maximal relevance feature is to select the input features with the highest relevance to output features. The combinations of individually good features do not necessarily lead to good classification performance [30, 31] . The minimal redundancy is to reduce the redundancy among input features. We then used a series of intuitive measures of relevance and redundancy to select independent risk factors. Finally, we use Na\u00efve Bayes (NB) classifier to achieve the highest prediction accuracy with the fewest input features. Using TOP-SIS MCDM, we successfully screened out \"independent risk factors\" that predict the severity of COVID-19 [25] .",

Feature selection aims to choosing a small subset of the relevant features from the original features by removing irrelevant, redundant, or noisy features.

To simplify the analysis, we then preprocess R in 2 steps. STEP1: We ignored the sign of R Feature ranking. We defined a labeled feature set L and initialized with L = ;. We iterated the procedure of ranking input features x2X and moved the first in each ranking from X to L. The ranking criteria includes 2 evaluations: EVAL1: The correlation between input feature x2X and output feature y2Y, R[x,y] or R[y,x].

Comparing Mild-Moderate and Severe-Critically Sever groups, the basal features showed no differences in Gender (p = 0.26) (Fig 1A) . The Severe-Critically Severe group was significantly older than the Mild-Moderate group (p <0.001) (Fig 1B) . The initial blood routine test seems to be important for predicting the severity of COVID-19: The Severe-Critically Severe group had a higher WBC level (p = 0.02) (Fig 1C) . The Severe-Critically Severe group had extremely low LYMC (p<0.001) and LYMPH (p<0.001) (Fig 1D and 1E ). In contrast, NEUT (p<0.001) and NEU (p<0.001) in the Severe-Critically Severe group were extremely high (Fig 1F and 1G) . As a result, the Severe-Critically Severe group had a higher NLR (p<0.001) (Fig 1H) . These observations suggest that patients' age, and WBC, LYMC, LYMPH, NEUT, NEU, NLR from the initial blood routine test could be critical factors for predicting the severity of COVID-19. ",

These results indicated that Age and initial blood routine test results-WBC, LYMC, NEUT, NLR, might be important for predicting the severity of COVID-19. Wald test showed that only Age was the key indicator in predicting the severity of COVID-19 (Table 2 ). Using stratified random sampling, we generated the ROC curve to evaluate the predictive values: 80% for the \"training set\" and 20% for the \"testing set\". Using [18] for prediction, we can obtain an accuracy of 0.77, and an AUC of 0.92 (Fig 2C) . Through dispersion analysis, we found that WBC, LYMC and LYMPH may be able to optimize prediction performance (Tables 3 and 4 ). The ROC curve showed that {Age, WBC, LYMC} had an accuracy of 0.82 and an AUC of 0.93 (Fig 2D) . These results suggested that it is a good predictor of COVID-19 severity, but the accuracy was only 0.77. Using WBC and LYMC from initial blood routine test could rise the accuracy to 0.82.",

According to the latest meta-analysis of the elderly in the European community, the prevalence of frailty is around 15% for the elderly 65 years and older [35] , and the case fatality rate of patients over 85 years old is 1,000 times that of patients aged 5-17 years [36] . Our research indicated that age was the most important indicator for predicting the severity of COVID-19, with an accuracy 0.77 and an AUC of 0.92. However, some elderly patients had a good prognosis, so prognostic evaluation and medical decisionmaking based on age alone might not be accurate enough.",

            "text": "We found that WBC, LYMC and NEUT in initial blood routine test results other than age are also crucial for predicting the severity of COVID-19. Guo et al. [37] pointed out that the MuLBSTA score revealed that multi-lobar infiltrates, lymphocytes \ufffd0.8\u00d710 9 /L, bacterial infection, smoking status, hypertension, and age \ufffd60 years could help prognosticate outcomes in COVID-19 patients [38] . The elevated WBC/NEUT is an essential sign of bacterial infection. Bacterial co-infection in COVID-19 patients may develop a severe form of disease, complicating the clinical situation [39] [40] [41] . The control and elimination of viruses depend on humoral immunity. Viral infections usually lead to abnormal changes in lymphocyte subsets which further impaired immune system functionality. The decrease of LYMC is the most straightforward and most intuitive indicator to predict the humoral immune response, indicating that the patient's T cell function is defective [18, 42, 43] . The count of lymphocyte subsets (CD4 + and CD8+ T cell), especially CD8+ T cell, is directly proportional to the severity of COVID-19 [44, 45] . Although logistic regression can determine the key indicator Age, and discrete analysis can find a better subset {Age, WBC LYMC}, it is difficult to determine the best subset due to the small sample size or multicollinearity. Previous studies used the MCDM algorithm to evaluate diagnostic tests [46] and help doctors hasten COVID-19 treatment [47] . As far as we know, this is the first time the MCDM algorithm has been used to predict the severity of COVID-19. It first uses TOPSIS for feature ranking, and then combines the NB classifier for feature selection. Even if the sample size is small, the MCDM algorithm can select 3 effective subsets {Age, WBC, LYMC}, {Age, WBC, LYMC, NEUT} and {Age, NEUT, LYMC}. The selection process is visual and interpretable helping doctors find the features of the progress of emerging infectious diseases early, to make faster and better prevention and treatment plans. We used the ROC curve to evaluate the predictive value of the features selected by the MCDM algorithm. The results showed that the MCDM algorithm can not only find all effective subsets, but also predict stably and accurately.",

Although these features can improve the prediction accuracy (84%~93%), the tests are timeconsuming, expensive, and labor-intensive. Our algorithm can select features from blood test results to achieve a prediction accuracy of 82%. During the COVID-19 pandemic, it is more in line with clinical needs and is easy to promote and use in areas with different medical levels. Our research provides a possible and convenient strategy for the early prediction of COVID-19 severity. However, there are some limitations associated with it. First, there were only 196 cases, and all were from China. The sample size of the study was relatively small. We would like to collect more data and conduct multi-center evaluations. Second, the patient selection process may have been affected by referral bias because of the retrospective design. Third, the screening features are all derived from blood routine tests and are relatively simple. Other features, such as chest CT, absolute T cell count, etc., can be included during the therapy to further evaluate and predict patients' prognosis.",

Advanced age, combined bacterial infections, and low immunity are the main reasons leading to the severity of COVID-19. We are considered feature selection as an MCDM problem so that the algorithm could provide a reference for clinical practice. Using the most common blood routine test, medical institutions could better determine the quarantine, hospital admission, ICU assignment of COVID-19 patients. The MCDM algorithm can be used for small sample data sets, and the prediction is accurate and stable. This study not only provided a reference for establishing a rapid response mechanism in the early stage of emerging infectious disease outbreaks but also help doctors understand the pathogenesis of new infectious disease through key indicators.
