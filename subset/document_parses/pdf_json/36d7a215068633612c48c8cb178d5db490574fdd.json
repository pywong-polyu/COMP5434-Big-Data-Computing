To date, the only proven route of transmission is the faecal-oral route, but a possible localisation of FCoV in the reproductive tract of tom cats is of concern, owing to the involvement of the male reproductive tract during FIP and to the presence of reproduction disorders in FCoV-endemic feline catteries. The aim of the study was to investigate the presence and localisation of FCoV in semen and/or in the reproductive tract of tom cats, and its possible association with seroconversion and viraemic phase. Methods Blood, serum, semen and/or testicle samples were obtained from 46 tom cats. Serology was performed on 38 serum samples, nested reverse transcriptase PCR (nRT-PCR) and reverse transcriptase quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) were performed on 39 blood samples and on 17 semen samples, and histology, immunohistochemistry and nRT-PCR were performed on 39 testicles. Results Twenty-four of 38 serum samples were positive on serology. Semen samples were negative on RT-PCR and RT-qPCR for FCoV, while all blood samples were negative at both molecular methods, except for one sample positive at RT-qPCR with a very low viral load. All testicles were negative at immunohistochemistry, while six were positive at nRT-PCR for FCoV. Serology and blood PCR results suggest that the virus was present in the environment, stimulating transient seroconversion. FCoV seems not to localise in the semen of tom cats, making the venereal route as a way of transmission unlikely. Although viral RNA was found in some testicles, it could not be correlated with the viraemic phase.

The causative agent is feline coronavirus (FCoV), generated by a mutation of the widespread enteric pathotype, that gains the ability to replicate in macrophages, and spreads through infected monocytes. 1 The course of the infection depends, in part, upon the type and strength of the immune response of the host, 2-4 but environmental factors, such as the level of stress and overcrowding, also play a role. 5 FCoV infection is very common in cats; around 40% of the domestic cat population has been infected with FCoV, and this figure may increase up to 90% in multi-cat households. 6, 7 Natural FCoV infections are transient in ~70% of cats, but persistent infections can occur in ~13% of cats, 8 while around 5-10% of cats are believed to be resistant to FCoV infection. In most cases, FCoV infection is asymptomatic, or results in only mild gastrointestinal clinical signs; however, in a small percentage of cases, FCoV infection results in FIP. 5 Asymptomatic FCoV infection was previously believed to be confined to the intestinal tract, but it is now known that healthy FCoV-infected cats can have systemic infection, albeit with lower viral loads than cats with FIP. 9 These recurrent phases of intestinal colonisation and faecal shedding of the virus may lead to a transient localisation in several organs and are followed by seroconversion and negativisation at the intestinal level. 10, 11 During the viraemic phase, it is possible that the virus also localises in the reproductive tract, and that it is shed with semen, contributing to the spread of the FCoV by coupling or by artificial insemination (AI) in breeding cats.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 284, "end": 285, "text": "1", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 490, "end": 491, "text": "5", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 666, "end": 668, "text": "6,", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 669, "end": 670, "text": "7", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 779, "end": 780, "text": "8", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1032, "end": 1033, "text": "5", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1257, "end": 1258, "text": "9", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1476, "end": 1479, "text": "10,", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 1480, "end": 1482, "text": "11", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Nowadays, AI has become reasonably successful in the domestic cat, sufficiently so to contribute to genetic management of catteries. 12 Therefore, there is concern about the possibility of sexual transmission of viruses through AI.

The very high C T value of the positive sample suggests that the concentration of viral RNA in the sample was extremely low. The RT-qPCR positivity resulted in a seronegative cat and this is in accordance with FCoV infection kinetics. 23 Antibody titres were variable, with mostly medium-to-low titres, while titres >1:200 were found only in a few cases. Taken together, the serology and blood PCR results suggested that the virus was present in the environment and stimulated transient seroconversion in some of the cats. Positive serology in cats without viral RNA in blood is, in fact, unlikely to be imputable to a low viral load in blood because samples were analysed by RT-qPCR, which is a very sensitive method, and it is more likely that the results are due to the characteristics of FCoVhost interactions. 4, 10, 24 It is also possible that an infected cat could not be identified with PCR on blood if the virus was present in the intestinal tract only. Unfortunately, our study design did not include faecal sampling and it is therefore impossible to confirm that seropositive and PCR-negative cats were shedding the virus with faeces. However, positive serology demonstrates that the cats included in this study had been in contact with the virus, as cats may remain positive also after the clearance of the virus. In particular, antibodies against FCoV are typically fluctuating and cats, especially those from multicat environments, alternate serological negatives and positives, corresponding with re-infection episodes. 11, 25 From this perspective, and considering that anti-FCoV antibodies are found in cats with viral RNA both in faeces and tissues of healthy animals and in FIP affected cats, 11, 26, 27 the medium-to-high antibody titres recorded in some of the cats of the current study may indicate that these cats had been, or still were, infected with FCoV at the moment of sampling, and therefore it is possible that they were harbouring the virus in tissues. This hypothesis is supported by the finding that some testicles were RT-PCR positive, but always negative at immunohistochemistry. This is not surprising, as PCR is characterised by a higher analytical sensitivity compared with IHC. 28, 29 However, RT-PCR is performed on homogenised samples, thus not allowing us to determine which cellular line of the testicle was infected.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 408, "end": 410, "text": "23", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 988, "end": 990, "text": "4,", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 991, "end": 994, "text": "10,", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 995, "end": 997, "text": "24", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 1708, "end": 1711, "text": "11,", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 1712, "end": 1714, "text": "25", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 1885, "end": 1888, "text": "11,", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 1889, "end": 1892, "text": "26,", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 1893, "end": 1895, "text": "27", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 2391, "end": 2394, "text": "28,", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 2395, "end": 2397, "text": "29", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "It is important to highlight that only one of the cats with viral RNA in the testicle and with available serum was seronegative, while all the other cats with PCRpositive testicles had titres ranging from 1:100 to 1:400. In the light of what has been discussed above, this may be explained by two hypotheses. The first hypothesis is that the cats were viraemic but with a blood viral load too low to be detected by standard PCR, and the virus was present only in the vessels or in the plasma contained in the testicle. However, the examination with RT-qPCR, which is more sensitive than standard PCR, makes this hypothesis unlikely, as well as the fact that the only viraemic cat, even if with a very low viral load, was PCR negative on testicles.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Another hypothesis, as already demonstrated, is that the examined section for IHC did not include the cells infected by FCoV, which were present in the sections used for RT-PCR instead. 2, 3 In any case, the section used for PCR was carefully handled to avoid haematic contamination as much as possible and therefore it is unlikely that testicles were falsely positive owing to contaminating FCoV genome. Also, the presence of FCoV in the testicular vessels would not explain why the same positivity was not found on blood, from which a larger amount of sample was used for RNA extraction. The most likely hypothesis is that the virus was isolated in the testicular compartment through the blood-testis barrier, as already demonstrated with the blood-brain barrier, thus explaining the discordant results between peripheral blood and testicles. 30 Interestingly, the only FIP-affected cat had a negative RT-PCR result on the testicle sample. While it was not possible to perform serology and PCR on blood, several tissues from this cat were analysed for diagnostic purposes. All tissues examined were negative on both PCR and IHC, except for brain and cerebellum, which were the only organs harbouring the typical FIP lesions along with intralesional antigen, and a mesenteric lymph node, which was positive on PCR only. This finding supports evidence of a higher analytical sensitivity of RT-PCR and also the fact that positive PCR results do not allow us to distinguish between FIP-affected and FCoV-infected healthy cats. 4, 29 Moreover, the absence of typical histological lesions, as well as of positive IHC, demonstrates that genital involvement is rare during FIP, especially in non-effusive and localised forms, and probably also testicle involvement in FCoV-infected healthy cats. 17, 18 None of the semen samples were RT-PCR and RT-qPCR positive for FCoV. Only in one cat, for which both testicle and semen samples were available, were results discordant, with positive RT-PCR for the testicle sample, but negative for the semen sample. Also, it cannot be excluded that the virus was present on the stromal or vascular tissues of the testicle and not in germinal cells, leading to a negative PCR result on semen. Unfortunately, the negative IHC results, likely due to the low amount of virus as hypothesised above, does not allow us to further elucidate this aspect. It is also important to consider that the diagnostic sensitivity of RT-PCR and RT-qPCR on feline semen is unknown; in this study we applied the method of RNA extraction from semen that is described to have the best analytical sensitivity in comparison with other methods. 31 Therefore, although unlikely, as this method has been successfully used in other studies, the presence of false-negative results cannot be excluded. 32 Moreover, most of the cats from which semen was tested were also seronegative or had low antibody titres. Even though seronegative cats cannot be considered free from infection for the already discussed kinetics of both the virus and the antibody responses, it is possible that cats were not viraemic and that the virus was not systemically spread or was localised in some organs at the time of semen collection. 33 Unfortunately, for the only cat that was RT-qPCR positive on blood, a semen sample was not available.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 186, "end": 188, "text": "2,", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 189, "end": 190, "text": "3", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 845, "end": 847, "text": "30", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 1525, "end": 1527, "text": "4,", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1528, "end": 1530, "text": "29", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 1790, "end": 1793, "text": "17,", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 1794, "end": 1796, "text": "18", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 2649, "end": 2651, "text": "31", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 2801, "end": 2803, "text": "32", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 3217, "end": 3219, "text": "33", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Even if positive PCR results on testicles may suggest the venereal route as a potential way of FCoV transmission, FCoV seems not to localise in the semen of tom cats, and so this route seems to be unlikely.
