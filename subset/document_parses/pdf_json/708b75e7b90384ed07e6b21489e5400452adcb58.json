If a patient has diarrhea and it is uncertain if this is due to a disease flare or COVID-19, we advocate to wait and see the course of the diarrhea for the next 5 days, given the diarrhea in COVID-19-positive patients is usually mild and self-limited typically lasting 5 days and follow biomarkers (e.g., C-reactive protein, calprotectin). Calprotectin is usually only mildly elevated in patients with COVID-19 with diarrhea, whereas in patients with IBD with active disease, significant elevation may occur. The reliability and effectiveness of serologic antibody testing and, ultimately, of vaccines will have additional special considerations for patients with IBD who are receiving immune therapies.",

If this indeed is similar to a patient's usual IBD symptoms or an obvious explanation is identified (such as Clostridioides difficile infection), then addressing the cause of the relapse is recommended. This may include continuation of current medical therapy with optimization to reobtain a state of remission. If new immunebased treatments are needed, then avoiding prednisone when possible is preferred, recognizing that many of the therapies currently available were studied for induction without the use of concomitant steroids. Patients using prednisone should avoid high-dose therapy ($20 mg daily) and attempt to lower therapy to the least effective dose or even to switch to oral budesonide formulations or topical formulations. If treating a patient with corticosteroids, initial use of oral budesonide formulations or topical formulations is preferred.

The other practical reality is that many of these therapies have half-lives such that they will still be present during the viral infection, even if they are held, discontinued, or dosing is delayed.

            "text": "Although there are limited data on the risks and outcomes of COVID-19 in patients with IBD, general strategies to keep this population of patients safe include strict physical distancing. The symptoms and clinical presentation of COVID-19 in patients with IBD is likely similar to patients without IBD, but the presence of digestive symptoms associated with COVID-19 onset can be confusing and requires special attention to distinguish these symptoms from those of active IBD. In patients with IBD who have known or suspected COVID-19, immunebased therapies should be discontinued until the illness is cleared and, in the near future, may also be used after testing confirms clearance of virus or convalescent phase of immunity. In more severe COVID-19 cases, and when treatment of the COVID-19 with candidate therapies is considered, choice of therapies that may be safe or even have benefit in IBD is preferred. Ongoing data collection and observational studies will guide future management considerations related to widespread testing or utilization of vaccines in this special population. \u2022 For most individuals, this involves the presence of mild and often nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, dry cough, and fever. Gastrointestinal symptoms including anorexia, anosmia, ageusia, dyspepsia, and diarrhea can occur. 7 \u2022 CBC may reveal lymphopenia and neutrophilia. \u25a0 Stage II (moderate)-Pulmonary involvement with or without hypoxia:",
