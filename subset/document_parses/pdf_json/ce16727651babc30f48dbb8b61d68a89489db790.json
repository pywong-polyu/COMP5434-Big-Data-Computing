We defined autoimmune inflammatory rheumatic diseases (inflammatory arthritis and connective tissue diseases) based on the relevant ICD-10 codes, with at least two claims (outpatient or inpatient) within 1 year. The outcomes were positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test, severe COVID-19 (requirement of oxygen therapy, intensive care unit admission, application of invasive ventilation, or death), and COVID-19-related death.

Patients with autoimmune inflammatory rheumatic diseases are considered to be at risk of developing serious infections because of lowered immunity resulting from their underlying conditions and use of immune-modulating therapies. 5, 6 Although several studies have reported the associations between autoimmune inflammatory rheumatic diseases and SARS-CoV-2 infection, COVID-19 outcomes, or COVID-19-related mortality, 5-10 the conclusions have been inconsistent, mainly ascribed to non-hypothesisdriven analysis, sampling bias, or measurement bias. Furthermore, studies have shown that ethnicity might be important in the context of COVID-19. 11 However, to the best of our knowledge, no studies have so far reported COVID-19 outcomes in patients with autoimmune inflammatory rheumatic diseases of Asian ethnicity.

Briefly, our large-scale nation wide cohort included all individuals aged older than 20 years who underwent SARS-CoV-2 testing between Jan 1 and May 30, 2020, in South Korea via the services expedited by the Korean National Health Insurance Service, the Korea Centers for Disease Control, and the Ministry of Health and Welfare, South Korea. The dataset links general health examination records from the Korean National Health Insurance Service and national COVID-19-related register from the Korea Centers for Disease Control. Therefore, the dataset in this study comprised records of personal data, health-care records of inpatients and outpatients, pharmaceutical prescriptions, general health examination results, COVID-19-associated clinical out comes, and death documents in the past 3 years (Jan 1, 2018, to July 30, 2020). All patient-associated medical documents used in this study were kept confidential. The study protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Sejong University (Seoul, South Korea; SJU-HR-E-2020-003). The require ment for written informed consent was waived by the ethics committee due to the urgent medical needs to be met amid the COVID-19 pandemic and the use of routinely collected health data. SARS-CoV-2 infection was confirmed by a positive result on a real-time RT-PCR assay of nasal or pharyngeal swabs according to WHO guidelines. [12] [13] [14] For each patient, the cohort entry date (individual index date) was the date of the first SARS-CoV-2 test. Patients' medical history was evaluated using the appropriate International Classification of Diseases, tenth revision (ICD-10), codes, as reported previously. [12] [13] [14] [15] Current use of medications (aspirin, metformin, statins, systemic corticosteroids, and disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs [DMARDs; methotrexate, leflunomide, azathioprine, sulfasalazine, antimalarials, anti-tumour necrosis factor (TNF) agents, and other biologics]) was defined based on the medications received within 3 months before the individual index date. 14 Anti-TNF agents available in South Korea were infliximab, adalimumab, etanercept, certolizumab, and golimumab. Other biologics available were tocilizumab, rituximab, abatacept, ustekinumab, ixekizumab, and secukinumab. The region of residence was classified as Seoul Capital Area, Daegu/Gyeongbuk area, or other area, as previously reported.

First, we used exposure-driven propensity score matching to adjust for the baseline covariates of the two groups (ie, patients with and without autoimmune inflammatory rheumatic diseases) and to minimise potential confounding factors from the predicted probability of patients with an autoimmune inflammatory rheumatic disease versus those without (matched cohort A), patients with inflam matory arthritis versus those without (matched cohort B), and patients with connective tissue disease versus those without (matched cohort C). Each matching was done in a 3:1 ratio using a greedy nearest-neighbour algorithm. The variables used for matching each cohort are in the appendix (pp 3-5). Second, we implemented three additional exposure-driven propensity score matching strategies based on the nationwide cohort study without linking the general health examination records (matched cohorts D-F; appendix pp [25] [26] . Finally, to avoid overmatching bias, we selected the matched covariates by using the directed acyclic graph approach (appendix pp 39-40) and matched six additional cohorts (matched cohorts G-L) based on matched cohort A-F. We used a directed acyclic graph approach to confirm adequate potential mediators and thus provide a visualisation of the causal relationship between auto immune inflam matory rheumatic disease (exposure) and the risk of COVID-19 (outcome). 17 Subsequently, we used a logistic regression model with minimal adjustment for age (20- disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hypertension, or chronic kidney disease; household income (low, middle, and high); smoking (never, ex, and current); frequency of alcohol consumption (<1, 1-2, 3-4, and \u22655 days per week); body-mass index (<25 kg/m\u00b2, 25-30 kg/m\u00b2, and \u226530 kg/m\u00b2); sufficient aerobic activity; and current use of aspirin, metformin, and a statin. To investigate the association of COVID-19-related outcomes by current treatment, we did subgroup analyses stratified by DMARDs and systemic corticosteroids. Adequacy of the matching was established by comparing exposuredriven propensity score densities and standardised mean differences (appendix pp 27-38). Adjusted odds ratios (ORs) with 95% CIs were estimated after adjusting for the potential confounders. Statistical analyses were done with SAS software (version 9.4) and R software (version 3.6.1). Directed acyclic graphics were presented with DAGitty (version 2.3). A two-sided p value of less than 0\u00b705 was considered to be significant.",

Our results showed that patients with autoimmune inflammatory rheumatic diseases have an increased risk of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2, a finding that corresponds well with a previous meta-analysis. 22 However, to our knowledge, no study has shown a difference in the odds of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 between patients with inflammatory arthritis and those with connective tissue diseases compared with the general population. We believe this is the first study to show that patients with inflammatory arthritis and connective tissue diseases are at increased risk of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 independently. Furthermore, we found no association between connective tissue disease and COVID-19-related death, but these findings might be due to the small number of patients with connective tissue disease, which calls for further large-scale and international studies.",

Our findings from a South Korean nationwide cohort support European and North American studies that showed that patients with autoimmune inflammatory rheumatic diseases have an increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection, severe COVID-19, and COVID-19-related death. A previous epidemiological study also reported that Asian ethnicity compared with White ethnicity is associated with higher intensive care admission and COVID-19-related mortality rates, 25 which is consistent with our main findings. The reason for this adverse association of COVID-19 with Asian ethnicity might be due to higher angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) Data are n (%) unless otherwise indicate. Percentages might not sum to 100% due to rounding. A standardised mean difference of less than 0\u00b71 indicates no major imbalance. All standardised mean difference values were less than 0\u00b708 in the propensity score-matched cohort. *More than 500 metabolic equivalent task min per week. The use of DMARDs was not associated with any COVID-19-related endpoints in our study. There is conflicting evidence of an association between corticosteroid use and severe COVID-19 outcomes. One study reported no relationship between inhaled corticosteroid use and COVID-19-related death among people with asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. 27 Our results suggest that patients with autoimmune inflammatory rheumatic disease receiving any dose of systemic corticosteroids do not have an increased risk of a positive SARS-CoV-2 test, severe COVID-19, or COVID-19-related death. However, the patients with autoimmune inflammatory rheumatic disease receiving a high dose of systemic corticosteroids have an increased risk of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2, severe COVID-19, COVID-19-related death. Our results support those from a previous cohort study of patients with autoimmune inflammatory rheumatic disease that showed that a high dose of systemic corticosteroids is associated with higher odds of hospitalisation for COVID-19 than not taking corticosteroids. 28 Corticosteroids might reduce ACE2 expression levels, 29 which might lead to altered SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility either beneficially (ie, reduced SARS-CoV-2 entry) or adversely (ie, reduced beneficial effect of ACE2 on hyperinflammation), 30 thereby suggesting a potential dichotomous effect of systemic corticosteroids.",

First, proinflammatory cytokines implicated in most rheumatic diseases, such as interleukin-6, TNF, and interleukin-1, have been reported as the pathogenic factors produced by macrophages after T lymphocytes bearing T-cell receptors recognise SARS-CoV-2 bound to the surface of cells, and these cytokines might be culpable for the tissue destruction in various organs in patients with severe COVID-19. 31 It is plausible that rheumatic disorders and COVID-19 could affect each other at the pathogenic level, which ultimately results in decline in patients' conditions. Second, the immunological abnormalities due to rheumatic disease affect most circulating T cells, which evolve from an early stage in the rheumatic disease course. 32 T-cell dynamics in patients with autoimmune inflam matory rheumatic disease (ie, lack of T-cell receptor rearrangement excision circle-positive cells and abnormalities in T-cell homoeostasis) suggests that the ability of patients with autoimmune inflammatory rheu matic diseases to react to novel antigens, such as during SARS-CoV-2 infection, is compromised. 32 Third, ACE2 receptor and transmembrane serine protease 2 have an important role in the entry of SARS-CoV-2 and are highly expressed in autoimmune diseases 33 and chronic inflammatory diseases, 34 suggesting that patients with autoimmune inflammatory rheumatic diseases might be at a higher risk of poor COVID-19 outcomes, which is consistent with our findings.
