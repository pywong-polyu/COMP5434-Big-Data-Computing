There is knowledge about life with venous leg ulcers, but the situation after healing is unexplored. This paper explores and describes meanings of experiences of daily life after healing of a hard-to-heal venous leg ulcer. Methods: Lived experiences of 15 individuals with healed hard-to-heal venous leg ulcers generated data for this study. Interviews were recorded for analysis using a reflective lifeworld research approach. An essence emerged, further described by its constituents. Results: Memories of a difficult time with leg ulcer were ever present, in a way becoming part of the self. A striving for control in daily life entailed a struggle to do what was best for the own body. After healing, a new normal emerged in daily life, a reality that encompassed the risk for a new ulcer. The body had changed physically, with marks alongside those from ageing, in a life that still went on.",

            "text": "It is estimated that 0.1-0.3% of inhabitants in the Western world are affected by venous leg ulcers (VLUs; Nelzen, 2008) . Ulcers that do not heal within six weeks are in several studies referred to as hard-toheal (Fagerstr\u00f6m et al., 2022; Forssgren et al., 2008; Forssgren & Nelz\u00e9n, 2012) . Previously, these ulcers were known as chronic (Dale et al., 1983 ). An ulcer's healing time depends on its aetiology and can range from days to several decades (Oien & Forssell, 2013) . This definition is not based on the cause of the ulcer (Vowden, 2011) . Predisposed persons are at increased risk of getting ulcers and factors like diabetes, high blood pressure, and arterial and/or venous insufficiency increase the risk that an ulcer becomes hard to heal (Lindholm et al., 1992) . Venous insufficiency causes blood to accumulate in the legs and feet, leading to oedema and local hypertension, which further exacerbates the circulatory insufficiency (Lindholm, 2018) . About 50% of all leg and foot ulcers are caused by venous insufficiency, though the actual figure may be higher, since not all patients are diagnosed by physicians (Lindholm et al., 1992) . A lacking or inaccurate diagnosis is likely to lead to longer healing time and increased suffering for the patient, since early management is crucial (Oien & Forssell, 2013) . Varicose veins are also known to increase the risk that venous leg ulcers become hard to heal (National Health Service, 2019). Female sex, heredity, advanced age, pregnancy, and a job that involves standing are considered to be important causes of varicose veins (National Health Service, 2020). Knowledge of the importance of these mechanisms has been reported to be lacking among those affected by VLUs (Meulendijks et al., 2020) .",

Studies have emphasized parameters facilitating life in a new context with a chronic illness, such as understanding and acceptance (Ambrosio et al., 2015; Chiaranai et al., 2018) . It is also known that persons with chronic illnesses can experience a loss of stability in life. A changed balance and reduced control over life creates a new reality (Ambrosio et al., 2015) . Since it is known that persons with chronic diseases may feel they have undergone a major change in life, it is of a great importance that we enhance knowledge about daily life for persons with healed VLUs. We intended to increase insights into their lifeworld, with a focus on lived experiences, and thereby get a chance to improve the situation among those affected. The lifeworld takes the individual's whole situation-their perspective on their own situation and what is meaningful to them-into consideration (Dahlberg et al., 2008) .

Reflective lifeworld research is based on the phenomenology of Husserl's lifeworld theory and the theory of intentionality (Husserl, 1980) and the theory of the lived body by Merleau-Ponty (Merleau-Ponty, 1945 . This descriptive phenomenological design provides an opportunity to understand the lived experiences of persons with healed VLUs. Husserl's theory of intentionality constitutes a solid foundation related to one's own understanding. Concepts such as \"bridling\" and openness have an impact on a reflective lifeworld study, as the researcher \"bridles\" their pre-understanding and thereby remains open to what is actually said (Dahlberg et al., 2008) . The importance of letting the phenomenon be boundless for as long as possibleor, as described by Dahlberg and Dahlberg: not mak- ing definite what is indefinite (Dahlberg & Dahlberg, 2003) -typifies the RLR approach.",

Due to travel restrictions and a focus on the security of the participants during the COVID-19 pandemic, the interviews were conducted via telephone. All participants chose to take the interview call in their personal home. All interviews started with an open-ended question: \"Could you please describe your daily life?\" In order to gain in-depth answers, follow-up questions such as \"What does that mean for you?\" or \"How does that affect you?\" were asked (Dahlberg et al., 2008) . Interviews lasted between 17 and 81 minutes and were recorded and transcribed verbatim. Interview transcripts were not checked by participants. To supplement the recordings, field notes were taken.

Familiarization with the interviews, gained through multiple readings, gave an insight into the entirety of the material. Meaning units, related to the phenomenon under study, were retrieved from the transcribed interviews. Meanings were then clustered together, based on similarities and differences. Clusters were interrelated in order to find patterns of meanings within the phenomenon. A movement between the parts and the whole led to the emergence of the phenomenon's essential meaning structure; a new wholeness was reached. The phenomenon's essence could be described as its heart, at an abstract level, and is described and clarified by its constituents. Throughout the analysis, there was a focus on not making definite what was indefinite, which meant lingering before deciding upon a meaning (Dahlberg et al., 2008) . Analysis was performed by the first and last author, and the process was discussed within the research group. The results are first presented through the essence of the phenomenon, daily life after healing of a hard-to-heal ulcer, and then through its constituents.

Positive changes in relation to physical impairments were a delight, but a sense of hollowness was never far away; changes in the wrong direction took a toll on the person and their daily life. In a way, the burden had changed guise; the ulcer was gone, but pain, itching, and eczema still tormented daily life. There was a constant awareness that the risk for new ulcers remained, even if there was hope, since treatment had been successful. Uncertainty regarding the reason behind the ulcer led to a feeling of powerlessness in daily life. Not knowing how to protect oneself against new ulcers increased this feeling of powerlessness. Other experiences, such as a difficult treatment period, could serve as reminders of the ulcer and connected it to the self, leading to a heightened sense of caution in relation to the own body. It was common to avoid situations that could increase the risk of a new ulcer. An ulcer was an event that was unwanted in the future, with the experience of the healed ulcer serving as a warning.

These included using crutches, a wheelchair, or a walker, sometimes even if they were not prescribed for oneself; a strong desire for independent mobility created a need for aids. Elements that seemed to bestow some control over daily life were correct use of compression stockings, using moisturizing cream, or elevating one's legs while seated.

The use of the less tight class II compression stockings, instead of the prescribed class III, offered a sense of control to the individual, who could now do as they liked. Independence was a recurring theme: an active choice not to use compression stockings in the summer or to use a cream intended only for acute treatment of thrombophlebitis over a long time period.

The ulcer had grown silent, since it had healed. While the ulcer was no longer there in a physical way, it remained vibrant in the lived body. Life had changed and a new normal emerged. Arman and Rhensfeldt (2012) have stated that life-changing events have the ability to alter one's priorities in daily life. What has been important might lose or decrease in importance (Arman & Rhensfeldt, 2012) . Persons with healed VLUs reported a newly discovered joy in being healed. Improvements in health may create new opportunities in life and thus a chance to change one's life (Arman & Rhensfeldt, 2012) . Though a change can be seen as an opportunity, it can also be experienced as a loss, rather than an active choice. Nevertheless, a new meaning might be created or at least initiated through the suffering of living with an ulcer (Arman & Rhensfeldt, 2006) . For some reason, persons do not return to what life was like before the ulcer. A study with the aim to identify the relationship between the present and what the situation was like before an ulcer would therefore be of interest.",

The inability to leave parts of one's lifeworld behind can be described using the theory of Arman and Rhensfeldt (2006) . In a way, suffering might be seen as a constant companion that never completely vanishes, even if it changes shape. The aim is always to create a balance in life-suffering must be bearable-and in order to achieve this, life must sometimes be reassessed and a new meaning found (Arman & Rhensfeldt, 2006) . According to Arman and Rhensfeldt (2006) , meaning is associated with hope and a future that offers something better. A new understanding of life and what it offers can create a meaning in life. A life without change is dark and characterized by unbearable suffering that is not associated with acceptance or openness (Arman & Rhensfeldt, 2006) . But how does the loss of life as it was affect a person? Can the new, changed life induce new suffering, based on a lost capacity to continue with an activity or a hobby?",

It seems that persons with chronic heart failure live with a constant fear of the future (Jeon et al., 2010) . Falk et al. have stated that heart failure can cause persons to choose a \"less complex and eventful life\" (Falk et al., 2007) , which also seems to be the case among persons with healed ulcers. Barello and Graffigna (2015) and Arman and Rhensfeldt (2006) have argued that a new meaning in life has to be created when a person is diagnosed with a chronic illness. Hobbies and activities that are discontinued during treatment are not always resumed after healing, sometimes being replaced by activities adapted for the new situation. Fatigue has been shown to be the main reason for this in persons with heart failure (Falk et al., 2007) , but our study indicated that the main reason among persons with healed ulcer was a reluctance to risk getting a new ulcer. Still, the outcome is similar: a restricted life. Limitations in life and activities are also seen in persons receiving haemodialysis (Chiaranai, 2016) . We argue that persons with a healed ulcer share some experiences with persons with other chronic illnesses. This is supported by a study encompassing multiple chronic illnesses, in which the researchers stated that those affected often described to their lives as restricted (Chiaranai et al., 2018) .",

Even if the future was rather uncertain for the persons with VLU, it seemed that the new life after healing was associated not only with anxiety, but also with a belief that they might stay healthy. However, the present study did not explore the future and not much was said about it, beyond the hope not to get another ulcer. This may mirror what was found by Barello and Graffigna, who stated that patients might lack confidence in the future, causing an incapacity to make plans for it (Barello & Graffigna, 2015) . Bonino stated that chronically ill persons need to adjust not only their goals, but also their entire identity, in the same way they would in ageing (Bonino, 2021) . As mentioned before, persons affected by VLUs are often older adults, which would mean such changes are necessary for several reasons.",

Robinson has stated that the normal in persons' lives tends to change over time; illness imposes a new normal, that comes to be accepted with time. Robinson also mentioned that by concentrating on living normally, setbacks and issues could be disregarded and would lose their importance in daily life. For example, frequent hospitalizations or chronic pain could be accepted, since there they were an inevitable part of life (Robinson, 1993) and had become the new normal. This could give a sense of control in a new life context, which might be affected by the loss of cherished activities. Barello and Graffigna also emphasized that there is an underlying desire to be normal, even when life may take a new turn (Barello & Graffigna, 2015) . The ties between the self's history, present, and future were apparent in this study. Merleau-Ponty stated that the human body is a tool for accessing the world and that it consists of experiences gathered over time. The body as an experiencer entails that we can never free ourselves from our past-the body is ever-present in what happens in life (Merleau-Ponty, 1945 . As a basis for reflective lifeworld research, Dahlberg et al. stated that the lifeworld consists of all the experiences in a person's life, with all the lived experiences influencing the perception of one's own situation (Dahlberg et al., 2008) . With this in mind, it is understandable that one can never free oneself from one's history. The experience of living with an ulcer leaves a mark on a person even after healing: memories are forever. But as Bonino stated: life should not be survived, but lived (Bonino, 2021) . Active ulcers are known to have physical, psychological, and social impacts on daily life (Isaac & Watson, 2016) and this study serves as a reminder that healing does not automatically negate these effects.",

There are arguments that rich data-provided by participants, with a focus on the phenomenon-are more important than the means of the handover itself (Dahlberg et al., 2008) . Telephone interviews may offer a greater perceived anonymity, making it easier to speak openly (Trier-Bieniek, 2012). There is also a belief that there are no differences between face-to-face and telephone interviews as regards the nature or depth of material (Sturges & Hanrahan, 2004) . However, a sensitivity to pauses and changes in voice or mood can help the interviewer stay focused on the participant's feelings during an interview. When scheduling the interviews, care was taken to ensure enough time with each participant.",

Though some referred to their daily life as normal, life had not yet returned to what it was before. Some activities or hobbies, that had been a part of the self before the ulcer, had been terminated. Daily life after a healed ulcer was thus comparable to daily life for persons affected by other chronic illnesses. The lifeworld with a healed ulcer meant living with an obvious impact from the ulcer. The period with an ulcer, which was sometimes prolonged and always entailed hardship, had become part of life and could not be expunged from the present. Thus, ulcers leave more than just a physically scarred body. This study complemented our knowledge by revealing that daily life was shaken to its core, meaning that living with a hard-to-heal ulcer and all that this entailed had left a lasting legacy.",

The findings of this study contribute with lived experiences regarding the clinical nursing of VLUs.
