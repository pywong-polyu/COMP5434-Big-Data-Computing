Our framework combines annotations generated by any number of NLP systems into an exhaustive set of ensembles using an approximate grid-search over combinations of Boolean operations. Performance of these Boolean combination ensembles was compared between all available named entity annotations to performance on annotation subsets filtered by UMLS semantic groups. Results We demonstrated how optimized Boolean combination ensembles were constructed using the Fairview corpus on the collection of UMLS concepts filtered by the group Procedures and how our gridsearch strategy identified 20 ensembles that outperformed all individual NLP systems for the group Chemicals & Drugs. We also showed that for UMLS concept matching, Boolean ensembling of the MiPACQ corpus trended towards higher performance over individual systems. Discussion Boolean combination ensembles outperformed single systems in most cases. Use of an approximate grid-search can help optimize the precision-recall tradeoff and can provide a set of heuristics for choosing an optimal set of ensembles.",

NLP-Ensemble-Explorer utilizes a custom mapping to the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) Semantic Network to categorize UMLS concepts by groups (e.g., findings, disorders, procedures, etc.) [1] . We investigated performance of these ensembles for Named Entity Recognition (NER) of UMLS concepts and matching of UMLS Concept Unique Identifiers (CUI)s. Named entities (NE) can be mapped to UMLS CUIs and then extracted to provide consistent and unambiguous conceptual indexing for informatics research as discussed by Re\u00e1tegui and Ratt\u00e9, Pradhan et al. , and Soldaini and Goharian, et al. [2] [3] [4] . Re\u00e1tegui and Ratt\u00e9 compared MetaMap and cTAKES, showing the benefit of aggregation of concepts by UMLS semantic type [2] , while Pradhan, et al. discuss the ShARe/CLEF eHealth 2013 Evaluation Lab Task 1, where NER and concept mapping on Disorder mention was done [3] .

We developed NLP-Ensemble-Explorer to test this idea through examination of an exhaustive set of Boolean combinations of output from multiple NLP systems using logical \u2227 and \u2228 operators. To this end, we created ensembles by combining annotations from multiple clinical datasets using multiple out-of-the-box NLP systems. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to offer such a thorough evaluation of this type of ensembling. We demonstrate this strategy has potential to exploit strengths of each system and corpus and may provide a powerful tool for mapping unstructured text to controlled vocabularies like the UMLS.",

The following examples are representative of well-known patterns that boost performance through: a) Increasing precision by filtering out false positives through use of the \u2227 operator; or b) Increasing recall by filtering out false negatives through use of the \u2228 operator. Optimized Boolean combinations for higher F1-scores employ a balanced mix of these patterns. These examples also illustrate how complementarity can be beneficial when applied to Boolean combination ensembling. Unless otherwise noted, all differences given are statistically significant. The Boolean combination ensemble ((((clamp\u2228metamap)\u2228quick_umls)\u2227biomedicus)\u2227ctakes) on the Fairview corpus for the semantic group Procedures provided the largest gain (0.08) over any single system (cTAKES). The All groups Boolean combination ensemble (((biomedicus\u2227metamap)\u2228clamp)\u2227ctakes) for the same corpus provided a 0.03 absolute improvement over any single system, and this ensemble bore a similar structure to the ensemble above, wherein an INTERSECTION operation with the cTAKES annotation set attenuated the results from several other systems. Further assessment of the individual systems is warranted in order to understand the ways in which these systems can be complementary, e.g. understanding what work QuickUMLS is doing in the ensemble that improves performance for Procedures that is no longer helpful when assessing performance on the corpus as a whole.Boolean combination ensembles for MiPACQ with systems trained on this corpus were all either not significant or lower for F1-score compared to individual systems. Thus, these systems represent an upper bound. However, optimization on precision and recall is still possible, e.g., the Boolean combination (((biomedicus\u2227ctakes)\u2227metamap)\u2227quick_umls) for Anatomy gives a boost of 10% on precision. Similarly, for I2b2 we find the same consistent behavior, e.g., the combination ((clamp\u2227ctakes)\u2227quick_umls) (which is essentially a unanimous vote of the three systems) for Disorders boosted precision to 1.0.",

Unlike other studies, including that of Kang, et al. and Liu et al., that showed use of simple intersection merges diminished concept extraction performance, especially in comparison to a simple majority voting scheme[47][48], our study has shown use of intersection with union operations to be very beneficial.Indeed, Boolean combination ensembles have potential to boost performance through complementarity as demonstrated by comparing ensembles with \"Highest F1-score\" to individual systems for semantic groups of the Fairview corpus.Individual systems often had outsized influence on performance, e.g., the Boolean combination ((biomedicus\u2228ctakes)\u2227clamp) for Fairview Chemicals & Drugs was comprised of CLAMP, which individually had the highest F1-score and precision for this category, while cTAKES had highest recall, and thus when combined with a union of BioMedICUS a higher recall helped boost F1-score. This seems reasonable since the combination is interpretable as \"if text is found both in the CLAMP annotations and in either the BioMedICUS or cTAKES annotations.\" An informal examination of our data found a similar trend of mixed operations for other Boolean combinations, including the ensemble combination ((((biomedicus\u2227ctakes)\u2227metamap)\u2227quick_umls)\u2228clamp), which had the highest F1-score for Fairview Disorders (under column denoted \"Highest F1\") and all biased i2b2 ensembles and their semantic groups.

            "text": "). However, preliminary experiments in our lab using Boolean combination ensembles for use in detecting UMLS concept negation has shown potential to increase accuracy. Third, our choice of semantic mappings relied on existing categories from individual NLP systems and from the UMLS Semantic Network. Other mappings that better represent concepts found in the gold standards may exist. Fourth, due to use of built-in python methods, which did not allow for ease of extraction of required parameters, we did not perform significance tests for CUI matching tasks. However, our results can still be used to observe trends.Fifth, since the corpus we used for concept matching of CUIs was used for training statistical models for two of the NLP systems used in this study, it was not possible to perform an unbiased comparison of Boolean combination ensembles with more than three systems. Thus, use of a gold standard corpus labeled for CUIs independent of any NLP system training should be used for a more rigorous evaluation of larger Boolean combination ensembles and their behavior. Sixth, use of multiple versions of the UMLS is a potential confounding factor in this study. However, we observed that performance of systems configured with same versions of UMLS varied greatly across corpora and semantic groups. In addition, systems using older versions of UMLS performed much better than those with newer versions of UMLS on some tasks. It is likely that different UMLS versions contribute to complementarity, since, for example, developers of SemRep continue to use 2006AA, as opposed to newer versions of the UMLS, because there are fewer concepts/synonyms which decreases ambiguity[53]. Lastly, our test for complementarity was only used for the NER task\u2026 it is important to note that the goal of this study was not to focus on individual system performance, but instead to examine ensemble performance trends for different tasks across corpora and semantic groups using default pipelines of NLP systems.Our observations indicate Boolean combination ensembles for NER will produce a mix of \u2227 and \u2228 operators for top performing ensembles for F1-score, whereas for CUI matching, best ensembles are more likely to have systems joined with the same operator, at least when using only 3 systems. NER generally outperforms document-level matching of CUIs which subsequently outperforms mention-level matching of CUIs. However, for both document and annotation-level CUI matching, most differences between individual systems and the ensembles with highest F1-score appeared to be greater than those for NER. For NER, most top performing Boolean combinations performed better than individual systems for the same semantic group; for both document/mention-level matching of CUIs, all top performing Boolean combination ensembles appeared to outperform single systems across all semantic groups.Methods used in this study can be directly applied to any other clinical NLP systems that map text to UMLS concepts (or other vocabularies) and will work for evaluating any corpus annotated for UMLS concepts (or other vocabularies). While results in this paper are applicable to particular annotation tasks, NLP systems and corpora, the NLP-Ensemble-Explorer framework is designed to be extensible for other clinical annotation tasks. For example, our lab has successfully used NLP-Ensemble-Explorer for the task of clinical acronym sense disambiguation on a completely different corpus [link to AMIA workshop and github branch and corpus].",
