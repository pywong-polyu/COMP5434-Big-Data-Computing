            "text": "During the past two decades, gambling availability has strongly increased as a consequence of socio-economic and political decisions highly oriented towards promoting different gambling forms. Therefore, participation and expenditure have increased, with substantial growth in the prevalence of gambling disorder (GD) and gambling-related revenues, with Italy accounting for 5% of the global revenues [20] . As a consequence, the number of problem gamblers in Italy is high-3% of the global population [21] . Moreover, Italy, among Western countries, had an early diffusion of the COVID-19 virus, and drastic social containment measures were implemented quickly. In fact, the lockdown has entailed a complete closure of the majority of land-based gambling venues for nearly two months, with only the exclusion of scratch cards. Nevertheless, there are a few Italian studies on gambling during the lockdown period, and they were threefold, focusing on the general population, on problem gamblers (PGs) not seeking treatment and PGs in treatment. There was a significant reduction in the total amount of money spent on gambling compared to the previous half-year period (30% lost). Specifically, the reduction has been mainly due to a loss in land-based gambling devices (55% lost), whereas online gambling has had an increase in money spent (25.4%) [22] , even though the cancellation and postponement of sports events in Europe has reduced sports betting [23] . In April-May 2020, a survey on the general population monitored the consequences of the COVID-19 outbreak and the spread of gambling behavior. An increase in frequency and expenditure for online gamblers was observed but no shift from land-based to online gambling was reported [24] . The Italian National Health Service Phone Counselling Service for gambling problems has reported data on non-treatment-seeking PGs calling for support. Gamblers reported feeling distressed at not being able to gamble during the lockdown, experiencing problems concerning past debts and worrying about new debts caused by the pandemic [25] . With regard to PGs in treatment, two regions in Italy surveyed clients in treatment for PG in their health services. During the lockdown period, requests for treatment for PG greatly decreased, whereas there was a slight growth in people asking for economic counselling. Clients already in treatment for PG had a positive attitude about restrictions on gambling venues, and this had positive consequences on their personal and familial environments. They reported no switch from land-based to online gambling [26, 27] .",

Given the impossibility of treating patients during quarantine, it has been recommended to preserve a clinical connection to mitigate the possible effects of the lockdown [28] , and several medical sectors have tried to implement the idea of taking remote clinical action [29] . Thus, we developed a semi-structured telephone interview to be conducted by the healthcare professional in charge of the patients before the lockdown as a monitoring tool to orient supporting actions.",

Based on the above-cited data, we expected a positive effect of the diminished gambling opportunity despite the difficult conditions.

Most patients were married (33%, n = 44) or single (29%, n = 38). Sixteen percent (n = 21) were cohabitant, 15% (n = 20) were separated/divorced and 8% (n = 9) were widowed. As for the familial status, the majority (54%, n = 72) lived with a partner (with or without sons), 26% (n = 34) lived with their original family, 19% (n = 26) lived alone and 1% (n = 1) lived in a residential structure. With regard to the occupational status, 10% (n = 14) were unemployed, 19% (n = 25) were retired, 1% (n = 2) were students and 70% (n = 94) were employed. We classified participants who worked based on the Italian National Institute of Statistics (ISTAT), which divides the population into nine categories. These categories are as follows: legislators, managers and entrepreneurs (n = 0); intellectual, scientific and highly specialized professions (2%, n = 2); technical professions (6%, n = 5); employees (20%, n = 17); business and service professions (17%, n = 15); artisans and farmers (38%, n = 33); plant and semi-skilled workers of fixed and mobile machinery (7%, n = 6); freelancers (7%, n = 6); armed forces (3%, n = 3). Table 1 reports information of the sample in relation to treatment and gambling behavior before the beginning of the lockdown. Patients were under treatment for an average time of about seven years, and most of them were in the course of treatment or in the monitoring phase. The most frequent treatment approach was psychological treatment, and the majority of patients had experienced abstinence from gambling, but half of them had relapsed. Patients gambled, on average, on about two activities, and the most prevalent was slot machines, on which they gambled predominantly on a regular basis. All of them were classified as disordered gamblers based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-Fifth Edition [30] criteria for GD and following the classification of gambling problem severity based on various instruments used in the different health services such as the South Oaks Gambling Screen (SOGS) [31, 32] , used in three of the four services, the Canadian Problem Gambling Index [33, 34] , employed in one service, and the Kurzfragebogen zum Gl\u00fccksspielverhalten [35, 36] , applied in one out the four services. The participants could be mostly classified as Pathways 1 and 2 according to the Pathways Model [37, 38] . About 40% of the patients had comorbidities, the most widespread of which were depressive disorders and personality disorders, following the DSM-5 disorders classification. ",

Gambling frequency and problem gambling were assessed through the SOGS [31, 32] as it was the most widely used measurement instrument for gambling problem severity classification across the four health services involved in the study, which is consistent with what happens in the National Health Drugs Services in Italy [36] . The SOGS is a 20-item questionnaire based on the DSM Third Edition [39] criteria for problem gambling. It is a widely used screening instrument for problem gambling and shows good reliability and validity in community and clinical samples [40, 41] . For the study purposes, we omitted the non-scored items 2 and 3, investigating the largest amount of money ever gambled with on any one day and parents' gambling problems, respectively. We also modified the original time frame by referring to the last month. The first item of the SOGS investigated the frequency of gambling (not at all = 0, less than once a week = 1, once a week or more = 2) in ten activities, including playing cards for money, betting on horses, dogs or other animals, sport bets, dice games for money, casino, betting on traditional/instant lotteries, bingo, stock and/or commodities market bets, slot machines, poker machines or other gambling machines and games of skill for money. To obtain further information about gambling frequency, also by taking into account the specificity of the lockdown period in the closure of legalized gambling venues, we also included online games for money and private bets with friends and family members. Based on their responses to those items, participants were classified as non-gamblers (no gambling behavior) or gamblers (gambling on at least one activity; [42] ). Among gamblers, non-regular gamblers (i.e., those who participated less than once a week in at least one gambling activity) and regular gamblers (i.e., those who participated once a week or more in at least one gambling activity) were identified [43] . A total score of gambling frequency (range: 0-24) was obtained by summing the responses for each activity. To have a measure of problem gambling, the responses to the items investigating gambling problem symptoms were summed. An example of the items is: \"Have people criticized your gambling?\" Each of those items required a dichotomous answer (i.e., yes = 1 or no = 0), except three items, which have a 4-point or 3-point response scale dichotomized (i.e., never = 0, some of the time (less than half the time)/most of the item I lost/every time I lost = 1; never (or never gamble) = 0, yes, less than half the time I lost/yes, most of the time = 1; no = 0, yes, in the past, but not now, yes = 1) in the scoring phase. A cut-off score of 5 or more indicates that the respondent is a PG [31] .",

The analyses showed that only one patient increased the SOGS total score (\u2206SOGS = \u22123), while all the others had positive \u2206SOGS values; thus, there had been a decrease in problem gambling symptoms. In particular, the mean value of \u2206SOGS was 9.29 (SD = 3.70, range: \u22123-17). We also observed that this delta value was significantly correlated to the total years under treatment (r = 0.43, p < 0.01), having open spaces in the house (r = 0.37, p < 0.05) and the number of reasons for exiting the home (r = \u22120.47, p < 0.001).

Thus, a more robust treatment pathway and a domestic environment that favors open spaces were associated with a higher decrease in problem gambling symptoms, while going outside for a lot of reasons seems not to favor a change.

This result is particularly challenging considering that during the lockdown, several online gambling companies around the globe announced record numbers of people signing up and gambling. Various explanations of this fact are possible, depending on whether we focus on a clinical sample of problem gamblers being treated at services such as ours or on the overall population of gambler customers of online platforms. In fact, our patients were mostly land-based EGM-disordered gamblers. In line with Avanzi and colleagues [52] , their preferred game may not have been interchangeable for them, they may have low skills with technology and, at the same time, family control may be greater during this period. Moreover, they could benefit not to be triggered by online gambling advertisements, forbidden in Italy since 2019 [53] . Instead, concerning the general population, data on online gambling released in Italy refers to an increase in cash revenue without knowing whether it is determined by the same gamblers who invested more money during lockdown than before or if there was an increase in the number of customers, or both. Regardless of the lockdown, a general constantly growing trend of online gambling revenue, notably +35% in the last three years, had already been registered in the last few years in Italy [54] .",

In fact, almost no PG symptoms were found, with the exception of the awareness of having a gambling problem and the sense of guilt because of gambling.

Martinotti and colleagues [56] , assessing an Italian sample affected by substance use disorder during the COVID-19 lockdown, also found low craving and explained it by \"a perceived lack of availability of the substance that interrupted the development of the craving priming as well as decreased social pressure on this group of subjects\" [56] (p. 6).

Gainsbury and colleagues [57] found that compared to the other groups, among land-based gamblers, there was a higher proportion of PGs than in online gamblers, and land-based gamblers were also most likely to play electronic gaming machines weekly, with this form of gambling contributing to problems at a substantially greater rate. Restrictions on the general availability of land-based gambling, on who can gamble and on how gambling is provided are indeed best practices to prevent problem gambling [14] , and our study shows that PGs might be effectively supported in their recovery if they are restricted and not allowed to gamble. St-Pierre and colleagues [58] , in their review about the influence of availability and accessibility of gambling opportunities on problem gambling, noted that even though there is no robust evidence that increased availability and accessibility of gambling contribute to the prevalence of gambling pathology and problems, there is also no convincing evidence to the contrary.

This is an unexpected result of our study: having no gambling opportunities available is experienced mainly with a sense of freedom rather than being perceived as a limitation, which gives space to new interests, goals and relationships and family roles. Indeed, a significant number of gamblers reported a general mood of overall well-being. Social relationships in the family improved for half of the patients. The quality of life with cohabitants is, on average, evaluated as positive. These results differed from those found regarding alcohol. For instance, Chodkiewicz and colleagues [59] , in their survey of alcohol-drinking throughout the pandemic in Poland, found that current alcohol drinkers were significantly less able to find anything positive about the pandemic situation and were mentally less able to cope. Those drinking more during lockdown were already heavy drinkers and suffered from worse mental health. They also used substances to cope with stress. Their levels of mental health were also reduced, especially in daily functioning and symptoms of depression. Similarly, Sun and colleagues [60] made the assumption that the COVID-19 pandemic has increased the risk of the abuse of addictive substances and behaviors. They found that relapses were relatively common in ex-alcohol (19%) and ex-smoking addicts (25%); furthermore, 32% of regular alcohol drinkers and 20% of regular smokers increased their usage amount during the pandemic. These three dysfunctional coping behaviors (Internet, alcohol and smoking) during this COVID-19-related crisis appeared to have increased the risk for substance use disorders and Internet addiction in previous consumers.",

Of extreme clinical interest are the perspectives that the interviewees expressed about their future intentions and about the lack of attention that they have experienced with respect to gambling. The images of what they would have liked to do at the end of the quarantine focus on desires common to people who have never experienced gambling addiction (e.g., seeing friends, playing sports, taking vacations, finding or starting work, etc.) but which are not common for PGs who usually have the overriding compulsion to gamble, which annihilates all other desires and projects. This is consistent with the many respondents who have lost interest (11%) or felt they hate gambling (8%) during lockdown. Therefore, the closure and consequent inaccessibility of most land-based gambling opportunities has allowed these patients to return to desire and plan for their future life outside the arcades, away from gambling, reversing that process of polarization of thought and of the whole life focused on gambling, which is the first indicator of loss of control and sliding into GD [68] . Some patients also verbalized the desire to maintain these changes in life.",

Again, this can shed light on the process of relapse, from both a preventive and a clinical perspective. In our clinical sample, relapses during the lockdown period are associated mainly with an inhomogeneous treatment pace and with the traumatic experiences associated with COVID-19. In this context, we have observed that stress and negative emotions act as triggers, but mostly in patients who had unstable gambling abstinence. Most interestingly, the small subgroup that had a relapse was composed only of patients who were habitual gamblers of those options that were still available during the lockdown (scratch cards, online gambling and the stock market) and had grieving experiences; on the other hand, there was no shift to other forms of gambling for all the other patients. Thus, environmental influence plays an important role in relapse and has a crucial role in potentiating the effects of the treatment and allowing different forms of coping with stressful situations.",

            "text": "Some interesting findings that emerged from the study also highlight some general difficulties experienced by gambling patients during quarantine. Some of what Browne and colleagues [69] call \"legacy harms\" were also found (i.e., harm to the individual's emotional state, ongoing guilt and shame and ongoing financial harm). One in ten had deteriorated social or family relationships. This could be explained by the fact that in some households, there are additional issues that aggravate the conflict between members (e.g., tensions and domestic violence, but also economic problems that carry over from the period of heavy gambling). In fact, economic problems may also have worsened during the quarantine period, despite the suspension of gambling behavior: economic concerns, in addition to the decrease in work and the economic crisis due to the pandemic, may be linked to the fact that the gambler can no longer count on the income from before and therefore may not be able to pay previously open debts that continue to arrive (for example, the payment of loan instalments previously requested from financial companies). This can result in feelings of malaise, economic worries and anxiety. Symptoms of ongoing disordered gambling awareness and guilt also persist, regardless of not having gambled during the quarantine period. The sense of guilt, disappointment, anger and remorse for the lost money remains high; the other dominant feeling is indifference to gambling. In line with what Volkow said [66] , it is therefore necessary to continue supporting and monitoring addicted gamblers in recovery and their concerned significant others, compensating the limited access to meetings of peer-support groups or other sources of social connection with other forms of support. Although face-to-face interaction is a key feature of recovery support, virtual meetings may be useful for those with access to the Internet, and enhancing virtual resources to minimize office visits appeared to be an effective strategy for supporting patients during the quarantine period.",

Nevertheless, our sample is wide and representative of the PGs who turn to addiction services for help. Moreover, it was possible to compare the SOGS scores before and during quarantine for only 44 patients, since the measuring instruments administered to the intake by the various addiction services differed, and because the adherence to the study by the services occurred when the lockdown had already begun. Therefore, it was not possible to agree on univocal measures pre-and post-enrolment of the patients in the research design. Nevertheless, all patients had received a diagnosis of GD according to DSM criteria. For the same reason, we did not have a measure of severity of the immediate period before the lockdown. Finally, it was not possible to compare our data with a control sample, given the simultaneous closure of almost all gambling opportunities in Italy.",

Since 2019, an Italian law [53] prohibits commercial advertising for gambling, and we assume that this may probably have facilitated the reduction in craving of gamblers. Therefore, it is necessary to at least provide forms of voluntary self-exclusion and imposed exclusion for pathological land-based gamblers, according to the evidence from the numerous efficacy studies carried out in casinos, venues and online betting sites and virtual casinos in terms of harm reduction for this vulnerable population [81] [82] [83] [84] [85] . This study suggests preventive effects of substantial reductions in supply in the field of games of chance. Consequently, a substantial reduction in the number of gambling opportunities in Italy should be considered as justified from a research perspective: public policy should therefore consider every form of quantitative restriction or strict limitation on the supply of games of chance as a component of the regulation of gambling for the purpose of protecting the gamblers, especially those belonging to vulnerable categories.
