The urgent need to steward scarce resources and maintain social distancing has led to the postponement of elective surgeries and the downsizing of inpatient care teams. This has significantly impacted medical training at every level. For plastic surgery residents, the reduction of hands-on surgical training is particularly pertinent given the increasing levels of sophistication of plastic surgeries in the past decade and the high clinical volume of elective procedures. Knock-on impact on training competencies and progression remains to be seen, but a review acknowledged by the General Medical Council shows a decline in skills in 6-18 months [1] . As for medical students, canceled electives may have denied students insight, interest and mentorship in the field [2, 3] , which is aggravated by the limited inclusion of plastic surgery in the medical curriculum.",

Technical skills encompass both physical examination techniques and surgical proficiencies. The opportunity to perfect physical examination techniques, especially key to procedures wherein precise measurements are fundamental, such as measuring topographic distance and tissue compliance, may be scarce [12] . Yet the increasing incorporation of artificial intelligence and 3-dimensional printing to compute accurate measurements in digital consultations during the pandemic may circumvent this [12] . Surgical proficiency, dependent on both psychomotor and cognitive capabilities, may be affected [13] . To augment these cognitive processes, virtual tools that aid visualization of topographic anatomy and step-by-step guidance of surgical procedures such as the Anatomage Table and Touch Surgery, may be useful adjuncts [14] . Some institutions have also adopted simulation-based education, and proposed live-streaming surgeries upon patient consent using encrypted web-based communication [15] [16] [17] . As for interpersonal skills, concerns over the lack of digital empathy may allow new terrains of professionalism to be explored and improved upon [18] .",
