The campaigns may be run by governments and public health bodies but are also deployed by biopharmaceutical companies. Industry-sponsored disease awareness (DA) campaigns intend to provide information about diseases and their prevention or treatment, without mentioning specific products. In most countries, DA campaigns fall outside of the laws and regulations that apply to promotion of medicines. Currently, guidance for industry is limited and only exists at national level. This article provides an overview of existing guidance on DA campaigns, discusses benefits and risks, and proposes recommendations for industry-sponsored vaccination awareness campaigns.",

These campaigns commonly use posters, and media channels such as television, magazines or newspapers, websites, and social media. They provide information about a health-related condition and how to recognize, prevent or treat it. The aim is to trigger a change in behavior with a view to improving public health. Governments or public health institutions sponsor campaigns to enhance health by addressing risky behaviors, such as tobacco smoking, or to encourage the uptake of healthcare, such as cancer screening. Increasingly, DA campaigns are also sponsored by biopharmaceutical companies for diseases for which the company has specific expertise, as, for example, in vaccinology, and hence can contribute to public health.",

            "text": "Currently, there is no regulatory framework or harmonized guidance to ensure ethical conduct of DA campaigns related to vaccine-preventable diseases. Nevertheless, as shown during recent disease outbreaks and epidemics, there are significant knowledge gaps and even misinformation on vaccines and vaccination, leading to low vaccine confidence driven by a mix of psychological, sociocultural, and political factors. 1, 2 In the particular context of the global COVID-19 pandemic, vaccine rejection has been most strongly correlated with public distrust of vaccine benefit, and also correlated with concerns about commercial interests from pharmaceutical companies and preferences for natural immunity. 3 In this paper, we focus on vaccination awareness campaigns (VACs), i.e., DA campaigns related to vaccine-preventable diseases, sponsored by biopharmaceutical companies and directed toward the general public. We begin with an overview of existing regulatory frameworks and guidelines. This is followed by a general discussion of the benefits and risks of VACs. Next, we propose practical considerations to guide ethical conduct of VACs based on our experience at GSK. Finally, we invite companies to share their experiences with a view to strengthening the public health impact of industry sponsored DA campaigns. Disease information directed at healthcare providers (HCPs), specialists or patient representatives; press releases from companies; promotional product campaigns or linked disease awareness and promotional product information are all out of scope of the current paper since they represent specific and distinct ethics issues.",

            "text": "DA campaigns are distinct in tone and intent from promotional campaigns that are focused on selling specific products. As such they fall outside of regulations on promotion. Promotion of medicines directed to the general public, known as direct-to-consumer advertising (DTCA) of prescription medicines, is only allowed in New Zealand and the US. In common with all the other countries, Europe prohibits the advertising of prescription-only medicines to the general public. European Directive 2001/83/EC does, however, permit the supply of information to the public on health and diseases, provided there is no direct or indirect reference to a pharmaceutical product. 4 The Directive makes particular reference to vaccination campaigns carried out by the industry: where these are approved by the competent authorities of the Member States, the prohibition of promotion of prescription medicines is not applicable. Canadian authorities, in contrast, permit reminder advertisements which mention the product name but not the indication, as well as 'help-seeking announcements' which present only the medical disorder, but do not refer to a drug product or manufacturer. 5, 6 DA campaigns are not subject to specific requirements of the US Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations, or of EU Directive 2001/83/ EC. Neither do the FDA or the European Medicines Agency (EMA) provide any specific guidance on the topic. They are also out of scope of international and regional industry associations' codes of practices -their focus is on interactions with HCPs, medical institutions and patient organizations, not the general public. Other regulations such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in Europe and national legislations apply only to specific aspects, for example, protection of data privacy regarding the use of pictures of patients in the DA materials.",

[16] [17] [18] DA campaigns are part of companies' strategies to encourage patients to seek help for medical conditions for which prescription drugs are available. 5 There is evidence that patient requests for medication subsequent to DA campaigns may influence doctors' prescription behavior and this raises concerns that warrant ethical recommendations. 19 Arguments made in favor of DA campaigns include the promotion of patient autonomy and improved public health thanks to increased diagnosis, better management and treatment of rare, serious or debilitating diseases, as well as destigmatization of diseases (e.g., HIV) or embarrassing symptoms (e.g., erectile dysfunction). 15, 16, [20] [21] [22] The Israeli Ministry of Health established regulations regarding DA campaigns to specifically empower consumers by providing them with information about the availability of treatments for diseases (medications or preventive treatments) in a manner that does not involve the promotion of a particular commercial product. 21 Criticism of DA campaigns points at overdiagnosis as a result of so-called disease mongering, a term originally referring to the medicalization of ordinary life, used by Moynihan and colleagues as \"extending the boundaries of treatable illness to expand markets for new products.\" 23 This practice has been linked to the medicalization of normal health and aging, and consequently the risks linked to overtreatment. 5, 15, [22] [23] [24] In the case of DA campaigns for vaccine-preventable diseases, concerns over disease mongering are not considered directly relevant since they may entail a risk of overstating disease seriousness and its consequences but not overdiagnosis per se.",

Nevertheless, one study reported a majority of respondents also supposed that the intent of DA campaign is to sell more medicines. 18 Thus, the intent should be substantiated by evidence of the target audience's need to be informed from the outset of campaign design. This need or knowledge gap can be identified through surveys or literature review, with the aim to establish precisely what information should be supplied to address this need and result in a health benefit for the public.

Where a DA campaign is related to a condition for which the sponsoring company is the only one with a product on the market, concerns about DA activities being a covert form of advertising become relevant. In this particular context, the MHRA Blue Guide recommends that 'extra care' is needed. Similarly, the now-withdrawn FDA draft guidance mentioned that the company is not automatically disqualified from conducting a DA campaign in that situation, provided it does not implicitly identify a particular drug or device. In Canada, help-seeking announcements should not imply that a drug is the sole treatment available. Alternative preventative measures besides vaccination may also exist and should be mentioned.",

For this reason, measurements of campaign success should reflect measures of individual and societal benefit, in terms of addressing knowledge gaps in the target audience, or in associated public health outcomes. Social media and websites offer opportunities to measure levels of public engagement by capturing metrics on how often posts are shared, commented on and liked, and how many times links are clicked. In the US, DA campaigns on social media reportedly show high levels of consumer engagement. 29 However, research studies evaluating the effectiveness of health awareness campaigns sponsored by governments or not-for-profit organizations indicate a variable impact on increased information seeking behavior between campaigns. 30, 31 Social media engagement and information seeking behavior were used as proxy for the public's increased understanding of a disease in those studies. Surveys and 'social listening' of mentions on social media around the disease topic can be used to learn about the impact of the campaign in the context of the wider information environment. Further studies of measurement of success of DA campaigns' impact on public awareness should be encouraged.",
