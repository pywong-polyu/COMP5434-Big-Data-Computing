In this survey paper, we describe how the internet is transforming the mathematics classroom and mathematics teacher education. We use as references several reviews of use of the internet in mathematics education settings made in recent years to determine how the field has evolved. We identify three domains in which new approaches are being generated by mathematic educators: principles of design of new settings; social interaction and construction knowledge; and tools and resources. The papers in this issue reflect different perspectives developed in the last decade in these three domains, providing evidence of the advances in theoretical frameworks and support in the generation of new meanings for old constructs such as 'tool', 'resources' or 'learning setting'. We firstly highlight the different ways in which the use of digital technologies generates new ways of thinking about mathematics and the settings in which it is learnt, and how mathematics teacher educators frame the new initiatives of initial training and professional development. In this survey paper, we identify trends for future research regarding theoretical and methodological aspects, and recognise new opportunities requiring further engagement.",

At the time of finalising this special issue, the entire globe is in the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic. Because of the extreme relevance of online and blended learning programmes at the current time, an editorial on the timeliness of this issue will be included in this special issue. Since the 1970s technology has changed mathematics education and it will certainly be a major factor in how education in the future differs from education today. Educators realise that we need to rethink the entire model of education and redesign it so that it is more student-centred. This means adopting new technologies, but it also means giving up on certain attitudes about what constitutes educational success. These new technologies also seriously influence the nature of mathematics, e.g., application of procedures is becoming less important and new ways of validation (and practising in general) in mathematics are being developed. However, it is beyond the scope of this special issue to explore this matter in depth.",

These topics also gave rise to new theoretical developments. The exponential development of interactive digital devices, and the use of the internet in teaching mathematics and online learning environment since the last special issue, support the need to frame some of these initiatives developing in the world (Borba et al. 2013; Borba et al. 2016; Trouche et al. 2013) .",

This development brings us the possibility of two-way communication via the internet, and enhanced opportunities for collaborative learning. It also brings us the personalisation of the internet through personal devices. The role of social media is becoming increasingly important, moving the education process from a 'push' to a student-centred 'pull' approach in which the students become an integral part of many facets of the process (Martinovic et al. 2013) . Furthermore, the introduction of digital resources and tools questions the efficacy of current teacher practices and traditional classrooms Gueudet and Pepin 2020) . Social aspects of the internet become more and more relevant and notions such as 'humans-with-media' emphasise that if media are changed, the entire knowledge-acquiring process may change . Moreover, as humans develop and construct new media, these media seem to transform and 'construct' a new human.",

Currently it seems clear that digital technology is 'deconstructing' the notion of the classroom. Flipped classrooms change the notion of what is in and outside of the classroom, and also change the roles of students and teachers. There is a profusion of online resources (e.g., widgets, videos), designed with respect to specific mathematical content, which transforms the presentation of content and allows students access to solving mathematical tasks and sharing their mathematical explorations. Our students also have to evaluate the quality of the knowledge disseminated over the internet-they need to be able to select valid resources.",

It seemed odd to write about digital technology, without connecting it to the current situation, which strongly impacts the world-wide use of digital technology in teaching. On the one hand, the worldwide lockdown increases the rate of change of using digital technology in education but at the same time it creates an awareness of the need to feel connected to each other. Rather than rewriting the paper, we added a section at the end in which we 'blend' the formal conclusions of the paper with questions and doubts that arose from the 'agency' of COVID-19, or that were catalysed by it.",

Technology and internet networks are allowing the design of courses for a large number of participants and in ways that were not available in more traditional contexts (Silverman and Hoyos 2018) . Different large-scale professional development programmes have been adapted to impact practice (Carney et al. 2019 (Avineri et al. 2018) , opening up the possibilities for teachers to engage in a variety of learning opportunities. Scaling up of professional development is concerned with how the programme is implemented across multiple instructors and settings and about the participation effects, such as course participants' changes in practice. Some initiatives focused on identifying factors that contribute to the sustainability and scaling up of professional development (Goos et al. 2018) , recognising that examining their impact is complex, and lacking solid frameworks to explain learning in open online settings (Joksimovic et al. 2018) . Digital technologies allow new approaches to design, implement and analyse large scale professional development and determine the influence on teacher practice and student achievement (Bell et al. 2010) . For example, the internet allows development of new approaches through which it is possible to support the sustainability and scaling up of professional development focused on the introduction of dynamic technologies in using Web-based toolkits (Clark-Wilson and Hoyles 2019). The growing activities of designing MOOCs and using blended learning approaches are defining new issues related to how design principles can be generated. Borba et al. (2016) mentioned MOOCs as a relevant theme, as follows:",

Blended learning recognises the need for peer interaction and practical application in order to bring learning to maturity. Blended learning engages students since it offers them an opportunity to develop their own opinions, consider new ideas in collaboration with other students online, and try out their own ideas in a relatively anonymous environment (Holley and Oliver 2010) .",

The construction model is formed by four types of activities: activation, analysis, institutionalisation and practice. The authors underline that the design principles allow participants to have a high level of autonomous self-directed online learning and have learning opportunities to unpack and analyse elementary mathematics from a teaching perspective. Three general principles are used to design and analyse the implementation of this programme: the constructivist view of learning; contextualised problem-based learning, and that the teaching of mathematics requires specific knowledge. These principles are operationalised during the design, for example by means of the design of online activities around contexts operating as a general frame to problematise various aspects of the content.

They analyse the design principles underpinning the development and delivery of a blended learning programme of professional development for out-of-field teachers of secondary school mathematics in Ireland. Three theoretical frameworks informed their analysis of the blended learning design. The first framework examines definitions, dimensions, and rationales for blended learning, the second framework characterises out-of-field teaching as a boundary-crossing event, and the third concerns effective teacher professional development using structural and core features. They integrated these frameworks within a blended learning context, attempting to find out how such an environment contributes to effective professional learning for out-of-field mathematics teachers. They found that engagement is long in duration and intensive among participants, but also learnt that epistemic considerations must be addressed when professional mathematicians engage with school mathematics teachers in curriculum development. For example, the nature of blended learning deserved more attention because a better appreciation could lead to better learning opportunities and outcomes for teachers.",

Joubert, Callaghan and Engelbrecht (2020) conducted a study in which they presented a blended mode course in the use of technology in teaching to practising teachers from different subject fields, including mathematics. The purpose of this course was to develop teachers' knowledge and skills in the use and integration of mobile technology in their teaching. In their study they investigated how lesson study can be adapted into a blended format to support isolated teachers who cannot meet face-to-face on a regular basis, using an Learning Management System (LMS) to communicate. They identified aspects that should be incorporated into a blended lesson study process to support isolated teachers in teaching with technology.

Developments trialled included online quizzes for changing attitudes and teaching foundational concepts, online lecture options in addition to face-to-face lectures, the adoption of what they called board tutorials (a technique that supports peer-topeer learning and improves engagement), and learning outcomes supported by a problem-solving approach for more complex engineering modelling problems and online interactive problems. The individual student could determine the amount of blending. They found online quizzes to be a useful tool that, coupled with supporting material, can level the playing field in relation to the assumed knowledge for students transitioning to university. In addition, the use of online quizzes of foundational knowledge efficiently replaced a myriad of potential time consuming tutor-student conversations, such as diagnosis, feedback, independent work and the re-assessment, which would be impractical in a face-to-face environment. Quinn and Aar\u00e3o also used board tutorials, changing the passive tutorials from 'mini-lectures', to experiences that both students and teachers valued highly. Quinn and Aar\u00e3o argue that successful implementation of blended learning in first year mathematics occurs when one automates as many of the routine conversations between teacher and student as possible, and reserve what tutor-student interaction time you have for high-impact face-to-face learning activities such as board tutorials and for supporting project work.",

In their research on instructional technology, Pepin et al. (2017) found that many studies on the topic are predominantly framed by socio-cultural theories underlining the role of discourse in learning. The development of information and communication technologies has undergirded the emergence of new forms of discourse and has the potential to change social relations and the ways through which we come to understand the development of knowledge (Llinares and Olivero 2008; Llinares and Valls 2010; Clay et al. 2012) . Interaction in online contexts allows us to consider the links between the processes of meaning construction and of participation underpinning learning. The links between construction of meaning and participation is scaffolded by social artefacts or tools, such as online collaboration, mind mapping or sharing narratives in online forums to discuss relevant aspects in mathematics teaching. Sharing interaction spaces, such as those that facilitate asynchronous 1 online discussion, creates opportunities for participants to reorganise their knowledge in the course of the social interaction. In this sense, the affordance of new media helps participants to communicate knowledge in multimodal ways generating different ways of discourse. Different theoretical perspectives about learning and knowledge have been used to understand the links between interaction in online contexts and the construction of knowledge to conceptualise technology-mediated interaction (Clay et al. 2012; Goos and Geiger 2012; Llinares and Valls 2010) . Recently, new perspectives have emerged that consider how newly introduced media reorganise human thinking, favouring connections and group discussion ). These approaches underline that media act and interact in knowing when participants interact collaboratively (in blended or online contexts). It is assumed that the nature of the interface between participants affects the potential for knowledge building (Borba and Llinares 2012) . The notion of knowledge construction in collaborative settings assumes that the nature of participation and content of discourse is related to how the process of construction of knowledge is developed. One aspect here is the different forms of discourse that the participants adopt, and how participants create points of focus around a nexus that organises the negotiation of meanings. The media inserted in the specific online context can provide different ways of articulating the discourse for the participants to notice, represent, interpret or use theoretical elements. Two papers in this special issue focus their attention on different ways of articulating the discourse in collaborative contexts, namely, the construction of collaborative mind maps, and sharing and discussing narratives about teaching in an online forum. These two different types of discourse generated in collaborative online contexts focus the participants' attention on meanings, combining participation and reification processes. In these initiatives, several aspects of mathematics knowledge for teaching emerge, and mathematically significant pedagogical opportunities for mathematics teaching that builds on student thinking.",

The specific context is an undergraduate blended course in a primary teacher education programme in Canada, including the use of different tools for online collaborative mind mapping activities. The theoretical frame underlines the notion that new media reorganise human thinking. In this case mind maps are understood as ways of visualising mathematics education knowledge that is collectively constructed, and the different technological tools are used as means to support and organise topics, creating visual connections and inserting other different semiotic representations such as videos or images. The analysis of artefacts created by the prospective teachers (mind maps) and the flux of interaction during the construction process enabled Cendros-Araujo and Gadanidis to report on a grounded theory of knowledge building through mind mapping. They describe how pre-service mathematics teachers construct knowledge when they interact through online collaborative mind mapping and how the different technical characteristics of the tools impact on the reorganisation of knowledge by the different means of discourse. In this case the technological tools in a collaborative context allow new ways of knowing to be shown through a new type of discourse-such as integrating the visual and text, and combining graphical, narrative and symbolic realisations.",

In this case, narratives of his/her own teaching are the artefacts that allow a prospective mathematics teacher to reify what is noticed on each occasion. The context is an online distance teacher education programme in Costa Rica aimed at developing the competence of prospective teachers to identify mathematically significant pedagogical opportunities (MOSTs) in order to build on student thinking. In this intervention, integration of thinking and doing is evident when prospective teachers reason about the teaching events in order to decide how to act. This paper shows two features of how online social interaction influences the development of teaching competence, such as noticing. The first feature is defined by the role of writing and sharing narratives in an online forum, and the second is defined by the role of feedback as a way of interactive collaboration. In this case, the development of noticing was related to aspects of discourse (communication processes) such as identifying MOSTs, providing more details of students' thinking and providing explicit reasons behind the prospective teachers' actions.",

These ideas are supported by the description of stages of knowledge building through mind mapping-introducing a topic, building a concept, and making sense of the whole picture-and by the ways in which the MOSTs are taken advantage of, and by the reasons given for the prospective teachers' actions. These ideas conform to the approach called humans-with-media, developed by Borba and Villarreal (2005) . Furthermore, collaborative construction of mind mapping and sharing narratives of their own teaching can be seen as resources for thinking and communicating knowledge when participants are attempting to build new knowledge. The papers underline three relevant features, as follows. Firstly, how the media supporting social interaction can deploy several semiotic possibilities, giving forms to different types of discourse. Secondly, how sharing and co-creating tools generate the context in which participants can compare and share their ideas and justify and evaluate their arguments. Finally, the role played by cognitive scaffolding such as feedback from others and prompts to carry out the activities. These features help us to understand a little more about the relationships between social interaction in online environments and the knowledge construction and development of teaching competence.",

They ground their discussion in social semiotics, a theory that considers the context of production and the negotiations between actors, to analyse how the production of videos in the classroom can help in the communication of mathematical knowledge and in the change of the dynamics in the classroom. They found that video production provided a classroom dynamic in which students could become protagonists of the teaching and learning process, with teachers mediating this activity. They argue that video production is a different way to express mathematics, and it is particularly well-suited to expressing what students have understood. Using videos, a new kind of mathematics can emerge in the classroom, integrating its traditional symbolic language with other modes, such as language, gesture, image and music. In production of the videos, students showed their understanding of the content, and through this activity, the students themselves became aware of their difficulties and sought ways to overcome them. In this sense, video production assists in encouraging students' discussion and reflection about content and its exposition to produce meaning and promotes a change in the dynamics of the classroom, breaking the barrier between the classroom and the outside world. This activity is seen as a new, emergent facet of education, in which the student searches for content outside the classroom.",

They made use of self-reports, complemented with the analysis of students' solving of mathematics tasks, supported by the use of monitoring software. They found that students manifest instrumental help-seeking behaviours mostly associated with the procedural items of the task. A general pattern of behaviour, manifested by the students who participated in the study, was dominated by the use of search engines and keywords to identify sources of mathematical help. They observed how the internet and its resources were fundamental for some students to seek for help, and that, with this help, students were able to successfully solve a mathematical task on a topic partially unknown to them, which could be interpreted as a positive development of a self-regulated learning strategy. However, some students only used appropriate keywords to perform the help-seeking process-so students could find ways to solve mathematical tasks in which there was no need to exert a priori reasoning about the structure of the task or the nature of the mathematical situation at stake, before deciding on specific algorithmic procedures.",

As many researchers predicted, it now looks as if a blended, changing classroom is taking shape.

Together with these approaches, we still have (and it seems necessary) to have traditional instruction in many instances.

Besides, technology is seen as having agency. Digital technology is saturated with humanity in its design and in its conception, and humans are impregnated by technology, and in particular digital technology. Souto and Borba (2018) showed examples of how the third generation of activity theory may be transformed by the notion of humans-with-media as agents of production of knowledge. From the theoretical perspective of human capital and activity theory (Souto and Borba 2018) , artefacts, community, and subjects are separate vertices of the multiple triangle diagram that illustrates activity in a social approach. Souto and Borba (2018) show examples of the internet being community and subject. The notion of humans-with-media, which has as one of three pillars the first generation of activity theory, with the notion of reorganisation of thinking (Tikhomirov 1981) , may now transform the current, and more thorough third generation of activity theory.",

When students do not have control over what is taught but do have control over what is learnt (Tu et al. 2012) , they create a PLE, a collection of all tools they use for learning, thereby enabling a student-controlled integration of myriad learning tools and services into a personalised space (Bidarra and Ara\u00fajo 2013) . The idea of a personal learning network (PLN) is related to the concept of a PLE. PLNs extend the PLE framework to include an informal learning network of people with whom to connect for the specific purpose of learning (Borba et al. 2016) . In a PLN there is an understanding among participants that they are connecting for the purpose of active learning (Lalonde 2012) . Although these environments are not commonly used in mathematics education yet, they are well-known concepts in other disciplines, such as computer science. It is envisaged that, in the foreseeable future, an increasing number of students and institutions will embark on this route of collaborating online to support their learning.",

Adaptive hypermedia is an alternative to the traditional 'one-size-fits-all' approach in the development of hypermedia systems, in that they build a model of the goals, preferences and knowledge of each individual user and this model is used throughout the interaction with the user in order to adapt to the needs of that particular user (Brusilovsky 1996; Kurilovas 2016) . In a learning situation, a student in an adaptive educational hypermedia system could be given a presentation that is adapted specifically to his or her knowledge of the topic (Hothi et al. 2000) and the most relevant links to proceed further will be suggested (Brusilovsky et al.1998b; Kavcic 2004) .",

Mohan (2013) predicted that the future of all student education-from kindergarten to post-graduate level-will be hyper-personalised. Each student will focus on having their own teacher, their own curriculum and their own books or other resources. In such an environment, the teacher, using adaptive hypermedia, will increasingly become a person who understands the unique needs of each student. Not all students in a class will be at the same level. Some might surge ahead in mathematics while others in literature or art.

We have labelled that a \"domestication of a new media\": one does not take advantage of the agency of a new medium and simply uses practices from teaching with the old medium (Borba and Villarreal 2005) .",

It is not easy to design well for effective, meaningful learning in this environment, and hurried, incomplete and rushed efforts to 'teach online' can give blended and online learning a bad name, associated with managing student protests rather than for pedagogical innovation (Czerniewicz 2020) . Robin DeRosa (in Kamanetz 2020) pointed out that creating a good online course can take years of development and collaboration, involving people with different skills. She claimed I think the first thing is, we are not building online courses or converting your face to face courses to online learning. Really, what we're doing is we are trying to extend a sense of care to our students and trying to build a community that's going to be able to work together to get through the learning challenges that we have. \u2026. so if people think that in three to five days they're going to rejigger their course and build some super amazing online platform, that's probably unlikely to happen.

This approach encourages students to select and transform information, discover principles, make hypotheses and decisions beyond the given information (Jung and Latchem 2009) . Students can become involved in the design and development as well as the delivery of curricula (Lightner et al. 2007 ). An environment that supports the development of communities and collaborative discussion opportunities can assist students to comprehend and synthesise information, as independent and critical thinkers (Jansen et al. 2011) .",

Pull approaches are characterised by constructivist and connectivist models-some of which are created by students, as in socially shared environments (Willems 2009). In these models students demand, request, and even create the particular products or information that they need.
