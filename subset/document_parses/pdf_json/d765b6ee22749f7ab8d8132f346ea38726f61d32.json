            "text": "Background and aims: Previous studies have reported that stronger avatar identification and negative self-concept are associated with gaming disorder (GD). This study aimed to examine the value and significance of avatars based on firsthand accounts from regular and problematic gamers, and to identify any potential links between avatar-related experiences and excessive gaming. Methods: An online survey of 993 adult gamers yielded 3,972 text responses. Qualitative analysis of 59,059 words extracted 10 categories of avatar-related perspectives. Results: Some problem and non-problem gamers employed sentimental language (e.g., 'dear friend', 'like a child', 'part of my soul') to refer to their avatar. However, most participants perceived avatars as a means of achieving in-game goals and enabling greater interactivity (e.g., socializing). When asked to reflect on hypothetically losing their avatar, participants generally anticipated feeling temporary frustration or annoyance due to lost time and effort invested into the avatar. Although some participants reported that their avatar 'mattered', avatars were often considered as superficial ('just pixels') and peripheral to the primary reinforcement of achieving in-game rewards and objectives. Some broader psychological and identity issues such as gender dysphoria, rather than 'addiction', were cited as motivating persistent avatar-related interactions and attachment. Discussion and conclusions: Participants reported diverse views on the psychological value and function of avatars, but the relationship between avatars and problematic gaming or GD was largely unclear or inconsistent, and refuted by some participants. Future research with clinical samples may lead to a better understanding of player-avatar processes, including whether avatar-stimuli facilitate the development of maladaptive gaming habits, particularly among psychologically vulnerable players. Future investigations should be mindful of 'overpathologizing' avatar-related phenomena and recognize their important role in socializing, storytelling, and creative expression among gamers.",

            "text": "Video games offer increasingly sophisticated interactive experiences (Billieux et al., 2015; King, Herd, & Delfabbro, 2017; King, Koster, & Billieux, 2019; Lemenager, Neissner, Sabo, Mann & Kiefer, 2020) . Avatars are one of the important elements of gaming that enhances this interactivity (Gilbert et al., 2014; Sibilla & Mancini, 2018; Vasalou & Joinson, 2009 ). In basic terms, avatars are the player representations that are projected into immersive digital environments (Bailey, West, & Kuffel, 2013; Bessi ere, Seay, & Kiesler, 2007; Trepke & Reinecke, 2010) . Avatars can be human or non-human, realistic or stylized, and customized to alter personal attributes and appearance. Avatars may enable experimentation with idealized aspects of self that might not be possible in the real world (Allison, Von Wahlde, Shockley, & Gabbard, 2006; Forsyth, Chesla, Rehm, & Malone, 2017; King & Delfabbro, 2014; Przybylski et al., 2012) . Certain games that focus on avatars are generally referred to as 'role-playing' games, such as massively multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPGs) (Smahel, Blinka, & Ledabyl, 2008) . However, almost all types of games (e.g., sports and racing, shooters, strategy and puzzle games) can include avatars and roleplaying options (Ducheneaut, Wen, Yee, & Wadley, 2009; King & Delfabbro, 2019) . Although many player-avatar interactions confer personal benefits (e.g., enjoyment, creativity, identity exploration), avatar features have recently been the focus of survey-based and neuroimaging studies into the development and maintenance of problematic gaming (Green, Delfabbro, & King, 2020; Lemenager et al., 2020) .",

            "text": "It has been suggested that some gamers may form a kind of psychological attachment to their avatar (Dengah & Snodgrass, 2020; Li, Liau, & Khoo, 2011; . This relationship has been described as a \"strong emotional bond\" (Mancini, Imperato, & Sibilla, 2019) , a \"powerful psychological component of the gaming world\" (Stavropoulos, Dumble, Cokorilo, Griffiths, & Pontes, 2019) , and important to an \"individual's personal narrative, psychological wellbeing, and self-conception\" (Wolfendale, 2007) . Further, avatars have been proposed to fulfil important needs and be \"far more than mere online objects\" (Wolfendale, 2007) , enabling gamers to project unconscious thoughts and express suppressed versions of their psyche (Stavropoulos, Gomez, Mueller, Yucel, & Griffiths, 2020) . Many of these experiences fall under the umbrella term of 'avatar identification', defined as \"the temporary alteration in selfperception of the player induced by the mental association with their game character\" (Van Looy et al., 2012; p. 206 ). Avatar identification is often a positive or desired experience, as avatars enable identity expression, storytelling, and immersion in the gaming world (Hussain & Griffiths, 2009; Klimmt, Hefner, & Vorderer, 2009; Whang & Chang, 2004) . However, avatar identification has also been significantly linked with excessive gaming (Mancini and Sibilla, 2017; Sioni, Burleson, & Bekerian, 2017; Smahel et al., 2008; You, Kim, & Lee, 2017) and depressive mood (Bessi ere et al., 2007; Burleigh et al., 2018; You et al., 2017) , suggesting that this phenomenon may affect the general well-being of players in different ways.",

Survey-based studies of gamers have reported significant positive correlations between avatar identification and excessive gaming (Mancini et al., 2019; Smahel et al., 2008; You et al., 2017; Zhong & Yao, 2013) . Some researchers have even argued that avatar identification should be added to the definitional criteria of gaming disorder (e.g., in the DSM-5 or ICD-11). For example, Sioni et al., 2017 reported that avatar identification may be \"a valid indicator in diagnosing GD\". Other studies have included recommendations that clinicians explore the \"relationship between their client's identity inside and outside of the game in relation to their use of avatars\" , examine an avatar's characteristics to \"provide a subtle (or obvious) glimpse into players' unconscious processes\" (Sioni et al., 2017) , and that \"virtual demographics, such as the Draenei race\" [in the game World of Warcraft] should be carefully considered when preventing and treating problem gaming\" (Morcos, Stavropoulos, Rennie, Clark, & Pontes, 2019) . These recommendations, if followed, may alter the standard procedures and provision of mental health advice and services, and thus warrant critical examination.",

A guiding theory in this area has been self-discrepancy theory (see Higgins, 1987) which proposes that people have multiple selves (i.e., actual, ought, and ideal selves). Selfdiscrepancy theory suggests that people can experience a lack of fulfilment and distress when there are large discrepancies between these selves, and some researchers have suggested that using avatars to generate an alternative selfidentity may help resolve such discrepancies. There is growing quantitative evidence on the topic of avatars and problem gaming exploring this possibility (Green et al., 2020; Lemenager et al., 2020) , including survey-based and neuroimaging studies (Choi et al., 2018; Dieter et al., 2015; Kim et al., 2018; Lemenager et al., 2014 Lemenager et al., , 2016 , but relatively few qualitative (e.g., interview, case report) studies (Allison et al., 2006; Gilbert et al., 2014; Hussain & Griffiths, 2009) .",

Very few case reports or other detailed accounts on this topic exist and many of the available studies are now relatively old (e.g., Allison et al., 2006; Chappell, Eatough, Davies, & Griffiths, 2006; Griffiths, 2010; Lee, 2011; Lee & Shin, 2004 ) and predate the current mental health classifications of GD in the DSM-5 and ICD-11.

These questions enabled participants to elaborate on the standard measures of gaming behaviour (i.e., frequency, preferences), avatar-related activities and preferences (i.e., questions concerning avatar choice, number, attributes, and customization), game and avatar identification (i.e., Player Identification Scale; Van Looy, Courtois, De Vocht, & De Marez, 2012) , and problematic gaming (i.e., IGD checklist; Petry et al., 2014) . All participants responded to at least one open-ended question; however, some responses were quite short (e.g., \"yes\", \"no\", or \"yeah, it does\"). The average word count for written responses was 14.8 words, with more elaborate responses generally between 100 and 250 words. All written responses (3,972 responses; N 5 59,059 words) and the data codebook are available in the supplementary file (https://docs.google. com/spreadsheets/d/19y8VW4oVFIhg6oUxFOL3LJbklXIoHl_ vg7wxE2OtyoY/edit?usp5sharing).",

For example, the item measuring tolerance states: \"Do you feel the need to play for increasing amounts of time, play more exciting games, or use more powerful equipment to get the same amount of excitement you used to get?\" Response options are dichotomous (Yes/No). A score of 5\u00fe indicated problematic status.

To gather information about gamers' views of the perceived importance of avatars in connection to identity, and whether any avatar-related experiences were relevant to personal experiences of problematic gaming, four open-ended questions were developed. Questions were: (1) How do you generally think or feel about your avatar? Does your avatar matter to you?, (2) How would your life be different if your avatar was suddenly deleted?, (3) Have you ever felt like it was hard to control your gaming time because you felt immersed in the experience of playing an avatar? and (4) Do you have any other comments or experiences about your avatar and gaming habits you would like to share?. All questions were developed by a registered clinical psychologist (third author) and were designed to be openended to elicit longer or elaborated responses. These questions were designed to be relatively neutral (i.e., avoiding direct reference to avatar identification and related concepts, as well as gaming disorder).

As per the COREQ reporting guidelines (Tong, Sainsbury, & Craig, 2007) , we declare that we are male and female researchers, including two males with PhDs with 10\u00fe years of research experience and the third who is a female registered psychologist (Masters-level qualification). Further, no relationship was formed with participants prior to this study, and no personal information about the researchers except for their institution details was provided. Participants provided all responses in written text format and were not provided with further opportunities after the study to revise their responses. Qualitative data were transposed to a single document. The most salient information and categories were identified by the first author, who initially coded the datafile and shared the coding with the senior author who checked and either modified or confirmed the coding. This involved assigning category labels to individual text segments that were repeated across the datafile . The senior author suggested minor revisions to the names of some of the categories and subcategories and to combine two of the subcategories due to their close similarity. There was strong agreement (i.e., at least 95% agreement) between the two raters on the assignment of content to categories. The first and senior author then reread the coding document and made additional changes to the coding document and exchanged this with each other on two further occasions between January and March 2021 which led to total agreement on the categories. All written content was analyzed at the same time and given equal attention in the coding process to ensure an inclusive and comprehensive process. Another document was created to store a list of all identified categories, as well as record a series of relevant extracts illustrating each category (see Supplementary file 1). This process yielded 3 main categories including 10 subcategories in total (Category 1: The personal value of avatars, including subcategories of emotional connection (n 5 91 quotes), tool or facilitating goal pursuit (n 5 93), realworld self-expression (n 5 80), representation of an 'ideal self' (n 5 34), sunk cost reasoning (n 5 170), and narrative and role-play value (n 5 101); Category 2: The unimportance of avatars, including subcategories of superficiality and irrelevance (n 5 188) and differentiated from real-world self (n 5 25); Category 3: The importance of game world and context, including themes of avatar value depends on game genre (n 5 25) and immersion in the world, not the avatar (n 5 53). Responses from problem and non-problem gamers were blinded during the initial coding process, but then re-identified to enable separate examination of problematic gamers' material. Extracted quotes in Section \"Results\" include identifiers (i.e., gender, age, GD status) that were added after the analysis. Thus, the presented thematic analysis was not biased toward potentially extracting themes specific to any potential judgements or preconceptions related to problem gaming.",

Accessing and progressing the game's narrative and interacting with in-game characters were other common goals. Avatars allowed people to socialize, role-play, and interact with other players in the game (e.g., I use them for role-playing within middle earth, and as a medium to socialise with my friends within the game [F, 25, Norm] ). Participants used their avatar to advance through the game (e.g., Game progression is linked with the avatar [M, 41, Norm]) and test their skills against opponents (e.g., I use it to be competitive in the game [M, 32, Norm]).",

My avatar is someone I wished I was in reality, a white blonde girl [M, 28, GD]; The vast majority of the time, I play as characters off my identified gender to help relieve my dysphoria [F, 24, Norm] ; It's who I'd like to be, I think I may suffer from gender dysphoria [M, 29, Norm] ). The creation of avatars (representing another gender) allowed individuals to explore different roles and identities (e.g., As someone who is questioning my gender, it's nice to be able to play as the opposite one in videogames [Other, 22, Norm] ). However, exploring the opposite gender was also related to basic curiosity and experimentation; as one participant stated: \"I see my avatar as an opportunity to imagine myself in what-if scenarios. The most common being: What if I was a woman? I tend to identify more with the female cast of a game, even though I am quite comfortable in my identity as a male in real life.\" [M, 31, GD].",

In this sense, participants rationalized the value of the avatar in terms of sunk cost, as determined primarily by game time (sometimes hundreds of hours) or in-game progression (e.g., levels) and, to a lesser extent, actual effort or skill requirement (e.g., My main attachment to the character is due to time investment and progression status [M, 25, GD]; They matter to me, but only because of the time invested in them [M, 26, Norm]; I've been playing the same character since I was 10, so I have lots of positive emotions and memories associated with it [F, 18, Norm]). There were 20 references to having spent money on the avatar (e.g., Realistically, I've probably spent over a year of real-life time playing the game and well over $3,000 [M, 31, GD]). These aspects were reiterated in response to the question regarding the potential consequences of deleting the avatar; as one participant noted \"I would be sad, not so much because of me losing the character's looks but the time spent achieving the levels, items, currency and other milestones. We are talking hundreds of hours down the drain\" [M, 28, Norm].",

They matter to me in that I care about the story [F, 28, Norm]; They matter to me in the sense that I enjoy playing their story, seeing what kind of person they can become [M, 25, GD]).

Some participants referred to ways in which their avatar's story might reflect or be influenced by some of their own life experiences (\"I created her at a time in my life when I was very sad and even though I've improved since then, she remains as an outlet for me to express my sadness. She suffers as I have suffered.\" [F, 21, Norm] ).

Some participants (n 5 24) differentiated their real-world identity from their online identity, and made strong clarifying statements to this effect. Avatars were described as separate and distinct from their actual-self, and as having no relationship or influence on their self-concept or vice-versa (e.g., It's not an extension of myself . . . It's just my online game avatar, nothing more nothing less [M, 22, Norm] ; It's a completely separate entity. I do sometimes get thrown when people treat my avatar as if it's me [M, 43, Norm] ; Overall, I have a strong sense of self and I don't place my self-worth on a digital avatar so its impact on my day-to-day life would be minimal [F, 25, Norm] ; An avatar is an avatar. I don't selfinsert into it. . . It's kind of a canvas for whatever aesthetic whims I may have [M, 29, Norm] ). Some participants commented on external views (e.g., statements in the media and games research) about gaming avatars and self-identity (e.g., One thing I've always remarked upon in such articles is how they describe the avatars as if you're trying to BE the avatar. As if you really think you're a wizard in Baldur's Gate or a Jedi or a Hogwarts student. No wonder some people think gamers are weird [F, 39, GD] ). Another participant challenged the notion of avatars expressing or representing self-concept or aspects of gender, age, or race (e.g., The current trend of discussion about \"representation\" in games is a ridiculous one. The avatar in games is not there to represent the player. . . It is a puppet, not part of the player's personality [M, 46, Norm] ).",

Some participants (n 5 24) acknowledged feeling some degree of personal investment in their avatar but that this depended greatly on the type of game. Avatars in massively multiplayer online (MMO) games were perceived as important because the game involved a focus on character development, avatar customization, and role-playing opportunities. Participants developed a stronger 'attachment' to the avatar in MMO games than other games (e.g., My avatar matters to me depending in the genre of game that I am playing. When playing an MMO I feel as if the character is \"me\" and that the character is an extension of myself. However, when playing a MOBA the avatar I control does not feel like \"me\" it just feels like a character I control that has its own personality and actions that are separate from me [F, 22, GD] ; In games like MMOs where a character's name, appearance, and even backstory are yours to create, I have a little more personal attachment to them because I like to come up with characters with compelling personalities and backstories [M, 36, Norm] ). Role-playing games were similarly recognized as games where the user developed a stronger connection with the avatar (e.g., If I play an RPG, it matters and I almost always identify with its actions. For grinding or PVP games, I don't really care for it [M, 31, Norm] ; In first-person RPGs, avatar must resonate with some part of myself. In other games, it is less important [M, 26, Norm] ). Avatar customizability was a feature of these games identified as contributing to avatar attachment (e.g., The more choices I am given in avatar customization the more I can identify with the character [Other, 51, Norm] ; I connected to my customized avatar/character because I made choices that aligned with my own beliefs and thought processes [F, 20, Norm] ).",

It was found that players' views were diverse in regard to the psychological value and function of avatars. However, there were several perspectives that suggested some commonalities across different player-avatar interactions. First, many participants expressed a view of avatars as being the means of achieving in-game goals, referring to the avatar as a 'tool' or part of the medium or user interface that enabled interactivity or manipulation of objects. Players referred to various in-game goals and acts of reward-seeking (e.g., story progress, obtaining rare items, socializing) in ways that subsumed the value or importance of avatar. In other words, the avatar was described as a 'means to an end' rather than the primary reinforcing aspect of the game, although there were instances of reward-seeking that directly implicated the avatar (e.g., obtaining rewards to customize or otherwise improve the avatar).",

The present study found mixed support for this proposition, which was consistent with Sibilla and Mancini (2018) . First, some participants referred to the customizability of avatars and how this allowed them to explore different desirable traits and expressions, which may be viewed as an idealized version of their real-world self. However, many participants who reported these experiences were frequent but non-problematic gamers, indicating that these 'attachments' were commonplace in gaming and may not be specific to problem gaming experiences. A study of user-avatar bonds by Stavropoulus et al. (2020) , whose sample (N 5 1022 MMO gamers) was comparable to the sample in the present study, proposed a subtype of 'fused' players. Fused players referred to individuals whose identity was 'fused' to their avataras measured by the endorsement of statements including \"Both me and my character are the same\" (Blinka, 2008) . The authors explained that fused players \"tended to present with real-life behaviours more impacted by their online avatars, while concurrently tending to be more immersed with their avatar in game action, and to use avatars more as a mean to compensate real-life deficits\" (p. 8). Lemenager et al.'s (2020) systematic review also referred to 'fusion' in stating \"the individual increasingly fuses with the virtual world and accordingly fosters an idealized virtual self-concept\".",

Across all the written responses (59,059 words) there were no explicit references or allusions to self-identity being 'fused', 'joined', 'coupled', 'united' or 'combined' with their avatar (or identity being 'shared', 'the same', or 'overlapping'). However, consistent with previous empirical studies Mancini et al., 2019; Morcos, Stavropoulos, Rennie, Clark, & Pontes, 2019; Sioni et al., 2017; You et al., 2017) , some players referred to feelings of 'attachment' and 'connection', which were clarified as simply meaning 'liking' the appearance or other attribute of the avatar or part of becoming immersed in the game world or narrative. Based on these diverse views, it is not clear whether certain survey items in previous studies that measure certain strong perceptions of avatars necessarily capture these views effectively or may be over-interpreting (or, attributing too much importance to) the semantics of language that attempts to convey embodiment in a virtual representation (e.g., \"my character is an extension of myself\"; Van Looy et al., 2012; \"Both me and my character are the same\": Blinka, 2008 ; \"I see things differently when I play with another character\": Stavropoulos et al., 2020) . For example, it could be that some gamers may endorse some avatarrelated questions if these items refer to a close (but inaccurate) approximation of their avatar beliefs. This may then result in researchers misconstruing the importance of the avatar and/or citing the endorsement of these items to explain dysfunctional gaming behaviours, particularly in the absence of alternative explanations or data (e.g., sunk cost, comorbidities, self-regulation issues). Future research employing cognitive interviews and survey measures to determine how participants interpret certain items in standard survey tools may be a helpful next step.",

In particular, some participants related their avatar identification to gender identity-related issues not directly related to gaming disorder, such as the desire to transition to the opposite sex. In this way, gaming may enable gender and identity experimentation as a way of coping with distress about gender identity and may be only one of several contexts in which this experimentation is occurring in the person's life. Another potential issue is the role of third or unmeasured variables. For example, in studies that report associations between measures of avatar identification, problematic gaming, and general psychological distress (e.g., the DASS-21) it is possible that other factors (e.g., self-regulation difficulties, impaired control) may account for the association between all these variables.",

These participants explained that their avatars did not have personal or sentimental value (e.g., based on terms such as 'meaningless pixels', 'empty vase', and 'a bunch of 1s and 0s'). This was consistent with our previous qualitative study of regular and problematic gamers who viewed rewards in games as \"artificial and worthless\" when asked to reflect on their importance (King et al., 2017, p. 529) . In this study, participants referred to appealing avatar attributes but clarified that these were gameplay features that enable exploration and progression. Participants explained that some games (e.g., social online games, role-playing games) had a greater focus on avatars and related features (social interaction, customizability) but that avatars alone did not elicit immersion into the game. Rather, in-game immersion was attributed to the synergy of game elements (e.g., world, story, rewards). These views suggest that it may be reductionistic to attribute immersion to the avatar independent of other in-game features, in the same way that books and films do not rely solely on their characters for immersion.",

However, this study had several limitations. First, the responses were obtained anonymously online. While this approach increased the likelihood of honest self-disclosure, it may have lacked the validity of face-to-face and telephone/web-based interviewing. Second, the sample was predominantly composed of adults, and therefore results may not generalize to adolescents, for whom issues of identity may be particularly salient. Third, data collection occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic, which may have impacted the way in which participants reported on their avatar-related views and relationships (e.g., minimizing its importance in the context of various stressors and shifting priorities) Kiraly et al., 2020) . Finally, although participants often provided sufficient clarification, the study lacked follow-up questions and the capacity to prompt participants for further detail or clarification.",

These data highlighted diverse views concerning the value of avatars and their function in gaming. Although many respondents reported that avatars were a useful vehicle through which to enhance game narratives and progression, they were also considered superficial, replaceable, and largely unrelated to self-concept. Some participants reported anticipated regret at the prospect of losing all their time and money invested in a gaming avatar, but there was no clear indication that the avatar itself was linked to the development or maintenance of persistent or problematic gaming. The relationship between avatars and problematic gaming or GD was largely unclear or inconsistent, and refuted by some participants. Future research with clinical samples may help to gain a better understanding of avatarrelated processes, including how avatar-stimuli may establish gaming habits under certain conditions, such as in relation to vulnerabilities including low self-regulation or poor inhibitory control. This research suggests that researchers should be cautious about suggestions to include avatar identification as a symptom of IGD in the DSM-5 (Sioni et al., 2017) , particularly in the context of efforts to streamline GD to its most clinically valid and representative form (Castro-Calvo et al., 2021) . Such proposals may 'overpathologize' gaming (Billieux, Flayelle, Rumpf, & Stein, 2019) and negate the important role that in-game avatars play in socializing, storytelling, and other creative activities in recreational gaming. One would also need to ensure that any strong self-identification with avatars was not otherwise accounted for by other psychologically meaningful issues confronting the gamer at the same time.",
