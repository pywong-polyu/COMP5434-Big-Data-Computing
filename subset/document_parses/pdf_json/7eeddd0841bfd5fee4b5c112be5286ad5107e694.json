Therefore, as a remedy, T\u00fcrkan and \u00d6 zel (J Appl Stat 43:1892-1905 , 2016 ) examined the performance of almost unbiased ridge estimators for the Poisson regression model. These estimators will not only reduce the consequences of multicollinearity but also decrease the bias of PRRE and thus perform more efficiently. The aim of this paper is twofold. Firstly, to derive the mean square error properties of the Modified Almost Unbiased PRRE (MAUPRRE) and Almost Unbiased PRRE (AUPRRE) and then propose new ridge estimators for MAUPRRE and AUPRRE. Secondly, to compare the performance of the MAUPRRE with the AUPRRE, PRRE and maximum likelihood estimator. Using both simulation study and real-world dataset from the Swedish football league, it is evidenced that one of the proposed, MAUPRRE (k q4 ) performed better than the rest in the presence of high to strong (0.80-0.99) multicollinearity situation.",

            "text": "The Poisson regression model (PRM) is a special form of the generalized linear models and is used when the dependent variable is collected in terms of counts of nonnegative integers. A PRM adopts a Poisson distribution for the dependent variable and assumes the log of its expected value can be modeled by a linear combination of relevant parameters. The model is commonly applied for counts such as the occurrence rate of an event (counts) per unit of time. These counts must be independent to facilitate that one count will not make another event to be more or less likely. Instead, the probability of a count per unit of time is related to independent variables such as, e.g., the time of day. Examples of likely Poisson processes could be the number of infected patients per day at a clinic, a country's number of bankruptcies per year, the number of vehicles per hour passing through a freeway toll. The maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) is used to estimate the unknown regression coefficients of the PRM. This estimator is considered to be the best estimator for the PRM, and as long as under-or overdispersion is not present in the data set, this is a standard model for these types of count problems. However, in the presence of multicollinearity problems, the mean square error (MSE) of the MLE become unstable with high variances of the regression coefficients and the inference based on MLE may not be reliable. Another consequence of multicollinearity is the wider confidence intervals, decreased statistical power which result in increased probabilities of type II errors in the parameters' hypothesis tests. In addition, the uncertainty of the estimated coefficients is higher because of an increased coefficient variance due to multicollinearity.",

            "text": "Many biased estimation techniques have been proposed for linear regression models to reduce multicollinearity, such as the ridge regression estimator by Hoerl and Kennard (1970) and the Liu estimator by Liu (1993) . Moreover, Nomura (1988) developed an almost unbiased ridge estimator in the linear regression model, thus with the cost of a very low bias, but substantially more efficient as compared to the ordinary ridge regression under certain conditions. M\u00e5nsson and Shukur (2011) proposed a Poisson ridge regression estimator (PRRE) to reduce the effects of problems associated with multicollinear data. Kibria et al. (2015) proposed a number of biasing parameters, and Asar and Gen\u00e7 (2018) suggested a two-parameter biased estimator in the PRM to adjust for multicollinearity. T\u00fcrkan and \u00d6 zel (2016) developed Almost Unbiased PRRE (AUPRRE) and Modified AUPPRE (MAUPRRE). Ka\u00e7\u0131ranlar and Dawoud (2018) examined the performance of Poisson and negative binomial ridge predictors. Algamal and Alanaz (2018) proposed different methods to estimate the value of ridge parameter (k) for PRRE. Rashad and Algamal (2019) proposed a new ridge regression approach in the PRM to reduce the issue of collinearity between explanatory variables, and recently Qasim et al. (2019) proposed a Liu-type of regression estimator for the PRM. T\u00fcrkan and \u00d6 zel (2016) did not discuss the MSE properties of AUPRRE and MAUPRRE and not derive the optimal value of the ridge parameter (k). However, no published research work seems available regarding the MSE properties of the AUPRRE and MAUPRRE and their optimal ridge estimators for the PRM.",

Second is, by simulations and by the empirical application in terms of MSE and bias, to compare the performance of the MAUPRRE with the AUPRRE, PRRE and MLE. In addition, we introduce new estimating methods for estimate the value of ridge parameter (k) for AUPRRE and MAUPRRE and the performance of proposed ridge estimators is compared with the existing estimators by considering different factors in the simulation study. Furthermore, the intuitive, and empirical relevance of the MAUPRRE and AUPRRE are exhibited by employing an estimation of a real-world dataset, where we systematically investigate which estimator that to the highest degree can remedy the effects of multicollinearity. In this empirical application, we model the number of goals scored at away games (as a function of the quality of the teams measured by bookmaker odds). By this approach, it is easily demonstrated that the standard errors and the estimated MSEs of proposed estimators are decreased substantially as compared to the existing estimators in the presence of multicollinearity problem. Hence, the precision of the estimated parameters is increased, which of course is one of the main objectives of demonstrating the method in an empirical situation.",

The performance of the estimators is inspected by changing different factors such as the sample size, multicollinearity level and the number of explanatory variables. From Tables 2 and 3, it is clear that the MSE of all the estimators decreases as the same size increases, while the value of MSE is increased when the degree of correlation is increased. However, the MLE has a larger MSE than the PRRE, AUPRRE and MAUPRRE. Table 2 reveals that estimators behave differently with respect to multicollinearity levels, and it is seen that the performance of proposedk q4 is better than the other estimators. The performance ofk q1 \u00c0k q3 is not superior to thek TO when q 0:95 and q \u00bc 3. In the presence of high but imperfect multicollinearity, the proposed ridge estimatorsk q1 \u00c0k q4 are superior to the MLE andk TO . From Table 3 , when Table 4 Estimated absolute Bias values when q Table 4 and 5.k q4 give minimum bias as compared to other estimators. However, the performance of MAUPRRE is satisfactory in the sense of having the smallest bias (almost unbiased) when we usek q4 in MAUPRRE. As the sample size and the number of explanatory variables increases the absolute bias of the estimators is decreased. However, the multicollinearity level has a negative effect on the performance of the estimators. Overall, as expected, we can see that the estimated MSE and bias of the estimators increase due to the increase in the multicollinearity level, but the effects of multicollinearity are least problematic when using our new MAUPPREk q4 \u00c0 \u00c1 . The AUPPREk q4 \u00c0 \u00c1 provides minimum bias when sample size small and q \u00bc 3. As q \u00bc 6, n ! 1 and q ! 0:99, the performance of MAUPPREk q4 \u00c0 \u00c1 is superior to other estimators in the sense of absolute bias. Finally, when looking at the simulation results, the greatest benefit of applying MAUPRRE is in the situation when ridge estimatork q4 is used.",

This dataset includes n \u00bc 242 observations which include one dependent and six explanatory variables. These variables are defined as: number of, within full time, away-team goals (y), pinnacle home win odds x 1 \u00f0 \u00de, pinnacle draw odds x 2 \u00f0 \u00de, pinnacle away win odds x 3 \u00f0 \u00de, maximum market home win odds x 4 \u00f0 \u00de, maximum market draw win odds x 4 \u00f0 \u00de and maximum market away win odds x 6 \u00f0 \u00de. The effects of the regressors x 1 to x 6 \u00f0 \u00deon the dependent variable are analyzed using the PRM. The distribution of the dependent variable is illustrated in Fig. 1 which indicates that the PRM is well fitted. Based on a Chi-square v 2 \u00f0 \u00de goodness of fit test, the results confirm that the response variable is well suited to the PRM (with a p value = 0.15). The correlation matrix of the regressors is exhibited in Table 6 . Table 6 shows severe correlation among x 1 , x 3 , x 4 and x 6 . Furthermore, the condition number, which is the ratio of maximum to the minimum eigenvalues, is 1766 [ 1000 which indicates what can be defined as a severe multicollinearity problem in this dataset.",

The effects of the estimated coefficients are changed, and the estimated standard errors of theb MAUPRRE are smaller than those ofb AUPRRE ,b PRRE , b MLE . It is evident from Table 7 , based on high standard errors, that the MLE does not estimate the coefficients very precisely in the presence of multicollinearity. However, on the other hand, the proposed estimation method b MAUPRREkq4 \u00c0 \u00c1 estimates the coefficients rather precisely. The PRRE provides smaller standard errors as compared to the AUPRRE and MLE. The AUPRRE gives higher standard errors of the parameters since AUPRRE provides minimum squared bias and MSE among other estimators under certain conditions. AUPRRE shrinks the bias, and therefore, we named it almost unbiased estimator due to its minimized bias. One can easily see that in the presence of multicollinearity MLE exhibits the wrong sign of the slope parametersb 3 andb 6 . However, biased estimation methods may change the sign of the slope parameters. For instance, theoretically, pinnacle away win odds and maximum market away win odds have negative effects on the number of fulltime away-team goals, while the MLE shows a negative effect. Meanwhile, proposed method shows positive effect and it is considered a good approach to tackle the problem of multicollinearity. Hence, the advantage of the proposed method over MLE using this empirical application is easily understood.",

In Fig. 2a , we plot the squared bias values of the PRRE and AUPRRE for changing the values of the ridge parameter k between 0 and 1. It is seen that AUPRRE has always the minimum bias compared to the PRRE, and these results satisfy Theorem 3. Fig. 2c . It is found that the MSE of the biased estimators equals to MLE when k \u00bc 0. As the value of k increases, the MSE of MAUPRRE demonstrate the minimum MSE compared to the AUPRRE, PRRE and MLE. Therefore, we can conclude that the performance of the PRRE, AUPRRE and MAUPRRE is a function of the values of the ridge estimators. Overall, we recommend practitioners to apply MAUPRRE with ridge estimatork q4 since this estimator gives lowest standard errors and MSE in the presence of multicollinearity. ",

We also derive the optimal ridge parameter, k by minimizing the MSE of AUPRRE and suggest new ridge estimators. These estimators are based on the proposed optimal value of k for estimating of the ridge parameter, k, which we demonstrate to exhibit superiority over the existing estimators. The comparison of the proposed estimators is made using the AUPRRE, PRRE and MLE by means of Monte Carlo simulations. The comparison concludes that MAUPRRE with the ridge estimatork q4 has a smaller MSE than MLE, PRRE and AUPRRE. Moreover, the empirical relevance and appealing properties of the proposed estimator are also demonstrated by utilizing our approach on a collinear real-world application. In conclusion, both empirically and by using simulations, in the presence of multicollinearity our MAUPRRE (k q4 ) approach exhibits the lowest MSE compared to all competing estimators.",
