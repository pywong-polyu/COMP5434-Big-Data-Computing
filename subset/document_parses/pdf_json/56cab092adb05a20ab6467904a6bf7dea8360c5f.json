This variant was estimated to be responsible for more than 96% of cases reported between January and June 2021, being associated with increased transmissibility and disease severity, a reduction in neutralization antibodies and effectiveness of treatments or vaccines, as well as diagnostic detection failure. Here we show that, following several importations predominantly from the USA, the Delta variant rapidly replaced Gamma after July 2021. However, in contrast to what was seen in other countries, the rapid spread of Delta did not lead to a large increase in the number of cases and deaths reported in Brazil.",

Data from this initiative shows that after July 2021 the Delta variant has become highly prevalent. It has been suggested that the Delta variant might be more transmissible 9 , having led to public health emergencies in other countries due to overwhelming increases in the number of cases, hospitalizations and deaths when compared to previous circulating variants. Here we describe how Delta became the predominant SARS-CoV-2 variant in Brazil, rapidly replacing the previously dominant Gamma, and how this displacement was not associated with an increase in reported case numbers or deaths.",

The first epidemic wave was characterised by the circulation of multiple SARS-CoV-2 lineages (among them the B.1.1.28 and the B.1.1.33), as a direct consequence of multiple independent introduction events between February and March 2020 (Fig.1A) 11 . By the end of October 2020, even with the implementation of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), a second wave associated with a dramatic resurgence in cases and death numbers took place. This wave was fuelled by the emergence and circulation of several Variants under Monitoring (VUM), such as P.2 (i.e., Zeta), and some VOCs including Alpha and later Gamma (i.e., P.1), which became widespread by January 2021 and dominated the viral population for nearly 8 consecutive months ( Figure 1A ). Despite the national vaccination rollout beginning on January 17th 2021, the COVID-19 death toll in the country steadily rose in March 2021, reaching a peak in April 2021 (Fig. 1A ). This was followed by a decrease in the number of daily cases and deaths by April ( Fig. 1A and Fig. S1 ), likely as a consequence of a gradual increase in population immunity. Zeta (P.2) mostly dominated the first epidemic wave persisting up to March 2021 when it was replaced by Gamma (P.1) (Fig. 1C ). This period was characterized by an upsurge in the number of total cases with a peak registered between February and June 2021. The Alpha variant was also detected from January 2021 onwards, but it remained at a very low frequency nationally (less than 2%) 12 .",

Delta first spread in the southeast, the most populous region of Brazil harbouring the largest urban centres and airports with highest national and international travel flows, that continued to operate throughout 2021 13 . Throughout July 2021, Delta rapidly displaced Gamma, becoming the dominant variant circulating nationally during August 2021 ( Fig. 1A and Fig. S1 ). This variant displacement was not associated with a concurrent increase in COVID-19 incidence (Fig. 1C) . We estimate that Delta had a growth advantage of 0.064 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.058-0.071) per day compared to Gamma ( Fig. 1B) . Assuming that the variants have the same generation time of 5.2 days 14 , this corresponds to a growth advantage of 33% (95% CI 30-37%) per generation of viral transmission, which is in good agreement with earlier findings based on sequence data from multiple countries 15 .",

We estimated that in Brazil, Delta had a transmission advantage of 33% (95% CI 30-37%) compared to Gamma. The spread of future variants will be possible if they exhibit increased transmissibility or immunity evasiveness, both of which seem likely in the case of the Omicron variant 8 .

These were put in their phylogenetic context through comparison with a globally representative (n=13,261) set of other SARS-CoV-2 Delta variants from around the world, sampled from October 23th 2020 to October 23th 2021. The full set of sequences were aligned with NextAlign 29 to obtain a good codon quality alignment against the Wuhan-Hu-1 universal reference sequence. The subsequent alignment was then used to infer a Maximum Likelihood tree topology in IQTREE2 30 (-m GTR, -b 100). Transfer bootstrap support for splits in the topology was inferred using Booster 31 . The resulting consensus ML tree topology was assessed for molecular clock signal in TempEst 32 . Potential outlier sequences or sequences lacking required metadata (e.g. date and location of sampling) were pruned off the topology with the ape package 33 in R prior to dating. The branches in the ML-tree topology were then converted into units of calendar time in TreeTime 34 using a constant rate of 0.0008 substitutions/site/year 35 with a clock standard deviation of 0.0004 substitutions/site/year. Following the dating of the phylogeny we annotated the tips and internal nodes using the \"mugration\" package extension of TreeTime and then counted the state changes from one country to another and their inferred time points. This gave us the number and time of SARS-CoV-2 Delta isolates entering Brazil over time. To obtain a measure of confidence in the time and source of viral transitions, we performed the discrete ancestral state reconstruction on 10 bootstrap replicate trees. .
