A study conducted by the College of Surgeons of the Academy of Medicine of Malaysia revealed that 70% of scheduled medical operations in Malaysia were cancelled as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The SARS-CoV-2 Surgical Collaborative study with the University of Birmingham in the United Kingdom demonstrated that the most strongly affected procedures were those for benign diseases (81.5%), followed by oncologic surgery (41%) and obstetric procedures (26.1%) [3] . It was also found that patients with SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) who underwent surgery experienced worse postoperative outcomes. The mortality rate among postoperative patients without SARS-CoV-2 was under 1%, whilst it was 16.2% among patients with SARS-CoV-2 requiring minor surgery and 18.9% among those requiring elective surgery [4] . Currently, the number of cases in COVID-19 in Malaysia is declining, but we COMMUNICATION COVID-19 plastic surgery recovery plan: The Malaysian experience should always remain vigilant for any surge in cases. Until a vaccine becomes available, all surgical specialities will have to follow a new norm. With the reduction in new COVID-19 cases, the time has come for us to re-commence elective plastic surgical services. However, the re-introduction of services will have to follow strict standard operating procedures and guidelines. This is essential to protect health care workers (HCWs) and to avoid overburdening the health care resources of the country.",

In Malaysia, out of 12,787 samples that were taken, only 0.1% of patients sampled were positive for SARS-CoV-2 [2] . Since re-establishing services is essential for maintaining public health, we propose the following, as shown below in Fig. 1 . Patients are categorized into two categories, low and high probability, based on screening for their travel history, contact history (clusters/residential areas), and symptoms (upper respiratory tract infection, fever in the last 14 days, shortness of breath, anosmia). Only patients in the high-probability group are screened for COVID-19, and should they test posi- tive, HCWs will be required to operate in full personal protective equipment (PPE) and to use a powered air-purifying respirator in the operating theatre. Patients with a low probability of having COV-ID-19 undergo surgery as scheduled, with HCWs gowned in normal PPE with the addition of a face shield.",

Patients are then further required to maintain good hand hygiene with the provided hand sanitizer. It is also mandatory for patients to wear a facemask at all times. Further measures adopted to reduce the risk of infection during consultation and outpatient procedures include ensuring that all HCWs receive formal training on donning and doffing PPE [5, 6] .
