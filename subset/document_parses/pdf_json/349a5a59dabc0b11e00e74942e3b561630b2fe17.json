            "text": "Many farmers hesitate to adopt new management strategies with actual or perceived risks and uncertainties. Especially in ornamental plant production, farmers often stick to current production strategies to avoid the risk of economically harmful plant losses, even though they may recognize the need to optimize farm management. This work focused on the economically important and little-researched production system of ornamental heather (Calluna vulgaris) to help farmers find appropriate measures to sustainably improve resource use, plant quality, and profitability despite existing risks. Probabilistic cost-benefit analysis was applied to simulate alternative disease monitoring strategies. The outcomes for more intensive visual monitoring, as well as sensor-based monitoring using hyperspectral imaging were simulated. Based on the results of the probabilistic cost-benefit analysis, the expected utility of the alternative strategies was assessed as a function of the farmer's level of risk aversion. The analysis of expected utility indicated that heather production is generally risky. Concerning the alternative strategies, more intensive visual monitoring provides the highest utility for farmers for almost all levels of risk aversion compared to all other strategies. Results of the probabilistic cost-benefit analysis indicated that more intensive visual monitoring increases net benefits in 68% of the simulated cases. The application of sensor-based monitoring leads to negative economic outcomes in 85% of the simulated cases. This research approach is widely applicable to predict the impacts of new management strategies in precision agriculture. The methodology can be used to provide farmers in other data-scarce production systems with concrete recommendations that account for uncertainties and risks.",

In general, decision support systems aim to assist a decisionmaker by providing information that is relevant for a given problem so that actionable solutions can be delineated (Burstein & Carlsson, 2008) . Decision support systems can be based on different methods and use various modeling approaches. For instance, supervised learning models like support vector machines (SVM) have been able to provide decision support by enabling early detection of fungal disease symptoms on sugar beet leaves (Rumpf et al., 2010) . Using an argumentation-based approach, Thomopoulos et al. (2015) developed a reverse engineering method (by first setting the goal) to support decision-making in agricultural food chains regarding the impacts of production and storage on food quality. Winter chill models have been applied to predict how climate change scenarios might influence deciduous fruit production and to support farmers' adaptation decisions (Fernandez et al., 2020) . Based on multiple survey data, Wang et al. (2012) forecasted yearly crop yields using a Bayesian hierarchical model as the basis of a decision support system. Bayesian networks have been used to support decision-making in agricultural development contexts, including application of expert knowledge elicitation (EKE) approaches to consider existing risks Yet et al., 2016) . EKE-based decision support was also provided by MacMillan & Marshall (2006) , who applied the Delphi method to guide wildlife conservation management.",

The literature confirms that digital risk management tools such as decision support systems are able to provide farmers with essential information to cope with risks. However, little literature is available on the evaluation of digital risk management tools in horticulture, although the potential of using such tools in combination with expert knowledge to provide decision support in horticulture has been recognized decades ago by Gary et al.

            "text": "Alternative strategies to control plant quality while reducing fungicide use in heather production may incur risks of financial losses due to additional costs and unclear benefits. Heather farmers are exposed to a high risk of financial losses because plants are genetically similar or even identical, and the occurrence of fungal infections can be very dynamic, quickly leading to devastating plant losses (Ruett et al., 2020) . Farmers may therefore hesitate to change their behavior, even if such a change holds a high chance of increasing their income. Distributions of likely outcomes produced by probabilistic analyses can indicate the likelihood of net benefits from adopting new strategies (Rojas et al., 2021) , but they do not account for farmers' individual risk preferences. An analysis of expected utility can deliver decision recommendations for different levels of risk aversion on the part of a decision-maker by transforming probabilistic estimates of possible outcomes into an expected utility value using a utility function (Chavas, 2004; Hardaker et al., 2015) . The concavity or convexity of the utility function indicates individual risk preference profiles, ranging from 'risk-taking, over 'risk-neutral', to 'risk-averse'. Analysis of expected utility can therefore deliver detailed decision support that accounts for the decision-maker's risk preferences (Schaub et al., 2020) . The expected utility of disease control strategies and the level of risk aversion of heather farmers have not yet been investigated. Incorporating risk perceptions and risk preferences into decision support systems is promising and might increase the utility of disease management for agricultural production systems (Gent et al., 2011) .",

            "text": "Monitoring can not only be performed visually by humans but also through the use of sensors, which enable efficient phenotyping of plants and support the detection and investigation of disease patterns . Hyperspectral imaging with optical sensors is a proven tool to detect abiotic stress symptoms (Behmann et al., 2014) and to predict plant compounds such as water, nitrogen, and pigment contents in plants (Ge et al., 2016) . Hyperspectral imaging can also detect biotic stress symptoms induced by fungal plant pathogens (Bohnenkamp et al., 2019) . In ornamental plant production, sensor-based precision agriculture technologies have contributed to risk management by detecting fungal diseases using thermal sensors (Gomez, 2014) and digital cameras (Wijekoon et al., 2008) . Virus diseases have been identified using multispectral cameras (Polder et al., 2014) . Sensor-based approaches have also been applied to heathers, but mainly aimed to analyze flowering phenology (Neumann et al., 2020) and to assess plant compounds (Mac Arthur & Malthus, 2012) rather than focusing on managing production risks. The heather farmers involved in the INRUGA project expressed interest in finding out how well hyperspectral sensors could monitor plant stress, since such tools might enable them to efficiently control plant quality. To assess the potential of hyperspectral sensor monitoring for farmers in ornamental heather production, hyperspectral imaging was applied in a heather production facility. Heather plants were classified according to their health status, based on their spectral signatures. Plants were successfully classified as 'healthy' or 'stressed' with an accuracy of 98.1%, using a Partial Least Squares regression (PLSR) model, which demonstrated the technical feasibility of hyperspectral sensor monitoring for heather production (Ruett et al., 2022) . Since technical feasibility alone does not necessarily correlate with economic viability, Ruett et al., (2022) recommended a detailed cost-benefit analysis that considers the costs incurred in conducting hyperspectral measurements under realistic production conditions. The present work aims to synthesize the results of model-based assessment of more intensive monitoring (Ruett et al., 2020) and the potential of hyperspectral imaging in heather production (Ruett et al., 2022) in the context of an actual farm-scale adoption decision. The central hypothesis is that the willingness of ornamental plant producers to replace prophylactic fungicide applications with sensor-based precision farming strategies depends on their attitude towards risk. The work presented here consists of a joint application of decision support tools containing collaborative group work approaches for elicitation of expert estimates, probabilistic cost-benefit assessment and analysis of expected utility, considering individual risk preferences. Limitations of established decision support systems, which often do not consider farmers' individual risk preferences, can be overcome with this joint approach. Collaborative group work methods are used to engage experts on the respective agricultural production system to frame a conceptual impact model illustrating the expected impacts of innovative practices. Costs, benefits and probabilities are defined as input variables. After experts have been subjected to a so-called 'calibration training', the state of knowledge on the values of input variables to the conceptual model is quantified by experts in the form of probability distributions, which are approximated by confidence intervals. The bounds of these confidence intervals should contain all plausible values (considering 90% confidence intervals) that can appear for an input variable, e.g. the investment costs for new hardware. The conceptual model with quantified variables is then transferred into a digital environment and coded as a decision model to perform probabilistic simulations. Simulation results are then used to conduct sensitivity analyses (Partial Least Squares regression with calculation of the 'Variable Importance in the Projection', as well as analysis of the 'Expected Value of Perfect Information'), and analysis of expected utility with a focus on farmers' individual risk preferences.",

In contrast to risks, uncertainties in decision-making represent situations in which possible outcomes of decisions and the probability of their occurrence are unknown (Tversky & Fox, 1995) . These shortcomings can be overcome by expressing variables using distributions, often specified by lower and upper bounds of confidence intervals that encompass all plausible values (Luedeling et al., 2015) . Calculations with single, precise numbers can easily produce misleading results and give decision-makers a false sense of certainty about the prospects of particular investments. Decision Analysis approaches that work with distributions of all plausible values can overcome these limitations and facilitate decision support for stakeholders while incorporating the uncertainty of actual production conditions (Luedeling et al., 2015) . This article reports on a cost-benefit analysis based on the principles of Decision Analysis (Howard & Abbas, 2015) . This approach is rooted in the premise that it is usually impossible to obtain perfect information on all variables that are relevant for a given decision. It is however possible to estimate plausible ranges and distributions for such missing information based on available knowledge and expert judgement. Using such estimates can help overcome data availability constraints and allow for the assessment of the net benefits of management decisions, even in the absence of perfect data. The ability of experts to provide useful estimates that actually express the state of knowledge on particular variables can be enhanced through a process known as 'calibration training'. From range estimates for all model input variables, the net benefits of particular intervention options can then be computed through probabilistic simulations (Tamba et al., 2021) . ",

Depending on expertise and level of self-awareness, a person may over-or underestimate her ability to estimate variables. For the calibration training, sets of estimation questions were used, asking experts to specify their 90% confidence intervals for the answers in the form of a lower and an upper bound. After each round of estimation exercises, the participants compared their estimates with the correct solutions, indicated how they arrived at their intervals and reflected on how errors may have occurred. Through this reflection process, experts were confronted with their cognitive biases and potential biases in risk perception, motivating them to question the rigor of their quantitative assessment. Experts were taught how cognitive biases affect people's judgment and informed about the 'Dunning-Kruger effect' (Kruger & Dunning, 1999) and 'anchoring effects' (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974) to reduce estimation biases. In addition, experts were taught multiple techniques enabling them to provide accurate estimates of their own uncertainty through reasonable assumptions by using 'Fermi questions' (Tetlock & Gardner, 2015) , imagining a project 'PreMortem' (Klein, 2008) , and applying the 'equivalent bet' method (Hubbard, 2014) .",

The expected utility can be derived from the distribution of possible NPVs using a utility function. This utility function represents farmers' individual risk preferences (from risk-taking to risk-averse) and translates each simulated outcome of the Decision Analysis into a utility value. The expected utility framework was used to simulate certainty equivalents for different levels of risk aversion and different monitoring practices. The decision rule is to identify the strategy that provides the highest certainty equivalent. The certainty equivalent is the amount of money (fixed income) farmers would need to be offered in order to switch from the risky investment to a fixed income.

Thus, their certainty equivalent is lower than the expected value of the risky investment.

Risk-taking farmers have a negative willingness to pay, i.e. they would need an additional external payment to switch away from their risky investment. They thus have a negative risk premium and a certainty equivalent that is greater than the expected value of the investment (Hardaker et al., 2015) . This framework allowed assessing the different monitoring strategies and their corresponding NPV distributions through the lens of farmers along a risk preference gradient.

Maintenance costs required for all monitoring schemes were considered over the entire simulation period.

To date, no clear trend has emerged for the occurrence of high-risk years, which have so far occurred in roughly half of all years. This uncertainty was accounted for by estimating a 90% confidence interval for the chance of high-risk years between 40% and 60%. In normal-risk years, samples are taken less frequently because infection risks are expected to be lower. In high-risk years, more samples are taken and analyzed in laboratories to identify infected plants. This strategy can convey information about the spatial distribution of symptomatic plants within the production system.

For a coefficient of risk aversion of 0, the certainty equivalents of the monitoring strategies are equal to the expected value of the NPV. The monitoring strategy that provides the highest certainty equivalent is the recommended strategy for a given level of risk preference. Results in the upper part of Fig. 3 show that for most of the risk-aversion preferences tested, all monitoring strategies result in negative certainty equivalents. These values imply that decision-makers would not adopt the activity at all. For risk-averse decision-makers, Baseline delivers low positive certainty equivalents in the risk-averse domain (for coefficients of risk aversion between 10 \u2212 6 and 10 \u2212 5 ). This suggests that heather growers in general tend to have rather risk-taking preferences. For risk-averse decision-makers, Improved shows an even lower positive certainty equivalent in the risk-averse domain (10 \u2212 6 ). For application of Sensor, positive certainty equivalents can be observed only in the risk-taking domain (from \u2212 10 \u2212 4 downwards). This implies that from an expected utility point of view, heather production in general and all monitoring strategies considered here are rather preferred by risk-taking decision-makers.

According to Stuart et al., (2020) , prices for hyperspectral sensors can range between approximately 35,000 \u20ac and 116,000 \u20ac. The experts suggested that less expensive sensors of less than 20,000 \u20ac have already proven successful in detecting fungal infections in heather plants (Ruett et al., 2022) . For the simulation, a wide range of price scenarios was covered using a range between 18,000 \u20ac and 100,000 \u20ac (see supplementary materials). Nevertheless, the initial sensor investment does not seem to have a strong impact on the outcome of the UseSensor decision according to the VIP score results (Fig. 5) .

Decision Analysis approaches and analysis of expected utility were used in this study to evaluate what types of farmers (risk-averse or risk-taking) are willing to implement the simulated monitoring strategies in practice, considering existing risks and uncertainties. Analysis of expected utility showed that more intensive visual monitoring is attractive to risk-taking farmers aiming to increase the chance of upside outcomes. Although results suggest that heather farmers are risk-takers, the risk-averse group of heather farmers would be more likely to stick with the occasional-monitoring strategy that is currently practiced. The use of sensor-based monitoring with hyperspectral imaging currently appears to be inhibited by high labor costs associated with sensor measurements. Further research into practical application of sensors should focus on the impact of sensor-based monitoring on the number of marketable plants. In this study detailed management recommendations were formulated for farmers in heather cultivation, a production system in which little research has been conducted so far. The recommendations are based on current knowledge of calibrated experts and allow customized advice to be given to farmers according to their individual risk preferences. This research makes an important contribution to precision agriculture by supporting farmers' decision management, taking into account the overall variability of what might happen in the heather production system as new disease control strategies are applied. This research approach can be used for the analysis of other agricultural systems to provide farmers in data-scarce production systems with concrete recommendations, accounting for uncertainties and risks.",
