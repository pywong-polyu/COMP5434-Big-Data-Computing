            "text": "Enabling self-directed academic and personal wellbeing among learners at school needs to be established as an education priority (Katja et al., 2002; Konu et al., 2002) nationally and internationally to set up a positive foundation for autonomous functioning and flourishing in adulthood (Suldo et al., 2006; Seligman, 2011; Eryilmaz, 2012; Fomina et al., 2020) . Due to a continuous decline in child health and wellbeing globally (Neves and Hillman, 2018; Riva et al., 2020; Paulson et al., 2021) , a focused interest in wellbeing has surfaced on the policy agendas of many nations (Shirley, 2020) . This is plausible considering that international research across eight countries indicates that a third of the school leavers entering university screen positive for emotional wellbeing problems such as depression and anxiety (Auerbach et al., 2018) . With specific reference to South Africa, the country where the research was conducted, the decline in the mental health and wellbeing of school leavers has become serious (Eloff and Graham, 2020) , with 11.2% of school leavers entering university experiencing emotional and mental wellbeing problems (Bantjes et al., 2016) . Particularly, since the emergence of the coronavirus pandemic across the world an increased focus on academic and personal wellbeing has emerged due to the unfavorable and devastating effects of the coronavirus pandemic on among others, mental and physical health and wellbeing (Abbas et al., , 2021a Aqeel et al., 2021; Khazaie et al., 2021; Lebni et al., 2021; Liu et al., 2021; Maqsood et al., 2021; Su et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2021) . The devastating effects compound existing academic and personal wellbeing difficulties Aqeel et al., 2021; Maqsood et al., 2021) . Some of the devastating effects that are of relevance for the article are activated by many unforeseen changes to learners' daily life routines, such as the closure of educational institutions and the switch to virtual education and online learning , as well as social distancing (Aqeel et al., 2021; Su et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2021) .",

Nevertheless, there still seems to be little emphasis on how to support school learners in developing strengths concerning the thinking skills and dispositions they require to become self-directed (Booyse, 2016; Harrington, 2018) . Besides, Kazachikhina (2019) confirms that little attention is paid to explicitly encouraging self-directed learning. Learners for example lack metacognitive skills to self-regulate learning and find it difficult to reflect on and direct their learning to ensure progress (Fashant et al., 2020) . This problem is compounded by teachers who still appear to be using teaching approaches that no longer serve the self-directed roles learners will have to play in the 21st century (Jansen, 2012; Pretorius, 2014; Eyre, 2016; Lotz, 2016) . Patrinos (2020) adds that learners need to possess skills and dispositions to direct and manage their learning progress, establish worthwhile relationships, enjoy a successful and high-quality life, and contribute to a meaningful and reliable society.",

Teachers are obliged to embrace the urgency to reform their teaching approaches to purposefully foreground intellectual and emotional learning (the development of thinking skills and dispositions) that would support the enabling of self-directed academic and personal wellbeing (Klaus, 2015; Bailey, 2016; Obied and Gad, 2017; Uribe-Enciso et al., 2017; Coberley-Holt and Elufiede, 2019) . To this end, the authors postulate that a classroom environment that foregrounds Cognitive Education could dispose learners to conditions that aim to purposefully/intentionally capacitate learners to acquire the thinking skills and dispositions to become self-directed, autonomous thinkers, and lifelong learners (Anderson, 2010; Moonsamy, 2014) . In so doing, the authors contend that the capacity for guaranteeing that the learners can flourish and lead productive and satisfying lives will be built.",

Additionally, Nasri (2017) asserts that although a plethora of research documents the role of learners in the context of self-directed learning, there appears to be a lack of research that probes the teacher's role in the context of developing self-directed learning. This, according to Sebotsa et al. (2019) could be linked to among others, teachers' themselves not being selfdirected, and therefore not enhancing self-directed learning in their classrooms. Geared toward a possible solution for the mentioned problems, this article aims to answer the following research question: How might an intervention in Cognitive Education support in-service teachers in enabling self-regulated academic and personal wellbeing among school learners?",

Despite holding promises for academic wellbeing, Abbas et al. (2019) contend that virtual education also poses negative threats to academic wellbeing. In a negative sense, the unfamiliarity with virtual education, and a lack of proper access to systems that offer e-learning might contribute to anxiety, frustration, stress, and feelings of incapacity that could lead to academic discontent, feelings of dissatisfaction, and academic ineffectiveness. Also, learners might require time to build self-confidence in feeling comfortable with the shift to virtual learning, which might affect emotional wellbeing. The disruption in normal school routine with less face-to-face interaction and more engagement with networking websites and social media could distract focus from academic work (Maqsood et al., 2021) , leading to a decline in academic performance Aqeel et al., 2021) . Conversely, if learners know how to engage adequately with virtual learning, networking websites, and social media their academic wellbeing could undoubtedly be enhanced as they become more immersed in learning experiences through the possibility of interactional communication, collaboration with others, the sharing of information, and receiving support from others during learning (Abbas et al., , 2021b .",

(2019) convey the 21st-century health goals of the World Health Organization for the improvement of wellbeing among the young that encompasses the acceptance of greater social obligation, and in particular personal responsibility for living, perseverance to cope with stress, and establishing meaningful relationships. In the authors' opinion, achieving the mentioned goals requires the ability to increasingly selfdirect behavior and action toward ensuring wellbeing. Helping young people in particular to enable academic and personal wellbeing, self-directed learning appears to be beneficial, as it capacitates learners to autonomously take control over their intellectual/cognitive, motivational, emotional/affective, and environmental/contextual situatedness across changing circumstances and contexts (Sandhu and Zarabi, 2018) to protect their wellbeing (Schimmack and Diener, 2003; Karademas, 2006; Ryan and Deci, 2011; Moreira et al., 2015) . To this end, Knowles (1975) , a pioneer in the field of self-directed learning, defines self-directed learning as a process in which learners independently diagnose their intellectual and emotional learning needs, identify and formulate learning goals, gather resources to support learning, select and implement learning strategies, and evaluate learning outcomes. Capacitating learners to become self-directed learners who are able learners to take ownership of responsiveness to learn (Long, 1989; Garrison, 1997) , requires the development of core critical thinking skills such as analysis, evaluation, making inferences, explanation, interpretation, reflection, as well as self-regulation processes that lie at the core of being able to self-direct one's actions and behavior (Bailey, 2016; Uribe-Enciso et al., 2017; Coberley-Holt and Elufiede, 2019) . Moreover, the development of dispositions, such as perseverance, curiosity, inquisitiveness, empathy, integrity, humility, fairness, open-mindedness, a questioning attitude, and systematic working ways, need to be nurtured, as they are viewed as important characteristics of a self-directed learner (Seligman, 2011; Guglielmino, 2013; Barrett, 2014; Obied and Gad, 2017) .",

            "text": "Flowing from the brief background introduction to selfregulated and self-directed learning, one concludes that selfregulated learning and self-directed learning involve active, independent, and goal-directed learning for which purposeful mental actions, processes, and decisions are required, and comprise an element of student control and ownership (Cosnefroy and Carr\u00e9, 2014) . Some of the important differences between the two concepts as observed by Carr\u00e9 and Cosnefroy (2011) and Cosnefroy and Carr\u00e9 (2014) that are relevant for the article involve the following: in the context of self-directed learning, learning tasks are always defined independently by the learner, thus implying self-regulation ability and selfdetermination. In contrast, self-regulated learning often involves tasks generated by the teacher, signifying that self-regulation could also be controlled externally by a teacher for example. Self-regulated learning can involve learner self-determination but never fully implies self-directed learning. For this reason, self-regulation should be viewed on a continuum from lowself-regulation (external teacher control is evident) to high selfregulation (learner choices and decisions play a determining role during learning). Self-directed learning and self-regulated learning involve the ability to self-regulate decisions about cognition, metacognition, motivation, emotion/affect, and the context/environment in the context of classroom learning, with self-directed learning focusing exclusively on independent learner initiated decisions and self-regulated learning on a combination of teacher controlled decisions and learner initiated decisions.",

Being able to self-direct the cognitive dimension of the learning process implies defining a task, setting goals to achieve, selecting strategies to achieve the goals -which might often involve working with others -as well as managing the actual task performance and making adaptations if necessary. Cognitive engagement contributes to learners becoming immersed, engaged, and involved in achieving learning goals, which could among others, boost performance, meaningful learning, social connectedness, success, self-efficacy, and pleasure; features of academic, psychological, emotional, and social wellbeing. Autonomously managing the context/environment in which learning takes place is likely to ensure the optimal use of resources that could contribute to the elimination of cognitive, motivational, and emotional obstacles to successful learning, thus contributing to elevating academic and personal wellbeing.",

            "text": "To apply a cognitive approach to teaching, teachers must have a better understanding of the processes required to adapt their teaching practices to enhance the cognitive potential (thinking skills and dispositions) of learners that would benefit their ability to become effective at supervised self-regulated learning, which is considered a prerequisite for becoming autonomous and self-directed. The theoretical conceptualization of Cognitive Education hinges on three pillars, namely, teaching FOR, OF, and ABOUT thinking (Anderson, 2010) . Teaching FOR thinking involves the creation of school-wide and classroom conditions that support the development of thinking skills and dispositions that are also important for enabling self-directed academic and personal wellbeing. Teaching OF thinking accentuates the explicit teaching and modeling of thinking skills and dispositions to learners that would encourage involvement in supervised selfregulated learning to become self-directed learners in the future. Educators who focus on the teaching OF thinking guide learners on how to become effective self-regulated thinkers who will be prepared to take on and abolish challenges that threaten their academic and personal wellbeing throughout their lives (Pajares, 2001; Booysen et al., 2017) . A strong focus is placed on \"how\" subject content is taught. Cognitive Education assumes a constructionist (Mezirow, 1997) , transformative (McGonigal, 2005; Herlo, 2017) , and experiential approach (Jensen, 2005) to teaching and learning, where teaching and learning are inquirybased, anchored in real-world problems, and learners build their academic capability, guided by teachers, to become progressively independent, critical, and confident participants who can selfdirect the learning process (Wegerif, 2013; Green and Murris, 2014) . Different strategies that promote inquiry-based learning could be utilized, such as questioning (Green and Murris, 2014) , problem-based learning (Dost\u00e1l, 2015) , didactic play (Bodrova and Leong, 2012) , the use of stories (Van Aswegen, 2015), De Bono's six thinking hats (De Bono, 1992) , cooperative learning (Weidner, 2003) , dialogic education (Alexander and Wolfe, 2008) , argumentation (Van den Berg, 2010) and Thinking Maps (Hyerle and Alper, 2011; Hyerle, 2014) . As part of teaching ABOUT thinking, teachers help learners to become aware of, and apply the metacognitive thinking processes involved in self-regulating behavior, namely planning, monitoring, and evaluating learning, thus emphasizing the role of self-reflection during learning (Anderson, 2010) . By applying self-regulation processes, learners become acquainted with regulating and eliminating the motivational -, affective -, and behavioral processes, as well as conditions in their environment that might obstruct academic success and wellbeing (Moonsamy, 2014) . In a nutshell, Cognitive Education is characterized by instructional processes that enable learners to assume responsibility for regulating their academic and personal wellbeing during learning with the support of the teachers. Learners gradually learn to take complete ownership for modulating emotions, thoughts, behaviors, and the environment to maximize effective outcomes without support (Williams et al., 2008) , consequently to be regarded as self-directed learners.",

Apart from the role of social media to address the health and wellbeing challenges arising from the COVID-19 pandemic (Liu et al., 2021) , the Cognitive Education intervention is an initiative that places the focus on the role of education to promote desirable behaviors directed at elevating wellbeing (Azadi et al., 2021) and contribute toward sustainable efforts that could bolster and strengthen learners' self-directed behavior to affect their wellbeing (Paulson et al., 2021) .",

The heart of the intervention encompassed the modeling of the following teaching strategies to the in-service teacher participants to develop the thinking skills and dispositions to promote self-regulated action, namely, Thinking Maps (Hyerle, 2014) , De Bono's thinking hats (Evans and Carolan, 2014) , Habits of Mind (Costa, 2009; Anderson, 2010) , cooperative learning (Booysen and Grosser, 2014) , the Q-Matrix (Wiederhold and Kagan, 2007) , problem-based learning (Hmelo-Silver, 2004) , and Bloom's revised taxonomy (Kratwohl, 2002) . The application of all the strategies initially involves a teacher-regulated environment to encourage the development of thinking skills and dispositions to employ during learning that could be beneficial for ensuring the planning, monitoring, and evaluation of conditions associated with the cognitive component of self-regulated learning. Gradually, as learners develop more confidence in applying the strategies independently, it is hoped that the teacher-directed learning environment will be replaced with a learner-regulated environment that allows learners to independently apply the acquired thinking skills and dispositions to plan, monitor, and evaluate their learning. Although each of the strategies presents several strengths and weaknesses for enabling self-directed learning, the strengths of each strategy for enabling self-directed academic and personal wellbeing will be singled out.",

Learners learn how to independently select and construct appropriate Thinking Maps during learning, which, according to the authors, encourages academic wellbeing by promoting autonomous and self-directed engagement during learning. Learners who become successful at independently selecting and applying the thinking processes encapsulated in the Thinking Maps could achieve greater success in their academic work which could impact their self-esteem and feelings of self-efficacy, as well as raise the levels of enjoyment experienced during learning, thus contributing to their feelings of emotional wellbeing.",

The six hats strategy makes it possible for learners to gradually through self-questioning, further their immersion and engagement in discovering depth in their thinking about subject content that could advance a better understanding of information that is likely to impact academic achievement favorably and in turn, elevate feelings of academic wellbeing and stimulate positive emotions related to self-efficacy, and pleasure and enjoyment in learning. The Habits of Mind strategy (Costa, 2009; Costa and Kallick, 2009 ) plays an important role in the development of important intellectual dispositions/attitudes and positive emotions whilst engaged in learning, thinking, and decision making. Habits of Mind refers to mindsets or mental and emotional moods that enhance the quality of task completion, decision making, and problem-solving in any context, thus being beneficial toward academic and personal wellbeing. According to Costa and Kallick (2009) , the Habits of Mind can be clustered according to five groups, all of which aim to further selfdirected action namely: (i) resilient that involves being able and willing to persist, work, and communicate with accuracy and precision. Resilient behavior capacitates one to not easily get overwhelmed, weary and pessimistic when faced with personal crises and academic challenges, but without support navigate toward gathering resources to overcome crises and challenges, therefore possibly advancing psychological wellbeing by inspiring feelings of adequacy and personal growth; (ii) resourcefulbeing resourceful involves being creative, flexible, innovative, and open-minded in self-governing the elimination of obstacles that obstruct academic and personal wellbeing that likely will contribute to feelings of self-determination and autonomy as attributes of psychological wellbeing, and self-efficacy as an attribute of emotional wellbeing; (iii) reasoning that comprises the ability and preparedness to engage in metacognitive selfreflective and self-regulated action that is foundational to selfdirect the planning, monitoring, and evaluation of behavior and decision making required to promote academic and personal wellbeing; (iv) reflective that refers to the unsupervised ability to eagerly discover humor, react with wonderment and awe, and to remain open to learning, that could consequently boost energy, curiosity, enthusiasm as attributes of academic wellbeing, and meaningfulness as an attribute of emotional wellbeing; and (v) responsible that includes a keenness to ensure the quality of one's work by avoiding impulsiveness, a desire to be empathetic and understanding, and open to collaboration and taking calculated risks. Academic success might increase from a responsible disposition toward one's work, subsequently advancing academic wellbeing. Social wellbeing could flourish by encouraging collaboration that promotes social inclusion and connectedness. Finally, emotional and psychological wellbeing could thrive when risk-taking leads to goal achievement that bolsters self-efficacy and personal success, respectively.",

The authors maintain that problem-based teaching could therefore contribute to presenting learning opportunities through which the aforementioned skills and dispositions would likely contribute to qualities of academic as well as psychological, social, and emotional wellbeing.

Also, reflective questioning was used to encourage the teachers to think deeper about the information presented to them, and to prompt them to scrutinize their answers to the questions posed to them during the facilitation sessions for clarity, depth, relevance, and completeness. Collaboration stood central to the implementation of the intervention. Teachers were often requested to work in groups or pairs, as teachers had to be sensitized to the importance of the social nature of learning for the development of the thinking skills and dispositions required for self-directed learning. Although the intervention is specifically aimed at enabling self-directed learning among learners in a classroom, the intervention exposed the teachers to a training opportunity that also focused on the development of their ability to self-direct their learning in preparing for the facilitation sessions and in making decisions regarding the application of the information required during the facilitation sessions to their practical assignments.",

The voice recorded data were transcribed verbatim, and the verbatim data were scrutinized to obtain impressions of depth in the data, followed by open-coding segments of the data; thus looking for concepts and ideas in the participants' responses that answered the interview questions. For this purpose, the authors worked deductively as they identified existing codes from the literature review about cognitive education, and self-directed academic and personal wellbeing (Nieuwenhuis, 2016) that were brought into connection with the verbatim data. The authors, however, remained open to discovering unexpected and interesting codes inductively from the data that might reflect new insights and enrich the set of deductively identified codes. The existing codes from the literature that guided the coding process comprised the following aspects, namely evidence of (i) the types of thinking abilities or thinking skills displayed by learners; (ii) the qualities of the teachers' teaching and the classroom environment; (iii) the dispositions, attitudes, and values displayed by the learners; (iv) teachers' attitudes and beliefs about their role during teaching; and (v) the role that learners play during teaching. An unexpected and surprising code that the authors did not anticipate related to the enhanced emotional wellbeing of the teachers, discussed as Theme 4 in the section \"Results. \" After the open coding, axial codes were created by listing all the open codes and grouping similar and recurring open codes with a suitable label. Axial coding made it possible to uncover explicit links between the data. The process was iterative and relied on a constant comparison of the various axial codes. Similar or related axial codes were color-coded, which provided the authors with an indication of possible core emergent themes; patterns in the data that came up repeatedly (Merriam, 2009) . Within each of the themes, sub-themes that shared the same focus as the theme, but emphasized a specific element concerning the theme, were constructed. The themes and sub-themes that emerged from the data are highlighted in the section \"Results\" of the article, and appropriate verbatim extracts from the data are included to illustrate and substantiate the themes (Prior, 2020, p. 548) .",

Subsequently, the attained academic wellbeing could contribute to increased motivation, persistence, self-efficacy, and selfconfidence (Conley, 2014) , as signs of greater personal wellbeing. Unfortunately, the understanding of the teachers did not reflect that Cognitive Education includes the explicit development of dispositions that are central to ensuring academic and personal wellbeing. Nevertheless, the development of dispositions among the learners was identified by the teachers during the application of the newly acquired teaching strategies.",

Learners became more empowered to take charge of their learning, which could have contributed to their displaying a more passionate, enthusiastic, eager, and engaged approach toward their learning, thus reflecting some characteristics of academic wellbeing (Lewis et al., 2011; Wang and Degol, 2014) and likely experiencing some degree of satisfaction and fulfillment whilst engaged in learning. The positive emotions probably lead to greater motivation, persistence, and willingness toward sustained study and task engagement (Dweck et al., 2011; Villavicencio and Bernardo, 2013; R\u00fcppel et al., 2015) , and the building of personal resources such as selfefficacy and optimism (Ouweneel et al., 2011) mentioned by the teachers. In the long run, positive emotions could promote greater study engagement to ensure better academic achievement and overall wellbeing at school (Gr\u00e4bel, 2017) . The detected positive emotions such as enjoyment, eagerness, and enthusiasm concerning learning that were experienced by the learners who were exposed to Cognitive Education, are all important for academic achievement (Richardson et al., 2012; Wang et al., 2015) and emotional wellbeing (Seligman, 2011) . One could therefore conclude, that perhaps Cognitive Education could provide the foundation for encouraging the positive emotions that will enable academic and personal wellbeing.",

The discerned development of critical thinking among the learners in all probability might have inspired the self-assessment and monitoring of work as features of positive engagement referred to by Seligman (2011) . The self-assessment and self-monitoring behavior might also signify some degree of competence toward self-directed leadership and autonomy during learning displayed by the learners as a result of the exposure to the new teaching strategies. The deeper levels of thinking exhibited by the learners during learning without a doubt prepared them for growing engagement during learning. It seems fair to argue, that Cognitive Education enables learners to acquire the skills and dispositions that energize learning and prevent academic burnout (Salmela-Aro and Upadyaya, 2014; Rimpel\u00e4 et al., 2020) that could negatively affect academic wellbeing. On the account of the authors, Cognitive Education could therefore be accepted as an approach to teaching that would enable increased self-directed participation (behavioral engagement) in learning, a positive inclination toward learning (emotional participation), and a willingness to apply stronger mental efforts to learning (cognitive participation) (Wang and Degol, 2014) .",

The raised level of cognitive engagement could be considered as a protective factor to ensure academic wellbeing and success (Wang and Fredricks, 2014) , and life satisfaction (Lewis et al., 2011) . Weariness and being pessimistic about school (Salmela-Aro and Upadyaya, 2014; Rimpel\u00e4 et al., 2020) , helplessness (Heikkil\u00e4 et al., 2010) , and being avoidance-oriented (Saeri et al., 2017; Tuominen et al., 2020) as signs of academic discontent might therefore probably be eliminated when learners are exposed to continued Cognitive Education. The authors believe that improved engagement in learning enabled better understanding and meaning-making of subject content, which brought happiness and enjoyment to the learners. Therefore, enjoyment generated through the cognitive approach to education could be seen as a factor that can strengthen academic and emotional wellbeing. Also, enjoyment and engagement can energize learners to continuously pursue academic success that would enable them to build meaningful futures after school, consequently elevating psychological wellbeing.",

Teachers detected among the learners the emergence of skills to work together with others, learners learning from others, showing respect to, and sharing with others, all of which suggest a reflection of teamwork and kindness (Seligman, 2011) . The development of communication -and social skills that were mentioned by the teachers support the encouragement of positive social attitudes and connectedness toward others, which could be acknowledged as crucial to the social dimension of personal wellbeing (Olsson et al., 2013) . The authors consider social connectedness as important for the provision of emotional support in challenging times. Social support can play a prominent role in providing encouragement and assistance to learners in the face of academic challenges that could negatively impact emotional wellbeing. Interacting and sharing with peers testify to increased social connectedness (Olsson et al., 2013) , which is probably indicative of more positive attitudes toward others and personal behavior that in all probability will not manifest in isolation, sadness, and self-doubt (Saeri et al., 2017) . For Olsson et al. (2013) , social connectedness is viewed as a more important route than academic ability to ensure adult personal wellbeing.",

Experiencing meaning can be associated with the teachers' observations of numerous positive traits, feelings, and behaviors such as, engagement, enjoyment, curiosity, excitement, involvement, interest, eagerness, and alertness among the learners whilst involved in classroom learning, that support the positive aspects of personal emotional wellbeing (Schimmack and Diener, 2003; Seligman, 2011; Fomina et al., 2020) . The authors believe that motivation to learn, finding a sense of purpose and meaning in learning, and mastering what was learned were probably inspired by the cognitive approach to teaching.

            "text": "In the fifth place, it would appear that the teachers' impressions of increased self-confidence, less impulsive working ways, persistence, self-control, self-efficacy, more accurate working ways, and self-respect among learners attest to some degree of accomplishment, the final core element of wellbeing, according to Seligman (2011) . The mentioned traits also focus one's attention on attributes of personal emotional wellbeing that were probably achieved. If a strong sense of self-efficacy prevails, Bandura (2006) asserts that people can reign with resilient power over and master obstacles in the way of their self-development and life circumstances (Bandura, 2006) . Feelings of self-efficacy prompt one to persist (Tompkins, 2013) , and can magnify accomplishment, as well as personal wellbeing (Bandura, 1994) . Suldo et al. (2006) posit that teaching environments need to be modified to support academic and personal wellbeing, intending to transform learners from being dependent and self-regulated (Ryan and Deci, 2011; Fomina et al., 2020) , to self-directed (Kazachikhina, 2019) . The application of Cognitive Education demonstrated that the classroom environment indeed mediates a positive link for enabling self-directed academic and personal wellbeing (Ryan and Deci, 2001; R\u00fcppel et al., 2015; Gr\u00e4bel, 2017; Rimpel\u00e4 et al., 2020) , by shaping positive cognitions and positive emotions for academic and personal wellbeing that contribute to the flourishing of character strengths associated with autonomous learning, namely, self-efficacy, self-confidence, and self-esteem (Seligman et al., 2009; Macaskill and Denovan, 2013) . Over and above, the implementation of a cognitive intervention at the school level supports the reasoning of Paus et al. (2008) and Choi (2018) , that childhood and adolescence are the most decisive stages for cognitive development, learning how to regulate emotions, inspiring motivation and establishing social interactions; thus laying the foundation for enabling academic and personal wellbeing at an early age. Although the intervention probably enabled self-directed academic and personal wellbeing among learners, it was encouraging that the intervention boosted emotional wellbeing among the teachers too, as their competence, self-confidence, self-efficacy, and self-motivation were elevated due to their being empowered with a repertoire of new teaching strategies. These strategies empowered them to create quality inclusive teaching and learning environments that did not focus on a one-sizefits-all approach but were open to developing and transforming attitudes/dispositions as well as the thinking capacity among learners toward self-directed learning. Brockett (2009 ), Heikkil\u00e4 et al. (2010 , Macaskill and Denovan (2013) , and Villavicencio and Bernardo (2013) suggest that helping learners develop personal wellbeing may bolster academic achievement and self-direction, suggesting that academic wellbeing and self-direction depends on personal wellbeing. However, the authors argue that the strong reciprocal relationships between academic and personal wellbeing (as outlined in the article) rather suggest establishing an environment that encourages the simultaneous enabling of both, with self-directed learning as the vehicle to support the enabling. The experience of meaningfulness during school engagement could spark positive emotions and satisfaction that benefit emotional wellbeing. In turn, positive emotions could lead to greater immersion and involvement in schoolwork, being prepared to put in more effort in schoolwork, and experiencing school work as meaningful. Feelings of weariness as part of school burnout could ignite negative emotions as part of emotional wellbeing. On the other hand, negative emotions could manifest as a pessimistic attitude toward school, and contribute to feelings of academic inadequacy that could potentially impact one's psychological wellbeing concerning being successful and vice versa.",

Compared to psychological wellbeing, benefits related to academic wellbeing, and emotional and social wellbeing seemed to have been exploited more. Still, from the data, it is also not clear how dimensions of emotional wellbeing, such as resilience, self-motivation, and self-doubt might have benefitted from the Cognitive Education intervention. The aforementioned could be attributed to the exclusive focus on teaching strategies that placed explicit focus on advancing the thinking skills and dispositions to selfregulate behavior in the cognitive domain of learning. Although increased self-directed cognitive action beneficial to academic and personal wellbeing was evident, adapting the intervention to also include teaching strategies that specifically focus on shaping self-regulated behavior concerning the motivational, emotional/affective, and contextual/environmental domains of learning could deliver more powerful gains for self-directing psychological and emotional wellbeing.",

Prioritizing the wellbeing needs for the South African context would necessitate a more purposeful consideration of a wider repertoire of teaching strategies to include in the intervention that would encourage the development of the skills and dispositions for enabling selfdirected wellbeing across a wider spectrum of wellbeing needs. It would be of interest to establish whether the priority that is given to psychological and social wellbeing needs (Fattahi et al., 2020) ; health and physical wellbeing needs (Pouresmaeil et al., 2019; Azadi et al., 2021) , and spiritual wellbeing needs (Pouresmaeil et al., 2019) , also manifest as prime wellbeing needs in the South African context.",

By adapting and strengthening the theoretical framework of the intervention, the finer dimensions of academic and personal wellbeing could be aligned to applicable teaching strategies that adequately enable academic and personal wellbeing in its entirety. An aspect that requires further inquiry is how and whether experiencing personal wellbeing in an academic context, as discovered in the research, might relate to experiencing personal wellbeing in daily life circumstances. Also, although the research findings pointed to some advances concerning learner performance that refer to deeper thinking, understanding, and achievement, the evidence according to the current research is not yet powerful, and the long term effects of a Cognitive Education intervention on academic performance and achievement need to be established. Azadi et al. (2021) affirm the importance of an acceptable theoretical framework to achieve success with educational intervention programs aimed at enhancing wellbeing behaviors. Consciously embedding the design of the Cognitive Education intervention in three theoretical frameworks seemed meaningful, as beneficial research results in support of enhanced academic and personal wellbeing were offered. Expanding on the theoretical work of Teal et al. (2015) that links research in two fields, namely, self-directed learning and Positive Psychology (wellbeing), the authors aimed to present a theoretical and practical suggestion of how Cognitive Education as a theoretical foundation could bridge self-directed learning and Positive Psychology (wellbeing), thus uniting three fields that mutually reinforce and support each other, and prompt new questions to be posed and answered concerning the relationship between Cognitive Education, Positive Psychology (wellbeing), and self-directed learning. Through the interdisciplinary connection of Positive Psychology (wellbeing), Cognitive Education, and self-directed learning new topics of investigation and practical application are illuminated.",

This research demonstrated that Cognitive Education could be regarded as a form of strengths-based education. Through the application of selected teaching strategies thinking skills and dispositions that encouraged increased self-directed action during learning were developed. The advances learners made in particular concerning the development and application of critical thinking and metacognitive thinking attest to benefits for supporting self-directed action during learning. The growth and development of dispositions such as being increasingly involved in learning, displaying a more open mindset toward the opinions of others, engaging with peers, exhibiting more empathy and respect toward peers, and persisting in more accurate task completion are some of the dispositions that are associated with progressive self-directed action. These thinking skills and dispositions served as protective factors for encouraging positive thoughts and emotions during learning, promoting positive engagement during learning, advancing social connectedness during learning, contributing to experiencing learning as meaningful, accomplishing greater success, and fostering increased self-efficacy that consequently advanced academic and personal wellbeing. The research findings disclosed the importance of Cognitive Education to affect, inspire and lay the groundwork for greater resilient and self-directed action among learners in decision making that could benefit their academic and personal wellbeing. Arguments in favor of teacher support for academic and personal wellbeing are not new, however, this research clarifies how a cognitive approach to teaching capacitates teachers to modify teaching environments that would enable learners to acquire the thinking skills and dispositions necessary to become independent, self-regulated, and eventually self-directed managers of their academic and personal wellbeing.",
