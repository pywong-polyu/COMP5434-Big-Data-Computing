In this study, we investigated antimicrobial-induced temporal changes in diversity, stability, and compositions of gut microbiota in neonatal veal calves, with the objective of identifying microbial markers that predict diarrhea. A total of 220 samples from 63 calves in first 8 weeks of life were used in this study. The results suggest that increase in diversity and stability of gut microbiota over time was a feature of \"healthy\" (non-diarrheic) calves during early life. Therapeutic antimicrobials delayed the temporal development of diversity and taxa-function robustness (a measure of microbial stability). In addition, predicted genes associated with beta lactam and cationic antimicrobial peptide resistance were more abundant in gut microbiota of calves treated with therapeutic antimicrobials. Random forest machine learning algorithm revealed that Trueperella, Streptococcus, Dorea, uncultured Lachnospiraceae, Ruminococcus 2, and Erysipelatoclostridium may be key microbial markers that can differentiate \"healthy\" and \"unhealthy\" (diarrheic) gut microbiota, as they predicted early life diarrhea with an accuracy of 84.3%. Our findings suggest that diarrhea in veal calves may be predicted by the shift in early life gut microbiota, which may provide an opportunity for early intervention (e.g., prebiotics or probiotics) to improve calf health with reduced usage of antimicrobials.",

            "text": "Antimicrobials are widely used for both prevention and treatment of common infectious diseases such as diarrhea in food-producing animals during early life [1] . Young animals are particularly susceptible to infections due to their underdeveloped immune system [2] and lack of immunocompetence [3] . Increasing evidence has revealed the importance of early life gut microbiome due to its role in shaping the host immune system [4] and having a long time impact on gut health in adult life [5] . Perturbations in early life microbiome by antimicrobials have been reported to have long-term negative impacts on host immune function, including immunological defects or increased susceptibility to colonization by pathogens, in mice and human infants [6, 7] . Despite these findings in mice and humans, the knowledge of antimicrobial-induced perturbation in gut microbiota of ruminants is scarce, especially for dairy calves. Although reduced fecal microbial diversity has been reported in calves treated with antimicrobials for respiratory disease [8, 9] , it is not clear whether the reported reduction in microbial diversity is due to antimicrobial treatment or the disease itself. On the other hand, it is largely unknown how therapeutic antimicrobials affect the temporal development of microbial stability or the ability of given microbial populations to withstand direct perturbations [10] in neonatal ruminants.",

Some antimicrobial use is necessary to effectively treat diseases in food-producing animals, however, the prevention and control of diseases before an outbreak is more cost-effective [12] . Thus, predicting disease onset based on the gut microbiota composition [13] could provide an opportunity for early intervention with an aim to reduce the use of antimicrobials. Recent findings based on human gut or oral microbiota have enabled the tentative prediction of type-2-diabetes [14] , adiposity [15] , and tooth decay [16] . Therefore, we speculated that early life gut microbiota in ruminants can predict gut health status as well as onset of early life diarrhea, one of the major health threats to ruminants.",

Upon arrival, all animals were transferred to the experimental farm and individually examined to ensure they were all free of disease, injury, and dehydration. The health condition of each calf was evaluated daily over the 56-day experiment period. The animal experiment was conducted following the instructions of the Canadian Council of Animal Care and the experiment protocol was approved by the Livestock Care Committee of the University of Alberta (AUP00001595). The general appearance, fecal score, rectal temperature, umbilical score, and respiratory score were recorded as reported by Villot et al. [17] . Briefly, a total of 84 calves were enrolled with 42 fed milk replacer (CON) and the other 42 fed milk replacer with Saccharomyces cerevisiae boulardii (SCB). The milk replacer contained 63% of skim milk powder with 260 g/kg crude protein, 160 g/kg crude fat, and 19.2 MJ/kg metabolizable energy on a dry matter basis (Grober Animal Nutrition, Cambridge, ON, Canada). Calves with diarrhea (defined as when the fecal score was \u22652, meaning a fecal sample is either loose but stays on top of mat, or watery and sifts through the mat, for at least 2 days [18] ) received 2 l of oral electrolytes (Calf Lyte II, Vetoquinol, Lavaltrie, QC, Canada) once daily over the entire experimental period. If no improvement was observed after electrolyte treatment or if severe diarrhea (dehydration and attitude scores > 0 and fecal score \u2265 2) was detected, calves were treated with trimethoprim sulfa (Trimidox, 0.7 ml/10 kg BW, Vetoquinol) for 3 consecutive days. If a calf was still diarrheic after treatment, it was treated with Excenel (0.2 ml/10 kg BW, Zoetis, Kirkland, QC, Canada) for another 3 consecutive days. Fecal samples (~20 g) were collected directly from the rectum by rectal palpation at 7 (on arrival), then again at 14, 21, 42, and 56 days of age, and were stored at \u221220\u00b0C immediately after collection.",

Therefore, only 21 calves exhibiting diarrhea in SCB group were enrolled in the current study, as SCB is a nonpathogenic biotherapeutic agent [19] and it should not contribute to the incidence of diarrhea with the dosage supplemented.

Therefore, the microbiota collected from H2H calves at 7, 14, and 21 days of age were defined as \"healthy\" (n = 39 from CON), while those collected from R2H and S2H calves prior to the onset of diarrhea in both CON (n = 33) and SCB groups (n = 26) were defined as \"unhealthy\" (Table 1) . To establish the model for predicting diarrhea, random forest algorithms (\"randomForest\" package in R) were used to identify \"healthy\" and \"unhealthy\" microbiota based on the relative abundance of selected bacterial genera. The accuracy of selected bacterial genera was then assessed by area under the receiver-operating characteristic (AUC) (\"roc.curve\" package) in R. To further minimize the potential over-fitting in the model, a threefold crossvalidation approach (\"trainControl\" package in R) was applied [30] . The threefold cross-validation method splits 98 samples into three disjoint (nonoverlapping) subsets with similar number of samples (e.g. 33, 33, and 32). Then, two subsets (containing 66/65 samples) were used to train the model and the other subset (containing 32/33 samples, totally different from two subsets for training) was used to test the results. The threefold cross-validation was completed until accuracy was determined for each permutation and combination of samples in the subsets, and then an overall accuracy was estimated. The AUC of the optimized model was calculated using \"roc.curve\" package in R.",

            "text": "Increase in diversity and stability at an early age has been characterized as a feature of establishment of healthy gut microbiota in humans [35, 36] . In the current study, we observed an increase in Shannon index of gut microbiota from 7 to 56 days of age in both H2H and R2H calves. Such findings are similar to the changes in fecal microbiota in healthy dairy calves during first 8 weeks of age [37, 38] . However, the detected changes in gut microbial diversity in healthy calves of previous studies were largely confounded with diets, as those calves were fed different diets during their experimental trials [37, 38] . To overcome such limitations, the calves in the current study were fed only milk replacer (same amount under the same age), and therefore we speculate that host (age and growth) was the main factor driving the development of microbial diversity in early life of these veal calves. Although the temporal changes in microbial diversity of gut microbiota in R2H calves was similar to those in H2H calves, higher CV of Shannon index in R2H than H2H calves suggests that perturbations due to diarrhea in R2H calves may cause fluctuation to the development in microbial diversity. The use of therapeutic antimicrobials, on the other hand, \"delayed\" the temporal development of microbial diversity of gut microbiota from 7 to 21 days of age in S2H calves, which may be explained by the loss of microorganisms sensitive to antimicrobials as previously reported in human gut microbiota [39] . In addition, the decrease in Bray-Curtis distance between two successive samples reached significant at 42 and 21 days of age, respectively, in H2H and R2H groups, but at 56 days of age in S2H group, suggesting that it may take much longer time for microbiota to become less variable due to the use of antimicrobials. Those findings suggest that therapeutic antimicrobial treatment had more severe negative impact on the temporal development of microbial diversity and stability than diarrhea during the first 21 days of life in veal calves. The insignificant Shannon indices among R2H, S2H, and H2H calves at 56 days of age may be explained by the relatively long interval after disease/the use of therapeutic antimicrobials, during which the microbial diversity recovered as observed in humans [40, 41] . However, it should be noted that perturbation such as disease and antimicrobial treatment may also lead to an alternative stable but \"dysbiosis\" microbial community [42] . How those perturbations and altered microbial community affect the health and productivity of calves in their later life deserves further investigation.",

High prevalence of Blautia has been reported in colon and fecal microbiota of healthy neonatal swine [43] and human infants [44, 45] . On the contrary, the reduction in the abundance of this genus was reported in fecal samples of dogs with diarrhea [46] and enteropathy [47] . Blautia utilizes polysaccharides that other gut microorganisms cannot degrade [48] and produces butyrate, one of the major SCFA that maintains gut health via regulation of the immune system [49] and/or maintenance of the intestinal epithelial barrier [50] . On the other hand, many species of Escherichia-Shigella, e.g. E. coli [51] and S. flexneri [52] , are widely accepted as the major pathogens to cause bovine diarrhea. Although there was no difference in the relative abundance of any bacterial genus at any age between H2H and S2H calves, the detected higher relative abundance of predicted genes involved in antimicrobial resistance in S2H compared with H2H calves suggests that the changes of microbiota in response to the antimicrobials may occur not necessarily at compositional level but at functional level [53] . It has been reported that short-term antimicrobial treatment drove the gut microbiota to a more resilient state to future antimicrobial treatment in adult human due to the persistence of these increased antimicrobial-resistant genes for years [40] . In this regard, higher relative abundance of predicted microbial genes associated with antimicrobial resistance (bla regulator protein blaR1, penicillin-binding protein 1 and 3, aureolysin) at 56 days of age in H2S calves may potentially increase the risk of failure of future antimicrobial treatment.",

            "text": "Changes in the abundance of members could result in a minor or major alteration to a community's functional profile, depending on the stability of microbiota [54] . Stability relates to the concept that stable equilibrium status exists for a microbial community, in which disturbances and temporal dynamics of individual members cause changes, but the community as a whole has the ability to restore such changes to the original status [55] . A community with higher stability is more resilient to external perturbations so its functional profile is less likely to change. Based on the attenuation and buffering values of three group of calves, higher attenuation implies that smaller functional shifts are expected in a community given similar levels of perturbation, while higher buffering indicates that larger perturbations are needed before a significant functional shift could be observed [28] . No temporal change in buffering was observed in either group, indicating that similar level of perturbations is required to cause a substantial functional shift regardless of sampling time, disease, or antimicrobial treatment. However, our results suggest that in H2H calves, the temporal development of stability was featured by a significant increase in attenuation value from 7 to 21 days of age, a pattern that was not observed in R2H or S2H calves. Higher attenuation in H2H calves may ensure the maintenance of functional capacities of the fecal microbial community in the face of ecological dysbiosis during early life. In comparison, the increase in attenuation value in R2H calves may be \"delayed,\" as it was not different between 21 and 7 days of age. The potential delay in the increase of attenuation over time in R2H calves may reflect gradual recovery of temporal stability after disease (diarrhea). Although we expected similar delay of the increase in attenuation in S2H as in R2H calves, the increase in attenuation was not observed in S2H calves. As it was reported that antimicrobial treatment may disrupt microbial community function [25] , our results suggest that antimicrobial treatment may have a more negative impact on the temporal development of stability of gut microbiota compared with disease (such as diarrhea). Future studies using shotgun metagenomics may be able to determine the factors driving microbial resilience during early life, which is crucial for designing strategies to minimize the negative impact of antimicrobial treatment on microbial stability of veal calves. Despite those findings, it should be noted that further increase in sample size may be needed to validate those differences, as early life gut microbiota is featured by high between-individual variabilities indicated by the high SEM of relative abundance of bacterial genera (Table S1) .",

However, studies are still limited, and to our knowledge no study has been conducted in the prediction of disease onset based on gut microbiota in young ruminants. Teng et al. [16] exploited microbial indicators of dental caries (Prevotella spp.) after excluding the age-discriminatory taxa, yielding a predicting accuracy of 81%. More recently, it is reported that disease initiation can be diagnosed using gut microbial indicators with 95% accuracy in shrimp [62] . In this study, we initially tried to establish the model based on 72 samples from CON calves (39 healthy and 33 unhealthy) only. However, the prediction accuracy for \"unhealthy\" microbiota was <70% (data not shown). After including the 26 samples from SCB calves in the model, the prediction accuracy of \"unhealthy\" microbiota reached 84.3%, suggesting that early life microbiota has the potential to be employed for disease (such as diarrhea) prediction in young ruminants. It should be noted that in spite of the prediction model established by us and others, it is still challenging to predict human and animal diseases using microbial markers in practice. One of the reasons may be due to the fact that the \"relative abundance\" of microbial markers was used in those model establishing studies, which is difficult to compare among studies and make reproducible analyses due to the constraints of compositional data [63] . Recently, a novel method, differential abundance analysis, may address the issue of misinterpretation of compositional data and provide insight into the absolute change in microbiota between two conditions, as the ranks of relative differentials are identical to the ranks of absolute differentials [33] . By applying this method, it is suggested that Trueperella was positively associated with \"unhealthy\" microbiota, while the other five bacterial genera were positively associated with \"healthy\" microbiota. This further highlighted that the difference in the relative abundance of those six markers correctly reflects their absolute difference between \"healthy\" and \"unhealthy\" microbiota. One of the limitations of our study is that for most of diarrheic calves, only one sampling time (7 days of age) was available prior to incidence of diarrhea, which may not be sufficient to reflect the changes in gut microbiota during disease processes. Therefore, studies are needed to verify if and how those microbial markers play a role in the process of diarrhea in newborn calves with more sampling time points and different populations to determine their prediction specificity of diarrhea in young ruminants. It is also important to be noted that it may not be easy to choose a \"optimal\" or even \"suitable\" external cohort for validation of the random forest model for the current study. Due to the heterogeneity of DNA extraction, library preparation, sequencing, and bioinformatic techniques, metaanalyses among studies [64] , the standardized microbial analysis pipeline should be developed in order to test the robustness of microbial classifiers developed based on machine learning algorithm such as the random forest model among studies.",
