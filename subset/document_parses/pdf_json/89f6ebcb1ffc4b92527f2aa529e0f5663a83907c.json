Other medications commonly implicated include antitubercular drugs, lowdose aspirin, cytotoxic chemotherapy, calcineurin inhibitors, and nicotinic acid. Various mechanisms have been suggested, including increased uric acid reabsorption and/or decreased uric acid excretion in the renal tubuli, massive disruption of tumor cells (tumor lysis syndrome), and increased uric acid production. 1, 2 Drug-induced hyperuricemia is usually fully reversible upon discontinuation of the offending agent but may result in kidney injury and other manifestations of gout if not recognized and appropriately managed. 1, 3 Hyperuricemia has been described as an adverse effect of ribavirin most commonly reported with use of the drug in combination with pegylated interferon-\u03b12a/b for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C. The precise culprit-whether it be ribavirin, interferon, a drug-disease interaction, or a combination thereof-and the mechanism of this adverse effect are unclear.

            "text": "Drug-induced hyperuricemia and its potential clinical sequelae (eg, gout, kidney injury) collectively constitute an adverse drug effect that is often overlooked in clinical practice. While in most patients the magnitude of drug-induced hyperuricemia is mild and of limited clinical consequence, there is great variability in treatment response and some patients develop significant uric acid increases associated with acute or chronic uric acid nephropathy, nephrolithiasis, and gout. Mechanisms of drug-induced hyperuricemia include uric acid overproduction and/or a reduction in renal uric acid excretion. 1, 2 Use of thiazides and loop diuretics is one of the most common causes of secondary hyperuricemia. They decrease renal uric acid clearance by reducing tubular secretion and increasing reabsorption. 1,2 Diuretic-induced hyperuricemia appears to be dose dependent, manifests within a few days of treatment initiation, and persists during continued administration. 10 The median increase of uric acid is small (about 1.0 mg/dL with use of thiazide diuretics), 11 but increases may range from 6% to 35% of baseline values. 3, 12 Diuretic-induced hyperuricemia is reversible after discontinuation of the offending agent. 1, 3, 12 A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t All reported cases of ribavirin-associated hyperuricemia occurred in patients with hepatitis C receiving combination therapy with other antiviral agents, most commonly pegylated interferon-\u03b12 (with or without telaprevir) and sofobuvir. [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] 13, 14 Significant hyperuricemia associated with use of ribavirin in combination with pegylated interferon-\u03b12 has been described in a number of case reports, case series, and cohort studies (summarized in Table 1 ). In a case series reported by Yamashita et al, 5 among 50 patients use of pegylated interferon-\u03b12b plus ribavirin was associated with a mild but statistically significant rise in the mean (SD) uric acid concentration, from 5.4 (1.2) mg/dL at baseline to 5.8 (1.6) mg/dL during combination therapy (P = 0.0023 for paired comparison), and the concentrations remained within the normal range in 85% of the patients. Interestingly, urinary uric acid excretion was increased after initiation of combination therapy with ribavirin and pegylated interferon-\u03b12b, suggesting increased uric acid synthesis rather than reduced renal excretion as the mechanism of hyperuricemia. Moreover, the rise in uric acid was not associated with markers of hemolysis (a rise in lactate dehydrogenase [LDH] or a decline in hemoglobin), suggesting that other mechanisms contributed to ribavirin-induced hyperuricemia.",

The early onset and the magnitude of the uric acid elevation were different from those observed with use of diuretics 1, 12 or in most patients treated with ribavirin and interferon combination therapy, but a case of early-onset hyperuricemia of a similar magnitude was previously described in association with ribavirin and pegylated interferon combination therapy. 8 The probability of a causal relationship between ribavirin therapy and hyperuricemia in our patient is high. Using the validated adverse drug reaction probability scale of Naranjo A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t et al, 15 we determined that causality between ribavirin use and development of severe hyperuricemia can be considered probable (a cumulative score of 7) on account of previous reports of this reaction (+1), timing (+2), improvement after drug discontinuation (+1), the lack of an alternative explanation (+2), and the objective assessment of the adverse event (+1). The patient had no history of hyperuricemia, his electronic medical record revealed normal uric acid levels in recent laboratory examinations, and he had no chronic disease predisposing to hyperuricemia, such as obesity, impaired glucose tolerance and/or insulin resistance, alcohol abuse, or renal disease. The rapid and extreme rise in uric acid levels and rapid reversal after the administration of rasburicase and discontinuation of ribavirin strengthen a causal association. There was no reasonable alternative explanation for the extreme rise in uric acid. Cyclosporine use is associated with hyperuricemia in 30% to 85% of renal transplant recipients, probably occurring through an increase in proximal tubule uric acid reabsorption and a reduction in glomerular filtration rate secondary to afferent arteriolar vasoconstriction. 1 However, cylosporine-induced hyperuricemia was unlikely in the case reported here, as the patient had normal uric acid levels for months while on a long-term cyclosporine regimen and cyclosporine trough levels were in the low-normal range (84 ng/mL) during a hospitalization about 1 year previously.",

One of the proposed mechanisms is the induction of dose-dependent hemolytic anemia. 6, 17 Ribavirin is transported into erythrocytes by the nucleoside transporter and is converted into ribavirin mono-, di-, and triphosphate derivatives. These ribavirin phosphates accumulate intracellularly because erythrocytes lack the phosphatase needed to hydrolyze them, resulting in cellular toxicity and subsequent hemolysis. 18 In our patient, there was a mild decline in hemoglobin (about 1 g/dL) on the day of the marked increase in uric acid, 2 days after initiation of ribavirin, but no concomitant increase in indirect bilirubin, LDH, or aspartate transaminase. We therefore believe that hemolysis cannot fully explain the patient's hyperuricemia. Moreoever, the occurrence of ribavirin-associated hyperuricemia in the absence of significant hemolysis has been described in the literature, suggesting that additional mechanisms may exist.",

GTP is required for viral replication. Inhibition of the IMPDH pathway by ribavirin may result in the increased transformation of IMP to hypoxanthine and xanthine, precursors of uric acid. Thus, ribavirin could directly increase serum uric acid synthesis through the hypoxanthine/xanthine pathway. 18, 19 Interestingly, hyperuricemia is also a common adverse effect of mizoribine, [20] [21] [22] an immunosuppressive drug and competitive inhibitor of IMPDH 23 with structural similarity to ribavirin. In fact, severe hyperuricemia (a rise in the uric acid concentration of 10.7-21.2 mg/dL) has been reported after mizoribine monotherapy. 20 A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t",
