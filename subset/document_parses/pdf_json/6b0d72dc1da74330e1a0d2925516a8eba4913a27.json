To explore patients' needs and preferences regarding AD care, a qualitative study consisting of three focus groups with a total of 20 adult AD patients was conducted. All sessions were transcribed verbatim and inductively analyzed using several phases of coding to create an overview of patients' needs and preferences. AD patients emphasized the need for a patient-tailored approach in all identified aspects of AD care. With regard to consultations, patients stressed the need for a personal approach and increased recognition of the disease impact, which should mainly be determined by patients. With regard to the organization of AD care, the need for psychosocial and medical supportive care as well as quick access to health-care providers during disease flares was emphasized. Within the decision-making process, patients indicated that the provided information, the role of the patient and physician, whether or not treatment goals should be set, and decisive factors for indication and feasibility of novel therapies should be patient dependent. AD care should be patient tailored with increased attention for the psychosocial burden, as well as better access to health care during disease flares. To provide patient-tailored care, the personal situation, needs, and preferences of the patient should be taken into account in the therapeutic decision-making process, with respect for the autonomy of the patient.",

Subsequently, the first two transcripts were openly coded (i.e., inductively and line by line) [20] by one researcher (LW) and independently checked by another (ML). This resulted in a list of unstructured codes. More abstract and structured concepts of relevance were obtained through axial coding [20] . Using this structured coding scheme, the transcript of the third focus group was coded (LW) and independently checked (SE). No new concepts emerged during coding of the third focus group and data saturation was reached. The identified concepts and their subcategories were discussed during several multidisciplinary (psychologist, dermatologist and PhD student) research team meetings. This resulted in an overview of core needs and preferences within three central aspects of AD care (see Fig. 1 ). Table 1 and Online Resource 2 provide sample characteristics and demographics.",

Patients emphasized the importance of physicians being able to make patient-dependent exceptions on applied guidelines, which are based on relatively homogeneous populations. These exemptions are particularly needed when the disease highly interferes with patients' daily life. Previous studies have shown that therapeutic decisions should indeed be patient centered, fair, and cost-effective in the ideal situation [41] . However, this remains a practical challenge, partly because of the lack of insight into cost-effectiveness of the recently introduced therapies in daily practice [42] . A shift toward more patient-centered indication criteria incorporating the disease impact in daily life in addition to current criteria concerning therapeutic history would be highly appreciated by patients. This would facilitate in making \"fair\" choices, in particular for expensive therapies [8, 41] . Agencies such as the FDA and the NHS also promote patient-centered care, with improved patient access to more affordable drugs [43] [44] [45] . In addition to patient-centered care (i.e., care that is respectful of, and responsive to, individual patient's preferences, needs, and values) [46] , personalized medicine (i.e., tailoring care based on patients' genetic information or other biomarkers) [47] is also considered important to achieve individualized care [48] . Although their sources are different and it remains unclear whether and how these two could be combined on a practical level, personalized medicine might as well contribute to individual flexibility and variability in treatment decisions, and moving away from one-size-fits-all solutions [47] .",
