The outbreak of this virus has resulted in an unprecedented crisis in the health systems of many countries and a serious challenge to the international community. Policymakers in various countries have adopted different strategies to prevent and treat this disease, depending on the local prevalence of the virus, healthcare system resources, economic and political factors, and people's perception of the situation (Rossman et al., 2020) . Iran reported the first confirmed cases of infection in February, 2020 in Qom (Tuite et al., 2020) . Other cities soon reported cases of COVID-19, resulting in the closure of schools and universities in many provinces and the cancellation of numerous cultural, sports, and religious gatherings and conferences. The first case of COVID-19 in Ardabil province was reported on March 28, 2019. Health recommendations were initiated to prevent further infection (Science, 2020) , and in early June, a slightly downward trend of COVID-19 was reported in Ardabil province (Agency, 2020) .",

            "text": "Previous research conducted on outbreaks of infectious diseases, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), avian influenza (AV) and MERS Syndrome (MERS-CoV), has shown that such outbreaks influence health care providers' interest in their jobs (Wong et al., 2010) and increases their turnover intention (Jung et al., 2020) . Turnover intention is a person's willingness to leave the job for which he is currently employed. The desire to leave a job is synonymous with anticipated turnover, which means that a person is likely to leave a job position. The intention of nurses to leave the job leads to an increase in the cost of employment and training for relevant hospitals and is a waste of nursing training resources (Hariri et al., 2012) . Investigating the factors influencing a nurse's turnover intention can help hospital managers take preventive measures and address potential problems in clinical nursing work that may cause a nurse to relocate (Chen et al., 2018) to attend to current concerns about nursing shortages. The turnover intention of nurses is an important issue. There is evidence that the low retention of nurses in healthcare practices is related to heavy workload, burnout and job dissatisfaction (Cai & Zhou, 2009) . It is an issue that has affected many healthcare institutions for years. The mean turnover intention score varies from one country to another. In the Asian countries of Indonesia and South Korea (Lee, 2019) , it has been reported at 15% and 25%, respectively, among Western countries such as the United States (Solutions & Inc, 2019) , it is reported to be 18%, and in Iran (Sokhanvar et al., 2018) , the mean turnover intention score of nurses is 32.7%. The loss of experienced nurses has a negative impact on the provision and continuity of patient care services and may result in more adverse events, lost nursing care and patient mortality (Griffiths et al., 2019) . These conditions are more evident during outbreaks of viral diseases; turnover intention was reported more during outbreaks of SARS and COVID-19 (De los Santos & Labrague, 2020; Jung et al., 2020) . The results of recent studies have suggested a significant relationship between turnover intention and PTSD in nurses involved in patient care during the outbreak of MERS (Jung et al., 2020) . Since nursing staff are exposed daily to stressful events, including violence, patient deaths, emergencies and critically ill patients, they are more likely to suffer post-traumatic stress symptoms (Lavoie et al., 2011) . PTSD during a disease outbreak is estimated to affect up to 8% of the total population (Ebrahimpour et al., 2017) , but during the SARS outbreak, 57% of nurses showed symptoms of PTSD (Jung et al., 2020) , and during the COVID-19 outbreak, the overall mean of PTSD was 1.78 (range of scores was 1 to 3; Nowicki et al., 2020) . Symptoms usually last for more than a month and affect important aspects of one's life, such as the quality of one's professional life and patient care (Saraji & Dargahi, 2006) . Like other known disorders in the area of mental Job stress is one of the factors that threaten nurses' general health, reduce their performance, and provide the conditions for turnover by increasing their job burnout (PEIMAN et al., 2013) .",

The second theory states that social support acts as a moderator against the effects of high stress on wellbeing and related outcomes. Likewise, social support reduces the negative consequences of stress such as health disorders, anxiety, depression, burnout and turnover intention. This model states that social support protects employees against the pathological consequences of stressful experiences (Brouwers et al., 2001; Cohen & Wills, 1985; V\u00e4\u00e4n\u00e4nen et al., 2003) . Different sources of social support can moderate the effects of stress on health in different ways (V\u00e4\u00e4n\u00e4nen et al., 2003) . In fact, having social support, especially the support of co-workers, is one way to deal with job stressors (Brouwers et al., 2001) .",

These results are in line with those of the study conducted by Barzideh et al. Job stress is a result of high job demand and low decision latitude on job conditions and job insecurity. Job demand includes both physical and psychological demands (Barzideh et al., 2013) . Job characteristics as a source of stress can play a major role in people's stress levels. High independence and low complexity at work are associated with lower anxiety and complaints, and conversely, low independence and high complexity at work are associated with higher anxiety and complaints job characteristics as a source of pleasure (high control and low complexity)",

The results of the V\u00e4\u00e4n\u00e4nen study showed that a high-quality relationship with supervisor support may reduce the impact of job demand (e.g. overtime, emotional and physical demands) on job stress, because appreciation and support from supervisors put demands into perspective. Supervisor support may also help an employee cope with job demands, facilitate performance and act as a protector against adverse conditions. Administrative support reflects the appreciation and support of the organization, which may help employees cope with job demand and illness (V\u00e4\u00e4n\u00e4nen et al., 2003) . Thus, the positive relationship between job demand and turnover intention and the negative relationship between job control and turnover intention seem to be logical. The mean score of turnover intention in nurses revealed a significant negative correlation with social support. In other words, increasing co-worker and supervisor support decreases turnover intention in nurses. This result is in line with the results of similar studies conducted in this area (Alipour et al., 2018; Barzideh et al., 2013; Jung et al., 2020) .",

Nurses with high levels of work stress are at a higher risk of turnover intention (DeTienne et al., 2012) . The results of a study conducted by Nissly et al. indicated that people with higher job stress were more likely to quit their jobs, while people with more social support were less likely to think about quitting their jobs. The results also showed that turnover intention had a significant and positive relationship with the level of organizational stress and conflict between work and family among participants. Compared to the power of organizational stress, the impact of work-family conflict was small. It was also found that social support predicts turnover intention (Nissly et al., 2005) . Outcomes of human resource management for staffs with organizational support (supervisor support), desirable job conditions and development of their job goals are effective ways to reduce stressors and ultimately reduce turnover intention. The results of Tetteh et al. showed that job stress is a significant mediating variable that affects employee turnover intention. Employees who experience high levels of work-related stress are more likely to seek alternative jobs. Conversely, a high level of perceived organizational support leads to a reduction in stress and related illnesses and an increase in employee retention (Tetteh et al., 2020) . Organizations that provide more support to employee well-being are more likely to reduce stress and ultimately increase the employees' intention to stay in the organization. Organizations that can understand the reasons and factors influencing employees' turnover intentions will be able to apply effective policies and practices to retain human resources before employees leave the organization.",
