These calculations are based on matrix elements of boosted hadrons coupled to non-local operators and can be related to the standard, light-cone distribution functions via an appropriate factorization formalism. There is significant progress in several directions, including calculations of flavor-singlet parton distribution functions (PDFs), first calculations of generalized parton distributions (GPDs), as well as the implementation of some of the approaches for the transverse-momentumdependent PDFs (TMD PDFs). This new direction of lattice calculations is particularly interesting for phenomenological fits on experimental data sets, as the lattice results can help improve the constraints on the distribution functions.",

Such a mapping of the hadron structure is achieved via a set of quantities, that is, the parton distribution functions (PDFs) [2] , the generalized parton distributions (GPDs) [3] [4] [5] , and the transverse-momentum-dependent distributions (TMD PDFs) [6, 7] . These distributions are number densities and have a probabilistic interpretation within the parton model. However, they are not directly measurable in experiments. The a e-mail: marthac@temple.edu (corresponding author) mechanism that enables access to distribution functions, and therefore to the structure of hadrons, is the asymptotic freedom of QCD. By virtue of asymptotic freedom, the crosssection of high-energy processes can be factorized into a hard part and a soft part. For example, the cross-sections for inclusive unpolarized Deep Inelastic Scattering (DIS) can be written as",

            "text": "where i represents all types of partons, that is, quarks, antiquarks, and gluons. x is the Bjorken scaling variable, and Q 2 represents the scale of the hard interaction. H DIS is the hard part, which is process-dependent and calculable in perturbative QCD. f i is the non-perturbative part of the crosssection, characterizing the structure of hadrons. In the case of the unpolarized DIS, the relevant distribution function is the spin-averaged (or unpolarized) PDF for the ith type of partons. Typically, both functions H DIS and f i are given in the MS scheme. Unlike H , the distribution functions are universal. Also, the dependence of the distribution functions on the factorization scale can be effectively eliminated using the evolution equations, resulting in process-independent functions. Furthermore, the dependence on the renormalization scale does not pose difficulties, as the data sets can be evolved to the same scale using perturbation theory. Therefore, data sets from different processes can be analyzed together within the framework of a global analysis. Factorization expressions similar to Eq. (1) exist for other high-energy processes, such as polarized DIS and Drell-Yan. Their corresponding H function is known up to next-to-leading order (NLO) or next-tonext-to-leading order (NNLO), depending on the process. The PDFs, GPDs, and TMD PDFs are light-cone correlation functions and cannot be accessed from the Euclidean formulation of lattice QCD. Partial information is obtained through the Mellin moments of distribution functions, and, in principle, one can reconstruct the parton distributions using an operator product expansion (OPE). Practically, a proper and exact reconstruction is an impossible task due to the computational challenges to calculate reliably high moments: the signal-to-noise rapidly decreases, and an unavoidable powerlaw mixing occurs beyond the third non-trivial moment (see, e.g., Refs. [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] ).",

This approach created an intense enthusiasm in both the phenomenological and lattice communities, which led to other proposals, such as the current-current correlators approach [22] [23] [24] , the pseudo-PDFs [25] , and a method based on OPE [26] .",

            "text": "A thorough investigation of systematic uncertainties in the unpolarized, helicity, and transversity PDFs is presented in Ref. [59] . The focus is on selected sources of systematic effects, as only one ensemble is used. The analysis is done using an N f = 2 twisted-mass fermions ensemble with physical pion mass and spatial extent of 4.5 fm (48 3 \u00d7 96). Using four values of the source-sink separation, T sink = 0.75-1.13 fm, excited-states effects are addressed with single-state fits, two-state fits, and the summation method. This analysis concludes that lattice data at T sink below 1 fm are insufficient to suppress excited-states, particularly as P 3 increases. Another effect that requires attention for matrix elements of non-local operators is finite-volume effects [60] . Direct study of volume effects is not possible with one ensemble, but one can examine whether the renormalization functions, Z , exhibit volume effects if obtained using multiple ensembles. In the work of Ref. [59] , the estimates of Z are obtained using ensembles with different volume, that is, 2.25 fm, 4.5 fm, and 6 fm. It is found that volume effects are small and do not affect the final estimates of the PDFs. However, a proper study of volume effects on the matrix elements should be done, ideally at the physical point. Two other sources of uncertainties are presented: the reconstruction of the x-dependence via a FT and the matching procedure. For the former, the standard discretized FT and the \"derivative method\" [61] are tested. While both methods suffer from the ill-defined inverse problem, the derivative method leads to uncontrolled uncertainties in the small-x region (see discussion in Sect. 2.1.3). Regarding the truncation of the FT with respect to z, an optimal value of z max requires that both the real and imaginary parts of the matrix elements are zero. In practice, this is not always observed, and the behavior of the matrix element in the large-z is operator-dependent. The final choices for z max in Ref. [59] are 0.94 fm for the unpolarized and 1.13 fm for the helicity and transversity. Different prescriptions for the matching are employed, with the quasi-PDFs defined in the MS, RI, MMS and ratio scheme. Tension is observed between some of the methods in the small-and large-x regions, as expected. The final PDFs using P 3 = 1.38 GeV are shown in Fig. 1 . Phenomenological estimates are also shown for qualitative comparison. Focusing on the positive x-region, the lattice unpolarized PDF lies above the global fits, while there is agreement in the helicity PDF for x 0.4-0.5. The mild rise in the large x-region, could be due to the limitations of the FT, and advanced reconstruction methods must be investigated. Finally, the transversity PDF for x 0.4-0.5 is in agreement with the SIDIS results with or without the tensor charge constraint. The rise in the large-x region is observed on all PDFs. The analysis of Ref. [59] provide insight on selected sources of systematic uncertainties using simulations at the physical point. The bands in Fig. 1 include only statistical uncertainties, as the analysis confirms that the effects are either negligible, e.g., in Z , or require further investigations, such as, advanced reconstruction techniques.",

The momentum boost used is 1.3 for all three ensembles and 2.6 GeV for the smallest-and largestvolume ensemble. Excited-states effects are quantified using four T sink values between 0.72 and 1.08 fm, and the final results are presented using two-state fit.

The lattice spacing is 0.042 fm and L = 2.7 fm. While the physical volume of the ensemble is small, it is expected to have reduced discretization effects. As discussed above, there are indications that volume effects are not a major source of systematic uncertainties, at least for simulations at heavier pion mass. The 2pt-functions are calculated at seven values of P 3 between 0 and 2.77 GeV to understand the effect of excited-states contamination, using up to three-state fits. As P 3 increases, the fits become less reliable, and priors are needed to increase stability. For the 3pt-point functions, only P 3 = 1.84, 2.31 GeV are used and three values of T sink = 0.67 \u2212 0.84 fm. A 3-, 4-, 5parameter two-state fit is applied, with the difference in the energy between the ground-state and first-excited state determined independently from the 2pt-functions fits. An agreement between the three fits is found; however, the matrix elements from the 5-parameter fit are a factor of two more noisy.",

The common feature with quasi-PDFs is the use of the same matrix elements M of boosted hadrons coupled to non-local operators (Eq. 4). In the pseudo-ITDs approach, the analysis uses the Lorentz invariants, z 2 and \u03bd \u2261 \u2212p \u00b7 z, instead of z and P 3 . The variable \u03bd is historically called Ioffe time [87, 88] . 4 In Euclidean space and based on the conventions we use here, \u03bd = z P 3 . M(\u03bd, z 2 ) are called Ioffe-time pseudo-distributions (pseudo-ITDs). One of the main differences between the quasi-and pseudodistributions formulations is that the former is the Fourier transform of M(P 3 , z) in z, while the latter is the Fourier transform of M(\u03bd, z 2 ) in \u03bd. Similar to quasi-distributions, the pseudo-distributions approach relies on the factorization of pseudo-ITDs obtained on the lattice to extract the lightcone ITDs, using a matching kernel calculable in perturbative QCD. The necessary matching is performed at the level of ITDs [56, 83, 84, 89] in coordinate space, while in the quasi-PDFs approach is done in the momentum space.",

M(\u03bd, z 2 ) also reduces the higher-twist contamination, as discussed in Ref. [90] . The success of the approach is based on calculating M(\u03bd, z 2 ) for a wide range of \u03bd, including small-\u03bd values, by varying either P 3 , or z, or both. Therefore, physical information is included in matrix elements from low values of P 3 . This is in contrast with the quasi-PDFs, where matrix elements at different P 3 are not analyzed together. The M(\u03bd, z 2 ) are matched to light-cone ITDs, Q(\u03bd, \u03bc 2 ) using a matching procedure, and at the same time are converted to the MS and evolved to a common scale, \u03bc = 1/z [56, 83, 84, 89] .

Therefore, the full and sea-quark 5 distributions can be extracted by combining the two equations. Whether this is possible in practice, depends on the statistical precision of the lattice data. As we will see below, most of the calculations focus on the valence distributions, namely, the real part of Q(\u03bd, \u03bc 2 ). The pseudo-ITDs approach has been studied for the unpolarized PDF for the pion and the nucleon in a series of publications, with the more recent ones presented in Refs. [78, 91, 92] . Also, Ref. [93] discusses the challenges of reconstructing the light-cone distributions from lattice data due to the ill-defined inverse problem and the need for advanced reconstruction methods. This is relevant for all methods discussed in this article. Here, we focus on the results from Ref. [92] on the nucleon valence unpolarized PDF, which uses three ensembles with pion mass 172, 278, and 358 MeV to perform an extrapolation to the physical point. Using the 172 MeV ensemble, they calculate the first two moments of PDFs and pseudo-ITDs. The results for x from pseudo-ITDs and PDFs are in agreement with phenomenological estimates [63, 64, 94] , while there is some tension for x 2 using the PDFs lattice estimates for z 2 > 4a 2 . A better agreement is observed for the pseudo-ITDs estimates and NNPDF31 [63] . It was checked that higher-twist effects are negligible in accordance with Ref. [90] , as there is no dependence of the moments on z 2 within the reported uncertainties. The pion mass dependence between the 172 and 278 MeV is found to be within uncertainties. The same holds for the 358 MeV ensemble, which is, however, much noisier. Therefore, nonnegligible pion mass dependence between data at the physical point and pion mass above 300-350 MeV is not excluded. Such a dependence was found in Ref. [42] . The final results use a linear extrapolation applied to the lightest two ensembles and is compared to the phenomenological fits in Fig. 5 . The lattice data are in agreement with the determinations of Refs. [63, 64, 94] up to x \u223c 0.25. Beyond that, the lattice results overestimate the global fits, which is consistent with the tension observed in x 2 . This is because the numerical values of high moments receive important contributions from the large-x region. An in-depth investigation of systematic uncertainties is necessary to address the tension, such as discretization effects and volume effects, which is a multi-year effort and requires multiple ensembles.",

For the first time, the full PDF, q(x) = q v (x)+q(x), and sea-quark PDF, q s (x) =q(x), are accessed through the calculation of both the valence, q v , and the combination q v +2q. The latter is obtained from Eq. (10) , which is more difficult to extract, as one requires control over statistical uncertainties. One ensemble at the physical point is used, with N f = 2 twisted-mass fermions and lattice extent 4.5 fm (48 3 \u00d7 96). Six values of P 3 are used, P 3 = 0 \u2212 1.38 GeV, combined with all possible values of z, so that \u03bd max \u223c 8. Based on the scale dependence of the reduced pseudo-ITD, it is concluded that z values up to 8a = 0.75 fm are safe to be used, as the effect is within the reported uncertainties. An extensive investigation is performed on identifying the optimal maximum value of \u03bd used to extract the final PDFs. It is found that \u03bd max = 5.2 (z max = 0.75 fm) is optimal. One factor to consider is the number of data entering the reconstruction of PDFs given in Eq. (8) . One seeks reliable and statistically meaningful results. Three approaches are explored and compared, namely, a discretized FT, the Backus-Gilbert (BG) [96] , and the fitting reconstruction (FR) of Ref. [91] . The latter is implemented using an ansatz with the proper small-and large-x behavior, inspired by the global fits of experimental data sets. One of the main differences between the discretized FT and the other methods is that the former underestimates the uncertainties. The uncertainties do not reflect the lack of data in certain regions of \u03bd. On the contrary, the BG and FR have larger uncertainties, reflecting the challenges of the reconstruction and the amount of information in the lattice data. It is found that the fitting reconstruction performs better than the other approaches and is, thus, used in the final analysis, as shown in Fig. 6 .",

The quasi-PDFs data have a mild oscillation between x = 0.7 and x = 1 and are slightly above the results of the other two calculations. This level of agreement suggests that systematic uncertainties related to the inverse problem, to P 3 and the maximum value of z P 3 are within the uncertainties. One can also address the concern on the renormalization prescription. As mentioned above, the scheme in pseudo-ITDs is gauge invariant and avoids the need for an additional renormalization function in an intermediate RI -type scheme prior the matching to the light-cone PDFs. Furthermore, there are indications that the RI-type scheme is meaningful in the small-z region, z/a = 3 \u2212 4 [97] . For the values of the lattice spacing used in current calculations, it corresponds to the region z = 0.2-0.4 fm. Therefore, it is expected that there are systematic uncertainties related to the renormalization of quasi-PDFs. While this is valid, the agreement observed between the results using different lattice formulations and other approaches suggests that such effects are probably within the reported uncertainties.",

The latter can be used to extract PDFs and eventually analyzed together, in an analogous way as the experimental data [22] [23] [24] . In such global fits of lattice data, systematic effects from different results may have less influence in the combined PDFs. However, this is an ideal scenario, and it is not clear how systematic uncertainties from each lattice data will affect the combined fits in practice. Good candidates to construct the set of LCSs share similar features: (a) are calculable in lattice QCD; (b) are renormalizable; (c) have the same and factorizable logarithmic collinear divergences as PDFs.

The calculation is performed on N f = 2 + 1 clover fermion ensembles with three values of the pion mass 278, 358, 413 MeV, with two volumes for the heavy pion mass (3 fm and 4 fm). The vector and axial currents are used as J 1 and J 2 , respectively. The momentum boost employed is between 0.41 and 1.65 GeV. Several values of the current separation length are used, up to z = 6a = 0.76 fm. As discussed in Ref. [98] , the signal decays significantly with increasing P 3 , particularly for m \u03c0 = 268 MeV. For example, for current separation of 3a, the errors are 3 times larger for P 3 = 1.65 GeV as compared to P 3 = 0.41 GeV. Consequently, the data for source-sink separation greater than 12a = 1.5 fm and P 3 \u2265 1.25 GeV are not reliable due to the uncontrolled sta- v (x)-distribution using two parameterizations (cyan and red bands), shown together with the E615 data from Ref. [74] (blue band) and Ref. [99] using E615 re-scaled data [75] . The results are given in the MS scheme at a scale of \u221a 27 GeV. Source: Ref. [98] . Article published under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license tistical uncertainties. This conclusion is compatible with the findings of other calculations (see, e.g., Sect. 5). Only the lattice data with a signal-to-noise ratio greater than 1 enter the excited-states analysis. The data from all ensembles are simultaneously analyzed to obtain the functional form of the ITDs. A chiral, continuum, volume, and higher-twist extrapolation are employed using the z-expansion, which is frequently used to fit the momentum transferred square, Q 2 , dependence of form factors. We note that three pion masses, two lattice spacings, and two volumes enter the fit, making the extraction of some of the fit parameters susceptible to systematic uncertainties. Only z < 0.56 fm < 1/ QCD is used in the final analysis, for which the short-distance factorization seems to hold, and the higher-twist contributions are suppressed. However, a negligible dependence on z is found within the reported uncertainties, which is in agreement with the findings of Refs. [92, 95] . This corroborates the suggestion that the short-distance factorization (SDF) can be applied beyond 0.3-0.4 fm for the current data, as the corresponding systematic effects are within the uncertainties. Next-to-leading (NLO) order factorization is applied to the extrapolated current-current correlators, and are then parameterized to q \u03c0 v (x). Two sets of the parameters are identified as good estimates. The analysis shows that larger values of the Ioffe time are needed to constrain the fit parameters better. Given that the values of z must be in a perturbative region, one should increase P 3 to achieve higher values of the Ioffe time. As already discussed, increasing P 3 while statistical uncertainties are controlled is a major challenge of the lattice calculations.",

The pion PDF is extracted using the quasi-PDF formulation, and the xdependence reconstruction is performed using the derivative method [61] , according to which one neglects the surface term in the integration by parts of the FT. This method does not solve the inverse problem, as discussed in Ref. [101] . It also introduces further uncertainties (see Sect. 3). The results presented in Ref. [72] also employ the quasi-PDFs method and are discussed in Sect. 2.1.1. Instead of a standard FT, two approaches are tested that rely on fits applied to the lattice data in the coordinate space. This is closer to the approach employed in Refs. [78, 79, 98] . The valence pion distribution is shown in Fig. 9 . Note that the various calculations are evolved to different scales: \u03bc = 2 GeV [78] , \u03bc = 3.2 GeV [72] , and \u03bc = 4 GeV [79, 100] . However, scale dependence is expected to be small within these values. An agreement is observed between the results of Refs. [72, 78, 79] up to x \u223c 0.5, and find the distribution to reach its maximum at around x = 0.3. Note that Ref. [78] combines two N f = 2 + 1 ensembles with clover fermions reproducing a pion mass of 415 MeV and different volumes (3 fm and 4 fm). Reference [79] uses the same ensemble with 4 fm. Even though the two calculations are completely independent and do not share any matrix elements, the distribution extracted is in full agreement. The results of Ref. [72] have a smaller slope after the peak and approaches x = 1 differently. As mentioned above, a fit on the lattice data is applied to handle the inverse problem, and the x \u2192 1 limit is one of the constraints. The results found in Ref. [100] disagree with the other calculations, as they have a maximum of around x = 0.5 and is higher than the other calculations beyond x = 0.5. The use of the derivative method may contribute to this disagreement.",

The methods discussed above rely on factorization (in momentum or coordinate space) and require large P 3 or large z P 3 while ensuring that the values used are within the perturbative region. The hadronic tensor method does not require large momentum, as it is frame-independent. It is also free of renormalization. The feasibility of the approach in terms of technical methods can be found in Ref. [102] . The method relies on analyzing ratios of suitable four-point and two-point functions, which is computationally very challenging, as one has to suppress the gauge noise and isolate the ground state at the same time. Another difficulty is the reconstruction of the Minkowski hadronic tensor, a process that also suffers from the inverse problem. In-depth investigations are needed to identify which methods are promising.",

            "text": "One of the recent highlights is the calculation of disconnected contributions of matrix elements of non-local operators, which have been analyzed within the quasi-PDFs framework. This is an important direction, as some of the PDFs are not well-constrained from global analyses. For example, most of the high-energy processes are not sensitive to the strangeness. Therefore, it is difficult to disentangle the strange-quark PDF from the down-quark PDF. This results in large ambiguities in its extraction, and, for example, global analysis of DIS + SIDIS data sets gives different sign for the strange-quark helicity PDF, s , for different fragmentation functions [108, 109] . This poses limitations on the reliable extraction of the W -boson mass and the determination of the CKM matrix element V cs [110, 111] . Thus, the lattice calculations are quite timely, and while preliminary, demonstrate their potential. To date, there are only two calculations at higher-than-the-physical pion mass, which we briefly summarize here [112, 113] . Both calculations apply the non-singlet renormalization functions calculated nonperturbatively, and the mixing with the gluon PDFs has been neglected. It should be noted that this mixing arises at the matching level and not at renormalization because there is no additional non-local ultraviolet divergence in the quasi-PDF [52, 114, 115] . The effects of neglecting both the singlet renormalization and the mixing are expected to be within the calculations' uncertainties.",

The nucleon is boosted with momentum up to P 3 = 2.18 GeV. Two values of the valence pion mass are used: 310 and 690 MeV, on which a 2-parameter chiral extrapolation is performed, making it less reliable. Also, unlike the 2-parameter fit applied in Ref. [92] , here the lightest ensemble is above 300 MeV, possibly not capturing the pion mass dependence near the physical point properly. Furthermore, similar statistical accuracy is required for all data for an unbiased fit. However, the data obtained for the 690 MeV ensemble are a factor of 2-3 more accurate than the 310 MeV data, at P 3 = 1.74 GeV. The lattice data are presented in coordinate space as a function of z P 3 , and an inverse matching and inverse FT is applied on the global fits from NNPDF31 [63] and CT18 [71] .",

The imaginary part is nonzero, and in agreement with CT18 up to z P 3 = 12\u03c0/24 \u223c 1.6, and with the less-accurate NNPDF31 up to z P 3 = 18\u03c0/24 \u223c 2.4.

As can be seen, the lattice data for P 3 = 1.75 and 2.18 GeV are very noisy, and thus not very useful. Such rapid decrease of the signal with increase of the momentum boost has been discussed by various groups (see, e.g., Refs. [59, 77, 98] ). In general, the lattice data have flat behavior, which is not supported by the global fits, demonstrating a tension of a factor of 2 for the large values of z P 3 . It is assumed that this is due to not taking into account the other flavors in the matching [112] . Results on the charm unpolarized PDF can be found in Ref. [112] .",

This has already been discuss in several papers for the quasi-PDFs [51] [52] [53] [54] 115] , pseudo-ITDs [117] , and current-current correlators [24] methods. Ab initio calculations of gluon PDFs is a new direction and largely unexplored. However, it is an essential one because gluonic contributions are sizeable, for example in the proton spin [118] [119] [120] [121] [122] . Global analysis find that gluon PDFs are dominant in the production of Higgs boson and heavy quarkonium [62] [63] [64] 71, [123] [124] [125] [126] . In fact, the recent analyses constrained better the small-x region, using recent data on the tt-quark data at the LHC [127] [128] [129] and Tevatron [130] , as well as the HERA run I+II data [131] . The gluon PDFs play an essential role in the structure of hadrons. For example, the gluon PDFs dominate over the quark PDFs in the small-x region. Besides their essential role in the hadron structure, calculations of gluon PDFs serve another important purpose: they are necessary to eliminate the mixing with the quark singlet PDFs [132] . Disentanglement of the gluon and quark singlet PDFs will eliminate one of the sources of systematic uncertainties in lattice calculations. For the case of Mellin moments of PDFs, the mixing appears in the renormalization. However, as discussed above, the non-local operators are multiplicatively renormalizable. 6 The mixing between the flavor-singlet quark and gluon PDFs should be eliminated at the factorization level.",

The nucleon is boosted with P 3 = 0.46, 0.92 GeV. One of the operators employed exhibits mixing with other gluonic operators under renormalization, in addition to the mixing with the quark singlet PDFs. Also, the calculation lacks renormalization, and instead, the matrix elements are normalized. Such a normalization changes the quantity under study, and the matching kernel of quasi-PDFs is not applicable. Therefore, only matrix elements are extracted, demonstrating the challenges of the calculation: for m \u03c0 = 678 MeV at P 3 = 0.92 GeV the noise exceeds 40% of the signal beyond z = 3a, while for m \u03c0 = 340 MeV the noise is 40% already at z = 0 and the signal is lost at z = 4a.",

From a technical standpoint, the advantage of pseudo-ITDs is the cancellation of the renormalization functions in the reduced pseudo-ITD. As discussed in Sect. 2.1, the RI-type renormalization procedure does not pose a difficulty for quark PDFs, which can be seen by the agreement of unpolarized PDFs obtained from the same ensemble using the quasi-and pseudo-ITDs methods [59, 95] (Fig. 7) . However, the calculation of the renormalization function for non-local gluon operators cannot be reliably extracted with the methods used for x g [121, 122] . The mixing between the quark-singlet and gluon PDFs appears at the matching procedure for both quasi-and pseudo-ITDs. In Ref.

The final results are shown in Fig. 14 , for the two ensembles. The same 2-parameter extrapolation of Ref. [112] is also applied here. As discussed in Sect. 2.2, the uncertainties of such procedure are uncontrolled, as only two ensembles are available, with much different statistical uncertainties.

Also, they are not smaller in magnitude than the twist-2 PDFs, and thus, are important to be considered. Most of the work on twist-3 PDFs is theoretical (see e.g., Refs. [136] [137] [138] [139] [140] ), while the experimental studies are limited. It is very challenging to probe them experimentally and isolate them from the leading-twist contributions. Also, their theoretical analysis is more evolved and goes beyond the simple partonic model. A recent re-analysis of the JLab Hall A data on the absolute DVCS beam helicity cross-section differences [141, 142] addressed twist-3, but it is inconclusive on their contribution.",

Therefore, a violation of the WW approximation is still possible at the level of up to 40% for x 0.4, which is similar to the one found using experimental data [145] . The comparison is qualitative, as simulations at the physical pion mass and investigation of systematic uncertainties are essential. It should also be noted that there is a mixing present in the renormalization of the operator for g T and involves three other operators (see, e.g., Ref. [151] ). One of these operators vanishes by the equation of motion, one is gauge variant, leaving only two operators with non-vanishing physical matrix elements: a quark-quark operator of the form \u03c8 \u03b3 j \u03b3 5 \u03c8 and a quark-gluon-quark operator \u03c8 F \u03b1\u03b2 \u03b3 j \u03c8. In the quasi-distributions approach, such mixing should be dealt with at the matching level, as discussed above for the gluon and singlet quark PDFs. However, twist-3 is a completely unexplored area for the quasi-PDFs approach. While a lot of work is needed in the direction of twist-3 PDFs, the work of Refs.

It has been discussed extensively that the truncation of the matching formula to NLO is one of the major sources of systematic uncertainties. Therefore, this is an important development.

            "text": "As discussed in previous subsections, the matching (factorization) between the light-cone distributions and the lattice component (quasi-PDF, pseudo-PDF, etc) is calculable in perturbative QCD. Thus, there are limitations in the zrange for this process to be well-defined. This also concerns the renormalization. For example, in an RI-type scheme used in the quasi-PDFs method, there could be non-perturbative effects in the large-z region through logarithms, such as log(z 2 \u03bc 2 ). Also, in the pseudo-ITDs ratio, there could be higher-twist effects in large z. However, both the RI-type and ratio schemes are suitable to remove all divergence for small and intermediate values of z. This is the main motivation of Ref. [97] , proposing a hybrid renormalization, which treats the short-distance and long-distance renormalization separately. This consists of using an RI-type, or ratio scheme up to some z max , and a mass-subtraction scheme for the z beyond z max . At z max , the renormalization functions from the two schemes should be the same based on continuity arguments. It is estimated that an upper limit for z max is around 0.4 fm. This constraint for z max may be beyond the current precision level of state-of-the-art calculations. For example, the agreement observed in Figs. 7 and 9 between lattice data from different lattice actions and renormalization schemes, does not indicate large effect from treating renormalization differently. The validity of extrapolating the lattice data based on the asymptotic long-range Regge-type behavior [156] is also presented. This type of fits is also used in the pseudo-ITDs and current-current correlators method.",

The work is based on one-loop calculations of quasi-PDFs and pseudo-PDFs in a renormalizable scalar theory. The calculation addresses the erroneous claims [158, 159] that quasi-PDFs cannot be related to light-cone PDFs because the moments of the former exhibit powerdivergent mixing. It should be noted that the claims have been refuted in more than one publications [84, 101, 160] . For instance, one of the counter-arguments is that, while all moments except for the zeroth do not converge, the light-cone PDFs are extracted from the non-local quasi-distributions avoiding the power divergence problem [160] . The non-local operators under study contain logarithmic divergences and power-law divergence due to the Wilson line. Both are renormalizable by adopting a non-perturbative RI-type prescription. Also, the required matching kernel is responsible for extracting light-cone PDFs with finite moments. A numerical example was given in Ref. [101] calculating the two lowest moments of pseudo-PDFs and found agreement with the results of a direct calculation of moments using one-and two-covariant derivative local operators. Finally, the use of a Taylor expansion in z in Refs. [158, 159] , is only justifiable when all derivatives with respect to z 2 exist at z = 0 [84] , which is not the case for the non-local operators discussed here. The work of Ref. [157] generalizes Collins' work [161] to off-light-cone matrix elements for leading twist and found that quasi-PDFs and pseudo-PDFs are equivalent. These, as well as their light-cone counterparts, are renormalizable. It is also demonstrated that factorization exists at small z, large P 3 , and small flow times. Yet again, the claims of Refs. [158, 159] have been proven invalid. Light-cone PDFs can indeed be accessed properly via the methods discussed in this review, and other methodologies. Recently, there has been an interest from the phenomenological community to incorporate lattice data in the global analyses, in the same fashion as the experimental data sets. The primary motivation is to explore whether the PDFs can be constrained more successfully in regions where the experimental data are either sparse, imprecise, or non-existing. A general framework to extract PDFs from the lattice data treating them on the same footing as experimental data is presented in Ref. [162] . The methodology is implemented for the unpolarized PDFs within the NNPDF fitting framework using the results of Refs. [42, 59] . Two non-singlet flavor combinations are considered, that is",

The procedure is based on finding a \u03c7 2 -function, which is minimized in order to extract V 3 and T 3 . Quantifying statistical and systematic uncertainties is important in this process. Six plausible scenarios are considered to assess systematic uncertainties that are not known, focus on the two realistic ones, labeled S2 and S5. Scenario S2 gives estimates for the uncertainties that are a percentage of the value of the matrix element at each z. Scenario S5 assumes that the uncertainties are zindependent. In particular, scenario S2 attributes 20%, 5%, 10%, 20% for cut-off effects, finite-volume effects, excitedstates contamination truncation of perturbative expansion, respectively. Scenario S5 adds (0.2, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2) for all z values, for the systematic effects mentioned above. The analysis of lattice data including these systematic effects is shown in Fig. 16 , and are compared to the phenomenological fits NNPDF31. It is observed that the more conservative scenario S2 leads to larger uncertainties, and is marginally compatible with the global analysis estimate at most regions of x. This analysis emphasizes the importance of properly quantifying systematic uncertainties in lattice estimates. After the submission of this review, the work of NNPDF was extended to include pseudo-PDFs data [163] .",

            "text": "Ref. [164] presents a combined Monte Carlo based QCD global analysis within the JAM framework for both the unpolarized and helicity PDFs. The lattice data of Refs. [42, 59] are treated under the same conditions as the experimental data sets from unpolarized and polarized DIS and Drell-Yan (note this is not the same as the JAM17 results [67] ). The analysis uses the Monte Carlo Bayesian inference sampling methodology, parametrizing the PDFs at the input scale \u03bc, and solving the evolution equations in Mellin space to bring all the observables at the same scale. In a nutshell, the analysis shows a relatively weak constraint from the lattice data on the phenomenological unpolarized PDFs. This behavior is in agreement with the findings of Ref. [162] . In contrast, the lattice data on the helicity PDFs provide significant constraints to the combined estimates, as can be seen in Fig. 17 . It is found that the combined estimates of the quark PDFs have reduced uncertainties by a factor of 3 in the small-and largex regions and a factor of 5 in the intermediate-x regions. The anti-quark isovector helicity PDF exhibits an equally large improvement. It is also interesting that the combined fit (\"exp+lat\") is compatible with the discretized FT (\"DFT\") of Fig. 17 The isovector helicity PDF. The JAM17 [67] results are shown with red band, while the blue band shows the combined fits using both lattice and experimental data. The yellow band shows the data from Refs. [42, 59] using the standard discretized FT. The results are given in the MS scheme at a scale of 2 GeV. Source: [164] . Reprinted based on the arXiv distribution license Refs. [42, 59] . It should be noted that the implementation of the lattice data is done at the level of the renormalized matrix elements in coordinate space. Therefore, the challenges of the inverse problem do not appear directly in this analysis, as the discretized lattice data are fitted within the JAM framework. However, the effectiveness of such fits is driven by the number and quality of the lattice data. As mentioned previously, properly quantifying both statistical and systematic uncertainties is crucial.",

The case of the helicity PDFs is more promising, as the independent analysis of Refs. [42, 59] shows a very good agreement with the global fits for a wide range of x. The lattice data compare favorably with the experimental data sets and demonstrate a great constraining power, as shown in Fig. 17 . The work of Refs. [162, 164] opens up new possibilities for synergy between lattice QCD and global QCD fits. It is expected that, soon, combined analysis of multiple factorizable lattice matrix elements from various approaches will be available, an idea already discussed in Refs. [22, 24] .

They depend on two additional kinematic variables in addition to x, that is, the light-cone component of the longitudinal momentum transfer (skewness), \u03be , and the momentum transfer squared t = 2 . Therefore, t contains information on the transverse part of the longitudinal momentum transfer ( \u22a5 ). Consequently, the GPDs are multi-dimensional quantities, and mapping their other two-dimensional functional surface (t, \u03be) allows one to get information on the two-dimensional structure of hadrons in terms of these kinematic variables.",

The calculation is performed using an N f = 2 + 1 + 1 mixed-action ensemble of HISQ/clover fermions with pion mass of 310 MeV and volume 24 3 \u00d764. Only zero skewness is considered in the calculation, and two values of the momentum transfer, that is \u2212t \u223c 0.40, 0.92 GeV 2 . Since there is only one GPD for the pion, one avoids the complications of disentangling GPDs, and the need for more than one independent matrix elements to achieve the isolation. As a consequence, the calculation of the pion GPDs is computationally less expensive than the nucleon ones. The derivative method is employed, according to which one neglects the surface term in the integration by parts of the FT. This process is controlled only if the renormalized matrix elements decay to zero. Another concern about this method is that the surface term contains a factor of 1/x, which makes the extraction of the PDF for small values of x less reliable. In Ref.

The ensemble has volume 32 3 \u00d7 64 and pion mass 260 MeV. Both zero and nonzero skewness (\u03be = \u00b11/3) have been studied, for P 3 up to 1.67 GeV, and \u2212t = 0.69, 1.39 GeV 2 . As these are discretized on the lattice, specific combinations of the above values of P 3 , \u03be, t have been obtained. Note that the skewness defined in the lattice calculation (quasi-skewness) is defined as \u03be = \u2212 Q 3 2P 3 and differs to the light-cone \u03be in power corrections. As mentioned above, extracting nucleon GPDs is computationally very costly. In addition, one requires a sophisticated analysis to properly disentangle the GPDs, as each matrix elements contributes, in general, to more than one GPDs. 10 For example, the off-forward proton matrix element of the vector current decomposes into 10 An exception is the helicity case for \u03be = 0, which contributes only to H (x, \u03be, t), as the kinematic factor of E(x, \u03be, t) vanishes. where Q \u2261 P f \u2212 P i , and \u2261\u016b N (P f , s ) u N (P i , s) with u N the proton spinors. Therefore, a minimum of two parity projectors are needed, leading to two independent matrix elements, in order to disentangle F H and F E . Another critical aspect of the calculation of GPDs is the need for implementation of the Breit (symmetric) frame. In this setup, both the momentum of the initial and final states, P i , P f carry half of the momentum transfer, that is P i = P 3\u1e91 \u2212 Q/2 and P f = P 3\u1e91 + Q/2. This has major implications in the computational cost, as separate calculations are needed for every value of t, because both the source and sink momenta change. We emphasize that there is a fundamental difference between the calculation of Mellin moments of GPDs (form factors and generalized form factors) and the light-cone GPDs. The former are frame independent, and one can extract them in a more convenient frame, that is, fix the sink momentum and attribute t to the source (P f = P 3\u1e91 , P i = P 3\u1e91 \u2212Q). However, the light-cone GPDs are frame dependent, and their standard definition is in the symmetric frame. The connection between different frames is not a simple kinematical one, and therefore, the lattice calculations must be performed in the frame where GPDs are defined. Introducing momentum transfer in the matrix element, coupled to the momentum boost of the proton states, increases significantly the statistical noise. Another complication of t = 0 is related to the momentum smearing method, which is necessary to suppress the statistical uncertainties. As pointed out in Ref. [45] , the exponent of the momentum smearing phase must be parallel to the proton momentum to ensure overlap with the ground state. Therefore, all ingredients of the optimized ratio between 3pt-and 2pt-correlation functions (see, e.g., Eq. (S4) of the supplementary document of Ref. [170] ) requires a separate momentum smearing. H (x, \u03be, t) and H (x, \u03be, t) at P 3 = 1.25 GeV, for which both zero and nonzero skewness are available. Each is compared to the corresponding PDF, f 1 (x) and g 1 (x), respectively. As can be seen, there is a qualitative difference between the GPDs at zero and nonzero skewness. Let us remind the Reader that this mean zero and nonzero momentum transfer in the direction of the boost. In the latter case, the x-range separates into two kinematic regions, the ERBL (|x| < \u03be), and the DGLAP region (|x| > \u03be), which have different physical interpretation [174] . From the practical standpoint, the matching for \u03be = 0 becomes more complicated than the one for \u03be = 0, with the latter being the same as for the PDFs [175] . The PDFs are more dominant, as the probability of finding quarks with t = 0 decreases with increase of t. For the unpolarized case, we can compare the lattice data in the DGLAP region with the power-counting analysis of Ref. [176] at the x \u2192 1 limit. One of the predictions of this analysis is that H (x, \u03be = 0, t) approaches f 1 (x), which is confirmed by the lattice data. It also predicts that at x \u2192 1 the t-dependence vanishes, which is also observed by the lattice data. For results on the E-GPD and E-GPD, as well as results on the highest momentum, see Ref. [170] .",

The former describes collinear radiation near the hadron and is defined via matrix elements of non-local operators containing a staple-shaped Wilson line. The latter encodes the soft-gluon effects between the partons. The soft function contains little physical information on incoming hadrons but has practical importance: it cancels the rapidity renormalization scale in the beam function.

More details on the first explorations of TMDs from lattice QCD [182] [183] [184] [185] [186] [187] [188] can be found in Ref. [189] . The most recent studies that are discussed here can also be found in Refs. [21, 189] .",

The hadron is boosted with P 3 = 1.29, 1.94, 2.58 GeV and for transverse parton momentum q T in the range of 250 MeV and 2 GeV.

The extracted Collins-Soper kernel is shown in Fig. 21 , together with results from perturbation theory. An agreement is observed only around b T \u223c 0.2\u22120.3 fm. This indicates non-negligible systematic effects in the lattice data, such as power corrections in the small-b T region. The inverse problem's challenges also arise in these calculations, as the Fourier transforms over b T is required. A way to perform the Fourier transform with limited data is to apply fits on the lattice data, as performed in Ref. [200] . However, an extensive study of the systematic uncertainties is necessary to control unwanted effects.",

The calculation is performed using one N f = 2 + 1 CLS ensemble of clover fermions with pion mass 333 MeV in the sea sector and 547 MeV in the valence sector. The momentum boost is up to 2.1 GeV. The final results for the two ensembles are shown in Fig. 22 and are compared with perturbative results, as well as the results from Ref. [200] . We note that the comparison is qualitative, as the latter calculation is quenched and at a very heavy pion mass. This has the benefits of small statistical uncertainties. An agreement is observed between the different lattice results within the errors. The results of Ref. [203] are compatible with the 3-loop perturbative results up to b T \u223c 0.4 fm.",

In particular, we have demonstrated that PDFs calculations have reached an advanced level, with dedicated studies of various sources of systematic uncertainties. Given the progress, precision calculations with controlled uncertainties may be available in the next few years. Gluon PDFs and flavor-singlet quark PDFs are actively being pursued with encouraging results. This direction progressed more slowly than the non-singlet PDFs, as the calculation of disconnected contributions of non-local operators and boosted hadrons are computationally very challenging. The natural extension of the methods to access x-dependent distribution functions is studies of GPDs. Interestingly, only exploratory studies are available, providing the x-dependence of GPDs for selected values of the momentum transfer at zero skewness or limited values of nonzero skewness. This is because the introduction of momentum transfer comes with several complications, most of the computational. The above makes the computation of GPDs much more challenging than the form factors due to the former's frame-dependence. A serious effort is invested in TMD PDFs studies, with most of the work being on theoretical developments. The lattice calculations are still very preliminary, and some of them at very heavy pion mass. A lot more numerical explorations are expected to follow.",

            "text": "As concluded from the main text, the various methods to access x-dependent distribution functions are based on different theoretical formulations and are susceptible to different systematic uncertainties. Regardless, all methods pursue the same physical quantities, even though the factorization procedure is realized differently. Some methods rely directly on large hadron momentum, P 3 , and others on large Ioffe time, z P 3 . Regardless of the classification of the factorization (LaMET, or short-distance), the calculations of matrix elements with boosted hadrons and non-local operators are computationally intensive. It is apparent that there are limitations to the value of P 3 due to the computational cost and the value of a. For coordinate space factorization, there are also limitations on z, which has to be small and within the perturbative region. Since there is a need for large P 3 , or large z P 3 , it is undoubtedly desirable to explore the lattice calculations' current capabilities. Often, there is the misconception that large momentum can be achieved with controlled uncertainties. Instead of making assumptions based on phenomenological models or otherwise, we take a close look at the current calculations to address whether it is feasible to reach high momentum without compromising the reliability of the results. Such a question becomes more pressing for simulations near or at the physical point. Table 1 presents some of the parameters of recent calculations presented in this article, either for the pion or the nucleon. The main focus is on the noise-to-signal ratio, n s , at the maximum value of the matrix elements. For the real part of the matrix elements, the peak is at z = 0, while for the imaginary part is at some intermediate value of z depending on the quantity under study. As most calculations include multiple values of P 3 , we present n s at the highest P 3 , which will provide some indication of the challenges to increase P 3 for non-local operators. It should be emphasized that the noise-to-signal percentages should not be directly compared between methods, as the focus of each approach is different. For example, the pseudo-PDF method and current-current correlators method utilize all values of P 3 , while for the quasi-PDFs analysis, one uses the data at the highest possible momentum. Therefore, the control of statistical uncertainties in the former methods can and is achieved at low momenta. For example, suppose one would analyze the data of Ref. [92] within the quasi-PDFs method. In that case, the maximum momentum, which leads to reliable renormalized results for a wide range of z values, is P 3 \u223c 1.3 GeV for the 172 MeV ensemble. However, the results at P 3 = 2.1 GeV are accurate enough for small values of z within the pseudo-ITDs renormalization scheme. As can be seen, the picture is consistent from all calculations: P 3 close or beyond 2 GeV cannot be reached reliably. This is particularly true for ensembles with a pion mass near or at the physical point.",

[41] for non-local operators. Since then, it has been integrated into all calculations. This direction has been instrumental in allowing access to higher values of P 3 . A recent exploration of the momentumsmearing within the distillation framework can be found in Ref. [206] . We will soon enter the exascale computing era, which promises more computing power. The combination of software and hardware developments will certainly benefit calculations of non-local operators, leading to precision calculations with controlled uncertainties.",
