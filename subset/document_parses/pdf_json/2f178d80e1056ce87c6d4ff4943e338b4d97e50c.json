An example of this is the growing number of \"gender and politics\" scholars and the increased attention paid to gender perspectives in the study of the political. Against this backdrop, we take stock of how the \"gender and politics\" field has developed over the years. We argue that the field has now entered a stage of \"consolidation\", which is reflected in the growth, diversification and professionalization of the subfield, as well as in the increased disciplinary recognition from major gatekeepers in political science. But while consolidation comes with specific opportunities, it also presents some key challenges. We identify five such challenges: (1) the potential fragmentation of the field; (2) persisting hierarchies in knowledge production; (3) the continued marginalization of feminist political analysis in \"mainstream\" political science; (4) the changing link between academia and society; and (5) growing opposition to gender studies in parts of Europe and beyond. We argue that both the \"gender and politics\" field and political science in general should address these challenges in order to become a truly inclusive discipline.",

Indeed, the subfield of \"gender and politics\" has flourished in European political science over the last twenty years: There has been the establishment of a conference * Silvia Erzeel silvia.erzeel@vub.be Extended author information available on the last page of the article and a new journal; gender, sexuality and intersectionality in the study of the political (and indeed what counts as the political) is increasingly recognized by the broader political science community (M\u00fcgge et al. 2016) ; and a growing number of scholars have revealed and contested biases against gender and politics research in the discipline and its institutions. We take stock of how the \"gender and politics\" field has developed over the past twenty years, taking 2001 as a starting point because it serves the purpose of this anniversary issue of European Political Science. The development of the \"gender and politics\"-subfield, however, has a longer history, and can be traced back to the late 1970s and 1980s (Costa and Sawer 2018; Lovenduski 2015) . Given that \"Gender and Politics\" can no longer be considered a \"new\" or \"emerging\" field of study (see Dahlerup 2010 for a comparison), we ask in this article whether the subfield has now entered a new stage of \"consolidation\" and what this means for both the field itself and the discipline of political science. In order to answer these questions, we scrutinize different indicators of consolidation. For analytical purposes, we consider consolidation as a twofold process, characterized by both internal and external developments. Internal consolidation relates to the growth and integration of gender and politics research into a specialist (sub)field and autonomous knowledge community in political science. External consolidation relates to the external recognition that gender and politics research has received from other (sub)fields and major gatekeepers in political science (such as major political science associations and journals).",

            "text": "For the purpose of this article, we define \"gender and politics\" as a subfield of political science that is primarily concerned with the study of gender, sexuality and/ or intersectionality perspectives in the study of the political. We, the authors, are committed to promoting a broad understanding of gender and politics research; we recognise the matrices of oppression that shape our politics and our societies (Hill Collins 2002) and the importance of intersectionality (Crenshaw 1991; Yuval-Davis 2012) as a lens with which to analyse \"complex gender equality\" (Verloo and Walby 2012) , comprising gender, class, race/ethnicity, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression and other categories of social inequalities. We are aware that our knowledge is situated within a political science context mostly informed by the canons of the discipline in Europe and the USA, which shapes the way we approach gender and politics research. This reminds us of the need to keep decolonizing the discipline (Medie and Kang 2018; Mendoza 2012) . 1 In the following sections, we reflect upon the internal and external consolidation of European gender and politics research over the last two decades. We consider the growth and increased professionalization of the subfield, as well as the increased recognition it receives from the broader discipline of political science. Next, we discuss five key challenges that hinder the further consolidation of the field: (1) the potential fragmentation and disintegration of the field, (2) persisting hierarchies in knowledge production, (3) the continued marginalization of feminist political analysis in \"mainstream\" political science, (4) the changing link between academia and \"society\", and (5) growing opposition to gender studies in several parts of Europe. We argue that both the \"gender and politics\"-field and political sciences more in general will have to take up these challenges in the future in order to \"become a truly inclusive discipline\"-a question the EPS editors rightfully posed in the call for papers for this anniversary issue.",

Research questions developed out of a concern to explore the diversity of perspectives present in political life, to highlight women's previously overlooked contributions to it, and to give a voice to their subjective experiences as marginalized groups. Recent studies pay relatively more attention to the study of gendered political processes, institutions and interactions. The research focus has shifted towards exposing and questioning gender hierarchies and inequalities in a variety of political phenomena. As part of this shift, increasing attention is also devoted to the study of men as \"gendered beings\" in politics (Connell 2002) and the interactions between gender and other social markers such as social class, ethnicity, race, sexual orientation, age and disability (Crenshaw 1991; Hancock 2007; McCall 2005) ; although these perspectives and voices are still at risk of being marginalized in the field (see below).",

Thus, its research is often characterized by a multi-and interdisciplinary engagement to a degree that is often usual for gender studies, but less so for \"mainstream\" political science (see also Costa and Sawer 2018) . Scholars within the politics and gender field often draw from a wide range of disciplinary backgrounds such as anthropology, economics, philosophy, sociology and others. A multi-or interdisciplinary lens allows gender and politics scholars to address political phenomena from a multiplicity of angles that enhance a comprehensive understanding of political problems. It also keeps scholars alert to the risk of becoming self-referential, which could narrow analytical capacities. Moreover, gender and politics research has also been shaped by different strands of political activism such as feminist, LGBTQI+ and anti-racist movements. Thus, politics and gender research can draw upon political sciences, gender studies, and activist involvement as related but distinct sources.",

The transnational ECPR Gender and Politics Standing Group established in 1986 (originally \"Women and Politics\") brings together scholars around the world working on gender, sexuality and intersectionality in politics. The creation of this network proved to be foundational to the development, and eventual consolidation, of gender and politics as a subfield in Europe, not least because it \"helped inspire activism and institutional transfer across European PSAs\" (Costa and Sawer 2018: 245) . Not only did such a network provide an intellectual network for those interested in similar research agendas but it also provided an important source of solidarity amongst scholars who very often found themselves to be marginalised within their own departments, universities and national political science associations. Not surprisingly, such politics and gender groups appear often to be among the biggest and most frequented PSA sub-entities and moreover extended their scope over time to include sexuality politics and intersectionality (Costa and Sawer 2018) . Similarly, the role of the ECPR standing group has expanded over time and it performs a number of important functions which have helped the field of gender and politics to flourish, including organising gender panels at \"mainstream\" political science conferences and, perhaps most importantly, the establishment of its own biennial conference, the European Conference on Politics and Gender (ECPG).",

As the subfield grew, so too did the number of research papers produced, and it became clear that despite the existence of a number of excellent gender and politics journals, there was a demand for more: accordingly, the European Journal of Politics and Gender was launched in 2017 (Ahrens et al. 2018) . The journal, like the conference, is committed to intellectual plurality-in terms of theoretical, methodological and empirical approaches. Its recent inclusion in SCOPUS rankings is testament to the quality of work published.",

As for external consolidation, the gender and politics research received growing recognition and has-according to Kantola and Lombardo (2016) -contributed to the study of politics in four crucial ways. First, it has encouraged scholars to raise new research questions and to rethink old ones. Rather than accepting the relative under-representation of women and gender issues in political life as an \"empirical reality\" (and therefore unworthy of scrutiny), gender and politics scholars have made them the centre point of attention, by asking what the causes and consequences of this under-representation are, and how we can assess the normative implications thereof.",

The Joint Sessions, which are organized annually and accommodate usually between 25 and 30 workshops, have continuously hosted one or two \"gender and politics\" workshops since 2007. At the General Conference, Europe's largest gathering of political scientists, sections devoted to gender and politics are also a regular feature. Since the General Conference became an annual event in 2014, the yearly academic programmes have included between two and six sections with a topical focus on gender, sexuality or intersectionality perspectives, each accommodating between three to eight panels. A quick calculation based on the information available on the ECPR website indicates that on average 4% of the total number of panels organized at the General Conference include gender, sexuality or intersectionality as a primary focus (Fig. 2) .

Each of these journals has a broad issue focus and welcomes contributions from a variety of subfields. Overall, the percentage of articles on gender and politics is not high-10% at best, but more often (much) lower; yet, some journals (e.g. EPS in 2001-2005 and 2016-2020) have increased the number of gender-related articles by publishing special issues or thematic sections on the topic. In the absence of a comparative yardstick, it is difficult to assess the level of gender mainstreaming in absolute terms. More important, therefore, is an assessment of over-time evolutions. In line with the findings for the conferences, there is also no clear upward trend in the number of publications on gender-related topics over time across the different journals (with the exception of EJPR). Rather, the overall picture that emerges is one of over-time fluctuations and stagnation. A combination of factors might account for these patterns, including author considerations regarding journal \"fit\" and success rates (Closa et al. 2020) , the composition of editorial boards and the gendered consequences thereof (Deschouwer 2020) , the gendered nature of the review and publication processes Table 1 Percentage of articles with primary focus on gender, sexuality and intersectionality in ECPR journals (2001-2020) Author calculations; data retrieved from Web of Science (https ://www.webof knowl edge.com, accessed on 27 October 2020) or from journal websites in case information on Web of Science was missing.

While such increased levels of specialisation have important benefits, including the development of particular knowledge and increased diversification, it also has some drawbacks. Specialization might result in disintegration and fragmentation. When different subfields (\"gender and political representation\", \"gender and European Union politics\", \"gender and social movements\", \u2026) become separate \"knowledge communities\" operating as \"self-contained silos made up of self-referential networks\" (Vickers 2015: 20) , the focus might shift from exchange between communities to exchange within communities. Not only might such a development limit the transfer of knowledge and innovation from one silo to another, it might also lead to the creation of \"echo-chambers of disconnected knowledge\" (Christensen and Ball 2019: 19) . This is obviously at odds with the initial multi-or interdisciplinary foundations of gender and politics-a field that has prided itself in the fact that it values cross-boundary exchange.",

Thinking honestly about the power implicit within the gender and politics field necessitates that we act differently and devise new ways of working that offer not only greater accessibility but also offer a radically different vision of what academia could be. In this instance then we call for a greater reflection on praxis, and specifically recalling the role that social movements play as a key source of gender and politics research.",

Interdisciplinarity and its importance for gender scholars is a critical aspect of this; avoiding the temptation to police the boundaries of politics and political science in order to create intellectual synergies across a variety of fields (Ashworth 2009 ). Refusing to shut down or close off what we consider political science to constitute is important, and mirrors concerns within feminist and LGBTIQ+ social movements (Braidotti 1991) , especially when we, as gender and politics scholars, recognise that politics is about power and that power is gendered (Ahrens et al. 2018) . Creating opportunities and spaces in which we pay attention to the politics of privilege but also to the politics of experiential knowledge, of standpoint theory, and of the politics of language, provides us with the opportunity to reimagine a more open and engaged political science. Bringing together the core strands within our field with theoretical frameworks which have not traditionally served as dominant frames or paradigms-notably postcolonial and decolonial theory-will raise fresh questions and challenges for us as a discipline forcing us to revisit received wisdoms, established concepts and traditional methods; for example, by making better use of decolonial research methods and better integrating participatory action research (PAR) into our methodology.",

Despite the evidence of its expansion and increasing consolidation in European political science, dominant approaches within the discipline, that according to a political science textbook open to pluralism such as Colin Hay's (2002) are rational choice theory, behaviouralism and new institutionalism, still tend to treat gender and sexuality issues as a marginal area (Kantola and Lombardo 2017; Smith and Lee 2015: 50) . Gender and sexuality teaching and research in European political science and other departments tends to be marginalized (M\u00fcgge et al. 2016) , demonstrating a resistance to mainstreaming gender by actors that seek to maintain their privileged status quo (Verge et al. 2018) . Men are overrepresented in the discipline and political science still perpetuates androcentric biases (Celis et al. 2013) . While, at the initiative of the ECPR, European political science journals are beginning to analyse their gender publication gap (Grossman 2020; Closa et al. 2020) , identifying a gender submission gap of 22% of at least one woman author in European Political Science Review and 27% woman leading author in the European Journal of Political Research, studies show that women are still underrepresented in political science publications despite their number in the discipline (Teele and Thelen 2017) . Gender citation gaps, produced by implicit biases, lack of senior women scholars, and men's tendency to cite men, are problematic for women's career advancement and create the perception that men's research is more important than women's (Brown and Samuels 2018) . Maliniak et al.'s (2013) analysis of IR top journals shows that articles authored by men obtain 4.8 more citations than women-authored articles in the period 1980-2006, after controlling for many variables. It was thanks to academic-activist platforms such as Women and People of Color Also Know Stuff! 3 that the lack of gender and diversity in conference panels, as well as the devaluing of women and people of colour's expertise in public institutions and the media was exposed (Wallace and Pepinsky 2019).",

Approaches that focus on the intersection of gender, race, ethnicity, class, sexuality, disability, age and other inequalities are recognised as important within the field, but are not consistently applied in research. Two approaches remain more marginal: discursive approaches, that focus on how gender is contested and constructed in political debates, and post-deconstruction approaches, that focus on the role of affects, emotions and bodily material in gender and politics.",

As Brown (2002) argues, connecting theory and political praxis is, indeed, needed to prevent debates within increasingly professionalized disciplines such as political science, from becoming self-referential and thus narrow in their analytical and imaginative capacities. Brown criticizes US political science as a professionalized discipline becoming accountable only to itself, where political scientists are their own audience and judges, and its existence justified by peer-reviewed journals, conferences and prizes (Brown 2002: 565) .",

Gender and politics scholars have demonstrated the multiple ways in which feminist academic knowledge and societal critique can become co-opted and compromised, thus losing its critical political edge when trying to fit with the prevailing logics of neoliberal governance (Caglar et al. 2013; Griffin 2015; Pr\u00fcgl 2016 ). New concepts such as market feminism (Kantola and Squires 2012) , governance feminism (Pr\u00fcgl 2016) , or crisis governance feminism (Griffin 2015) describe the transformations that engaging with neoliberal polities and policy-making brings for feminist knowledge. Consequently, some scholars argue that governance feminism has been markedly silent about the gendered underpinnings of global governance and financial governance, focusing instead on supporting institutional measures to enhance women's participation (Griffin 2015: 66) .",

Such strategies require both \"discursive virtuosity\" (speaking the right language without compromising one's agenda) but also \"affective virtuosity\", a term that Elom\u00e4ki et al. (2019) have coined to move forward from the pessimistic governance feminism interpretations of these engagements to instead point to the ambivalences in the engagement with the neoliberal governance. Whereas discursive virtuosity is about manifesting command of contradictory aims and discourses in equality work (Brunila 2009 ), affective virtuosity entails not only the competence to analyse and negotiate the conflicting emotions in the room but also within oneself. Affective virtuosity then requires controlling one's feelings and emotions in gender equality work that is done with practitioners, yet it also makes openings for moving forward the gender equality agendas in hostile environments (Elom\u00e4ki et al. 2019) .",

Similar anti-gender attacks increasingly appear also in other European countries, such as Poland, Italy, France, Romania and Bulgaria (Engeli 2020; Kuhar and Zobec 2017; Paternotte and Verloo 2020) .",

Over the years, we have witnessed several attempts of the anti-gender actors to establish an \"alternative\" field of knowledge production by negating \"gender\" as a concept and dismantling post-structural research in social sciences and humanities. Scientific journals run by anti-choice organizations, research institutes run by politicians, or methodologically problematic studies pushed through a peer review process and published in scientific journals, remain a key challenge for science and particularly gender and sexuality research 4 (Kuhar 2015; Paternotte and Verloo 2020) .

One way to respond to this demand is by organizing conference sections more along research topics or problems, and less along political science subfields, thereby potentially breaking up \"knowledge communities\" and promoting interdisciplinarity as an advantage.",

They can also promote positive action policies (quotas, awards, and recognition of support) for gender, sexuality and intersectionality research(ers).
