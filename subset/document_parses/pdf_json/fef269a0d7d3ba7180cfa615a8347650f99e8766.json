The novel severe acute respiratory distress syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has literally urged bench and clinical researchers to not only think \"out of the box\" but also to utilise treatments, especially in early 2020, based only on pathophysiological assumptions rather than data on randomised control trials (RCTs) or at least observational studies. Therefore, during the first semester of 2020, a vigorous everlasting scientific exchange of information was held often leading to a total reversal of \"current best-practice\".",

            "text": "On the other hand, Cure et al. [6] supported that colchicine was not only ineffective in COVID-19 patients, but could also exert a negative effect. However, one-by-one the arguments posed by Cure et al. have been seriously challenged by Parra-Medina et al. [7] , Kobak [8] and Piantoni et al. [9] . Unfortunately, this is not clearly presented in the review by Rizk et al. [1] therefore providing a misleading picture. In particular, acute respiratory distress syndrome has been reported only after toxic doses of colchicine (i.e. 80 mg of colchicine or 1.6 mg/kg; 15-20 mg or 0.25-0.3 mg/kg) while common therapeutic doses in gout and utilised in COVID-19 protocols are in the range of a total dose of 1-1.5 mg per day (not per kg; i.e. 20-to 80-times lower doses) [4, 7] . Further, to the best of our knowledge, there is no evidence that colchicine at therapeutic doses may reduce the release of surfactants by affecting alveolar type II pneumonocytes. In support of our argument, no references are cited by Cure al [6] or by Rizk et al. [1] , who include this statement. Conversely, in a pre-print by Dupuis et al. (17 July 2020; https ://doi.org/10.21203 /rs.3.rs-43204 /v1), colchicine was administered in an experimental study and authors reported a reduced acute lung injury and improved blood oxygenation by reducing lung neutrophil recruitment in rats pre-treated with colchicine.",

Study results became available on the 24th of June 2020, i.e. after the authors declared last day of literature search. GRECCO-19 was the first published RCT on the effects of colchicine in COVID-19 and showed a beneficial effect. In particular, patients under colchicine treatment had statistically significantly improved time to clinical deterioration, mainly driven by less need for invasive mechanical respiratory support. Moreover, a potential antithrombogenic effect was observed as colchicine attenuated maximum D-dimer levels [10] . Indeed, adverse events, with the exception of the expected gastrointestinal side effects of colchicine (none of which were serious), were comparable between the two groups [10] . On top of these findings, more recently, the COLCORONA study (NCT04322682) has officially been reported to have passed futility test in interim analyses. Therefore, we shall await with great interest results from COLCORONA study.",
