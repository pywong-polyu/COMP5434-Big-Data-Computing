We use changes in mobility to capture the impact that non-pharmaceutical interventions and other behaviour changes have on the rate of transmission of SARS-CoV-2. We estimate that R t was only below one in 23 states on 1st June. We also estimate that 3.7% [3.4%-4.0%] of the total population of the US had been infected, with wide variation between states, and approximately 0.01% of the population was infectious.

In April 2020, the number of deaths attributed to COVID-19 in the United States (US) surpassed that of Italy 2 . Courtemanche et al. 3 used an event-study model to determine that such NPIs were successful in reducing the growth rate of COVID-19 cases across US counties. We similarly seek to estimate the impact of NPIs on COVID-19 transmission, but through a semi-mechanistic Bayesian model that reflects the underlying process of disease transmission and relies on mobility data released by companies such as Google 4 .",

We calculated the number of new infections through combining previous infections with the generation interval (the distribution of times between infections) and chose the number of deaths to be a function of the number of infections and the infection fatality ratio (IFR). We estimated the posterior probability of our parameters given the observed data, while incorporating prior uncertainty. This made our approach empirically driven, whilst incorporating uncertainty.

We utilise partial pooling of parameters, where information is shared across all states to leverage as much signal as possible, but individual effects are also included for state and region-specific idiosyncrasies. In this paper, we infer plausible upper and lower bounds (Bayesian credible interval summaries of our posterior distribution) of the total population that had been infected by COVID-19 on 01 June 2020 (also called the cumulative attack rate or attack rate) and estimate the effective number of individuals currently infectious given our generation distribution. We also present effect sizes of the mobility covariates and make short-term forecasts, which we compare with reality throughout June.

New York and New Jersey had the highest estimated cumulative attack rates, of 15.9% [12.4%-19 .9%] and 14.8% [11.2%-18 .2%] respectively, and Connecticut and Massachusetts both had cumulative attack rates over 10%. Conversely, other states that have drawn attention for early outbreaks, such as California, Washington, and Florida, only had cumulative attack rates of around 2% and states that were only in the early stages of their epidemics, like Maine, had estimated cumulative attack rates of <1%. Figure 1 shows the effective number of infectious individuals and the number of newly infected individuals on any given day up until 01 June 2020 for each of the 8 regions in our model, which are based on US census regions (see Supplementary Note 1 for further descriptions of our groupings). The effective number of infectious individuals is calculated using the generation time distribution, where individuals are weighted by how infectious they are over time, see section \"Generated quantities\" for more information. The fully infectious average includes asymptomatic and symptomatic individuals. On 01 June 2020, we estimate that there were 41,100 [34,500-46,800] infectious individuals across the US, which corresponds to 0.01% of the population. Table 1 shows estimates of the number of new infections across each states on 01 June 2020.

Column 3 of Table 1 shows the value of the infection ascertainment ratio in our model (see section \"Methods\") and varies significantly between state. We would not expect the infection ascertainment to be 100% because our model includes asymptomatic individuals who may not know they have COVID-19.

Supplementary Note 7 shows the mobility trends for the 50 states and the District of Columbia up until 01 June 2020 (see section \"Data\" for a description of the mobility dimensions). The median correlation between the observed average mobility and the timing of the introduction of major NPIs (represented as step functions) was~86% (see Supplementary Note 8). We make no explicit causal link between NPIs and mobility because this relationship is plausibly causally linked by other factors. The mobility trends data suggests that substantial early outbreak in New York state may have led to substantial changes in mobility in nearby states, like Connecticut, prior to any mandated interventions in those states, which supports including regions in our model. Including both mobility trends and the timing of imposition and lifting of \"stay-at-home\" orders did not affect the estimated cumulative attack rates (see Supplementary Note 9). Mobility alone cannot fully capture how transmission evolves over time. In particular, it cannot capture the impact of casebased interventions (such as testing and tracing) or behaviour changes (such as mask wearing or hand-washing). We use a second-order, weekly, autoregressive process to allow our changes in transmission to be decoupled from mobility. This autoregressive process is an additional term in our parametric equation for R t and accounts for residual effects by capturing a correlation structure where current R t is correlated with previous weeks R t . This means that our forecasts were equally good whatever combination of mobility covariates were used because this term could capture the unexplained behaviour. The learnt random effects from this process are shown in Supplementary Note 10 for all states along with the contributions to R t from the mobility and autoregressive terms for three example states. The autoregressive term increases R t before lockdown in New York, which could be explained by behaviour such as panic buying. In contrast, the autoregressive term reduces R t in Montana and could reflect behavioural changes such as hand-washing and self isolation, which can reduce transmission with maintained mobility levels. The autoregressive term remains mostly constant in Washington and suggests that mobility is sufficient to capture the behaviour there.",

Despite this, the cumulative attack rate across the US still remained low. We found our attack rate for New York was in line with those from recent serological studies 10 . There is now evidence that mild infection is able to lead to robust immunity (via T cells) but potentially not induce antibody production, which are detected in serosurveys 11 . Therefore, serosurveys might underestimate exposure, particularly in mild cases, and our model may provide an alternative way to measure population exposure. Our cumulative attack rates are, however, sensitive to the assumed values of infection fatality rate (IFR). We account for each individual state's age structure, and further adjust for contact mixing patterns 12 , but age-specific modelling may be necessary to capture potential changes in the demographics of cases in states such as Texas, Florida and South Carolina where there is evidence that younger people than were infected at the start of the epidemic are being infected 13, 14 .",

We compared our estimates with predictions made by rt.live 15 who use a method that fits the most likely R t curve to the daily new daily cases (see Supplementary Note 11). Overall, our estimates were weakly correlated (\u03c1 = 0.42) with both of us estimating R t > 1 in 23 states (red points), including Montana and Alaska. However, the rt.live estimates are slightly more pessimistic because they predict R t > 1 in ten states where we predict R t < 1 (blue points). In contrast we predict R t > 1 in five states where they predict R t < 1 (green points). Both sets of reproduction numbers strongly implied that the US epidemic was not under control in many states, and that in the presence of continued migration and the loosening of interventions seen in June, increased infections were to be expected with high probability. We found that state with high reproduction numbers on 01 June 2020 were geographically clustered in the west and south US, whilst the states that had suffered high COVID-19 mortality (such as the Northeast Corridor) in the early phase of the epidemic had lower reproduction numbers. After the period covered by this study, reported cases began to increase in the US, and seven states (Arizona, Arkansas, California, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee and Texas) had recorded higher levels of hospitalisations in early July than before 16, 17 .

These forecasts, alongside our R t values, show that the epidemic was not under control at the end of May. The accuracy of our forecasts varied during the epidemic and could be due to our assumption that mobility is kept constant over these 3 weeks. Our forecast would perform worse in weeks where mobility was significantly different to the last week of our model fit. When we include cases in our model, we are able to get similar results to a simple \"null\" model whilst also being about to estimate effect sizes of different mobility trends. We also compared our cumulative death forecasts with those presented by Friedman et al. 18 . Friedman et al. compared the median absolute percentage error (MAPE) for SEIR and dynamic growth rate types of models for models fit to some point in June. Unlike those models, we find the MAPE of our cumulative death forecasts did not increase significantly over time and our 3-week median cumulative death MAPE across all states (9.9%) was similar to the US estimate from Our model uses mobility to predict SARS-COV2 transmission. We find that the timings that non-pharmaceutical interventions were implemented was strongly correlated to changes in mobility. This is similar to findings in Abouk and Heydari 5 who find that statewide stay-at-home orders had the strongest causal impact on reducing social interaction and that these orders significantly increase the presence of individuals at home by about six fold (our \"residential mobility trend\"). This supports our choice of using mobility instead of the timings of NPIs in this study instead of the times of interventions as in Flaxman et al. 6 . We find that magnitude of the reductions in average mobility, and the resulting increases in residential mobility, are important in determining the size of reduction in R t . This agrees with Wang et al. 19 who use a stochastic age-and risk-structured susceptible-exposed-asymptomatic-symptomatic-hospitalised-recovered (SEAYHR) model to considered the effect of various levels of social distancing. They found that social distancing measures, which reduced nonhousehold contacts by <50%, would not prevent a healthcare crisis and that only their 75% and 90% contact reduction scenarios were projected to enable metropolitan areas to remain within healthcare levels.",

We pool parameters in our model to leverage as much signal in our data as possible and to reflect the conjoined nature of some states, in particular in the Northeastern Corridor. While this sharing can potentially lead to over or under estimation of effect sizes, it also means that a consistent signal for all states can be estimated before that signal is presented in an individual state with little data, such as Alaska and Hawaii.

In this paper, we also include the reported number of cases after 11 May 2020, see Supplementary Note 13. This reflects the point in time when over 375,000 tests were being done each day across the US. We include this in our likelihood but do not use them to calculate transmission directly. We parametrise R t as a function of Google mobility data and include an autoregressive term to capture non-mobility driven behaviour. We fit our model jointly to COVID-19 data from all states to assess the attack rates and number of people who were currently infected. Finally, we use our model to forecast for 3 weeks from 01 June 2020 and compare our estimates of deaths to those recorded in the US for each state. We assume mobility remains constant at the previous value of mobility on the same day the previous week in our forecasts and the autoregressive term remains constant. Data. Our model uses daily real-time state-level aggregated data published by New York Times (NYT) 21 for New York State and John Hopkins University (JHU) 2 for the remaining states. We include 105,006 deaths in our model up until 1 June and 479,422 cases from 11 May to 1 June. Age-specific population counts were drawn from the U.S. Census Bureau in 2018 22 to estimate state-specific infection fatality ratio reflective of the population age structure. The timing of NPIs were collated by the University of Washington 23 . We used Google's COVID-19 Community Mobility Report 4 , which provides data on movement in the US by states and highlights the percent change in visits to:",

An average is taken as these dimensions are strongly collinear.are the mobility trends for places of residences. We include regional, as well as state-level parameters, in our model to encapsulate the connected nature of states. This was particularly important in the Northeasten corridor where residents in New Jersey and Connecticut regularly commuted into New York, the early epicentre of the US epidemic (see Supplementary Note 1 for a map of the regions). Regions are based on US Census Divisions, modified to account for coordination between groups of state governments 27 .We assume that seeding of new infections begins 30 days before the day after a state has cumulatively observed 10 deaths. From this date, we seed our model with 6 sequential days of an equal number of infections:where \u03c4~Exponential(0.03). These seed infections are inferred in our Bayesian posterior distribution.The weekly, state-specific effect is modelled as a weekly AR(2) process, centred around 0 with stationary standard deviation \u03c3 w that, in every state, starts on the first day of its seeding of infections, i.e., 30 days before a total of 10 cumulative deaths have been observed in this state. The AR(2) process starts withwith independent priors on \u03c1 1 and \u03c1 2 that are normal distributions conditioned to be in [0, 1]; the prior for \u03c1 1 is a N \u00f00:8; 0:05\u00de distribution conditioned to be in [0, 1] and the prior for \u03c1 2 is a N \u00f00:1; 0:05\u00de distribution, conditioned to be in [0, 1]. The prior for \u03c3 w , the standard deviation of the stationary distribution of \u03f5 w is chosen as \u03c3 w $ N \u00fe \u00f00; 0:2\u00de. The standard deviation of the weekly updates to achieve this standard deviation of the stationary distribution isThe conversion from days to weeks is encoded in w m (t). Every 7 days, w m is incremented, i.e., we set w m \u00f0t\u00de \u00bc b\u00f0t \u00c0 t start m \u00de=7c \u00fe 1, where t start m is the first day of seeding. We keep the AR (2) process constant over the last 7 days of observations since this is less informed by data due to the lags and also over the forecast period.The prior distribution for the shared coefficients were chosen to be \u03b1 k $ N \u00f00; 0:5\u00de; k \u00bc 1;and the prior distribution for the pooled coefficients were chosen to be \u03b1 region r;l $ N \u00f00; \u03b3 r \u00de; r \u00bc 1;We estimated parameters jointly for all states in a single hierarchical model. Fitting was done in the probabilistic programming language Stan 20 using an adaptive Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) sampler.Generated quantities. The effective number of infectious individuals, i * , on a given day considers how infectious a previously infected individual is on a given day and includes both asymptotic and symptomatic individuals. It is calculated by first re-scaling the generation distribution by its maximum, i.e., g \u00c3 \u03c4 \u00bc g \u03c4 max t g t . Based on (2), the number of infectious individuals is then calculated from the number of previously infected individuals, c, using the following:where i t,m is the number of new infections on day t in state m.Reporting summary.
