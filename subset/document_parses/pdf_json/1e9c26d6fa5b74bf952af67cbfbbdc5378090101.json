The common theme emerging out of the scrutiny is that most systems across the world are not capable of identifying and addressing the needs of susceptible groups of individuals who need protection and specialised care during times of crisis.The susceptible groups like the elderly and those with chronic, diseases like psychiatric illness(3), malignancies(4)and autoimmune inflammatory rheumatic diseases (AIRD) (5, 6) have been badly affected during this pandemic. Given the abrupt changes caused by the pandemic and the mitigation measures imposed by the government, individuals who have a poor physical and functional status are likely to be affected the most. Among AIRDs, scleroderma or systemic sclerosis ( SSc) has a very high rate of mortality and morbidity (7, 8) with patients having poor physical and functional status.",

Tele-rheumatology has not only helped patients seek timely healthcare but also has enabled clinicians effectively manage patient cohorts and continue research in a modified manner(12). The data generated by the tele-rheumatology consults and questionnaire based surveys will be handy in preparing for further catastrophes and addressing myths and beliefs among patients and their care providers. In this context there are limited studies done to understand the accessibility and availability of drugs used in rheumatology practice and health care services during the nation-wide lockdown. Also, there have been limited attempts to understand the challenges faced,health beliefs and practices of patients with SSc. Thus, this study aimed to determine the healthcare impact of COVID-19 pandemic by tele-consultationand the issues faced in continuing medications among the patients enrolled in theIndianProgressive Systemic Sclerosis Registry (IPSSR). We also analysed the psychosocial impact of COVID-19 pandemic on scleroderma patients and sought to understand the measures taken by patients with SSc to protect themselves from the SARS CoV 2 infection during the peak of the pandemic in India. and are followed up at 3 monthly intervals across all the centres. Institute ethics approval was obtained by all the participating centres. The present telemedicine-based study was designed to establish contact with the patients enrolled in the registry during the time of COVID-19. A questionnaire with 25 items was developed in English language by 2 experienced rheumatologists (Supplementary Data S1, available at Rheumatology Advances in Practice online). These questions were then discussed with the investigators from all the participating centres and finalised. The questions covered issues on healthcare delivery, medical complications during the lockdown, COVID related symptoms if any, preventive measures practiced by the patients and psychosocial issues. The questionnaire was then administered in the vernacular languages to research team by the rheumatologists to test for interlanguage reliability with the answers obtained (14) . After ascertaining the reliability of the questions, all the enrolled patients were contacted between October 2020 and January 2021on their registered mobile/telephone numbers and email ids. Those patients who consented to participate in the study were administered the questionnaire by a trained speciality nurse over telephone, WhatsApp, email or a video consult which was supervised by a rheumatologist. Verbal consent was obtained from the patients prior to administration of the questionnaire and waiver of written consent was obtained as this was a telemedicine-based study.",

The participants were not offered any kind of incentive for participating in the study. Once the questionnaire was filled, completeness check and multiple entries check was done by manually screening the entries by the study nurse. This was followed by telephonically assessing the scleroderma health associated questionnaire (SHAQ) and hospital anxiety depression scale (HADS). A HADS score of above 7 was considered abnormal for depression and anxiety separately (15) . The patients were also allowed to revise their previous responses if required during this call (16) .

Most patients also practiced some unproven infection mitigation measures like washing the clothes of the person stepping out of the house in a separate batch (80%) and having bath after getting back home in case she/ he ventured out, besides taking prophylactic complementary alternative medicines and vitamins. It is yet to be understood if these behaviour changes were a result of fear of the pandemic or due to the sense of being frail among patients of AIRDs.Several symptoms like cough, dyspnoea and diarrhoea which qualify for screening of COVID-19 infection were seen among patients with SSc but were not due to COVID-19. Similar incidence of probable and definite symptoms of COVID-19 infection among patients with SSc has also been reported from Italy (26) . Most of these symptoms are not specific for COVID and can also be seen with worsening diseases activity in SSc. It is important for the physicians treating COVID-19 to judiciously screen these patients for infections and fast-track the referral of these patients to a specialist if negative for infection. This will help the rheumatologist to optimise treatment for SSc, thus preventing long term complications. Over 30% of patients had abnormal scores for depression and anxiety. The prevalence of abnormal scores in patients with rheumatic diseases are similar to those reported from other countries (27) . Our study, shows association between worsening of SSc symptoms not only with drug discontinuation but also with psychological stressors like job loss and family members being diagnosed with COVID-19. This highlights the need to have a holistic approach and to include management of mental health problems among these patients. These psycho-socioeconomic and clinical factors seem to be reflected in the higher association with depression and anxiety scores among our patients. Though we do not have a pre COVID value of HADS, the factors associated with higher scores shows the high indirect morbidity in SSc during the pandemic.",

Besides these, being a questionnaire-based survey, the study may have response bias, where the individual may have over or under scored the questions. But there are a few strengths, that could negate these short comings.",

A close and complementary working between governmental agencies and private players to ensure continuity of care, availability of drugs and optimisation of teleconsultation for specialist opinion will help us mitigate these challenges to a large extent. Besides addressing these aspects, mechanisms to address the mental health issues needs to be devised urgently to help patients with SSc cope with the circumstances. Such working models can be extrapolated to the care of most of the chronic diseases and can go a long way in strengthening our healthcare system. ",

Female: Male ratio of the patients in the cohort was 12.4:1 with a duration of illness ranging from 24 to 96 months with a median of 48 months. Out of the 336 patients who participated in the study 189 (56.3%) had a diffuse cutaneous SSc phenotype and 123 (36.6%) had limited cutaneous SSc. Data about the subtype of SSc was not available for 11 (3.3%) patients. The average monthly income of the families of the patients was INR 10000 (IQR 5000 to 20000) [USD 137.4 (IQR-68.7 to 274.8)].Logistics and health care related challenges during pandemicWe found that 310 (92.3%) patients missed their scheduled outpatient (OPD) visit and 75(22.3%)    had to skip their prescription medications. While 52 patients (15.4%) skipped the medicationsfor 1 month at the most, 23 patients (6.9%) skipped medicationsfor more than a month. The reasons for missing the OPD visits were pandemic fear, lack of transportation, OPD cancellation among others and the reasons for skipping the prescription drugs were financial constraints and non-availability(Figure 1). Among those who managed to continue the medications (n=272) despite the lockdown and containment measures, the various modalities by which they obtained the drugs were online pharmacy, primary health care centres, doctor's help, medical representatives and Asha worker (Figure 1). During the lockdown 185 (55.1%) patients were contacted and assisted by their health teams prior to the current call and the commonest mode of contact was telephone call followed by WhatsApp mobile App and video call. Due to the lockdown measures 75 (22.3%) families had a family member lose their jobs and 155 (46.1%) faced financial difficulties (Table 2). Besides these 116 (34.5%) patients had to spend extra to get treatment for SSc and the average extra amount spent wasINR 4000 (range -2000 to 10000) [USD 54.9 (Range 27.5 to 137.4)]. Covid-like manifestations and preventive measures Between March 2020 and December 2020, 35 patients (10.4%) had at least one symptom of COVID-19 which included fever (n=27) (8.0%), cough (n=28) (8.3%), new onset or worsening breathlessness (n=24) (7.1%), 2 patients developed diarrhoea whereas 3 patients had anosmia. Test for COVID-19 was done for 59 patients (17.6%) and real time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) confirmed infection in 4 patients. None of the SSc patients with the SARS CoV-2 infection needed hospitalisation and at the time of call had completely recovered from it (Table 3). Most (>96%) of the contacted patients were aware about preventive measures against COVID-19 infection like maintaining social distancing, frequent hand washing, isolation and using face mask (Figure 1E). It was noticed that 91 patients (27.1%) have had taken unproven prophylactic medications to prevent themselves from COVID-19 infection. These prophylactic medications or supplements included ayurvedic medicines (n=37), homeopathic medicines (n=48) or remedies like zinc (n=30) (8.9%),",

Studies conducted before the peak of COVID-19 in India also reported low rates of COVID-19 infection among patients of SLE(20)(12). However, we must interpret the results of our study with caution as the status and outcome of individuals who were not reachable by the medical teams are yet to be known. Moreover, the infection was cured without any unfavourable outcomes in all these patients even though all of them were on immunosuppressant medications again reaffirming the fact that patients with AIRDs may have similar outcomes of COVID-19 infection as the general population(21).",
