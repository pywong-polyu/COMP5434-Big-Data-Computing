And the nursing experience about this disease is rare reported. Case presentation: This study reported a 50-year-old man with adenoid cystic carcinoma in left main bronchus by computed tomography (CT), fiberoptic bronchoscopy, and puncture biopsy. The case is the first report about operation method and the comprehensive nursing care, including conventional nursing, airway management, fluid management, nutritional support, and psychosocial support for patients undergoing primary bronchial malignancy resection and left pneumonectomy. After multidisciplinary treatment and comprehensive care, the patient was cured and discharged on the 17th day after surgery. Conclusion: This study reported a rare case with bronchial malignancy resection and left pneumonectomy and discussed its nursing care. A skilled management of ECMO, intraoperative position transformation, and prevention, as well as control of pulmonary complications are fundamental in caring patients with bronchial tumors. Monitoring of pulmonary function and blood pressure, adequate nutrition, and psychological support could be contributing factors for successful treatment during the postoperative stage.",

Malignant tumors between bone and carina that are common to the junction of the cartilage ring with the membranous part [1] . It is relatively rare, occurring in only one in a million of all malignancies [2] . Patients with primary bronchial malignancy may suffer from cough, dyspnea, chest pain, hemoptysis, etc. The diagnosis of bronchial malignancy is primarily based on fiberoptic bronchoscopy and computed tomography (CT) of the chest. The pathological types included squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) [3] . Surgery is currently the most effective treatment of primary bronchial malignancy [4] . However, the existing literature fails to provide standards of indications and surgical treatment for primary bronchial malignancy, and there is still a lack of a standardized approach to treatment [5] . This study sheds new light on surgery as well as comprehensive nursing care for patients with bronchial malignancy. It is expected that this report will provide a useful reference for future bronchial malignancy treatment.",

Considering the risk of traditional left thoracic approach cause by aorta block, the oncology, radiotherapy, intensive medicine, anesthesia, and pathology department were combined for multidisciplinary consultation. A sequential right-left bilateral thoracic approach was chosen for the surgery after discussion. On April 2, 2020, the patient underwent a thoracoscopicassisted and ECMO-supported right-left sequential bilateral thoracic approach to the lower tracheal carina and left pneumonectomy for lung cancer radical surgery, pleural adhesion, and cauterization, as well as fenestration of pericardium under general anesthesia. During the operation, the VV-ECMO (veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation) mode of the femoral vein and internal jugular vein was used. Firstly, the patient was under a right lateral position, then the carina and the lower segment of the trachea were dissociated, and 3 cm above the carina, the lower segment of the trachea was separated. After the right main bronchus was fully exposed, the lower position of it was severed from the carina. The 4-0PDS (Polydioxanone) line was used to anastomose the trachea with the right main trachea to ensure the continuity of trachea. After anastomosis, no air leakage was found in the water test, and lung swelling was good, then one thoracic tube was retained. Secondly, the patient was shifted to the left lateral position, and separated the left superior pulmonary vein and the left pulmonary artery trunk in sequence, while the pulmonary artery trunk was blocked for 10 min. The proximal end of the pulmonary artery was cut off when respiratory circulation was stable. After ligated the distal then cutt off the blood vessel, the left pulmonary vein and the left main bronchus, and finally taken out of the left lung specimen.

Pulmonary infection was demonstrated to be the highest mortality complication because of early or delayed treatment for ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome) after pneumonectomy. It was essential to clear up airway secretions timely to prevent lung infection caused by weak cough and sputum. Effective respiratory function training played a significant role in improving patients' pulmonary function and preventing postoperative pulmonary infection [6] . There needed some precautions for removing secretions after the operation: (1) The nurse instructed the patient to exercise respiratory function in bed every 2 h, to ensure him cough and expectorate effectively. (2) On the first day, the right main bronchus and subordinate lobar bronchus were cleaned with a fiberoptic bronchoscope and normal saline irrigation and aspiration were performed to remove the bloody viscous secretion. Then visible fiberoptic bronchoscopy was performed every 2 days to aspirate sputum, which effectively improved the symptoms of pulmonary infection. (3) The patient's weak constitution and excision of the carina, leaded to the poor cough and sputum after surgery. In addition, the adequate drainage of the respiratory secretions were not able to be guaranteed, for the limited activity of respiratory cilia caused by the negative balance. The nurse was encouraged to pat the back and guide the patient to cough and expectorate every 2 h without affecting the patient's rest. The nurse assessed patient's coughinduced pain, monitored the nature, volume, and color of sputum. Furthermore, evaluating the pulmonary function daily was essential to prevent complications, such as bronchopleural fistula and pneumothorax.",

Firstly, doctors resected carina and reconstructed the bronchial of the lower end of the bronchus through the right and left sequential bilateral thoracic cavities, and then carried out left pneumonectomy through the left thoracic cavity. As this operation program was the first case in China, both EMCO nursing and posture conversion were important. The insertion of the ECMO pipeline might promote and consume coagulation and anticoagulant components because it would cause many inflammatory reactions [8] .

After fully assessed the risks and identified the demand of the patient's position, the anesthesiologist stood next to the patient's cephalic side to ensure the ventilation of the artificial airway. Meanwhile, an ICU doctor stood at the end of the bed to fix the patient's lower limbs and observed various parameters of ECMO machines to ensure the blood flow.

Appropriate restriction of liquid intake was beneficial to improve postoperative oxygenation and promote the recovery of lung function [14] . Swartz et al. [15] reported that the mortality of cardiopulmonary complications was only 2.6% when the fluid volume was less than 1000 ml in the first 12 h after the operation. When the fluid volume exceeded 1000 ml, the mortality rose sharply to 17.3%. The patient received 1095 ml of intravenous infusion within 24 h on the first postoperative day, with a total output of 1270 ml (820 ml of urine and 450 ml of right thoracic drainage) and a total balance of \u2212 175 ml. The excessive intravenous infusion might result in pulmonary edema, whereas insufficient volume might lead to tissue hypoperfusion. We strictly controlled and stabilized the infusion, and the pump speed was set to 100 ml/h. The patient suffered from arrhythmia due to low blood volume with a heart rate of 148 beats/min, then amiodarone injection of 0.3 g and 5% glucose injection of 44 ml were pumped with a micropump of 7 ml/h rate. The patient's heart rate recovered to 106 beats/min 30 min later. Amiodarone was given last for 7 days after surgery. The urine volume was monitored and maintained at 0.5~1.0 ml/kg by a comprehensive assessment of the patient's previous blood pressure level and effective circulation rate. Moreover, nurses evaluated and managed the patient's fluid balance and effective circulation volume per shift to ensure the fluid intake and output balance or relative negative balance to minimize pulmonary edema [16] .",

The patient was vulnerable to malnutrition. At admission day, the NRS 2002 score of the patient was 1 point. On the 2nd to 10th day of admission, nutritional indicators such as red blood cells hemoglobin, total protein, albumin, etc. were in the normal range, but there was a downward trend (Fig. 4) . Parenteral nutrition support was given according to the doctor's advice. The patient was able to tolerant of surgery, although there existed a slight nutritional risk. After the operation, NRS2002 score of the patient was 3 point, which related to the restriction of fluid intake, negative balance, and limited intravenous nutrition supplement after left lung resection. The patient stayed in bed for a long time, resulting in poor body activity and gastrointestinal peristalsis, and inadequate diet. The medical care team and nutritionists had jointly formulated the patient's postoperative diet and nutrition plan, evaluated the gastrointestinal function and adjusted the diet plan dynamically. Relating drugs were given to regulate the intestinal flora and to facilitate the recovery of gastrointestinal function. Nutritional assistance was also supported which included parenteral and oral nutrition, such as human albumin and semi-liquid digestible food. The nurse auscultated bowel sounds per shift and observed gastrointestinal symptoms. Until discharge, the nutritional status of the patient was stable; the results of the postoperative blood test are shown in the figure below (Fig. 5 ).",
