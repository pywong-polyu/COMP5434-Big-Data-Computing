Due to the lack of strict mechanistic explanation of transmission and disease etiology (such as incubation period, latent period, and infectious period), the application of the logistic models in human epidemiology is not as extensive as that of transmission dynamic models such as susceptible-infectiveremoved (SIR) and susceptible-exposed-infective-asymptomaticremoved (SEIAR) models (1, 2, 17) . However, its simplicity, low parameter requirements, and ability to visualize and rapidly reflect the prevalence of an epidemic have given it a place in the study of mechanistic models (18, 19) , especially considering the urgency and severe consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic for public health management and decision-making. In the context of COVID-19, the LDE model was used to explain the epidemic (20) (21) (22) . Studies have demonstrated that the LDE model can show differences in key disease dynamic parameters before and after interventions in China (17) and can determine when the rate of epidemic growth decreases (2) . The generalized logistic differential equation (GLDE) model has also been used in practical applications (1, 21, (23) (24) (25) (26) . For example, studies have used the GLDE model to make simple predictions of the transmission potential and end time of the COVID-19 pandemic, which suggests it is a valuable tool for characterizing the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 (19) and the effectiveness of interventions (27) .",

As mentioned in our research (32) , although the results show good fitness, there were limitations. The LDE model requires data symmetry and is not suitable for long-term fitting. However, the actual data are asymmetric and the fitting curve is \"narrower and taller\" or \"broader and shorter\" than the actual curve when using the LDE model. The GLDE model adds shape parameters based on the LDE model to compensate for these drawbacks. Therefore, we intend to use COVID-19 data from Wuhan City to compare and analyze the advantages and disadvantages of these models in simulating infectious diseases and to generalize and validate them in other diseases.",

Only the outlier segmentation point of B (Yamagata lineage) in 2011 was used, and the other outliers were at their peak. The goodness-offit test showed that both methods could be used to data fit the outliers and, except for the LDE model in the form of B (Yamagata lineage) in 2011, the GLDE model fitted the remaining exceptions better. The derivation process of the LDE and GLDE models indicates that the models are highly stable. Individual values do not affect the overall shape of the disease epidemic curve due to long-term dispersal fluctuations. Therefore, the appearance of individual outliers does not affect the fit. Due to shape parameters being introduced, the GLDE may better fit the emergent outliers. For data with a bifurcated peak, if it was not obvious, we ignored the bifurcation point and directly fit the entire segment, such as the thirteenth segment of A (H1N1) seasonal data. If it was obvious, we used the bifurcation point to segment, such as in the sixth and seventh segments of A (H1N1). The test results confirmed that with the two methods, the data could be fitted, but the GLDE model fitted better.

This may be because the assumption provided by the LDE model was that the data should be continuous and the data characteristics should be distributed. The \"0\" value often appeared in scattered data; therefore, the LDE and GLDE models were less commonly used for fitting scattered data. This is why outbreak, epidemic, and pandemic data were chosen when fitting data from different epidemic intensities. The test results also showed that the GLDE fitted well.

            "text": "In summary, although the logistic model is simple and rough, it accurately fits the disease data and describes the epidemic dynamics. The LDE and GLDE models can be used to fit epidemic data at different levels. The GLDE model fits the actual data more accurately than the LDE model, and the same result can be seen in Pelinovsky's research (23) . The approximation accuracy increased significantly using the GLDE model than the LDE model, including the data for which the simple LDE model was not suitable. Studies (44, 45) also found that the introduction of the shape parameter within the GLDE model significantly improved the adjustment compared with the LDE model. Due to the significant contribution of the shape parameter, the GLDE model can not only better approximate the dynamics of data but can also capture the real data better. As the LDE model has limitations regarding the requirements for a skewed data distribution, in addition, over a long period, the parameters are not stable due to the interference factors changing, which render the LDE model unsuitable for fitting long-term epidemic data. The GLDE model is more suitable for fitting various distribution data and has better goodness-of-fit than LDE model, and this improvement is partly due to the additional parameter based on the LDE model. In fact, it is the result of the general statistical rule that the increase of the number of approximate curve parameters leads to the increase of the coefficient of determination (23) . Therefore, the GLDE model may have the problem of overfitting. In practical application, we need to select an appropriate model based on the specific distribution of data. For asymmetrically distributed disease data, the GLDE model demonstrates greater flexibility and better fitting accuracy.",

The scope of our study included infectious diseases with different transmission routes (respiratory tract transmission, enteric transmission, and contact transmission), different epidemic intensities (outbreak, epidemic, and pandemic), different time scales (day, week, and month), and different areas. Using R 2 , an indicator that reflects the goodnessof-fit, we found that the GLDE model provided a more accurate fit of data than the LDE model. Through the parametric test, we found that the LDE model provided earlier early warning week than the GLDE model. Therefore, we have reason to believe that the GLDE model is more advantageous in asymmetric infectious disease data simulation, however, its advantages of quantification in the middle and late stages of the epidemic, prediction, and early warning need to be further studied. In practice, we can choose appropriate models for disease prediction and early warning according to the region and the severity of the disease.",
