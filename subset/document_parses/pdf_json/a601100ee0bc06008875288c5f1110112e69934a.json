Methods We searched MEDLINE, Embase, and SCOPUS and included model-based evaluations of RSV vaccinations. Two reviewers performed the selection, data extraction, and quality evaluation with EVIDEM. Cost-effectiveness (CE) estimates were converted to $US purchasing power parity (PPP), year 2018 values. Potential economic and epidemiological outcomes were summarised for maternal, infant, children, and elderly vaccinations. The PROSPERO identifier is CRD42019122570. Results In total, 22 model-based studies were reviewed. On average, a potential 27% reduction in RSV hospitalisations in infants was projected for maternal vaccination and 50% for direct infant immunisation. The CE of maternal vaccination was $US1766-5857 PPP 2018/disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) for Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisation (Gavi)-eligible countries. For England, the maximum cost-effective price of maternal vaccination was estimated at $US81.5 PPP 2018. Infant vaccination was associated with higher CE ratios in low-and high-income settings. Vaccination of neonates born before the RSV season was the most cost effective in high-income settings. Higher values for vaccine effectiveness, duration of protection, and vaccine uptake increased the benefits. Due to indirect effects, the vaccination of school-age children and a cocooning strategy were effective alternatives to protect infants, and the vaccination of children aged < 5 years had a beneficial impact on the elderly. Conclusion RSV vaccines with anticipated characteristics may reduce a sizeable proportion of the RSV burden. The results are subject to uncertainty because of the limited epidemiological and clinical data. Data on RSV incidence and hospitalisation risk for granular age strata should be prioritised to facilitate the evaluation of RSV interventions and decision making.",

The incidence of RSV infection is lower in the first weeks of life, possibly because of protection from transferred maternal antibodies in newborns, and peaks in infants up to 3 months of age [4] . By the end of the second year of life, most children have had an RSV infection [1] . A recent review of the global RSV burden estimated 1.4 million (uncertainty range [UR] 1.2\u22121.7) RSV hospitalisations and 27,300 (UR 20, 200) in-hospital deaths occurred in infants aged < 6 months in 2015. Hospital admissions in this group constituted 45% of global RSV hospitalisations in young children (aged 0-4 years), which were estimated at 3.2 million (UR 2.7-3.8) in 2015. The estimates showed that the incidence of RSV-ALRI in those aged 0-5 months was higher in low-income (117.2 per 1000) than in highincome (66.1 per 1000) regions. In turn, hospital admission rates were reported to be much higher for high-income than for low-income countries. However, the small number of available studies limited the evidence on hospitalisations in low-income countries. The highest hospital admission rates",

The influential factors of acquisition of RSV in children include birth before and shortly after the onset of RSV season and attendance of childcare facilities [4] . Severe RSV illness and complications requiring hospitalisation occur mainly in high-risk children. Premature infants and children with severe respiratory disease, congenital heart disease, cancer, cystic fibrosis, immune deficiency, or Down syndrome have been reported to be at increased risk for severe RSV infection [6, 7] . Moreover, severe RSV disease during infancy presents a considerable risk for the development of recurrent wheezing and asthma later in life [8, 9] . Asymptomatic or mild RSV reinfections are common in adult life [10] , with more severe manifestation in immunocompromised individuals [11] , patients with cardiopulmonary diseases, and the elderly [12] . The increasing evidence on RSV in the elderly suggests that the impact of the disease is non-negligible, particularly in people with underlying comorbidities, and is comparable to that of non-pandemic influenza [12] [13] [14] .",

Currently, the only preventive strategy is passive immunisation since active immunisation is not yet available. Passive immunisation is attained by transferring antibodies to an unprotected individual [15] . In contrast, active immunisation or vaccination leads the individual's immune system to produce antibodies and build up cellular immunity [16] . While vaccination can induce a long-lasting immunity, passively induced immunity lasts for several weeks or months [15, 16] . The monoclonal antibody (mAb) palivizumab is used for RSV prevention but is usually restricted to infants with an underlying risk of severe RSV infection [1, 17] . No RSV vaccine has yet been licensed, but several vaccine candidates and mAbs are currently being tested in clinical trials [18] . Although vaccine effectiveness (VE) estimates are not yet available, decision-analytic models exploring the epidemiological and economic outcomes of potential RSV vaccination have been emerging. In this study, we summarised and critically appraised current evidence on the effectiveness and cost effectiveness of potential active vaccination strategies against RSV.",

The EVIDEM instrument evaluates (1) the quality of reporting in terms of completeness and consistency with cited sources and (2) the relevance and validity of evidence for decision making. We considered the EVIDEM instrument beneficial for the aims of this review because it provides an adaptable framework and allows a thorough assessment with the scoring of both the relevance of evidence and the completeness of the reporting of the model-based evaluations. We adopted the 'parameters and estimates' domain of EVIDEM to explore and evaluate the essential assumptions that directly govern the outcomes of the modelling of RSV transmission, the effects and the costs of the interventions, and that are therefore critical for comparing the studies and interpreting the results. Studies that estimated only epidemiological effects of RSV vaccination (hereinafter epidemiological evaluation studies) were also subjected to the quality assessment of the applied methods. For these studies, we considered the absence of cost estimates as a limiting factor but not something that affected their relevance for decision making. Two evaluators (MT, FPM) independently completed the quality assessment across the 11 dimensions and assigned a score for each study, providing a rationale for the given score (1, 2 for low and 3, 4 for high completeness of reporting and relevance/validity).",

VE was implemented as reduced susceptibility to RSV infection in the dynamic models and as a reduced proportion of hospitalisations or medically attended infections in the static models. Pan-Ngum et al. [37] and Kinyanjui et al. [33] considered a wide range of vaccine characteristics and modelled clinical endpoints in infants as a reduction in the risk of primary infection, the duration of infectivity, infectiousness, the risk of URTI, the risk of LRTI, and the risk of severe LRTI. Gessner [20] also explored possible VE against chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in the elderly. VE varied from 25 to 100% among the studies and vaccine types. The baseline parameter ranged from 60 to 80% for the maternal vaccine, from 70 to 80% for the elderly, and from 50 to 100% for infants and children. Uncertainty meant that most studies reported results over a wide range of possible VE values. For infant vaccination, 11 of 14 studies assumed 3-12 months of vaccine-induced immunity. Cromer et al. [32] set no waning over 5 years, van Boven et al. [31] assumed full protection until the age of 5 years, and Meijboom et al. [30] evaluated no waning, plateau, and linear waning over 10 years. Three studies [20, 24, 29] that evaluated vaccination in the elderly assumed that immunity lasted for one RSV season. Immunity in newborns due to maternal vaccination varied between 3 and 8 months. Additionally, Pan-Ngum et al. [37] and Kinyanjui et al. [33] considered potential interactions between vaccine-induced immunity and natural immunity due to maternal antibodies and modelled the effects of infant vaccine given in the presence of maternal antibodies that wane over time.",

            "text": "Most incidence estimates represent infected individuals who seek healthcare. Eleven studies graphically illustrated monthly or weekly series of RSV cases (hospitalisations) Optimal target product profile over the studied years in the modelled population. The approaches to estimating incidence among children were based on linkage of laboratory data to available administrative data [31, 32, 34] , data from the hospital reporting system [3, 27, 33, [36] [37] [38] , and observational studies [20, 21, 23, [28] [29] [30] 35] . Two studies that evaluated the intervention in Gavi-eligible countries obtained the data from a recent review [5] , estimated the total burden of the disease for each of the countries, and used statistical modelling to address the lack of granularity in the data [39, 40] . Additionally, the dynamic models used a scaling factor that translated medically attended RSV infection identified in the surveillance systems to the infections in the model. Table 3 presents the reported RSV incidence estimates without intervention and the resulting incidence reduction. The differences in reporting and the modelled age groups made it challenging to compare the incidence estimates across the studies. The studies that evaluated the protection of infants showed that RSV incidence was high in the first 5 months of life and peaked in infants from 1 to 3 months of age. The studies that included medically attended RSV infections reported that the proportion of cases treated in outpatient care was substantial. Three studies that considered vaccination in the elderly did not represent the age-specific incidence of RSV sufficiently to provide a summary. Meijboom et al. [29] reported that the hospitalisation numbers increased with age and health risk and were highest in the elderly aged \u2265 85 years.",

[30] reported maximum total vaccination costs per individual. Li et al. [40] performed a comprehensive comparative analysis of the cost effectiveness of maternal and infant interventions for 72 Gavi-eligible countries, defining an optimal strategy for a range of willingness-to-pay (WTP) values for each country. Six cost-effectiveness analyses used QALYs gained due to intervention: two in the elderly [20, 29] and four in children [23, 29, 32, 35] . In children, Cromer et al. [32] and Meijboom et al. [30] set QALY loss for an RSV disease based on healthcare services: general practitioner (GP)treated RSV (0.01), hospitalisation (0.04), and admission to an intensive care unit or chronic respiratory morbidity (0.08). Meijboom et al. [30] obtained these values from the study by The Dutch National Institute for Public Health and the Environment, which assigned QALY decrements of 0.01 to bronchi(oli)tis, 0.04 to pneumonia, and 0.08 to asthma. Pouwels et al. [35] set the disutility for a GP-treated RSV infection at 0.16 and for a hospital-treated RSV infection at 0.43 per day, with an average duration of infection of 14 days. The authors referred to a Canadian study that derived health states for RSV in children and adults using time tradeoff and best-worst scales [42] . R\u00e9gnier et al. [23] estimated a QALY loss per RSV hospitalisation of 0.01 and a QALY loss of 0.005 and 0.008 for mild and severe cough (duration 10 days), respectively. The authors obtained the values from a study that estimated health states for pertussis infections [43] . For the elderly, Gessner [20] and Meijboom et al. [29] reported utilities that the patients experience during RSV treated in outpatient care (0.46 per day for 1 week) and inpatient care (0.35 per day for 3 weeks).",

Four studies [21, [25] [26] [27] , which were more methodological papers than evaluations, were given a lower score for relevancy for decision making. Overall, the studies that included a dynamic-transmission model, examined uncertainty surrounding VE, and evaluated a wide range of vaccination scenarios were scored more highly. The final EVIDEM forms with comments and scores are available in ESM 2. Figure 3 presents the studies evaluated, categorising them by target group, type of analysis, and relevance for decision making. Table 3 presents the estimated reduction of RSV burden and the study conclusions. No clinical evaluation of VE and duration of vaccine-induced immunity is yet available, so all reported estimates of reduction of the RSV disease burden should be considered as potential and theoretical. The absolute and relative potential reductions in the number of hospitalisations were the most frequently used epidemiological outcomes reported in the selected studies. Figure 4 illustrates the reported percentage reduction in the outcomes relative to the 'no vaccination' scenario. Table 4 presents the results of economic analyses. In the following sections, we summarise the results of the studies with EVIDEM scores of 3 or 4, indicating higher relevance for decision making.",

[34] simulated the potential effects of a wide range of scenarios of maternal vaccination, varying the VE and duration of vaccine-induced immunity on RSV hospitalisations in infants aged 0-2 and 3-5 months. The percentage reduction in hospitalisations ranged from 6 to 51% and was higher for infants aged 3-5 months. The authors reported a 26% reduction in those aged 0-2 months and a 40% reduction in those aged 3-5 months for the scenario defined by 80% VE, 50% vaccine uptake, and 6-months of vaccine-induced immunity. The scenario with higher effectiveness (90%) and coverage (70%) resulted in the most substantial estimated reduction in hospitalisations, of 51% in children aged < 3 months and 63% in those aged 3-5 months. Lower VE and coverage resulted in 10 and 21% reductions in hospitalisations in these groups, respectively. A reduced duration of vaccine-induced immunity of 3 months did not bring additional beneficial health outcomes in infants aged > 3 months. Additionally, the authors pointed out that the impact of maternal vaccination in children aged > 6 months (given that the maximum duration of vaccineinduced immunity was 6 months) was negligible, indicating a small herd effect. The results of van Boven et al. [31] from The Netherlands support the inference of Hogan et al. [34] about the negligible indirect benefits of maternal vaccination in groups other than infants. The study reported a potential 27% decrease in the infection attack rate as a result of vaccinating 50% of pregnant women with a 50% effective vaccine and assumed duration of protection of 6 months.",

Increasing the household coverage up to 100% would induce an additional reduction of 5% in RSV hospitalisations. Among the other two studies based on the data from Kenya, Pan-Ngum et al. [37] showed that the majority of modelled vaccination profiles with a maximum duration of protection of 6 months resulted in a 7-15% reduction in hospitalisations in children aged < 5 years. Poletti et al. [3] modelled the effect of maternal vaccination as an increase of duration of natural immunity in newborns derived from maternal antibodies. Vaccination was assumed to prolong the 4 months of natural maternal protection up to 5, 6, and 8 months. Assuming 8 months of immunity in 100% of protected newborns in the modelled cohort, the authors predicted a 31.5% potential reduction in RSV infant infections. Using a static model without herd effects in the USA, Rainisch et al. [22] evaluated the introduction of maternal vaccination in addition to within-season passive immunisation of high-risk infants with palivizumab as one of three strategies. The base-case scenario was defined as 80% VE, 56% vaccine uptake, and 90 days of vaccine-induced immunity for maternal vaccination and 51% effectiveness, 38% coverage, and 150 days of protection for palivizumab. Compared with no intervention, this scenario resulted in a 14% reduction in RSV-associated LRTIs attended in outpatient clinics, a 13% reduction in emergency department visits, and a 25% reduction in hospital admissions.",

[35] in Turkey, a 17% reduction in infant hospitalisations was estimated due to maternal vaccination assuming 60% VE, 85% vaccine coverage, and 8 months of protection. The estimated cost effectiveness of this strategy was $US57,195 PPP 2018 per QALY gained. Cromer et al. [32] estimated an 80% potential reduction in outpatient-attended RSV infections in England, averting around 1.5 RSV-attributable hospital admissions per 100 births and implying a 43% QALY gain. They showed that maternal vaccination with 70% effectiveness and 3 months of protection could be cost effective if the price of the vaccine was set at $US81.5 PPP 2018 or lower. Two static-model-based evaluations explored the effects of maternal vaccination in Gavi-eligible countries. The structure of the models, underlying incidence data, and assumed vaccine-related parameters were similar between the studies. Li et al. [40] reported the results for 2022 for 72 countries and projected the potential prevention of 1.2 million RSV cases, 104,000 RSV hospitalisations, 3000 deaths, and 98,000 DALYs (3% discounted) for maternal vaccination (VE of 70% and 5 months of protection). Further, between 2023 and 2035, Baral et al. [39] projected a potential reduction of, on average, 11.3 million cases, more than 3.4 million RSV hospitalisations, 150,000 deaths, and 10.3 DALYs (not discounted) reached through maternal vaccination (VE of 60% and 5 months of protection) with increased coverage in 73 Gavi-supported countries. The economic evaluation by Li et al. [40] provided an estimation of cost-effectiveness ratios ($US/DALY averted) compared with no intervention for each country. For a vaccine price of $US3.10 PPP 2018, the reported estimates vary from $US1766 PPP 2018 per DALY for Angola to $US5857 PPP 2018 per DALY for Vietnam. The study shows that, if the WTP value is more than $US1000 per DALY averted, a change from the current situation to the introduction of maternal vaccination could be optimal.",

Three [3, 36, 37] of them conducted dynamic modelling of routine infant immunisation based on Kenyan hospital data and, as such, incorporated herd immunity. Poletti et al. [3] estimated that routine vaccination of all infants aged 3 months with a vaccine providing full protection over 6 months led to a 41.5% decrease in RSV primary infections in infants (see Fig. 4 ). Pan-Ngum et al. [37] reported a median reduction of \u2265 50% RSV-associated hospitalisations within a year if 90% of infants were vaccinated at 2 and 4 months of age. Kinyanjui et al. [36] investigated the optimal age to vaccinate children aged < 1 year, aiming to increase reductions in RSV hospitalisations. Over 60% of hospitalisations were averted with 70% vaccination coverage at 6 months of age. The most considerable reduction (80%) was achieved when infants were vaccinated at 10 months, and the smallest effect (40% reduction) was obtained with a vaccine administered at 5 months.",

[39] highlighted the essential gaps in data on RSVattributable hospitalisation and mortality rates and called for better evidence on RSV incidence and on the disease burden for fine age strata. Other modelling studies that explore interventions in low-income settings used only the data from surveillance of children admitted to the Kilifi district hospital. In high-income settings, the researchers addressed the lack of data either by obtaining the data from observational studies or inferring the incidence and hospitalisation rates using data from different sources, such as administrative and laboratory data. It is important to note that only three studies in our review, all conducted in high-income settings, considered targeting the elderly for vaccination. Given the changing demographic structure in high-income countries and increasing evidence of the substantial impact of RSV in the elderly, further projections of the potential direct and indirect effects of prevention strategies are necessary. To facilitate model-based evaluations of prevention strategies, further estimates of the disease burden in the elderly, including quality-of-life impairment, are needed, especially across health risk groups and in both nursing homes and the community. Overall, there is a need for epidemiological research on RSV transmission, especially within households, age-and period-stratified RSV incidence, hospitalisation rates, inhospital mortality, and reinfection rates in different settings. With regard to the latter, the dynamic-transmission models assume decreasing susceptibility with increasing age and levels of exposure. However, the current state of knowledge does not allow separation of the two effects within a model, and further epidemiological evidence is needed.",

The most commonly used assumption was that immunity lasted over one season or for the same period as natural immunity. Other assumptions included long-lasting immunity with or without waning. These assumptions influence the effects of maternal vaccination and the optimal age of infant vaccination. The optimal age of vaccination could not be determined in this review.

Yamin et al. [24] showed that infected children aged < 5 years transmitted the infection to more than one individual. Infected older individuals, on the other hand, were less responsible for transmission than any other age group. Therefore, the models that applied restricted age structures likely underestimated the potential vaccination impact at the population level. In contrast, given the suggested small herd effect of maternal vaccination, the application of a limited age structure in modelling this intervention could be sufficient to estimate the vaccination impact. A more detailed social structure allowed modelling of more targeted vaccination scenarios. In Kenya, Poletti et al. [3] found that infant infections were caused by transmission within a household when infants cohabitated with one or more older siblings aged < 13 years. In these households, the school-age children were mainly responsible for introducing the infection and causing about half of the household outbreaks. Overall, vaccination of school-aged children and maternal vaccination, which can induce passive protection for 8 months, represented effective strategies when direct vaccination of newborns and infants was not achievable. Compared with the maternal vaccination in Poletti et al. [3] and using the data from the same source, Brand et al. [38] illustrated that additional reductions in hospitalisation of infants could be potentially achieved through a cocooning strategy, i.e. vaccinating pregnant women and the members of their households. None of the studies in our review explored RSV transmission within households in highincome settings.",

Although WTP values differ considerably between high-and low-income countries, a similar pattern can be seen in the results by Cromer et al. [32] for England. The study reported a lower maximum costeffective price for maternal vaccination than for passive or active infant immunisation.
