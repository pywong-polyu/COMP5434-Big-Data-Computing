[1] [2] [3] Both physical and psychological well-being were severely afflicted by this pandemic and its mitigation measures. 4 As of 20 April 2021, the direct biological harm caused by the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in more than 141 million patients, and the death toll surpassed three million deaths globally. 5 Worldwide, the various impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic could not pass by without affecting the psychological status of people. The fear of infection itself, the lack of effective antiviral therapy and the lack of vaccines at an earlier stage of the pandemic can result in intense emotional and psychological responses. 4 6-9 In addition, these psychological and behavioural changes may result indirectly from the confinement and control measures such as lockdown, quarantine, stay-at-home orders and physical distancing rules. 8 10 The psychological impacts of such a global pandemic have afflicted different countries and populations around the world. [11] [12] [13] The pandemic-induced distress can also affect people regardless of their socioeconomic status, gender or even their psychiatric history. Different societal components including the general population, students, healthcare professionals, academicians, people with a previous psychiatric history and even those who have never experienced any psychological issues, could have been impacted by a large-scale crisis such as the COVID-19 pandemic. 8 11 13-22 Therefore, people in Arab countries were not excluded Strengths and limitations of this study \u25ba The final COVID-19 Psychological Distress Scale (CPDS) comprised 12 items to assess COVID-19induced psychological distress. \u25ba The 12-item CPDS has been validated on a sample from four Arab countries. \u25ba Robust statistical tests were used to psychometrically validate the 12-item CPDS. \u25ba The online survey and convenience sampling may limit the generalisation of our results. \u25ba Further studies may assess the clinical utility of the 12-item CPDS in various settings and populations.",

Besides, addressing the psychological effects of infectious diseases outbreaks can be challenging at early stages, when most efforts and services are intended to protect physical well-being and less attention is paid to the psychological side. 23 The scientific community has been working eagerly to develop different psychological assessment tools specified for the COVID-19-related distress. Among the recently developed instruments were: The Coronavirus Anxiety Scale, the Fear of COVID-10 Scale, the Obsession with COVID-19 Scale, COVID-19 Stress Scale and the Questionnaire on Perception of Threat from COVID-19. [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] To the best of our knowledge, none of these scales have been evaluated for measurement invariance or differential item functioning (DIF) across Arab countries. Measurement invariance is a crucial issue, primarily when tools are used for diagnoses and selection purposes. 29 DIF detection procedures are important methodological procedures for a better understanding of the underlying constructs that are measured by items on an educational or psychological test. 30 The main objectives of our present research study were (1) To develop a psychometrically reliable tool, namely, the COVID-19 Psychological Distress Scale (CPDS), that can be used in assessing the predisposition to develop COVID-19-induced psychological distress in Arab countries and (2) To test the measurement invariance of the newly developed tool across country and gender, as well as to assess the CPDS items fairness using DIF analyses.",

The referees were requested to review all items to determine the appropriate items for accurate measurement of COVID-19-induced distress. The referees classified the statements as acceptable or unacceptable. If 3 out of the 10 referees classified an item as unacceptable, that item was removed from the initial version of the CPDS. Also, the referees had to determine the adequacy of phrasing and clarity of meaning. As a result, specific revisions and corrections were carried out accordingly. Finally, 18 items were agreed on to be excluded, which resulted in the final version of our newly developed tool: the 12-Item CPDS.

DWLS provides more accurate parameter estimates, and the fit of the model is more robust to variable type and non-normality. 37 Moreover, several fit indices were used to examine whether the data fit well with the CFA or multigroup CFA using the factor structural initially found using the EFA. The fit statistics included Comparative Fit Index (CFI), Root Mean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA) and Standardised Root Mean Square Residual (SRMR). Values of CFI >0.95, together with those of RMSEA <0.06 and SRMR <0.08, indicate a satisfactory fit. 38 39 The multigroup CFA further examined whether measurement invariance was supported across the country and/or across gender. Three nested models were constructed in the multigroup CFA: (1) a configural model; (2) a model with factor loadings constrained equal across subsamples (ie, either country subsamples or gender subsamples) and (3) a model with factor loadings and item intercepts constrained equal across subsamples. 40 Then, the three nested models were compared with assess the level of measurement invariance across country and gender. When comparing two hierarchically constrained models (eg, configural invariance model vs equal-loadings invariance model), the measurement invariance is achieved when \u2206CFI, \u2206RMSEA and \u2206SRMR are less than (0.02). 41 Finally, Rasch analysis was used to assess the psychometric properties of the CPDS measure and to evaluate DIF for each item. Two partial credit models (one for each subfactor) were used to examine (1) the separation reliability and separation index of the CPDS; (2) how the CPDS items fit in their embedded factors and (3) whether any of the CPDS items have substantial DIF across the country or gender. Separation reliability greater than 0.7, and a separation index greater than 2.0 were used as criteria to indicate satisfactory properties for the CPDS. 42 Information-weighted mean square (infit MnSq) and outlier-sensitive MnSq (outfit MnSq) between 0.5 and 1.5 are proposed to indicate a good fit of an item in its embedded factor. 43 Moreover, an item was flagged as having substantial DIF if the absolute value of the DIF contrast statistics was larger than (0.5). 40 The EFA and PA were executed using 'psych' package in the R software, 44 CFA and multigroup CFA using 'lavaan' package in the R software, 45 while Rasch analysis and DIF using WINSTEPS V.3.75.0 (Winsteps, Chicago, Illinois, USA).",

The CPDS is considered the first designed Arabic measure of COVID-19-related psychopathology and was validated on medium, appropriately sized samples from four Arabic countries, reflecting diverse cultures. Two clear-cut psychometrically sound factors were found that reflect the physiological and emotional symptoms of the COVID-19 distress. These factors showed evidence of stability when tested against an independent sample using CFA. Importantly, the two-factor structure was found to be invariant across gender and country. Thus, the CPDS is applicable in most Arab cultures, and the derived scores can be validly compared without the need for specific gender adjustments.",

This result provided evidence that the physical condition and emotional state of anxiety for healthy participants are interrelated. Because negative changes in emotional valence influence pain and fatigue symptoms of anxiety, one might expect that positive changes in emotional valence may be associated with improvements in the physical condition.

Also, due to the pandemic crisis, random sampling or stratified sampling was not feasible.
