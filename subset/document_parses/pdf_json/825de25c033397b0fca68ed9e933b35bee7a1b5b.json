            "text": "Smartphones can improve our lives, but also consume our lives. It is known that problematic mobile phone use, such as nomophobia, can lead to some mental health problems. So far, psychological factors behind nomophobia were yet to be fully discovered. Previous studies showed that individuals' adaptability was closely related to nomophobia. However, adaptability was a complex construct that contains various components, and it was unclear whether these components contributed equally to nomophobia. This study investigated 678 college students by using Chinese versions of the nomophobia questionnaire, mobile phone addiction tendency scale, and freshmen adaptability scale. Lasso regression was used to further explore the key factors that could affect nomophobia. Model results showed that the value of \u03bb+1se was [0.303, 0.423] at the minimum mean squared error in the training data. Emotional adaptability significantly predicted the fear of being unable to access information (\u03b2 = \u22120.022, p < 0.001), losing convenience (\u03b2 = \u22120.067, p < 0.001), and losing Internet connection (\u03b2 = \u22120.003, p < 0.01) after \u03bb+1se was included in the testing data, and the R 2 were 0.496, 0.483, and 0.493. Homesickness adaptability significantly predicted the fear of losing contact (\u03b2 = \u22120.056, p < 0.05), and R 2 was 0.508. In addition, similar results were obtained by using datasets of mobile phone addiction and adaptability. Therefore, we concluded that the emotional adaptability has an important effect on nomophobia. Additionally, we also found that homesickness adaptability has an important role in predicting fear of losing contact.",

I-PACE proposed that many factors could affect mobile phone overuse (e.g., mobile phone addiction and nomophobia), including biological factors (e.g., gender), personality factors, and psychological factors (e.g., adaptability). The present study, therefore, was carried out to examine the extent to which adaptability affected nomophobia by establishing the I-PACE model.",

At first, the sample was divided into two halves by using function of sample randomly, one-half as a training dataset (n = 336) and the other as a testing dataset (n = 337). Next, training data were conducted to get the best \u03bb by using the cross-validation approach, and then the best \u03bb was taken into the testing data to get the final Lasso regression by using glmnet packages. Finally, the covTest package was used to test the significance of coefficients in Lasso regression. Table 1 shows the descriptive statistics of nomophobia and adaptability among our participants. Results showed that fear of being unable to access information showed a mean (M) emotional adaptability showed M = 3.987, SD = 1.005, and economical adaptability showed M = 4.157, SD = 1.020. Pearson correlation matrix was conducted to analyze the correlations between variables. Bivariate correlations for summed scores were reported in Figure 1 . There were significant correlations between homesickness adaptability and fear of being unable to access information (r = \u22120.123, p < 0.01), losing convenience (r = \u22120.152, p < 0.001), losing contact (r = \u22120.274, p < 0.001), and losing Internet connection (r = \u22120.168, p < 0.001). Results also showed that emotional adaptability negatively associated with being unable to access information (r = \u22120.267, p < 0.001), losing convenience (r = \u22120.253, p < 0.001), losing contact (r = \u22120.172, p < 0.001), and losing Internet connection (r = \u22120.254, p < 0.001). Besides that, learning adaptability and economical adaptability were negatively related to fear of being unable to access information (r = \u22120.146, p < 0.001; r = \u22120.094, p < 0.05), losing convenience (r = \u22120.136, p < 0.001; r = \u22120.111, p < 0.01), and losing Internet connection (r = \u22120.140, p < 0.001; r = \u22120.190, p < 0.001). Meanwhile, professional adaptability and interpersonal adaptability were related to the level of fear of being unable to access information (r = \u22120.132, p < 0.01; r = \u22120.191, p < 0.05) and losing Internet connection (r = \u22120.130, p < 0.01; r = \u22120.110 p < 0.01).

Our results supported this hypothesis and were consistent with the conclusion of previous studies (28) . In sum, individuals' emotional cognition (adaptability in our study) resulted in some problematic behaviors related to smartphones (nomophobia and mobile phone addiction in this study) (43) .",

We just had found the factors that could affect nomophobia, but did not put forward effective measures to improve individuals' adaptability, because we just conducted a survey for the relationship between them. Therefore, we hope to solve this problem by an interventional study in the future. Besides, the relationship between adaptability and nomophobia was a cross-sectional study in this study. However, adaptability is a state variable to some extent. The results will be more persuasive if a longitudinal study is conducted. Therefore, a longitudinal design together with cross-lagged regression analysis is a good choice to verify the conclusions from this study.",

At first, it provided compelling evidence for the assumption of the I-PACE model by using empirical data, which confirmed that individuals' adaptability (psychological factors) could predict nomophobia significantly. Next, previous studies treated adaptability or nomophobia as a simple component (11, 13, 26) , when the distinct dimensions of those two psychological traits were clarified. Furthermore, the specific relationships between different dimensions of adaptability and different dimensions of mobile phone overuse (mobile phone addiction and nomophobia) were examined. The key factors, such as emotional adaptability and homesickness adaptability, that affected nomophobia were discovered. Therefore, we further explained why individuals have various manifestations of nomophobia. Thirdly, this study also confirmed that the mobile phones bring both positive and negative effects on the participant. On the one hand, this study found that there were significant associations between mobile phone overuses with emotional adaptability and homesickness adaptability. On the other hand, for some college students, they could get in touch with their family through mobile phones when they suffer from homesickness maladjustment. It indicated that decreasing PUPM could be complex in practice.",

Homesickness adaptability was an important factor that can affect the fear of losing contact in nomophobia. That is to say, individuals' level of emotional adaptability and homesickness adaptability are important adaptability traits for predicting nomophobia. Individuals would exhibit the fear of being unable to get information, losing convenience, and losing Internet connection in nomophobia if they have some performance about emotional maladjustment. Additionally, they would exhibit the fear of losing contact in nomophobia if they have some performance about homesickness maladjustment.",
