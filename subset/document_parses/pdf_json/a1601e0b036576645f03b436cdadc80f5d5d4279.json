We aimed to investigate if cfDNA level can serve in stratification of COVID-19 patients, and if cfDNA level is associated with alterations in lymphocyte subsets and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR). This cross-sectional comparative study enrolled 64 SARS-CoV-2-positive patients. Patients were subdivided to severe and non-severe groups. Plasma cfDNA concentration was determined by real-time quantitative PCR. Lymphocyte subsets were assessed by flow cytometry. There was significant increase in cfDNA among severe cases when compared with non-severe cases. cfDNA showed positive correlation with NLR and inverse correlation with T cell percentage. cfDNA positively correlated with ferritin and C-reactive protein. The output data of performed ROC curves to differentiate severe from non-severe cases revealed that cfDNA at cut-off !17.31 ng/ml and AUC of 0.96 yielded (93%) sensitivity and (73%) specificity. In summary, excessive release of cfDNA can serve as sensitive COVID-19 severity predictor. There is an association between cfDNA up-regulation and NLR up-regulation and T cell percentage down-regulation. cfDNA level can be used in stratification and personalized monitoring strategies in COVID-19 patients.",

Accumulation of cfDNA in plasma may be the result of excess release from massive cell destruction, insufficient elimination of dead cells, extracellular DNA traps formed during inflammation, or a combination of all these causes. 2 The cfDNA is detected in plasma and other body fluids. Release of cfDNA into the circulation is likely due to cellular breakdown mechanisms, such as apoptosis and necrosis, as well as active DNA-release mechanisms. 3 In the context of many pathological conditions, cfDNA is an excellent biomarker candidate for clinical application, mainly circulating cell-free mitochondrial DNA. 4 Leukocytes are a major source of cfDNA which is produced from apoptotic and dying cells in COVID-19 patients and can be brought up by dying lymphocytes. More than 60% of patients with COVID-19 had lymphopenia, which can produce abundant free DNA in these patients. 5 Phagocytic cells usually remove apoptotic debris, decreasing the consequences of the presence of dead cell materials. 6 In a state of disease, when cell death exceeds the clearance capacity, this phagocytic system is overwhelmed. 7 Previous data suggested a link between the level of inflammation and the amount of cfDNA released from damaged cells in the circulation, which gives a potentiality of cfDNA in determination of COVID-19 severity.",

The majority of patients were females (56.3%), 50% were asymptomatic, 15.6% had fever, 20.3% had cough, 4.7% had fever with cough, 6.3% had diarrhoea, and 3.1% had fever with diarrhoea. By the end of the study only two patients (3.1%) required mechanical ventilation and died. Ten patients (15.5%) were on continuous positive airway pressure therapy, while all other severe patients were on high flow nasal cannula or venturi. The median duration between first symptoms and hospital admission in severe cases was 4.5 d. Hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and bronchial asthma were the most reported co-morbidities in 34.4%, 26.6%, and 14.1%, respectively. Comparative data between severe and non-severe cases are shown in Table 1 . The correlation study of cfDNA with other parameters showed significant positive correlations with CRP, ferritin, total leukocyte count (TLC), absolute neutrophil count (ANC), B cells (%) and NLR. Significant negative correlations were also found with absolute lymphocyte count (ALC), platelets, T cells (%), NK (%) and TNK (%) ( Table 2 ). The comparison of mean values of cfDNA in severe and non-severe groups showed significantly higher values in severe cases than in non-severe cases (P < 0.001) (Figure 2 ). On comparing alteration of lymphocytes in severe and non-severe groups, we found that the frequency of circulating T lymphocytes was significantly decreased in severe cases compared with non-severe cases (P < 0.001) and the frequency of B cells was significantly higher in severe cases than in non-severe cases (P < 0.001) (Figure 3) .",

This was in line with Zuo et al., who reported that cfDNA was higher in hospitalized patients receiving mechanical ventilation as compared with hospitalized patients breathing room air. 14 This can be explained by cfDNA that can be released to the circulation as a result of inflammatory process, 2 either due to cellular breakdown mechanisms, as apoptosis, or due to active DNA-release mechanisms by neutrophils. 3 cfDNA can also be a reason for amplification of the inflammatory process. Liu et al. reported that cfDNA can produce severe inflammation mediated by C-type lectin receptors encoded within the NK complex family, MHC class I genes, and type I interferons, and some DNA sensors, and those inflammations will end with cytokine storm. 6 Similarly, Wu et al. reported that cfDNA can circulate and activate different immune cells to produce a huge amount of cytokines, leading to cytokine storm. 15 cfDNA was also reported to destroy vascular endothelial cells directly, which will add to the dysfunctions of multiple organs by cytokine storm. 16 The present study revealed a significant increase in CRP in severe cases when compared with non-severe cases, with a median of 29.5 in severe cases and a median value in non-severe cases of 1.5 (P < 0.001). This was in line with Ali and Chen et al., who reported that patients with severe disease courses had a far elevated level of CRP than non-severe patients. 17, 18 Wang et al. proposed CRP as a predictive marker for the aggravation of non-severe COVID-19 patients, with an optimal threshold value of 26.9 mg/l. 19 Huang et al. reported that CRP can also be used to monitor disease improvement beside being used as prognostic marker in COVID-19. 20 There was a significant hyperferritinemia (P < 0.001) in severe cases when compared with non-severe cases, which was in agreement with Chen et al. 21 In a metaanalysis performed by Taneri et al. based on combined estimates from 29 studies and 13,620 individuals, serum ferritin was higher in severe COVID-19 individuals compared with moderate cases. 22 Daher et al. reported that hyperferritinemia is linked to systemic level of inflammation, as during the inflammatory state IL-6 stimulates ferritin and hepcidin synthesis. 23 Kernan and Carcillo claimed that ferritin is a direct mediator of the immune system, and reported a feedback mechanism between ferritin and cytokines, as cytokines can induce ferritin expression, and ferritin can induce the expression of pro-and antiinflammatory cytokines, as well. 24 On top of that, G omez-Pastora et al. added that ferritin is a mediator for the inflammatory process, stimulating inflammatory pathways, which will initiate a vicious pathogenic immune loop. 25 The current study revealed a significant increase in TLC and ANC (P \u00bc 0.002 and (P < 0.001, respectively) in severe cases, while there was a significant decrease in ALC in severe cases (P < 0.001). This was in agreement with Chen et al. and Henry et al., who reported that patients with severe COVID-19 had significantly increased TLC, ANC and decreased lymphocyte compared with non-severe disease. 21, 26 A comparison of platelet count showed a non-significant difference between severe cases and non-severe cases (P \u00bc 0.07); this was in disagreement with Henry et al. 26 and Zhao et al., 27 who reported that early decrease in blood platelet count is associated with poor prognosis.",

            "text": "The NLR was significantly higher in severe cases (P < 0.001). This was in line with Liu et al., who further added that NLR was an independent risk factor of the in-hospital mortality for COVID-19 patients. 28 A meta-analysis performed by Lagunas-Rangel stated that increased NLR levels reflect an enhanced inflammatory process which suggests poor prognosis. 29 This increase in NLR may be due to increased ANC in severe cases, as neutrophils get activated and migrate from the venous system to the immune system. Neutrophils release large amounts of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that can free the virus from the cells. Thus, Ab-dependent cell-mediated cytotocicity (ADCC) may kill the virus directly, expose virus Ag, and stimulate cell-specific and humoral immunities. 30 Neutrophils can also be triggered by virus-related inflammatory factors, such as IL-6 and IL-8, TNF-a and IFN-c factors, produced by lymphocytes. The human immune response triggered by viral infection mainly relies on lymphocytes, whereas systematic inflammation significantly decreases T lymphocytes. Thus, virus-triggered inflammation increased NLR. 8 There was a significant decrease, in severe cases, in circulating T lymphocytes, TNK and NK cells (P < 0.001), P \u00bc 0.04, and P < 0.01, respectively), while the frequency of B cells was significantly higher in severe cases than in non-severe cases (P < 0.001). This was in line with Chen et al. 21 Qin et al. reported that the number of T cells decreased in severe cases of COVID-19. The increase in the frequency of B cells could be due to the more significant decrease in T lymphocytes in severe cases, as well. 31 He et al. reported that all lymphocyte subsets, including T-, Band NK cells, were significantly lower in the severe group, but emphasized that only T-lymphocyte count correlated with the disease course of patients in COVID-19 pneumonia. 32 Wang et al. also reported that peripheral lymphocyte subset alteration was associated with clinical characteristics of COVID-19. 33 There was a significant decrease of haemoglobin (Hb) in severe cases (P < 0.001), which could be explained by the fact that angiotensin II regulates normal erythropoiesis and stimulates early erythroid proliferation. Binding of SARS-CoV-2 to the host ACE2 increases dysregulation of erythropoiesis through the downstream angiotensin II pathway. 34 Cheng et al. also reported that there was an increased erythroid turnover in COVID-19 patients and that a portion of plasma cfDNA was derived from destruction of erythroid cells. They added that possible causes of anaemia in COVID-19 patients included: (a) excessive inflammation and cytokine storm, (b) haemophagocytosis in relation to inflammation, and (c) consumption in microthrombi. 18 Correlation studies revealed that the cfDNA positively correlated with inflammatory marker CRP (r \u00bc 0.577; P < 0.001), which highlights the role of cfDNA in the inflammatory state. Endothelial cell inflammation is documented in patients with COVID-19. Rauch et al.'s study revealed the presence of vascular inflammation and severe endothelial injury as a direct consequence of SARS-CoV-2 infection and ensuing host inflammatory response in COVID-19. 35 Ng et al., in addition, reported that levels of the neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) contributing to circulating cfDNA formation correlated with CRP as well. 36 The cfDNA positively correlated with ferritin (r \u00bc 0.58; P < 0.001). This could be explained by excess intracellular iron interacting with molecular oxygen, generating ROS which contributes to oxidative damage of cellular components of different organs and apoptosis which is a source of cfDNA. Programmed cell death mediated by iron-dependent peroxidation mechanisms in inflammatory pathologies is called ferroptosis. 37 On top of that, it was documented that hyperferritinemia was linked to coagulopathy, as oxidized iron accelerates serum coagulation by interacting with proteins of the coagulation cascade. 38 Our study showed weak correlation of cfDNA with TLC, while a moderate positive correlation was seen with ANC (r \u00bc 0.276, P < 0.05) and ANC (r \u00bc 0.482; P < 0.001). This was in line with Ng et al., who stated that NET markers which are cfDNA, citrullinated histone H3, and neutrophil elastase correlated with TLC and neutrophils. 36 During the inflammatory process there is activation of neutrophils and an increase in the production of NETs, which are microbicidal proteins, and oxidant enzymes, those released by neutrophils to contain infections. 2 The NLR at cut-off of ! 3.1 and AUC of 0.98 yielded a sensitivity of 91% while specificity was 93% (P < 0001). (C) ALC at cut-off of !1.5 \u00c2 10 3 /mm 3 and AUC of 0.0.92 yielded 76% sensitivity with 93% specificity (P < 0.001) to differentiate severe from non-severe cases. cfDNA, cell-free DNA; NLR, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio; ALC, absolute lymphocyte count.",

Likewise, associated lymphopenia due to lymphocyte apoptosis contributes to more release of cfDNA. NLR was considered as an independent biomarker for indicating poor clinical outcomes by Yang et al. 8 There was a negative correlation of cfDNA with percentage of T cell (r \u00bc -0.438; P < 0.001) and NK (r \u00bc -0.317; P < 0.05), while no correlation was seen with TNK. Interestingly, there was a significant positive correlation with B cells (r \u00bc 0.556; P < 0.001). It is worth mentioning that He et al. claimed T cells as being an independent predictor for COVID-19 severity. The study revealed an inverse weak correlation of cfDNA with platelets (PLTs) (r \u00bc -0.279; P < 0.05). 32 This can be explained by the virtue of the fact that COVID-19 disease is characterized by hyper-inflammation and endothelial injury as a direct consequence of intracellular SARS-CoV-2 infection and ensuing host inflammatory response. Injury to endothelial cells thus contributes to the release of cfDNA, which then promotes coagulation leading to the widespread formation of microthrombi, provoking microcirculatory failure or large-vessel thrombosis leading to consumption of PLTs in thrombi. 35 The cfDNA at cut-off !17.31 ng/ ml and AUC of 0.96 yielded a specificity of 73% and sensitivity of 93% with P < 0.001 to differentiate severe from non-severe cases. The NLR at cut-off of !3.1 and AUC of 0.98 yielded a specificity of 93% and sensitivity of 91%, with P < 0.001; ALC at cut-off of !1.5 \u00c2 10 3 /mm 3 and AUC of 0.0.92 yielded the lowest sensitivity of 76% with specificity of 93% and P < 0.001, which indicates that cfDNA is the most sensitive among the studied markers in discriminating severity, proposing it as a monitoring marker and a target of therapy.",
