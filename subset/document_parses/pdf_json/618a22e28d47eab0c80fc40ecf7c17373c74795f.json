During the pandemic, communities have used this opportunity to support children's education in various ways, including the launching of new online classes. This article takes the social capital theoretical model as its framework and applies it to help communities strengthen their education support systems. It also looks at models from the literature as best practices to operationalize social capital. The article highlights various models for community participation that could continue after the Covid-19 pandemic. It urges the school system to be flexible and incorporate community-driven parental engagement with project-based and experiential learning. These community-driven educational programs must be supported to provide much-needed place-based supplementary education opportunities to students.",

The use of informal community networks in education has been an underrepresented area of research. Informal networks form a big part of social capital (Sampson et al. 1999 ). This \"neighborhood activism\" (p. 207) translates into household-level networks within the family, and informal horizontal relationships that include neighbors talking to each other, church members interacting, and school parents discussing soccer and other such interactions (Schneider et al. 2000) . Therefore, living in the same neighborhood provides incentives for people to be informally connected (Smrekar 1996) . These informal connections, or social networks, are a source of cheap and useful bits of information (Schneider et al. 2000; Smrekar 1996) . Parental exchanges without deep friendship can have an important effect on children's education (Schneider et al. 2000) . Children in these types of communities share common values and have some support system that their parents can tap into (Adams 2006) . In communities were more parents talk to each other, children benefit from added guidance and tend to have higher math scores (Adams 2006) . In these ways, collective socialization has proven to be a powerful tool to shape children's education.",

In a study based in Bogota, Knaul (1999) measured both family (numbers of hours spent with children, activities of engagement) and community social capital (gangs, drugs, measures of violence). The study reported that both family and community social capital had an impact on school dropout rates, controlling for household financial and human capital. In a similar study, Grootaert et al. (2002) investigated low school attendance in Burkina Faso and concluded that limited community participation in education was one of the main reasons for poor attendance. This study tapped into the concept of social capital through households, schools, and other non-formal settings and proposed the use of social capital to improve educational outcomes (attendance, in this case).",

            "text": "Social capital is dependent on the cultural and contextual setting. The kinds of networks families establish have a long-lasting impact on their children's education. Research has shown the impact on children's completion rates in inner-city neighborhoods (Ainsworth 2002; Ensminger et al. 1996) . This type of cultural capital also is labeled a \"neighborhood effect\" and acts a strong mediator for schooling-related indicators (Ainsworth 2002) . Gugerty and Kremer (2002) attempted to understand if development aid for schools has helped to build social capital in Kenya. They conducted an experiment that compared three interventions: only textbooks were provided for 2 years, grants were given to the school committees as a part of a block grant, and the aid was provided through a local women's group. Their study revealed that it is difficult to build social capital from external interventions; rather, interventions should be organically present in communities. Figure 1 shows the different areas where education can take place, and where the notion of social capital can be operationalized. Schools, communities, households, and nonformal spaces of education have social networks that are connected. These networks, both formal and informal, need to be tapped to make nonlinear education possible. Communities can support community library programs, expert-led professional seminars, open learning opportunities, and such community projects as gardening and services. This area also includes business owners, who can provide learn-play spaces. Educators in schools need to reflect on how to make education more holistic by incorporating classes on environmental education, disaster preparedness, health education, as well as mental well-being. PTAs need to help with students' learning. At the household level, parents can continue to support through life skills and activity-based learning. At the nonformal level, library programs, museums, zoos, and wildlife parks can continue to conduct online classes. These four quadrants form a seamless web of learning that can coexist, with the various areas complementing each other. ",

Volunteers or parental groups are involved in many forms of education in communities. The responsibilities of volunteers and communities vary from country to country. For instance, community volunteers organized remedial education classes in a rural district in India. Volunteers complemented the school curriculum by introducing an alternative curriculum (School for Life Curriculum) in Ghana. They also campaigned for the use of indigenous languages in New Zealand. Multiple countries have used community-based libraries to foster the reading habits of all children. Volunteers in Honduras used a peer-tutoring model with youth residing in communities. In all these forms, the essential role of the community education volunteer is to support the existing formal school system and not to replace it. The community volunteer conducts community-based education-related activities that serve as an incentive to increase school enrollment or provide remediation to improve primary and secondary school completion.",

One reason for this exclusion is parents' lack of confidence because they are not educated themselves; other reasons include parents being busy with their daily chores during school time, and parents feeling their responsibility toward the education of their children ends when the children are enrolled in school. On the school organization side, the PTAs and SBMCs become ineffective because prior capacity enhancement of the parents is needed to make these administrative bodies functional. In such cases, the parents are not involved in their children's education, and even if they want to be, they do not know how. Parent engagement is critical to demanding quality education from the schools. One way of making children's education more accessible to their parents is to bridge the divide between the community and the school. Often, these education initiatives succeed because of intensive efforts to mobilize communities, resources, and local professionals.",

However, thriving communitybased pilot programs are often highly dependent on local initiatives and commitment that are difficult to replicate on a large scale. It is also essential to keep in mind that community-based educational initiatives can take many forms. However, they are most often dependent on the community's needs and social capital. For instance, a community that has a large population of children out of school would need to focus on educational incentives (e.g., enrollment drives, school information sessions with parents) to bring those children to school. For communities with a large population of children lagging in literacy or numeracy skills, providing remedial education classes in the community, providing technical training assistance to government teachers on reading skills and numeracy, and community-based libraries would be appropriate interventions.",

In reimagining the post-Covid-19 world, educational spaces such as preschool centers run by the government or by cooperatives in the community will be needed to continue early childhood education.

In some cases, para-teachers are selected and recruited by community members, along with the school administration. This model helps to improve classroom teaching; however, the downside is that full-time teachers can become dependent on this temporary arrangement, or in some cases, give a lot of their teaching load to the parateachers (UNESCO 2005) .

Iyengar and Shin (2020) provided one such model that provided psychosocial support to students through an \"eco-ambassadors\" program during the pandemic. Daily check-in via Zoom calls to discuss environmental concerns also led to community building among like-minded people and developed a sense of community. Such informal conversations help to achieve educational goals-in this case, environmental educational goals-to build collaboration between students, and to create a sense of learning together. These informal communications will build psychosocial support and be vital for the post-Covid-19 world.",

The pandemic has taught us about empathy, care for each other, global citizenship, and care for the planet, and these value-driven educational models will be much needed in the post-Covid-19 world. Model 9 shows a pathway to continue these value-driven education systems; peer tutoring not only improves teaching and learning skills but also develops important competency areas, such as psychosocial skills.

Going forward, here are some steps that ought to be taken. First, community-based assessments need to be carried out to assess the type of devices the majority of residents in the community have. Educational materials need customization to whatever device is most commonly used. The assessment should include the number of devices, the primary person owning the device, and the availability of the Internet. Second, a mapping of all educational opportunities, both free and paid, is required for parents to have full information in their own towns. Third, small-group classes on storytelling, book clubs, book exchanges, and exchanges of gardening skills should continue. Fourth, to make community members feel more connected to their neighborhood, community-based action or activism needs to be promoted. Fifth, more peer-to-peer learning and senior students teaching younger students should take place. Sixth, parents should be given an educational role to play that is not limited to conducting extracurricular activities at school or fundraising exercises. A more comprehensive network of parents needs to be established based on their interests. Seventh, cross-pollination of ideas across schools needs to be promoted. This network would make the social capital of students wider and not just limited to one school. Frequent opportunities need to be created district wide. Student-led online and offline events could be organized. Eight, mapping of community-wide (environmental, social, and other) needs can align students to address those needs. For example, if plastic is an issue, student groups can organize to do community-based activism and run campaigns. Nine, not everything needs to be organized beforehand; many activities can be planned last minute, and the school system and parents should be flexible to incorporate these opportunities. Ten, this is an excellent opportunity to build experiential and place-based learning into the curriculum. Problem-based activities connected to the lives of students can be integrated as projects into the school curriculum.",
