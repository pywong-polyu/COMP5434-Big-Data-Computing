A representative face-to-face survey was conducted to assess mental health consequences in the general population and to identify mental health risk factors. In a representative German sample (N = 2,503), we assessed depression and anxiety symptoms by the PHQ-4 and loneliness by a validated item. An earlier survey (2018) which used the same methods and had comparable response rates served as comparison. Scores of depression and anxiety symptoms increased from an average of 0.89 (SD = 1.21) and 0.77 (SD = 1.17) in 2018 to 1.14 (SD = 1.23) and 1.05 (SD = 1.31) in 2020. Loneliness did not increase (M = 1.35, SD = 0.68 in 2018; M = 1.38, SD = 0.78 in 2020), affecting about one in four participants to some degree. Younger participants and women were most likely to report depression, anxiety, and loneliness. As in the previous survey, social inequality factors contributed to distress and loneliness. The small overall increase of distress was consistent with recent German panel studies. In future studies and mental health interventions female sex, younger age, and socioeconomic disparities need to be considered as vulnerability factors for distress.",

In a frequently quoted online survey of 1,210 participants from 194 Chinese cities, 54% of the participants reported moderate to severe distress, 29% reported anxiety and 17% depression symptoms 4 . In a German online survey conducted during the first lockdown, between March 27th and April 06th, 2020, 25% of the participants scored above the cut-offs for anxiety (GAD-2) and for depression (PHQ-2). They reported spending an average of almost five hours per day thinking about the pandemic, which exacerbated their stress 5 . A German cross-sectional online survey which ran from March to May 2020 with over 15,000 participants reported increased generalized anxiety (GAD-7) in 44.9%, depression in 14.3% (PHQ-2) and COVID-19-related fear in 59% of the participants 6 . Based on a total of 43 trials mostly from Asia and Europe, according to a recent meta-analysis, anxiety had tripled at the current rate of 25%, compared to previous rates of 7.3% 7 . Another meta-analysis even found that 31.9% of 63,439 people reported anxiety and 33.7% of 44,531 people depression symptoms 8 . However, the vast majority of studies relied on self-selection of participants by online advertisement and snowball effects and thereby excluded citizens without regular access to the internet 9 . Exemplarily, in one online survey, participants were predominantly female, of young age, highly educated, and health care staff was overrepresented 5 .",

At this time, lockdown measures were successively being reduced, however, most schools and childcare facilities remained closed. We used a representative cohort from 2018 which had been drawn by the same methods as pre-pandemic comparison. We aimed to answer the following research questions: 1. What is the level of depression and anxiety symptoms, and loneliness in the general population after the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic compared to previous mental health data? 2. How are sex, age, and socio-demographic factors such as low income, unemployment, migration status, and partnership related to distress and loneliness?",

While the sum scores of symptoms were slightly lower than the population norms in the 2018 assessment, they exceeded the norms in 2020 16 . In 2020, 11.6% of participants scored above the cut-off for depression, compared to 8.3% in 2018. A total of 11.1% scored above the cut-off for anxiety, compared to 7.5% in 2018. For loneliness, no significant change between 2018 and 2020 was found. In 2020, some degree of loneliness was reported by 23.1% of the participants as compared to 24 .5% in 2018. The data is presented in Table 1 . www.nature.com/scientificreports/ Figure 1 presents the mean level of depression symptoms in 2018 and 2020 stratified by age group and sex. As statistically tested using ANOVA, scores were higher in women vs. in men (sex), in 2020 vs. in 2018 (survey), and in younger vs. in older participants (age group). We also observed statistically significant interactions, i.e., scores increased more in women than in men (survey by sex), in the younger vs. older age groups (survey by age group), and in younger vs. older women (sex by age group). The largest increase was found in young women aged 14 to 29 years. Figure 2 presents the anxiety symptom scores in 2018 and 2020 stratified by age group and sex. As determined by the ANOVA, scores were higher in women vs. in men (sex) and in 2020 vs. in 2018 (survey). Again, there were significant interactions, i.e., sum scores increased more in women than in men (survey by sex), in the younger vs. the older age groups (survey by age group) and in younger vs. in older women (sex by age group). The largest increase was found in young women aged 14 to 29 years. Figure 3 presents the loneliness scores in 2018 and 2020 according to age group and sex. As determined by the ANOVA, scores were higher in women vs. in men (sex) and in older vs. in younger participants (age group). There was only a trend for an increase in 2020 vs. 2018 (survey). As the interaction effects indicated, scores increased more in women than in men (survey by sex), in the younger vs. in the older age groups (survey by age group) and in younger vs. in older women (sex by age group).

In the second survey, conducted in spring 2020 after initial lockdown measures had been eased, depression and anxiety symptoms, but not loneliness was significantly increased compared to the pre-pandemic assessment from 2018. However, the differences were small. In 2020, 11.6% of participants fulfilled the criteria for clinically significant depression symptoms (vs. 8.3% in 2018) and 11.1% scored above the cut-off for anxiety symptoms (vs. 7.5% in 2018). These findings contradict previous, internet-based, international, and German surveys, which found exceedingly high levels of depression and anxiety affecting 25% to 35% of participants during the pandemic [4] [5] [6] 8, 14 . Our findings regarding depression and anxiety were more consistent with two recent German longitudinal panel studies reporting small increases of distress 11, 12 . However, based on a single and validated item to assess loneliness, we only found an increase in young participants while other studies reported a significant increase of loneliness for all participants 11 . As findings from German online surveys were comparable to other international surveys, we would presume that cross-sectional online convenience samples are likely biased evoking responses from young and educated subgroups, and from those most preoccupied with the pandemic.",

Lack of a partnership was an additional risk factor for depression and loneliness, and migration background was associated with depression and anxiety.

Contrary to the expectations, in 2020 distress and loneliness had not increased in older individuals. However, particularly vulnerable subgroups of older people who are confined to nursing homes or disabled by chronic disease or frailty might be less likely to participate in any nationwide survey and be therefore underrepresented. The overall shifts we found were due to an increase of distress and loneliness in younger age groups, particularly those under 30 years. Carrying the lowest risk of severe disease, this age group has initially drawn little attention regarding mental health outcomes in the COVID-19 literature 20 . In this age group, however, many of the risk factors we assessed, apply, e.g., the lack of a partnership, and low household income. As previous research has argued 21 , young adulthood is a period with a high incidence of mental disorders and with strong needs for social relationships, activities with peers and large-scale events such as parties, sports events, movies, and concerts.

Moreover, according to recent German and US surveys, women have been overly burdened by conflicts between child care and work as schools and nurseries were closed 21 . Mothers were four to five times more likely to have reduced their working hours compared to fathers 22 .
