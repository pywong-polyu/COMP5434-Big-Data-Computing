Results exhibits that among 11 compounds from I. obscura (L.), urso-deoxycholic acid, demeclocycline, tetracycline, chlorotetracycline, and ethyl iso-allocholate had potential viral inhibitory activity.

It is native to parts of Africa, Asia, and certain Pacific Islands. Corolla is comprised of five fully fused petals. Seeds and fruits have been used as a cleansing agent to reduce breathing difficulties, alleviate pain, and improve vision (Shahina, 1994) . The phytochemical constituents of I. obscura promote anti-inflammatory activity, antioxidant activity, anticancer activity, and antimicrobial activity against certain microorganisms. Ayurveda has explored numerous medicinal properties of this plant against dysentery, ulcers, hemorrhoids, and swellings (Christophe & Pharm, 2002) .

SARS-CoV-2 falls under the genus of \u03b2 coronavirus (Markus et al., 2019) . The main pathways of COVID-19 infection in humans are through droplets, aerosols, feces, and mouth mucus membranes of infected person and cause adverse symptoms such as typical acute respiratory infection, cough, fever, myalgia, sneezing, acute kidney injury, fatigue, acute liver injury, diarrhea, a sore throat, breathing collapse, as well as vomiting (Anthony & Stanley, 2015) . The genome of corona virus composed of nonstructural proteins, accessory proteins, and structural proteins. Structural proteins had four major parts: one is spike surface glycol protein (S), tiny envelope protein (E), matrix protein (M), and nucleo-capsid protein. The corona virus protein is mainly responsible for entry of SARS-CoV-2 in to host cell (Yong & Edward, 2020) .",

The receptor-binding domain (RBD) of spike protein includes important amino acids (L455, F486, Q493, S494, N501, and Y505) that were involved in interaction and communication of single stranded RNA coronavirus genome (Andersen, Rambaut, Lipkin, Holmes, & Garry, 2020; Yifei, 2020) . So far, six RBD amino acids have shown best binding activities against ACE2 receptors and for determining the host tropism of SARS-CoV-like virus. The spike envelope glycoprotein interacts with cellular receptors ACE2 to initiate membrane fusion and viral replications after the proteolytic cleavage event. Subsequently, viral genome is released into the cytoplasm and replicated viral particles then ini-tiate the viral replication and cause adverse effect on a host organism. By blocking the ACE2/SARS-CoV-2 interaction, we could cease the viral replication and multiplication. The ACE2 and spike glycol protein may be considered as the attractive drug target for the discovery and development of effective antiviral drug against the viral disease (Bui et al., 2020; Fatima & Florian, 2020; Othman et al., 2020) .",

Besides the papain-like protease, this enzyme is necessarily aimed at the dispensation of polyproteins that endure translated since the viral RNA. Impeding the action of this enzyme would block viral replication. Subsequently, proteases reported from Homo sapiens do not cleave the functional site by hybrid analogues, which is yet to be discovered.

At present, there are no effective inhibitors against the novel corona virus; therefore, developing protein-based inhibitors for corona virus may emerge as a prerequisite strategy for curbing this virus. Computational methodologies have become an essential tool for drug discovery programs for the identification to lead optimization and formulation. Approaches such as ligand or structural based in silico techniques are commonly used in many discovery efforts. Henceforth, present investigation is carried out to identify bioactive compounds from I. obscura (L) and examine its antiviral activity against COVID-19 by the in silico approach.",

The existence of various bioactive compounds presents in plants provides evidence for the effective use against various ailments by conventional specialists. In the present work, phytochemicals were obtained from the leaf extract of I. obscura (L). by GC-MS analysis. It is noteworthy that the chemical compounds of I. obscura can inhibit the ACE2 protein and M pro to block the viral receptivity. The molecular interaction study claims that ursodeoxycholic acid from I. obscura (L.) efficiently binds with ACE2 and M Pro .
