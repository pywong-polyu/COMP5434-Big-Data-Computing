We conducted a cross-sectional online survey to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Brazilian HCW. Data were collected between 11 August and 1 November 2020. Of the 295 respondents, 95 (32.2%) were medical doctors, 82 (27.8%) administrative staff, 53 (18.0%) nurses, 27 (9.2%) laboratory staff, and 38 (12.9%) were other staff. COVID-19-related restructuring at the health facilities was reported by 207 (70.2%) respondents, and 69 (23.4%) had their tasks changed. Preventive measures were well respected when seeing suspected patients. Overall, 167 (56.6%) HCW screened positive for anxiety and 137 (46.4%) for depression; 109 (36.9%) screened positive for both conditions. Of the 217 (73.6%) HCW who had been tested for COVID-19, at least one positive result was reported in 49 (22.6%). Following a positive COVID-19 test, 45/49 (91.8%) stopped working and stayed home. In conclusion, we found a high incidence of COVID-19 infection among Brazilian HCW with high rates of anxiety and depression despite a good self-reported adherence to COVID-19 preventive measures. As such, our study highlights the urgent need for interventions to mitigate the psychosocial risks HCW in Brazil encounter during the COVID-19 pandemic.",

Health systems in many countries were overwhelmed, subjecting healthcare workers (HCW) to increased workloads with inherent pressures. HCW are more likely to be exposed to the virus given their proximity with patients, and many have witnessed unexpected changes in their work routines during the COVID-19 pandemic, including longer working hours and a change in tasks [2] [3] [4] [5] . As such, it was expected that the COVID-19 health crisis would profoundly affect their psychosocial well-being. Indeed, in a recent systematic review and meta-analysis incorporating data from 65 studies with a total of 97,333 HCW, the pooled prevalence of depression and anxiety was 21.7% and 22.1% respectively during the COVID-19 pandemic [6] .",

Brazil has been severely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. On 2 November 2020 (around the end of this survey) the country had reported a cumulative 5,631,181 COVID-19 cases, and 162,015 COVID-19 deaths, almost 30% of the number of cases in all the Americas [1] . By that time, the second wave of COVID-19 was yet to start. Driven by the surge of mutant viruses that escape neutralizing antibody responses, the second wave was still ongoing in April 2021 [13] . Hospitals were running out of drugs and oxygen [14] . In the province of Manaus, a resurgence of the pandemic was observed, despite the presence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) antibodies in 76% of the population [15] . In another study performed in Sao Paulo, south-eastern Brazil, in October 2020, the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 was estimated to be 29% [16] . A nation-wide serosurvey showed that the SARS-CoV-2 antibody prevalence was highly heterogeneous by country region [17] . Unfortunately, with the high community transmission rates, a president who is against lockdown measures, and the difficulties in rolling out the COVID-19 vaccination campaign, the end of the COVID-19 crisis in Brazil is not yet in sight [14, 15] .",

We hypothesized that the COVID-19 pandemic would have had an important impact on both the work routine of Brazilian HCW as well as their psychosocial well-being; this all coinciding with a high rate of COVID-19 infections. Participants were screened for anxiety and depression using the validated hospital anxiety and depression scale (HADS), which has been widely used to assess these conditions during the COVID-19 pandemic [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] . The HADS scale consisted of two main sections of seven questions each, one section screening for anxiety and the other for depression. Each answer was given in a 0-3 Likert scale, and participants with a HADS score of eight and above in each section were considered as screening positive for the condition (anxiety or depression). This cut-off value was based on previous studies conducted among HCW during the COVID-19 pandemic [24, 25] .",

Approximately one-third of the respondents in this study fulfilled the criteria of the clinical definition of COVID-19, and one-sixth reported at least one positive COVID-19 test. Studies in western countries also reported an increased prevalence of COVID-19 infection in HCW despite good availability of PPE and adherence to preventive and protective measures [35] [36] [37] . The reasons behind this observation warrant further investigation. It is possible that incorrect re-use of PPE as was reported in Brazil increased the risk of COVID-19 seropositivity [9, 38, 39] . One may also speculate that non-suspected, asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic patients could be an important source of transmission [40] [41] [42] [43] . Moreover, given the high rate of community COVID-19 transmission in Brazil, many HCW may also have been contaminated outside the workplace [15] [16] [17] . In a study conducted between March and June 2020 among HCW in Sao Paulo, Brazil, the use of public transport to commute between home and the hospital was associated with an increased chance of COVID-19 seropositivity [18] . Finally, it is important to note that the adherence to preventive measures in our study was self-reported without a possibility to verify the reliability of this information.",

In contrast, HCW working in a hospital that was restructured for COVID-19 care were less likely to have experienced a flu-like illness fulfilling the COVID-19 clinical case definition criteria. In a systematic review of 97 studies from Europe (31), the United States, (9) and Asia (6), including 230,398 HCW, the estimated prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection based on RT-PCR results was 11% (95% CI; 7-15%). Nurses were the most frequently affected HCW (48%), and most of the COVID-19 positive medical personnel were working in hospitalization/non-emergency wards [37] .

The prevalence of GAD and depressive symptoms was significantly higher in participants younger than 35 years than in participants aged 35 years or older. Compared with other occupational groups, HCW (23.6%) reported the highest rate of poor sleep quality [49] . Within the included HCW, a pooled analysis of 33,062 participants revealed gender and occupational differences with female HCW and nurses exhibiting higher rates of affective symptoms compared to male and medical staff, respectively. The latter is in line with the findings from our study, where the female gender was associated with a higher odd for anxiety as well as for depression. Being a medical doctor, nurse, or lab technician was associated with a higher odd for anxiety [50] . In another recent analysis incorporating 65 studies with a total of 97,333 HCW, the pooled prevalence of depression and anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic was 21.7% and 22.1%, respectively [6] .",

Secondly, it was difficult to estimate the increase in workload with the current design of our questionnaire. In addition, the questionnaire we used prohibited us from drawing a firm conclusion regarding the causal effect between different preventive measures for COVID-19 and the incidence of COVID-19. Thirdly, the sample size was limited and therefore detailed subgroup analysis was not possible. The questionnaire was distributed at a moment when Brazil was facing a high number of new COVID-19 cases and deaths. HCW were overwhelmed with work and therefore may have been too tired to participate in the survey. Lastly, we did not ask questions regarding the use of PPE to respondents who reported no close contact (<2 m) with suspected patients. As such, we cannot exclude that COVID-19 transmission occurred when caring for non-suspected COVID-19 patients or as a consequence of community transmission outside the health care setting, which may possibly explain the high incidence of COVID-19 noted in this study. Among the HCW that responded to the clinical definition or had a positive COVID-19 test, approximately 40% reported no close contact with COVID-19 suspected patients. Further studies are needed to investigate the underlying causes of the high COVID-19 incidence among Brazilian HCW.",

This requires a multi-dimensional approach that needs to include practical support such as providing safe areas for rest and relaxation at the workplace, accommodation solutions for HCW who cannot stay at their home, offering free meals, and childcare services. Sufficient recovering time is essential. Psychological support should be offered inside the healthcare settings, with the possibility of complementary support through a buddy system, informal support groups, a psychological hotline and/or other forms of telemedicine [51] . The way the health facility is managed is also important to reduce the stress among HCW. Consultation and engagement with HCW is key. The management should listen to them and address their safety, financial, organizational, and other concerns. The work of the HCW should be valued, and they should be remunerated appropriately. They should feel supported by society and the authorities.",
