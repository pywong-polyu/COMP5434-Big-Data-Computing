Simultaneously, technological advances have been regularly released, including advanced reconstruction algorithms, digital PET and motion correction, which have allowed the PET community to detect ever-smaller cancer lesions, improving diagnostic performance in the context of indications previously viewed as limitations, such as detection of in-transit disease and confirmation of the nature of small pulmonary metastases apparent on CT. This review will provide advice regarding melanoma-related PET protocols and will focus on variants encountered during the imaging of melanoma patients. Emphasis will be made on pitfalls related to non-malignant diseases and treatment-related findings that may confound accurate interpretation unless recognized. The latter include signs of immune activation and immune-related adverse events (irAEs). Technology-related pitfalls are also discussed, since while new PET technologies improve detection of small lesions, these may also induce false-positive cases and require a learning curve to be observed. In these times of the COVID 19 pandemic, cases illustrating lessons learned from COVID 19 or vaccination-related pitfalls will also be described.",

Unlike other solid tumors, melanoma mostly affects young and middleaged people. The median age at the time of diagnosis of melanoma is 57 years [1] . However, in Australia, which has one of the highest incidences of melanoma in the world, the rate of new diagnoses increases with age, particularly in males. Close to 80% of cases present with early-stage disease (https://ncci.canceraustralia.gov.au/ diagnosis/distribution-cancer-stage/distribution-cancerstage) and have high survival rates. High-risk melanoma represents a major burden on society through both direct costs and loss of productivity.",

A: zoomed MIP images; B: transverse PET slices and C corresponding CT slices. Subcutaneous 18 F-FDG foci related to in-transit metastases can be seen on the right leg (red arrows). Also visible are foci related to venous varicosity, not to be mistaken for subcutaneous metastases (orange arrow). It is noteworthy that in-transit metastases are only clearly visible on digital images reconstructed with small-voxels. EARL-compliant images, which mimic former generation PET systems by applying a post-reconstruction filtering step [23] , are equivocal. EARL: European Association of Nuclear Medicine Research limited Serial MIP images (A) in a patient with widespread metastatic melanoma demonstrate resolution of an in-transit deposit on the lateral aspect of the left leg (arrow on baseline scan) and gradual regression of metastatic disease over time despite residual left inguinal nodal abnormality after 6 months of immune checkpoint therapy. On coronal PET and CT images (B), nodular but contiguous linear uptake in the subcutaneous fat along the medial left thigh demonstrates no change over time on the MIP images above and clinically correlated with a varicose vein. Transaxial images (C) are more difficult to interpret than the coronal images in demonstrating mildly 18 F-FDG -avid nodularity and a rounded shape on correlative CT, emphasizing the importance of review of images in orthogonal planes [10] . A varying percentage (14% [11] to 67% [12] ) of patients presenting with single organ metastasis at the time of tumor relapse has been reported in large series of patients referred to surgery, though these figures were reported at a time when modern PET sytems were not routinely used for staging and restaging of melanoma patients.",

First, while including the brain in the field of view is not routine at many PET centres, the skull base should be included, at least for therapy assessment examinations, so that immune-related hypophysitis can be detected. While MRI is the preferred method for assessing brain and leptomeningeal metastases from melanoma, the high metabolic activity of melanoma, particularly when accompanied by surrounding vasogenic oedema can make intracranial involvement readily apparent on PET and given the small incremental imaging time to acquire from the vertex of the skull, this is recommended by the authors. When the arms are elevated to improve imaging of the thorax and axillae, more of the upper limbs are also included when whole-brain imaging is acquired.",

This patient received her first dose of COVID 19 vaccine in the right deltoid muscle (Pfizer-BioNtec Cominarty) 21 days prior to the PET examination. Multiple reactive nodes can be seen on the right axillae. Note that some of these nodes have benign CT patterns (bottom right panel: fatty hilum) while others may be considered suspicious based on CT appearance (top right panel: round shape, loss of the fatty hilum pattern). In this case, spread to the contralateral axilla from a leg primary without regional nodal or distant metastatic involvement should alert the reader to a low likelihood of malignancy lower limbs and the arms along the body for primary tumours located on the upper limbs. Indeed, digital PET using small-voxel reconstructions [24] or modern reconstruction algorithms [25] brings an additional value for the detection of in-transit metastases in melanoma patients, by reducing the number of indeterminate findings and minimizing falsely negative scans compared to earlier PET systems. It is noteworthy that for overweight patients, hands should be positioned on the pelvis to avoid any truncation artefact of the arms at the edges of the field of view [26] .",

This is more problematic in overweight or obese patients in whom statistical considerations lead to greater inhomogeneity of apparent 18 F-FDG uptake (as shown in Figs. 7 and 8 below) , indeterminate 18 F-FDG foci should lead to follow-up PET or additional radiological exploration. It is expected that technological evolutions such as digital PET with smallvoxel reconstruction and/or enhancement of images with the convolutional neural network will further improve image quality in the liver and detection of small volume metastatic disease [34] . Because of the para-magnetic properties of melanin, MRI is a relatively sensitive technique for the detection of uveal melanoma metastases to liver and should be recommended in the setting of clinical suspicion or equivocal PET/CT findings.",

Axillary nodal dissection demonstrated 1/9 lymph nodes involved with 8 mm deposit and 0.3 mm extranodal extension (stage IIIB) BRAF V600K.

MRI brain also showed small new cerebral metastases (stage IV-M1b). Treatment subsequently changed to Dabrafenib and Trametinib, which was poorly tolerated with recurrent episodes of fever, myalgia and fatigue. Surveillance 18 F-FDG PET/CT scans were performed 3 monthly afterwards; the 1st follow-up 18 F-FDG PET/CT showed an enlarged spleen with multiple foci of moderately increased FDG uptake (red arrow -B). The treatment regimen changed to 4 days on and 3 days off; however, this was also poorly tolerated and the patient was switched to Encorafenib and binimetinib with subsequent scans showing a mild interval splenic enlargement and reversal of the spleen to liver activity (blue arrows -D,E).

ICI administration led to the development of widespread cutaneous lesions with associated axillary and inguinal nodal uptake apparent on 18 F-FDG PET/CT.

On coronal PET and CT images (B), nodular but contiguous linear uptake in the subcutaneous fat along the medial left thigh demonstrates no change over time on the MIP images above and clinically correlated with a varicose vein. Transaxial images (C) are more difficult to interpret than the coronal images in demonstrating mildly 18 F-FDG -avid nodularity and a rounded shape on correlative CT, emphasizing the importance of review of images in orthogonal planes",

A new FDG-avid nodule was noted in the left lower lobe (panel B and C) which due to respiratory movement appeared ill-defined. A dedicated CT of the chest 7 days later confirmed the nodule in the left lower lobe (panel D) and also showed an additional nodule in the right lower lobe (panel G) which went undetected on the PET/CT (panel E and F) and were suspicious for metastatic melanoma. Wedge resection of the left lower lobe revealed caseation granuloma and the patient continued on surveillanceFig. 8 71-year-old woman with metastatic uveal melanoma, and previous central liver resection for solitary metastasis. Follow-up 18 F-FDG PET images 6 months post-surgery showed at least two foci of low-grade 18 F-FDG uptake in the liver, slightly above the physiological background activity (black arrows, image Azoomed MIP). The lesion in segment 4a just left to the surgical margin (red arrow on image B -axial fused image) was subsequently confirmed to be metastatic melanoma on histology.
