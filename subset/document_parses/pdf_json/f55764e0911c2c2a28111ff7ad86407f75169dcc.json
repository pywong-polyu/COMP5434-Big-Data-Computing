SARS-CoV-2 uses ACE2 as a cell receptor, TMPRSS2 protease, and FURIN peptidase to invade human cells. Here, we investigated 1,378 whole-exome sequences of individuals from the Middle Eastern populations (Kuwait, Qatar, and Iran) to explore natural variations in the ACE2, TMPRSS2, and FURIN genes. We identified two activating variants (K26R and N720D) in the ACE2 gene that are more common in Europeans than in the Middle Eastern, East Asian, and African populations. We postulate that K26R can activate ACE2 and facilitate binding to S-protein RBD while N720D enhances TMPRSS2 cutting and, ultimately, viral entry. We also detected deleterious variants in FURIN that are frequent in the Middle Eastern but not in the European populations. This study highlights specific genetic variations in the ACE2 and FURIN genes that may explain SARS-CoV-2 clinical disparity. We showed structural evidence of the functionality of these activating variants that increase the SARS-CoV-2 aggressiveness. Finally, our data illustrate a significant correlation between ACE2 variants identified in people from Middle Eastern origins that can be further explored to explain the variation in COVID-19 infection and mortality rates globally.",

The genetic susceptibility to has also been explored by scrutinizing Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) genetic variations in different populations. ACE2 is the functional receptor mediating entry of SARS-CoV-2 into the host cells 5 , which is facilitated by FURIN cleavage [6] [7] [8] . Transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) is another candidate gene that has been linked to COVID-19 disease [8] [9] [10] .

Two such genetic variants existed in our data ( Table 1 ). The first, rs4646116, is a missense variant that changes a lysine amino acid at position 26 to arginine (K26R) ( Table 1 ). The K26, which is just proximal to the first region of the ACE2 receptor involved in S-protein binding, has been shown previously to bind the sterically hindering first mannose in the glycan that is linked to N90 and thus stabilizes the glycan moiety hindering the binding of S-protein RBD to ACE2 24 (Fig. 1a) . The missense variant R26 creates a new hydrogen bond with D30, which is then poised to build a salt-bridge with the S-protein RBD K417 that increases the affinity of SARS-CoV-2 to the ACE2 receptor 18 (Fig. 1b) . Indeed, the ACE2 K26R activating variant was extremely rare in East Asian (MAF=0.007%), Africans (MAF=0.095%), but the second most common variant in Europeans with MAF of 0.587% (shown in green fonts in Table 1 ). The MAF of this variant in the Kuwaiti population was nearly half that of Europeans (MAF=0.29%), and it was absent from the Qatari and Iranian exome data (Table 1 ). Our structural modeling supports the notion that K26R is an ACE2 receptor activating variant (Fig. 1a, b) .",

Like ACE2, all the identified variants were rare in the Middle Eastern populations. However, unlike the ACE2 gene, no novel variants were observed in FURIN in the Middle Eastern population (Table 3) . Among the 13, we detected seven deleterious variants suggesting a possible decrease in FURIN protease function, which can potentially reduce the risk of SARS-CoV-2 in the studied populations. In this context, deleterious FURIN gene variations were observed least in East Asians, Africans, followed by Europeans then Iranians (Table 4 ). Interestingly, both in Qatar and Kuwait the deleterious FURIN genetic variations were more common, suggesting a possible protective effect against the SARS-CoV-2 (p<0.05; Table 4 ). For example, the MAF of R37C, and R81C in Kuwait and Qatar were 0.4%/0.7% and 2.4%/3.4% respectively compared to significantly lower MAF in corresponding variants in Europeans (p<0.05; Table 4 ). Together, these data support the premise that FURIN gene variants may play important roles in protection against SARS-CoV-2 in the Middle East. It is worth noting, however, that in Africa FURIN gene variants may not be a contributing factor in viral protection (Table 4) . We next sought to determine the extent of FURIN expression in the Middle East. We detected 16 FURIN eQTL variants in the Middle Eastern populations, most of which were reported in the Qatar population (Supplementary Table 5 ). We observed a high frequency of the FURIN upregulating variants, rs6226 (93%) and rs8039305 (81%) in the African populations compared to the Middle Eastern, European and East Asian populations (p<0.05) (Supplementary Table 5 ). In the GeneATLAS PheWAS database 38 40 circulating between Qatar, Kuwait and Europe, which was attributed to traveling and repatriation between these countries (Manuscript in preparation; GISAID 40 ). For these reasons, we argued that the most likely explanation for the differences observed in mortality rate among countries may be attributed to genetic variation in human genes involved in SARS-CoV-2 processing and cellular entry or exit. Therefore, we screened the genetic variations and eQTL expression of the SARS-CoV-2 candidate genes, ACE2, TMPRSS2 and FURIN in three Middle Eastern populations: Kuwaiti, Iranian, and Qatari and compared them to available MAF data in the gnomAD database 41 .",

Our data suggest that the ACE2 receptor Notably, the ACE2 novel variant Q661P is close to the aa region 652-659, which is important for cleavage by the metalloprotease ADAM17. R716H and the two deleterious variants R708W and R708Q are located within residues 697-716 essential for cleavage by TMPRSS11D and TMPRSS2. In fact, the mutation of arginine -such as R708-and lysine residues within aa residues 697-716 markedly reduced ACE2 cleavage by TMPRSS2 43 . However, it should be mentioned that sequentially distant aa residues in the ACE2 receptor can be seen brought structurally proximal to each other to create active sites for catalysis 28 . We illustrated this in Supplementary Fig. 6 to show that the novel aa changes (colored green) are proximal to the protein residues that mediate its activity (colored blue and red). Further studies are needed to directly assess the functional aspects of the reported missense variants. We urge the international community to assess ACE2 variation differences among people with mild/asymptomatic disease versus patients presenting with severe respiratory distress syndrome.",

This may indicate that natural immunity conferred by the ACE2 receptor variations is lacking or extremely rare. The rareness is evident from a recent comprehensive study that scrutinized ACE2 gene variations in more than 290,000 individuals from 400 different worldwide population groups and in which only eight rare ACE2 gene missense variants (K31R, E35K, E37K, D38V, N33I, H34R, Y83H, and Q388L) with reduced binding to the S-protein of SARS-CoV-2 were reported 18 . Notably, this study has disproved the claim of Cao and colleagues on the absence of such protective ACE2 variants in human populations 15 .",

Further, a recent study that profiled scRNA-seq from the human testicles revealed the presence of this receptor in Spermatogonia, Leydig and Sertoli Cells 45 . These findings may indicate that human testis is a potential target for coronavirus conforming to male prevalence in infected cases. Notably, in our data, Kuwaiti individuals carrying ACE2 missense variants were all males. Also, a Chinese population study observed a higher hemizygous mutation rate in males than females 15 . It is also possible that the high hemizygosity seen in males can be responsible for male prevalence in infected cases. This hypothesis can be further supported by the recent detection of SARS-CoV-2 virus in the semen of infected people 46, 47 .",

Discussion At the time of writing this study, SARS-CoV-2 has infected 4,271,689 people worldwide, with over 1,665,097 cases in Europe, and 1,385,834 cases in the United States, approximately 82,919 cases in China, 109,286 cases in Iran, 23,623 cases in Qatar and 9286 cases in Kuwait 1 . Mortality rates varied significantly around the world, with the highest reported deaths per 1 million people reported in Belgium, Spain, Italy, United Kingdom, and France reaching 756, 572, 508, 472, and 408 deaths/1 million respectively 1 . Deaths per 1 million people in China, Japan, Qatar, Kuwait, and South Africa were significantly lower at 3, 5, 5, 15, and 3 respectively and moderately higher in Iran that reported the highest deaths per 1 million people in Asia at 80 deaths/1 million people 1 . The lower infection and fatality rates in developing countries obviously cannot be attributed to increased number of tests or better medical services than what is already provided in Europe. Moreover, prior knowledge of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome revealed by whole genome sequencing of the virus, performed by us and others, has shown remarkable genetic similarities among the virus",

Interestingly, the prevalence of the most ACE2 activating variant N720D (rs41303171) was highest among Europeans (2.5%), Iranians (0.6%) when compared to Kuwaitis (0.3%), Qataris (0.2%) and other global populations (0.4%) and MAF of these variants significantly correlated with mortality rates in the corresponding countries and lower infection rates in Kuwait(Fig. 3). However, further functional assessments are required to confirm our predictions.Additionally, we showed high prevalence of frequent deleterious FURIN variants in the Middle Eastern populations, especially Kuwait and Qatar, which indicated decreased FURIN protease activity that further reduces the risk of viral infection. As such, our results suggest a possible protective role of FURIN gene variants against the SARS-CoV-2 infection in the studied Middle Eastern populations. However, the data presented here add another variable that needs to be urgently addressed. It is not unreasonable to suggest that European human genetic variation presents optimal access for SARS-CoV-2 infection, whereas Iranian genetic background presents sub-optimal opportunities for the infection, and finally, Kuwaitis and Qataris have the least natural inducive genetic background in the ACE2 and FURIN proteins combined for viral entry.While the MAF of ACE2 variant, R708W in Kuwait is 0.105%, which may indicate again a protective role in the Kuwaiti population, the absence of this and the other four deleterious variants from Africa, East-Asia 41 , Qatar 42 does not explain the lower disease burden in these countries. Similarly, we did not observe a significant difference in the burden of novel deleterious variants comparing the Kuwaiti population with Europeans(Table 2), although they may play a protective role against COVID-19 locally. The functional roles of the two Kuwait-specific and the two Iran-specific ACE2 deleterious novel variants Q661P (MAF=0.1%), A372G (MAF=0.2%) and V485L (MAF=0.18%), F452V (MAF=0.08%) respectively are yet to be experimentally determined.",

Especially that in the context of a pandemic, rare variants that increase or decrease disease susceptibility become quantitatively important since millions of people may be infected. The decreased burden of rare deleterious variants and the increased MAF in variants that activate the ACE2 receptor in the European population suggest an inherent susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection and vice versa in the Middle Eastern population. We understand that other confounding factors like SARS-CoV-2 testing, socioeconomical status, the availability of proper medical services and the higher burden of other diseases may be important contributors to the disparities seen in mortality rates around the world. It is imperative that more comprehensive studies should be conducted as more patient data emerges from different parts of the world.
