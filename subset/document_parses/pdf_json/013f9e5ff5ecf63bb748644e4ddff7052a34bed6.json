These changes sometimes create harmful habits and affect our lifestyle, which unfortunately bring various diseases and disorders. ADHD (Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder) & SPD (Sensory Processing Disorder) are common disorders in children. By giving children the right treatment at the younger ages, we can help them overcome their disabilities and not face any symptoms in their adulthood. The multi-sensory balance board is designed and developed to help medics diagnose the disorders in patients at early stages and monitor the treatment progress. The balance board uses multiple sensors to detect common human senses, visual, auditory, balance, and tactile sensing. Due to the safety issues for children during the COVID-19 pandemic, the balance board has been clinically tested for adults with stroke disorder. The research has concluded that it provides a fast low-cost with reliable results to diagnose the disorders in patients.",
