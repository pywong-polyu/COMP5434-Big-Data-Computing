Continuous variables were expressed as mean \u00b1 standard deviation while categorical data were expressed as absolute values and proportions. The Fisher exact test and the t-test or the Mann-Whitney U test were applied as appropriate. Survival curves were plotted using the Kaplan-Meier method with log-rank test and COX-regression model was applied. Analyses were performed with SPSS, Statistical Package for Social Science) software (v26, SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). For all the statistical analyses, a two tailed p < 0.05 was considered significant.",

These patients may benefit from a more intensive treatment for primary prevention of thrombo-embolic events, representing, among all cardiovascular-diseased COVID-19 patients, a high-risk group. Although further studies from larger population cohorts are required to assess the prognostic role of AF in COVID-19, these patients are potentially fragile and vulnerable, characterized by a higher risk of death, thus suitable for a careful clinical monitoring and more intensive treatment [7] . The CHA 2 DS 2 VASc score may be useful in further risk stratification of COVID-19 [8] and early identification of AF with routine ECG evaluation may be helpful in risk assessment and therapy approach individualization.",
