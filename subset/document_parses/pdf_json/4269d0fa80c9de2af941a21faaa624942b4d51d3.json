            "text": "The operational simplicity of smartphones, with consistent advances in camera technology and image processing, make them suitable for imaging in ophthalmology for screening as well as for certain diagnostic imaging. Another key feature of smartphones is that their seamless integration with cloud connectivity facilitates scalable telehealth opportunities. This feature includes remote synchronous and asynchronous teleconsultations for regular eye care, postsurgical monitoring as well as in emergency care contexts. 4, [6] [7] [8] [9] In this study, we report a novel design for a portable digital slit lamp (PSL D20) that works on an advanced optical design and documents images instantly with the help of a smartphone. We have focused specifically on design ergonomics to make it usable by nonspecialized health care workers, with minimum training. The key challenge in anterior segment imaging using a slit lamp has often been the small depth of focus between the planes of the iris, lens, and the cornea. This feature makes it very difficult to use such devices in a handheld mode. The Remidio PSL D20 device uses an on-phone image processing algorithm that automatically extracts frames with peak sharpness from videos to produce the best possible images where the lens, iris and cornea may be independently in focus. This effectively decreases or, in many cases, eliminates defocused images. We have compared the performance of the PSL D20 device with that of traditional digital slit lamps, from a resolution perspective. The device comes with a built-in, HIPAA compliant patient management software that synchronizes the images with a secure cloud server. It is telemedicine friendly, allowing for even a synchronous use with screen mirroring over third-party video applications like Zoom, Google Meet, and Webex and can be used effectively to bridge the existing screening gaps in delivery of quality health care, especially in the COVID-19 era.",

It has separate paths for illumination and imaging to get clear images of the anterior segment, devoid of artefacts. Light from the multicolor LED source passes through the condenser lens as a single convergent beam and then through the illumination lens. It is then reflected via an anti-reflectioncoated right-angled prism to illuminate the eye. The entire illumination set-up is mounted on a slit swiveling system that can be rotated to 45\u00b0on both sides, depending on the physician's requirement. The reflected ray then passes along the imaging plane, crossing two sets of imaging lenses, to be captured by the smartphone, post an optical magnification. The slit width can be controlled between 0 and 12 mm. The length of the slit is fixed at 12 mm. Instant photodocumentation is done on a smartphone (we tested the device on both iPhone 7 and iPhone SE 2020 because they have nearly similar features in terms of the camera resolution) (Apple Inc., Cupertino, CA). Both phones use the Sony Exmor RS sensors (Sony Corporation or Son\u012b kabushiki kaisha, Tokyo, Japan). The PSL D20 captures images at a resolution of 4032 \u00d7 3024 pixels (approximately 12 megapixels), uses a sensor with a pixel size of 1.22 \u03bcm and a contrast ratio of 1400:1. The resulting image is viewed on the phone screen with a resolution of 750 \u00d7 1334 pixels and a pixel density of approximately 326 ppi, and can also be screen mirrored via an Apple TV.",

Initial prototypes were tested for ergonomic handling and ease of use among health workers, paramedics in the field and optometrists and ophthalmologists in hospitals ( Fig. 2A) . Because a good grip determines the ease of use of the device, we prototyped several handle designs inspired from common everyday objects with proven designs, such as handheld tape dispensers. Once we narrowed on two options, a 3-dimensional (3D) printed version was given to a set of people with varying hand sizes. Given that the average hand length (perpendicular to the wrist) was measured to be 170 mm (for adult women) and 180 mm (for adult men), 10,11 a pilot set of 12 volunteers were chosen with hand measurements ranging from 160 to 190 mm (Fig. 3) to express their views on the ease of handling and the grip while using the device in the field. Keeping their responses in mind, we decided the final dimensions of the handle and design of the grip. This user-based approach helped us to design a compact, portable, easy-to-use, and light-weight device without compromising on its image quality.",

The battery, electronic components, and the illumination optics have been arranged in a compact, linear design to fit within the handle of the device. The handle diameter comes comfortably within the grip of a single hand (Figs. 4 and 5). This feature, makes it much smaller than the available, high-end portable slit lamps. The device has an adjustable headrest for convenience of (manual) focusing, with a 4\u00d7 optical magnification. This feature makes the object of focus visible clearly on the phone screen, contributing to the stability of the device and allowing easy capture of images just by looking at the phone screen instead of a binocular in most high-end portable slit lamps, (Fig. 6 ). The background light has three variants-white LED, blue, and green-to suit specific examination techniques. One can effectively operate the PSL D20 using four controls: a button to toggle between background illumination lights, a button to capture the image, and a knob to adjust the slit beam intensity; the three fall comfortably within the grasp of the thumb (Fig. 5) . A knob to adjust the variable slit width is located on the swiveling optomechanical unit, underneath the prism. The controls make it convenient for the user to adjust to the ambient light conditions when imaging a patient's eye. The optomechanical illumination unit is supported by a pair of ball spring plungers to provide the necessary friction and prevent variation of angles when a patient is being examined. The design ergonomics make PSL D20 stand out among other portable slit lamps. When not in use, the device is mounted on a docking station (Fig. 4) .",

Using external light sources helped in varying the intensity of the slit beam, implementing diffuse illumination on the same device, maneuvering of the slit angle between 0\u00b0and 45\u00b0on each side, thus allowing for different illumination techniques, and achieving an overall bright illumination system, mimicking the mode of action of standard slit lamps.

It allows users to manually focus on the desired part of the eye and capture images instantly, depending on the distance of the imaging lens from the part of the eye of interest, similar in optical design to a traditional fixed focus desktop slit lamp. The focus on the phone is thus driven by the focus of the portable digital slit lamp without further adjustments. This ensures that the physician sees and captures exactly what one chooses to focus on, be it the lens, iris, or the cornea, ensuring imaging objectivity. The working distance (between the patient's eye and the objective lens) is 61 mm (Fig. 5) . The smartphone-based display also ensures that the physician can remain physically distanced during the COVID-19 pandemic with a minimum distance of 0.6 m from the patient. The aperture of \u0192/1.8 along with a minimum angle of resolution of 45\u00b0and a depth of focus of 0.0574 mm (57.4 \u03bcm) allows for distinguishing between different planes of the anterior segment, antero-posteriorly, with a minimum distance of 57.4 \u03bcm between them. [12] [13] [14] [15] An Air Force (AF) resolution test card (U. S. Air Force 1951, Edmund Optics, Inc, Barrington, NJ) was used to test the spatial resolution in specific magnification on the PSL D20 and compared the same to the resolution of two standard slit lamps (Labomed America Inc., Feasterville, PA, and Inami & Co.

Figures 7 to 9 show the test results (captured on iPhone 7 and SE 2020 screens) with a magnification of 4\u00d7.

For each frame, we extract the area of interest by binary thresholding, apply a Difference of Gaussians (DoG) filter, and compute the variance of the filter output on the thresholded area. This value is interpreted as a sharpness metric. We then assess how the value evolves along the frames of the video and detect peaks.

The performance of the portable, digital slit lamp was determined to be sensor resolution and performance oriented, instead of the optical design. This was justified when we compared the resolution of the PSL D20 to standard, desktop-based slit lamps using an AF target, giving similar resolutions at lower magnifications. Additionally, to obtain traceability on image quality with standard slit lamps, we also compared the PSL D20 in terms of magnification. PSL D20 comes with all key features of a conventional slit lamp, in terms of modes of illumination and background AF resolution test for PSL D20 at 4\u00d7 optical magnification (along with maximum digital magnification); image captured on iPhone 7 (image quality on phone sensors differs from camera sensors in desktop-based slit lamps). The resolution thus measured has been shown in Table 3 . light, and with a simpler mode of operation, based on a smartphone. We used both the iPhone 7 and the iPhone SE 2020 owing to similar camera sensors and an affordable pricing. We adopted a user-based approach to ease on the usability and enhance its operational simplicity. The slit intensity and width can be controlled, and the background illumination can be changed with minimum hassles, without hampering the focus. A 4\u00d7 optical magnification on the PSL D20 was shown to be equivalent to a 10\u00d7 magnification on standard slit lamps. An offline image processing algorithm was developed to extract frames with peak sharpness in a video taken by the Figure 14 . Frames corresponding to the peaks illustrated as green dots in Figure 13 , with a focus on the cornea (A, B) , iris (C, D), and lens (E, F) in diffuse and slit illumination respectively on the PSL D20. PSL D20, thereby decreasing a technician's effort to correctly focus on the iris, lens, or the cornea each time during image capture. The focus of the phone is driven by the manual focus of the physician, and hence what is seen on the phone is what one gets. A holistic patient management software ensures that all images captured are stored securely in a HIPAAcompliant cloud server powered by Google Cloud Platform. Our pilot telemedicine feasibility study showed that the attending technician could integrate the PSL D20 application with any third-party video conferencing applications (such as Zoom, Google Meet, or Webex) and share screen with a specialist, to get an opinion on the spot within a maximum span of five minutes. Alternatively, the images could be stored on the secure cloud server and accessed by a specialist, remotely, as per convenience. This feature made the setup cater to both synchronous and asynchronous modes of teleophthalmology. The use of screen mirroring with Apple TV (Apple Inc.) allows for the images to also be seen with minimal lag, wirelessly, on smart TVs for educating patients and training residents.",

            "text": "We constructed the PSL D20 keeping in mind three major constraints faced in present times: fewer portable devices for screening the anterior segment, travelling constraints in remote areas, operational complexities of available portable slit lamps, higher costs, and a lack of objective, instantaneous photodocumentation. The devices reported in literature in the past have focused on ideas to improve screening methods using portable slit lamps. Kumar et al. 2 used the Lion's Eye Institute Portable Slit lamp camera, with a fixed slit beam. Image documentation was done by freezing a video frame, captured on a video camera fixed as a part of the device and compared with those on a standard Zeiss (Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany) 40SL/P slit lamp camera in terms of image quality. It showed that pathologies like cataracts and corneal grafts and opacities were equally well detected in both devices. 2 This trial was key in proving that digital images on the portable slit lamp were of equal diagnostic quality in comparison to traditional slit lamps in case of gross corneal pathologies. Posterior subcapsular opacities, lid pathologies, and a few in the iris could not be well-detected in this case. A major drawback here was the fixed slit thickness. Other factors hampering the quality of images in this study were lack of maneuvering capacity for the operators, leading to limited focusing, and a shallow depth of focus. Multiple studies have shown acceptable image quality using adaptors with smartphones, to mimic portable screening systems. [16] [17] [18] However, few have focused on the criticality of slit thickness when it comes to anterior segment imaging. Specialists in ophthalmology imaging need a narrow slit light that is thinner than the pupil width of 2 to 8 mm to ensure that the slit light reaches the crystalline lens. 19 Recently, Hu et al. 20 reported another smartphone-based adaptor to screen for cataracts-but this was not a full-fledged portable slit lamp. The device was effective in focusing on the anterior capsule, cortex, and posterior capsule of the lens of the eye. A drawback in this case was adjusting the light intensity. Moving the patient to a dimly lit room or making them wear a dark chamber would also hamper the focus of the device. There was no mention of any light filter that could be used to suit specific illumination needs, like tracing inflamed blood vessels, viewing hemorrhages, examining the tear film, or viewing damaged corneal epithellia. 20 A study by Yazu et al. 16 demonstrated a portable smartphonebased screening device to screen and grade nuclear cataracts. Their design, called the Smart Eye Camera, is based on a 3D printed adapter that could be attached to a smartphone camera used for capturing and grading nuclear cataracts in human eyes. 16, 21 However, it was only reported to have been used for grading nuclear cataracts. Moreover, there was no traceability in terms of image resolution and magnification for this device against standard slit lamps. 16 A commercially available portable slit lamp, S150 (MediWorks, Shanghai, China) can attach a smartphone to its magnetic pad to digitize the device. A drawback here is the lack of a proper casing or holding pad for the smartphone that may alter the focus. There is no headrest to support or stabilize the focus of the device and no mention of a red-free filter as well. 22 A list of features distinguishing PSL D20 from other commercially available portable slit lamps is presented in Table 4 .",

            "text": "The PSL D20 overcomes the aforementioned drawbacks with a higher resolution (approximately 12 megapixels), adjustable slit beam, with the ability to focus on all parts of the anterior segment uniformly-be it the eyelids, lens, cornea, or the iris. It allows for maneuvering the angles of illumination, intensity, and the background light-LED, blue, and red free-all controls falling within the grasp of the thumb while operating it single handedly. The PSL D20 caters to both synchronous and asynchronous modes of telemedicine, making it ideal for access across remote or rural areas. In addition to screening camps and clinics, the PSL D20 can also be used to conduct bedside examination for patients needing emergency care, wheelchair-bound patients, and critical care patients alike, where imaging can be undertaken at the point-of-care. Studies have shown the use of portable, nondigital, slit lamps in ventilated patients in Intensive Care Units (ICUs) wherein doctors and staff have used the devices to screen for ocular surface disorders like exposure keratopathy, conjunctival and corneal infections. 23 Another benefit of using teleophthalmology-based systems in the current pandemic-struck environment is the practice of examining from a safe distance. Studies have shown a statistically significant and relevant increase in ophthalmic examination distance between doctors and patients using telemedicine-based devices. Traditional slit lamp-based examination distance increased from 27 to 67 cm and portable slit lamp examination distance increased from 18 to 55 cm in these cases. 24 In our case, this distance was a minimum of 600 cm, making it even more relevant for use in the COVID-19 era. Using an iPhone 7 or SE 2020 decreased the cost significantly, allowing for a competitive pricing for the device. A few limitations faced while using the PSL D20 include use of concomitant gonioscopic lenses and applanation tonometry that is possible in the case of conventional, desktop-based slit lamps. However, these techniques are more relevant in a specialist context and 16I ). We also explored the possibility of retroillumination ( Fig. 16H ) with the device as well, something that was missing in literature among the available portable, digital slit lamps. By placing the slit illumination beam nearly coaxial to the imaging lens, with a slight 5\u00b0o ff center, capturing retroillumination images is possible. However, this maneuver will require a certain level of expertise on the technician's part. The corneal endothelium with a monolayer of cells is required to be viewed by specular reflection illumination using a slit lamp biomicroscope at 40\u00d7 magnification. The current version of PSL D20 can only view objects with a minimum size of 57 \u03bcm. Similarly, detection of flare and occasional cells in the anterior chamber as a marker of early signs of inflammation is a limitation of the current version of the PSL D20 given a higher magnification requirement. We plan to address this limitation in the next version of the device by using lenses with a higher magnification. In the context of screening, the utility of many of these techniques is far from essential, requires the presence of an ophthalmologist and can be deferred to be conducted after referral. ",

Advancement of technology has made it possible to use smartphones as reliable devices for anterior segment ophthalmic imaging. A portable digital slit lamp like the PSL D20 stands out in the smartphone-based anterior segment screening space owing to its simple and ergonomically sound design with key features comparable with conventional slit lamps, as well as its ability to focus distinctively on different layers of the anterior segment using a thin slit beam to capture instant images, and even produce the sharpest frames from any video captured. Its holistic design as a screening solution includes a patient management software for secure data storage and teleconsultation. The feasibility of both synchronous and asynchronous teleophthalmology consultation can thus be impactful during the COVID-19 era.
