Eligible participants were men and non-pregnant women, at least 18 years of age with a body mass index (BMI) of 16 to 41 (kg/m 2 ).

The group of over 60 years olds accounted for at least 1,200 participants. 13 ,000 participants were recruited. A subset of the first 1000 participants were evaluated for immunogenicity, in addition to the safety and efficacy (Phase 3a) while the remaining 12,000 participants were followed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the Nanocovax vaccine (Phase 3b). After enrollment, the first 1000 participants were randomly assigned to either the 'vaccinate' or 'placebo' groups by the Electronic Clinical Data Management (ECDM) system with a ratio of 6 vaccine:1 placebo. The remaining 12,000 were randomly assigned by the ECDM system to either the 'vaccine' or 'placebo' group, in a block of 3 with a ratio of 2 vaccine:1 placebo. All participants received 2 injections of vaccine or placebo on Day 0 and Day 28.

Firstly, the dominant virus strain changed in Vietnam during the study. Although the trial was designed to evaluate the protection against the original (Wuhan) strain, the Delta variant was the overwhelmingly dominant strain at study sites (Vietnam). In fact, the lower than estimated VE was expected, as several studies on approved vaccines reported a dramatic reduction VE against the Delta strain 7-9 . Secondly, the strict social distancing measures were imposed by the local (Vietnam) government during the first 3 months of the study, making VE analysis during this time frame challenging due to the limited number of Covid-19 cases. Because the efficacy/effectiveness decreases over time as shown by several studies on different Covid-19 vaccines 10-12 , the missing early efficacy window might have affected the overall efficacy observed during this study.
