            "text": "Severe acute respiratory tract syndrome following exposure to corona virus 2 (SARS COV-2) is responsible for viral pneumonia labeled as COVID-19 infection. It was first discovered in last month of 2019 1 , however due to highly infectious potential and presence of asymptomatic patients, it quickly transformed in to a pandemic. 2 People in more than 212 countries have reported exposure to this infection and confirmed reported cases are more than 65 million with more than 1.4 million deaths. 3 Covid-19 infection spreads either by direct contact with or inhalation of respiratory air droplets. Infected person can spread this disease either by touching infected hands on different surfaces from where healthy individuals are exposed to this virus by touching same surfaces and then touching their nose, mouth or eyes with infected hands or by shedding these viruses in air while sneezing or coughing. 4 These viruses in air droplets or aerosols can remain suspended in air for hours and may enter in healthy person with breathing, if in close proximity to infected individual. 5 Due to exponential spread of this highly infectious and lethal viral infection, routine clinical services including diagnostic and therapeutic procedures were immediately curtailed. 6 Many clinical procedures like nebulization, endotracheal intubation, bronchoscopy, open suctioning, ventilatory support, noninvasive positivepressure ventilation, tracheostomy and endoscopy are potentially aerosol generating procedures and can results in spread of this infection. 7 In addition to risk of transmission through infected aerosols being generated during procedure, in endoscopy room COVID-19 can also spread via direct person to person contact or while handling contaminated endoscopic equipment, accessories and body fluids. 8 Endoscopy suits are generally small, closed units where multiple persons including endoscopists, nursing staff, technician, anesthetist and hospital attendants are present. Patients with their attendants may stay in waiting rooms for many hours. Even a single patient of Covid-19 infection in this setting can contaminate suits air with viruses which may remain suspended in air for many hours. 9 Moreover, fecal shedding of virus in a patient further adds to the risk during colonoscopy. 10 Despite viral infection still rampant worldover even after more than nine months of being declared as pandemic by WHO, diagnostic and therapeutic endoscopic services have gradually resumed as was inevitable. In order to ensure safety of endoscopic staff during endoscopic procedures, GI societies have developed guidelines regarding patient screening, use of personal protective equipment (PPE) during procedures along with safety standards for handling of equipment and accessories. 11 Endoscopy staff is required to use face mask, gown, face or eye shield and head and foot covers during procedures with due care for following standard operating procedures (SOP) during donning and doffing of PPE. 6 However, efficacy of these measures in protecting endoscopy staff from COVID-19 infection still needs to be gauged and will only be known over time. We therefore planned an observational study to correlate compliance to PPE protocols and risk of SARS-COV-2 infection in endoscopy staff.",

Our center decided to start limited number of urgent procedures after developing Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for selection of patient for procedure, number of personals allowed in procedure room, PPE for endoscopist and procedure assistants. These SOPs were based on recommendation of American Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ASGE). 11 Every patient enrolled for endoscopy was stratified as High risk, Intermediate risk and low risk for Covid-19 infection based on: \u2022 Fever (Temperature > 37.5 C) in last 14 days \u2022 Exposure to family member or close contact with suspected or confirmed Covid-19 infection \u2022 Belongs to or has travelled to area with higher risk for Covid-19 infection in last 14 days Patients with none of these features were low risk, patients with fever alone or those with no fever but both exposures to suspected or confirmed patient and resident of high risk area were intermediate risk patients while patient with fever and one of other two features were high risk patients.",

            "text": "A survey from Italy reported only 1 out of 802 patients undergoing endoscopy to be Covid-19 positive on 2 weeks post-procedure follow up. They reported only 4.3% Covid-19 infections among endoscopy staff during these procedures. 18 We have noted 6.2% infection rate among endoscopy staff for 85 procedures at our center. Similarly, the SCOTS project has reported no Covid-19 infection in patients after two weeks of endoscopy with COVID-minimized pathway implementation. 19 In a study of more than 99,000 health care workers in UK and USA, it was estimated that health professionals have more than 10-fold risk of catching COVID-19 infection (HR 11.61, 95% CI 10.93-12.33) as compared to individuals in community. It was further concluded that adequacy of PPE can significantly curtail this risk. 20 However, effective implementation of these protective measures is needed to ensure safety of health professionals who as a community are struggling hard to continue quality healthcare delivery even during pandemic. 21 Limitations of the Study: We followed patients and endoscopy staff for symptoms of Covid-19 infection for 2 weeks post-procedure. As disease is also prevalent in community, study population can be exposed to virus outside endoscopy suit as well. Therefore, it is impossible to be certain that those infected, were exposed during endoscopy. We tested almost all patients undergoing procedure for Covid-19 infection 2 weeks after procedure but for endoscopy staff, PCR testing for infection was only performed for symptomatic individuals and it risks under-reporting of disease as a significant percentage of infected cases remain asymptomatic. Testing each staff member after procedure was not possible due to limited supply of testing kits in this pandemic and that too for screening. Our study lacks control group with no PPE during procedures, however it is not practical for a highly infectious and potentially lethal disease like Covid-19.",
