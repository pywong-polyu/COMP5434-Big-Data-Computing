So far over 63 million cases have been confirmed, resulting in almost 1.5 million deaths worldwide. 1 Mortality rates from COVID-19 are highest in elderly people. 2 Also people with diabetes mellitus have been identified to be at increased mortality risk. 2 Often no distinction is made between type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes. But as other risk factors for adverse outcomes of COVID-19 such as elderly age, obesity, hypertension and cardiovascular disease are very prevalent in type 2 diabetes, people with this diabetes subtype are considered to be at even higher risk. 3",

Such sudden and major disruptions in everyday life are known to influence both physical and mental health. 6 The alterations in behavioral patterns, daily life and exercise as well as increased feelings of stress and anxiety are all known to influence diabetes self-management and glycemic control. 7-14 Also a change in diabetes care by health professionals further increased the importance of adequate self-management behavior of people with diabetes mellitus. Thus, several factors coincided that challenged maintenance of glycemic control during the lockdown measures. It is unclear how the lockdown has a differential impact on people with type 1 and type 2 diabetes and whether the presence of additional risk factors for severe outcomes of COVID-19 in these people plays a role.",

This set consists of a small tube, a lancet and a return medical envelope. Via a fingerprick a small amount of capillary blood was collected in a tube by patients at home, which was then sent to the hospital laboratory by mail. 17 This is a validated and well-established measuring method for HbA1c analysis, providing identical results compared with HbA1c measurements in venous blood samples. 18 HbA1c 8-11 weeks (interval median (IQR) 65 (61-71) days) after the start of the lockdown period was compared with the last known HbA1c before 15 March 2020 (interval median (IQR) 178 (137-218) days before the start of the lockdown).",

Distress, as well as changes in daily structures and behavior, which were inevitable due to the lockdown period, are known to influence diabetes self-management and glycemic control. [7] [8] [9] [10] Adding to this challenge of maintaining glycemic control was the increased emphasis on diabetes self-management due to a shift to COVID-19 care and social distancing rules in hospitals, which led to Clinical care/Education/Nutrition cancellations of face-to-face consultations, and the use of telemedicine. The small overall improvement in HbA1c in people with type 1 diabetes (\u22120.16%) may be statistically significant but clinically not relevant. Together with an increase in scans of glucose sensors, these results indicate an increased focus on self-management. However, it should be noted that seasonal variation in glycemic control has been shown and higher temperatures are associated with lower HbA1c. 20 21 Thus, the small improvement in glycemic control could be due to a seasonal variation in our and other studies. Our results also indicate that the presence of more risk factors for a severe outcome of COVID-19, such as a higher BMI, cardiovascular comorbidities and hypertension, was not associated with stress, anxiety or change in HbA1c.",

We were able to assess changes in psychological stress, body weight and exercise providing important insight in participant's daily life during the lockdown period and knowledge about potential opportunities for improvement of diabetes care. The large study population allowed us to investigate these factors both in people with good and poor glycemic control, and we used both HbA1c and glucose monitoring data. For people with type 1 diabetes, our findings are in line with flash glucose monitoring data in a small group of 55 people, in which a small improvement in time in range and time above range was observed. 22 A limitation of the study is the reliance on self-reported data due to restricted access to health facilities during the lockdown period. Self-reported data about weight change are often an underestimation of the actual change in weight. 23 So the proportion of participants that increased in weight may be even larger. Furthermore, while HbA1c reflects glycemic control during the previous 3 months, the lockdown period had only been going on for 8-11 weeks at the time that the HbA1c measurement was performed and may underestimate the impact of lockdown on glycemic control. It should also be noted that Clinical care/Education/Nutrition most of the people with diabetes who participated in the study were relatively well controlled. In addition, most participants with type 2 diabetes used insulin. Therefore, the results are not representative for all people with diabetes, especially for people with type 2 diabetes as the majority of them do not need insulin treatment and are treated in primary care.",

People who experienced most difficulty with glycemic control also experienced more stress. Potentially, people with the poorest glycemic control may have put more emphasis on glycemic control in order to cope with the increased stress levels, ultimately improving their HbA1c values during the lockdown period.
