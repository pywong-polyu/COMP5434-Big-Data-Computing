Facing the possibility of resource precincts and healthcare rationing, leading dermatological and cancer societies acted expeditiously to adapt their guidelines to these contingencies. Melanoma is a lethal and aggressive skin cancer necessitating a multidisciplinary approach to management and is associated with significant healthcare and economic cost in later stages of disease. In revisiting how the pandemic transformed guidelines from diagnosis and surveillance to surgical and systemic management of melanoma, we appraise the evidence behind these decisions and their enduring implications.",

The treatment of advanced and metastatic melanoma requires a multidisciplinary team of specialists and multimodal regimens, with later stages of disease associated with significant healthcare and economic burden (1, 3) . Emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic broached an unprecedented need for judicious rationalization and allocation of healthcare resources worldwide (4) . In response, governing bodies released new guidelines on the management of melanoma in the COVID-19 era, shaped with a greater consciousness for minimizing patient exposure to infection and reducing healthcare consumption in mind. While in some geographical areas this has abated and vaccination rates are improving, new variants pose a risk to patients and healthcare delivery methods should variants evade the effectiveness of current vaccines. Here, we review these new guidelines, the evidence behind them and the potential implications of these recommendations as well as possible remedies.",

To date modifications of screening recommendations during the COVID pandemic have stemmed from theoretical concerns not directly from data on viral exposure or outcome data (5) . Thus, it is not clear that a change in current practice is yet warranted so long as safe patient care can be provided. The American Academy of Dermatology (AAD), the leading representative dermatological society in the United States, continues to advocate for routine screenings in their guidelines and their SPOT ME Skin Cancer campaign, with recommendations for in-person screenings in compliance with local and state Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines (6) .

Despite an increase in utilization of these services, 57% of total respondents recounted making zero diagnoses of melanoma, raising concerns for an increase in missed cases during this time (10) . On March 6, 2020, The National Comprehensive Cancer Center (NCCN) recommended that all new patients be evaluated with telehealth when possible, with a subsequent complete history and physical on the day of surgery if necessary (11). The goal, it would seem, was to reduce in-person exposure risks. A trade-off is if modification to a treatment plan is required when the patient arrives. Additionally, if telehealth is determined to be inferior for this purpose, as suggested by data, a future increase in delayed diagnoses or upstaged melanoma may occur (11). Aside from screening, diagnostic evaluations of an obvious, perhaps self-reported, lesion could be inaccurate through telemedicine. Further data collection to assess the accuracy of telemedicine compared with in-person diagnostic evaluation would be helpful in order to interpret recommendations for or against telehealth in this setting.",

Additionally, prospective results found inclusion of TBP and sequential digital dermoscopy imaging to surveillance protocols aided clinicians in detecting the majority of new lesions in high-risk patients (15) . Moreover, these outcomes are likely to be improved with the integration of artificial intelligence. Despite being in its nascent stages of development, diagnostic efficacy through machine learning have been comparable to that of trained clinicians, indicating these technical advances hold significant promise in enhancing the efficacy of image-based diagnostics (16) .",

The previous intention of restaging amidst adjuvant treatment was to ensure that the therapy is effective. Delaying that evaluation only continues to place the patient at risks and side-effects of the therapy without knowledge of its benefit.

However, in the absence of available adjuvant therapies, the British Association of Plastic and Reconstructive Aesthetic Surgeons (BAPRAS) considered lymphadenectomies a viable primary treatment for achieving local control for recurrent nodal disease (23) . For non-metastatic stage III melanoma, surgical resection should be performed 8-9 weeks following initiation of neoadjuvant therapy according to modified NCCN guidelines (11). Additionally, resections of metastatic stage III and IV disease should be deferred, unless the patient is critical or symptomatic, with continuation of systemic monotherapy instead (11). ESMO considered curative resections of stage III lesions, surgery for patients on neoadjuvant therapies, and management of surgical complications as high priority, but recognized delaying surgery is acceptable as it has not been shown to influence survival in many cases (22) .",

This seemed reasonable given that trial design which established adjuvant therapy allowed for this type of delay in most cases (42, 43) . Patients with high-risk stage III disease, defined as sentinel LN deposit >1 mm or stage >IIIa disease, are considered high to medium priority for adjuvant therapy according to ESMO (22) . In contrast, the BAPRAS only recommended adjuvant therapy in the setting of stage IIIc, IIId, and IV disease, but not in stage IIIa or IIIb cases (23) . Restricting adjuvant therapy by these guidelines appears arbitrary and undoubtedly will lead to a reversal in average OS gains. It also contradicts the aforementioned consideration of starting neoadjuvant therapy on advanced stage melanoma patients in order to briefly postpone surgery.",

Currently, there are no head to head trials comparing survival outcomes of adjuvant BRAF/MEK inhibitors with adjuvant ICIs for resected stage III melanomas (44) . In the COMBI-AD trial, patients treated with combination BRAF/MEK inhibitor therapy of dabrafenib plus trametinib had an estimated 58% relapse-free survival rate at 3 years, compared to 39% with placebo (45) . However, high rates of fever (63%) and chills (37%), as well as other flu-like symptoms associated with dabrafenib plus trametinib may make this combination counterintuitive (45) . Such symptoms amidst a viral pandemic could be confounding, leading to anxiety and increased in-person resource use. Comparably, KEYNOTE-054 showed patients with resected stage III melanoma treated with adjuvant pembrolizumab had a 64% relapse-free survival rate, compared to 44% in placebo group at 3-year median follow up (42) . Given that immunotherapy is not likely to cause fevers and chills, it is especially attractive at the present tine as an adjuvant strategy having similar efficacy on cross trial comparison to combination BRAF/MEK inhibitor therapy.",

            "text": "The COVID-19 pandemic swept in a period of uncertainty and forced clinicians to rethink the existing paradigms in treatment of melanoma to minimize both healthcare consumption and exposure. The unforeseen nature of the pandemic required societies to act quickly and swiftly to enact provisional guidelines and served as a catalyst for adapting new applications such as telemedicine into routine practice. A general impetus has been to limit patient exposure, reduce durable supply use and allow for redeployment of medical resources in a priority manner. How this will affect patient care will be the subject of review for years to come. The data generated during the pandemic to date is likely not robust enough to merit recommending long-term practice changes. Yet, despite the provisional nature of these guidelines, the COVID-19 pandemic highlighted many opportunities for optimization in our healthcare system. For instance telehealth may become more wide-spread and potentially could include software technology to assist in improving diagnostic accuracy. Neoadjuvant therapy, if appropriate, can defer surgery and operating room risks and resources, potentially until a pandemic has subsided or resources and PPI restocked. Systemic therapies have been scrutinized and compared to assess efficacy and side-effects. Clinical judgement on selecting these and the appropriate dose and schedule is still important. Despite best efforts some recommendations can be controversial in producing unintended consequences. As shown one recommending body may conflict with another. Hopefully ongoing efforts will provide input on cancer patient outcomes on and off therapy during this pandemic (46) . Until further evidence based data is available clinicians will be challenged to modify cancer care safely for their patients' welfare.",
