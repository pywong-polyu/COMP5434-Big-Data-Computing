Given the frequency with which they occur in the general pediatric population, as well as the prolonged period of shedding associated with many viruses, it is not surprising that these agents may pose a risk for transmission within the healthcare environment. This chapter will briefly review common and clinically significant viral pathogens with the potential for healthcare-associated transmission as well as infection control considerations related to these infections. In addition, isolation and containment procedures related to rare but highly virulent viral pathogens will be discussed.",

Respiratory virus nucleic acids were detected in 42% of samples taken from environmental surfaces in a children's hospital waiting room in one study [7] . The respiratory viruses of major importance to healthcare-associated infections are usually considered to include the paramyxoviruses (such as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV); parainfluenza viruses types 1, 2, 3, and 4; and human metapneumovirus); the orthomyxoviruses, including influenza A and B; the picornaviruses, some of which can be transmitted from the respiratory tract, such as rhinoviruses and respiratory enteroviruses; and the respiratory adenoviruses, of which there are many serotypes. Mimiviruses also may cause nosocomial pneumonia, especially in patients who are being mechanically ventilated in intensive care units. Respiratory virus infections may have potentially fatal consequences in children with hematologic malignancies or who have received bone marrow transplants. Therefore prompt isolation upon admission of patients with suspected respiratory viral infections, prior to confirmatory diagnosis, should be routine in healthcare centers to reduce nosocomial spread. In addition to contact precautions that have been traditionally recommended for many respiratory virus infections, enhanced isolation precautions (adding droplet precautions to contact precautions) have recently been shown to reduce the rate of nosocomial respiratory virus infections in pediatric hospitals and have now been adopted by many centers, especially bone marrow transplant units [1] . In such scenarios, caretakers wear gowns, gloves, and surgical masks during patient care encounters to reduce nosocomial spread of respiratory viruses. Therapy for the vast majority of respiratory viral infections in children, even in cases of hospital-acquired disease, is supportive with supplemental fluid and oxygen administered as needed and mechanical ventilation in cases of respiratory failure. Considerations related to specific viruses will be discussed below along with appropriate antiviral therapy when relevant.",

Infection with RSV may occur at any age, although it is most frequently diagnosed in the first 2 years of life. Reinfections with RSV may occur. It causes upper respiratory tract symptoms, such as rhinorrhea (often copious in nature), cough, and otitis media, as well as lower respiratory tract disease, such as bronchiolitis and pneumonia. In newborns or premature infants, apnea may be a presenting symptom. Most infections with RSV occur during the fall and early winter, but there are annual and regional differences to the start and finish of each RSV season. Most RSV infections are self-limited; however, infection may cause serious, even life-threatening disease in medically fragile patients, such as those with congenital heart disease, neuromuscular disease, and/or immunocompromised hosts. RSV is a common cause for medical visits in clinics, urgent care centers, and emergency centers, as well as hospitalization in acute care and intensive care units, providing ample opportunity for nosocomial transmission. Nosocomial outbreaks in pediatric wards, pediatric intensive care units, bone marrow transplant units, and neonatal intensive care units have been reported [8, 10, 11] and are associated with prolonged hospitalizations, prolonged time receiving mechanical ventilation, and even increased mortality.",

It also may aerosolize via large particle droplets and has been detected through molecular techniques in the air surrounding RSV-infected patients [14] , although droplet transmission is not felt to be as important a mode of transmission as contact transmission. It also can persist on environmental surfaces and hands. Healthcare-associated transmission from patient to healthcare worker often occurs via hand to nose or hand to eye self-inoculation after contact with contaminated secretions. Patients hospitalized with suspected or proven RSV infection should be cared for under standard and contact precautions (Table 14. 1), using gown and gloves, and rigorous hand hygiene. Some centers, especially bone marrow transplant units, will also use enhanced isolation precautions, and add droplet precautions, with healthcare workers wearing surgical masks during patient encounters [15] [16] [17] . In a quasi-experimental study in a children's hospital, the use of contact and droplet precautions was associated with a 39% reduction in nosocomial respiratory viral infections (including RSV) [1] . The use of eye goggles or face masks is not routinely recommended to reduce nosocomial transmission of RSV from patient to healthcare worker. Additional measures found to be helpful in some centers to minimize nosocomial spread of RSV include cohorting infants with suspected or proven RSV infection and excluding visitors with respiratory tract infections. [18] . In such patients, ribavirin may be administered in efforts to shorten the duration and lessen the severity of disease [19] . Diagnosis of PIV infection can be suspected with reasonable certainty if a pediatric patient presents with a croup-like illness during the appropriate seasonal time period. It can be confirmed using traditional viral culture, direct immunofluorescence, or utilizing molecular diagnostics available in larger hospitals and reference laboratories.",

Many hospitals will enforce droplet precautions at the time of admission, for all patients presenting with ILI, until the cause can be established through appropriate diagnostic testing. During the 2009 influenza A (H1N1) pandemic, infection control recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention included the use of N95 respirators for healthcare workers caring for patients with suspected pandemic influenza, in addition to contact and droplet precautions. Realistically, however, many institutions had difficulty complying with these enhanced isolation precautions, either due to unavailability of N95 respirators, poor tolerability, work flow concerns, or patient volume, among other reasons. In addition, to their impact on individual patient symptoms, antiviral agents have a role in the prevention of spread of influenza within a hospital unit. Prompt antiviral therapy with oseltamivir or zanamivir for children hospitalized with ILI or confirmed influenza virus infections has been shown to reduce nosocomial spread of influenza by reducing viral shedding in infected patients [24] . Oseltamivir resistance may emerge during prolonged antiviral treatment of hospitalized immunocompromised hosts who have persistent and prolonged viral shedding while receiving antiviral therapy. Routine immunization of all healthcare workers with the seasonal influenza vaccine, prior to the beginning of the influenza season, is also recommended (and even mandatory in many hospitals) to reduce healthcare worker-to-patient transmission of infection.",

In one study, 37% of environmental samples taken from a children's hospital waiting room in the winter had evidence of adenovirus [7] , highlighting the potential for this virus to persist in the environment. Nosocomial outbreaks in pediatric wards, bone marrow transplant units, intensive care units, ophthalmology clinics, and neonatal intensive care units have been documented [34, 35] . Medical devices, such as eye specula (blepharostat) used to examine the eyes of newborns and preterm infants at risk for retinopathy of prematurity in the nurseries and neonatal intensive care units, have also been linked to nosocomial outbreaks [34] . In addition, tonometer prisms used in ophthalmology clinics may be a source of ADV infection after eye exams [36] . Given this notable risk of infection transmission, singleuse eye specula and tonometers are preferred if available. Autoclave sterilization is the preferred method of sterilization of reusable eyelid specula between neonate examinations. However, if autoclave use is not available or will damage the instrument, washing the specula with chlorhexidine gluconate or dilute bleach (sodium hypochlorite) in between examinations may be more effective than cleaning with an alcohol swab [37] [38] [39] . Patients in the healthcare setting with suspected or proven ADV infections should be cared for under standard, contact, and droplet precautions. In addition, rigorous hand hygiene with soap and water or an alcohol-based hand rub should be enforced and environmental surfaces should be disinfected frequently [40] . Notably, one laboratorybased study found that alcohol-based solutions in hand sanitizers may not be effective against some strains of adenovirus [36] .",

Molecular techniques have also detected VZV DNA in the air surrounding patients with varicella zoster infections (chicken pox and zoster) [54] . Transmission from respiratory droplets is thought to be much less common. Nosocomial transmission of VZV infections is well documented in the healthcare setting (especially pediatric wards), and healthcare-associated outbreaks, sometimes with fatal outcomes in immunocompromised hosts, may occur [55, 56] . Patients hospitalized with chicken pox or disseminated zoster (or immunocompromised patients with simple zoster who may be at risk for dissemination) should be isolated in a private room equipped with a separate exhaust system and negative pressure air relative to the hallway, if such rooms are available [50] . They should also, in addition to standard precautions, be cared for with contact and airborne precautions. Isolation should continue until no new lesions occur, and all lesions that have occurred are completely crusted over. In addition, nonimmune patients in the hospital setting who have been exposed to varicella should also be isolated under airborne and contact precautions for 8-21 days after exposure (and up to 28 days after exposure if VariZIG or IVIG were received as postexposure immunoprophylaxis) if they require ongoing hospitalization. Newborns born to mothers with varicella at the time of delivery should also be isolated and cared for under contact and airborne precautions while hospitalized (or until 21 days of age or 28 days if immunoglobulin is provided). Normal patients with localized zoster may not require special isolation with airborne and contact precautions if the zoster lesions are able to be completely covered. However, some hospital infection control officers may prefer to isolate even immunocompetent patients with localized zoster under airborne precautions and, if available, place them in a negative pressure room, especially if they are roomed near immunocompromised patients.",

The HPVs of nosocomial transmission interest are primarily those low risk, cutaneous types 6 and 11, which cause oral or cutaneous warts, laryngeal papillomas, and juvenile respiratory papillomatosis. The latter is a chronic disease of the respiratory tract that often requires repeated surgical procedures or photoangiolytic laser treatments to alleviate long-term stenotic complications in the airways. Oral warts and oropharyngeal cancers caused by HPV types 16 and 18 also may require laser/electrosurgery procedures. These procedures may generate laser plumes, aerosols, or smoke that may contain HPV virus particles and therefore are a potential risk for healthcare workers. The risk of inhalation of potentially infectious aerosols that may be generated during the procedure can be mitigated by performing the procedures in a well-ventilated room, while using localized smoke evacuator exhaust ventilation, and wearing of N95 respirators during the procedure [68] . Reports also exist of HPV contamination of improperly sterilized gynecologic instruments and vaginal ultrasound probes [69, 70] .

Patients who are critically ill and intubated, have extensive burns, or are immunocompromised may experience a reactivation of HSV infection and may develop oropharyngeal or cutaneous herpetic lesions. As such, it is not uncommon for patients to experience HSV reactivation and recurrent disease while in the hospital. Alternatively, physiologic stress may induce laboratory detectable HSV reactivation without overt disease [71] . Up to 14% of patients with septic shock develop HSV reactivation with transient viremia, although the clinical significance of this is a bit unclear [72, 73] . Primary corneal graft failure has also been reported due to reactivation of latent corneal HSV in donor tissue following corneal transplantation [74] . Nosocomial outbreaks with HSV have been reported in eye clinics. Antiviral treatment with acyclovir or valacyclovir is commonly used for active HSV disease, suppression of HSV infection after successful treatment, or prevention of reactivation HSV infection. The antivirals ganciclovir, valganciclovir, foscarnet, and cidofovir also have activity against HSV and are second-line antivirals for HSV treatment.",

During procedures in patients with known or suspected prion disease, protective measures should include a minimum of healthcare workers in the operating room, covering all non-disposable, multiple-use instruments, employing single-use equipment whenever possible, unidirectional flow of instruments, disposal of all single-use items by incineration, and thorough cleaning of all work surfaces.",

Incineration is probably the most effective means of decontamination; however, some experts feel thorough cleaning with concentrated bleach or sodium hydroxide for an hour, followed by prolonged autoclaving, may be sufficient to decrease infectivity of prion-contaminated surgical instruments. Special handling for autopsy and body remains should also be followed. The WHO has detailed infection control guidelines and practices for prion infection [93] .",
