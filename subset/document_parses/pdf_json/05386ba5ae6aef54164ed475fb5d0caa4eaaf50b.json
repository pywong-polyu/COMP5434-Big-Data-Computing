As their vulnerability to become infected remains uncertain, we assessed the seroreactivity for SARS-CoV-2 to estimate the prevalence of infection and possible phenotypic and socioeconomic determinants for their contagion. Serologic evaluation was performed on 135 patients with an overall prevalence of 11%; positivity was associated with older age and use of public transportation. We speculate that social distancing instructions recommended by our clinic may have contributed to lower levels of infection, but potential protection factors need further investigation.",

Therefore, interesting approaches have emerged, such as less bureaucracy in the dispensation of hydroxyurea and the occupation of secondary hospital beds that were not referenced for COVID assistance, for more immediate and personalized care. All these measures, taken together, provided less exposure for patients and maximized their social isolation, certainly contributing to a lower vulnerability to SARS-CoV-2 infection than initially projected. Therefore, we must emphasize that the lower availability of population testing in our country no doubt leads to a lower acknowledgment of cases. However, despite this fact, we were able to demonstrate that some patients had COVID-19 in such a benign form that they did not seek medical atten- ",

The blood donor pool comes from the same geographic area and is, therefore, a comparable parameter. The fact that there was little difference between the seroprevalence of antibodies between a population apt for blood donation (hence healthy individuals) and an SCD patient cohort with high rates of comorbidities suggests that the social distancing instructions given to patients by our SCD clinic throughout the pandemic may have contributed to lower levels of SARS-CoV-2 infection in our cohort, given the patients' compliance to social distancing measures attested by the surveys. The fact that only one patient at our center had severe disease during the study period agrees with other reports showing less severity for SCD than initially expected[10], which raises the question regarding protection factors in these patients, or at least may rule out an increased risk for severe diseasein this specific population. In fact, the transient positivity of serological tests and the low levels of functional neutralizing antibodies in SCD patients may indicate the acquisition of protective immune responses that are not dependent on antibodies and that remain to be better evaluated. This is the first article that accesses seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in SCD population. Therefore, we do not have parameters to access comparatively the pattern of antibody titers and duration of serologic positivity in this specific population. Studies in the general population have attested that, even in a broader spectrum of patients, the duration of antibody rise is still not completely elucidated [11] and more research is imperative in this area. It can be questioned if hydroxyurea could have been a protective factor against COVID-19 infection, since 66% of patients were under therapy with the drug. Among the overall 15 patients with positive results for COVID-19 antibodies, 10 were in use of hydroxyurea. In fact, Minniti et al. [10] have pointed hydroxyurea use as a protective factor against death in their cohort of SCD patients with COVID-19. Unfortunately, subsequently to the end of the study in January 2021, there was an upsurge of the pandemic in the country, with high prevalence of the P1 variant. Despite not having the serologic results of the patients in the period between January and April, only one patient was hospitalized due to COVID-19 diagnosis in this period. The patient was a 56-year-old male with a critical phenotype (repeating acute chest syndrome episodes) and hypertension. He progressed to death after 3 weeks of mechanical ventilation. Therefore, we understand that even with the new variant, notwithstanding specific serological evaluation, there has not been a significant increase in our patients' infection rates or disease severity.
