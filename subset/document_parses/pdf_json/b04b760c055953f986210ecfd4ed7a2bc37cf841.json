A realistic assessment of the situation is necessary to utilize resources optimally and appropriately. In this research, we perform Covid-19 tweets sentiment analysis using a supervised machine learning approach. Identification of Covid-19 sentiments from tweets would allow informed decisions for better handling the current pandemic situation. The used dataset is extracted from Twitter using IDs as provided by the IEEE data port. Tweets are extracted by an in-house built crawler that uses the Tweepy library. The dataset is cleaned using the preprocessing techniques and sentiments are extracted using the TextBlob library. The contribution of this work is the performance evaluation of various machine learning classifiers using our proposed feature set. This set is formed by concatenating the bag-of-words and the term frequency-inverse document frequency. Tweets are classified as positive, neutral, or negative. Performance of classifiers is evaluated on the accuracy, precision, recall, and F 1 score. For completeness, further investigation is made on the dataset using the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) architecture of the deep learning model. The results show that Extra Trees Classifiers outperform all other models by achieving a 0.93 accuracy score using our proposed concatenated features set. The LSTM achieves low accuracy as compared to machine learning classifiers. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed feature set, the results are compared with the Vader sentiment analysis technique based on the GloVe feature extraction approach.",

During the lock-down, traffic on social networking has increased tremendously [5] . Twitter has outclassed other competitors in the timely spreading of Covid-19 news [6] . Overwhelming part of these news is subjective due to the involvement of personal opinions and biasness, hence giving rise to (un)intentional fake information, uncertainty, and negativity in human social circles [7] . At the same time, this situation is catching the attention of researchers to perform computable analysis for creating a wholesome picture. This research focuses on sentiment analysis on Twitter dataset regarding Covid-19 using supervised machine learning algorithms. To this end, we undertake the following research questions: RQ 1: How is the performance comparison of machine learning models for Covid-19 sentiment analysis on tweets?",

Next sentiment scores are found using the TextBlob toolkit. These scores are classified as positive, negative and neutral.

For feature extraction, techniques such as term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF), bag-of-words (BoW) and GloVe are used. We propose a feature technique by concatenating TF-IDF and BoW features.

Another study mines a database for over 1 million tweets of five months in 2020 to assess public attitude regarding the preventative measure of mask usage during the COVID-19 pandemic [24] . It is also based on NLP and determines the frequency increase of mask-related positive tweets. Sentiment analysis is also carried out on a set of 26000 tweets in two time intervals: 1st Jan 2019 to 23rd March 2020 and December 2019 to May 2020 [25] . The set includes re-tweets. Tweets within the first interval have mostly neutral and negative polarity, while those within the second interval has neutral and positive polarity. The used classifier is based on deep learning that achieved 81% accuracy.",

The only difference between ETC and RF is the way trees are constructed in the forest.

At each test node, each tree is provided with a random sample of k features drawn from the feature-set. Each decision tree must select the best feature to split the data based on some mathematical criteria (typically Gini Index). This random sample of features leads to the creation of multiple de-correlated decision trees. We use ETC with two main parameters, n_estimators = 300 and max_depth = 300, as given in Table 5 .",

Next, a dropout layer with a 0.5 dropout rate is used to drop the neurons during training, thus reducing the chances of over-fitting the model. The output layer with the sigmoid function is used to find the probability of each class. Our LSTM model shows poor performance on the selected dataset by attaining an accuracy score of 0.577. This poor performance is due to the fact that the dataset is too small for a deep learning model. This is in accordance with the study that reports the poor performance of deep learning models on small datasets [39, 58] . We also used the BiLSTM [59] and CNN-LSTM [57] and achieved the accuracy score of 0.579 and 0.61 reflectively. BiLSTM and CNN-LSTM take more training time as compared to LSTM but does not give much improvement.
