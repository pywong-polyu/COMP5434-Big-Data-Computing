Thousands of dogs were taken ill. The epidemic was suspected to be canine parvoviral enteritis and therefore feces and serum samples were submitted to virological examination. The rapid diagnosis was favored following CARMICHAEL'S procedure of detecting the CPV hemagglutinin in feces and the antihemagglutinin in serum (6) . To this we added electron microscopy and immune electron microscopy of particles in fecal samples, immunodiffusion and counterimmunoelectrophoresis. The present report is a summary of experience using these procedures. ",

In the tests described below, the fecal samples were used as supernatants ' of $0 'to PO Olio suspensions in PBS-D (see below) after centrifugation a t 16,300 x g. and 4 OC. If necessary, the supernatants were kept at -70 OC until tested. The identity of the virus present in feces was also verified by ID using an HA-positive sample, the reference CPV strain and the reference antiserum (Fig. 2) . In the original method of double diffusion only one precipitation line was formed (Fig. 2) . In WADSWORTH'S micromethod there were one very faint and two strong lines of identity (not shown), announcing the presence of three antigens. Three polypeptides are known to belong to the protein of some parvoviruses, e. g. the virus of feline panleukopenia (9). For routine diagnosis of CPV in the feces, the ID-test and counterimmunoelectrophoresis were found to be insensitive, i. e., only five of a total of 54 samples were positive in both these tests (data not shown). In one of the positive fecal samples we also found, by EM, reovirus-like particles. In three further sam les, one from a healthy bitch and two from its two diseased puppies, so-callecf \"fringed\" particles were seen in the absence of parvovirus-like particles. The \"fringed\" particles were similar to those observed in feces of calves with diarrhea (10, 11). Enterovirus-like particles were also seen in some samples; they were larger than parvovirus particles. Finally, Campylobacter spp were cultivated from about 60 O/o of fecal samples examined from hospital B (SANDSTEDT and HURVELL, personal communication).",

However, using this procedure the percentage of positive dogs was low when compared with that detected by EM, i. e., 25.9 versus 48.3 O/o. On the other hand, in several samples the number of viral particles might have been too small to give HA or the particles to be identified as CPV by immunoaggregation. The presence of another parvovirus of dogs, the MCV (3) instead of CPV, is conceivable. Besides, in many routine laboratories an electron microscope is not available. The procedure of cultivating the CPV from feces in cell cultures proved to be time-consuming and unreliable (data not shown).",
