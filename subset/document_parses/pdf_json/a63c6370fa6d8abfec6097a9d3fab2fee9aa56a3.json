Propaganda, in the form we know it today, can be dated back to the beginning of the 17th century. However, it is with the advent of the Internet and the social media that it has started to spread on a much larger scale than before, thus becoming major societal and political issue. Nowadays, a large fraction of propaganda in social media is multimodal, mixing textual with visual content. With this in mind, here we propose a new multi-label multimodal task: detecting the type of propaganda techniques used in memes. We further create and release a new corpus of 950 memes, carefully annotated with 22 propaganda techniques, which can appear in the text, in the image, or in both. Our analysis of the corpus shows that understanding both modalities together is essential for detecting these techniques. This is further confirmed in our experiments with several state-of-the-art multimodal models.",

In the current information ecosystem, it has evolved to computational propaganda (Woolley and Howard, 2018; Martino et al., 2020) , where information is distributed through technological means to social media platforms, which in turn make it possible to reach well-targeted communities at high velocity.

There have also been notable datasets developed, including (i) TSHP-17 (Rashkin et al., 2017) , which consists of document-level annotation labeled with four classes (trusted, satire, hoax, and propaganda); (ii) QProp (Barr\u00f3n-Cedeno et al., 2019) , which uses binary labels (propaganda vs. non-propaganda), and (iii) PTC (Da San Martino et al., 2019), which uses fragment-level annotation and an inventory of 18 propaganda techniques. While that work has focused on text, here we aim to detect propaganda techniques from a multimodal perspective. This is a new research direction, even though large part of propagandistic social media content nowadays is multimodal, e.g., in the form of memes. Memes are popular in social media as they can be quickly understood with minimal effort (Diresta, 2018) . They can easily become viral, and thus it is important to detect malicious ones quickly, and also to understand the nature of propaganda, which can help human moderators, but also journalists, by offering them support for a higher level analysis. Figure 1 shows some examples of memes 1 and propaganda techniques. Example (a) applies transfer, using symbols (hammer and sickle) and colors (red), that are commonly associated with communism, in relation to the two Republicans shown in the image; it also uses Name Calling (traitors, Moscow Mitch, Moscow's bitch). The meme in (b) uses both Smears and Glittering Generalities. The one in (c) expresses Smears and suggest that Joe Biden's campaign is only alive because of mainstream media. The examples in the second row show some less common techniques. Example (d) uses Appeal to authority to give credibility to a statement that rich politicians are crooks, and there is also a Thought-terminating clich\u00e9 used to discourage critical thought on the statement in the form of the phrase \"WE KNOW\", thus implying that the Clintons are crooks, which is also Smears.",

The current information ecosystem and virality tools, such as bots, enable memes to spread easily, jumping from one target group to another. As of present, attempts to limit the spread of such memes have focused on analyzing social networks and looking for fake accounts and bots to reduce the spread of such content (Cresci et al., 2017; Yang et al., 2019; Chetan et al., 2019; Pacheco et al., 2020) .",

Rashkin et al. (2017) developed the TSHP-17corpus, which uses document-level annotation and is labeled with four classes: trusted, satire, hoax, and propaganda. TSHP-17 was developed using distant supervision, i.e., all articles from a given news outlet share the label of that outlet. The articles were collected from the English Gigaword corpus and from seven other unreliable news sources. Among them two were propagandistic. They trained a model using word n-gram representation with logistic regression and reported that the model performed well only on articles from sources that the system was trained on. Barr\u00f3n-Cedeno et al. (2019) developed a new corpus, QProp , with two labels: propaganda vs. non-propaganda. They also experimented on TSHP-17 and QProp corpora, where for the TSHP-17 corpus, they binarized the labels: propaganda vs. any of the other three categories.",

On top of this work, they proposed a multi-granular deep neural network that captures signals from the sentence-level task and helps to improve the fragment-level classifier.

Volkova et al. (2019) proposed models for detecting misleading information using images and text. They developed a corpus of 500,000 Twitter posts consisting of images labeled with six classes: disinformation, propaganda, hoaxes, conspiracies, clickbait, and satire. Then, they modeled textual, visual, and lexical characteristics of the text. Glenski et al. (2019) explored multilingual multimodal content for deception detection. They had two multi-class classification tasks: (i) classifying social media posts into four categories (propaganda, conspiracy, hoax, or clickbait), and (ii) classifying social media posts into five categories (disinformation, propaganda, conspiracy, hoax, or clickbait).",

The motivation for multilabel annotation is that the content in the memes often expresses multiple techniques, even though such a setting adds complexity both in terms of annotation and of classification. We also chose to consider annotating spans because the propaganda techniques can appear in the different chunk(s), which is also in line with recent research (Da San Martino et al., 2019). We could not consider annotating the visual modality independently because all memes contain the text as part of the image. The annotation team included six members, both female and male, all fluent in English, with qualifications ranging from undergrad, to MSc and PhD degrees, including experienced NLP researchers; this helped to ensure the quality of the annotation. No incentives were provided to the annotators. The annotation process required understanding the textual and the visual content, which poses a great challenge for the annotator. Thus, we divided it into five phases, as discussed below and as shown in Figure 2 . Among these phases there were three stages, (i) pilot annotations to train the annotators to recognize the propaganda techniques, (ii) independent annotations by three annotators for each meme (phase 2 and 4), (iii) consolidation (phase 3 and 5), where the annotators met with the other three team members, who acted as consolidators, and all six discussed every single example in detail (even those for which there was no disagreement).",

The number of words ranges between 1 and 73 words, with an average of 17.79\u00b111.60. In our analysis, we observed that some propaganda techniques were more textual, e.g., Loaded Language and Name Calling, while others, such as Transfer, tended to be more imagerelated. Table 2 shows the number of instances of each technique when using unimodal (text only, i.e., after phase 3) vs. multimodal (text + image, i.e., after phase 5) annotations. Note also that a total of 36 memes had no propaganda technique annotated. We can see that the most common techniques are Smears, Loaded Language, and Name calling/Labeling, covering 63%, 51%, and 36% of the examples, respectively. These three techniques also form the most common pairs and triples in the dataset as shown in Table 3 . We further show the distribution of the number of propaganda techniques per meme in Figure 3 . We can see that most memes contain more than one technique, with a maximum of 8 and an average of 2.61. Table 2 shows that the techniques can be found both in the textual and in the visual content of the meme, thus suggesting the use of multimodal learning approaches to effectively exploit all information available. Note also that different techniques have different span lengths. For example, Loaded Language is about two words long, e.g., violence, mass shooter, and coward. However, techniques such as Whataboutism need much longer spans with an average length of 22 words. ",

Since we are dealing with a multi-class multi-label task, where the labels are imbalanced, we chose micro-average F 1 as our main evaluation measure, but we also report macroaverage F 1 . We used the Multimodal Framework (MMF) (Singh et al., 2020). We trained all models on Tesla P100-PCIE-16GB GPU with the following manually tuned hyper-parameters (on dev): batch size of 32, early stopping on the validation set optimizing for F1-micro, sequence length of 128, AdamW as an optimizer with learning rate of 5e-5, epsilon of 1e-8, and weight decay of 0.01. All reported results are averaged over three runs with random seeds. The average execution time for BERT was 30 minutes, and for the other models it was 55 minutes. Table 4 shows the results for the models in Section 5.1. Rows 1 and 2 show a random and a majority class baseline, respectively. Rows 3-5 show the results for the unimodal models. While they all outperform the baselines, we can see that the model based on visual modality only, i.e., ResNet-152 (row 3), performs worse than models based on text only (rows 4-5). This might indicate that identifying the techniques in the visual content is a harder task than in texts. Moreover, BERT significantly outperforms fastText, which is to be expected as it can capture contextual representation better.",

This makes sense as late fusion is a simple mean of the results of each modality, while early fusion has a more complex architecture and trains a separate multi-layer perceptron for the visual and for the textual features. We can also see that both mid-fusion models (rows 7-8) improve over the corresponding textonly ones (rows 3-5). Finally, looking at the results in rows 9-11, we can see that each multimodal model consistently outperforms each of the unimodal models (rows 1-8). The best results are achieved with ViLBERT CC (row 10) and Visual-BERT COCO (row 11), which use complex representations that combine the textual and the visual modalities. Overall, we can conclude that multimodal approaches are necessary to detect the use of propaganda techniques in memes, and that pretrained transformer models seem to be the most promising approach.",

When the meme is a screenshot of a social network account, e.g., WhatsApp, the user name and login can be removed as well as all Like, Comment, and Share elements.2. Remove the text related to logos that are not part of the main text.3. Remove all text related to figures and tables.4. Remove all text that is partially hidden by an image, so that the sentence is almost impossible to read.5. Remove text that is not from the meme, but on banners and billboards carried on by demonstrators, street advertisements, etc.6. Remove the author of the meme if it is signed.7. If the text is in columns, first put all text from the first column, then all text from the next column, etc.8. Rearrange the text, so that there is one sentence per line, whenever possible.",
