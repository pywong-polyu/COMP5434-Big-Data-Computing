Over 90% of the patients with HFpEF are \u226560 years old [6] at the time of diagnosis, and as life expectancy increases the public-health impact of HFpEF is likely to follow the same escalating trend.",

Readmission rates increase in parallel with the average number of days spent in the hospital during the initial hospitalization for acute HFpEF [10] . The complex pathophysiology of HFpEF, the heterogeneity of the patient population, and a large number of comorbidities at the age of onset could explain the limited number of therapeutic options and the poor response to treatment. Both US and European HF guidelines have highlighted the importance of recognizing and managing multiple comorbidities, adjusting treatment to the patient phenotype [4, 11] . Furthermore, there is an urgent need to identify predictors and trends of HFpEF readmission, as an initial step towards the personalized management of this specific group of patients.",

We computed the possibility of predicting the HFR at six months by comparing AUROC of the training cohort and validation cohort (see Figure 6 ).

Our finding that LVOT VTI is a determinant of HFR, with higher values predicting HFR, is in contrast with a recent study of Omote et al. which associated a lower value with a worse outcome [26] . However, Omote et.al used a composite index (all-cause mortality and HFR) and followed the patients in the long-term. The present study focused on the first six months, and the outcome was HFR alone, not a composite index. Our data show that early on in the evolution of HFpEF, a slightly higher LVOT VTI is associated with more hospitalizations. This might indicate that, in the course of the disease, LVOT VTI does not show a linear decline. After an initial adaptative rise, linked to an increased left ventricular mass and increased filling pressures associated with more hospitalizations, the LVOT VTI starts to decline and the prognosis is worse in the long term. The higher ventricular mass is explained in part by the fact that 100% of our study population was hypertensive, thus explaining a worse relaxation profile.",
