With air pollution as a potential transmission vector there is need to include it in intervention strategies. We propose a U-net driven quantile regression model to predict P M 2.5 air pollution based on easily obtainable satellite imagery. We demonstrate that our approach can reconstruct P M 2.5 concentrations on ground-truth data and predict reasonable P M 2.5 values with their spatial distribution, even for locations where pollution data is unavailable. Such predictions of P M 2.5 characteristics could crucially advise public policy strategies geared to reduce the transmission of and lethality of COVID-19.",

Of particular interest are the questions of transmission methods, and characteristics that identify vulnerable populations. Studies into these properties are made more complex by the lack of information around the behavior of the virus, E.g. the percent of cases that are asymptomatic. However, as indicated by the inclusion in the CDC's vulnerable Population index, asthma and chronic lung disease seem to be a major factor in the severity of the cases. For example, in (Conticini et al., 2020) the connections between the lethality rate in Lombardy and Emilia Romagna, areas with high level of atmospheric pollution, are explored. In particular, the paper studies the correlation between pollution, which is a known instigator of chronic lung disease even in young and other wise healthy subjects, and the lethality of SARS-CoV-2. A similar result for the lethality in the United States (Wu et al., 2020) using county level fatality rate, and county level long term air pollution, shows that, after adjusting for other known factors, that there is a strong correlation between the concentration of particulate matter 2.5 micrometers or less in diameter, or P M 2.5 , and the county level lethality. Specifically, a 1 \u00b5g m 3 increase in P M 2.5 corresponds to an 8% increase in the fatality rate.",

However, the spatial resolution of these measurements is greatly limited by the sparsity of sensor networks. Thus, detailed pollution maps have been developed that integrate heterogeneous data sources (see e.g. van Donkelaar et al. (2019)), to create a database of estimated monthly pollutant concentrations over several countries. This data was used by Wu et al. (2020) linking P M 2.5 concentrations to COVID-19 mortality rates. Although this historical data helped establish this causality relationship, up-to-date/live pollution information is still needed to monitor pollutant P M 2.5 . By knowing where pollution is we can better understand the impacts of social segregation policy on subpopulations in order to e.g. allocate medical funds to the most vulnerable populaces. The health needs for a population often require very granular data about their circumstances, and air pollution is one such measure that is only sporadically known in poorer areas and thus is insufficiently represented in modeling the health situation. In order to properly control COVID-19 hotspots there is a need to predict the spread and intensity of COVID-19. While contact tracing and non- pharmacological interventions (NPIs) have shown value, there is mounting evidence that there are other transmission vectors, including via pollution particles, as discussed earlier. Therefore there is mounting need to understand local pollution dynamics in order to correctly deal with the pandemic. In order to properly understand the effectiveness of a given NPI it is essential we understand the main transmission vectors. It is, therefore, vital we gain understanding of the strength of air pollution as a transmission vector in order to understand and design NPIs efficiently.",

Since its introduction in 2015, the U-net has been successfully applied to various semantic segmentation tasks, E.g. in medical imaging (Dong et al., 2017) and astronomy (Akeret et al., 2017) . The U-net consists of two symmetrical parts. The encoder path downsamples the original image into meaningful features by means of convolutional filters and pooling operations, whereas the upsampling path aims at decoding these features into a full-sized output map using transposed convolution operations, driven by an appropriate loss function. Moreover, upsampling layers are augmented with feature maps from the downsampling path at the corresponding resolution, to provide more context information. The original U-net was meant for classification and featured a softmax layer after the top-level upsampling layer's output, trained using a cross-entropy objective with discrete ground-truth labels. Yet the U-net has also been used for dense regression by removing the softmax layer and optimizing the squared difference between the upsampled output and a continuous target variable (Yao et al., 2018; Payer et al., 2016) .",

This might pose a challenge to gradient-based optimization schemes (E.g. back propagation in neural networks) because the gradient norm does not get smaller as the optimization converges to a local minimum. To alleviate that, some approximations of the check function have been proposed.

Next, we defined our ground-truth data as these images paired with corresponding P M 2.5 images from which we use an 80:20% random split to create training/testing set of 106:27 images. A U-net based on adapting the implementation by Akeret et al. (2017) was trained using an ADAM optimized over 1000 epochs with minibatch size of 15 and 100 internal iterations, with the following parameterization: dropout ratio was 0.5, learning rate 0.00005, regression quantiles q l = 0.1, q r = 0.9. For the Huber loss function (3), all aggregates (2) contributed in equal proportion and the parameter controlling the function shape was \u03b1 = 2. 4.1: Sanity check with ground-truth. The network converged to a state which produced a mean absolute error of \u2248 1\u00b5g/m 3 between predicted and ground-truth values on the training set (see Fig. 4 ). The median width of the predicted confidence intervals (upper bound -lower bound) for training data was 1.94\u00b5g/m 3 , and 70% of ground-truth values fell into the predicted interval. The number of groundtruth values above the lower bound and below the upper bound was respectively 88% and 82%. This demonstrates that the model was able to approximate the 0.1 and 0.9 quantiles well, and also to provide quality point-estimates. Correspondingly, our approach can predict P M 2.5 pollution where the U-net was generalized to cities at times not present in the training data but locations it has been trained on. Error with the GT data converges to M AE \u2248 1 and the error with validation data converges to M AE \u2248 2. This shows that the U-net can generalize well to temporally novel data. maps that match the structure and approximate concentrations of ground-truth reconstructions. See Fig. 5 for some examples.",

To assess the ability of our model to generalize in the temporal domain, we utilized 27 previously unseen images that overlapped with the training set spatially but not temporally. The test set contained images from 15 of the 24 cities. The mean absolute validation error followed the same trend as Exp. 4.1 with GT training data, however it converged to about 2\u00b5g/m 3 (see Fig. 4 ). The performance of the predicted confidence intervals degraded to 40% of contained ground-truth values, whereas the median interval width remained low at 2.06\u00b5g/m 3 . This indicates a degree of overfitting, however the predicted P M 2.5 concentrations are still within reasonable distance of the ground-truth.",

We applied the U-net learned in Exp. 4.3 to satellite images of Los Angeles, CA from 2018, 2019, and early 2020. The results, shown in Fig. 6 , illustrate that the U-net was able to learn P M 2.5 concentrations consistent with world events at the time. Namely, the pollution is inferred to be notably higher before the lock-down than after the lock-down, shown by the considerable shift of the predicted P M 2.5 distribution's 0.9 quantile between October 2019 and April 2020 -the quantile shifted from 13.2 to 9.7, respectively. Additionally, our approach was able to successfully isolate regions in LA that are the most densely populated by predicting higher pollutant P M 2.5 values. This suggests that our approach can generalize to new data and reliably predict pollutant P M 2.5 concentrations and their spatial structure, which informs on the presence and lethality of SARS-CoV-2.",

We have proposed a means of learning the structure, spatial distribution, and physical concentration of pollutant particulate matter P M 2.5 based solely on global satellite imagery and monthly P M 2.5 values from the years 2013-2018. Our approach proposes a U-net convolutional network with quantile regression loss to learn dense per-pixel P M 2.5 prediction maps. We have demonstrated not only that our approach can successfully reconstruct P M 2.5 concentrations with low error, but it can also generalize to completely unseen locations for which pollutant data is not available. As pollution has been shown to be a main vector of SARS-CoV-2 transmission, this ability to identify regions where it may be particularly transmissible and lethal can provide critical advice to implementable public health strategies, such as the ability to monitor, understand, and design NPIs efficiently.",

Additionally, although we currently do not have rigorous methodology to quantify what makes satellite imagery of different cities 'similar', we could address this e.g. with dependence tests such as kernel two-sample tests (Gretton et al., 2012) . Also, data from multiple satellites could be included to provide greater temporal resolution, such as from the Sentinel-2 mission (Drusch et al., 2012) . With larger satellite datasets we can expect an increase in the accuracy of our predictions.",

As expected, we see a significant reduction in the 0.9-quantile of the predicted P M2.5 pollution distributions between April 2020 (immediately after the lock-down began) and the previous years. The predicted P M2.5 maps match this trend, showing relatively less pollution in 2020 (darker pixels). Interestingly, yet unsurprisingly, the most densely populated counties, Los Angeles and Orange County, (encircled in red on the map) are predicted to have higher P M2.5 concentrations for all of the years, as shown in the P M2.5 pollution maps. The 2010 population map shows this dense region had a joint population of 12.8 million (top right), and between October 2019 and April 2020, this region showed the greatest shift in predicted P M2.5 concentrations (bottom right). The scatter plot of a sample of predictions from October 2019 versus April 2020 (teal line represents identity mapping) from 2010 (bottom right) illustrates this P M2.5 shift, where points are color-coded by originating county (black points correspond to the ocean). The most significant drop in predicted P M2.5 concentration occurs in Los Angeles (red points) and Orange County (peach).",
