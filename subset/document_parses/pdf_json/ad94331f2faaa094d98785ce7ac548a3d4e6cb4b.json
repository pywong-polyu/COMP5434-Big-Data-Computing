To investigate the potential intermediate host of the SARS-CoV-2, we analyzed spike glycoprotein sequences from different animals, with particular emphasis on bats. We performed phylogenetic analysis and structural reconstruction of the spike glycoproteins with subsequent alignment and comparison. Our phylogenetic results revealed that SARS-CoV-2 was more similar to the bats' betacoronavirus isolates: HKU5-related from Pipistrellus abramus and HKU4-related from Tylonycteris pachypus. We also identified a yak betacoronavirus strain, YAK/ HY24/CH/2017, as the closest match in the comparison of the structural models of spike glycoproteins.

Successful drug and vaccine development require a deep understanding of the virus phylogeny, evolutionary origin, and the source of zoonotic transmission. Also, it should be a top-priority task for researchers to prevent outbreaks of this type in the future. Substantial efforts have been made to identify the animal source of SARS-CoV-2.

The tree was rooted in the outgroup (gammacoronaviruses). As expected, all SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoproteins (with humans as a host) were almost identical and formed separate clusters. Similarly, all the MERS (with humans as a host) were nearly identical and clustered together with camels' MERS (isolates from Kenya), with closely related MERS isolates from the Egyptian camel. Two betacoronavirus isolates from bats, HKU5-and HKU4-related (MN611520.1 Pipistrellus abramus and MN611519.1 Tylonycteris pachypus, respectively), were located between SARS-CoV-2 and MERS clusters. Two other branches formed two well-distinguished clusters for alphacoronaviruses and betacoronaviruses isolates. Alphacoronaviruses have host-dependent subclusters (humans and bats).
