There have been several complications of this disease that have also proven to be debilitating and deadly. While primarily affecting the respiratory system, some cases presented with uncommon complications such as pneumopericardium and spontaneous pneumothorax. We present a case of an elderly female diagnosed with COVID-19 found to have both spontaneous pneumothorax and pneumopericardium. She had a complicated hospital course and ultimately succumbed to her illness. While the pathogenesis of these conditions is not yet fully understood, further studies are needed to help clinicians develop treatment and prevention strategies to improve patient outcomes.",

Her vitals on admission were a heart rate of 91 beats per minute, respiratory rate (RR) of 20 breaths per minute, blood pressure of 119/64 mm Hg, the temperature of 100.3 degrees Fahrenheit, and oxygen saturation (SpO 2 ) of 90% on room air. Physical examination was only remarkable for tachypnea and increased work of breathing for which she was placed on high flow oxygen via nasal cannula with a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO 2 ) of 85% and RR of 35 to maintain an oxygen saturation of 89%-90%. Laboratory findings on admission were unremarkable and she was diagnosed with COVID-19 infection through reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Chest X-ray was also obtained on admission showing bilateral ground-glass opacities consistent with COVID-19 infection ( Figure 1 ). Four days after admission, her oxygen saturation dropped below 88% but her vitals otherwise remained stable. Due to persistent tachypnea despite high flow oxygen, she was switched to bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPap) with an inspiratory positive airway pressure of 12 and expiratory positive airway pressure of 6 and 100% FiO 2 . 1 2 3, 2 1 4, 5",

Spontaneous pneumothorax has an incidence of 7.4 to 18 cases per 100,000 population each year in males and 1.2 to 6 cases per 100,000 population each year in females [7] . Symptoms primarily depend on the size of pneumothorax being asymptomatic when small but progressing to dyspnea and chest pain with decreased or absent breath sounds and hyper-resonance on percussion [7] . Pneumothorax can be due to communication between alveolar spaces and pleura, direct or indirect communication between the atmosphere and the pleural space, or the presence of gas-producing organisms in the pleural space [7] . Petersen et al. reported that peak airway pressure over 50 cm H 2 O is associated with an increased risk of alveolar rupture during mechanical ventilation [8] . There have also been correlations made between high peak airway pressure and the development of pneumothorax [8] . Although high PEEP had been reported to be associated with pneumothorax, several studies have found no such relationship [9] [10] [11] . In our case presentation, the patient was only on a PEEP of 10, which decreased the suspicion of mechanical ventilation as a cause for the pneumothorax.",
