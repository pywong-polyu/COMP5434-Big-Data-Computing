Osimertinib, a third-generation irreversible EGFR tyrosine-kinase inhibitor (TKI) has been used for treatment-resistant NSCLC and was recently approved for patients with advanced NSCLC for first-line use [2] . Drug-induced pneumonitis is a rare, yet life-threatening complication associated with EGFR kinase inhibition therapies including osimertinib [3] . Its use can be associated with a unique and benign radiological finding called \"Transient Asymptomatic Pulmonary Opacities (TAPO)\" that can be confused with an infectious pulmonary process or drug-induced interstitial lung disease (DI-ILD) and may result in overtreatment with antibiotics or premature treatment withdrawal [4] . Here, we present the case of a patient with newly diagnosed metastatic NSCLC started on treatment with osimertinib who developed very early onset severe drug-induced pneumonitis with a unique pattern of pulmonary involvement and was treated with corticosteroids. After resolution of her pulmonary findings, the patient was successfully rechallenged with osimertinib and continued to have an antitumor response.",

Laboratory workup revealed mild leukocytosis (WBC-12,500/\u00b5L) with left shift, lactate of 2.5 mmol/L (normal -<2), C-reactive protein (CRP) -11.7 mg/dL (normal -<0.5), procalcito- nin -0.2 ng/mL (normal -<0.09), new-onset atrial fibrillation on EKG, negative COVID-19 PCR test and normal age-adjusted D-Dimer levels. Chest X-ray demonstrated bibasilar patchy airspace opacities predominantly involving the right lower lobe (Fig. 2) and echocardiogram revealed normal ejection fraction. She was started on empiric broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy with vancomycin and cefepime for suspected pneumonia with sepsis and the osimertinib was withheld temporarily. Over the next few days, her respiratory failure continued to worsen despite the antibiotics. Chest CT scan now demonstrated bilateral dense lower lobe consolidation with air bronchograms and new-onset bilateral pleural effusion but a decrease in the size of dominant lung mass (Fig. 1b) . She was started on high-dose corticosteroids for suspected drug-induced pneumonitis and her symptoms improved significantly within 24 h of starting steroid therapy. Subsequently, all antibiotics were discontinued, and she was discharged home on corticosteroid taper and with osimertinib drug being held.",

We could find only one case in the literature where osimertinib-related pulmonary complications occurred within 1 week of treatment initiation [9] . A unique finding in our patient was the presence of pleural effusion, a finding not commonly reported with EGFR TKI-related ILD. To our knowledge, we could not find any study or individual report referencing pleural effusion as a finding in the ILD spectrum-related with this class of drugs. Whether lung opacities and effusion were initially the TAPO that progressed to ILD is not known. Studies suggest that TAPO could be the preceding finding before the osimertinib-induced ILD in some patients [4, 10] . Lee et al. [10] have classified asymptomatic pulmonary opacities into distinct radiological subtypes based on analysis of CT scans of patients with lung cancer treated with osimertinib. These include cryptogenic organizing pneumonia, simple eosinophilic pneumonia, and the nodular subtype, and others ( Table 2) .",

A \"Stop-and-Go\" technique which comprises drug discontinuation followed by rechallenge has been employed as a reasonable option of managing non-metastatic pulmonary opacities occurring during treatment with osimertinib with a documented antitumor response. Kobayashi et al. [11] suggested stopping treatment upon the development of early pulmonary opacities, such as GGOs as they may denote the late onset of life-threatening ILD. Kobayashi et al. [11] recommend 6 weeks of \"drug holiday\" as it is the median time for resolution of TAPO before osimertinib rechallenge can be considered. While ensuring very close follow-up in the clinic, we successfully rechallenged our patient with osimertinib after the complete resolution of clinical and radiographic lung findings after 6 weeks of corticosteroid therapy. In conclusion, our case highlights the possibility that DI-ILD can rarely occur within days of treatment initiation with osimertinib and safe reintroduction of the drug is possible in select patients following complete resolution of pulmonary radiographic findings and clinical symptoms even with high-grade adverse events.",
