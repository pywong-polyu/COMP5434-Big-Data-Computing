These measures may have a disproportionately large impact on the older age group since personal assistance on (I)ADL has to be minimized and the prohibition of family and other social contacts may worsen feelings of loneliness [2] .",

As a result, older inpatients in acute and long-term care mental health care have been locked-up. Beginning on March 20, contact with their closest family members was prohibited. This latter restriction may cause iatrogenic damage, as social isolation of older adults is associated with a higher risk of the onset of chronic diseases such as cardiovascular, autoimmune, neurocognitive, and affective disorders [6] [7] [8] .",

Since national policies have restricted outpatient care programs, we rapidly transformed individual and group therapy sessions into E-health programs using telephone or video platforms. For older people, this is not always possible, because they lack the knowledge and experience in the use of these new technologies, and sometimes lack the appropriate resources required for this kind of connection to begin with. It is important to avoid ageism, since most of our patients seem to adapt easily to these opportunities. Some patients need additional support to get online, e.g. by setting up online connections with their healthcare providers, and by ensuring that the family will support online access by providing computers or tablets to stay connected. Assisting these older people to digitize will also probably lead to easier access to other health care service providers and help them to stay in touch with friends and relatives. A digital day-treatment program can combine these interventions and could be an alternative for the in-person day-treatment (see case E2). Nonetheless, some psychiatric conditions may prevent the successful application of online therapy (see case E1).",

            "text": "Case C -Mrs. C, 77 years old, an outpatient diagnosed with a bipolar disorder who had been stable on lithium the previous 5 years. Her clinical history mentioned diabetes mellitus and arthrosis. On March 24 th , she visited her GP for severe pain in her ankle; because the patient responded well to tramadol in the past, her GP again prescribed tramadol in a dosage of 50 mg OD. The following night she became anxious and confused. The next day she was seen on the ER where delirium caused by tramadol was diagnosed, or possibly derangement of her diabetes (which was not the case). In the emergency ward, she developed a fever, shortness of breath and a cough. After physical examination, laboratory tests and X-ray she was diagnosed with pneumonia.She tested positive for COVID-19 and was admitted to the COVID unit of the general hospital. Fortunately, Mrs. C had done advance care planning (ACP) in earlier stages with her daughter, GP and one of our old-age psychiatrists. In the ACP, it was decided that she would not be admitted to intensive care if necessary. This was very helpful for the patient, the family and doctors. Luckily, she recovered after one week with supportive care, some additional oxygen and careful evaluation of her lithium. Despite the stress of hospital admission and fear for dying of COVID-19, her mood remained remarkably stable and she was discharged from the hospital in good condition.Case D -Mrs. D, a 67-year old female with no psychiatric or somatic history was seen on urgent referral by her GP to our Old-age department, because of extreme anxiety, depressive mood and nihilistic thoughts. She worried obsessively about her 35-yearold daughter, who was living in the southern Netherlands, the epicenter of the COVID-19 outbreak. Mrs. D manifested so-called 'COVID delusions': she thought she was the cause of the COVID-19 pandemic in the Netherlands. She had developed suicidal thoughts and persisted in the idea that the world would be saved if she died. As this was the first episode of psychiatric deterioration, an extensive physical examination was done, including laboratory tests, X-ray and brain CT; no abnormalities were found.Despite the fact that her daughter was not infected by COVID-19, Mrs. D remained depressed and treatment was started with a TCA.Case E -Mrs. E1 and E2 both participated in our day-treatment clinic for older patients two days a week. They followed a CBT-based program including group sessions for cognitive therapy, behavioral activation, psychomotor therapy, creative therapy as well as nurse-directed life-review and goal-oriented sessions. This program is generally delivered in groups of no more than 8 patients. Since outpatient group sessions were no longer permitted, we converted our program into online group therapy using Webex. All patients were instructed individually on how to use the online system, and 5 out of 8 patients agreed to continue their therapy using online group sessions. Two patients consented to the use of their information for this case series, i.e. one patient who refused online group therapy and one who is currently participating. Mrs. E1, a 65year-old woman diagnosed with a bipolar disorder, refused to participate. She had recently recovered from a manic-psychotic episode and had just started day-treatment as follow-up for her inpatient treatment. She refused online group sessions, which she felt infringed in her privacy and feared would result in online persecution. She did however agree to individual online sessions twice a week. Mrs. E2, 77 years old, was able and willing to join the online group day treatment. She had a history of a highlevel borderline personality disorder and generalized anxiety disorder. She experienced a relapse after neurosurgery for frontal meningioma complicated by epileptic seizures.",

            "text": "our existing case-load could be an initial manifestation of COVID-19 infection (see case A and C). In case C, possible factors such as delirium from deranged blood-sugar levels, or the use of painkillers, may have precluded and delayed proper COVID-19 diagnoses (see case C).3. Expanding on this second point, triage of suspected COVID-19 infections is complex in geriatric psychiatric patients, as is illustrated by case B. Case B does not take place in a vacuum, since every week, a number older patients in the long-stay unit normally contract infectious diseases of all kinds. Since a small-scale epidemic in a specialized old-age center is a horrifying scenario, we isolate patients as quickly as possible upon suspicion of COVID-19, which may include fever, shortness of breath, and cough, but sometimes even atypical presentation of gastrointestinal symptoms, fatigue, headache or muscle pain alone[9]. Since fever or coughing alone is highly prevalent, most tests results are negative. In addition, the costs ofisolation are high, as shown by the consequent effects of case A (Mr. A2). Moreover, placement of non-COVID-19 subjects on a quarantine ward poses an ethical challenge, because in worst case scenarios, patients are infected with the COVID-19 virus instead of being protected from it. 4. In emergency situations such as a quickly developing viral infection like COVID-19, advance care planning is very useful in supporting clinical decision-making (as was the case in case C). We have distributed clear information for patients in all of our geriatric wards and opened this discussion previously as much as possible. Theinformation indicates that ICU support in COVID-19 will be required for a long time(3-4 weeks)  and that frail (older) people have low survival rates and generally end up with major loss of functioning. Another disadvantage of being in an ICU is that no family is allowed during this pandemic and if the COVID-19 is ultimately fatal, the patient dies alone (see case A). Visitors are not allowed in normal COVID units either, but in the case of those who are dying, it is possible to arrange for family to visit the patient to allow a proper farewell period and to prevent pathological grief.",
