Rigorous tools to guide background correction, the quantification of within-sample variation, normalisation, and batch correction specifically for protein microarrays are limited, require extensive investigation and are not centrally accessible.",

Our graphical and tabular interfaces facilitate a detailed inspection of data and are coupled with supporting guidelines that enable users to select the most appropriate algorithms to systematically address bias arising in customized experiments. The localization and distribution of background signal intensities determine the optimal correction strategy. A novel function overcomes the limitations in the interpretation of the coefficient of variation when signal intensities are at the lower end of the detection threshold. We demonstrate essential considerations in the experimental design and their impact on a range of algorithms for normalization and minimization of batch effects.",

In the former, gene expression levels are typically compared by mixing test and control samples that are labelled with a pair of distinct fluorescent dyes. The emission signal at a defined locus in a test sample is expressed as a ratio, relative to its counterpart in the control. Normalization in this context factors in intrinsic differences between dyes and the relative efficiency of their incorporation into the samples under investigation. In contrast, standard protein microarrays ( microarrays) quantify the absolute fluorescent emission detected following antibody binding to a single protein, therefore other considerations for normalization become more important.",

An expectation of minimal variation in the majority of genes with the exception of the one(s) under investigation is the norm in standard DNA microarray experiments [10] . The exact opposite is true for experimental designs where important differences in antibody binding between individuals and proteins underpin the hypothesis [3] .

The local background is the signal detected in the immediate vicinity of a spot. Subtracting the median local background pixel intensities from the foreground is thought to give an unbiased estimator of the true signal intensity for that specific spot [16] . However, uneven variation in the local background across an entire slide may skew the data [23] and can be minimized by implementing a global background subtraction. This subtracts the median of all the local background intensities for a given slide from each spot on that slide. When artefacts are localized to a specific region of a slide often referred to as a block or mini-array, the moving minimum background or half moving minimum background correction options can be adopted [8] . The former restricts the subtraction of local backgrounds to the block within the slide. Since many spots may be affected within a block, it utilizes the minimum rather than the median local background. Zero or negative values are subsequently set to half the minimum of the positive corrected background intensities different from limma implementation that sets any intensity which is <0.5 after background subtraction to be equal to 0.5.",

We formally assessed this using the mean versus standard deviation plots (meanSdPlots) and coupled this to automatically derived Spearman correlation estimates (Rho) and Cox-Stuart or the Mann-Kendall trend tests. The latter quantifies the performance of the normalization. In the example below, we illustrate the versatility of the tool across four Methods for normalization. Using these approaches, the MVD reduction led to a drop in the Rho estimate from 0.93 to between 0.2 and 0.3 in this dataset as shown in Fig. 5 below. Implementation of the log 2 approach led to an inflation of variance for the low MFI (Mean Fluorescent Intensity) values. The cyclic loess and RLM were not optimal for the experimental design (discussed in the methods). Consequently, the VSN normalization approach was adopted (Fig. 5) . We then proceeded to investigate batch effects using ComBat from the SVA package. The day-to-day dependence was noticeably reduced by ComBat batch correction [Supplementary B Fig. 1 ] for day m1 and m2.",

For example, in the context of malaria seroepidemiology, age and geographical location are critical determinants of antibody levels [35] . The processing of samples of young children at one time-point, and those of older children at another, could inadvertently lead to enhanced differences in either group that were unrelated to the true underlying biological variation.
