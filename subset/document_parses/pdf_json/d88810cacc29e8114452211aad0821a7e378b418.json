Thanks to these non-pharmaceutical measures, the number of new confirmed cases reported in the past week was below 30.

Behavior changes in this model account for all social distancing interventions such as avoiding mass gathering, and maintaining personal distance and hygiene habits. School closures and remote working were also accounted for among the behavioral changes considered. Exposed individuals move to the infectious group after the incubation period; infectious individuals are isolated after laboratory confirmation. In this study, infectious individuals were assumed to be isolated immediately after confirmation. The isolated individuals are removed through either COVID-19 induced death or recovery.

If public behavioral changes are maintained, the second wave might be prevented. However, once these measures are reduced, the rate of local transmission will again increase, resulting in the second wave epidemic peak in October 2020 (Fig 4) . The second peak and number of cases in the second wave might be lower compared to the first wave. These estimates are based on the assumption that susceptible individuals return to their behavior change as new confirmed cases are reported.",

These measures included screening and quarantining of confirmed cases and close contacts, school closures, recommendations on strict personal hygiene and refraining from non-essential gatherings, and frequent disinfecting and ventilating of shared spaces. The combination of these policies and public cooperation resulted in a decreased number of cases. These social distancing efforts are reflected in the model in the behavior-changed susceptible category. The disease transmission rate and behavior change rate was estimated as 4.6180 and 2.6044, respectively. The mean effective reproduction number from February 16 to May 6 was estimated as 2.2370. This modeling study has shown that the ROK government and citizens have successfully responded to the spread of COVID-19 using only non-pharmaceutical interventions such as social distancing and public behavior change.",

However, these measures cannot eliminate the disease. Recently, the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has warned of the risk of a second wave of COVID-19 in the late fall/early winter 2020. The CDC director announced that social distancing will be implemented to mitigate the disease spread [11] . The spokesperson for the White House Coronavirus Task Force has also indicated that COVID-19 may return with a second wave during October-November period [12] . Mathematical modeling might help assess the risk of a second wave. Once new confirmed cases become sporadic and social distancing is reduced, outbreak reoccurrence is possible even without an imported case; concurrently, an imported case of COVID-19 might exacerbate the second wave.",

The model included parameters based on data from the early phase of the epidemic; while some parameters which have not studied so far such as transmission reduction factor of behavior-changed individuals are assumed. As no reliable data are available on the number of asymptomatic cases or the associated transmissibility, unreported asymptomatic cases were not considered in this model, while reported asymptomatic cases were assumed to have the same transmissibility as the symptomatic cases. In Korea, we considered that the transmission possibility from exposed or asymptomatic infectious is not relatively high because of the intensive contact tracing system. All close contacts with confirmed cases need to be tested regardless of the symptoms. Even if the confirmation test of close contact were negative, they need to follow 14 days self-quarantine policy and they are released from the quarantine after additional test at the end of the quarantine. Moreover, the government emphasized to wear a facial mask in public space and keep their personal hygiene. Among the confirmed cases, over 90% of cases were identifiable the epidemic link of transmission. It also supports that transmitted cases from exposed or asymptomatic cases beyond the government monitoring were not relatively high. The cases confirmed at the airport were excluded from model of local transmission dynamics. Once the exposed individuals entered the country and became infected, they were regarded as locally transmitted cases, based on the KCDC data classification system. These considerations might have resulted in overestimation of the parameters.",

Proactive participation of the general public and suitable government policies are essential. Susceptible individuals need to be conscious of the disease risk and adhere to the relevant prevention guidelines. However, COVID-19 cannot be eliminated with non-pharmaceutical measures alone. Long-term social distancing is associated with high socio-economic cost. Availability of vaccine and antiviral drugs is paramount to achieving the end of COVID-19 pandemic. Further research should determine how to balance non-pharmaceutical and pharmaceutical interventions. ",
