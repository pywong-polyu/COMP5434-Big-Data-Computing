In December 2019, a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) was reported from a cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China [1] . As defined by World Health Organization (WHO), a confirmed case is detected from nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT) for SARS-CoV-2, such as real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), that is worldwide preferred [2] . Nowadays, immunometric assays (IMAs) are performed for detecting the immune response to COVID-19, while several test manufacturers have launched various rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs), to facilitate SARS-CoV-2 detection at point-ofcare.",

Most RDTs are designed on the basis of lateral-flow immunoassay (LFIA), and they are currently used for a qualitative and to some extent quantitative COVID-19 monitoring in public or private non-laboratory environments. Sajid et al. [7] present Ag-RDTs (antigen-RDTs) as devices consisting of prefabricated strips of a carrier material with dry reagents, activated when applying the recommended specimen. Similar assays, but which rapidly detect antibodies targeting SARS-CoV-2, include Ig-RDTs (immunoglobulin-RDTs).",

Common causes of falsenegative Ag-RDT tests include: 1) faulty technique in operating the assay, 2) insufficient clinical specimens, 3) inhibitors, and 4) antigen degradation. LFIA's performance depends on numerous factors, while luminescent and fluorescent LFIAs have higher sensitivity [42] . Inexperienced operators who may be deployed to run large volumes of Ag-RDTs for COVID-19 monitoring, may handle assay materials poorly or interpret tests incorrectly, compounding the rates of false-negative tests. Each tests' result is affected by the dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 viral load in early pre-symptomatic and later stages of viral shedding [43] . An insufficient sample or viral mutation can cause a false result, and an individual may have the virus, but the swab might have not collected it from nose or throat. Apart from possible exogenous substances, endogenous molecules could clog the membrane at the cassettes' conjugate pad in high concentrations. Certain 'sandwich' LFIAs may give rise to falsenegative results when samples are saturated with antigen: the socalled Hook effect [44] .",

Moreover, handling and sampling that lead to antibody degradation can give rise to false-negative results. Autoimmune conditions and treatment thereof may also give rise to false-negative tests for SARS-CoV -2 antibody [48, 49] . Deeks et al. [3] report that most cases of symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection will test positive for antibodies directed against the virus. When a patient is early ill, IgM/IgA antibodies may not be peripherally detectable, and IgA, IgM and IgG antibodies present a sensitivity heterogeneity [3] . Also, endogenous and exogenous factors can affect the final result. Hematocrit, triglycerides, cholesterol (as the cellulose-based material into the cassette LFIA is hydrophilic and affected by viscosity), hemoglobin, and sample temperature, could affect the final result in some cases [18, 19] . In traditional lateral flow serodiagnostic formats, the degree of detectable binding is reduced in the presence of high concentrations of nonspecific immunoglobulin. Laboratory IMAs' negativity is being affected by antibody interference at the same way as the positivity, but in the first case, the extra antibodies interfere by separating and binding to the control and the targeting antibodies, thus blocking the reaction.",

Faulty sample collection, processing, transportation, or degradation of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA during shipping/storage, can lead to suboptimal rRT-PCR test performance and false-negative SARS-CoV-2 results. Viral load and Ct affect result accuracy, while applying a cutoff could reduce false-positive and increase falsenegative test results [30] . However, in some tests, falsenegative results occurring through lack of cell material in the sample are controlled for by simultaneous detection of a universally expressed human gene. Most tests present a LoD for the number of viral copies that can be detected, and false-negative tests may arise if the viral load is lower than that detection limit [2] . Poor sample quality or collection in very early or late infection could give rise to a false-negative test, depending on the assay's sensitivity [2] . Also, sample degradation is a possible etiology for a false-negative PCR test result. Furthermore, SARS-CoV-2 may not be detected, or may give rise to ambiguous test results, if the genome expressing target genes is mutated [2] . The fluorescent system, which plays a crucial role in the final result, may be affected by PCR inhibitors in the sample. Also, pooling strategies, as laboratory methods in PCR assays can be risky for giving rise to false-negative test results. A brief synopsis of the etiologies for false test results is illustrated in Table 1 .",

Because of suboptimal test sensitivity and specificity, false-negative and false-positive results may occur. False-negative results, which lead to a failure of detecting persons who are infected with SARS-CoV-2, are potentially more damaging than false-positive tests. It is essential that such falsenegative test results be minimized, so that respiratory physicians and other clinical staff caring for such patients are alerted to the correct diagnosis as soon as possible, especially when hospitalization and further treatment strategies are necessary. The PCR assay on respiratory specimens may be inhibited in several ways, apart from a SARS-CoV-2 mutant that cannot be detected by the assay, and respiratory physicians should be trained to preempt falsenegative test results, in COVID-19 or other pathogens requiring a PCR assay identification.",

Combs et al. [54] and Kuffel et al. [55] report metal ions that affect PCR performance, and Marino-Merlo et al. [56] show that reverse transcriptase can be inhibited from antiretroviral drugs. The capacity of each PCR test kit to perform in the presence of different inhibitors have been presented in interim guidance documents.

Important exogenous factors that affect PCR assays are specific drugs that may exist in respiratory tract specimens, such as nasal sprays including humic and fulvic acids' derivatives, phenolic ions, polysaccharides, polyamines, etc., that mainly inhibit DNA polymerization. For instance, inhaled drugs with specific chemical substances, such as inhaled heparin for pulmonary function, or inhaled D-cycloserine, may affect the final result, while a high concentration of intranasal cellulose powder may lead to nucleic acid or polymerization inhibition. Furthermore, chemotherapy drugs, such as bleomycin, may affect PCR, as the inhibition mechanism is almost the same, and especially bleomycin can give rise to bleomycin-induced pneumonitis (BIP) which provides a saturated bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) specimen for a low sensitive PCR assay.

In general, false-positive COVID-19 cases are more likely to exist in a low COVID-19 prevalence in the community where other viruses abound, and false-negative COVID-19 are more likely to exist in a community rating other comorbidities. Since COVID-19 Ag-RDTs were initially based on SARS-CoV highly conserved genetic loci, it is certain that they can present a false-positive result for SARS-CoV-2 [8], and less accurate Ag-RDTs show a positivity to influenzas, other viruses, or bacteria. If sample contains blood, there is a possibility for blood-derived substances and antibodies to interfere in the assay, as occurring in the IMAs. Rapid (Ig-RDTs) and laboratory IMAs (such as ELISA) are more likely to be affected by the preexisted individual's immunity, such as several autoimmune diseases [13, 22] . Also, Ig-RDTs have indicated a false-positivity even in pregnant women [58] . IMAs' interference has been reported in specific diseases producing heterophile antibodies, such as infectious mononucleosis (IM) [59] . More than a half of the patients' samples contain HAAAs [25, 60] that interfere in IMAs by presenting both positivity and negativity, while existing mainly in serum of animal workers, people living with indoor pets or patients being administered genetically engineered mouse monoclonal antibodies (Ig-drugs) for therapy or imaging. In reality, all human beings present autoantibodies interfering in IMAs and, thus, every serological test should be interpreted according to an individual's total health condition [61, 62] . Rheumatoid factor (RF) and antinuclear antibodies have long been reported for serological interferences [63] [64] [65] . HIV, hepatitis, syphilis, malaria, lupus, vasculitis, hyper-gamma-globulinaemia and presence of HLA-DR antibodies have long been correlated with false IMAs test results and antibody interference [66] [67] [68] [69] .",
