Disease severity is also an important parameter that is being continually evaluated, with a current focus on patients experiencing serious pulmonary disease and other life-threatening conditions. Although patient care is the first priority, in the public health emergency situation brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic, it is also of the utmost importance to collect, process, and share with rapidity and confidence human biological materials, clinical data,, and study outcomes.

The paper addresses the methods for sample and data collection and the systematization of the samples and data for research purposes. As COVID-19 increasingly reveals itself as a multi-systemic disease, the purpose of this data collection is to include the most relevant clinical variables that identify multi-organ involvement as well as identifying the genetic determinants of virus-host interaction, so as to holistically disclose the effect of COVID-19 over several physiological subsystems.

The healthcare infrastructures and the working conditions are tremendously challenged in many hospitals and direct patient care has rightly been given the highest priority. The main public health focus is on monitoring infection evolution in terms of the number of new cases and the number of deaths as well as patients experiencing serious pulmonary or systemic disease. To better characterize the current outbreak and facilitate prospective research to address the current and possible future epidemics/pandemics, we set up a COVID-19 Biobank and Patient Registry where biological samples and associated clinical data from patients are collected in a standardized manner.", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF7": {"text": "dyspnea), COVID-19 severely ill patients can often have symptoms of a multisystemic disorder [21]. Multiple organ failure due to diffuse microvascular damage is an important cause of death in COVID-19 severely affected patients [22]. In line with our definition of an A1 subgroup, a retrospective study on 21 deaths after SARS-Co-V2 infection recently reported that 71% of patients who died had disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), while the incidence of DIC in surviving patients was 0.6% [23]. These data suggest that DIC is an important risk factor for increased in hospital mortality and special attention should be paid to its early diagnosis and treatment. While a debate still exists about the significance of pancreatic enzyme elevations during COVID-19 infection and the capability of SARS-CoV-2 virus to induce pancreatic injury due to cytotoxic effects [24, 25], it is worth noting that among patients with a multisystemic involvement we observe a subclass of individuals (group A2) with pancreatic damage, likely suggesting a secondary effect of SARS-CoV-2 infection on a subgroup of genetically predisposed individuals. Inflammatory cytokine \"storm,\" has been reported as playing a key role in the severe immune injury to the lungs caused by T cell over-activation (group B) [26]. While some investigators have suggested a potential mechanism of myocardial injury due to COVID 19 induced cytokine storm that is mediated by a mixed T helper cell response in combination to hypoxia [27], our findings indicate rather a distinct class of patients, group E, presenting with heart involvement in the", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF8": {"text": "Frequently the phenotype of common (complex) disorders is oversimplified, thus attenuating reliable correlation with genetic data. Limiting the representation to differences of single parameters, such as respiratory assistance (intubation, CPAP-BiPAP, oxygensupplementation, etc.), is a possible trap for studies on complex disorders, such as COVID-19. Similarly, genetic data are often too large to be mined and fragmented in different not communicating methods, betting on either the power of common polymorphisms (GWAS) or the power of variant accumulation (burden gene test for WES). The binary representation we are proposing here, together with network propagation for feature reduction,, and followed by machine learning approaches,, may help in this task. A rare disorder called TAR (OMIM # 274000) is teaching us that combinatorial rules of rare variant(s) with more common polymorphism(s) is what we are looking for [37]. The GEN-COVID Multicenter Study with its Registry (GCPR), Biobank (GCB), and Genetic Data Repository (GCGDR) is structured to continually link with leading European and international research organizations, public and private, as well as with regulatory and public health authorities for developing COVID-19 and SARS-related medicines research and treatment protocols.
