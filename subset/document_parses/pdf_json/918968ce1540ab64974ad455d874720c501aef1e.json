Materials and Methods: This cross-sectional study involved 1277 participants who answered a web-based open survey with questions about the use of facemasks during the COVID-19 pandemic. Descriptive statistics with percentages was performed, and the responses were analyzed with chi-square and independent t-tests. Results: A total of 1277 answered the questionnaire, and most participants were female (81.8%). Almost all the participants (99.1%) reported wearing facemasks, and 34.2% are wearing just because it is mandatory; 65.8% would continue to wear masks even if it was not mandatory. Most subjects (50.4%) believe that masks' use effectively prevents infection by the novel coronavirus. Reusable fabric facemasks are the most used by the participants (49.5%). Almost all subjects were wearing masks to go to crowded and public places. Most respondents (67.3%) are bothered with the use of facemasks, and the most cited reason for the discomfort was feeling trapped or suffocated (58.9%). Discussion: The use of facemasks can help prevent the COVID-19, but it is most effective at reducing the spread of the virus when the general population's compliance is high. Some factors that limit the population's compliance with the use of masks are discomfort and a sense of embarrassment. Media campaigns and public health promotion activities supported by governmental agencies can increase the use of facemasks by the population. Conclusion: The mean level of anxiety with the COVID-19 pandemic was 6.18. Almost all the participants were wearing facemasks, and they believe that its use effectively prevents infection by the novel coronavirus. Reusable fabric facemasks are the most used by the participants. Almost all subjects were wearing masks to go to crowded and public places. The great majority of the participants feel more protected with the use of facemasks.",

In Brazil, the COVID-19 outbreak is still not under control, and the number of cases is still rising or maintained, depending on the Brazilian region.

For the COVID-19 specifically, the evidence of prevention of contamination is low because it was based on observational studies with a high risk of bias. 13 However, facemasks are physical barriers, cheap, and efficient in reducing short distance transmission through direct or indirect contact and droplet emission. 11, 12, [14] [15] [16] Despite the uncertainty of infection control with the use of masks, the possible risk reduction must be considered in the context of the local epidemiology. 13 This way, in Brazil, the public health measures to implement of facemask is more crucial due to the higher baseline risk for transmission. 17 Mandatory use of facemask in public places during the COVID-19 pandemic caused the worsening in the global shortage of commercial supplies and led to the widespread use of homemade masks and mask alternatives, 7 and this have changed the Brazilians population' habits. From a public policy perspective, there are concerns about the efficacy and the discomfort of prolonged use facemasks, which have led the population to a wide variation adherence to the government's recommendations; some people are not using facemasks, and others are using as recommended.",

This health-related group presented more males, a higher education level, a greater family income, and was less anxious with the pandemic than the laypeople group (Table 1) . It was expected since it is known that higher income is beneficial for psychological well-being. 31, 32 People with higher income are happier, more satisfied with their lives, material status, health, achievement, economic situation, and social conditions. 33 When the questionnaire was sent to the subjects, the use of facemask had been advised or compulsory in Brazil for more than three months, and the coronavirus pandemic was at the outbreak's rising curve. A recent survey showed that N95 masks, medical masks, and homemade masks made of 4-layer kitchen paper and 1-layer fabric could block 99.98%, 97.14%, and 95.15% of the virus in aerosols, respectively. 20 Moreover, the use of masks can enhance vigilance, prevent direct hand-mouth or handnose contact, and reduce air contamination of pathogens from infected people. 20 Recent studies demonstrated a decrease in psychopathological symptoms after the compulsory use of masks in public spaces 34 and workplaces. 35 Facemasks increased the level of perceived self-protection as well as improved well-being and mental health. 34 Almost all the participants (99.1%) reported wearing facemasks during the COVID-19 pandemic. This result is in agreement with the results of Leung et al 3 conducted in Hong Kong in the early stage of the pandemic. However, 34.2% are wearing masks only because it is mandatory. It is known that compliance with the use of facemasks is affected by the perception of risk. 36 During a pandemic, it would be expected that compliance improves. Models suggest that public mask wearing is most effective at stopping the spread of the virus when compliance is high. 37 The balance between risk perception and discomfort affects individual decisions to use facemasks. 5 When the risk of infection is thought to be high, acceptance and compliance with interventions to prevent infection are generally higher. 38 A common policy response to this is to ensure compliance by using laws and regulations, which is still not completely defined in Brazil.",

Another finding was that the health-related group feels more protected than the laypeople (Table 1 ). The available evidence suggests that near-universal adoption of nonmedical masks in public places, combined with complementary health measures, could successfully reduce the community spread. 37 One can think that wearing masks can give the false feeling that the public is completely DovePress protected from the virus, and within this context, it could be speculated that the health-related group was feeling more protected due to their greater knowledge related to infectious diseases and also the usual routine of wearing masks. Nevertheless, Chu et al 12 did not detect any striking differences in the effectiveness of facemask use between community settings and health care settings. However, the existing evidence regarding the efficacy of using facemasks is sparse, and findings are inconsistent. While some studies support the use of respiratory protection, 12, 20, 37, 39 they also evidence that this intervention did not afford complete protection from infection. 12 Therefore, the objective of this study was not to evaluate the effectiveness of the facemask use but to evaluate if and how the population is using it.",
