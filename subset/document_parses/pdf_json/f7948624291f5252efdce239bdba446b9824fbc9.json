This virus infects most of the ciliated cells in the alveoli, and these cells stop carrying out their normal activity, which consists of clearing the airways. Consequently, there is progressive accumulation of debris and fluid in the lungs, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) develops [7] . This complication has been observed in COVID-19 inpatients, and mechanical ventilation (MV) is a common supportive treatment in these cases [3] . Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP) has already been reported as a complication in COVID-19-hospitalized patients [4, 8] .",

In the first 4 days of hospitalization, VAP usually involves oropharyngeal microbiota, while after at least 5 days of hospitalization it involves Multidrug-Resistant (MDR) pathogens [10] , which are more related to ICU mortality than non-MDR. The mortality rate can be up to 60% when VAP is caused by MDR pathogens [11] . Reports describing pathogens of VAP developing after MV for COVID-19 are scarce until now.
