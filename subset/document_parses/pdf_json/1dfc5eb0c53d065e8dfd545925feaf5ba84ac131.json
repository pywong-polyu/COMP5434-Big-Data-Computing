Additionally, WB is also used as a supplement to the treatment of osteoarthritis (OA) in clinical practice. Our research aimed to reveal the therapeutic effects and underling mechanism of WB on RA and OA through computational system pharmacology analysis and experimental study. Based on network pharmacology analysis, a total of 173 bioactive compounds interacted with 417 common gene targets related to WB, RA, and OA, which mainly involved the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway. In addition, the serine\u2212threonine protein kinase 1 (AKT1) might be a core gene protein for the action of WB, which was further emphasized by molecular docking. Moreover, the anti-inflammatory activity of WB in vitro was confirmed by reducing NO production in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced RAW264.7 cells. The anti-RA and OA effects of WB in vivo were confirmed by ameliorating the disease symptoms of collagen II-induced RA (CIA) and monosodium iodoacetate-induced OA (MIA) in rats, respectively. Furthermore, the role of the PI3K-Akt pathway in the action of WB was preliminarily verified by western blot analysis. In conclusion, our study elucidated that WB is a potentially effective strategy for the treatment of RA and OA, which might be achieved by regulating the PI3K-Akt pathway. It provides us with systematic insights into the effects and mechanism of WB on RA and OA.",

The etiology of RA and OA is complex and still unclear, while generally believed to be related to genetic predisposition and environmental factors. So far, there is no cure for RA and OA. Anti-inflammatory drugs, such as nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs and corticosteroids, are commonly used to treat arthritis, but these drugs are associated with severe side effects and lack robust efficacy. 8, 9 TCMs have been shown to be effective and safe in clinical applications for thousands of years. 10 Moreover, increasing pieces of evidence have demonstrated that TCMs, which include TCM formulas, herbal medicines, and other natural products, are precious resources for curing chronic and complex diseases. 11 Wang-Bi capsule (WB), as a TCM-based herbal formula, has been used in the treatment of RA in China for many years and has shown positive therapeutic effects. 12, 13 In addition, WB is also used as a supplement to the treatment of OA. WB is composed of several medicinal materials, with the characteristics of multicomponents and multitargets. However, WB still lacks sufficient experimental research, and its mechanism of action remains unclear.",

In vitro experiments, cell viability was first examined with the CCK8 kit to evaluate the cytotoxicity of WB, LPS, and BBR. The results showed that WB (50\u2212800 \u03bcg/mL), LPS (1 \u03bcg/mL), and BBR (8 \u03bcmol/L) had no significant inhibition effect on cell viability, indicating the dose of which had no significant cytotoxicity ( Figure 2B ). Free radical, such as NO, which played vital role in various inflammatory disorders. 17 The anti-inflammatory effect of WB was evaluated on LPS (1 \u03bcg/mL)-induced RAW264.7 cells by using the Griess reagent to detect the level of NO in the supernatant. As shown in Figure  2C , the NO production in the model group (LPS, 1 \u03bcg/mL) was significantly increased compared with the control group (P < 0.001), indicating the successful establishment of the cellular inflammation model. Compared with the model group, the different concentrations of the WB group and positive control BBR group significantly inhibited the NO production (P < 0.001), demonstrating the anti-inflammatory effect of WB in vitro. In addition, there was significant difference of WB at the concentrations of 50 and 800 \u03bcg/mL (P < 0.05). On day 21 after model establishment (d21), the symptoms of rats, including obvious weight loss (P < 0.001), paw volume severe increase (P < 0.001), and high arthritis index score (greater than 4), indicated the successful establishment of the CIA model ( Figure 3A \u2212C). Next, rats in each group received different treatments for 3 weeks. During the treatment, the above-mentioned symptoms of rats in the DF group and WB various dose groups gradually alleviated to a varying degree. After administration (d42), the weight of rats in the DF group increased significantly compared with the Mod group (P < 0.001), while there was no significant difference in WB groups, as presented in Figure 3A . In addition, the paw volume of rats in the DF group (P < 0.001), combined with WB-M and WB-H groups (P < 0.01) significantly decreased ( Figure 3B ).

Interestingly, admin-istration of DF, WB-H, and WB-M could effectively alleviate inflammatory cell infiltration, synovial proliferation, and cartilage destruction to a certain extent. What is more, to detect the imaging changes of ankle joints in rats, the micro-CT analysis was performed, and the results are shown in Figure 3F .

The specific pathogenesis of RA and OA is still unclear, and there is no cure for RA and OA at present. Some existing medications, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, can be used for the treatment of RA and OA; however, they are often accompanied by side effects and poor long-term therapeutic effects. In contrast, TCM has the characteristics of low side effects, strong overall effect, addressing both symptoms and root causes, and good long-term effects. Correspondingly, TCM has unique advantages in the treatment of chronic and complex diseases. WB is a TCM-based herbal formula and has been used in clinical practice for many years. In the present study, network pharmacology analysis combined with molecular docking and experimental verification was performed to investigate the therapeutic effects and decipher the mechanism of WB on RA and OA. Based on the network pharmacology analysis, a total of 173 bioactive compounds were screened from WB, and 417 common gene targets related to WB, RA, as well as OA were identified. After that, the M\u2212C\u2212T network was established. Among the 173 compounds, 16 shared compounds were considered to play a vital role in WB. Moreover, the top five in the M\u2212C\u2212T network according to the degree value were anhydroicaritin, oleanolic acid, kaempferol, luteolin, and quercetin, respectively. The higher the degree value, the more important it was in the network. In addition, the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway and the AKT1 protein were regarded as the potential mechanism and core gene target of WB against RA and OA. Based on molecular docking, 16 shared compounds all showed good affinity with the AKT1 protein, and the lower the value, the better the affinity. The top five in affinity were anhydroicaritin, oleanolic acid, kaempferol, luteolin, and quercetin, respectively. Therefore, three compounds (oleanolic acid, luteolin, and anhydroicaritin) and AKT1 protein attracted our attention, which were considered to play a vital role of WB in the treatment of RA and OA.",

It provides not only scientific evidence for the clinical application of WB but also insights into our understanding of the action mechanism for WB on RA and OA. In particular, it is of great significance for understanding the pharmacological mechanism of TCMs in the treatment of complex diseases. ",

Establishment of Collagen-Induced RA and Evaluation of the Anti-RA Effect In Vivo. The CIA model was established based on previously reported methods with modification. 17,37 In brief, bovine collagen II was dissolved in 0.05 mol L \u22121 acetic acid overnight at 4\u00b0C to obtain the collagen solution (2 mg mL \u22121 ). Then, on day 0, rats were given a primary immunization, respectively, with an intradermal tail vein injection of emulsion (200 \u03bcL), obtained by emulsifying collagen solution and CFA at a ratio of 1:1 in an ice bath. On day 7, rats were intradermally rechallenged with collagen II emulsified in IFA. Wistar female rats were randomly divided into six groups: control group (Con), model group (Mod), positive control diclofenac sodium group (DF), WB low-dose group (WB-L), WB medium-dose group (WB-M), and WB high-dose group (WB-H), and each group consisted of eight rats. Except for the control group, other groups replicated the CIA model according to the above methods. On day 21, the successful establishment of the CIA model in rats was determined by the arthritis index (AI) scores greater than or equal to 4. The criteria of AI scores were as follows: (0) normal; (1) erythema and slight swelling of the ankle joint; (2) erythema and slight swelling of the ankle joint to the plantar joint or palmar joint; (3) erythema and moderate swelling of the ankle joint to the plantar joint or palmar joint; and (4) erythema and severe swelling. The total score of each paw for an individual rat was as an AI, with a maximum total score of 16.

After that, Con group rats were injected with saline (50 \u03bcL) into the articular cavity of unilateral knee joints, while the other group rats were injected with MIA solution (3 mg/50 \u03bcL).
