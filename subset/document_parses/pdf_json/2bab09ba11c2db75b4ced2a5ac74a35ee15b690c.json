Based on a thematic analysis of ten individual interview transcripts collected from five career practitioners and five ex-users, the study discussed four interlocking domains of experiences and experience-driven career interventions for enhancing youth's capabilities to aspire and realize aspirations with a transition from the zone of proximal development to the zone of aspired development, namely, recognition, exposures, self-growth and transferability. We recommended further research studies on evaluating the effectiveness of using the ED framework for applying the capability approach to strengthening the career capabilities of service users characterized by diversity and vulnerability in different service settings.",

In Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries, 11.9% of youth population aged 15-24 were NEET in 2018 (World Bank, 2019) . The corresponding figure in Hong Kong was 65,068 accounting for 8.9% of those aged 15-24 (Office of Government Economist Financial Secretary's Office, 2018). Yet, against the backdrop of social unrest erupting in 2019 and the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic since early 2020, Hong Kong is now confronting challenges in containing an increasing number of NEET youth and addressing the consequent socioeconomic problems caused by the loss of earnings and increased public finance.",

Such a framework aimed to promote people's freedom to achieve the functioning and aspirations they value, exercise individual agency, explore resources and opportunities in various learning and work domains, and enhance their adaptability and capabilities in confronting challenges that individuals, especially those with vulnerability, have to face every day (Robertson, 2015; Savickas, 1997; Sgaramella & Ferrari, 2019) .",

Each service team employed around eight social workers as career practitioners to deliver career guidance, counselling and interventions for youth clients on a one-on-one and group basis as appropriate. The project also established a research team housed in a university where the authors are/were affiliated to, which took up the responsibility to evaluate programme effectiveness and consolidate the service design and delivery experience for promoting knowledge transfer.

The concept of capabilities refers to what people will be able to do given that opportunities are available, which is distinguished from the concept of functionings understood as achieved abilities (Krishnakumar, 2007) . Programmes informed by the capability approach call for attention to what young people really want for their own lives, what their interests dwell in and how they tend to define themselves with their evolving experiences (Edgell & McQuaid, 2016; Hollywood et al., 2012) . The capability approach challenges the existing normative framework overemphasizing the importance of educational and career credentials and offers space for discussing how policy making, service delivery and professional practice can expand both symbolic and tangible resources to recognize and realize the talents and aspirations of youth (Avis, 2014; Orton, 2011) . Moreover, transition to paid work within a short period is not necessarily a positive antecedent leading to quality employment or life (Vero et al., 2012) . The capability approach instead takes expanded and meaningful options defined by the beholders (Deneulin, 2011) and a critical examination of the diverse impact of career interventions (Fuertes et al., 2021; Joncas & Pilote, 2021) being central to enhancing the life design and career capability development of service users (Pouyaud, 2016; Robertson, 2015; Robertson & Picard, 2021) .",

Egdell and Robertson (2021) argued that a lack of sociological analysis of conversion factors discussed in Sen's capability approach is not favourable for informing the design of career interventions and turning resources into positive career-related outcomes. Hart and colleagues (Hart, 2016; Hart & Brando, 2018; Hart et al., 2014) proposed two core capabilities, namely, the capability to aspire and the capability to realize aspirations as important components to operationalize the capability approach to working with children in school or educational settings. Both Edgell and Graham (2017) and Robertson (2018) highlighted the importance of taking unpaid work and interest-based activities as alternative meaningful options for enhancing the design and delivery of career support services targeted at marginalized youth. This implies that there is a need to acknowledge the experience of NEET youth involved in these activities largely unrecognized by mainstream society, expand their sources of exposure, experience and recognition, and enhance their life-design capability to develop a career pathway most preferred by themselves. Yet, empirical research needs to explore whether the capabilities to aspire and realize aspirations are also crucial for marginalized youth's career capability development in community settings and how the capability approach can inform the design and implementation of career support services for NEET youth with additional vulnerability in particular.",

The development of the experience-driven framework is based on the expanded notion of work (ENOW) model (Wong, 2015) , which unpacks the notion of work into six different categories of paid and unpaid work. Paid work is of two categories, namely, a) employment and entrepreneurship, and b) work trials, paid internship, and trial-run business. The world of unpaid work is of a wider spectrum, the first of which is vocational education and training, and other work exposure programmes. The next two are volunteering activities largely organized by NGOs, and provisioning undertaken in non-organizational contexts such as selfcare, family care and neighbourhood care. The last one is serious leisure theorized as an intensive and committed pursuit of a leisure-time activity (Stebbins, 2017) such as street dancing, online game playing, music busking, among many others. The ENOW model shows that both formal and informal economic activities (Watts, 2015) are the constituent and transferable elements of the holistic landscape of work and work experiences (Wong & Yip, 2019) .",

When NEET youth fail to achieve self-recognition and social recognition, it is difficult for them to initiate changes by taking autonomous actions. The journey of struggling for recognition (Honneth, 1996) will become an insurmountable one if sustainable support from different stakeholders such as parents, helping professionals, employers and mentors is not available. Against the sociocultural background that paid work is much highly valued over unpaid work in mainstream discourse, the ENOW model is operationalized by an experience-driven framework to inform the design, delivery and evaluation of career support services. This is particularly relevant to late-modern societies such as Hong Kong where academic achievements and paid work experiences have a strong cultural value attached to them, whereas unpaid work experiences, and hobbies, leisure and interests are often viewed as a distraction for making a smooth transition to further study or work. The experiencedriven framework emphasizes the importance of acknowledging the untold experiences of unpaid work undertaken by NEET youth clients and the strategic role of enriching and reviewing their participation in a wide spectrum of interest-and workbased activities as a solid ground for pursuing their career aspirations (Wong & Yip, 2019) . All this is helpful to facilitate youth clients to identify what they value for life, navigate a relevant career pathway, and thus enjoy freedom from merely following the conventional career roadmap leading to success. The experience-driven framework incorporates two crucial elements for practicing the capability approach to enhance the life-design capability of youth clients, namely, co-construction of a zone of aspired development and mobilizing support from more enabling others.",

In the project, the term MKO refers to those older adults, mentors or peers who are more knowledgeable, capable and experienced than individual learners in a certain area of interest, trade or industry.

The term zone of aspired development (ZAD) refers to the move of young people from the ZPD to another zone in which young people with aspirations are able to navigate their career pathway ahead in spite of anticipating confronting risks and uncertainties. In the ZAD with growing adventures and aspirations, young people are keen on building up aspirations and taking up future-informed actions to develop capabilities to realize their aspirations by proactively seeking and making good use of resources, opportunities and networks. The involvement of more enabling others (MEO) is helpful to facilitate youth clients to make a move from the ZPD to the ZAD. Unlike the counterparts of MKO, more enabling others are not necessarily more knowledgeable than the youth clients in a certain area of interest or trade such as music or bakery. MEO are instead committed to facilitating youth to build up their aspirations, provide useful information for their informed career decision-making and/or bridge them up with more resources, opportunities and networks for pursuing their preferred career pathway . As shown in Figure 1 below, career practitioners can provide the four domains of experience-driven career interventions, namely, recognition, exposures, self-growth and transferability for facilitating youth clients to make a move from the ZPD to their preferred ZAD and leveraging the involvement of more enabling others as resourceful persons or mentors.",

Acknowledging that NEET youth is a heterogeneous group with or without additional vulnerabilities, Su et al., (2020a, b) revealed that they had one thing in common, i.e. lack of both self-and social recognition following the imposition of a stigmatizing NEET label on themselves and the consequent under-recognition and misrecognition of their prior and current interest and unpaid work experiences. This study revealed that NEET youth with additional single or multiple vulnerabilities might fail to define a roadmap for their career and development or fall into the state of helplessness and hopelessness. There is no dispute to the emphasis of using lifedesign dialogue and conversations to deconstruct limiting narratives and beliefs held by the clients, and co-constructing new narratives for formulating subsequent action plans for enhancing reflection and realizing aspirations (Guichard, 2018; Savickas, 2012 ). Yet, the capability approach also takes the provision of an enabling environment being central to supporting the capability development of marginalized NEET youth with additional vulnerability/vulnerabilities particularly in view of their limited sources of recognition. The findings of the study suggested that the stigmatizing label of NEET and the absence of a promising resume should not function as barriers for facilitating youth clients to articulate their untold and suppressed stories of unique outcomes that could inform the replotting of empowering narratives. Using the experience-driven framework for showing acknowledgement and recognition of prior clientele interest and experiences is different from the problematic story plots constructed and pursued along the line of victim blaming (Blustein et al., 2018) . Following the experience-driven framework informed by the capability approach, career practitioners are to support NEET youth with or without vulnerabilities to construct, deconstruct, reconstruct and co-construct their life stories and narratives (Savickas, 2015) with the provision of resources, opportunities and networks available from the engagement of multiple stakeholders.",

As shown from the above analysis, these youth participants failed to develop two crucial career capabilities that can enable them to live and realize a life they value, namely, capability to aspire and capability to realize aspiration. Moreover, the findings of the study showed that the capability to aspire is not a one-off task but an ongoing one characterized by dynamics and complexity in search of both self-and social recognition along the user journey and beyond.

Informed by the insights from Edgell and Graham (2017) and Robertson (2018) , this is the first ever study using an experience-driven framework with four domains of experiences, and examining how the framework functioned to enhance the career capabilities of those NEET youth pushed to the margin of society. Experience-driven recognition serves not only as a starting point for the acknowledgement of prior and current experiences but also as a key component across all three other domains of experiences leading to experience-driven exposures, self-growth and transferability. Enhanced self-and social recognition can motivate youth clients to welcome new, interactive exposures, enjoy self-growth and realize the transfer of values, attitudes, skills and knowledge from one sphere to another as appropriate. Exposures to new, interactive and interest-or work-based experiences may lead to self-growth and vice versa. For example, all along the user journey, Andy developed not only a coherent narrative of mindset, heartset and skillset (e.g. Heto & Indangasi, 2020) in music performance and music production, but also the readiness to build up a stronger capability to facilitate peers and new comers to ignite their serious interest in music as his career. Except young mothers such as Wincy who could manage to immediately apply what she had learned from the playgroup assistant programme to her daily parenting and provisioning tasks within the domestic context, transferability was usually materialized upon approaching the end of user journey. With support from career practitioners, youth participants were able to review what they had learned from the project, and applied or transferred what they had learned beyond their user journey as appropriate.",

Acknowledging prior and current interest and unpaid work experiences of youth in their zone of proximal development can help enhance trust building for paving the way for transitioning to the zone of aspired development and expanding the sources of experience favourable for expanding the base and sources of recognition, self-growth and transferability throughout and beyond the user journey.",

We therefore need to be cautious about drawing any definite conclusions regarding the transferability of research findings to other different types of vulnerability such as physical disability, mental health challenges and visual disability. As the duration spent by youth as NEET is an important indicator to address the needs of NEET youth , future studies are needed to investigate how shorter duration and longer duration spent by youth as NEET with or without additional vulnerabilities influence the application of the experience-driven framework. Finally, the experience-driven framework was only adopted by the project in working with NEET youth in community settings, future studies are in need to study the extent to which this experience-driven framework is applicable to school settings or to other age groups such as younger or older adults with regard to strengthening their career capabilities and life design.",
