These devices, which consist of embedded sensors and processors that can handle their internal states or the external environment around them have become part of people's daily necessities because of their decreasing cost, mobility and increasing computational capability. IoT includes a great diversity of smart devices collaborating to bring convenience and accessibility to people's lives [1] . The benefits of IoT are immense and its applications are revolutionizing the manner in which we work and live. It also generates new opportunities for innovation, growth and knowledge sharing between different entities [2] . With a sharp increase in the number of IoT devices, these interconnected smart devices can be deployed in a variety of fields and their applications include but are not limited to smart homes, smart cities, environment, agriculture, smart grid, industry, healthcare, and transport. Application domains of the IoT are illustrated in Figure 1 .",

            "text": "However, the low power and limited computing capacity constraints do not allow sophisticated security policies on IoT devices. The large number of interconnected IoT devices provokes a rapid increase in attacks from adversaries. With far inadequate awareness of IoT device users and vendors on the perils of IoT security, these IoT devices, in turn, are becoming a source of potential risks. Attackers can gain control of certain internal and open environments by accessing and probing into IoT devices (e.g., water outages, shortage of public electronic supply and tampering with the functionality of devices). Such security threats are concerning [3] ; a house attached to any IoT device is an open invitation to attackers. In light of the above-mentioned security risks for IoT devices, it is vital to have proper access control in order to protect user privacy and prevent on-device data from being leaked [4] . Passwords used to be the only way of user authentication in the IoT, but times have changed. In the past decade, biometric technology has developed in leaps and bounds and has swiftly spread to almost every corner of our daily lives as a more reliable method of authentication. With the popularity of smartphones, it is a winning combination of mobile phones and biometrics in the consumer market, allowing biometric authentication to be more widely accepted. Since Apple started its incredibly usable biometric recognition, named Touch ID, in 2013 [5] , the application of biometrics has expanded rapidly. Currently, IoT devices mounted with biometric modules are standalone products in the market. A recent biometric technology market data report published by ABI Research forecast that biometric recognition systems in smartphones would grow significantly to make a 95 percent penetration rate of smartphone shipments by 2022 [6] . Biometric recognition uses physical traits of human beings (e.g., fingerprint and face) for identification or verification. It overcomes the drawback of password-based authentication [8] and is becoming more prevalent with advancements in sensing technologies. Although biometric systems are advantageous over traditional password-based authentication, biometric information stored as template data in central databases or smart devices is vulnerable because any individual's biometric traits cannot be changed or reissued, similar to passwords. Once biometric template data are compromised, the effect is forever, and privacy infringement and security breaches are likely to occur. If an adversary gains access to IoT devices using stolen biometric templates, it can put sensitive data or records stored in the devices at serious risk. Therefore, the importance of protecting biometric template data is twofold. First, user identity should be protected such that original biometric information cannot be retrieved. Second, users' private data or sensitive information stored in IoT devices should only be accessed by genuine users.",

Security principles, such as confidentiality, integrity, availability, authentication, lightweight solutions, key management systems and policies, should be implemented to enable a secure communication architecture [14] . Due to the variety of devices and communication protocols in an IoT setting as well as the diverse interfaces and services available in IoT, it is inappropriate to implement security mitigation based on conventional IT network solutions. Security measures (e.g., authentication through cryptographically pre-shared keys) currently utilized in traditional networks may not be adequate [16] . There are many attacks targeting IoT systems of a typical three-layer architecture, which is composed of the perception layer, network layer and application layer [17] . Vulnerabilities of or possible attacks to each layer [2] and security requirements in each layer [18] are listed in Table 1 and expounded in this section. Table 1 .

In the verification phase, the query's biometric features are extracted in the same way as the enrollment phase and then compared against the template data in the matching module. If the similarity score between the template data and query data is larger than a predefined threshold, the verification is successful; otherwise, it is unsuccessful.

In this study, the Raspberry Pi is used as a remote node and the enrolled biometric information (e.g., fingerprint data) is encrypted by a cryptographic algorithm and stored in the cloud. Prakash and Venkatram [27] enhanced home-IoT security using biometric authentication. In this paper, a fingerprint-based authentication system is implemented with Raspberry Pi together with several types of sensors. Taheri and Yuan [28] developed a cross-layer biometric recognition system that includes both software and hardware layers in a chaining structure. In this work, biometrics (e.g., fingerprint) is adopted. Sarika et al. [29] proposed a door lock system using fingerprints to unlock doors. The proposed system is composed of a fingerprint scanner, a magnetic solenoid lock, an Arduino board, and an LCD. This system is considered a good replacement of keys, locks, and cards and brings convenience and efficiency to organizations such as banks. Golec et al. [31] presented a biometric scheme named BioSec to provide user authentication for edge devices in IoT and Industry 4.0. Specifically, fingerprint-based biometrics are utilized in BioSec, and fingerprint data is secured in both the transmission channel and the database using the standard symmetric encryption method.",

When the received biometric data cannot match the stored template, the system assesses whether the patient suffers a heart attack and if so, an alarm is triggered at the server and a notification is issued to the hospital system. In comparison with passwordbased or two-factor authentication methods, Lu et al. [42] explored finger-vein-based user authentication to achieve a more secure IoT environment. In the proposed scheme, an efficient local descriptor, called histogram of competitive orientations and magnitudes, is used to represent the finger-vein patterns in finger-vein impressions.

Not only are the keystroke dynamics used at the beginning of a session, but they are continuously checked to monitor the user's status. In the proposed method, a penaltyand-reward function is designed. If a user types as they should, then they earn a reward, leading to an increase in the trust level. However, if the typing of the user does not comply with the template, a penalty is given, causing the trust level to decrease and the system's confidence in the user's authenticity to decrease. The user will be locked out of the system if the trust level is lower than a threshold. Mondal and Bours [69] designed a continuous authentication system using mouse dynamics. In this work, the authors employed a public mouse dynamics dataset containing 49 users together with six machine learning algorithms (e.g., support vector machine and decision tree learning) to evaluate the proposed system. Temper et al. [70] developed a fuzzy classifier-based continuous authentication system aiming to secure mobile devices. The proposed system uses behavioral biometric traits (e.g., touchscreen gestures) as unique features for authentication. Experimental results show that the proposed system achieves an EER of 11.5% on a private dataset, collected from 22 different users. Traor\u00e9 et al. [71] presented a continuous authentication framework to address the threat of cheating in online tests.

Token-based authentication (according to something you have) performs authentication with a token, which is a secure storage device that contains passwords or generates one-time passcodes [72] . Unlike traditional password-and token-based authentication, biometric authentication uses features from human biometric traits (e.g., fingerprint, face, and iris) for authentication purposes. A biometric trait is unique to its owner; thus, it cannot be shared or stolen, an attribute passwords and tokens do not have [73] . Moreover, biometrics have the property of nonrepudiation. This property ensures that a user participating in a transaction cannot subsequently reject it as unauthorized or claim not to have participated in the transaction [72] .",

In password-and tokenbased authentication, users may blame themselves for authentication failure. However, for biometric-based authentication systems, because of biometric uncertainty, although a user is not at any fault, the system can still reject the user [72] .

Therefore, user privacy protection is becoming more important, calling for attention and action from both academia and industry. In addition, according to a survey conducted by Chuang and Lei [86] , most existing mutual authentication and key agreement schemes cannot simultaneously meet all the requirements, such as security, user anonymity, public key management, and independent authentication. Therefore, more effort is required to design better biometric authentication and key agreement systems.",

In the IoT environment, many IoT devices are unmanned and not equipped with liveness detection. For instance, the Touch ID of an iPhone can be fooled by a fake fingerprint film made from glue [95] . Since multi-modal biometric authentication systems are more robust than their unimodal counterparts [96] , incorporating multi-modal biometrics can mitigate the threat of spoofing attacks because it is more difficult to spoof two or more modalities than a single one [97] . However, multi-modal biometric systems are not the ideal remedy for spoofing attacks given the resource limitation of IoT devices. Using the biometric traits possessing the liveness property (e.g., ECG) can be a better option [89] , but it still depends on specific IoT applications because, in most applications, sensors may not be equipped with the ECG collection function. At point (6) , attacks such as stealing or modifying biometric templates have severe consequences on users' privacy. This is because biometric template data are uniquely linked to users' identity and biometric traits cannot be revoked or reset similar to passwords or tokens. In the IoT context, with a large amount of sensitive data (including biometric data) collected and stored on IoT devices or servers, the privacy concern is more critical and security requirements are more demanding. Moreover, the IoT architecture is intended for automation without human intervention, making the task of protecting sensitive and important information (e.g., biometric templates) more challenging [98] .",

The second reason is that often the currently available biometric-cryptographic techniques (e.g., fuzzy commitment and fuzzy vault) cannot be directly applied to the feature sets formed in the unencrypted domain. This is because these techniques require fixed-length feature representations [100] in order to measure feature disparity using metrics such as hamming distance or set difference, but converting raw biometric data collected by IoT devices to the required formats not only creates extra computational load, but also likely decreases authentication accuracy.",

Using the most common biometric authentication, fingerprint recognition, as an example, when a contact sensor is used to capture live finger images, nonlinear distortion and rotation of fingerprints are inevitable due to skin elasticity, skin moisture content, finger displacement, contact pressure, sensor noise and imaging methodology [101] . Because of the uncertainty in the captured fingerprint data, matching between query and template fingerprints could fail. Therefore, biometric authentication is inherently a probabilistic task and there is inevitable uncertainty and the risk of error, although the technology and the system itself behave as designed.

The anonymous technology can be utilized to handle user-identifiable information, but we need to balance the efficacy of privacy protection with the accuracy of results [102] . To achieve this goal, privacy-preserving techniques, such as cancelable biometrics [103] and homomorphic encryption [104] , are effective methods in the latest research outcomes. For cancelable biometrics, in the enrollment phase, instead of storing the original biometric data, they are transformed by a non-invertible transformation function to achieve template data protection. In the verification phase, the same non-invertible transform is applied to the query data. Matching between the template and query data is conducted in the transformed domain to reduce the risk of biometric data leakage [105] . Homomorphic encryption is a technique that enables mathematic operations on encrypted data without the involvement of the decryption key. This allows the confidentiality of biometric data to be protected and matching to be performed between encrypted template data and encrypted query data without degrading recognition accuracy. As long as the decryption key is safe, the system is cryptographically secure [106] .",

As an extension of cloud computing, edge computing has experienced fast development. The use of edge computing in the IoT may solve issues of cloud computing (e.g., processing of a huge amount of data and/or a long distance between servers and users) by placing small edge servers between the users and the cloud.

Attention is paid to the authentication and encryption aspects of biometric-based systems for the sake of IoT security. Regarding authentication, contemporary biometric systems are discussed and categorized into single-modal or multi-modal biometric authentication systems based on the types and number of biometric traits used. Regarding encryption, bio-cryptosystems utilizing different cryptographic techniques are reviewed. We emphasize that each biometric trait or a combination of traits has strengths as well as noteworthy shortcomings. Moreover, despite the significant advantages of applying biometrics to safeguarding IoT security, potential challenges are highlighted, and possible solutions are presented. To overcome the challenges identified, the authors suggest the following future research directions:",

Moreover, although multi-modal biometric systems can reduce the effect of biometric uncertainty and bring about higher authentication accuracy than single-modal biometric systems, the extra cost incurred (e.g., additional processing and computing time) should be taken into consideration. Due to the resource limitations of IoT devices, how to design efficient and cost-effective multi-modal biometric systems is a much-needed research topic. For example, capturing iris and face biometrics simultaneously saves data collection time and brings convenience to users; \u2022",

To the best of our knowledge thus far, there has been little study on this issue in the IoT field; thus, urgent research activities are required to defy spoofing attacks to IoT devices, especially in IoT applications with no human intervention; \u2022 Despite its importance, biometrics for IoT security is a relatively new research area, evidenced by the limited number of articles that can be found in the literature. Given the resource constraints of IoT devices and the issue of user acceptability and/or convenience of collecting biometrics, it is necessary to develop lightweight authentication schemes, preferably with functions such as template data protection or key management so as to strengthen system security. Moreover, a user-friendly course of action is another critical factor to encourage public acceptance of biometrics in the IoT. We believe that the key to the widespread deployment of biometric systems in the IoT is to strike the right balance between privacy and convenience.
