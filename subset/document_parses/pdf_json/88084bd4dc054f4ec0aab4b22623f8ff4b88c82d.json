The immunologic determinants of this risk, the duration of infectiousness, and optimal treatment and prevention strategies in immunocompromised hosts are ill-defined. Of additional concern is the widespread use of immunosuppressive medications (corticosteroids, IL-6 antagonists) to treat COVID-19, which may enhance and prolong viral replication in the context of immunodeficiency. We outline the rationale for four inter-related approaches to usher in an era of evidence-based medicine for optimal management of immunocompromised patients with COVID-19: 1) multicenter pathogenesis and outcomes studies to relate the risk of severe disease to the type and degree of immunodeficiency; 2) studies evaluating immunologic responses to SARS-CoV-2 vaccines;",

In a multicenter study of over 400 solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients with COVID-19, 78%, 34%, and 27% required hospitalization, intensive care, and mechanical ventilation, respectively [1] . Hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) recipients also experience high rates of COVID-19-related complications, with up to 15% of patients requiring intubation [2] . Additionally, some studies have shown that mortality rates of SOT and HCT recipients with COVID-19 range between 20% and 30%, respectively [1, 2] , although more recent studies of SOT recipients, including a study showing comparable outcomes between SOT recipients and non-SOT controls [3] , have shown lower mortality rates (4.4-9.6%) [3, 4] . Patients with solid tumors, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, and primary immunodeficiencies are also at high risk for severe outcomes, intubation, and death [5, 6] . By contrast, data in patients receiving immunosuppression or biologic agents for rheumatological and autoimmune conditions are more reassuring, with many studies showing clinical outcomes similar to those of the general population [5] .",

Fifty percent (7/14) of patients had an underlying hematological malignancy [8-10, 13, 14] . The remaining predisposing conditions were SOT (N=2) [12, 15] , advanced HIV (CD4 count = 0 cells/mm 3 ) [15] , antiphospholipid syndrome (receiving prednisone, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab) [11] , prostate cancer [17] , rheumatoid arthritis (receiving rituximab) [15] , and Xlinked agammaglobulinemia (N=1 each) [16] . Pneumonia was present in most patients, and SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses were minimal to absent. [8, 9, 11, 13, 14] . Many of these mutations, such as deletions at residues 69-70 and 141-144 of the S-gene NTD and the E484K and N501Y mutations in the RBD would later be identified in late 2020 in the heavily mutated SAR-CoV-2 lineages B.1.1.7, B.1.351 and P.1, first reported in the United Kingdom, South African, and Brazil, respectively [18] . That these variants emerged independently and were first identified in immunocompromised hosts in mid-2020 has led some to propose that their origin was in individuals with prolonged infection. These highly-mutated variants are thought to be transmitted more efficiently because of greater affinity of the mutated Spike proteins to the ACE2 receptor. The mutated variants may also be less sensitive to neutralization by monoclonal antibodies [19] and sera from convalescent donors [14] or from recent A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t 5 vaccinees [20] . It has also been proposed that NTD deletions in the S gene emerged as a result of immune selection following administration of convalescent plasma [14] , though this observation has not been universal [10] .",

We recommend that test-based strategies similar to those proposed by revised CDC guidelines [21] be implemented even if the frequency and duration of prolonged infectiousness has yet to be completely characterized, as such interventions have the potential to prevent transmission of SARS-CoV-2 variants to healthcare workers and others.

Furthermore, the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of these vaccines are likely to be lower than those of immunocompetent individuals, thereby putting vaccinated immunocompromised patients at continued risk for \"breakthrough\" SARS-CoV-2 infection [23] .

Additionally, a study of 67 hematological malignancy patients who had received two mRNA vaccine doses showed that 46% of individuals failed to produce antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein [26] , a finding which contrasts with the essentially 100% seroconversion rate seen in phase 1 and 2 mRNA vaccine trials of healthy volunteers [27] . In contrast, patients with autoimmune diseases appear to have robust responses to mRNA COVID-19 vaccines, with up to 74% of patients developing antibody responses after one vaccine dose, although the use of anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies or mycophenolate was associated with vaccine failure [28] .

The concept of immunomodulation has been solidified by clinical trial data demonstrating a mortality benefit of interleukin-6 inhibitor therapy (e.g., tocilizumab or sarilumab) in non-mechanically ventilated critically ill patients with COVID-19. As a result, there has been strong interest in the continued study of immunomodulatory drugs to treat COVID-19. A multitude of immunosuppressive medications are being evaluated (generally as adjuncts to dexamethasone), such as interleukin-1 or tumor necrosis alpha inhibitors, and other cytokine inhibitors and immunomodulators. Current guidelines endorse the use of dexamethasone and IL-6 inhibitor therapy in subgroups of patients with COVID-19 without excluding immunocompromised patients [35] , even though these patients were generally excluded from Studies among immunocompromised hosts should ideally be focused on identifying direct-acting antivirals that markedly reduce SARS-CoV-2 replication, be they small molecules or antibodies. The use of monoclonal antibodies, which are already available for administration to both immunocompromised and immunocompetent patients in the U.S. via an EUA, should now be expanded via clinical trials to encompass settings (e.g., early hospitalization, supplement oxygen requirement in patients with prolonged replication) beyond those outlined in the EUA, with a focus on immunocompromised patients who may benefit the most from them. Although the efficacy of the RNA polymerase inhibitor remdesivir has been questioned due to conflicting data [37, 38] , remdesivir and other antivirals such as molnupiravir (NCT04405739) should also be studied in clinical trials of immunocompromised hosts, who may reap the greatest benefit from such interventions. Indeed, while some have argued that the antiviral oseltamivir may only have modest efficacy against influenza, transplant recipients with influenza who are treated with oseltamivir have a significantly reduced risk of lower tract disease, hypoxemia, intensive care unit admission, and death [39] .",

Variability in the duration of infectious virus shedding has been noted, and larger studies are needed to better define the duration of and risk factors for prolonged shedding of infectious virus. Perhaps the most striking feature of protracted infection in immunocompromised patients is intra-host viral evolution and generation of multiply-mutated viruses. Several studies have shown the emergence of deletions in the N-terminal domain (NTD) of the spike glycoprotein gene (S gene) and mutations in the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the S gene and in other regions of the SARS-CoV-2 genome, all within the same host in the absence of reinfection",

By contrast, antiviral development appears slower, perhaps due to the lag time needed to discover and develop new small molecule inhibitors that are potent, safe, and effective.

Additionally, clinical trial data of the downstream consequences of aggressive immunomodulatory therapy on the risk of opportunistic infections with antimicrobial-resistant bacteria, invasive fungi and viruses are lacking [34, 36].
