Pulmonary consolidations developed in the lungs of the patients are imperative factors during prognosis and diagnosis. Existing Deep Learning techniques demonstrate promising results in analyzing X-ray images when employed with Transfer Learning. However, Transfer Learning has its inherent limitations, which can be prevaricated by employing the Progressive Resizing technique. The Progressive Resizing technique reuses old computations while learning new ones in Convolution Neural Networks (CNN), enabling it to incorporate prior knowledge of the feature hierarchy. The proposed classification model can classify pulmonary consolidation into normal, pneumonia, and SARS-CoV-2 classes by analyzing X-rays images. The method exhibits substantial enhancement in classification results when the Transfer Learning technique is applied in consultation with the Progressive Resizing technique on EfficientNet CNN. The customized VGG-19 model attained benchmark scores in all evaluation criteria over the baseline VGG-19 model. GradCam based feature interpretation, coupled with X-ray visual analysis, facilitates improved assimilation of the scores.

In November 2019, a similar viral outbreak with a lower respiratory tract febrile illness was reported in China. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) test analysis highlighted an unfamiliar coronavirus strain responsible for the outbreak.

A nasopharyngeal Exudate swab sample is screened in the RT-PCR test. However, the RTPCR test's reliability with higher turnaround time poses a challenge in diagnosis, especially in developing nations due to limited medical facilities. As the infections in the lungs can be screened with radiographs, the radiographs are being used in the diagnostic workup, check disease progression, and followup of the pulmonary consolidations. Since the coronavirus consolidation is dissimilar to bacterial or viral pneumonia consolidation, the radiographs help identify the COVID-19 infection. The chest X-ray findings can improve the diagnosis time-cycle with enhanced screening capability. It also helps to prioritize the treatments of the patients at hospitals.

We carried out studies on the work published by various research groups. We have carried out a comparative analysis, which brings out the dataset insights, a number of classes, type of Deep Learning models, and performance of these experiments, and details are covered in Table 1 . Most of the work has been done on small-sized datasets due to the inadequate availability of annotated Chest X-Rays. However, some of these research groups have used augmented/selective Chest X-Ray images. We also studied data augmentation techniques used in different variants of the investigation. The majority of the published work incorporates two or three-class classification with binary classification. We have analyzed various CNN models by studying their performance scores and the methodology. Since the Convolution Neural Networks (CNN) do not have predefined kernels and learn locally from connected neurons representing data-specific kernels, the CNN filters can be applied repeatedly to the images to classify the X-ray images. We conclude from the study that suitable CNNs can be employed to carry out multi-class classification with an unskewed balanced dataset. We propose the Transfer learning technique's employment on the X-Ray databases. The technique enhances learning new tasks and enables improved classification by transferring learned knowledge from relevant classification datasets. We first train a baseline COnvolution Neural Network on a base dataset with the defined task. After obtaining the weights, we repurpose the learned features by transferring this knowledge to a target (X-ray analysis) model, which will be trained on the X-ray dataset. Transfer Learning helped reduce training time and improve neural network performance. However, this technique also suffers from inherent limitations of negative transfer and overfitting. We propose a novel implementation methodology by amalgamating the Progres-sive Learning technique with the Transfer Learning technique to circumvent the limitations. The Progressive Resizing technique reuses old computations while learning new ones in Convolution Neural Networks (CNN), which enables it to incorporate prior knowledge of the feature hierarchy [18] . The paper proposes a novel methodology to detect the COVID-19 pulmonary consolidations in X-ray images with a method to interpret the CNN analysis with intuitive Saliency maps (GradCam) Visualisation.

Hence, the use of mutitudinal and multimodal is done while designing a robust AI model [14] . There is a bright possibility of increasing diagnostic results using different clinical data of the same patients, i.e., Electronic Health Record (EHRs), computerized tomography (CT) scans, and Chest X-rays. However, the availability of such a dataset for making an AI model is a challenge. Hence, we have carefully studied the chest X-Rays to formulate our experiments. We used the X-ray Imaging dataset of the COVID-19 patients for the experiments, which was curated by Dr. Joseph Cohen of the University of Montreal, Canada [9] . The dataset incorporates Normal, and COVID-19 infected X-Ray images. We used the COVIDx Dataset of the COVID-Net Team (Vision and Image Processing Research Group), University of Waterloo, and Darwin AI Corp, Canada [19] . The X-Ray imaging dataset consists of 16,756 chest radiography images, including 66 X-ray images of COVID-19. High skewing observed in the quantity of X-ray appertaining to Normal, Pneumonia, and COVID-19 classes may impact the classification scores while training CNNs. Hence, we created a balanced, relevant dataset in consultation with a radiologist to carry out experiments for multi-class classification. The composite dataset has 100 X-rays each in healthy and pneumonia classes and 104 X-ray images of the COVID-19 class.",

We carried out modifications to the baseline VGG-19 model to attain improved results. In VGG-19 baseline model, 'Backbone'-convolution layers analyse the X-ray consolidation features. These layers are dovetailed by culminating linear layers, referred to as 'Head.' 'Head' translates the analyzed features during generating prediction scores for two classes in binary classification. To reduce the learning time and optimize the learning of the CNNs, we employed differential learning rates. We split the head from the rest of the architecture layers and ran the experiments on 'Backbone.' To carry out relevant modifications in VGG-19 architecture, we replaced the 'Head' with the AdaptiveConcatPool layer with Flatten Layer, blocks of Batch Normalization, Dropout, Linear, and ReLU layers. We appended two units with softmax activation as a fully connected layer referenced as -'Final Classification Layer .' This AdaptiveConcatPool Layer effectively preserves the backbone's feature representations compared to using only the MaxPool Layer or the AveragePool Layer in the 'Head.' Fig. 3 shows a novel modified VGG-19 architecture which demonstrated a substantial upsurge in outcomes.",

In comparison to the EfficieintNet-B3 model, the higher versions do not yield any relevant outcomes. Hence, detailed experiments were undertaken with the EfficientNet B1, EfficientNet B2, and EfficientNet B3 architectures. Due to significant yield accrued while experimenting on the EfficientNet-B3, we carried out binary and multi-class classification on both X-ray datasets. We trained EfficientNet CNN on 64x64 sized X-ray imaging dataset initially to obtain the weights using Progressive resizing technique [27] . These weights were transferred to the resized 128 x 128 Imaging dataset and followed by this; similar iterations were conducted repetitively by gradually increasing X-ray sizes to 256 x 256, 512 x 512. As each larger-scale model incorporated the weights from the previous iteration, it could extract more relevant features and hence demonstrated improved classification scores. This methodology yields significant results by following the strategy.
