In this context, both data collection on sexual contact networks and the modeling of disease spreading, are intensively contributing to the search for effective immunization policies. Here, the spreading of sexually transmitted diseases on bipartite scale-free graphs, representing heterosexual contact networks, is considered. We analytically derive the expression for the epidemic threshold and its dependence with the system size in finite populations. We show that the epidemic outbreak in bipartite populations, with number of sexual partners distributed as in empirical observations from national sex surveys, takes place for larger spreading rates than for the case in which the bipartite nature of the network is not taken into account. Numerical simulations confirm the validity of the theoretical results. Our findings indicate that the restriction to crossed infections between the two classes of individuals (males and females) has to be taken into account in the design of efficient immunization strategies for sexually transmitted diseases.",

On the one hand, epidemiologists have developed mathematical models that can be used as a guide to understanding how an epidemic spreads and to design immunization and vaccination policies [1, 2, 3]. On the other hand, data collections have provided information on the local patterns of relationships in a population. In particular, persons who may have come into contact with an infectious individual are identified and diagnosed, making it possible to contact-trace the way the epidemic spreads, and to validate the mathematical models. However, up to a few years ago, some of the assumptions at the basis of the theoretical models were difficult to test. This is the case, for instance, of the complete network of contacts -the backbone through which the diseases are transmitted. With the advent of modern society, fast transportation systems have changed human habits, and some diseases that just a few years ago would have produced local outbreaks, are nowadays a global threat for public health systems. A recent example is given by the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), that spread very fast from Asia to North America a few years ago [4, 5, 6] . Therefore, it is of utmost importance to carefully take into account as much details as possible of the structural properties of the network on which the infection dynamics occurs.",

            "text": "Strikingly, a large number of statistical properties have been found to be common in the topology of real-world social, biological and technological networks [7, 8, 9] . Of particular relevance because of its ubiquity in nature, is the class of complex networks referred to as scale-free (SF) networks. In SF networks, the number of contacts or connections of a node with other nodes in the system, the degree (or connectivity) k, follows a power law distribution, P k \u223c k \u2212\u03b3 . Recent studies have shown the importance of the SF topology on the dynamics and function of the system under study [7, 8, 9] . For instance, SF networks are very robust to random failures, but at the same time extremely fragile to targeted attacks of the highly connected nodes [10, 11] . In the context of disease spreading, SF contact networks lead to a vanishing epidemic threshold in the limit of infinite population when \u03b3 \u2264 3 [12, 13, 14, 15] . This is because the exponent \u03b3 is directly related to the first and second moment of the degree distribution, k and k 2 , and the ratio k / k 2 determines the epidemic threshold above which the outbreak occurs. When 2 < \u03b3 \u2264 3, k is finite while k 2 goes to infinity, that is, the transmission probability required for the infection to spread goes to zero. Conversely, when \u03b3 > 3, there is a finite threshold and the epidemic survives only when the spreading rate is above a certain critical value. The concept of a critical epidemic threshold is central in epidemiology. Its absence in SF networks with 2 < \u03b3 \u2264 3 has a number of important implications in terms of prevention policies: if diseases can spread and persist even in the case of vanishingly small transmission probabilities, then prevention campaigns where individuals are randomly chosen for vaccination are not much effective [12, 13, 14, 15] .",

Current approaches are either individual-based simulations [18] or metapopulation models where network simulations are carried out through a detailed stratification of the population and infection dynamics [20] . In the particular case of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), infections occur within the unique context of sexual encounters, and the network of contacts [19, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26] is a critical ingredient of any theoretical framework. Unfortunately, ascertaining complete sexual contact networks in significatively large populations is extremely difficult.

In the following we will consider a graph with N M nodes, representing males, characterized by the exponent \u03b3 M , and N M nodes, representing females, characterized by \u03b3 F . Concerning the choice of the couple of exponents from those reported in Table I , one must be careful that different STDs have different associated (recovery) time scales, and that the spreading is based on the assumption that the links are concurrent on the time scale of the disease. In this sense, the exponents extracted from one-year data seem better suited to most of the STDs, being HIV an important exception. However, during the lifetime of sexually active individuals, sexual behavior is likely to change due to changes in residence, marital status, age-linked sexual attitudes, etc [27] . We thus prefer to use life-cycle data collections, that integrate all these patterns and can consequently be regarded as better statistical indicators. After all, the values reported in Table I indicate that both one-year and cumulative data produce exponents in the same range.",

This result is good news and highlights the importance of incorporating the crossed infections scheme in the propagation of STDs. However, as shown in Table I , most of the real networks have at least one exponent \u03b3 G (G = F, M ) smaller than 3. This means that, in most of the practical cases, the two epidemic thresholds vanish as the system size goes to infinity, no matter the formulation used to model the disease propagation. On the other hand, real populations are finite and thus the degree distributions have a finite variance regardless of the exponents.

Table  II reports the expression of these two exponents as a function of \u03b3 F and \u03b3 M , showing that \u03b1 * is always smaller than \u03b1. In particular, for the most common case (see Table I ), i.e. when one degree distribution exponent is in the range ]2, 3], and the other one is larger than 3, the value of \u03b1 * found for bipartite networks is two times smaller than \u03b1. As a consequence, the results show that in finite bipartite populations the onset of the epidemic takes place at larger values of the spreading rate. In other words, it could be the case that for a given transmission probability, in the unipartite representation shown in Fig. 1 (b) the epidemic would have survived infecting a fraction of the population, while when only crossed infections are allowed, as in Fig. 1 (a) , the same disease would not have produced an endemic state. Moreover, the difference between the epidemic thresholds predicted by the two approaches increases with the system size. This dependency is shown in Fig. 2, where we have reported, as a function of the system size, the critical thresholds obtained by numerically solving Eqs. (5) and (6) with the values of \u03b3 M and \u03b3 F found for the lifetime distribution of sexual partners in Sweden [21] and U.K [22, 23] .",

Bipartite and unipartite graphs of a given size are built up (see Methods section) having the same degree distributions, P M k and P F k , and thus they only differ in the way the nodes are linked. A fraction of infected individuals is initially randomly placed on the network and the SIS dynamics is evolved: at each time step susceptible individuals get infected with probability \u03bd if they are connected to an infectious one, and get recovered with probability \u00b5 = 1 (hence, the effective transmission probability is \u03bb = \u03bd). After a transient time, the system reaches a stationary state where the total prevalence of the disease, I(t) , is measured (see Methods). The results are finally averaged over different initial conditions and network realizations. Fig. 3 shows the fraction of infected individuals as a function of \u03bb/\u03bb * c for several system sizes and for the bipartite ((a) and (b)) and unipartite ((c) and (d)) graphs. In this figure, the infection probability \u03bb has been rescaled by the theoretical value \u03bb * c given by Eq. (5) . The purpose of the rescaling is twofold. First it allows to check the validity of the theoretical predictions and, at the same time, it provides a clear comparison of the results obtained for bipartite networks with those obtained for the unipartite case. Again we have used the values of \u03b3 M and \u03b3 F extracted from the lifetime number of sexual partners reported for Sweden and U.K. [21, 22, 23] . Fig. 3 indicates that the analytical solution, Eq. (5), is in good agreement with the simulation results for the two-gender model formulation. Conversely when the bipartite nature of the underlying graph is not taken into account, the epidemic threshold is underestimated, being \u03bb c /\u03bb * c smaller than 1. In addition to this, the error in the estimation grows as the population size increases, in agreement with our theoretical predictions.",

Our results show that, even in the cases when the epidemic threshold vanishes in the infinite network size limit, the epidemic incidence in finite populations is less dramatic than actually expected for unipartite scale-free networks. The results also point out that the larger the population, the greater the gap between the epidemic thresholds predicted by the two models, therefore highlighting the need to accurately take into account all the available information on how heterosexual contact networks look like. Our results also have important consequences for the design and refinement of efficient degree-based immunization strategies aimed at reducing the spread of STDs. In particular, they pose new questions on how such strategies have to be modified when the interactions are further compartmentalized by gender and only crossed infections are allowed. We finally stress that the present approach is generalizable to other models for disease spreading (e.g. the \"susceptibleinfected-removed\" model) and other processes where crossed infection in bipartite networks is the mechanism at work.",

The first stage consists of assigning the connectivity k M i (i = 1,...,N M ) to each member of the male population by generating N m random numbers with probability distribution P M k = A M k \u2212\u03b3M ( \u221e k0 A M k \u2212\u03b3M = 1, with k 0 = 3). The sum of these N m random numbers fixes the number of links N l of the network. The next step is to construct the female population by means of an iterative process. For this purpose we progressively add female indi-viduals with a randomly assigned degree following the distribution P F k = A F k \u2212\u03b3F ( \u221e k0 A F k \u2212\u03b3F = 1, with k 0 = 3). Female nodes are incorporated until the total female connectivity reaches the number of male edges, i k F i \u2264 N l . In this way one sets the total number of females N F . Once the two sets of N M males and N F females with their corresponding connectivities are constructed each one of the N l male edges is randomly linked to one of the available female edges avoiding multiple connections. Finally those few female edges that did not receive a male link in the last stage are removed and the connectedness of the resulting network is checked.",
