Alongside the IgG antibody is the IgA antibody and cytotoxic T cells directed against the SARS-CoV-2 virus. 10, 13 Immunity against reinfection is now demonstrated in a monkey model, 22 with a neutralising antibody clearly being a key component of the immune response, orchestrated by T-helper and memory cells. 2, 10, 22, 23 The value of rapid antibody testing in determining infectiousness How can we be confident that a person is not infectious? Firstly, those who have had documented COVID-19 will have had protective immune responses and cleared the virus (confirmed test results with compatible illness are convincing). Secondly, those asymptomatic patients who were in contact with an infected person will have at least short-lived immunity -weeks or months, but probably not years (needs further longitudinal research). Thirdly, those who have never been in contact with a person or objects carrying SARS-CoV-2 will be non-infectious (difficult to ascertain, but might include some very strict self-isolators).",
