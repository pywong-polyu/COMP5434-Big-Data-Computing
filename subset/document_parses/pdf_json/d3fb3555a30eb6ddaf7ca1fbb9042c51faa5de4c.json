As a result, Indigenous people have had to respond by continuously adapting traditional ways and have grieved these losses individually and communally. The ongoing conditions directly associated with settler colonialism are revealed in systematic and systemic racism and violence in the present. The global COVID-19 pandemic revealed more publically these structural inequities that are experienced by Indigenous people living in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada. In April 2020, three Indigenous people were killed by police, causing Indigenous people to adapt the ways they participate in end-of-life ceremonies. Through our communal connections, when something happens to one Indigenous person, it happens to all of us. As the community addresses these losses, they do so under the constraints of the pandemic and the systemic racism propagated through the colonial lens of the police and the news media which continues to misunderstand and critique Indigenous people's ways. This essay will explore the ways in which grieving is a communal experience for Indigenous people and how the global pandemic COVID-19 further complicates grieving for Indigenous peoples.",

Unfortunately, untimely deaths caused by police violence are all too familiar in Indigenous communities.

Because of this, when the news notifications stated that a 16-year-old girl was killed by police, I knew she was Indigenous.",

One way that Indigenous people have adapted is to gather to publically address these tragedies while simultaneously fostering support from one another as they begin to grieve communally. Adhering to social restrictions, a \"Justice for Eishia Hudson Car Vigil\" occurred on April 12, 2020, with people gathering to leave mementos, grieve communally and demand justice, which all occurred at the site where she was shot by police (Hatherly, 2020) . The local media labeled the participants as protesters (Winnipeg Police (@wpgpolice), 2020a) misunderstanding and detracting from their central message. Additionally, police blocked the intersection, citing safety precautions, essentially making the statement that traffic or other peoples' priorities needed to take precedence over communal grieving (Winnipeg Police (@wpgpolice), 2020b), whereas the news media (Hatherly, 2020 ) and a community member expressed via Twitter, that the police intervention \"actively blockaded people similarly from mourning Eisha Hudson\" (sic) (Green, 2020) . Again, Indigenous people are prevented from participation, causing further adaptation and attempting to grieve in the face of adversity.",

It is difficult to write about Indigenous spirituality because it is something that is felt, experienced, and observed. Our culture and spirituality have been written about in a way that resulted in \"mistranslation, misinterpretation, mystery and romance written about us\" (White Hat, 2012). As a result, when discussing Indigenous spirituality and ceremony in a scholarly context, the Indigenous words used to fully express this lived experience does not translate well into English or Western intellectual frameworks. White Hat (2012) asserts that while we live in a modern context, \"the spirituality, the life, is still there\", meaning that being Indigenous is both metaphysical and physical. The connection between and among Indigenous people is captured in that short sentiment -it's still there, though capturing the full dynamics of a living universe in writing remains difficult.",

White Hat offers examples to further understand a part of the intentions of practicing ceremony by asking the spirits for health and healing of a loved one. Spiritual support, the communal power of praying for and with one another is found by gathering, eating and telling stories at the ceremonies. The orientation towards others, our families, communities, the collective are central to our worldview and we ask the spirits, our relatives for help and support for what we as well as others may need help and support with when we pray.",

When someone dies, there are ceremonies to help the person's spirit to \"go on a good journeynot to look back, to have a good journey\" (White Hat, 2012: 68) . White Hat (2012) offers further insights into mourning related to Lakota people, both historical and contemporary. The periods of mourning focus on living and moving forward in a positive way. The community have a role in this process, by helping in preparation, organization, and throughout the ceremony. While some may envision a formal ceremony setting, we are often in ceremony the moment a relative dies until we can stop mourning. For the person who died, protocol instructs that their spirit has to move on to the next place in the journey, and there are a number of ways we are guided during this time; one way in particular is to not cry (White Hat, 2012) . When we cry we hold them back, because we are expressing distress and suffering, so naturally a relative is empathetic and thus they suffer, and if the outcome is a desire for your loved one to be happy, then we have to let them go (White Hat, 2012) . It should be noted that this is a traditional teaching and as Indigenous people adapt to modern contexts, we may not be able to uphold this teaching as we live very differently now than our ancestors did. As we face injustices and collect the layers of complications for the grief, we must be able to process these feelings as needed which likely involves crying. Memorial feasts mark the end of mourning, where families offer prayer and physical offerings to all of creation here and in the spirit world, with the intention of letting the spirit go (White Hat, 2012) . Additionally, many tribes share a related philosophy with similar values and purposes that underlie their ceremony and rituals.",

I was conducting research with Knowledge Holders where I was exploring aspects of loss and grief unique to Indigenous peoples. In-person research interactions were halted by the university. In keeping with traditional transmission of Indigenous knowledge, I informally spoke with my network of Knowledge Holders, Indigenous colleagues and friends about the notion of communal grief and how we move forward with healing in this altered reality of the global pandemic. Adding more complexity to this situation, the COVID-19 restrictions also prevented funerals, wakes and ceremonies as gatherings of more than 10 people were prohibited. The conversations within my network brought to light Indigenous knowledges that mirror the lessons of Albert White Hat. We discussed the wide range of rituals conducted by the living that help the spirit move on with their journey and not only practice but create meaning in community by coming together to keep a fire for four days, tend to and hold a vigil with the body, make offerings, pray, and hold ceremony as well as feed the spirit and each other. In sum, the community, through these protocols and practices, share the weight of the grief, with particular focus on helping the family. People gather to support each other through the sharing of stories, offerings of healing for those suffering through prayers and practices. For those of us who are able to follow these practices, they allow individuals to feel and process grief while working to find a way to lessen the burden of others. Collectively the grief is felt and healed individually through the community prayers and support while also ensuring that the spirit is sent on its journey so it can do what it needs to do.",

While there is great diversity within and among Indigenous peoples, practices vary widely; one commonality is to provide support to each other and to send the spirit on its journey in a positive way. The relatives left behind do our best to honour the traditions in spite of the obstacles related to the pandemic and police violence.

Further work needs to focus on dismantling settler colonial structures that propagate inequality and inferiority of Indigenous peopleone of the root causes of the disparities and racism in social systems. To do so, social workers can take an anticolonial stance (Hart, 2009 ), a social, political and cultural positioning in elevating and honouring Indigenous practices by collaborating with Indigenous peoples and centering their values, practices and needs to create systems build on localized Indigenous worldviews -much like the MSW-IK program -need to happen more often.",

Social workers can use their skills to work against these forces to assist in following both the health guidelines and Indigenous cultural practices. One method for working within and across communities includes the recognition of the collective survival strategies that communities have always used to endure, heal and rebuild from the communal losses and grief (Bell et al., 2019) . This may include gathering to grieve collectively while also fighting for justice on behalf of a loved one, as Eisha Hudson's family continues to publically organize. At these gatherings, Jason Collins and Stewart Andrews are also invoked and remembered. Hudson's family leads the community in forging paths of healing and continuing the ceremony of sending her spirit on its journey. Another strategy to support the healing for Indigenous peoples is to remember our philosophies and spiritual practices have allowed Indigenous people to endure, heal and rejuvenate as we addressed the many communal losses experienced over the last few centuries.",
