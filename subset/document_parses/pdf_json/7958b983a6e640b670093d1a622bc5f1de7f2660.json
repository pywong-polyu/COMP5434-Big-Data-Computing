Patients with chronic pain may have faced an increased burden during pandemic and the resources of this vulnerable population are unknown. Therefore, a qualitative study was conducted to understand how people with chronic pain have experienced the course of the pandemic. Patients and Methods: Twenty semi-structured telephone interviews were conducted six months after the initial lockdown in Germany. The participants were patients with chronic pain who exhibited varying changes in their pain during the first German lockdown, recruited from a German outpatient pain clinic at a Department of Anesthesiology and Intensive Care. The semi-structured interview guidelines were designed to explore how patients with chronic pain experienced their pain during the pandemic, how they coped, and how they experienced pain management during this time. The interview recordings were transcribed verbatim and coded using the qualitative content analysis method. Results: Four themes emerged from the results: differential impact on pain experience, difficulty coping with pain, supportive pain management, and endurance. Conclusion: During this uncertain time, it was particularly important to maintain pain treatment in order to establish a sense of safety and stability. This underscores the special role of maintaining therapeutic contact during a pandemic and the potentially special role of telemedicine.",

Chronic pain is often associated with psychosocial factors. 1 Therefore, it can be assumed that the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on daily life, pain treatment and mental health influenced patients' pain experience in many ways. 2, 3 Chronic pain disorders have an estimated prevalence of 17% in Germany and affects both younger and older people, the number of affected people increasing with age. 4 Furthermore, pain is the most common condition in the world and the one that limits people most severely in the long term, placing a significant burden on society and the healthcare system. 5 Pain disorders are often associated with other chronic somatic and psychological diseases. 4, 6, 7 Due to their older age and concomitant somatic diseases, many pain patients likely belong to the group at risk for severe COVID-19. 8 Therefore, it is of interest to explore the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental and physical well-being of pain patients.",

To address the psychosocial aspects of the pain condition, relaxation methods and psychotherapy are offered. Patients are also referred to self-help groups. Patients with severe courses for which outpatient treatment is not sufficient receive referrals for interdisciplinary multimodal pain therapy in an inpatient setting. Traditionally, pain treatment was provided only in direct contacts with patients as appointments in outpatient service units, telemedicine was used very rarely.

As is also evident from quantitative studies, the stress experienced by pain patients was primarily reported to be related to uncertainty of the situation, concern about not receiving pain treatment, and social isolation. [14] [15] [16] As in the study by Smyrnioti et al, the effects of the initial lockdown on social and work life were apparently more severe for pain patients than the pandemic itself. 17 While some pain patients suffered from the containment measures, the majority did not feel significantly impacted. As the pain patients interviewed here already led socially and professionally restricted lives due to their pain prior to the pandemic, the containment measures were not experienced as particularly impairing. Others described experiencing their pain condition as worse than the pandemic and therefore did not feel severely affected. Similar results were found by Amja et al 21 in their qualitative study of back pain patients in Qu\u00e9bec, observing two groups of pain patients. On the one hand, there were patients whose pain was well managed by regular pain management and social support who experienced strong changes in the pain management framework because of the COVID-19 measures. On the other hand, there were those who did not have many resources for dealing with the pain disorder and were already living more socially isolated lives prior to the pandemic, and therefore experienced little change because of the pandemic. Through the present results and those of Amja et al it is becoming clear that there are pain patients who are exposed to great distress regardless of the pandemic situation. This assumption can also be supported by earlier results of a qualitative study on the quality of life of people with chronic pain disease. 36 Others even felt that the order to stay at home relieved them physically and psychologically, as they had more time for themselves and could better adapt their day to their physical needs. In their qualitative study, Dassieu et al 22 asked pain patients across Canada how they experienced the COVID-19 pandemic and what challenges they experienced. They also found that pain patients felt relieved by the slowed daily routine during the lockdown. In addition, their pain condition had been more recognized by those around them, as healthy individuals had also experienced similar experiences as pain patients during the initial lockdown due to the restrictions. Dassieu et al clearly state that pain patients are generally overburdened by occupational and social demands in their normal daily lives without pandemic conditions, and that chronic pain disease should be given more social consideration as a disability.",

[37] [38] [39] [40] Among the pain patients interviewed in this study, the pain condition itself seems to constitute a resource that could help pain patients to survive the COVID-19 pandemic. This is because years of coping with the pain condition allowed them to develop strengths that could protect them during the pandemic. They had learned through the pain disorder to accept and adapt to negative experiences that could not be changed. 41 Many of the patients interviewed were also able to perceive positive personal developments despite the difficult situation, which can be described as personal growth in the context of crises. 42 These include an orientation toward one's own strengths and a more intensive appreciation of life and relationships. Nevertheless, a lack of resources also became apparent, especially in the case of pain amplification caused by the pandemic. To reduce their pain, patients need a high level of pain-related self-efficacy expectations, ie, a belief in their own ability to control their pain. 43 Only a few participants succeeded in reducing and containing pain through more physical activity, distraction, and exercise. The others, in line with previous studies, described their difficulties in compensating for the absence of their physical therapy by performing more exercises. 44, 45 Pain management proved to be particularly important in helping patients cope with pain during the COVID-19 pandemic.",

This regularity presumably provided the patients with security and gave them a certain stability that had been threatened by the sudden discontinuation of therapies due to the pandemic. Thus, it becomes clear that the promotion of self-management skills should be strongly addressed in pain treatment much more strongly than it currently is. Self-management is an umbrella term that encompasses all the skills a patient needs to control dysfunctional thoughts, feelings, and behaviors and to cope with problems independently. 46 Therefore, the goal of promoting selfmanagement skills in pain therapy is to enable patients to manage their pain nearly independently of external professional help. There is evidence that self-management interventions are effective in improving pain intensity and quality of life. 47, 48 Nevertheless, there is also evidence that many pain patients have inadequate self-management skills. 49 Mun et al 20 showed that the pandemic had an effect on the self-management of pain patients. That continuation of previously effective self-management strategies protects against an increase in pain during the first lockdown. It has been shown in many other studies that containment measures, in particular, led to a reduction in the performance of exercise and more rest, which is associated with more pain. 15, 16 For this reason, pain patients should be given more support by their pain practitioners in their autonomy and selfdetermination in dealing with their pain.

Pain patients are especially likely to exhibit insecure attachment behaviors, 54 which may make it more difficult for them to build trust with the physician via telemedicine.

These two methodological approaches generated valid and high-quality qualitative data.

As a result of the containment measures, the strategies acquired over the years for dealing with the pain condition were disrupted and were related to uncertainty and pain intensification. This also highlights the need for pain patients to be more empowered in their self-management of pain to be better prepared for times of crisis with pain amplification, quite independent of the pandemic. The study shows that the continuation of pain treatment during a pandemic can protect against persistent pain intensification, and telemedicine provides a good opportunity for this. The qualitative results found here offer new approaches that can be examined through further quantitative research.",
