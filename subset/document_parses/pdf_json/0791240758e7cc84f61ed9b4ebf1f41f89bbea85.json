It affects around 0.2% of the population, most commonly women aged 13 to 50 years. POTS can be debilitating; prolonged episodes of pre-syncope and fatigue can severely affect activities of daily living and health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Medical treatment is limited and not supported by randomised controlled trial (RCT) evidence. Lifestyle interventions are first-line treatment, including increased fluid and salt intake, compression tights and isometric counter-pressure manoeuvres to prevent fainting. Observational studies and small RCTs suggest exercise training may improve symptoms and HRQoL in POTS, but evidence quality is low.",

Secondary physiological, clinical and health-related outcomes including sub-maximal recumbent bike exercise test, active stand test and HRQoL will be measured at 4 and 7 months postrandomisation by researchers blinded to treatment allocation. The PostUraL tachycardia Syndrome Exercise (PULSE) intervention consists of (1) individual assessment; (2) 12-week, once to twice-weekly, supervised out-patient exercise training; (3) behavioural and motivational support; and (4) guided lifestyle physical activity. The control intervention will be best-practice usual care with a single 30-min, one-to-one practitioner appointment, and general advice on safe and effective physical activity. For the embedded qualitative study, participants (n = 10 intervention, n = 10 control) will be interviewed at baseline and 4 months post-randomisation to assess acceptability and the feasibility of progressing to a definitive trial.",

            "text": "Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) affects the autonomic nervous system resulting in an abnormal cardiovascular response to upright posture. It is defined as a clinical syndrome that is usually characterised by (1) frequent symptoms that occur with standing such as light-headedness, palpitations, tremulousness, generalised weakness, blurred vision, exercise intolerance and fatigue; (2) an increase in heart rate of \u2265 30 beats per minute when moving from a recumbent to a standing position held for more than 30 s; and (3) the absence of orthostatic hypotension (> 20 mmHg drop in systolic blood pressure) [1] . The pathophysiology of POTS is multi-factorial. Symptoms may result from a multitude of mechanisms, including but not limited to volume depletion, immune dysfunction or autoimmune disease, cardiac and physical deconditioning and the inability of lower limb vasoconstriction to compensate for postural blood volume shifts [2] . A disproportionate autonomic response, aimed at rectifying haemodynamic compromise, results in the hallmark features of prolonged pre-syncope (feeling of being about to faint) and fatigue [1, 3] . POTS can be debilitating; simple activities may result in persistent orthostatic intolerance. This can lead to poor concentration, palpitations, nausea, 'brain fog' and exercise intolerance [3] affecting activities of daily living and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) [4] . Hypermobility spectrum disorders (HSD) are a common comorbidity [5] . The ability to attend education, undertake gainful employment and care for dependants can be substantially compromised by POTS. A constellation of symptoms can initiate a negative feedback loop by which enforced inactivity further precipitates orthostatic intolerance, immobility and deconditioning [6, 7] .",

According to expert consensus, non-pharmacological therapy is first-line treatment [1] . Conservative measures include increased fluid and salt intake, compression tights, isometric counter-pressure manoeuvres (e.g. hand gripping and leg crossing/tensing) to prevent fainting, and psychological interventions to help manage chronic illness [1] . Exercise training is also advocated as an essential component of POTS treatment [1] . However, this is based on only two small studies, one of which excluded people with HSD [9] and one which investigated orthostatic intolerance in military recruits [10] . These studies demonstrated some physiological improvement (increased left ventricular mass/blood volume and decreased standing heart rate), reduced symptoms and improved HRQoL. More recently, a prospective observational study (n = 251) enrolled people with POTS on 3 months of unsupervised community exercise [8] . A total of 103 people completed the treatment, of which 73 no longer met the diagnostic criteria for POTS, and HRQoL was improved. However, the study was limited by the lack of a control group, and poor individualisation and supervision of exercise, leading to 60% attrition.",

Every second week, before or after their supervised exercise session, participants will receive a one-to-one, 30min behavioural and motivational session delivered by a trained PULSE practitioner, with the aim of improving short-and long-term adherence to exercise. The PULSE intervention will be based on a cognitive behavioural framework including self-efficacy and selfmanagement principles with behaviour change theory [19] . In particular, the COM-B model of behaviour change ('capability', 'opportunity', 'motivation' and 'behaviour') will be applied to the content and delivery of the behavioural sessions. Capability relates to increasing confidence through supervised exercise practice and exploring participants' own health beliefs and perceived barriers which may prevent them from progressing with the intervention. For example, quite often people with POTS may avoid certain activities and movement due to a fear of aggravating symptoms [20] . Opportunity, both internal and external to the individual, will be explored through beliefs and thoughts in relation to knowledge and acceptance of POTS, including principles of self-management and skills of living with what is sometimes termed 'the invisible condition'. Access to material and information covered in the sessions will be ensured by producing a participant handbook to allow consolidation of learning and reflection in between sessions. Motivation will also be key to sustained behaviour change for people with POTS. This will be addressed with planning, goal setting and exploration of expectations, with opportunity for self-reflection and discussion of progress, setbacks and overcoming obstacles [21] . This will be combined with the theory of planned behaviour [22, 23] to explore participant's perceived control, intention and motivation to adhere to the PULSE intervention.",

The Fatigue Severity Scale [28] , a validated nine-item questionnaire, will be used to assess disabling fatigue. Each item is rated on a seven-point scale, from strongly disagree to strongly agree. A total score is derived from all nine questions; a higher score indicates a greater impact of fatigue on everyday activities. Self-efficacy will be measured with the generalised self-efficacy scale [29] which is a 10-item psychometric scale designed to assess optimistic selfbeliefs to cope with a variety of difficult demands in life. A single score between 10 and 40 is generated; greater self-efficacy is represented by a higher score.",

Thus, the sample size is not based on a power calculation. Nevertheless, the aim is to estimate any possible effect of the change of heart rate from supine to 10-min stand between the two treatment arms to inform a future definitive RCT. The sample size is determined using the confidence interval approach to provide a given level of precision. From a single-arm study investigating a 3-month community exercise programme in a similar population [8] , the mean increase in heart rate from supine to 10-min stand at baseline was 46 \u00b1 17 bpm and post-intervention was 23 \u00b1 14 bpm. For the purpose of this trial, the standard deviation (SD) is assumed to be the same for both treatment arms, and the SD of the difference of the change is 17 bpm. Therefore, the total sample size required to obtain a 95% confidence interval width of 20 bpm is 46 participants [30] . Assuming a drop-out rate of 25%, the total sample size required is 62 participants (31 per treatment arm). Participants will be randomised equally to the intervention or usual care arms (i.e. 1:1 ratio).",
