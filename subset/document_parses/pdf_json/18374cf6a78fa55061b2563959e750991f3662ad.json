Indeed, their work and several others have reported the detection SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the feces of COVID-19 patients, which had suggested the possibility of SARS-CoV-2 transmission via the fecal-oral route. Clinical spectrum of the disease can be very heterogeneous (Guan et al., 2020) , and rapid and accurate diagnosis is essential for, early reporting, early quarantine, early treatment, and cutting off epidemic transmission. Gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea, abdominal pain, and vomiting have been reported in patients with COVID-19, and have been correlated with SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection in stool samples of these patients (Cheung et al., 2020) .
