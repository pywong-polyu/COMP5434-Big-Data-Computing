By comparing the search volume index (SVI), a geographical difference can be determined, making funding allocation much easier [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] . Furthermore, the language used for Google search can be assessed using the GT. This is especially important in a multi-racial, multi-lingual country like Malaysia. Despite GT is being utilised throughout the medical field, thus far there is no GT analysis that investigates the language difference in Google search of common medical problems in Malaysia. We aim to conduct a cross-section observational study to determine the public interest in common medical problems in Malaysia and the language difference in Google search of these medical problems over a 10-year period.",

Paired keywords in both English and Malay languages were proposed to the expert team after going through forward and backward translations. Only keywords that had achieved an item-level content validity index (I-CVI) of 1.00 were included in the subsequent analysis using GT [16] . A total of 15 pairs of keywords attained I-CVI of 1.00 from 1st of January 2011 to 31st of December 2020 and they were analysed using GT. The year 2011 was chosen as this was the time when more than 80% of users started using Google search rather than other search engines such as Yahoo and Bing [17] . The methodology is summarized in Figure 1 . In the second part, we applied GT's customizable geographic and temporal filters to include results for searches within Malaysia from 1st of January 2011 to 31st of December 2020. After the selected search terms were entered into the GT system, GT would summarize outputs that described the frequency of searches for a given search term relative to the maximum popularity within the selected time [10] . This was called the search volume index (SVI) and it reflected the popularity of a specific search term in relation to the total volume of search queries for that specific geographical location and time [12] . The monthly SVI score ranged from 0 to 100, whereby a score of 0 reflected no search for that specific term in that month and a score of 100 represented the highest monthly search for that specific term during the study period [10, 12] . In order to evaluate the trend of Google searches in Malaysia, we had extracted the monthly SVI score for each of the selected keyword. The extracted scores were tabulated and inserted into SPSS version 21.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY) and the mean score for the first five years (from January 2011 to December 2015) was compared with the mean score for the subsequent five years (from January 2016 to December 2020) by using paired ttest. Next, we investigated the Google search difference between English and Malay languages for all the selected keywords. Paired keywords were entered into the GT as shown in Figure 2 . The geographical influence on the language used was assessed by tabulating geographical scores of all 15 paired keywords ( Figure 3 ) and an analysis using paired t-test was performed. ",

In this study, we have captured the increasing popularity of Google search as a tool to obtain information on common medical problems in Malaysia. The heavy GT traffic in the second half of the decade reflects the willingness of the Malaysian population to use Google search. The surge of GT traffic is demonstrated in both English and Malay keywords across Malaysia. Likewise, Google searches have increased in all keywords across different disciplines in medicine, be it medical-based or surgical-based. This upward trend is consistent with other studies in the literature [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] . For example, Lim et al. reportedly used GT to track Malaysian public information-seeking behavior while Mohamad and Kok used GT to track public interest in breast cancer screening in Malaysia [14, 15] .",

With Malay ethnicity as the major population and Malay language being the national language in Malaysia, it is unsurprising that the majority of the states use Malay keywords more frequently than English keywords. The difference is more pronounced in the East Coast of Malaysia with Terengganu, Kelantan and Pahang occupying the top three of the chart in terms of Malay language usage. On the other hand, only Penang state exhibits statistically significant English usage compared to the Malay language. The presence of various missionary schools, international schools, colleges, and universities may have contributed to the language used in this state.",

Nevertheless, this list is not exhaustive and may not be representative for niche area such as rare diseases. Similarly, the language predominance may be affected by the use of different keywords. Nonetheless, this is the first study that shows a geographical influence on the language used in Google search. Besides that, there are different keywords which may have multiple synonyms and translations. For example, SVI for keywords such as \"cancer\", \"malignancy\" and \"tumour\" that describe a similar disease may be different. In the same vein, keywords such as \"kanser\", \"barah\", and \"ketumbuhan\" may be similar in Malay language and they may affect the keyword SVI. However, we try to limit the discrepancy by performing forward and backward translations for the keywords prior to vetting by the expert panel. Lastly, the upward trend of GT may be partially explained by the increasing number of Malaysians who have access to the internet throughout the study period.",
