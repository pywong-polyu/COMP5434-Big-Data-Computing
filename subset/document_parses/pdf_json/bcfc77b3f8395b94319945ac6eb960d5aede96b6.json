Instead it tries to conceptualize radical sustainable alternatives to the energy conundrum based on an emerging mode of production and a commons-based political economy. Too often energy research is removed from the social sciences and thus becomes limited within the technical boundaries of the field [3] . Sovacool et al. [4] point out how many published studies fail to address novel and interesting research questions as well as to apply rigorous research methods. We wish to build on the former point and suggest that for truly impactful energy research now, it is imperative to examine solutions that challenge the very foundation of modern organisational and production systems. We explore a type of institutional innovation, which is \"important in the light of climate change as a commons problem\" [5] . The aim is to contribute to a rhetoric and a sociotechnical imaginary of energy transitions [6] .",

One cannot do away with these aspects without changing the system itself [10, 11] . Applied to the energy systems conundrum, it is easy to see how these systemic imperatives prove to be massive roadblocks for meaningful progress. The dependence on fossil fuels has not decreased substantially for a number of reasons. We argue that it is not a matter of technological infrastructure or even available resources. But it is due to economic and political reasons that the transition to other sources of energy has been slow, with massive energy conglomerates protecting their interests by preventing policy which would benefit alternatives as well as the potential incompatibility of renewable energy and profitable investments [12] [13] [14] . Though undoubtedly spatial, resource and energy demand as well as consumption considerations also come into play [15, 16] .

For manufacturing, the design and all relevant information of creating and using the product are made available.

The economic aspects of implementing community microgrids and interconnected microgrids, i.e., how the members of a community can cooperate and share the resulting benefits fairly among themselves, have been discussed by another author of this paper [42] . It remains challenging to practically implement the Energy Internet solutions because of hurdles often stemming from regulatory barriers in capitalist market structures, non-participation from network operators, or community acceptance itself [42] . These hurdles mean that the research on developing these solutions into a commons-oriented paradigm is still at a nascent stage. This is compounded by the fact that the co-operative P2P sharing aspect threatens existing market structures.

The resources invested in such subsidies could be redirected into enabling civilians to produce energy as well the creation of structures to support the model like local and national governance associations, while providing support for the social groups that are adversely affected by the shift. The state, which supports current energy models with subsidies, could fund the infrastructure costs via energy commons as \"green energy\" programs, in a similar way to how taxation seeks to distribute public goods equally. Our proposal to shift such subsidies towards those costs may be a basic preliminary proposal yet an arguably good place to start researching towards this line of inquiry.

For the feasibility of such alternatives, bold and radically rethink is needed on how to produce and consume energy. And we also need to reconceptualize the modern way of living, hence the importance of coupling energy proposals with wider systemic change away from a paradigm of constant growth. At this point in time, given the severity of our situation, these solutions should not be considered utopian dreams but realistic, if not necessary objectives.",
