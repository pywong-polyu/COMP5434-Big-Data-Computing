            "text": "Objective: The study sought to understand the potential roles of a future artificial intelligence (AI) documentation assistant in primary care consultations and to identify implications for doctors, patients, healthcare system, and technology design from the perspective of general practitioners. Materials and Methods: Co-design workshops with general practitioners were conducted. The workshops focused on (1) understanding the current consultation context and identifying existing problems, (2) ideating future solutions to these problems, and (3) discussing future roles for AI in primary care. The workshop activities included affinity diagramming, brainwriting, and video prototyping methods. The workshops were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. Inductive thematic analysis of the transcripts of conversations was performed. Results: Two researchers facilitated 3 co-design workshops with 16 general practitioners. Three main themes emerged: professional autonomy, human-AI collaboration, and new models of care. Major implications identified within these themes included (1) concerns with medico-legal aspects arising from constant recording and accessibility of full consultation records, (2) future consultations taking place out of the exam rooms in a distributed system involving empowered patients, (3) human conversation and empathy remaining the core tasks of doctors in any future AI-enabled consultations, and (4) questioning the current focus of AI initiatives on improved efficiency as opposed to patient care. Conclusions: AI documentation assistants will likely to be integral to the future primary care consultations. However, these technologies will still need to be supervised by a human until strong evidence for reliable autonomous performance is available. Therefore, different human-AI collaboration models will need to be designed and evaluated to ensure patient safety, quality of care, doctor safety, and doctor autonomy.",

            "text": "There has been a rapid advancement in artificial intelligence (AI) over the last decade. 1,2 AI technologies, in particular the ones employing machine learning methods, are being increasingly integrated into many healthcare domains to support consumers, their carers, and health professionals. [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] The main motivations behind employing AI technologies include supporting better decision making, improving care quality, and the need to move to precision medicine. 8 Although AI technologies have delivered promising outcomes in some cases, [9] [10] [11] there are also some serious concerns about the accuracy, bias, and patient safety of AI technologies and their unintended consequences such as deskilling. [12] [13] [14] [15] AI technologies replacing doctors 16 is an unlikely scenario, at least in the near future. 6 A more plausible alternative is the increasing advent of doctor-AI collaborations in which humans would stay in the decision-making role and some tasks would be delegated to AI. 6 So far, the performance of AI varies depending on the tasks to be delegated. It can be better than human performance (ie, drug-drug interactions), equal to humans (ie, certain radiology cases), or still require clinician supervision (eg, electrocardiography reading). 17 Primary care has become one key application field for AI development efforts. [18] [19] [20] In addition to using AI to support decision making, predictive modelling, and business analytics, 20 there is increasing interest in employing AI to assist with the documentation task in primary care. 21 This is driven by the need to reduce documentation burden, 22 which can cause clinician burnout, increase cognitive load, and lead to information loss. [23] [24] [25] AI documentation assistants (or digital scribes) are a new class of technology with the potential to move from simple record dictation to intelligent summarisation of clinical conversations enabled by the advancements in AI, machine learning, and natural language processing. 26 Primary care, with its office-based setting typically involving 2-person interactions, provides more suitable conditions for the initial development of AI documentation assistants compared with other healthcare settings, such as hospitals with their noisy environments involving many people.",

Most of the GPs agreed that future AI systems would lack empathy, and that this was likely to stay a core task for doctors. In contrast, one GP maintained that there would be room for AI systems to actually assist when doctors are struggling to be empathetic (Box 2, quote 8 Doctors' concern about AI \u2022 Quote 9: . . . A lot of the input data coming so far is from white males-so a lot of the algorithms and all of the learning at the moment is largely based on white male thinking . Doctors' concerns about AI GPs voiced several concerns, including some potential biases in patient data and system design, the time needed to fix the errors and train the system, challenges of dealing with complex cases, and the auditing of AI. One major concern was the biases that can be introduced through the data used to train a machine learning system, and subjective views on what a diagnosis means (Box 2, quote 9). Some concerns of GPs about the biases were associated with the potential medico-legal consequences (Box 2, quote 10). GPs were also concerned with the amount of training they personally might need to invest to ensure the proper functioning of such future systems. GPs felt that an AI system is likely to make many errors, and if GPs are going to spend too much time on editing and correcting the mistakes, then the benefits of having an AI assistant are diminished (Box 2, quote 11). The remaining concerns included the potential limitation of the capabilities of AI system to deal with more complex cases, the potential for AI systems to act as an auditing tool, constantly assessing the quality and performance of GPs' work, and the security of patient data, especially with a system that records everything in doctor-patient conversations similar to the one depicted in the video (Box 2, quotes 12-14). Finally, there was a concern about a future scenario in which GPs are no longer needed and have been fully replaced by an AI system (Box 2, quote 15).",

            "text": "Autonomy of GPs, central to their professional identity, 37, 38 emerged as a major theme in the discussions about a future AIenabled primary care. This theme was closely associated with doctor-AI collaboration models in which 3 roles of AI appeared: assistant, auditor, and supervisor. While AI as an assistant was seen to mostly help with documentation tasks and supporting clinical decision making, AI as a supervisor would perform many more clinical tasks and make decisions on behalf of GPs. Participants believed that although the doctors would remain the ultimate decision makers, that role is likely to be delegated to the AI systems, because doctors might be too worried about the consequences of not agreeing with a high-performing AI system, and may not feel comfortable with changing the information generated by the system. Automation bias 39 is a well-known situation in which humans may overtrust systems typically after a period of successful performance demonstrated by the system. 40 Professional autonomy of GPs can be further diminished by highly automated systems. High levels of automation and regulation may reduce doctors' role to \"pushing buttons to answer questions in an evidence based computerized diagnostic pathway.\" 38, 41 GPs' concerns were also connected with the AI's third role as an auditor. GPs imagined that future systems would constantly review their records that contain almost every detail of their interaction with patients and that this may radically transform the ways in which they provide care to their patients. GPs were also worried that an AI system could make mistakes because of the system's inability to capture some contextual information such as patients' nonverbal gestures. The limitations of AI with contextual information in healthcare settings have been highlighted previously. 12 Therefore, it would be very important for AI systems to provide some mechanisms to address this limitation and allow doctors to exercise more autonomy against AI's recommendations. In addition to patient safety, doctor safety in an AI-enabled primary care needs to be carefully considered, with special attention to its medico-legal aspects, as those concerns can have negative effects on their practice. 42 Different human-AI collaboration models need to be investigated There were contrasting views on the nature of doctor-AI collaboration. On the one hand, GPs have been increasingly relying on decision support features of their electronic health records, making such systems an indispensable part of their practice to ensure patient safety. The analogy of autopilot systems and human pilots made by the participants suggested that, similar to the human pilots who are, in most cases, no longer be able to fly when the autopilot is unavailable, doctors without any AI assistance may not be allowed to provide care to their patients in the future. On the other hand, fully autonomous AI systems in medicine seem a long way off and may not be viable because of the risks involved. 6 It has been claimed that some tasks in medicine may never go beyond level 3 autonomy, \"a conditional automation, for which humans will indeed be required for oversight of algorithmic interpretation of images and data.\" 6 Furthermore, accurate diagnosis is only a part of a patient's care: human communication is needed for different patient cases and sensitive situations. [43] [44] [45] Therefore, different models of doctor-AI collaboration need to be designed and investigated in a more participatory way. 18 Although there seems a clear path to an increased level of automation in primary care, 21 the ways in which doctors and AI work together in different scenarios with different levels of automation need to be further investigated.",

In fact, virtual consultations have been already taking place through emerging solutions using mobile applications and video streaming tools, 47 demonstrating positive outcomes including convenience and decreased cost. 48 Virtual consultations can become extremely valuable in response to disaster situations such as an infectious disease outbreak. 49 An increasing number of telehealth services can be expected in the coming years. However, their increased adoption requires establishing necessary data infrastructures 50 and new payment models. 51 One major model of care commonly recommended by the participants involved preconsultation activities in which, in addition to supporting information gathering, an AI system could analyze the information and generate a summary of the patient's reasons for visiting, with a preliminary assessment. It is possible to combine the preconsultation stage with a complete telehealth service 52 ; however, its effectiveness needs to be thoroughly investigated. 15 Aligned with the preconsultation activities, another model of care was associated with the idea of empowered patients 53 equipped with smartphone and desktop applications to monitor and manage their health. 54 These applications can be useful for early detection and prevention of various diseases as well as management of chronic conditions. 55 The new models of care suggested by participants are aligned with Bodenheimer et al's 56 Quadruple Aim, which considers healthcare professionals' well-being as a central goal in addition to the Triple Aim Model's goals of improving patient experience, improving population health, and reducing associated costs. 57 While a speechbased AI assistant in the examination room can reduce the documentation burden by automatically extracting medical information from doctor-patient conversations, 21 patient-centered solutions such as mobile health apps and automated triaging tools can improve patient experience and reduce the load on the healthcare system.",

Therefore, the views, perceptions, and concerns identified in our study may not be representative of the larger community of GPs around the world. In addition, other stakeholders receiving or providing primary care such as patients, carers, and other healthcare professionals should be involved in future research to obtain a more balanced and complete understanding of the roles that AI technologies can play in future primary care practice.",

Illustrative quotations regarding professional autonomy Individual ways to provide care \u2022 Quote 1: Because increasingly the technology means you can do a lot of things without the patient actually being in front of you. That is confronting to the traditional model . . . The [healthcare] system doesn't allow that . . . you've got to be face-to-face with the patient. [P1] \u2022 Quote 2: If they [patients] think that we're just getting suggestions from a computer, then maybe they can just get suggestions from a computer. I think it becomes more difficult to convince them that our recommendations are more valuable than what they can pick up on the internet. [P5] We need to develop machine learning that has the capability . . . to accommodate professional preferences and styles . . . It's adaptive and it supports you based on your particular consultation and decision-making processes. [P2] There'd be an audit trail around the system. You remove something you didn't think was important . . . but it may have actually been important. This way it's your judgement and your skills as to what you put in the record. P3: You're destroying social contract with this [AI assistant] P2: Why not just record the whole thing and just be done with it, and never alter it. Quote 7: You could imagine a nightmare scenario where something bad happens . . . they subpoena the records or something, and you've got years of consultation. These consultations are stored in your records, and they run search terms. A person maybe had a cancer or something, so they run through 20 symptoms of their cancer through the whole thing, and then identify every instance that was mentioned . . . and they say, \"all of these were mentioned-how come you missed it?\" Or something like that . . . I mean, in a nutshell . . . patient safety is good-it's prime, but the doctor's safety should be there [too]. [P11] Box 2. Illustrative quotations regarding human-AI collaboration Core tasks of doctors \u2022 Quote 1: Because the machine's doing all the flying so the pilot's there just to make sure everything is okay. . . . Ultimately, the human is there to make sure that if there is a discrepancy that your experience comes in. [P1] \u2022 Quote 2: P11: These days a lot of airplane travel is on autopilot that's done by computers, based on our inputs and everything else, but at the same time, would anyone here get into a flight that's entirely pilotless? P12: It's probably more dangerous if the pilots are actually flying. Quote 3: I think the point of the doctor is to give suffering meaning. It's to provide a steady hand, I think. It's to support people through issues . . . a computer can support you, but it doesn't have any meaning because there's no emotional risk from the computer because the computer does not know what it means to live or die. [P2] \u2022 Quote 4: The patient comes in but then you're asking how their husband is who's never been in to see you but doesn't want to, but you then try to help their health care as part of that consultation. I mean this [the AI assistant in the video] has no way of . . . it's that caring bit . . . because you see the body language, so sometimes it's not what they say, it's something you pick up . . . the computer won't be able to pick that up. [P7] Wouldn't it be amazing if the AI could capture all that advanced care directives and all [the] irrelevant stuff. You want to take away mundane repetitive tasks. [P1] \u2022 Quote 7: I think eventually the doctors will be the assistant doctors . . . Doctors will assist artificial intelligence what to do . . . eventually . . . we'll be helping it. I think we'll be assistant . . . Because they'll be doing everything. It will be just saying, yes, no, yes, no. Say supervision, but we'll be assisting. [P12] \u2022 Quote 8: P5: Some people are not great at doing mental health consults . . . there are some people that are terrible and for those people just the right words . . . P7: Can you imagine [if] the computer gives a suggested empathetic statement and you read it out-\"oh, that must be really difficult what you're going through\" P5: Yeah, that's probably better than what they're already doing.",

[P12] \u2022 Quote 11: If I actually spend 10 minutes with a patient, right, in an ideal world this [the AI assistant in the video] will compute everything . . . We have what the patient needs, so I'm quickly looking, yeah, that's about right, yeah, save. That's it. That's an ideal outcome. In reality, what will happen is, no, no, no, delete, delete, delete. [P6] \u2022 Quote 12: I think undifferentiated illness would be tricky with this . . . You know if the patient that comes in-\"oh, I'm just feeling a bit tired or my appetite is not great\"-very undifferentiated things . . . I mean something that's very . . . protocol driven . . . It would be very easy to do with this system [the AI assistant in the video], but I would imagine it would be much harder with a patient that comes in with kind of vague things which often we see as GPs. [P5] \u2022 Quote 13: Sometimes . . . patients will say . . . a jumble of things. Part of our job's to pick up the significant things, but in this sort of system [the AI assistant in the video] everything is picked up, and something might seem irrelevant at the time, but then six months later it's like, oh, that was actually a huge thing. [P9] \u2022 Quote 14: It's always the problem of hacking, and somebody can know what exactly you do and can track the patient record. [P7] \u2022 Quote 15: I think eventually it [AI] will take all the jobs. We're going to be the last group anyway to use this. [P11] Desired technological features of AI \u2022 Quote 16: The machine start[s] to learn your behaviors and is more predictive to your style . . . [the machine] that you're using is more nuanced to your individual style. [P6] \u2022 Quote 17: You just tell the computer what [you] want to check and then the computer will do the job and generate the report. [P14] \u2022 Quote 18: If there was a Tom's visit summary, so I could print off a document saying, Tom, you've come in with cough . . . Here's what I think's going on. Here's the management plan and here [are] the things to look out for and come back and see me . . . if one of these happen. [P7] \u2022 Quote 19: One of the advantages of when you write it is it reinforces what you thought . . . It's a thinking process, because you actually think about what this actually means? . . .
