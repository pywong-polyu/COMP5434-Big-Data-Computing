Vaccinated individuals in the population have immunity from their vaccination and are thus protected from infection (direct VE). Unvaccinated individuals, who are not immune, receive indirect protection, primarily through reduction of the number of infectious individuals at the population level. The indirect effect is, therefore, distinct from the direct effect of the vaccine. The total effect of a vaccine represents the combination of direct and indirect effects [7] .",

A cluster randomized trial in Hutterite communities in Canada [9] showed substantial indirect effects of inactivated influenza vaccines, surprisingly nearly as high as direct effects when 80% of children were vaccinated [9, 10] .

This protection has been demonstrated previously, but our findings include mild and moderate illnesses often missed by studies of medically-attended acute respiratory illness (MAARI). This was a result of our use of active surveillance and broad case definition and was particularly of interest for type B infections, which are more difficult to study with the MAARI design. With the exception of most recent seasons, influenza B has typically circulated following an initial influenza A season and often lasts into the spring months, requiring longer duration of annual surveillance to measure. Type B influenza also is more likely to produce illnesses requiring medical attention in children than in younger adults [18] , limiting the ability to identify the range of protection. In this study, direct influenza VE was highest for influenza B and for A/H1N1. The low estimates for A/H3N2 reflect global patterns in vaccine effectiveness during this time period and are particularly driven by the 2014-2015 season, when incidence was high, vaccine strain (A/Texas/50/2012) was considered a mismatch with predominant circulating viruses (genetic group 3c.2a), and vaccine effectiveness was near zero [15, 19, 20] .",

Indirect protection of unvaccinated people that live in a highly-vaccinated household was not evident. We were able to demonstrate a total effect of vaccine household vaccine coverage that was larger than the direct VE in low and moderate vaccine coverage households. Interestingly, we observed a trend of lower total VE point estimates with increasing household coverage. In fully vaccinated households, for example, total VE (33%) was similar in magnitude to the direct VE (30%), which may suggest that protection in these households is primarily driven by the direct vaccine effects rather than a combination of direct and indirect effects. It is also possible that individuals in fully vaccinated households are more health-conscious and are more likely to report illnesses meeting our case definition and are thus more likely to have influenza detected.",

Previous individual-based studies have demonstrated indirect effects of influenza vaccine, in some cases as large as the direct VE [9, 10] . In these studies, the magnitude of the indirect effects has varied based on the predominant circulating viruses. Thus, we explored indirect protection by influenza subtype (Table S3 ). In particular, we expected lower indirect protection against influenza A/H3N2 viruses for the same reason that we expected lower direct VE.
