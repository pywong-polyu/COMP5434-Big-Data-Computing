While CRS affects 4-12% population worldwide, the clinical treatments for CRS are still limited and often give rise to unsatisfactory outcomes when nasal polyps are concurrent. 1 CRS with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) is heterogeneous and can be generally classified into eosinophilic and non-eosinophilic endotypes based on the immune signatures. Eosinophilic CRSwNP characterized by extensive eosinophils infiltration and type 2 inflammation accounts for 80% of CRSwNP cases in white patients and has been extensively studied. 2, 3 However, the non-eosinophilic CRSwNP associated with Th1/Th17 activation is more prevalent in Asian countries including China and Korea, but has been less studied. 4 Recently, enhanced neutrophil infiltration was reported in both non-eosinophilic CRSwNP and eosinophilic CRSwNP with severe type 2 inflammation. 5, 6 Importantly, neutrophils may contribute to disease severity by disrupting the epithelial barrier or inducing tissue remodeling through oncostatin M or TGF-\u03b22, respectively. 7 Indeed, patients with higher neutrophil infiltration were reported to be more resistant to oral corticosteroid therapy. 8 However, the precise mechanisms underlying the regulation of neutrophilic inflammation in CRSwNP remain largely unknown.",

            "text": "Programmed cell death, which comprises apoptosis, necroptosis, pyroptosis and NETosis, plays important roles in tissue homeostasis and inflammation. 9 Apoptosis is the best-known programmed cell death executed by caspase-3,7 upon the activation of upstream initiator caspases caspase-8/9/10. 10 Necroptosis is executed by RIPK3 kinase-mediated MLKL phosphorylation and oligomerization. 11 Pyroptosis is generally induced by inflammasome-dependent-and caspase-1/11-mediated cleavage of gasdermin D and contributes to the release of cytokines IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18. 12 NETosis is a specialized lytic cell death of neutrophils and is accompanied by the release of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) to trap and kill microbes. 13 While apoptosis is historically considered as a homeostatic non-inflammatory cell death, necroptosis, pyroptosis and NETosis are highly inflammatory lytic cell death. 9, 14 Unlike pyroptosis and NETosis, necroptosis can take place in a broad range of tissues and cell types, and thus has been implicated in a broad range of physiological and pathological settings. 15 A number of inflammatory cytokines like TNF and IFNs can initiate the activation of RIPK3 especially when Caspase-8 or FADD is inactivated. Besides, pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and live pathogens such as influenza virus, Candida albicans and Staphylococcus aureus can also cause necroptosis through different mechanisms. [16] [17] [18] [19] Not surprisingly, necroptosis is implicated in the pathogenesis of multiple inflammatory diseases, such as inflammatory bowel diseases, dermatitis and hepatitis. 15, 20, 21 In these settings, necroptosis can promote inflammation through at least two distinct mechanisms. First, the necroptosis of epithelial cells may impair the barrier function and cause microflora to penetrate the intestine or skin to activate immune cells in these tissues. [20] [21] [22] Second, necroptotic cells often release proinflammatory cytokines and DAMPs including IL-1\u03b1, ATP and HMGB1, which act as second messengers to alert or activate the immune system. 23, 24 Therefore, necroptosis and inflammation can form a vicious loop to drive disease progression.",

For instance, the proinflammatory cytokine IFN-\u03b3 was reported to be involved in epithelial apoptosis in CRSwNP. 25, 26 In neutrophilic CRSwNP, our group identified that the antimicrobial peptide LL-37 was able to elicit NETosis, which may in turn exacerbate neutrophilic inflammation. 27 However, whether other types of cell death like necroptosis and pyroptosis are involved in CRSwNP pathogenesis requires further investigation. In this study, we uncovered that necroptosis was mainly responsible for the overt cell death in CRSwNP. Moreover, our data demonstrated that TNF\u03b1/IFN-\u03b3 were the culprits for necroptosis. Overall, this study links necroptosis to Th17 inflammation and neutrophil recruitment, thus providing new insight into the pathogenesis of CRSwNP. [-2019097-1] ).

By TUNEL staining, only scarcely scattered TUNEL-positive cells were observed in the non-CRSwNP control nasal mucosa, whereas pronounced TUNEL-positive cells were detected in both eosinophilic and non-eosinophilic CRSwNP group ( Figure 1A ). In line with previous report, 26 epithelial cell death was evident in the CRSwNP group, likely contributing to impaired barrier function. Of note, cell death was more pronounced in the subepithelial area of nasal polyps, suggesting the presence of immune cell death ( Figure 1A ). As TUNEL-positive cells might comprise both apoptotic and necrotic cells, we further used specific markers to define what type of cell death is involved. Immunoblotting revealed no significant difference in the apoptosis marker cleaved caspase-3 (C-Casp3) or pyroptosis marker cleaved gasdermin D (C-GSDMD) between the control and CRSwNP groups ( Figure 1B and C) . However, the phosphorylation of RIPK3 and MLKL, both of which are specific markers for necroptosis, was significantly increased in the CRSwNP group ( Figure 1B and C). IHC staining also revealed unaltered apoptosis between the control and CRSwNP groups, albeit pyroptosis was slightly increased in the non-eosinophilic group compared to the control group ( Figure 1D ). Consistent with the immunoblotting data, p-MLKL staining was markedly enhanced in nasal polyps compared to the control tissues. Of note, MLKL and p-MLKL positive cells were mainly located in the sub-epithelium area ( Figures 1D and S1A) , and the non-eosinophilic group exhibited more necroptosis than the eosinophilic group ( Figure 1D ). Thus, necroptosis rather than apoptosis or pyroptosis was specifically activated in the CRSwNP tissue.",

To test whether the increased necroptosis in CRSwNP may lead to DAMPs release, we measured IL-1\u03b1 and HMGB1 in tissue homogenates by ELISA. The IL-1\u03b1 and HMGB1 protein levels were remarkably increased in CRSwNP tissues compared to the controls, especially in the non-eosinophilic nasal polyps (Figure 2A ). Proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines including IL-8, CXCL1, IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6 were also highly expressed in the non-eosinophilic nasal polyps ( Figures 2B and S1B) . Importantly, the extent of necroptosis was positively correlated with the protein levels of IL-1\u03b1, HMGB1, IL-8 and CXCL1 (Figure 2C) , implying a possible role of necroptosis in DAMPs release and tissue inflammation. As IL-8 and CXCL1 are important chemokines for neutrophil recruitment, we reasoned that necroptosis might affect neutrophil infiltration in CRSwNP. So, we detected eosinophil and neutrophil cell numbers in the nasal mucosa by IHC staining. Similar to a previous report, 6 we found more extensive eosinophil infiltration in the eosinophilic CRSwNP than non-eosinophilic CRSwNP as evidenced by Eosinophil Cationic Protein (ECP) staining ( Figure 2D ). However, neutrophil infiltration was more pronounced in the non-eosinophilic group than in the eosinophilic group as shown by Myeloperoxidase (MPO) and Neutrophil Elastase (NE) staining ( Figure 2D ). Correspondingly, neutrophil but not eosinophil infiltration was also positively correlated with necroptosis ( Figure 2E ). Collectively, these results suggest necroptosis may promote the expression and release of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines and entailed neutrophil infiltration in CRSwNP.",

            "text": "The data presented above imply a possible link between necroptosis and neutrophilic inflammation in CRSwNP, we then explored the underlying mechanisms. It's generally believed DAMPs released by necrotic cells are potent triggers for inflammatory response through engaging pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). For example, IL-1\u03b1 and HMGB1 can initiate NF-\u03baB signaling through IL-1R and TLR-4 signaling respectively, while ATP can trigger NLRP3 inflammasome activation. 23 As IL-1\u03b1 and HMGB1 expressions were increased in CRSwNP, we hypothesized that necroptosis may promote inflammation through DAMPs. To test this notion, we treated primary nasal polyp cells with DAMPs including IL-1\u03b1, ATP, HMGB1 and checked their effects on inflammatory cytokines expression. As shown in Figure 3A DovePress development and activation like IL-1\u03b2, IL-6 and IL-23 also showed a significant elevation after IL-1\u03b1 and ATP treatment ( Figure 3B ). Similar to IL-1\u03b1 and ATP, HMGB1 also induced the expression of these inflammatory genes but to a lesser extent ( Figure 3A and B) . In contrast, cytokines produced by T helper cells like IFN-\u03b3, IL-4, IL-13 and IL-17A were not affected by DAMPs stimulation ( Figure S1C ). Both the DNPCs from eosinophilic and non-eosinophilic CRSwNP showed a similar response to stimulation with DAMPs ( Figure 3A and B) , thus DAMPs may promote inflammation in both groups. In line with the effects of DAMPs on inflammatory genes expression, we found IL-1\u03b1 protein levels were positively correlated with IL-8 and CXCL1 protein levels in CRSwNP tissues ( Figure 3C ). Therefore, we established an interesting link between DAMPs release and inflammatory cytokines and chemokines expression in CRSwNP.",

We further dissected which immune cell type underwent necroptosis in CRSwNP tissues by immunofluorescence (IF) staining of p-MLKL along with specific immune cell markers. As presented in Figure 4A and B, macrophages (CD68 + ) accounted for about 70% of the total numbers of p-MLKL positive cells detected in the nasal submucosal area, whereas only a low percentage (about 10%) of p-MLKL positive cells were neutrophils (MPO + ) or dendritic cells (CD11c + ). On the contrary, other immune cells, such as mast cells (Tryptase + ), B cells (CD20 + ) and T cells (CD3 + ) which were reported to be highly enriched in CRSwNP's nasal mucosae, 30 did not show a notable p-MLKL staining ( Figure 4A ). The percentage of p-MLKL positive cells among CD68 positive macrophages was about 25%, with no significant difference between eosinophilic and non-eosinophilic CRSwNPs ( Figure 4C ). Similar to the previous reports, 31 we found markedly increased macrophage infiltration in CRSwNP tissues compared to control tissues ( Figure 4D) . Together, these results demonstrated massive macrophage infiltration and necroptosis were associated with CRSwNP, and suggested a possible role of macrophage necroptosis in CRSwNP.",

            "text": "Next, we sought to explore the possible triggers for macrophage necroptosis in CRSwNPs. We first checked the presence of legitimate necroptosis inducers of TNF and IFN family such as TNF-\u03b1, FasL, TRAIL, IFN-\u03b2 and IFN-\u03b3 in control tissues and CRSwNPs. We found TNF\u03b1 and FasL protein levels were significantly higher in the non-eosinophilic nasal polyps compared to the eosinophilic and control tissues, whereas TRAIL expression was similar among the three groups ( Figure 5A ). IFN-\u03b3 protein levels were notably higher in both eosinophilic and non-eosinophilic CRSwNPs than in control tissues, while IFN-\u03b2 expression was elevated only in the eosinophilic nasal polyps ( Figure 5A ). Therefore, we focused on TNF-\u03b1 FasL and IFN-\u03b3 next since their expression was all increased in the non-eosinophilic CRSwNPs, which also had the highest necroptotic cell numbers ( Figure 1D ). Recently, a study reported TNF-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b3 can induce macrophage cell death accompanied by MLKL activation. 32 We then set out to test whether they could also induce cell death in the human monocyte/macrophage cell-line THP-1 cells. Though TNF-\u03b1 or IFN-\u03b3 alone failed to induce cell death, they acted together to induce pronounced cell necrosis in a timedependent manner, as indicated by the drastic decrease in intracellular ATP and potent release of extracellular LDH ( Figure 5B) . Notably, the TNF-\u03b1-and IFN-\u03b3-induced cell necrosis could not be rescued by caspase-1 inhibitor YVAD, caspase-3 inhibitor DEVD or pan-caspase inhibitor z-VAD, excluding a possible role for apoptosis or pyroptosis. However, the RIPK3 inhibitor GSK'872 and MLKL inhibitor necrosulfonamide (NSA) significantly attenuated THP-1 cell death ( Figure 5C ), suggesting an important role of RIPK3 and MLKL in TNF-\u03b1/IFN-\u03b3 induced cell necrosis. Besides, TNF-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b3 induced potent phosphorylation of RIPK3 and MLKL, hallmarks of necroptosis signaling activation ( Figure 5D ).",

Intriguingly, mTOR was greatly activated upon TNF-\u03b1 plus IFN-\u03b3 treatment as evidenced by increased phosphorylation of the mTOR substrate S6 ( Figure 5D ).

In this study, we found that necroptosis was selectively activated in CRSwNP, a phenomenon possibly triggered by the presence of proinflammatory cytokines like TNF-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3 and nasal commensal. In addition, the mTOR pathway positively regulated TNF-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b3induced necroptosis. Our data further revealed that necroptosis-associated DAMPs such as ATP and IL-1\u03b1 can boost inflammatory cytokines and chemokines expression to mediate neutrophil recruitment to the CRSwNP tissues ( Figure 6 ). Collectively, we established an interesting link between necroptosis, DAMPs release and neutrophilic inflammation in CRSwNP.",

Nevertheless, we did not observe obvious necroptosis of nasal epithelial cells in CRSwNP, which frequently takes place in IBD to cause epithelial barrier dysfunction. 22, 33 This is likely due to low expression of MLKL in nasal epithelial cells as evidenced by our IHC data. On the contrary, macrophages appear to be the major cells with prominent MLKL phosphorylation. Given the fact macrophages express a broad range of PRRs, it is conceivable that macrophage might be prone to cell death under the circumstances like inflammatory and infectious conditions. However, it is also possible that macrophages may actively take up necroptotic cells and thus exhibit strong MLKL phosphorylation. In addition to necroptosis, other types of cell death like apoptosis or NETosis were also reported in CRSwNP. While our data revealed no significant increase in apoptosis, pyroptosis was elevated in the noneosinophilic CRSwNP. In line with this phenomenon, a recent study found IL-1\u03b2 protein level was upregulated in neutrophilic CRSwNP. 35 Since pyroptosis can be mediated by other gasdermin members, 36 the role of pyroptosis in CRSwNP warrants further investigation.",

            "text": "While necroptosis can be initiated by inflammatory cytokines and pathogens in vitro, the physiological or pathological triggers for necroptosis in vivo remain undefined, especially when Caspase-8 activity is intact. Our data showed RIPK3 and MLKL protein levels were increased notably in CRSwNP, while the expression of FADD was significantly decreased, which may explain why necroptosis was actively induced in this scenario. A recent study reported TNF-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b3 can trigger a mixed type of cell death termed PANoptosis in macrophages, in which case the caspase, gasdermin and MLKL were all activated. 32 Here, we found TNF-\u03b1 plus IFN-\u03b3 can promote RIPK3 and MLKL phosphorylation in THP-1 cells. Importantly, both RIPK3 and MLKL inhibitors reduced TNF-\u03b1 plus IFN-\u03b3-induced cell death, suggesting an important role of necroptosis in this case. Of note, PAMPs also induced remarkable cell death in combination with TNF-\u03b1 or IFN-\u03b3. It is possible that both the inflammatory cytokines and the nasal commensals work together to induce macrophage necroptosis in CRSwNP. Our recent studies revealed mTOR hyperactivation sensitized cells to necroptosis by promoting RIPK3 and MLKL expression in both intestinal epithelial cells and murine macrophages, 18,33 here we uncovered a positive role of mTOR in facilitating TNF-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b3-induced cell death without affecting RIPK3 and MLKL protein abundance. However, the detailed mechanisms of how mTOR regulates this process need to be further elucidated.",

            "text": "Although CRSwNP is traditionally regarded as a Th2skewed and eosinophilic disease, recent studies 5,6 and our data showed that neutrophils were also abundantly present in both eosinophilic and non-eosinophilic CRSwNP. Neutrophils are recruited by the chemokines including CXCL1, CXCL2 and IL-8, which can be induced by PAMPs or IL-17 family members. Consistent with the previous studies, 5,6 we found IL-8 and CXCL1 protein levels were elevated in CRSwNP. Previous studies have found ATP or IL-1\u03b1 can boost Th17 differentiation through inducing inflammasome activation or IL-6 and IL-23 expression. 37, 38 In addition, extracellular ATP and IL-1R signaling can mediate neutrophils recruitment to the lung or brain by inducing neutrophil chemoattractants. 39, 40 However, it remains unclear whether necroptosis and the released DAMPs are involved in neutrophil recruitment in CRSwNP. Here, we found that ATP and IL-1\u03b1 could directly stimulate IL-8 and CXCL1 transcription in primary nasal polyp cells. Moreover, ATP and IL-1\u03b1 upregulated IL-1\u03b2, IL-6 and IL-23 expression, which may further promote Th17 differentiation and function in CRSwNP. As Th17 cells play an important role in neutrophil recruitment via producing IL-17, DAMPs may regulate neutrophil infiltration through both mechanisms. Indeed, necroptosis and IL-1\u03b1 were positively correlated with IL-8 and CXCL-1, as well as neutrophil infiltration in CRSwNP. However, the major cell types that respond to DAMPs and the relative contributions of DAMPs to proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines expression in CRSwNP still remain unclear.",
