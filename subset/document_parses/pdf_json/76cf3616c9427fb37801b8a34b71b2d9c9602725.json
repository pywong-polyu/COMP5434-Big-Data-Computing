The population is divided in 3 compartments regarding their alcohol consumption, namely Susceptible individuals S (nonconsumers), Moderated drinkers M and Risk drinkers R. The transitions among those states are rules by probabilities. Despite the simplicity of the model, we observed the occurrence of two distinct nonequilibrium phase transitions to absorbing states. One of these states is composed only by Susceptible individuals S, with no drinkers (M = R = 0). On the other hand, the other absorbing state is composed only by Risk drinkers R (S = M = 0). Between these two steady states, we have the coexistence of the three subpopulations S, M and R. Comparison with abusive alcohol consumption data for Brazil shows a good agreement between the model's results and the database.",

One interesting aspect that should be taken into consideration when modeling alcohol consumption is the tendency on some individuals to gradually increase their consumption rate, not due to social susceptibility, but when under stressful or depressing circumstances, since alcohol plays a major role both as cause and consequence of depression, for instance [16] . This means that one can attach a probability of a moderate drinker to become an excessive drinker that is dependent only on the actual moderate drinkers population size, instead of the two population groups involved in the change. If one considers the current world situation with the recent coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak (COVID-19), this self-induced increase in alcohol consumption is not only realistic, but also becomes more prominent -this has been observed in a myriad of studies this year detailing the consequences and dangers of both alcohol withdrawal (in places where it has become harder to legally acquire alcohol during the pandemic) and alcohol consumption increase [17, 18, 19, 20] .",

On the other hand, a risk drinker is a man who consumes more than 50 cc of alcohol every day or a woman who consumes more than 30 cc of alcohol every day [5] 1 . Since we are considering a contagion model, the probabilities related to changes in agents' compartments represent the possible contagions. The transitions among compartments are as following: In the above rules, \u03b2 represents an \"infection\" probability, i.e., the probability that a consumer (M or R) individual turns a nonconsumer one into drinker. The Risk drinkers R can also \"infect\" the Moderated M agents and turn them into Risk drinkers R, which occurs with probability \u03b4. These two infections occur by contagion, in our model, where individuals belonging to a group with a higher degree of consumption can influence others to drink more via social contact. This transition M \u2192 R can also occur spontaneously, with probability \u03b1, if a given agent increase his/her alcohol consumption -this is the only migration pathway from one group to another, in this model, that does not depend on the population of the receiving compartment, since it corresponds to a self-induced progression from Moderate (M) to Risk (R) drinking. As stated in the introduction, above, the increase of alcohol consumption has been documented to occur under stressful circumstances (like the COVID-19 pandemic) or clinical depression, regardless of social interaction with Risk drinkers. Finally, the probability \u03b3 represents the infection probability that turn Risk drinkers R into Susceptible agents S. In this case, it can represent the pressure of social contacts (family, friends, etc) over individuals that drink excessively. We did not take into account transitions from Risk (R) to Moderate (M), assuming that, as a rule, once an individual reaches a behavior of excessive consumption of alcohol, contact with Moderate drinkers does not imply on a tendency to lower one's consumption -meanwhile, it is assumed that contacts that do not drink at all are able to exert a higher pressure on them to quit drinking. It is not that the from Risk to Moderate transition cannot occur -it is just that for our model this probability, when comparing it with the overall picture, is negligible.",

One can start analyzing the time evolution of the three classes of individuals. We numerically integrated Eqs. (1), (2) and (3) the effects of the variation of the model's parameters. As initial conditions, we considered s(0) = 0.99, m(0) = 0.01 and r(0) = 0, and for simplicity we fixed \u03b1 = 0.03 and \u03b4 = 0.07, varying the parameters \u03b2 and \u03b3. In Fig. 1 (a) , (b) and (c) we exhibit results for fixed \u03b2 = 0.07 and typical values of \u03b3. One can see that the increase of \u03b3 causes the increase of s and the decrease of m and r. Remembering that \u03b3 models the persuasion of nonconsumers S in the social interactions with risk drinkers R, i.e., the social pressure of individuals that do not consume alcohol over their contacts (friends, relatives, etc) that consume too much alcohol. On the other hand, in Fig. 1 (d) we considered \u03b3 = 0.15 and \u03b2 = 0.07. For this case, where we have \u03b2 > \u03b3, we see that the densities evolve in time, and in the steady states we observe the survival of only the risk drinkers, i.e., for t \u2192 \u221e we have s = m = 0 and r = 1. This last result will be discussed in more details analytically in the following. As we observed in Fig. 1 , the densities s(t), m(t) and r(t) evolve in time, and after some time they stabilize. In such steady states, the time derivatives of Eqs. (1) -(3) are zero. In the t \u2192 \u221e limit, Eq. (1) gives us (\u2212\u03b2 m \u2212 \u03b2 r + \u03b3 r) s = 0, where we denoted the stationary values as s = s(t \u2192 \u221e), m = m(t \u2192 \u221e) and r = r(t \u2192 \u221e). This last equation has two solutions, one of them is s = 0 and from the other solution we can obtain a relation between r and m,",

Finally, it is important to mention the parameter \u03b1, that drives the only transition of the model that does not depend on a direct social interaction. That parameter models the spontaneous increase of alcohol consumption, and it is also responsible for the first phase transition (together with \u03b3), since we have \u03b2 (1) c = 0 for \u03b1 = 0.

From this figure we see the mentioned competition among the contagions. Indeed, if \u03b2 is sufficiently high, many nonconsumers become moderated drinkers. Such moderated drinkers will become risk drinkers (via probabilities \u03b1 and \u03b4), and in the case of small \u03b3 we will observe after a long time the disappearance of nonconsumers and moderated drinkers (region III). In the opposite case, i.e., for high \u03b3 and small \u03b2, the flux into the compartment S is intense, and in the long-time limit the other two subpopulations M and R disappears (region I). Finally, for intermediate values of \u03b2 and \u03b3 the competition among the social interactions lead to the coexistence of the three subpopulations in the stationary states (region II). It is worthwhile to mention that the sizes of regions I and II are directly dependent on probability \u03b1, while region III is always fixed due to Eq. (18) . This means that, if parameter \u03b1 is increased, region I will become gradually larger, which is an indication that the spontaneous evolution from moderate to risk drinking behavior increases the latter's absorbing state. In consequence, since probability \u03b1 represents a percentage of moderate drinkers that become risk drinkers without the need for social interaction, it is a crucial factor not only to implement the theoretical model but also to identify a possible percentage of the population that has a natural tendency to present excessive alcohol consumption behavior, regardless of their social interaction network. For Fig. 3 , for instance, this value is 3%. Larger values of \u03b1 narrow the set of parameters that can be chosen in order to realistically describe a real system.",

Data were collected from 2009 to 2019, thus in Fig. 4 the initial time t = 0 represents the fraction of abusive drinkers for 2009, t = 1 represents the fraction for 2010, and so on. Since the data is for the fraction of people that consume alcohol abusively, we plot the density of risk drinkers r(t) together with the data. In order to compare them with the model, we considered for the initial density of risk drinkers r(0) = 0.185 and numerically integrated Eqs. (1) -(3). The value 0.185 was chosen since it is the fraction of abusive drinkers for 2009 obtained from the database [26] . In addition, we rescaled the time of the simulation results to match the time of real data: such simulation time was multiplied by 0.12 for a better comparison. We find that the simulated drinking trajectories qualitatively correspond to the data. For the numerical results, we considered the parameters \u03b2 = 0.06, \u03b3 = 0.11, \u03b1 = 0.047 and \u03b4 = 0.2, which indicate that the probability of finding an individual that will spontaneously become a risk drinker in Brazil during the last decade is around 4,7%. Furthermore, looking at Eqs.

Naturally, in comparison with actual data, models should always present the three different phases, i.e. coexistence between the three different population groups, since descriptions with only nonconsumers or risk drinkers are unrealistic. This qualitative agreement with Brazil's database in the realistic spectrum of the model points to a good, albeit simplistic, modelling.",

These transitions separate the model in three regions: (I) existence of nonconsumers only; (II) coexistence of the three compartments and (III) existence of risk drinkers only. Regions I and III represent two distinct absorbing phases, since the system becomes frozen due to the existence of only one subpopulation for each case -this means that, in order to describe real populational systems, the parameters must be chosen so that the model falls in region II, since populations consisting solely of nonconsumers or risk drinkers do not represent a realistic entity. The critical points of such transitions were obtained analytically. A comparison with available data for Brazil's extreme alcohol consumption for the past decade shows a good qualitative agreement with the model, with the chosen parameters framed within its realistic boundaries. It will be important in a couple of years time to re-evaluate these results in the light of new data comprising years 2020 and 2021, in order to verify the direct effects of the COVID-19 pandemic in the Brazilian population's alcohol consumption. An hypothesis to be tested is a possible increase in parameter \u03b1 combined with a corresponding decrease in the other parameters, corresponding to social interactions.",

            "text": "The phase transitions observed in the model are active-absorbing phase transitions, and the predicted critical exponent for the order parameter is 1 (m \u223c (\u03b2\u2212\u03b2 c ) 1 ) as in the mean-field directed percolation, that is the prototype of a phase transition to an absorbing state [30, 31] . It would be interesting to estimate numerically other critical exponents of the model, as well as to simulate it in regular d-dimensional lattices (e.g. square and cubic) in order to obtain all the critical exponents. This is important to define precisely the universality class of the model, as well as its upper critical dimension. This extension is left for a future work. Furthermore, it can also be considered the inclusion of heterogeneities in the population, like agents' conviction [32] , time-dependent transition rates [33] , inflexibility [34] , etc. ",

It is important to note that these behaviors are present also for other parameter values, and what is shown here works as a pattern.Based on the results above, we plot inFig. 2the steady state values of the three densities s, m and r as functions of \u03b2.

For \u03b2 > 0.15 the system becomes frozen in the other absorbing phase, where there are only risk drinkers in the population after a long time, i.e., r = 1 and s = m = 0.
