[12] focused on three strategies, namely increasing sweetness (3% wt/wt sucrose), viscosity (1.8% wt/wt starch thickener) and fat (2% wt/wt sunflower oil and milk fat) based on previous astringency work. It was suggested that sweetness could suppress mouthdrying, viscosity could reduce interactions within the oral cavity and fat could improve lubrication; therefore, subsequently reducing mouthdrying [12] . However, the results using a trained sensory panel suggested such strategies at the levels tested had a limited effect on perceived mouthdrying [12] . In brief, increasing sweetness and fat significantly increased mouthdrying to a small extent, whilst viscosity had a small significant effect in suppressing mouthdrying in a protein-fortified milk matrix, but there was no significant reduction in the complete oral nutritional supplement (ONS) [12] . Therefore, concluding more research would be beneficial to understand better strategies to effectively mitigate mouthdrying.",

This finding was supported by two additional studies: (1) soymilks with increased sucrose reduced astringency [14] and (2) adding sucrose and vanilla flavouring suppressed mouthdrying in WPBs [7] . However, these studies were limited as they added a set amount of sugar to increase sweetness, rather than a progression to understand at what point sweetness could suppress mouthdrying.",

However, other fat sources or levels may have an effect. For example, where cream was added to skimmed milk, varying in fat content (0.2-5% wt/wt), the higher fat levels (2 or 5% wt/wt) were found to reduce perceived astringency [15] . Therefore, adding fat to WPBs could influence mouthdrying, but this is yet to be fully investigated. In addition, Engelen, Fontijn-Tekamp and van der Bilt [16] noted that increasing fat levels (by adding a topping such as butter) to solid food models could reduce the number of chews, via increased lubrication. Similarly, utilising toppings (firm cheese, cheese spread and mayonnaise) decreased dryness and firmness in bread and crackers [17] . Accordingly, adding toppings to whey protein fortified solid foods could be a potential strategy to suppress whey protein derived mouthdrying.",

This suggests whey protein powders (such as whey protein concentrate, WPC), which have undergone an additional heat treatment process during manufacturing, could influence subsequent texture perception of fortified products [19] . For example, a heat-stable WPC could lead to a creamier mouthfeel in a product compared with a standard WPC, potentially by increasing flow and reducing friction [19] [20] [21] .

SF-WPB was fortified with lactose at five different levels to represent a range from 0.4 to 12.4% w/v, based on a \u00d73.0 progression. The rationale for the lactose levels was that 0.4% w/v matches the control WPB lactose levels, 3.4% w/v is considered just below the lactose relative sweetness detection threshold [22] and 12.4% w/v provides a similar relative sweetness level (~2% w/v sucrose) to our previous work [7] .",

However, results suggest lactose was only able to significantly suppress mouthdrying at one of the higher lactose levels (9.4% w/v) and only to a minor extent. These results imply that a substantial amount of lactose is necessary to reduce mouthdrying and a plateau is reached beyond which further addition has no effect (i.e., at 12.4% w/v lactose the SF-WPB was not significantly sweeter and mouthdrying was not further reduced). This indicates a cross-modal effect related to the increase in sweetness. Sweetness suppressing mouthdrying is supported by previous work in this area [7, 13, 14] . Conversely, one study did not find mouthdrying to be reduced by increasing sweetness, this could relate to the beverage models utilised being more complex and involving multiple ingredients (milk protein concentrate, whey protein concentrate and skim milk) or the sensory method employed (sequential profiling) [12] . The proposed mechanism for sweetness suppressing mouthdrying is via a cross-modal cognitive effect rather than a physical change, as a sweetened WPB still adheres to the oral cavity [7] . In addition, the sensory profile results highlighted minimal differences between the two controls: (a) WPB (0.4% w/v lactose) and (b) SF-WPB (0.05% w/v lactose). There were no significant differences in sweetness and only slight differences in mouthdrying and aftertaste strength; this could have useful applications for the sport, health and lifestyle consumers interested in products with minimal sugar content.",

Accordingly, SF-WPBs were fortified with three different levels of fat (via double cream) and this had no significant effect on mouthdrying during consumption. However, increasing fat content had significant, but mixed effects, post consumption (aftertaste) on mouthdrying: (a) from 1.8% to 3.6% w/v fat, mouthdrying increased and (b) from 3.6% to 7.2% w/v fat, mouthdrying reduced. Furthermore, none of the SF-WPBs with added fat were significantly different in mouthdrying aftertaste compared with the control SF-WPB (0.9% w/v fat). Similarly, Withers et al. [12] also demonstrated that increasing fat (sunflower oil and milk fat at 2% wt/wt) could result in a significant, but minimal, increase in mouthdrying. However, a previous study which fortified skimmed milk with cream found that the higher fat levels (2 or 5% wt/wt) correlated with reduced astringency [15] . This suggests that the model beverage could be relevant where the different mechanisms associated with mouthdrying and astringency are potentially different [7] leading to variations in results. It is also noteworthy that fat was able to mask other negative sensory attributes (such as whey isolate and metallic notes), which could also have a positive effect on consumer acceptance. Therefore, altering the fat levels within products could be an alternative approach to improving mouthfeel of WPBs.",

            "text": "Differing WPCs (standard and heat-stable) had a minimal effect on the sensory profile, where the perception of the two protein fortified versions was very similar in contrast with the control cupcake. Interestingly, there were significant differences in physical properties resulting in the heat-stable cupcake (HS-WPC) having lower hardness, chewiness and cohesiveness compared with the WPC cupcake. This resulted in a potentially more favourable texture compared with the WPC cupcake; however, these differences had limited effect on the sensory profile. Cake crumb is formed by a two gel-forming system: starch swelling and gelatinisation, and a protein network denaturation and coagulation, both contributing to cake texture (firmness and cohesiveness) [31] [32] [33] . Hence, it is hypothesised that the HS-WPC powder could have influenced the formation of the starch-filled protein network as a result of the HS-WPC protein particles aggregating with exposed thiol groups, as well as interactions with other sulfhydryl groups from the egg or gluten. This potentially disrupted the network formation during coagulation and resulted in a weaker crumb structure. In addition, the sensory profile and physical properties demonstrated slight colour differences between the cupcakes. The HS-WPC cupcakes generally supported a colour profile more similar to the control cupcakes (i.e., more yellow colour) compared with the WPC cupcakes, as noted particularly by the sensory panel results. It was expected that the additional processes, which result in a heat-stable WPC powder, would impact positively the final product, leading to a creamier and smoother mouthfeel, potentially resulting from improved lubrication and/or reduced adhesion to the oral cavity [5, 7, 19, 34, 35] . It is possible that the trained panellists found minimal differences in the sensory profile between the two protein versions due to the cupcake model being relatively high in fat; therefore, any difference in processing or heat treatment of the whey protein, could have a greater effect in other foods models. Previous research, using heat-treated whey protein in liquid and semi-solid models, has demonstrated a positive effect on product sensory profile [35] . Liu et al. noted heat-treated whey protein can result in rough and dry perception if particles sizes are above the detection threshold [35] . Therefore, future studies should consider not only the processing and heat stability of the whey protein powder, but also the particle size.",

[16] noted that hard and dry products typically need more chewing and time in the mouth prior to swallowing. Furthermore, adding butter to cake and toast significantly decreased number of chews, presumably from increased lubrication [16] . In addition, fat is suggested to provide flavour, taste and mouthfeel [21] . Our work builds on the Engelen et al. [16] findings by demonstrating that using a high fat topping can alter the mouthfeel attributes by reducing chewiness and mouthdrying, as well as increasing rate of breakdown and clearance. van Eck et al. [17] also proved that toppings (such as firm cheese, cheese spread and mayonnaise) can reduce dryness and firmness and increase flavour perception of bread and crackers. It was suggested that this is due to saliva aiding bolus formation, whilst the nature of the topping and the product characteristics also influence the extent of change in perception [17] . More specifically in whey protein models incorporating ingredients such as butter into cream cheese improved flavour and liking [10] . Furthermore, this highlights that the use of toppings can make foods more acceptable and reduce negative mouthfeel attributes; accordingly, could be a viable route for improving the protein intake of older adults.",

            "text": "This paper demonstrated, despite using four different mitigating strategies in two different whey protein food models, that these strategies had limited effect on suppressing whey protein derived mouthdrying. Fortifying WPBs with lactose significantly reduced mouthdrying to a small extent; however, this correlated with increased sweetness highlighting cross-modality, rather than physical modification, as the probable mechanism. Increasing fat levels in whey protein fortified scones (via clotted cream) significantly reduced mouthdrying. However, increasing fat levels in WPBs did not significantly reduce mouthdrying. Hence, these results suggest increasing lubrication could be more relevant in a solid model compared with the liquid model. Heat-stable WPC in cupcakes had no significant effect on reducing perceived mouthdrying but lead to some improvements in the physical properties compared with WPC cupcake. This work highlights the challenges to mitigating mouthdrying; however, there is a clear need to explore methods of improving lubrication in the mouth. Developing our understanding of the proposed causes of whey protein derived mouthdrying remains key so that fortified products can be reformulated to improve the sensory profile and subsequently mitigate mouthdrying. This has relevance for the growing whey protein fortified products market for both older adults and the sport, health and lifestyle consumers.",
