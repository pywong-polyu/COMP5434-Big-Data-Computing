The World Health Organization (WHO) declared in 2019 that vaccine hesitancy was one of the ten greatest global health threats, alongside antimicrobial resistance, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and climate change 2 . Vaccine hesitancy can have grave effects, such as the global increase in the incidence of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, with recent outbreaks occurring in middle-and high-income countries 5 . Vaccine confidence varies significantly around the world and is dangerously low and falling in some countries. Hesitancy occurs in low-, middle-, and high-income countries alike, and may be found among people in all socioeconomic, religious, and ethnic groups 6 . The trend of increased hesitancy and lack of confidence in vaccines is also associated with a broader erosion of public trust in scientific and governmental efforts to maintain public health 7 this erosion has been exacerbated by the speed and intensity of information exchange, in news coverage, and social media. The public's capacity to distinguish reliable, evidence-based information from falsehoods has been compromised, a phenomenon described by the WHO as an infodemic 8 .",

Safe and effective vaccines against COVID-19 were developed very quickly once the genome of the virus was sequenced. From December 2020 to early June 2021, more than 2 billion people have been vaccinated against COVID-19, but with great inequity among and within countries. Mechanisms to foster a sense of collective responsibility are needed to ensure affordability and sustainable financing of COVID-19 vaccines in low-and middleincome countries, which are home to about 85% of the global population and often lack the resources to purchase, stock, and distribute adequate quantities of vaccines. This is why we unconditionally support the concept of vaccine internationalism, favouring an equitable and coordinated global vaccination approach as stated by WHO's Vaccine Equity Declaration, the COVID-19 Vaccines Global Access (COVAX) initiative, and the COVID-19 Vaccine Equity Project. However, even in high-income countries, like Spain, it is vital to ensure access to COVID-19 vaccines for marginalised populations, such as migrants, the homeless, people who use drugs, certain ethnic minorities, and the very poor, as they are the ones with major difficulties in accessing the health system 4 . Not only is this the right thing to do from a humanitarian perspective, but ultimately herd immunity is needed to create a firewall against the transmission of the disease and the generation of new variants, and it will be less successful if parts of the population are left largely unvaccinated. In this overall context, the positive public health benefits of newly available effective COVID-19 vaccines, including a single-dose vaccine, have not been realised in Spain.",

The devolution of power to the level of a specific region was a good faith attempt to make the work of each of the regional health services, which together constitute the national health system, more agile and responsive to local needs. However, inequalities, for example in the number of healthcare professionals employed, have increased in this system since the economic crisis a decade ago, and could be an added factor contributing to variation in regional COVID-19 vaccination rates. For this reason, we are now issuing a call to action for COVID-19 vaccination in Spain.",

Recent uncertainty surrounding rare adverse events associated with the AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson vaccines and the way these have been factored into government risk-benefit analyses have reinforced both supply constraints and vaccine hesitancy and represent an additional barrier to raising national vaccination rates and reaching those that are still most in need. Importantly, the recurrent reporting of negative news (for instance the vaccines' rare adverse events) in contrast to the publishing of success stories (such as the vaccines' proven capacity to save lives) further impacts people's perceptions of the risks and benefits of current policy recommendations. This has been compounded by the confusion generated by the new option in Spain of combining different COVID-19 vaccines based on limited evidence.",

In April 2021, 82 Spanish scientific societies called for the government to continue to work towards herd immunity 13 . Their 11 action points include combatting the infodemic contributing to vaccine hesitancy, and highlight the failure to address the critical challenge of clear communication to the public as a shortcoming of governments in Spain 7,14 . At the end of April 2021, 18 scientific societies again offered to assist the government with their vaccination programme 15 .

Governments must, for example, provide reliable information endorsed by trustworthy sources from throughout society, including health professionals and their scientific societies, patients and other non-governmental organisations, faith-based and community leaders, and other wellknown figures. In particular, European governments should strongly endorse and disseminate the European Medicines Agency (EMA) recommendations to the public and encourage the European Union (EU) to act as a bloc based on the best available scientific evidence, especially with regard to vaccines. Such consistent messaging across Europe will help re-establish societal trust in vaccination as a foundation of public health action.",
