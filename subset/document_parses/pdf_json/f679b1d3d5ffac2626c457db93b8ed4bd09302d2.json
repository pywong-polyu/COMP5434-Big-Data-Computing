SARS-CoV-2 antagonises the innate interferon response, but whether it manipulates innate cellular immunity is unclear. An unbiased proteomic analysis determined how cell surface protein expression is altered on SARS-CoV-2infected lung epithelial cells, showing downregulation of activating NK ligands B7-H6, MICA, ULBP2, and Nectin1, with minimal effects on MHC-I. This correlated with a reduction in NK cell activation, identifying a novel mechanism by which SARS-CoV2 antagonises innate immunity. Later in the disease process, strong antibody-dependent NK cell activation (ADNKA) developed. These responses were sustained for at least 6 months in most patients, and led to high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokine production. Depletion of spike-specific antibodies confirmed their dominant role in neutralisation, but these antibodies played only a minor role in ADNKA compared to antibodies to other proteins, including ORF3a, Membrane, and Nucleocapsid. In contrast, ADNKA induced following vaccination was focussed solely on spike, was weaker than ADNKA following natural infection, and was not boosted by the second dose. These insights have important implications for understanding disease progression, vaccine efficacy, and vaccine design.",

Despite this, our understanding of ADCC following infection and vaccination in humans remains limited.

Using these systems, they have shown that ADNKA-inducing antibodies are generated following SARS-CoV2 infection 14, [17] [18] [19] , are induced by vaccination in humans 13, 16 , and can be mediated by a subset of neutralising monoclonal antibodies targeting the spike protein [20] [21] [22] . However, these responses have not been tested against SARS-CoV2 infected cells; the presence, abundance, accessibility, and conformation of viral glycoproteins can be very different during productive infection. Furthermore, although viral entry glycoproteins such as spike can be found on the infected cell surface, and can mediate ADCC, other viral proteins can be the dominant mediators of ADCC during infection; indeed, we have shown that in other viruses, nonstructural proteins are often the dominant targets 23 .",

We found that SARS-CoV2-infected cells downregulate multiple activating NK ligands, resulting in a reduced NK cell response to infected cells. This suggests a novel mechanism by which SARS-CoV2 counteracts innate immunity early in infection, to establish disease. The development of humoral immunity following natural infection resulted in robust ADNKA against infected cells, and high levels of proinflammatory cytokines; these responses persisted for at least 6 months in most patients. Proteomics identified four cell-surface viral proteins capable of driving this response, leading to the surprising discovery that ADNKA is not primarily driven by spike antibody, but was dominated by antibody to other viral proteins such as nucleocapsid, membrane and ORF3a; this defines a novel role for antibodies targeting the immunodominant nucleocapsid protein. In agreement with these findings, and in contrast to studies using plate-bound protein, spike was a poor activator of ADNKA following vaccination when tested using infected cells. This implies that the breadth and magnitude of ADNKA responses is limited in current vaccination strategies. The inclusion of antigens such as nucleocapsid would recruit additional effector mechanisms, and may help maintain vaccine efficacy following mutation of spike in naturally circulating virus variants.",

The decrease in cell surface expression of heparan sulfated proteins may therefore enable the egress of viral particles and prevent super-infection, and is reminiscent of the capacity of other viruses to downregulate both primary viral receptors and co-receptors 43 .",

MHC-I proteins HLA-B to HLA-E were upregulated in cluster 5, likely reflecting a late IFN-mediated upregulation, while HLA-A was unchanged. By contrast, the activating NK-cell ligands MICA, ULBP2, B7-H6 (NCR3LG1), and Nectin1 (which is inhibitory in mice, but recently reported as activating in humans 44 ) were significantly downregulated in cluster 1.

            "text": "In addition to their role in innate immunity through interactions with activating and inhibitory NK receptors early in infection, NK cells play additional roles following the development of adaptive immunity via ADNKA/ADCC, in which CD16 interacts with the Fc portion of antibodies bound to targets on the surface of infected cells. To analyse this aspect of NK function, PBMC were incubated with infected cells in the presence of sera from individuals that were seronegative or seropositive for SARS-CoV2. Certain NK cell subsets degranulate more effectively in response to antibody bound targets. These NK cells can be differentiated by the presence of NKG2C and CD57 on the cell surface 47 . However, NKG2C is only found in a subset of donors who are HCMV seropositive, and a proportion of these individuals are NKG2C null due to a deletion in the KLRC2 gene. As a result, NKG2C cannot be used as a marker in all donors. We have previously shown that CD57 is sufficient to identify higher responding NK cells in all donors, and activation of this population correlates with the ability of antibodies to mediate ADCC 48, 49 . We therefore focussed on this population here; identical patterns of activation were observed in the CD57 negative population, albeit of slightly smaller magnitude (not shown). Non-specific activation was controlled for by testing against mockinfected cells throughout. Degranulation (Fig 4A) , as well as production of IFN\u03b3 ( Fig 4B) and TNF\u03b1 (Fig 4C) , were all significantly increased in the presence of serum containing anti-SARS-CoV2 antibodies, across a range of different NK donors (Fig 4D-F) . ADNKA was dependent on virus replication, since heat inactivated virus did not lead to serum-dependent NK degranulation (Fig S4A) . NK cells were activated equivalently whether purified NK cells or PBMC were used (Fig S4B) , thus these responses are due to direct stimulation of NK cells, rather than other cells responding to antibodies and releasing NK stimulating cytokines. Viral immune evasion can therefore be overcome through antibody dependent mechanisms, suggesting that in addition to neutralising virus, SARS-CoV2 antibodies may aid virus clearance through ADCC.",

Although memory B-cell responses persist, levels of circulating antibody can decrease over time following resolution of disease, such that in some mildly infected people they become undetectable after a few months [50] [51] [52] . To determine whether the same was true of ADCC responses, we assessed ADNKA in a cohort of donors with known disease status, for whom longitudinal sera were available ( Fig 4G) . ADNKA responses were generally of greater magnitude in individuals with more severe disease, with responses remaining detectable during the 150-200 day follow-up. Amongst those with milder disease, strong initial responses were maintained over time, while weaker responses decreased, becoming virtually undetectable by around 200 days. There was a significant correlation between the ability of antibodies to neutralise SARS-CoV2, and to activate ADNKA in response to SARS-CoV2 ( Fig   4H) , with a R 2 value of 0.7. Thus, although the antibodies mediating these activities may be induced in a similar manner, the antibodies mediating the two responses may not be identical.",

Furthermore, comparing the relative abundance of viral proteins in PMP, ORF1ab was only present at very low levels (1% of all viral proteins, significantly lower than any other SARS-CoV2 protein). Taken together, it is unlikely that any NSPs are surface-exposed. Nevertheless, we performed bioinformatic analysis of all viral proteins for the presence of potential transmembrane domains or signal peptides, revealing five additional candidate cell-surface proteins. We transfected cells with previously validated expression constructs for each of these genes 53 , and screened them for their ability to activate NK cells in an antibody dependent manner. We used sera from patients with severe covid19 disease, that had previously generated the strongest ADNKA signals against infected cells ( Fig   5B) . As expected, spike primed a substantial ADNKA response. However, in support of our PMP data, expression of ORF3a, Membrane, and Nucleocapsid, were also capable of priming ADNKA in the presence of serum containing SARS-CoV2 antibodies.",

This is emphasised by the identification of multiple interferon antagonists encoded by SARS-CoV2, and the increased disease severity in patients with genetic and acquired interferon deficiencies 38, [55] [56] [57] . To determine whether the virus evades other components of the host immune system we took a proteomic approach to systematically analyse how SARS-CoV2 infection manipulates the cell surface during the time course of SARS-CoV2 infection. We find that SARS-CoV-2 remodelling of the plasma membrane leads to the downregulation of multiple cell surface immune ligands involved with the interferon response, cytokine function, and NK activation. This may enable SARS-CoV2 to evade numerous effector arms of the host immune system. Of particular interest, downregulation of NK activating ligands inhibits NK cell activation, and is therefore likely to play an important role in the ability of the virus to establish initial infection. Later in disease, following the production of antibody, ADNKA leads to significant degranulation, and production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Somewhat surprisingly, spike antibody is not responsible for the robust ADNKA which develops after natural infection, and only weak ADNKA is generated following spike vaccination.",

NKG2D is ubiquitously expressed on \u03b3\u03b4 cells and CD8+, as well as some CD4+, T-cells in addition to NK cells 60 . Targeting NKG2D ligands may therefore enable the virus to impact additional effector mechanisms beyond just NK cells. Amongst NKG2D ligands, MICA is particularly polymorphic (100+ alleles), A549 cells express MICA*001/004 61 , while the truncated MICA*008 is the most common allele worldwide. This diversity is largely driven by co-evolution of humans with virus infections, and reflects the broad repertoire of viral immune-evasins 60 .

However, inflammation dominates severe COVID-19 disease 62, 63 . The high levels of TNF\u03b1 and IFN\u03b3 observed following ADNKA are likely to exacerbate disease under these circumstances. In support of this, TNF\u03b1 and IFN\u03b3 correlate with severe disease 64 , and critically ill patients have a higher proportion of afucosylated antibodies that may promote a stronger ADCC response 65 . Given that ADCC can potentially contribute to both protection and immunopathology, it is important to understand what determines the magnitude and quality of the ADCC response. Viral entry glycoproteins are a common focus as mediators of ADCC. E.g. ADCC mediated by Env antibodies have been a major focus in HIV 66 , and gB-specific antibodies have been studied in HCMV 67 . Although antibodies targeting these antigens can clearly bind infected cells, using similar approaches to the present study we recently showed that non-structural accessory proteins were more potent ADCC targets during HCMV infection 23 . This conclusion is reinforced here, where the neutralising antibody response is dominated by spike, but spike antibodies are poor activators of ADNKA, with other viral antigens driving more efficient ADNKA following natural infection.",

            "text": "Importantly, the ability of monoclonal spike antibodies to bind to infected cells did not correlate with their ability to mediate ADNKA, implying that the epitope, position, or angle, at which the antibody binds to the cell surface is critical; it's notable that 4/5 anti-spike antibodies that activated ADNKA bound the NTD, suggesting that this site is structurally advantageous for Fc-mediated responses. A similar phenomenon may underly the greater ability of non-spike antigens to generate a ADNKA response. Nucleocapsid, ORF3a, and membrane are all present on the infected cell surface, and can promote ADNKA if appropriate antibodies are present. Antibodies targeting ORF3a and membrane have been reported as present in only a subset of patients, while almost everyone infected with SARS-CoV2 develops antibodies targeting 68 . Nucleocapsid is therefore likely to be the major target for ADCC during natural SARS-CoV2 infection in most people, identifying a potential functional role for antibodies binding this immunodominant target for the first time. Influenza nucleoprotein is also detected at the plasma membrane [69] [70] [71] , and antibodies targeting nucleoprotein can mediate ADCC [72] [73] [74] . Structural proteins involved in genome packaging may therefore represent a common target for ADCC across multiple virus families.",

In contrast, and despite their importance in antiviral protection 1 , considerably less is known about the role of Natural Killer (NK) cells in infection. NK cells bridge the innate and adaptive responses, and individuals with NK cell deficiencies suffer severe viral infections 2 . NK cells respond rapidly to viruses, directly killing infected cells by releasing cytotoxic granules. They promote inflammation through the release of TNF\u03b1 and IFN\u03b3, and influence the induction of both B-and T-cell responses. Once virus-specific antibodies are induced, antibody-dependent NK activation (ADNKA) is generated through antibody linking cell-surface viral antigens with NK cell Fc receptors and subsequent antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC).",

Virus variants may therefore evolve to evade ADCC responses as well as neutralising responses, supporting an important role for ADCC in protection. It is therefore significant that spike-vaccine generated antibody responses were poor ADNKA inducers when tested against infected cells. The addition of other viral proteins such as nucleocapsid to vaccines would engage a wider range of immune effector pathways. This approach might improve efficacy against both viral transmission and disease, resulting in vaccines that are more resistant to viral variants containing mutations that diminish antibody neutralisation84 .",

Samples were loaded in 90%A for 10 min before a gradient elution of 0-10% B over 10 min (curve 3), 10-34% B over 21 min (curve 5), 34-50% B over 5 mins (curve 5) followed by a 10 min wash with 90% B. 15s (100\u00b5L) fractions were collected throughout the run. Fractions containing peptide (as determined by A280) were recombined across the gradient to preserve orthogonality with on-line low pH RP separation. For example, fractions 1, 25, 49, 73, 97 are combined and dried in a vacuum centrifuge and stored at -20\u00b0C until LC-MS analysis. 24 Fractions were generated in this manner.",
