[6] [7] [8] In response to uncertainties and the increased popularity of this dietary approach, Public Health England commissioned an evidence review by the Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition (SACN). 9 The review was published following a joint working exercise (including the British Dietetic Association (BDA), Diabetes UK and others), 9 and concluded that there are 'beneficial effects of lower carbohydrate diets for some outcomes (HbA1c, fasting plasma glucose, serum What this paper adds \u25ba Healthcare practitioners in family practice reported that implementing low-carb has transformed many patients' metabolic health-and their own experience of practice. \u25ba Low-carb practitioners were unusually-attentive to patients' diets, adapting models of care to help patients experiment and address tensions between low-carb and dietary guidelines. \u25ba Further research should prioritise pragmatic and formative social-science analyses of low-carb approaches as 'complex interventions' across different healthcare settings and patient groups.",

Over the long term (12+ months), the review found no differential impact on body weight compared with other dietary approaches; impact over the short term was not considered. The report, currently in draft form, also found no harmful effects of carbohydrate restriction in the short term. However, it raised concerns about the impact of low-carb dietary adjustment on micronutrient, saturated fat and fibre intakes-and compatibility with low-fat, wholegrain approaches, which provide the basis for therapeutic, preventative and populationlevel 'healthy eating' advice. The SACN report highlighted limitations, uncertainties and complexities in the evidence base, many of which are endemic to nutrition science, in which practicalities of undertaking dietary research and funding requirements have impeded long-term 'high quality' trials, and professional consensus. 5 10 For example, the report noted: variations in definitions of low-carb and outcomes measured; difficulty in isolating the impact of carbohydrate restriction (specifically) from what could be attributed to weight loss (more generally-and could therefore be achieved with other dietary approaches); lack of studies measuring outcomes beyond >12 months. For these same reasons the BDA has resisted aligning with one particular approach. Instead, it has emphasised that dietary support should be focused on weight loss and orientated to individuals' preferences-following the finding that the 'ideal diet is the one that is best adhered to'. 11 The BDA has reasserted the importance of professional dietitians as 'the only regulated healthcare experts in diet and nutrition, [who] should form an integral part of the multidisciplinary team that cares for people with diabetes'. 7 There are an increasing number of healthcare practitioners (HCPs) in other clinical fields, especially family practice, actively promoting carbohydrate restriction for people with type 2 diabetes and the cluster of other related metabolic conditions that are involved in 'metabolic syndrome'. 12 These HCPs have connected to an international, grass-roots movement of scientists, clinicians and others who, based on their interpretation of the scientific evidence, 13-17 advocate for low-carb and 'very-low-carb'/ketogenic diets (20-50 g/day)-as a 'superior' 18 approach with 'untapped potential'. 19 These advocates have questioned the epidemiological studies on which guidelines such as the Eatwell Guide are based, and drawn attention to the physiological mechanisms involved in the metabolism of dietary components (eg, carbohydrate, cholesterol, saturated fats) and problems of insulin resistance and hyperinsulinaemia. 20 21 In the UK, interest in low-carb among HCPs has been spurred by influential general practitioner (GP), David Unwin, 22 who has observed improvements in patients' metabolic markers in individual case reports and retrospective analyses within his family practice. 23 Qualitative research is important for investigating the dynamics of food-related healthcare interventionswhich can be characterised as 'complex interventions' 24 due to their multiple elements and potential mechanisms of action. It is crucial to understand how such complex dietary interventions are undertaken, what they involve, how and why they work and for whom. [25] [26] [27] [28] Many such healthcare interventions are developed and adopted in the 'real-world'. This is the case for low-carb intervention, which has evolved as part of grass-roots activity within family practice. A starting point for investigating low-carb intervention is to capture the experiences of stakeholders. 29 This study provides important experience-based evidence 30 asking 'What are HCPs' experiences of employing low-carb intervention in family practice?' With low-carb gaining increasing traction, while the scientific evidence remains equivocal and challenging to interpret, 31 it is crucial to learn from this real-world evidence.",

Studies using a similar methodological approach have shown that, when HCPs are questioned about the practical details of what they do and say rather than being asked only about their opinions, their accounts align well with both patients' accounts and observations of practice. 35 Analysis began with writing summary field notes after each interview (noting particular areas of interest), reading transcripts and reviewing recordings (for data immersion and clarification). Types of activity were coded and indexed (presented here as 'themes' but produced within Smith's theoretical approach). Analysis was carried out July to October 2020 and was based on CC's reflective and thoughtful engagement with the data and the analytical process. 36 This included searching for unusual or contradictory evidence across the data set, and presenting/discussing findings with academic colleagues and research participants.

Low-carb practitioners understood the concept of 'realfood' as a useful first step for patients to reduce carbohydrates (often represented as traditional food using whole/intact and diverse ingredients 37 ). They felt that these messages were easy to understand, largely uncontroversial in society and avoided conflict with the advice of other healthcare professionals. They described working with patients to support their personal goals especially avoiding intensification of medication, and achieving weight loss. The low-carb way of eating was not presented as overly restrictive, and low-carb practitioners did not usually recommend 'carb counting' by standard definitions, 38 despite often suggesting the elimination of major sources of carbohydrate such as wheat flour, pasta, rice, potatoes.

Their perception was that for many people previous adherence had not led to improvement in key markers of healthwhich had discouraged them from proactively addressing diet with patients. These early adopters of low-carb intervention contended that low-carb 'works'-that is, as an evidence-based strategy for self-management-and that they had witnessed improvements in their patients' metabolic health. The findings are consistent with a previous survey of patient experiences of low-carb intervention. 44 Low-carb practitioners had become highly enthusiastic about initiating conversations about diet with patients and supporting dietary change. This finding is a notable point of difference with other studies that have conversely highlighted that HCPs in family practice tend to avoid conversations about diet and exercise with patients because of the perceived sensitivities of discussing lifestyle/weight, 43 as well as institutional factors such as limited nutrition education in clinical curricula, 45 short appointment times 46 and incentives that drive pharmaceutical interventions. 35 Low-carb practitioners reported personally monitoring patients, explaining physiology 47 and discussing the social complexities of everyday eating as part of consultations, in a way they had not undertaken previously. 26 Such care practices are known to be valued by patients, 48 but are increasingly constrained within the severe pressures of UK family practice.",

Further research on low-carb interventions should involve biomedical studies of clinical effectiveness and harms, and pragmatic, formative process evaluations of how they are being implemented in practice, 29 including the feasibility, appropriateness and meaningfulness of intervention. 51 It should explore different models of support, including the various technologies and care practices involved (eg, blood glucose monitoring systems; peer support groups; educational materials and messaging; and online/digital support).",

The 'shadowed data' reported here (experiences of patients, as reported by practitioners 32 ) also point to other important avenues for further investigation (eg, dietary 'habits', carb 'addiction', disordered eating 52 ) that may help address persistent questions about sustainability of low-carb eating and potential harms of low-carb when implemented in everyday life. 53 ",

Low-carb practitioners strongly advocated for the use of low-carb diets in the management of people with type 2 diabetes and related metabolic conditions. The successes described draw attention to the need for pragmatic, formative evaluation of low-carb as a 'complex intervention' (alongside physiological research), to justify, challenge and/or shape low-carb intervention in clinical practice. Social science analyses would elucidate how this intervention is carried out across different healthcare settings (eg, dietetics, endocrinology) and patient groups, how healthcare practices intersect with people's everyday self-management and how different forms of evidence are invoked and prioritised.",
