However, the pain symptoms, including neurological and musculoskeletal pain symptoms, are still poorly understood. Design: In this cross-sectional study, we investigated the prevalence of musculoskeletal and neurological pain symptoms among hospitalized coronavirus disease 2019 patients. Furthermore, the association of clinical and demographic factors with the prevalence of pain symptoms was also investigated. Result: We included 182 hospitalized coronavirus disease 2019 patients with a mean age of 48.86 \u00b1 13.98 yrs. Pain symptoms were reported by 61.54% patients (n = 112). Most common symptoms reported were generalized myalgia (n = 60, 32.96%), headache (n = 50, 27.47%), and low back pain (n = 41, 22.53%). Interestingly, neuropathic pain was present in 14 participants (7.69%). Logistic regression analysis revealed an association of pain symptoms with coronavirus disease 2019 severity, male sex, higher body mass index, and a history of addiction. Conclusions: Pain symptoms are common manifestation of coronavirus disease 2019. Generalized myalgia, headache, and low back pain are the three most common new-onset pain symptoms in hospitalized coronavirus disease 2019 patients. Further investigation of pain symptoms and their predictive factors are recommended, which may guide healthcare workers and policymakers to plan in this direction.",

Exclusion criteria were known history of chronic pain disorders, known psychiatric illness, serious concurrent illness preventing participation, and unwillingness for participation. A confirmed case was defined as a person with laboratory confirmation of COVID-19 infection, irrespective of clinical signs and symptoms. Real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction was used to confirm the SARS-CoV-2 infection. Sample size was calculated using a standard formula based on the prevalence from a recent similar study. 9 Clearance for the study was taken from institutional ethical committee (reference number: T/IM-NF/PMR/21/19). Patients who satisfied the inclusion and exclusion criteria were approached with the study proposal, and its future implications were explained. The participants signed an informed written consent that was approved by the institutional ethical committee.

Patients were asked to report whether they were experiencing any newonset pain symptoms after the diagnosis of COVID-19. We included only MSK and neurological pain symptoms. If pain was present, its location, character, and severity were noted. For MSK pain and headache, a pain severity of two or more (of 10) on Numeric Rating Scale was considered for inclusion.

There has been wide variation in reports of COVID-19-associated pain with very few studies evaluating pain symptoms in particular. This discrepancy in the incidence of pain symptoms may be ascribed to a difference in study objectives and surveillance methods. 9, 12, 13 In a recent retrospective study conducted by \u015eahin et al., 9 the reported prevalence of pain symptoms was 40.7% before the infection that increased to 82.5% during the infection. Knox et al. 12 conducted a prospective observational study in which 38.5% of COVID-19 patients presented with an active pain symptom. The higher prevalence of pain in our study can be attributed to several factors. First, memory bias could be avoided by cross-sectional evaluation of symptoms. Second, we evaluated pain locations in a more precise manner (e.g., hand pain or foot pain) in comparison with previous studies where a more generalized approach was undertaken (e.g., upper limb or lower limb pain). 9 Third, the inclusion of neuropathic pain might be another determinant for this high prevalence. Last, a difference in baseline demographic characteristics and virus properties are few other important factors that might have resulted in the difference in the pain incidence.",

            "text": "This direct invasion through ACE-2 receptors may result in MSK injury, pain, weakness, and fatigue, all of which are known to occur in COVID-19. [17] [18] [19] In addition, SARS-CoV-2 is known to cause cytokine storm that involves interleukin 6, interleukin 10, and tumor necrosis factor \u03b1. This cytokine storm may further induce or aggravate damage in various tissues, such as muscle and joints triggering pain and related symptoms. 5 Mao et al. 20 reported that COVID-19 patients displaying muscle symptoms demonstrated higher levels of creatine kinase and lactate dehydrogenase than those without muscle symptoms. 20 Other potential mechanisms known to cause MSK pain include virus-associated myositis or myopathy, rhabdomyolysis, and steroid-induced myopathy. [21] [22] [23] In addition, central nervous system involvement by the virus can also manifest as MSK tissue damage and pain. 20 Headache is another commonly encountered pain symptom of COVID-19, and the prevalence rate in past studies ranged from 6% to 21%. 7 Similar to myalgia/arthralgia, headache can also occur as a result of a direct viral invasion of the central nervous system or because of indirect effects of the virus. The virus has been known to directly invade the trigeminal nerve ending inside the nasal or oral cavity, potentially causing the headache. 24 Penetration and damage to central nervous system have been confirmed by isolating SARS-CoV-2 from cerebrospinal fluid by genome sequencing. 25 Furthermore, the neurotropism of the virus has been described as a potential mechanism of direct involvement of the nervous system. Besides the virus-specific factors, several triggers may contribute to the occurrence of the headache. These triggers may include psychological stress due to social isolation and/or diseaserelated anxiety, an adverse effect due to multiple drug prescriptions, or prolonged use of a mask during hospitalization. In a web-based study by Uygun et al., 24 COVID-19-associated Data are presented as n (%). headache was frequently long-lasting, bilateral, with a male predominance, and had resistance to analgesics. In our study, a higher prevalence of headache in moderate to severe disease supports the fact that neurological complications are more frequent in severe COVID-19. 20 Neuropathic pain is a rare pain symptom of COVID-19 and has been explored in lesser detail so far. Similar to headaches, neuropathic pain may result from direct invasion of the nervous system (central nervous system or peripheral nervous system) or due to virus-mediated immune reactions. SARS-CoV-2 can cause an imbalance between ACE-2 and angiotensin II in the spinal cord that might result in neuropathic pain. Moreover, cytokines and chemokines can lead to activation of nociceptive sensory neurons resulting in pain. 25 In addition, prolonged prone positioning deployed to improve oxygenation is known to cause direct injury of peripheral nerves. 26 Other well-known neurological complications of COVID-19 that might result in neuropathic pain include transverse myelitis, Guillain-Barre syndrome, etc. Moreover, there are also reports of mixed sensory-motor neuropathy in COVID-19 patients leading to neuropathic pain. 10 Nonetheless, the incidence and clinical characteristics of neuropathic pain need further investigation.",

In addition, a sex difference regarding the level of expression of ACE-2 and a protective role of female hormones or the location of ACE-2 on the X chromosome might explain this discrepancy. 24 Association of pain symptoms with disease severity is by the fact that cytokine storm is more frequently displayed by severe COVID-19 patients. In the past, addiction history (especially smoking), higher BMI, and medical comorbidities (e.g., depression) have all been linked to the prevalence of pain symptoms. 27 Nonetheless, an association of these factors with COVID-19-associated pain is yet to be established.
