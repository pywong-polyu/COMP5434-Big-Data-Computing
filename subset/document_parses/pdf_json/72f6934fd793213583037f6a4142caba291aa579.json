Convergent crises have amplified a growing chorus of voices and movements calling for new thinking and new practices to adapt to these shifts, mitigate their impact, and address their root causes through far reaching changes in social and economic life and values, including breaking with the free market paradigm. In the face of a historic choice between transition or multiple systems collapse that deepen injustice and threaten planetary survival, I make the case for expanding on liberatory tendencies in Extension programs to build capacities for response-ability to transition toward more just and sustainable futures.",

The convergence and increasing undeniability of these crises have opened a historic space to address the roots of structural problems in prevailing systems. Social movements that denounce the endemic nature of injustice and harm have grown in strength and visibility, persuading millions about the necessity for structural transformation in areas as diverse as policing, labor rights, caregiving, energy, climate, public health, and food production. Alarming evidence of human precariousness and political and ecological chaos highlighted by protest have shown current structures to be unjust and unsustainable, calling into question narratives of technological, racial, and civilizational progress through the free market. Ideas that were unthinkable less than a decade ago have become mainstream. Concomitantly, we see a return to robust public sector proposals after decades of privatization. Policy discussions increasingly focus on system wide change and how to overcome procedural obstacles to their implementation.",

I want to foreground Extension in discussions of transition, amplifying and extending calls from Extension professionals and scholar-practitioners for an expansive conception of Extension's mission as new public funds come online for precisely these purposes (Ostrom 2020; Peters 2021) . Extension has unique relevance for its embeddedness in communities, competence across diverse social and economic domains, its public mission, and its strengths in popular education, networking, and capacity building. This essay is intended as a provocation to creatively think about what might be possible through Extension in this critical moment. This potential exists in embryonic form in Extension programs and practices that embrace a liberatory ethos, what I call Liberation Extension, a persistent but often underappreciated current of Extension work, particularly in Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and Tribal Colleges and Universities. These deserve thoughtful consideration as a basis for reappraising Extension's mission.",

It was informed by previous discussions of Extension in Virginia Tech's Climate Action Commitment, where I participated on the Land and Agriculture subcommittee, and by my own research into Extension programs and development politics in Guatemala. The leadership team at VCE showed an openness and enthusiasm for dialogue and patience with my questions and incomplete understanding of their work. My call for explicit alignment with liberationist impulses in Extension echoes calls for politically engaged scholarship with movements for economic, racial, gender, and ecological justice (Hale 2006) . Insightful comments from three reviewers led me to examine the deeper history of inequality in Extension programs. This essay should in no way be construed as reflecting the opinions of Virginia Cooperative Extension, Virginia Tech, or COIA.",

In 2021, overall life expectancy in the US decreased by one year, two for African Americans, and three for Latinos (Andrasfay and Goldman 2021) . The two defining epiphanies of early COVID-heightened concern for essential workers and the heightened vulnerability of marginalized groups-were quickly subsumed by greed and politics. When racial disparities in COVID 19 mortality, evidence of extreme material inequality, became clear, Trump seemed to lose interest in stopping the spread (Serwer 2020) , his calculated neglect adding urgency to Black Lives Matter protests that erupted after the murder of George Floyd at the hands of police. Trump had already ordered meat processing plants to stay open and okayed faster line speeds in chicken factories, increasing injury and contagion among a mainly immigrant workforce (Colvin 2020) . Such actions, alongside the push to force everyone back to work, rendered visible the harsh edges of an economic system that routinely devalues the lives of working people in general, and of women, Black, and brown and disabled people in particular. Since then, COVID 19 and its uneven violence have become increasingly normalized.",

Spread through human encroachment on wilderness habitats, tracing circuits of accelerated multinational exchange, and arriving amid growing alarm about the climate emergency, COVID 19 serves as a stark reminder that deregulated growth and consumerism are chewing through and polluting ecological systems at an alarming rate, threatening the web of life (Bellamy Foster and Suwandi 2021; Wallace et al. 2020; Hickel 2020 ). As we race towards a sixth mass extinction (Barnosky et al. 2011) , a report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) warns that a rise of 1.5 \u00b0C is \"dicing with the planet's livability\" and calls for immediate decarbonization (IPCC 2021), and 230 medical journals describe global warming as the \"greatest threat to global public health\" (Atwoli et al. 2021) . The third IPCC report concludes that meeting climate targets requires a paradigmatic shift away from the growthoriented capitalist model (Bordera Rom\u00e1 2021). Warming disproportionately harms poor and farming communities in the Global South already reeling from decades of free market policies and who are the least responsible for rising temperatures (World People's Congress 2010).",

The Morrill Act of 1862 created land grant universities on Indigenous territory and raised additional funds through speculation on stolen land (Stein 2017; INFAS 2018; Ahtone and Lee 2021) . Agricultural programs in 1862 institutions served predominantly white farmers in the north and exclusively white farmers in former confederate states (Lee 2013; Whayne 1988) . The Morrill Act of 1890 banned racial preferences for federally funded colleges absent an alternative system, leading to the establishment of 19 \"separate but equal\" Black land-grant universities in southern states. In 1914, when the Smith-Lever Act formally created Extension in 1862 land grants, it rerouted funds for 1890 institutions through 1862 schools, which withheld aid from Black Extension programs that already faced egregious discrimination in the south (Whayne 1988; Harris 2008) . Extension discrimination contributed to a \"cavernous information gap between Black and white farmers\" (Grant et al. 2012, p. 15) , and was instrumental in the emergence of the conservative American Farm Bureau Association (AFBA) (Kile 1948; Campbell 1962; Patel and Goodman 2019) , the largest (US) farmer organization, which has a long history of racism, and is a powerful lobby for agribusiness monopolies, free trade, and subsidies which disproportionately benefit white farmers (Boyd and Faber 2020) , while opposing farmworker rights, environmental regulations and independent farmer mobilization (Shearn 2012; Raderstorf 2020).",

This is unfortunate, given Extension's potential relevance to these conversations, but it likely reflects the conservatism of 1862 Extension programs, typically encountered in the dominant framing of Extension's role as the apolitical transfer of technology and information, application of proven programs, and evidence-based approaches. Extension often reflexively frames social and political problems as technical ones, and avoids contentious debates to maintain the perception of neutrality (Peters et al. 2018, p. 26) . Extension also promotes entrepreneurialism and resiliency, training communities to navigate markets and risk in an economic system in which corporations have more and more control, opening limited spaces of freedom within unequal and often hostile structures (Rose 1999) . Guatemalan Extension programs played a key role in implementing \"apolitical\" counterinsurgency development programs Indigenous communities (Copeland 2012 (Copeland , 2019 . Under the guise of neutrality, such programs support the status quo, offering a limited vision of what Extension could accomplish. Extension tends to reproduce historic inequalities and systemic harms, not necessarily on purpose, but by not challenging them, and because of affinities with existing partners and approaches as well as discomfort with expanding to new communities or seeming political. 1862 Extension programs have historically had mostly white leadership and most have only recently begun earnest internal conversations around race in the wake of Black Lives Matter protests. Extension professionals recognize the limitations of the tech transfer model, and many struggle to address systemic issues, but best practices alone cannot address these problems. Doing so requires engaging in dialogue about values, thinking critically about partners, and recognizing that there is no neutral stance outside of these issues (Kim Niewolny, personal communication; Colasanti et al. 2009 ).",

Some conservative state administrations have deliberately restricted conversations around Extension (Scott Peters, personal communication). However, many opportunities exist for a more proactive and progressive Extension practice. And much can be accomplished by making small but meaningful changes, consciously and deliberately, within existing programs.",

Such an Extension practice eschews neutrality, embraces a liberatory ethos, and sees itself as actively participating in, rather than simply responding to, processes of social change in solidarity with the poor and vulnerable. In order meet the challenges and seize the opportunities of the current moment, we should work to amplify these liberatory tendencies in Extension, with a conscious reorientation of institutional resources and attention towards the construction of economic, food, and socio-natural systems rooted in principles of fairness and ecological balance, and, simultaneously, to strengthen movements for far reaching transition policies. Liberation Extension allies with movements to construct alternatives that address structural contradictions in social and economic systems and invites working people to participate collectively in these processes. There is an ongoing conversation in Extension about how to build on existing work, to do it better, more systematically and effectively. In their recent volume about Extension professionals, for example, Peters et al. (2018) encourage us to \"open our collective imagination to possibilities for professionals to jump into civic life in ways that support the task of making democracy work\" (16).",

This movement must be strong enough to pressure the government to fund universal health care, renewable energy, public education, green public housing, public transportation, sustainable agriculture, food assistance, green jobs, and climate adaptation, and more, with equal access for everyone. Such policies are increasingly popular across traditional political divides, and could be more popular, but are blocked and maligned by powerful interests who work to mask systemic harms and use zero sum logics to divide working people. Constructing an economy based in economic and racial justice that operates within ecological limits requires displacing economic growth and capitalist wealth accumulation as central goals (Bellamy Foster 2000) . Capitalist growth (profit) disproportionately benefits the hyper-wealthy, while producing immense environmental destruction and waste, and is incompatible with the rapid decarbonization needed to arrest warming (Raworth 2017; Hickel 2020; Kallis et al. 2020) . The global capitalist economy was founded on colonialism, dispossession, and slavery, and requires military, prisons, and police to maintain endemic economic and racial inequality, nationally and internationally, stripping poor and racialized populations and nature of inherent rights in the quest to artificially cheapen labor and resources for capital This vision of change takes cues from proposals for a Green New Deal, which links social and anti-poverty policy to decarbonization (Aronoff et al. 2019) , movements for racial justice and decolonization, and from proposals for a Red Deal that seeks to build a mass movement for \"a world premised on Indigenous values of interspecies responsibility and balance\" (Red Nation 2021, p. 30). Like these proposals, this one also takes inspiration from Indigenous land and water defenders, climate justice activists, and food sovereignty movements worldwide. This reorientation of valuesa rethinking of security, well-being, citizenship, and justice, and a departure from capitalism and imperialism-is critical if we are to survive climate change without condemning much of humanity, following racial logics, along with nature itself, to disposability (Ajl 2020) .",

Relatedly, a commitment to overcoming interlocking forms of oppression could infuse Extension programming, materials, and pedagogy at multiple levels. Extension should be antiracist and feminist, prioritizing efforts to undo structures of racism and sexism that persist through neutrality and inaction, beginning with their own programs. My point is not that Extension should wave a flag to loudly advocate for radical change, which would not accomplish much and may not resonate with diverse publics. But it should prioritize the material needs, collective orientations, and organizational capacities of working communities and seek opportunities to creatively engage them in the processes of addressing the structural roots of their problems through co-imagining and co-constructing democratic and sustainable systems.

            "text": "My aim has been to highlight the dangers and opportunities in the current historic moment, connect Extension to discussions of transition, and highlight dialogues internal to Extension in hopes of building on existing liberatory initiatives and impulses. As Extension expands, it can respond to the needs of broader constituencies to build the organizational capacity for a transformed economy and society, or it can continue to support harm reduction in an unequal and destructive system. Neutrality is not an option. Liberation Extension is also an important step toward redefining the public land grant mission to include cultivating responseability for collaboratively formulating just and sustainable public responses to pressing problems. This is an ethical stance given the foundation of land grants through Indigenous dispossession and Extension's role in creating exclusionary and unsustainable economic systems and empowering reactionary farmer organizations. Working collectively to undo these legacies is the path to creating a more just and sustainable society.",

This rethinking must start with the recognition that dominant social and economic systems have produced harms and are now collapsing, creating problems that far outstrip the range of solutions from within these systems. COVID 19 has revealed that we are indeed capable of making dramatic changes on short notice, many of them long overdue, and that when the government fails to act, communities can step up to take care of one another. But we must use this opening to build far-reaching alliances for civilizational transition lest we continue to privatize and racialize the burden of societal and ecological collapse. I hope to combine the growing sense we must act boldly with the optimism that viable alternatives exist and that we can reorganize public institutions to help bring them to scale.",
