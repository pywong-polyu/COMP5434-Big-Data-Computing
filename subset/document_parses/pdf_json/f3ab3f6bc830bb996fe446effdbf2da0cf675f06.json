Patient characteristics upon admission and anthropometrics, waist circumference and hunger levels assessed during follow-up were analyzed across BMI categories. Results One-hundred-eighty-five COVID-19 survivors (71% male, median age 62.1 [54.3; 72.1] years, 80% with overweight/obesity) were included. Median BMI did not change from admission to V1 in normal weight subjects (\u22120.5 [\u22121.2; 0.6] kg/m 2 , p = 0.08), but significantly decreased in subjects with overweight (\u22120.8 [\u22121.8; 0.3] kg/m 2 , p < 0.001) or obesity (\u22121.38 [\u22123.4; \u22120.3] kg/m 2 , p < 0.001; p < 0.05 vs. normal weight or obesity). Median BMI did not change from V1 to V2 in normal weight individuals (+0.26 [\u22120.34; 1.15] kg/m 2 , p = 0.12), but significantly increased in subjects with overweight (+0.4 [0.0; 1.0] kg/m 2 , p < 0.001) or obesity (+0.89 [0.0; 1.6] kg/m 2 , p < 0.001; p = 0.01 vs. normal weight). Waist circumference significantly increased from V1 to V2 in the whole group (p < 0.001), driven by the groups with overweight or obesity. At multivariable regression analyses, male sex, hunger at V1 and initial weight loss predicted weight gain at V2. Conclusions Patients with overweight or obesity hospitalized for COVID-19 exhibit rapid, wide weight fluctuations that may worsen body composition (abdominal adiposity).

Specifically, we found that more than 30% of patients, evaluated 1 month after discharge from a hospital ward, had lost more than 5% of baseline body weight, and more than half were at risk of malnutrition [1] . Although body composition was not evaluated, it is likely that the weight loss observed in COVID-19 survivors was, at least in part, due to loss of lean body mass caused by systemic inflammation, muscle disuse and bed rest [2] . Unintentional weight loss, especially when associated with loss of fat-free mass, may negatively impact time to full recovery and patients' health status [3, 4] .",

It has been reported that weight regain in patients with critical illness is mainly due to expansion in the fat compartment [5, 6] , whereasto the best of our knowledge -no studies are available on the patterns of weight recovery in non-critical settings. Weight recovery after weight loss is often characterized by a greater rate of fat mass vs. lean mass recovery (a phenomenon sometimes referred to as \"preferential catch-up fat\") [7] , with the baseline percentage of body fat being a strong predictor of fat regain [8] . This might be particularly relevant in COVID-19 patients requiring hospital admission, as the majority have overweight/obesity and increased visceral adiposity [9, 10] . In these individuals, disproportionate regain in fat mass after weight loss might further worsen body composition, functional status and cardiometabolic risk.",

Full description of patient management and clinical protocols were previously published [11, 12] . Signed informed consent was obtained from all patients participating in this study. We included adult (age \u2265 18 years) patients with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 who had been admitted to and subsequently discharged home from a COVID-19 medical ward of San Raffaele University Hospital, and were re-evaluated one and three months after remission at the Outpatient COVID-19 Follow-Up Clinic of the same Institution from April 7, 2020, to October 6, 2020. The study size was defined by the time-window of the study. Confirmed COVID-19 was defined as positive real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) from a nasal and/or throat swab together with signs, symptoms, and/or radiological findings suggestive of COVID-19 pneumonia. Remission was defined as two negative RT-PCR from a nasal and/or throat swab performed 24 h apart, and no symptoms. Only patients with available anthropometrics (weight and height) recorded upon admission and at followup, and waist circumference recorded at both the 1-month and 3-month visits were included in the analyses. Patients admitted for other reasons and subsequently diagnosed with superimposed SARS-CoV-2 infection were excluded.",

Measuring weight and height on admission was not feasible due to the workload for nurses and physicians during the peak of the pandemic and the need for contact and airborne precautions in the hospital.

Weight loss was highly prevalent in COVID-19 survivors one month after hospital discharge. At three months after discharge, nearly half of patients had gained more than 2% of weight since the previous visit. Weight change patterns differed across BMI categories. Patients with obesity exhibited the largest weight fluctuations throughout the study period, whereas patients with normal weight were substantially weight stable and those with overweight exhibited an intermediate pattern. Abdominal obesity, as estimated by waist circumference, was present in most patients, both at one (62%) and three months (68%) after discharge. Consistent with the pattern of weigh regain observed, waist circumference significantly increased during follow-up, particularly in the overweight and obesity groups (Fig. 3) .",

            "text": "It is widely recognized that hospitalization associates with inadequate nutritional intake and weight loss [16] , and that loss of muscle mass is seen at an accelerated rate in catabolic illnesses, even with minimal weight loss [17] . COVID-19 has been postulated as a major cause of cachexia and sarcopenia (i.e., the reduction of muscular function in the presence of reduced muscle mass) due to marked elevation in inflammatory cytokines and immobilization [2] , and is in fact associated with clinically significant weight loss [1] . Recently, a small study that included COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICU who underwent sequential computed tomography scans confirmed that a reduction in both fat and lean body mass occurs in patients without or with obesity, with the latter experiencing a greater reduction in the erector spinae muscle cross-sectional area [18] . Thus, it is likely that subjects with overweight or obesity in our cohort lost a significant amount of lean body mass. The finding that waist circumference significantly increased in subjects with overweight or obesity suggests an increase in abdominal (and possibly visceral) adiposity in these patient categories, with further worsening of body composition. This observation is in line with previous reports on ARDS survivors indicating that the gain in body weight in the year following hospital discharge was mainly due to an increase in fat mass [5, 6] . We could not find reports on weight trajectories during and after acute, non-critical illness requiring hospital admission. Studies on weight recovery in patients with anorexia nervosa show that preferential trunk or visceral fat regain may occur after severe depletion of nutritional status [19, 20] . Increasing adiposity due to disproportional visceral fat regain may have detrimental consequences on health status, especially in overweight and obesity, which are often associated with cardiometabolic abnormalities. As in a vicious cycle, cardiometabolic risk factors may favor the development and/or worsening of sarcopenia [21] , which is often overlooked in patients with obesity. More than half of COVID-19 survivors in our cohort were older than 62 years. With aging, recovery of lean body mass may be challenging, thus increasing the risk of developing sarcopenia or sarcopenic obesity [22] . It should also be noticed that the prevalence of abdominal obesity was very high in our cohort, even among normal weight individuals. Abdominal adiposity as assessed by waist circumference is a strong and independent predictor of all-cause and causespecific mortality [23] , even among normal-weight subjects [24] . Our finding supports the association between visceral adiposity and risk of COVID-19 [9] or critical COVID-19 [25, 26] .",

            "text": "Subjects with obesity experienced the greatest weight fluctuations in our study. Individuals with obesity have greater energy storesboth as fat and lean mass -as compared with normal weight subjects. These are mobilized during critical illness, possibly explaining the greater weight loss and conferring a survival advantage vs. lean individuals [27] . At multivariable regression analysis, weight loss from baseline to the 1-month visit emerged as a significant predictor of subsequent weight gain. The likelihood of gaining weight increased by 9-10% for every 1% of weight lost from baseline. Consistently, the BMI gain from one to three months was greater in subjects with obesity as compared with lean subjects, who remained relatively weight stable throughout the study period. In a systematic review and meta-regression analysis of studies in which intentional weight loss (\u22655%) and subsequent weight regain (\u22652%) occurred, both the amount and the rate of weight loss were significantly associated with weight regain [28] . The timing of follow-up assessments did not differ among BMI categories in our study, suggesting that the amount rather than the rate of weight loss influenced weight recovery. Other predictors of weight gain during follow-up were male sex and hunger. Male sex increased by more than twice the likelihood of weight gain in the multivariable model including baseline BMI. Male sex has been shown to associate with unfavorable relative changes in lean mass as compared with female sex over a single weight cycle [29] [30] [31] . Thus, male patients with COVID-19 may not only be at risk of more severe disease [32] , but also of worsening body composition during recovery. Finally, for each unit increase in hunger assessed at 1 month, the likelihood of subsequent weight gain increased by 2%. Of note, while subjects with normal weight or overweight had returned to baseline BMI by three months after discharge and hunger levels had significantly decreased during follow-up, in individuals with obesity the BMI at three months was significantly lower as compared to baseline and hunger levels had not decreased. This is consistent with the evidence of a biological drive to regain weight after weight loss in obesity [33] . Weight loss after marked calorie restriction is associated with increased hunger and a strongly increased reward mechanism in response to food, in addition to other adaptive endocrine responses that may lead to increased food intake and weight regain [33, 34] . Recent evidence indicates that adipose tissue characteristics may also be involved [35] .",

First, body composition was not analyzed and waist circumference was not measured at baseline, although differences in waist circumference across groups were maintained during follow-up, suggesting that similar differences were present at baseline. Further limits of our study are the use of patient-reported weight upon admission and the lack of body weight assessment at discharge, which may have led to an underestimation of baseline BMI [36, 37] and of the magnitude of weight fluctuations. The lack of anthropometrics and body composition assessment during hospital stay was due to the unprecedented workload for healthcare professionals at the beginning of the pandemic, and to the restrictions imposed by the need of isolating patients to prevent viral spread. Finally, as most patients included in the analysis were White, our findings may not be generalized to other patient populations.",

            "text": "In conclusion, we report, for the first time to our knowledge, weight trajectories since hospital admission and changes in waist circumference during follow-up in COVID-19 survivors. Several considerations stem from our findings. First, COVID-19 requiring hospitalization is associated with rapid and wide fluctuations in weight that may worsen body composition (increased abdominal adiposity) in subjects with overweight or obesity. Fluctuations in blood pressure, heart rate, glomerular filtration rate, sympathetic activity, blood glucose and lipids that occur during weight fluctuation could put an additional load on the cardiovascular system [38] . Nutritional management strategies [39, 40] should be implemented during hospitalization and after discharge to improve both short-and longterm outcomes, and to reduce the risk of sarcopenia and cardiometabolic alterations. Second, our findings support the association between COVID-19 and visceral adiposity previously reported [25, 26] . Very few data are available in the literature on the association of abdominal adiposity and body composition on outcomes in patients hospitalized for acute conditions, either critical or non-critical. Even less data is available on the effect of critical and non-critical acute illness on body weight and composition. Our study contributes to filling this gap, and highlights the need for addressing these points with larger, more sophisticated studies. A better knowledge of the events occurring during acute illness and in the recovery phase in people with obesity might provide a better understanding of the pathophysiology of obesity and help improve clinical care.",
