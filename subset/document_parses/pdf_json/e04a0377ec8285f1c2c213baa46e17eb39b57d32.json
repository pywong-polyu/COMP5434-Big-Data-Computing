Similarly, the duration of disease course from onset to the time when 95% symptoms frequencies disappear also showed a rule that the severe type (33 d)> critical type (32 d)> the moderate type (26 d)> mild type (11 d) . Studies have showed that hospitalization durations of the death cases which belong to the critical type are short (14.70 \u00b1 9.60 days) [22, 23] , partly accounting for shorter duration of disease course of the critical type than the severe type. In addition, the dominant symptom in the critical type is dyspnea [24] , which necessitates respiration assisting equipment especially after the occurrence of consciousness disorders and may mask other symptoms.

The reduction of AFAPC before the transitions was related to the gradual reduction of virus-induced upper respiratory tract associated symptoms. The reduction of symptoms after the transitions was related to the aggravation of consciousness disorder, the use of auxiliary ventilation and the dyspnea.
