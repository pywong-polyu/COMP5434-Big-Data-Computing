The article finds that no explicit duty exists for cities to collect the data or information that they are regularly required to provide. While such a duty may be implied from Sect. 69 of the Water Services Act 108 of 1997, there is no clear indication of what information cities would need to provide. Furthermore, an extensive analysis of the current national systems of information operated by the Department of Water and Sanitation reveals that there are numerous and significant issues on these databases, especially concerning the quality, integrity, and timeliness of the data. Finally, the article proposes that due to the unique position of cities concerning the provision of water services, and the need for complete and reliable data, the law should emphasise cities' role in the collection of data.",

Accurately determining whether persons have access to water is necessary since the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, 1996 (Constitution) ensures that everyone has a right to have access to sufficient water. While the state is required to take reasonable legislative and other measures to safeguard the realisation of this right, cities (referred to interchangeably as local governments or municipalities) are placed at the fore-front in this regard. In terms of the Constitution, it is an object of local government to provide services to communities sustainably, and water services provision is a function of local government (Constitution, Sect. 152 (1)(b); Schedule 4 Part B).",

Most of the country's water legislation speaks to the DWS' duties to collect reliable data on, for instance, the status of the country's water resources, and water supply and demand. 1 The Strategic Framework for Water Services 2003 (SFWS) states that the Department will manage information to be used for monitoring, support, regulation, and planning (SFWS, p. 21) .

The National Water Resource Strategy (2013) (NWRS) provides that the DWS requires access to complete and reliable information to efficaciously execute its data-related duties (NWRS, p. 63) . A 2019 study on South Africa's monitoring and reporting of water supply goals and targets indicates that national data sources are available that report on the drinking water supply services in the country (Water Research Commission 2019a, p. 12). The latter data sources include the annual Statistics South Africa General Household Survey, the Statistics South Africa Census conducted every 5 years, and the Blue Drop System. Nevertheless, gaps exist in these national data sources, especially concerning the sustainability or continued supply of water services (Water Research Commission 2019a, p. 22) . Furthermore, there is a lack of city-level data on the water services they provide (Bauer 2020) . For example, strategies such as the Water Quality Regulation Strategy 2009 rely on the data submitted by local governments in the country, yet in some cases 63% of municipalities could not report on whether they meet drinking water quality standards or not (Masindi & Dunker, 2016) .",

The article will commence by investigating the need for data on water service delivery in cities, followed by an analysis of the current legislative responses. Next, the article will critically reflect on the DWS' national information system and the subsequent National Water Services Knowledge System (NWSKS) with the aim to determine the current success of the DWS' adherence to its duty to collect data and monitor the water provision services in the country. This includes the correlative duty on cities to provide information on their water service provision activities on request to the DWS. From this, the article argues that a need exists for the development of enforceable duties on cities to collect data of good quality and integrity. 3 The latter is necessary for improving the DWS' monitoring of water services in the country, while ensuring that cities have access to sufficient data on the water services they provide.",

Data integrity is known as an uncompromising adherence to certain ethical values, complete avoidance of deception, and strict honesty, as well as the state of being complete and whole, or entirely unimpaired (Kleppner, 2010) .

See Steyn 2020, pp. 288-300. 4 'Completeness' can be defined as the portion of stored data measured against the potential of being 100% complete. 5 'Uniqueness' involves that no one thing will be recorded more than once based on how it is identified. 6 'Timeliness' is described as the degree to which data represent reality from a required point in time. 7 'Data are valid if it conforms to the syntax (format, type, range) of its definition'. 8 'Accuracy' entails the extent to which data correctly describes the real-world thing or event that is being described. 9 Data 'consistency' entails the 'The absence of difference, when comparing two or more representations of a thing against a definition'. management technologies allow for rapid response times, have the capacity to transmit data between remote locations and data processing facilities, can capture realtime information, and provide the opportunity for the interpretation of data that are presented to end-users. These technologies may also promote knowledge networking between cities as envisioned by the country's water strategies. 11 The above technological interventions may be necessary, since the Master Plan firmly states that inadequate data and information caused by weak monitoring infrastructure and systems pose significant risks to both planning and decision-making, and should be addressed with great urgency through 'the formalisation of an effective national hydrological monitoring centre' (Master Plan, Volume 1 p. 43). The urgency is, arguably, driven by the fact that the lack of information from weak monitoring systems and information systems that are not maintained poses a substantial risk to attaining the goals put forward in South Africa's water legislation, policies, and strategies. 12 However, it is uncertain whether the current national information systems provide data of good quality and integrity concerning cities' water service provision, and, therefore, warrants investigation.",

A 'water services intermediary' is defined as any person who 11 See para 3 below for a discussion on the SFWS and knowledge networking. 12 Notably, the overarching goal of the aforementioned laws is to ensure that everyone has access to sufficient water (Constitution, Sect. 27(1)(b)). Cities or local governments have a significant role to play in achieving said goal, given their constitutional function to provide water services in the form of potable water supply systems to communities (Constitution, Schedule 4 Part B). Specifically, the minimum standard for basic water supply services is the provision of a minimum quantity of potable water of 25 L per person per day or 6 kL per household per month (Regulations Relating to Compulsory National Standards and Measures to Conserve Water 2001, Regulation 3). must provide water services to another by way of contract, where the provision of water is incidental or the primary purpose of the contract (WSA, Sect. 1(xxii)).

The public is entitled to reasonable access to the information in such a system, and the Minister must take reasonable steps to ensure that the information provided is in an accessible format (WSA, Sects. 67(3)-(4)). The WSA provides no explanation concerning what constitutes an accessible format, but from analysing the existing national information system, one may conclude that it involves processed data that provide relevant statistics and information about water services in the country. 14 The WSA stipulates somewhat ambiguously that the Minister may require any province, water services institution, or consumer to furnish information to be included in the national information system (WSA, Sect. 69). In the instance of water services institutions, it spreads the duty to provide information amongst water services authorities, water services providers, boards, and committees.

While it may be reasonable to argue that such a duty can be inferred, or that it is implied, the usefulness of the duty to furnish, supply, or provide information is questionable, especially since there is no clear indication of what information cities would need to provide. Given cities' unique position as water service providers, it is both puzzling and worrying that cities are not required adequately by the law to collect data and information on the water services they provide.

The information section (which is almost the same for all aforementioned sections) of the Access to Water Infrastructure Delivered section states that the data are provided by 'Water Services' and is 'updated monthly'. However, at the time of the writing of this article in March 2021, the Access to Water Infrastructure Delivered section provides that the 'latest data available' is from December 2020 (DWS, 2021a). The information section also states that the section 'indicates the percentage of population and households that have access to drinking water' (DWS, 2021a). The argument seems to be that once households have been provided with water infrastructure, they automatically have access to water. This is, perhaps, a significant flaw in logic, as even when households are provided with working water infrastructure, the sustainability thereof is not guaranteed (Allen and Lemme 2016) . In other words, it is uncertain for how long infrastructure may remain in working order, since it is often susceptible to breakages or malfunction.",

This dashboard aims to provide data on the functional access to basic water supply infrastructure, yet states that it is only updated once a year in April (DWS, 2021b). Currently, the only available data on this section are from July 2020 (DWS, 2021b). Since no continuous monitoring system is in place, it is conceded that it does not provide an accurate depiction of the state of functional water supply in the country. This is because, as mentioned in part two above, accuracy in terms of data entails the extent to which data correctly describes the real-world thing or event that is being described. As with the other sections on the Water Services dashboard, the information section states that, in terms of the status of the data, 'data are continuously updated; the data set(s) supplied are already historical on the day of supply' (DWS, 2021b) . It provides no evidence that there is some system in place that continuously monitors, for instance, water supply reliability. The dashboard does indicate that NIWIS may at any time request updated information (DWS, 2021b), but this information is not immediately made publicly available. Considering the purpose of the national system of information set out in the WSA, the outdated data provided on the NIWIS do not allow for accurately monitoring the performance of the water services sector (WSA, Sects. 68(b)(i)-(iii)). It is thus that the Master Plan advocates for the development of improved and modernised information systems to safeguard access to reliable data, information, and knowledge concerning the status of the country's water resources and supply (Master Plan, Volume 1, pp. 43-44).",

As mentioned above, 18 it constitutes an offence if a person gives misleading or false information when required to furnish information by the DWS (WSA Sect. 82(1)(e)). Thus, significant value is placed on the correctness of information in this regard. However, the information section pertaining to water services on the NIWIS states that as for the quality of the data: 'All data is supplied with no expressed or implied warranty as to its suitability for purpose, accuracy or completeness' (DWS, 2021a). The latter aspects of accuracy and completeness are of relevance here since both potentially amount to misleading or false information, yet on this occasion, it is provided by the DWS.",

The DWS is currently developing many water services systems. These include the Integrated Regulatory Information System, the Water Sector Policy Database, and the Technical Knowledge Centre. These developments, along with the NWSKS, debatably, present great promise for the advancement of the availability of data concerning water services provision. However, arguably, for databases such as the NIWIS and NWSKS to succeed and to be purposeful, cities need to take an active role in the collection of water services-related data. This may also contribute significantly to solving the challenge of insufficient water service delivery-related data in cities, and may strengthen cities' ability to provide water services to communities adequately.",

However, no duty exists for cities to collect the data or information that they require for decision-making, or are regularly required to provide. The absence of an explicit duty on cities to collect data, paired with the ambiguity resulting from the WSA's lack of specificity regarding the information that cities would have to furnish, means it is unlikely that cities would be able to fulfil such a vague obligation. The lack of and outdated data on the NIWIS and the NWSKS evidences this. There is also a deficiency in terms of regulations pertaining to, for instance, how data should be collected, including guidance on maintaining and ensuring the quality and integrity of data. Thus, while current plans and strategies emphasise that data and information are necessary for, amongst other issues, proper decision-making, cities struggle with the challenge of insufficient data on the water services they provide due to weak or absent monitoring systems (Parliamentary Monitoring Group 2017).",

The DWS fulfils its mandate through the establishment and maintenance of the NIWIS and the NWSKS. However, the above analysis of the NIWIS and the NWSKS revealed that there are numerous and significant issues on these databases, especially concerning the quality, integrity, and timeliness of the data. The WSA does state that water services authorities must provide the Minister with data upon request, but there is no clarity concerning this process, and how frequently it is required of water services authorities. Moreover, because of the absence of a dedicated duty on cities to collect the necessary water service delivery data, issues such as outdated data may persist. This raises the question of whether the current legal framework which centralises the collection of data is adequate.",
