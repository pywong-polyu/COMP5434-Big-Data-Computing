The authors also showed that the prepared silver nanoparticles were able to induce apoptosis in cervical cancer cells. They suggested that these silver nanoparticles could be used as an alternative therapy for cervical cancer. Still in the context of natural products, we received the submission of a systematic review published by Ombredane et al. In this article, the authors presented an important overview on the use of curcumin, a plant-derived molecule, in the treatment of breast cancer, and how nanoencapsulation could improve the effectiveness of this compound. This approach is interesting, because several plant-derived compounds have problems such as instability and/or solubility, issues that impair their use in biomedical applications.",

In this report, the authors describe a novel PLGA nanoparticle coated with red blood cell membranes and decorated with two different peptides. The aim of this interesting surface modification was to improve the crossing of the blood-brain barrier, a property that was achieved as shown in mice models for glioma. The strategy of using biological membranes in nanomedicine was also the subject of two review articles available in this edition. These two reviews, published by Ma at al. and Chen et al., described the potential use of extracellular vesicles, or exosomes, as candidate nanosized drug carriers for cancer therapy. These natural vesicles were the inspiration for liposome development, and are basically composed of a phospholipid bilayer containing cholesterol and also proteins, an organization resembling that of cell membranes. As the main advantage in comparison to liposomes, these natural vesicles can overcome natural barriers and can circulate freely in the bloodstream. Moreover, the presence of specific proteins on the vesicle surface can address these exosomes to specific target tissues. Limiting issues regarding the industrial biotechnology production of these natural nanocarriers are also discussed in the two review articles.",

Finally, Javed et al. reviewed some important aspects of gene signaling by miRNA as a potential therapy for colorectal cancer. The instability of nucleic acids requires the use of drug delivery systems, such as nanocarriers, that can protect and transport miRNA to target cells.",
