            "text": "BACKGROUND: The prospective DIabetes and CATaract Study II (DICAT II) was performed to characterise the risks of cataract surgery to the retinae of patients with early diabetic macular oedema (E-DMO). METHODS: DICAT II was a prospective, comparative, multicentre, observational study involving six Italian clinics. Patients were aged \u226555 years, had type 1 or 2 diabetes with spectral-domain optical coherence tomography evidence of ESASO classification Early DMO. Group 1 eyes (78 eyes, 78 patients) underwent phacoemulsification-based cataract surgery. Group 2 eyes (65 eyes, 65 patients) had E-DMO and either clear media or had undergone uncomplicated cataract surgery \u22651 year previously. Central subfield thickness (CST) and best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) were assessed in both groups. RESULTS: The negative impact of surgery on CST was evident after the first postoperative week; CST peaked during the first month, then rapidly decreased. CST worsening \u226510 \u00b5m was observed in 63/78 eyes (80.7%) and 29/65 eyes (44.6%) in Groups 1 and 2, respectively (p < 0.0001). CST worsening of \u226550 \u00b5m was observed in 51 eyes (65.4%) and 10 eyes (15.4%) in Groups 1 and 2, respectively (p < 0.0001). Mean CST worsening was lower in Group 2 than in Group 1 (38.6 \u00b1 30.4 \u00b5m vs 85.5 \u00b1 55.3 \u00b5m, p < 0.0001) with a lower BCVA loss (\u22122.6 \u00b1 3.5 letters vs \u22128.2 \u00b1 6.2 letters, p < 0.0001). Higher glycaemic levels and HBA1c levels were significantly associated with the risk of >50 \u03bcm CST worsening in eyes from both groups. CONCLUSION: Early DMO is associated with poorer outcomes after cataract surgery and requires close pre-and postoperative monitoring.",

In 2019, the International Diabetes Federation estimated that 240 million people were living with the disease (a prevalence of 9.6%): this will rise to 356 million (11.1% prevalence) in 2045 [1] . Moreover, this prevalence strongly increases with age, rising to over 20% in elderly subjects [2, 3] . Diabetes is pernicious: chronic hyperglycaemia affects cardiovascular, renal and neural systems. The visual system is no exception, where the disease is associated with damage of many ocular tissues, particularly the retina, but also the crystalline lens: a large proportion of people with diabetes will experience accelerated cataract development and require cataract surgery more frequently and at an earlier age compared with non-diabetics [4] .",

The risk of worsening of preoperative DMO after surgery, thereby reducing or even eliminating the visual benefits of cataract extraction is well known, and has prompted the use of prophylactic therapeutic measures [8, 9] . The risk of post-cataract surgery macular oedema development in diabetic eyes without preoperative maculopathy was unclear until a British retrospective database study [10] that employed an electronic medical record dataset containing over 80,000 subjects finally demonstrated that such eyes have a significantly increased relative risk of developing macular oedema after cataract surgery compared with normal eyes, and that this risk increases with the level of retinopathy: the relative risk was 1.8% in eyes without any form of retinopathy, but this rose to 6.6% in eyes with advanced retinopathy [10] .",

Even in diabetic eyes without DMO, the risk ratio of developing oedema compared to non-diabetics rises from 1.8 in subjects without any sign of retinopathy to 10.3 in the presence of advanced stages [10] . Topical NSAID use during the first months postoperatively reduces this risk [13] . According to DICAT I, 25% of diabetic subjects undergoing cataract surgery have preoperative DMO [7] ; this confers a high risk of macular worsening, potentially eliminating the vision benefits of cataract extraction [8, 10] . Intravitreal steroid or anti-VEGF therapy immediately before or even at the end of cataract surgery is very effective in reducing this complication [14, 15] . However, in clinical practice, the presence of DMO is considered to be 'clinically relevant' and the object of therapeutic attention only when a consistent increase in macular thickness, associated with alterations in retinal structure, is evident at OCT examination. The presence of one or a few microcysts often positioned at the foveal side and associated with minimal thickening (so-called non-clinically significant oedema, or pre-clinical oedema) is not normally of interest.",

This study demonstrates that E-DMO slowly worsens in less than 1 year, and that this worsening may become clinically relevant in over 10% of cases. Cataract surgery dramatically worsens this course in the vast majority of cases: in this study, 4 months after surgery, 51 eyes (65.4%) experienced CST worsening \u226550 \u00b5m with a visual loss >10 letters, which necessitated these patients being immediately withdrawn from the study, and started on appropriate therapy, per investigator's choice ( Table 2 ). Even forms of E-DMO with just one to two microcysts (such as those depicted in Fig. 1A ) may develop a clinically significant worsening (Fig. 3) . The highly negative effect of E-DMO was particularly obvious in the limited number of 16 bilateral patients, where systemic conditions could not confound the comparison: in 14 patients (87.5%) the operated eye worsened more than the non-operated eye of at least 10 \u00b5m, and in 13 patients (81.2%) the operated eye was withdrawn for CST worsening >50 \u00b5m. These results demonstrate that the negative impact of cataract surgery on E-DMO occurs very rapidly, lasts about 1 month, with the effects declining rapidly after the second month (Fig. 2C) . Higher baseline glycaemic values were a risk factor for oedema worsening after surgery.",

A number of descriptions of worsening DMO after cataract surgery exist, but this is largely old literature [8, 9] , and few trials used OCT for precise CST measurement. Given the recent coining of the term, no trials have previously examined eyes with E-DMO. In one prospective multicentre trial, the DRCR network studied 266 diabetic eyes with non-centre-involving DMO undergoing cataract surgery, and observed that centreinvolving DMO developed in 11.5% of eyes [17] . In another smaller prospective monocentre trial involving patients with diabetes who underwent cataract surgery, Chen et al. found worsening of DMO in 13/20 (65%) eyes enrolled [18] . Another feasibility trial conducted by the DRCR network that involved 63 eyes failed to generate conclusive results due to a lack of standardisation of DMO management among the involved centres [19] .",
