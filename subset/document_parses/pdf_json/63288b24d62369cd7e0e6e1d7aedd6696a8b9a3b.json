            "text": "The coronavirus pandemic has impacted the education systems worldwide and most, including the Israeli, have transitioned to online learning. Moreover, closing schools has extreme social, cultural, educational and economic implications on the student, teacher and parent populations. This is especially true for students from families of lower-socio-economic status and young students who need parental assistance. Furthermore, online learning is not suitable for all teachers, because some lack the technological capabilities needed. To examine the attitudes of teachers and students towards online learning, questionnaires were administered to 476 students, grades 3-7 and 250 teachers from the Arab and Jewish sectors. The findings revealed that age plays an important role both among teachers and students, where mainly younger children and older teachers encounter difficulties in this transformation. Furthermore, gender and sectoral differences were found both among teachers and students. These findings show that conversion to online learning may widen the existing gaps.",

Despite its advantages, apparently online learning does not suit all students and teachers. Presumably, the cessation of all activities in the schools, including extra-curricular activities, will have an effect, first and foremost, on students from the weaker social strata (Reich et al. 2020; UNESCO 2020) , mainly because of their lack of digital means. This is combined with the fact that school for these students is one of the three main frameworks in which they spend most of their day, with the second being informal extra-curricular frameworks such as after-school centres and lastly their home.

The combination of the constructivist approach and the principles of online learning and its application in teaching processes makes it possible to create SN Soc Sci (2021) 1: 71 71 Page 4 of 23 an environment in which the education approach which places the student at the center can be expressed, strengthens his involvement in the studies and encourages development as an independent learner with self-direction, abilities and capabilities to build his knowledge and form connections between the contents with the goal of building new knowledge (Amzalag and Masry-Herzallah 2021; Ford and Russo 2006) . The \"classic\" format of online learning was founded on asynchronous teaching, where the technology connects the students and the teacher with no dependency on time and place. This includes independent reading and individuality of study material, performing different tasks with the aim of strengthening the command and comprehension of the material, and examining these skills by means of the system (Reid-Martinez and Grooms 2018). After years of online learning in this manner, in recent years different models have been developed such as synchronized learning, where the technology connects the students and the teacher, requires attendance at the same time, but not necessarily in the same place (Chauhan 2017) .",

In contrast to regular programs, online learning enables more flexibility, and increases access (Bryant and Bates 2015) . However, some of the students do not succeed in forming effective interaction with the teachers and their peers through the Internet, creating problems for them and for the teachers. Different studies indicate the importance of the interaction that occurs in the online environment, the lack of which creates a sense of isolation thereby increasing the risk for dropout or scholastic failure (Shelton et al. 2017) . Online learning (synchronous and asynchronous) is usually structured around written communication which can be more calculated and profounder than verbal learning (Fedynich et al. 2015) . Exposure to pedagogic applications and online teaching strategies including experience with them during the learning process by means of investigative, dialogic and experiential learning assists the learners to function better in the technological environment during the process and will help improve their functioning later in life (Campbell 2018; Dabbagh 2007) .",

These studies indicate that online learning does not suit every student in the education system and may affect the principle of equal education among students (Schleicher 2020) . This is due to the fact that not all students in the education system enjoy the same environmental conditions at home that allow them to study online (Welner 2020) . In addition, the presence and support of parents who can assist their children with these studies is not available to all students, because not all parents are accessible for this purpose or technologically capable. Further to the digital divide, online learning relies on the extensive involvement of parents of young children and in older ages on their ability to independently study. Parental involvement and independent study are obviously affected by the socio-economic background of the students' families and their families' cultural capital. Thus, even if we exclude the digital divide, the online learning model might broaden the existing educational gaps, in any case (Schleicher 2020) . The initial evidence of the growing gap in the transition to online learning can be found in current research on the subject of complete online learning schools. These studies found that in general students who study in this type of school achieve lower grades and fail more frequently in comparison to students at regular schools. Seemingly, the students affected most are those with low achievements (Ahn and McEachin 2017; Fitzpatrick et al. 2020 ).",

The students of these generations are characterized by their wide use of digital search banks and digital interpersonal communication. To a certain degree we can even say that their socialization process is done via the internet. Their response rate is rapid and they search for quicker solutions than others (Seemiller and Grace 2017) . Consequently, this reality warrants drastic changes in the definition of the role of the teacher who will be asked to teach online, as not all of the teachers are qualified for the pedagogic and technological changes that are necessary in online learning models (Anderson et al. 2019) . Actually, while the students are Z and Alpha generation students, frequently the teachers belong to the X-generation. At times this generation is denoted \"digital immigrants\" (Prensky 2001) , because they are immigrants to the digital world of the next one or two generations. This migration might be accompanied by great frustration, especially when the teacher is required to incorporate distance teaching, namely teaching that demands different skills than those needed in the traditional teaching process (Luthra and Mackenzie 2020) . This is especially true during times of crisis such as the outbreak of the corona pandemic, when the teacher also takes on the important role of strengthening the students' psychological wellbeing (Elias et al. 2019) .",

These gaps are of the highest among the OECD countries (Blass 2019) . These gaps are expressed in entitlement to matriculation certificates in different regions in Israel, with a clear connection between socio-economic strata and the rate of success on matriculation exams (Weiss 2018) . Furthermore, the data regarding Meitzav (school growth and efficiency measures) exams indicate gender-related gaps between boys and girls in favour of girls in all levels of education and in all subjects including mathematics and technology (Ayalon et al. 2019) . In more than 24% of the homes in Israel there is no Internet and in 15.7% there is no computer.

In the context of integrating computerization and information technology in the education system in the Arab sector, studies show extensive gaps in reference to computerization and information technology between schools in the Jewish sector and those in the Arab sector (Husny-Arar and Massry-Herzallah 2016). This divide has intensified the digital gaps that exist in any case between the Jewish and Arab societies and affects the extent of the use of digital means in education on a daily basis, with implications on the degree of preparedness for use of these means during times of crisis. This situation has had a significant effect on the preparedness of the Arab sector in the education system in emergency times during the breakout of the coronavirus, which limits the number of students (and part of the teachers) who participate in online learning. About half of the Arab students are not continuously connected to online learning; in some areas online learning does not transpire due to lack of infrastructure, shortage in suitable end devices and lack of the ability of parents to help their children and digital divide in the Arab society. Also, the level of preparedness of the schools and the investment in training the staff in the Arab society is lower than the Jewish society. Moreover, the central platform for online learning is based SN Soc Sci (2021) on the Hebrew language only in addition to the scarcity of digital contents, video clips as well as presentations in Arabic (Dahan et al. 2020) . Seemingly, during the coronavirus crisis and the transition to online learning there has been little reference to the fact that not all the students in the education system enjoy the same environmental conditions at home that allow them to learn online. The presence and support of parents who can assist in learning is absent at times. The support of parents is critical for young students because online learning relies on greater parental involvement for young ages and the ability to learn independently in the older ages.",

For the students we chose to examine personal variables (age, gender and grade level), in addition to the variable of asking for help.

To enjoy the most cooperation to participate as possible the questionnaires were constructed so that they would be as brief as conceivable while taking into consideration the task load that characterizes the period of the coronavirus pandemic. The questionnaire for the teachers included 18 statements designated to examine three main variables: (1) extent of the use of online teaching. This variable included three statements, e.g. \"at what frequency did you initiate online lessons and were in contact with the students?\"; (2) technological abilities. This variable included four statements, e.g. \"to what degree would you define yourself as a digital/technological person?\"; (3) positive attitudes towards online teaching. This variable also included four statements, e.g. \"to what extent does online teaching facilitate contact with your students\". In addition, the questionnaire included demographic questions such as age, gender, sector, grades and subjects taught. The questionnaire for the Arab teachers was translated to Arabic. To check whether the questionnaire meets psychometric standards, a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and reliability tests were conducted (see results of CFA and reliability analysis below). As can be seen from the results, the questionnaire meets these standards. The students' questionnaire was also constructed especially for this study and was also designated to be as brief as possible. The questionnaire included 19 statements intended to measure four variables: (1) success in studying online. This variable included four statements, for instance: \"to what degree did you learn new things via online learning?\"; (2) technological capability. This variable also included four statements. For example: \"to what degree do have command of the use of the Internet?\"; (3) attitudes towards online learning. This variable also included four statements, e.g. \"to what degree does the online learning method allow you flexibility and suitability to your schedule?\"; (4) asking for assistance. This variable included three statements designated to measure the degree to which the student asked for help from others in order to cope with online learning. For example, \"to what extent did you use the help of peers with online learning?\". The questionnaire included demographic questions such as age, gender, sector, grades and so forth. The questionnaire for the students studying in the Arab sector was translated to Arabic. The questionnaire underwent a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and reliability tests and was found to meet the accepted standards as shall be detailed later. The scales of the answers for the two questionnaires (the teachers' questionnaire and students' questionnaire) were measured on a 5-point Likert scale (1 = \"not at all\", 5 = \"very much\").",

            "text": "The research hypotheses assumed that a correlation would be found between the sector, gender and type of school (elementary/middle), and the dependent variables: the frequency of the use of online teaching, technological abilities and attitudes towards online teaching. In order to examine the research hypotheses, a Three-Way MANOVA analysis was conducted. The model tested was in the form of 2 (male/female) \u00d7 2 (Jewish/Arab sector) \u00d7 2 (elementary/middle school). Eight teachers that reported teaching in other sectors rather than Jewish or Arabic were excluded from this analysis, as well as all analyses in which sector was a factor. We did not find any three-way interaction for the extent of use of online teaching, F(1,231) = 0.51, p = 0.48, or for the technological ability variable F(1,231) = 0.29, p = 0.59, or the attitudes variable F(1,231) = 1.85, p = 0.18. Two-way interactions were also not found. A main effect was found with reference to the gender variable for the dependent variable of technological ability, Table 5 Averages of the main study variables measured for the students, their internal reliability and the correlations between them N = 476; in parentheses = Cronbach's alpha internal reliability score M mean, SD standard deviation *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01; ***p < 0. Because almost no differences were found between the teachers from the Jewish sector and those from the Arab sector with reference to the study variables, and because this was the key research hypothesis, we decided to further examine whether there is a possible mediating variable in the connection between the sector and the three dependent variables. We decided to check whether age is a mediating variable in the relationship because apparently age is connected to part of the study's dependent variables and online learning technology is frequently perceived as more of a challenge for older people. In order to examine whether age possibly mediates connections between the sector and the study variables we used the PROCESS macro for SPSS (Hayes 2018) . This common, well-known and accepted macro enables the examination of mediation and moderation in a convenient and economical manner. By means of this supplement, age was found to mediate the relationship between sector and technological ability, where the interaction variable between sector and age was found to be significant in predicting technological ability b = \u2212 0.35, SE = 0.01, 95% CI [\u2212 0.06, \u2212 0.01]. The interpretation of the model reveals that for Jewish teachers, there is no statistically significant relationship between age and technological ability r = \u2212 0.01, df = 114, p = 0.98, whereas among the Arab teachers, this correlation is negative and statistically significant r = \u2212 0.33, df = 128, p < 0.001; we plotted the interaction in accordance with Aiken and West's technique (Aiken et al. 1991 ); see Fig. 1 . Students Table 5 shows the averages of the variables measured among the students, the Pearson correlations between them and their Cronbach's alpha internal reliability score. Selected demographic variables are also provided in the Table. As demonstrated, very strong positive and statistically significant correlations were found between technological abilities, attitudes towards studying online and success in studying online. We can also see in the Table that the Arab students request assistance less than others when they encounter difficulties in online learning. A weak but statistically significant positive correlation was found between attitudes towards online learning and requesting assistance. Thus, the more the student had greater positive attitudes towards online learning, the more he or she would ask for assistance from others when needed. Another weak and significant positive correlation was found between the grade and capability, where the higher the grade the greater the sense of technological ability reported by the students The research hypotheses presumed that a connection would be found between gender and grade level and the dependent variables: success in online studies, technological abilities, attitudes towards online learning and asking for help. Again, the hypotheses were examined by means of multivariate analysis that includes several dependent variables (Three-Way MANOVA). The grade variable was reduced to three categories: (1) grades three and four, (2) grades five and six, (3) grades 7-9. Thus, the model was 2 (male/female students \u00d7 2 (Jewish/Arab sector) \u00d7 3 (grades three and four, grades five and six, grades seven to nine), with four dependent variables (success, ability, attitudes and asking for help). A three-way interaction was found for the variable of requesting help F(1,465) = 5.24, p = 0.02. We did not find any three-way interaction for the success variable F(1,465) = 0.02, p = 0.88, the technological ability F(1,465) = 0.07, p = 0.80 or the attitudes towards online learning variable F(1,465) = 0.01, p = 0.93. In order to interpret the three-way interaction that was found, we decided to divide the sample into female and male students. A significant two-way interaction was found for the female students between the sector and grade, F(2,256) = 8.62, p < 0.001. In order to interpret the two-way interaction, we again divided the combined grade sample into the three grade categories. We found differences between Jewish female students and Arab female students only for the highergrade level (7th to 9th grades) regarding the requesting help variable. Thus, Jewish female students in these grades (n = 67) ask for help more (M = 2.98, SD = 0.76) than Arab female students (n = 78, M = 2.12, SD = 0.78), with statistical significance. In addition the findings show that among the Arab female students there are differences between the grade levels in reference to this variable F(2,280) = 3.98, p = 0.02. Scheffe's post hoc test determined that Arab female students in the 7th to 9th grades (n = 137) ask for help less (M = 2.13, SD = 0.86) than Arab female students in 5th and 6th grades (n = 78, M = 2.48, SD = 0.92) and Arab female students in 3rd and 4th grades (n = 68, M = 2.32, SD = 0.94). We did not find a two-way interaction between the sector and the grade level among the male students. Nonetheless, we did find a simple main effect for the sector F(1,256) = 10.38, p = 0.001, where the Jewish male students request assistance (n = 87, M = 2.67, SD = 0.81) more than the Arab male students (n = 127, M = 2.22, SD = 0.92), SN Soc Sci (2021) 1: 71 71 Page 14 of 23 without any connection to the grade level. In addition, the Jewish middle school students (n = 127) ask for help (M = 2.82, SD = 0.77) more than Arab middle school students (n = 137, M = 2.13, SD = 0.86): see Fig. 2 . Note: In 3rd and 4th grades, the number of Jewish male students was too low (5 > n) to calculate the average and thus they are not depicted in the figure.",

In accordance with the research hypotheses, older teachers were found to have lower technological abilities than the younger teachers and consequently teach online less.

The findings also show that male teachers have higher technological abilities than female teachers, beyond the sector and type of schools (elementary or middle school). Among the students, the higher grades and Jewish students were found to have higher technological abilities.

The gaps between teachers from the perspective of technological abilities are critical. The findings of this study indicate that teachers with lower levels of technological abilities tend to utilize the numerous possibilities less. Conceivably, these teachers do not make use of the different features available in the different online teaching systems. These findings correspond with the studies presented in the review of literature which found a negative correlation between the age of the teacher and the attitudes and the use of information technologies, namely technological abilities (Ganayem et al. 2009; Hung and Hsu 2007) . Consequently, it is not unfounded to presume that the quality of the instruction of teachers with lower technological abilities would be affected by the transition to online teaching. The problem becomes even greater when a certain sector, such as the Arab Sector in Israel (Ayalon et al. 2019 ) might be affected because the older (and in particular the female) teachers who teach according to this method have less technological abilities.",

Support for this finding can be found in an earlier study (Ganayem et al. 2009 ) which shows an advantage among younger generations over older generations in the use of technologies, as well as a digital divide that exists between the Arab society and the Jewish society (Ganayem 2018) . This has affected the integration of computerization in accordance with the national program for the computerization of the education system in the Arab sector, due to the lack of computer labs and training of teachers in the field of computers in the education system in this sector (Husny-Arar and Massry-Herzallah 2016). Nonetheless, seemingly there is room for optimism in light of the findings in this study indicating that this gap does not exist among the young teachers. The finding that male teachers have higher technological capabilities than female teachers is not surprising and corresponds with earlier studies (Masry-Herzallah and Amzalag 2019). Furthermore, it is well known that the scope of the use of the Internet as well as the diverse use of its contents is greater among men (Rafaeli et al. 2018) .",

            "text": "In the comparison between sector and type of school (elementary versus middle school) from the perspective of the scope of the use of online teaching, an interesting interaction was revealed. Namely, the findings do not reveal differences between Jewish and Arab teachers in the extent of the use of online teaching in middle schools. In contrast, Jewish teachers make more use of online teaching than Arab teachers in elementary school. The gaps found between some of the Jewish teachers and the Arab teachers can be explained by means of three factors. The first is at the level of the policy of the Ministry of Education, i.e. the main platforms of online teaching are in the Hebrew language and the majority of the contents designated for online teaching are in the Hebrew language; the second level, namely the technological ability of the teacher, is relatively lower among the Arab teachers in elementary schools, where the majority of the teachers are women. Furthermore, the digital divide between the male and female teachers as revealed in this study correspond with the finding revealed in earlier studies (Amzalag and Masry-Herzallah 2021) . Teachers in the education system and especially in elementary school, receive little or no training in online teaching, synchronous or asynchronous. Nonetheless, during the coronavirus crisis they were required to undergo the transition to SN Soc Sci (2021) online teaching with no prior preparation (Dahan et al. 2020) . The third factor we suggest originates at the student level. The lack of computers in the Arab families, the lack of infrastructure, the inability of the parents to assist their children with online learning serve as obstacles for teachers teaching online studies in elementary school and apparently to a lesser degree in higher levels of education. These findings correspond with the findings presented in earlier studies (Dynarski 2018; Reich et al. 2020) . It is possible that students in higher grades have more access to technological devices (mainly smartphones). Thus, the problem is greater among the younger students. Perhaps the lower level of access among the elementary school children in the Arab sector causes difficulties among them, which is connected to the lower use of online learning. The scarcity of online learning in elementary schools in the Arab sector, which in times of emergency is not only to teach, but also to provide emotional response to the students as well as a social-educational support framework, might affect the wellbeing of the students (Elias et al. 2019 ). In addition, it might widen the educational gaps between the strong students and the underprivileged students and the Jewish society and the Arab society.",

Specifically, the ability of the Arab parents to help their children apparently is lower due to the digital divide that exists also among the parents. For example, a much greater proportion of Jews are engaged in occupations that require computer knowledge (Central Bureau of Statistics 2020). Nonetheless, from the economic perspective, perhaps the enormous gaps in income between Jews and Arabs in favour of Jews (Central Bureau of Statistics 2020) result in less income that is available for tutoring among the Arab population. The findings in this study show that the Jewish students have more positive attitudes towards online learning than the Arab students. The Arab students' attitudes could stem from the fact that some of the Arab teachers have lower technological abilities than the Jewish teachers.",

Compulsory courses/lessons on skills in the digital space can be added to the curriculum for Arab students in primary school beginning in first grade, which would be taught by teachers qualified in the field in order to reduce the digital divide that exists between them and the Jewish students and train them in 21st century skills.",

First, the participants were recruited by means of a snowball convenience sample rather than a randomized subset of the population of interest. Furthermore, the data were provided through self-report questionnaires that may be confounded by bias reporting and common method variance. Nevertheless, in line with Podsakoff et al.'s (2000) recommendations, participants were explicitly assured of anonymity and were guaranteed that there were no right or wrong answers, thus reducing common method variance. This study is a correlative study that examined the system of relationships between the different variables. We do not know the direction of the relations; for instance, the direction of the relationship between technological abilities and asking for help is unclear. In addition, to better understand the phenomenon, future research should add narratives from study participants by means of a qualitative study. Furthermore, due to the fact that the study was conducted at the beginning of the coronavirus outbreak during the quarantine and the transition to online studies, the actual success rates of the students and teachers were not measured.",

The findings of this study can assist education policy makers in the education system in multicultural societies or in education systems serving ethnic minorities around the world, to reach conclusions about the characteristics of online learning during the Covid-19 pandemic and its effect on broadening the gaps between the different cultures.
