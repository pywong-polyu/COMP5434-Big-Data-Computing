A cross-sectional study was conducted through an online survey (N 0 = 3480; N 1 = 1041; N 2 = 569). The sense of belonging was evaluated by means of four Likert-type items. These questions included membership in different groups: work/studies, friends, family and neighborhood or community. Sociodemographic and COVID-19-related data were collected. Additionally, mental health, spiritual well-being, loneliness, social support and discrimination were assessed. Descriptive analyses were carried out and linear regression models compiled. The sense of belonging increased significantly during confinement, dropping dramatically with the start of the return to the ''new normality'' process. The only variable that showed interaction with time and sense of belonging was discrimination. Work condition (not working providing the lowest sense of belonging scores), social support from friends and loneliness were the main predictors of the sense of belonging. The impact caused by the pandemic and the actions adopted during the first weeks regarding the sense of belonging is evident. It has been a key variable in dealing with COVID-19. Actions are now needed to increase our sense of belonging to face the post-epidemic crisis and avoid a greater impact in other areas.",

Most countries had to declare a state of emergency, with physical distancing of the population being applied as the main measure. Spain was one of the countries hit the hardest by the pandemic when it reached Europe, leading the world in the number of infected people and people who died. At the beginning of July 2020, over 28,000 people had died and more than 250,000 people had been infected in Spain, making it the third country in Europe with the most cases (Health Ministry, Government of Spain, 2020).",

Most research points to the emergence of symptoms of anxiety, depression, sleep problems and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in a significant percentage of the population (Gonz\u00e1lez-Sanguino et al., 2020; Mazza et al., 2020; Tanoue et al., 2020; Voitsidis et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020a) . In addition, others have argued that if our identities are defined in a substantial part by the groups to which we belong (Tajfel et al., 1979) , our sense of self can be profoundly shaken when we are separated from these groups (Jetten et al., 2020) . As a consequence, the social isolation that results from lockdown policies can lead to loneliness (Fortgang, 2021) , with the need to maintain social connectedness (despite physical isolation) becoming a mandatory recommendation for mental health (Courtet et al., 2020) .",

In this way, this feeling can be essential when dealing with complicated situations or social and economic crises, as it is related to better psychological and social functioning (Hagerty et al., 1996) . The need to belong or sense of belonging (SB) has even been found to provide protection in the presence of depression and suicidal thoughts (McCallum et al., 2010; McLaren et al., 2009 ). According to this, SB has been previously associated to mental health (Hagerty et al., 1992) .",

These questions included membership in: work/study groups, friends, family and neighborhood or community. Lower scores indicate lower membership. The scales consistency is low (a = 0.58), as each element reflects a very different group belonging. \u2022 Social support was evaluated by the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (EMAS) adapted to Spanish (Landeta et al., 2002; Zimet et al., 1988) . The scale is made up of 12 Likert-type items with 7 possible responses (1 totally disagree to 7 totally agree), with the higher number being the more social support perceived. The EMAS explores three possible sources of perceived social support: family (4 items), friends (4 items) and relevant people (4 items) and also offers a full measure of social support. Cronbach's a for the Spanish version is 0.89. These characteristics are what recommended the use of this test over others also validated in Spanish (e.g., Gallardo-Peralta et al., 2021). \u2022 Loneliness was measured by the 3-item version of the UCLA Loneliness Scale (UCLA-3) in its Spanish version and self-applied (Russell, 1996; Velarde-Mayol et al., 2016) . The three items, in Likert format with three response options (1 rarely, 2 sometimes, 3 often), address three dimensions of loneliness: relational connection, social connection and self-perceived isolation. Cronbach's a for the Spanish version is 0.95. \u2022 Discrimination was evaluated by means of the Intersectional Day-to-Day Discrimination Index (InDI-D) (Scheim et al., 2019) , in its Spanish version. The translation was carried out by the authors of this study. This scale provides a measure of the intersectional discrimination that can be caused by different conditions: gender, ethnicity, mental health diagnosis and in this case, the presence of COVID-19 was also included. We used the main scale formed by 9 Likerttype items with four possible responses (1 never-4 often). The different questions evaluated the presence of intersectional discrimination from the beginning of the state of emergency caused by the coronavirus. The higher the score, the more discrimination suffered. For the Spanish version the scales consistency was adequate (a = 0.76).

            "text": "The results show the evolution of the SB throughout the COVID-19 crisis and when restrictions began to be lifted. The observed trend shows how during confinement the SB scores increased significantly and then decreased dramatically with the arrival of reopening and the beginning of the ''new normality.'' Considering SB as a facilitator for health (Begen et al., 2015; Hagerty et al., 1992) , this shows how during confinement to our homes and when the crisis situation was more acute and complicated, reaching out and relying on our communities was perhaps a strategy for coping with the situation. During the months of lockdown, several social changes could have perhaps increased the SB. The spokesperson for the Health Alert and Emergency Coordination Centre of the Ministry of Health appeared in daily press conferences. There were weekly appearances by the President of the Government, multiple television announcements providing information about the steps being taken to combat COVID-19 and announcements calling for unity. Citizens applauded from their balconies every day to thank the work of the health workers. They played the song ''I will resist'' constantly. Spontaneous community support networks sprang up, as well as the multiple posters hung in the windows painted with rainbows with the message ''Everything will be all right'' (or ''todo ira\u00b4bien'' in Spain and ''tutto andra`bene'' in Italy). However, as the country went from the acute crisis and began to return to the ''new normality,'' the SB scores dropped dramatically and even fell below the levels found in the first assessment. This may have been due to the climate of political tension in the country and pressure from social movements linked to extreme political parties that denied the existence of the crisis and the risks. Additionally, demonstrations were organized in the streets, the economic situation became worse (Nicola et al., 2020) and there were fewer and fewer of the actions mentioned above that initially seemed to unite the country in the most difficult moments (i.e., applause on the balconies). On the other hand, it must be taken into account that the sample studied was made up of a majority of women and people between the ages of 30 and 59 years, single and with university or postgraduate studies who were working at the time of the interview with a good evaluation of their economic level. It should also be noted that in relation to the COVID-19 most people had not had any symptoms or affected people close to them, feeling that the information they had received about the pandemic in general was good.",

            "text": "In this sense it should be noted that the results found could have been different if the sample had had different sociodemographic characteristics, such as groups with a worse socioeconomic situation where perhaps the SB could have increased to a lesser extent as they were less supported by the situation. Or people with symptoms or affected family members where perhaps there would have been greater isolation or even discrimination due to the illness, affecting their SB. All of the selected variables introduced showed significant associations with SB. However, the only variable that interacts over time was intersectional Discrimination. This opens the door to several possible interpretations that may need further research and discussion. Firstly, while SB decreases, discrimination maintains high. In the second wave the turning point occurs. This happens once we feel familiar with the situation we begin to withdraw from our SB and avoid people who belong to groups that can be potentially contagious. Specifically, at the beginning we all belong to the extended group of those who want to beat the virus and then we begin to differentiate between healthy people and those who could infect us (regardless of whether they are health workers, supermarket cashiers, truckers and so on). Secondly, this might also suggest that people feel more discriminated against during the hardest part of the pandemic and the more the person feels discriminated the less they feel they belong. Discrimination against certain health conditions is common, having also been recorded in previous pandemics, where infected or suspected persons, as well as health care workers, suffered from greater discrimination (Desclaux et al., 2017; DiGiovanni et al., 2004; Lee et al., 2005; Pellecchia et al., 2015; Reynolds et al., 2008; Wilken et al., 2017) .",

Wilcock (2006) argues that psychological and social well-being, as essential aspects in the current concept of health, are linked to the capacity of the human being to develop socially valued occupations. Thus, participation in occupations is essential for the human being. In her postulate (Wilcock, 2006) , the author defends what she calls the ''occupational nature of people'' at the same level as being social by nature. According to the American Occupational Therapy Association (AOTA, 2020), in order to provide a sense of well-being, there must be a balance between the occupational areas of self-care, work and leisure. Indeed, as Moruno-Miralles (2020) has stated, work can be considered as a significant occupation that allows the person to fulfill the social demands of his community of belonging and constitutes a way of giving meaning to existence and building one's personal, cultural and social identity. In our sample, work was clearly associated with SB and not having work affected SB negatively. This is consistent with McClure et al. (2008) , who already described the importance of belonging at work.",

Begen et al. (2015) found that acting to enhance belonging through inclusion resulted in adaptive physiological and psychological outcomes. Thus, to cope better with this crisis, it seems advisable that SB should be reinforced, possibly by finding a better balance between our other occupations, including the time we spend at work and with our friends and by combating the feelings of loneliness.",
