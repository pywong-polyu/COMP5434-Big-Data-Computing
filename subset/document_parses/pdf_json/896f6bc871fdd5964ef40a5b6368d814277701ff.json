            "text": "The ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and subsequent demand for viral testing has led to issues in scaling diagnostic lab efforts and in securing basic supplies for collection and processing of samples. This has motivated efforts by the scientific community to establish improved protocols that are more scalable, less resource intensive, and less expensive. One such developmental effort has resulted in an assay called \"Swab-Seq\", so named because it was originally developed to work with dry nasal swab samples. The existing gold standard test consists of RNA extracted from a nasopharyngeal (NP) swab that is subjected to quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Swab-Seq adapts this method to a next-generation sequencing readout. By pairing this modification with extraction-free sampling techniques, Swab-Seq achieves high scalability, low cost per sample, and a reasonable turnaround time. We evaluated the effectiveness of this assay in a community surveillance setting by testing samples collected from both symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals using the traditional NP swab. In addition, we evaluated extraction-free sampling techniques (both saliva and saline mouth gargle samples). We found the assay to be as clinically sensitive as the qRT-PCR assay, adaptable to multiple sample types, and able to easily accommodate hundreds of samples at a time. We thus provide independent validation of Swab-Seq and extend its utility regarding sample type and sample stability. Assays of this type greatly expand the possibility of routine, noninvasive, repeated testing of asymptomatic individuals suitable for current and potential future needs.",

            "text": "As the SARS-CoV-2 virus was transmitted across the world in late 2019 and early 2020, information about the virus spread almost as swiftly. While the initial cases were first reported outside of China on December 30 of 2019 1 , the full genome of the virus was deposited in GenBank by January 5 of 2020 (accession number MN908947 2 ). Impressively, by January 13, the World Health Organization (WHO) had already released a quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) assay, which was developed using portions of SARS-CoV-2 sequence that had previously been released to create a set of three different probe/primer pairs 3 . While many additional testing strategies have been developed, the most common sample collection workflow for testing for the presence of the virus involves a nasopharyngeal (NP) swab administered by a healthcare provider, placed in transport media and transferred to a diagnostic laboratory 4 . At that point, RNA is extracted from the media and used as a template for a qRT-PCR test. Several alternative sampling techniques have been tested 5 , however the Center for Disease Control (CDC) and WHO have listed NP swabs as the primary recommended sampling technique throughout the pandemic 6,7 . Nonetheless, the ideal sampling type remains unresolved 4,8-11 . Significantly increased demand for testing expanded rapidly throughout 2020, leading to worldwide shortages of many components necessary for this workflow. And these shortages in turn motivated many groups to implement alternative existing methods (e.g. Ref. 12 ) or to develop protocols that eliminated many of the standard steps (e.g. Refs. 4, [13] [14] [15] ). While various new assays have reported a wide range of times to return results, scalability, and sensitivity, many groups have emphasized that the most important feature of an assay is that it is sufficiently scalable to allow for repeated testing of asymptomatic populations 16-18 . One such assay, called \"Swab-Seq\", has been developed primarily by groups at UCLA and Octant Bio 14 . The Swab-Seq assay uses a set of primers targeting the S1 subunit of the Spike gene (though called \"S2\" primers), derived from Ref. 19 , and a spiked-in synthetic transcript of the same region that is added to each reaction at a fixed copy number for internal normalization across wells, which can be distinguished from the viral sequence on the basis of a 6 base pair (bp) barcode. After sequencing the amplified cDNA products, the readout of viral load is a log-transformed ratio of the number of viral RNA counts divided by the number of synthetic \"spikein\" transcript counts (\"S2/spike-in\" ratio). After developing the assay, the creators released a publicly available protocol under a so-called \"COVID license\" and established a Users Group to facilitate implementation of this and other protocols.",

We first evaluated the analytical sensitivity of the assay in our hands using contrived samples (i.e., samples to which synthetic viral RNA had been added), and then by leveraging samples collected as a part of ongoing studies at our campus testing facility, we explored the suitability of Swab-Seq for routine monitoring of asymptomatic populations by directly comparing Swab-Seq results with the results obtained using the traditional qRT-PCR assay on the same samples. In addition, we used Swab-Seq to test non-traditional sample types: saliva and saline gargle. We found that the assay was easy to implement, comparable to qRT-PCR in terms of clinical sensitivity in asymptomatic individuals (even in our non-CLIA setting), and that it is flexible to various sampling methods (including non-invasive and extraction-free sampling methods). Our results validate and extend recent method development 4,13-15 and demonstrate the potential for more streamlined workflows for viral testing in the current pandemic and in the future.",

            "text": "Swab-Seq, we initially performed a set of quality control experiments (Fig. 1A) . As in Ref. 14 , we used serial dilution of either synthetic viral RNA (Twist Biosciences) or heat-inactivated SARS-CoV-2 (ATCC) to establish the analytical sensitivity and linearity of the assay. With synthetic RNA, we estimated that the assay had a limit of detection (LOD) of approximately 10 copies of viral genome per reaction (equivalent to 2000 genomic copy equivalents or 'GCE' per mL of sample): 10 of 12 replicates were distinguishable from the negative controls at this viral load in our initial experiments with the AB TaqPath 1-step Multiplex Master Mix kit (blue dots in Fig. 1B ,C, see also Supplementary Fig. S1 , Supplementary Tables S1, S2), and an additional 12 of 12 replicates at this load were distinguishable from negatives regardless of whether we used synthetic RNA or inactivated viral particles in a subsequent experiment ( Supplementary Fig. S2 , Supplementary Table S3 ). While our estimates do not meet the FDA EUA threshold (requiring 19 of 20 replicates to be distinguishable at the LOD), we note that in two existing EUA approvals for Swab-Seq, the LOD was determined to be 125 GCE/mL 21 and 250 GCE/mL 22 . It is worth also noting that in both cases the applicants spiked-in viral particles before RNA extraction, which would effectively concentrate viral RNA. Therefore, our estimate of ~ 2000 GCE/mL represents an estimate of the LOD without concentrating the sample. We also confirmed that the assay works well with three different 1-step qRT-PCR kits: NEB Luna and two different formulations of AB TaqPath (Fig. 1B,C, Supplementary Fig. S1 , Supplementary Tables S1, S2), partially overlapping the kits used in Ref. 14 . In contrast to the Luna kit, the TaqPath kits contain Uracil-N-glycosylase (UNG), which helps to eliminate contamination from previously carried-over PCR products. Therefore, we used one of the TaqPath qRT-PCR kits, the TaqPath 1-step Multiplex Master Mix kit, for most experiments.",

To assess the feasibility of community surveillance with Swab-Seq, we tested four 96-well plates of samples that included 257 RNA samples extracted from NP swabs and 127 control wells (controls further explained in \"Methods\"). The samples represented on these plates were originally collected from two groups-a group of 81 symptomatic individuals and a group of 176 asymptomatic individuals.

            "text": "Upon testing with Swab-Seq (Fig. 2, Supplementary Fig. S3 , Supplementary Table S4) , three subject samples (and one control sample) did not meet our threshold for sequencing depth (> 500 reads mapped to S2 and the spike-in control combined) and were considered inconclusive by Swab-Seq. We found that qRT-PCR Ct values for N1 and the Swab-Seq Log 10 -transformed S2/Spike-in ratios were highly correlated (Pearson's r = \u2212 0.96 for the 61 samples detectable by both methods, p-value = 1.0 \u00d7 10 -34 ). The correlation was particularly evident in the range of ~ 20 < Ct < ~ 40 (Fig. 2C ), although Swab-Seq appears to show some saturation at very high viral load. Reassuringly, Ct values for RPP30 (human control gene) were not correlated with the log-transformed Swab-Seq ratio (Pearson's r = \u2212 0.04, p-value = 0.5, Supplementary Fig. S3E ). The correlation of RPP30 levels from the Swab-Seq assay with the qRT-PCR Ct values of RPP30 was initially low for samples as well (Pearson's r = \u2212 0.46, p-value = 1.0 \u00d7 10 -13 , Supplementary Fig. S3F ). However, this rose substantially after we filtered out samples with such high viral loads that they suppressed the spike-in control counts that we utilized as a normalizing factor in the Swab-Seq method (Pearson's r = 0.73, p-value = 3.2 \u00d7 10 -35 after excluding 34 samples with < 600 spike-in control reads, Supplementary Fig. S3G ). In addition, we observed no evidence of plate effects influencing the correlation between qRT-PCR and Swab-Seq ( Supplementary Fig. S4 ). Importantly, Swab-Seq had a positive % agreement of 94% (61/65) with N1 qRT-PCR (95% CI 85.2-97.6%; Fig. 2F ), higher than the N2 qRT-PCR primer set. The negative % agreement was 96.4% (95% CI 92.7-98.2%). The \u03ba coefficient was 0.89 (95% CI 0.83-0.95). Swab-Seq also detected viral RNA in both of the S2-positive control wells. Among 124 negative control wells (including four that contain N control sequence but not S2), Swab-Seq gave a positive result for four, with three of the four having been positive in the N1 qRT-PCR assay as well, thus suggesting a false positive rate for Swab-Seq of 0.8% (1/121). While this initial test was performed with 40 cycles for Swab-Seq (\"Swab-Seq40\" from here on), we noted that 50 cycles (\"Swab-Seq50\") had been used in some instances in Ref. 14 , purportedly for better sensitivity. To test this directly, we re-processed all of the samples using Swab-Seq50 ( Fig. 2A,D, Supplementary Fig. S5A , Supplementary Table S5 ). Three of the subject samples and four of the negative controls did not meet our threshold for combined S2 and spike-in reads (> 500 reads combined) this time as well. Comparing Swab-Seq50 and qRT-PCR, the positive % agreement was 90.8% (95% CI 81.3-95.7%; Fig. 2G ), with a Pearson's r = \u2212 0.95 (p-value = 3.9 \u00d7 10 -31 ) for samples positive by both assays (Fig. 2D) . Interestingly, the negative % agreement decreased from 96.4% for Swab-Seq40 to 93.2% (95% CI 88.8-96.0%), which could indicate either that Swab-Seq50 is more able to identify true positives or that it is more prone to false positives. The \u03ba coefficient was 0.81 (95% CI 0.73-0.89). Comparing the two Swab-Seq tests directly, the Pearson's r was 0.98 (p-value = 5.2 \u00d7 10 -40 ) for subject samples positive by both, and Swab-Seq50 detected 88% (57/65) of the samples detected as positive with Swab-Seq40. It was www.nature.com/scientificreports/ also apparent that the S2/Spike-in ratio values were lower for negative samples and higher for positive samples with Swab-Seq50 than with Swab-Seq40 ( Supplementary Fig. S5B ), indicative of a likely true gain in sensitivity. Swab-Seq40 identified eight positives that were not corroborated by Swab-Seq50 (four of which were also positive by N1 qRT-PCR), while Swab-Seq50 identified 12 that were not detected with Swab-Seq40 (two of which were also N1 qRT-PCR positive). The two positive controls containing S2 sequences were detected as positive by Swab-Seq50 (as they had been by Swab-Seq40). However, 11 of the negative control samples were detected as positive in the Swab-Seq50 assay (three of which were also detected by qRT-PCR), suggesting a potential false positive rate as high as 6.8% (8/118). We interpret these data to suggest that in some cases Swab-Seq50 missed true positives and included false positives, while the general trend seems to be that Swab-Seq50 overall is able to detect more positives (Fig. 2, Supplementary Fig. S5B ).",

In this experiment, we included both 96-and 384-well plates to evaluate scalability. We found that the assay was sensitive down to ~ 10-50 copies/reaction (4000-20,000 copies/mL in saliva before dilution, Fig. 3A , Supplementary Fig. S6 , Supplementary Table S6) in both formats. To further explore important variables in this assay, we tested three major comparisons in a single experiment: (1) the amount of time the samples were heated (the original publication of the saliva conditions indicated that 30 min at 95 \u00b0C was required for best qRT-PCR efficiency 13 ), (2) the performance of both TaqPath enzymes in this more challenging scenario (i.e. in the presence of saliva), and (3) the number of cycles of amplification (in the original Swab-Seq manuscript, the authors Table S7 ), we observed a major improvement in the performance of negative controls for 50 cycles relative to 40 cycles (Fig. 3B ).",

            "text": "While the saliva results are promising, there are challenges to working with saliva-including variable viscosity and variable volume obtained, as well as some anecdotal reticence on the part of individuals to the idea of spitting into a tube. This adds difficulty to designing scalable, automated solutions for sample handling (although the authors of the original Swab-Seq manuscript present one potential approach 14 ). An alternative method recently developed and implemented at our university is the use of saline gargle. In this protocol subjects are given a 5 mL bolus of saline that they gargle in the back of their mouth for a short period of time before depositing the solution into a collection tube. This method reduces the issue of viscosity and helps to normalize the volume obtained from each individual, although at the cost of substantially diluting the virus. On the basis of the listed advantages, our university recently implemented saline gargle as a standard testing practice. To evaluate this collection method with Swab-Seq50, we first performed a serial dilution of inactivated virus, as we had done with other sample types. While the original saliva protocol tested a range of heat inactivation times and temperatures and found incubation of the sample at 95 \u00b0C for 30 min to be optimal for detection of the virus, the gargle protocol was initially implemented with a 65 \u00b0C for 30 min inactivation. To evaluate this in the context of Swab-Seq50, we tested 65 \u00b0C for 30 min and 95 \u00b0C for 10, 20, or 30 min in a single experiment ( Supplementary Fig. S8 , Supplementary Table S8 ). In contrast to the original report for saliva (assessed at 100 copies per reaction) 13 , 65 \u00b0C for 30 min appeared equivalent to 95 \u00b0C for 10, 20, or 30 min down to 100 copies per reaction. With concentrations at or below 50 copies per reaction, the data for samples at 95 \u00b0C suggest some potential degradation of detectable virus. Since this gargle protocol was already implemented in our campus community for routine testing, we were also able to test gargle samples from some asymptomatic infected individuals. For this experiment, we tested 17 qRT-PCR-positive samples and 20 qRT-PCR-negative samples with Swab-Seq50 in duplicate. Comparing Ct values from the CDC-designed qRT-PCR assay to Swab-Seq50, we found that all 17 positive samples were detected with Swab-Seq50 in both replicate sets (Fig. 4A,B, Supplementary Table S9 ) and that one sample from the negative pool also appeared to be positive via Swab-Seq50 (Fig. 4C) . Correlation for qRT-PCR with the Swab-seq50 positive samples yielded a Pearson's r = \u2212 0.75 (p-value = 5.4 \u00d7 10 -4 ) and \u2212 0.81 (p-value = 1.0 \u00d7 10 -4 ) for replicate sets 1 and 2, respectively. The positive % agreement was 100% (95% CI 81.6-100.0%, Fig. 4D ,E) between qRT-PCR and each Swab-Seq50 replicate, and the negative % agreement was 95% (95% CI 76.4-99.1%). The \u03ba coefficient between both replicates and qRT-PCR was 0.95 (95% CI 0.84-1.00). Comparing Swab-seq50 replicates with each other, the Pearson's r was 0.97 (p-value = 2.2 \u00d7 10 -12 ), the positive % agreement was 100% (95% CI 82.4-100.0%, Fig. 4F ), the negative % agreement was 100% (95% CI 83.2-100.0%), and the \u03ba coefficient was 1.00 (95% CI: N/A). Although Swab-Seq only identified one additional positive sample, these results raise the possibility that Swab-Seq50 may be better able to detect positives than qRT-PCR for the routine surveillance of communities using a saline gargle protocol. www.nature.com/scientificreports/ SARS-CoV-2 in oral sampling methods is stable and compatible with Swab-seq. The fact that detectable SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA is reported to be very stable in saliva 26, 27 potentially allows for flexibility in the collection of samples for such an assay (including at-home collection and drop-off of samples). Therefore, we sought to confirm that Swab-Seq50 was able to detect virus in samples stored for extended periods at \u2212 20 \u00b0C or at room temperature (Fig. 5A ). These temperatures were chosen to represent the extremes at which diagnostic labs might consider storing samples. To test stability of the (heat-inactivated) virus, a time course experiment was set up by collecting saliva and saline gargle samples from three (virus-negative) subjects. We then spiked in heat-inactivated virus at a concentration 100 copies per \u03bcL for saliva and 50 copies per \u03bcL for saline gargle (the difference in concentration was to account for the subsequent TBE/Tween-20 dilution step in the saliva protocol). Samples were stored at either \u2212 20 \u00b0C or at room temperature for up to one week. The samples were then heated for 30 min (95 \u00b0C for saliva, 65 \u00b0C for saline gargle), saliva samples (not gargle samples) were diluted with TBE plus Tween-20, all samples were frozen, and then all were assayed as a complete set at the end of the time course. Consistent with previous reports in saliva 15, 27 , the virus appeared to be highly stable at both storage temperatures for either sample collection type ( Fig. 5B -E, Supplementary Table S10). In order to evaluate this relationship statistically, we used a likelihood-ratio testing framework (see \"Methods\" for details) to determine if storage duration had a significant impact on viral abundance in any of the four conditions considered here. We did not find a significant effect for any of the conditions over the 7-day time course (p-values: saliva at \u2212 20 \u00b0C = 0.52; saliva at RT = 0.99; gargle at \u2212 20 \u00b0C = 0.09; gargle at RT = 0.65). However, saline gargle samples exhibited a compressed S2/Spike-in ratio (which we interpret as indicative of PCR inhibition). Nonetheless, viral particles were stably detectable across individuals and storage conditions.",

            "text": "In this study we evaluated the sensitivity, scalability, and flexibility of Swab-Seq as a potential assay for community surveillance of SARS-CoV-2. We found that the analytical sensitivity of the assay was ~ 10 copies per reaction in our research setting, and (consistent with previous results 14, 21, 22 ) is likely even more sensitive in a CLIA setting. The assay is compatible with several enzyme kits and sample types, including RNA extracted from swabs and (unextracted) saliva and saline gargle samples. Saliva and saline gargle sample collection methods are particularly promising, as they require relatively little equipment or expertise for collection, are stable for at least a week at room temperature, and can be used as templates with minimal pre-processing. In our testing, saliva appears to have a lower limit of detection than the gargle, likely due to both the dilution factor and PCR inhibition effects of the saline solution used in the gargle. However, one limitation of our study is that all of our tests involving www.nature.com/scientificreports/ saliva were conducted with spiked-in viral particles, unlike our experiments with swabs and saline gargle for which samples from study subjects were available to evaluate clinical sensitivity and specificity. Future work will be required to compare saliva and saline gargle samples directly to NP swab samples from the same subjects. There are several caveats to these results. First, while Swab-Seq50 does appear in general to be more analytically sensitive than Swab-Seq40 in head-to-head comparisons, it also appears to be susceptible to both false negatives and false positives (predominantly among samples near the limit of detection). We suspect this could be explained by PCR amplification biases 28 , though we have not evaluated this directly. Second, while the assay is fairly streamlined-implementing extraction-free sample collection methods, and sequencing as short as possible-this method does not represent a rapid diagnostic. All things considered, we expect that it is possible to process samples at approximately the same rate as the qRT-PCR standard in a diagnostic lab setting. Swab-Seq has the advantage that it can be scaled with more barcoded primers and more standard thermal cyclers, whereas the qRT-PCR assay requires additional (expensive) real-time thermal cyclers. However, Swab-Seq also requires access to an Illumina sequencer. In addition, as detailed in previous publications 14, 29 , Swab-Seq is susceptible to a phenomenon called \"barcode swapping\", in which residual primers are incorporated into PCR products on the sequencer after pooling samples and thereby can swap out the correct barcode for an erroneous one. In www.nature.com/scientificreports/ the experiments where we used unique dual indices (UDI), and were therefore best powered to detect barcode swapping, the percentage of reads that matched individual barcodes but represented invalid pairs of barcodes ranged from 0.03% on a NextSeq sequencer to 2% on a MiSeq sequencer (Supplementary Table S11 ). While the NextSeq data showed a lower swapping rate, these samples were also pooled with other libraries, which serves to both dilute the concentration of carried over primers and dilute the concentration of target amplicons from the same library (relative to amplicons from other libraries). Finally, we have emphasized the use of extractionfree methods for processing samples. These have important advantages, including limited handling of potentially infectious samples, long-term stability at room temperature, speed in processing, and scalability. However, extracting RNA both concentrates the sample and removes background contaminants that can inhibit PCR. We observe a particular reduction in the limit of detection in saline gargle relative to saliva and extracted RNA, even though this sample type is the most amenable to scaled processing. Nonetheless, in our view the advantages of Swab-Seq warrant its use in facilitating a response to the current pandemic and future ones. Looking forward, it is our position that Swab-Seq (and assays like it) would benefit from further development of several modifications for even greater applicability and precision. First, multiplexing the assay would potentially improve the sensitivity and enable simultaneous testing for multiple viruses. This would help to both combat the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and to enable more routine testing for seasonal viruses. Second, the issues with barcode swapping present a major challenge. Proposed solutions include the use of UDI where every well sequenced together receives a unique index on each end of the amplicon. This makes the identification of barcode swapping unambiguous, but does not scale well-profiling 384 samples requires 1536 unique primers. A second option is to use so-called \"semi-combinatorial\" indexing, whereby not all combinations of primers are implemented. Instead, several sets of independent primers may be used in a combinatorial fashion (e.g. one set used for each quadrant of a plate). This increases the overall diversity of barcodes relative to combinatorial indexing and also increases the number of combinations that are invalid, allowing for better exclusion of some swapping events. However, this leaves some barcode swapping undetectable and still has issues with scaling-splitting 384 into four groups that each received independent combinations would still require 160 primers. A third solution would be to introduce a unique molecular index (UMI) into the library design. This degenerate sequence would be introduced during reverse transcription and would uniquely tag each RNA molecule profiled. Through PCR amplification, proper UMIs would be copied in large quantities. Barcode swapping occurring later on the sequencing instrument, would result in a rare pairing of a UMI and a barcode combination that should be easy to detect and exclude. There are challenges in implementing a UMI in the current 1-step qRT-PCR workflow, but we think this would be an important future improvement. In addition, if the library construction design incorporated a third level of barcoding, 384 samples could reasonably be profiled by 48 primers in one configuration.",

Gargle samples with viral particles spiked in were heated at 65 \u00b0C for 30 min or 95 \u00b0C for 10-30 min, depending on the experiment, and then placed on ice until the next step.",

For sequencing, the purified library was freshly diluted to 2 nM with EB buffer, and then 10 \u03bcL of the library was denatured with 10 \u03bcL of 0.1 N NaOH by incubating for 5 min at room temperature. The addition of 980 \u03bcL of HT1 buffer (Illumina) stopped the denaturation and diluted the library to 20 pM. The PhiX (Illumina) control (when Swab-Seq was not pooled with other sample types) was also prepared at 20 pM in the same way, and both the denatured library (60%) and the PhiX control (40%) were mixed in these instances. Libraries were then further diluted to 8 pM (MiSeq v2 kit), 15 pM (MiSeq v3 kit), or 1.5 pM (NextSeq Mid kit) with HT1 buffer. Custom primers for Read1 and Index1(also called \"i7\") (and Index2 (also called \"i5\"), if sequencing on a NextSeq) were spiked into the standard primer reservoirs. For the MiSeq, 100 \u03bcL of the primer mixture in reservoir 12 was mixed with 6.8 \u03bcL of the custom Read1 primer mixture (50 \u00b5M of each primer for S2 and RPP30) and then replaced in reservoir 12 of the MiSeq reagent cartridge. The i7 primer mixture for S2 and RPP30 was loaded into reservoir 13 with the same method. For the NextSeq 500/550, 52 \u03bcL of the Read1 primer mixture (each primer at a final concentration of 10 uM) was loaded into reservoir 22. In addition, 85 \u03bcL of the i7 primer mixture (10 \u03bcM for each primer) and 85 \u03bcL of the i5 primer mixture (10 \u00b5M for each primer) were loaded into reservoir 23. Unless accommodating for other library types on the same run, sequencers were run with 26 cycles of read 1 and 10 cycles of each index. See Supplementary Table S11 for a summary of the sequencing results. Note that we re-sequenced one sample, \"Saliva_dilutions_96_vs_384\", three times due to low clustering on the sequencer. Here we have combined all three runs for analysis. www.nature.com/scientificreports/ After generating a data matrix that provides read counts for each transcript assigned to each sample barcode, we calculated S2/Spike-in ratios and visualized data in R by modifying scripts from the Octant Github repository. We provide our scripts for data processing and visualization as a Github repository (https:// github. com/ cusan ovich lab/ swabs eq). For samples collected from asymptomatic individuals (both extracted RNA and saline gargle), we obtained Ct values as the average of three qRT-PCR replicates from the parent study. We considered any sample with a detectable Ct value positive. For Swab-Seq40, we set the S2/Spike-in ratio positive samples at 0.01. For Swab-Seq50, we set the threshold at 0.002. All titration and stability experiments were conducted with combinatorial barcodes, such that each well of each plate received a unique combination of i5 and i7 barcodes and all samples were included in downstream analyses regardless of sequencing depth. All experiments involving subject samples were conducted with UDI, meaning that every well received a unique i5 barcode and a unique i7 barcode. These UDI primers were kindly provided by Octant Bio. Only samples with at least 500 reads mapping to either S2 or the spike-in control were considered in downstream analyses for experiments with subject samples. While Ct values represented the average of triplicates, S2/Spike-in ratio values were determined without replicates.",

BCL files from the sequencers were converted to fastq files locally on a personal computer using Illumina's bcl2fastq program implemented as a Docker image from (https:// hub. docker. com/r/ genom icpar iscen tre/ bcl2f astq2). Because some samples were multiplexed with other experiments, we developed a custom python script to demultiplex fastq files on the basis of expected barcodes while accounting for other barcodes that were sequenced on the same run and allowing for a hamming distance of 1 between sequenced barcodes and expected/possible barcodes. For consistency, even experiments sequenced alone were demultiplexed with this pipeline. The demultiplexing script is available from our github repository (https:// github. com/ cusan ovich lab/ swabs eq). Plate maps were generated and then converted into sample sheets using the code available from Octant Bio's github repository (https:// github. com/ octan tbio/ SwabS eq). Metadata files and whitelists of barcodes were generated using a previously published preprocessing method 29 (outlined in a Jupyter notebook for Swab-Seq analysis https:// github. com/ pacht erlab/ BLCSB GLKP_ 2020/ blob/ master/ noteb ooks/ swabs eq. ipynb). Fastq files were then mapped to a custom reference that included the S2, spike-in control, and RPP30 sequences and summed by sample barcode using the \"Swabseq10\" command available on the \"covid\" branch of the kallisto Github repository (https:// github. com/ pacht erlab/ kalli sto. git) as well as bustools 30, 31 .
