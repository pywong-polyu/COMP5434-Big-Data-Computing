            "text": "Food allergy, defined as \"a potentially life-threatening immunological response that occurs reproducibly upon ingestion of the allergen,\" [1] is a public health concern that directly affects 4-10% of the population [2] . The condition also affects their families, communities, and society at large. Whereas the pathogenesis and natural history of food allergy [2] , and most recently, methods to induce clinical tolerance [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] , have been extensively studied, the associated economic burden and its drivers remain only partially understood, yet food allergy requires dietary modifications, avoidance of the allergenic foods in most forms, and constant possession of adrenaline autoinjectors (AAI). The costs associated with the management of food allergy are widely considered to be substantial, albeit highly variable by country and, occasionally, by jurisdiction. The pivotal findings from \"Learning Early About Peanut Allergy\" (LEAP) [9] in the United Kingdom (UK) and HealthNuts in Australia [10] shifted primary prevention guidelines worldwide from avoidance to early introduction [11, 12] . Ongoing immunotherapy research includes an ultimate goal of achieving sustained unresponsiveness [3] . Few studies, to date, have considered the overall economic benefits and willingness-to-pay (WTP) by health systems and end users, yet many individuals with food allergy continue to bare psychological and financial consequences of the condition. Recent reviews have elegantly described the former [13] [14] [15] [16] ; however, fewer studies have focused on the econonomic consequences of the condition. Herein, we aimed to summarise the existing evidence on the economic burden of food allergy to both society and patients and identify what remains unknown. Guided by the PRISMA guidelines for Scoping Reviews [17] , included articles were synthesized thematically, followed by a discussion on knowledge gaps. All costs reported herein have been converted to Euros (\u20ac; exchange rate 9 March 2022).",

The total US cost was estimated at \u20ac22.8 billion annually (\u20ac3,849/year/child) [19] . Costs to the medical system accounted for \u20ac4.0 billion of the total cost, while the cost borne by families (i.e., direct out-ofpocket and opportunity costs) amounted to \u20ac18.9 billion. Of the direct-outof-pocket costs borne by families, 31% were related to the additional cost of foods. Caregivers reported a WTP (i.e. the maximum amount willing to be paid for a product or service) of \u20ac3,224/year/child for food allergy treatment [19] . Scott et al. (2019) also examined the healthcare costs of food allergy but limited their focus to patients with peanut allergy [20] . In this study, patients were matched to two control cohorts: one based on age and sex (i.e., simplematched) and the other based on the presence of an atopic comorbidity. Using this method, Scott and colleagues found the total annual incremental healthcare costs associated with peanut allergy were \u20ac304 (atopy-matched) and \u20ac400 (age/sex-matched) per person. Patients with a history of anaphylaxis and those prescribed an AAI had additional incremental costs of \u20ac794 (vs. no anaphylaxis) and \u20ac470 (vs. no AAI), respectively. When extrapolated to the UK population, total excess costs of peanut allergy ranged from \u20ac40-53 million/year [20] .",

A Markov model was used to compare the cost-effectiveness of various approaches of introducing peanut (i.e., early introduction of peanut without screening; screening with allergist referral and peanut SPT; and primary care peanut-specific serum IgE screening with referral for positive cases) amongst high-risk (classified as severe eczema and/or egg allergy) and lowrisk children. A strategy of early introduction of peanut without screening in both high and low-risk groups was economically preferable, providing both clinical and cost benefits compared to screening methods. Significant costeffectiveness was also shown with any strategy compared to delayed peanut introduction. For high-risk children, when compared to no-screening, the incremental cost to prevent a single peanut-allergic reaction was \u20ac18,762 by SPT and \u20ac65,338 by sIgE screening. Furthermore, the cost of preventing a single peanut-allergic reaction beyond exclusively urticaria was \u20ac95,646 by SPT. SPT screening led to a false-positive result in approximately 3.4% of all identified peanut allergy cases [24\u2022] . Further sensitivity analysis showed that the cost-effectiveness of this approach is unlikely but plausible if the negative quality of life (QoL) impact of an at-home vs. in-clinic reaction was high, or when peanut allergy prevalence was as high as 36% [25] . Even in cases of infants with a peanut-allergic sibling, an approach of at-home peanut introduction without screening was more cost-effective than a SPT screening strategy [26] .",

The incremental cost of identifying a positive egg allergy patient through SPT was \u20ac2,005 (\u20ac6,034, including indirect costs). Of note, primary care screening through egg sIgE (followed by avoidance in infants testing positive) was the most expensive strategy and resulted in the most incremental cases of egg allergy. When using raw pasteurized egg for early egg introduction, the preferred cost-effective strategy shifted to delayed introduction. This was due to the high reaction rate reported in at-risk infants to early introduction of raw egg. However, with the use of cooked egg, modelling of Canadian and European data also demonstrated a no-screening approach prior to early introduction was the most cost-effective [27] .",

Future research is warranted in terms of barriers and knowledge translation (particularly for groups with lower health literacy and language barriers) and perhaps most importantly, if early introduction does, in fact, decrease food allergy prevalence.

Using published clinical outcomes and resource utilisation estimates, Guest and Valovirta estimated the economic impact of tightening of public reimbursement guidelines for eHF and AAF in Finland. Through their modelling, they predicted a significant increase in healthcare resource use, including a 10% increase in the number of specialist visits over 6 months and a 12% increase in public health spending (i.e., \u20ac889,389 to \u20ac992,761) [32] . Of this cost, only 3-5% was associated with formulas. Australian researchers focused on CMPA management and its associated costs, finding variability in the formula prescribing practices of paediatricians, paediatric gastroenterologists, and paediatric allergists, including divergence from existing guidelines [33] . The authors also estimated that prescribed formulas account for 62% of the total 6 monthly cost to the healthcare system, with clinician visits accounting for 28%. Furthermore, despite additional costs of \u20ac4.4 million to \u20ac4.7 million (over 6 months), using AAF as the initial treatment for CMPA would reduce clinician consultations from approximately 10,400 to 6,100-7,100 and potentially release limited paediatric specialist resources for alternative use [33] .",

In the US, since 2012, all AAIs are exclusively dispensed as twin-packs, whereas in the UK, 2 AAIs are prescribed to all patients [50\u2022, 51] . Shaker et al. (2017) noted significant variation in costs of AAIs throughout US pharmacies, with prices between brands ranging from \u20ac143 to \u20ac682 per twin-pack [52] . If two twin-packs were prescribed a year, the additional expenditure between AAIs could amount to \u20ac11,570/reaction treated over a 2-year period. Shaker and Greenhawt (2018) undertook a cost-effectiveness model to define a value-based pricing of stock AAIs [53]. Costs were evaluated from a societal perspective comparing children with peanut allergy prescribed AAIs vs. those without prescribed adrenaline. Over the 80-year modelling, the total cost of anaphylaxis preparedness and treatment in those with vs. without prescribed AAIs was \u20ac23,440 vs. \u20ac602, respectively. The average food allergy fatality per patient prescribed vs. not prescribed an AAI was 0.00056 compared to 0.00148, respectively. The value-based price for personal epinephrine based on a tenfold fatality risk increase was \u20ac22, and at a 100-fold hypothetical fatality risk was \u20ac243. If the model assumed a 100% carriage and appropriate use compliance rate for when treatment was indicated, the cost ceiling of personal adrenaline was slightly higher (\u20ac33 at tenfold fatality risk). In addition, when considering both the increased hospitalization and fatality risks, the value-based price for personal epinephrine ceiling was \u20ac30 (or \u20ac46, assuming universal carriage and appropriate use of device) [54] .",

Pre-emptive adrenaline use, followed by emergency medical service activation and care cost an additional \u20ac1098/patient over the 20-year modeled period. The incremental cost/life-year saved was \u20ac10,746,980 for early precautionary epinephrine use without symptoms (\u20ac101,449,154/death prevented), but even at a 1000-fold increased risk of waiting for symptoms to emerge, pre-emptive costs were significantly greater than cost-effectiveness cut-offs. Rather than immediately contacting emergency services following adrenaline use, a study by Shaker et al. (2018) evaluated the costeffectiveness of watchful waiting and only activating emergency services if initial symptoms of the reaction do not promptly resolve after treatment [57] . They assumed a tenfold increased fatality risk with delayed emergency service activation. There was a minimal change in per-patient fatality rate of 0.0000012 vs. 0.0000019 for wait and see. The incremental cost per life-year saved was \u20ac131,507,971 for early emergency service activation compared to wait and see (costing > \u20ac1 billion/death prevented).

Out-of-pocket costs range dramatically, costs range significantly by country, as do prescribing practices. For example, in Australia, often AAIs are only prescribed to high-risk individuals or those with previous anaphylaxis. This initial prescription is limited also to emergency department physicians and allergists/immunologists. With such varied AAI prescribing, it is not possible to extrapolate the results of Shaker et al. [50\u2022 ] beyond this population. These differences in prescribing practices vary by country, and may thus alter cost-effectiveness.

Amongst children aged 0-12 years, total household costs were also comparable; however, differences in direct costs were found, which were largely driven by costs associated with medical care [64]. In contrast, in Canada, despite comparable total annual household costs, allergic cases had greater overall direct costs compared to controls (\u20ac8,845 vs. \u20ac7,156), largely due to food costs and to a lesser extent, travel to medical appointments and medications [67] .

An initial cost-effectiveness study on peanut oral immunotherapy (POIT) was modeled based on a study by Tang et al. [76] , randomising hypothetical subjects to POIT with a probiotic or avoidance of peanut [73] . From a US perspective, costs were comprised of desensitisation materials, supervised challenge visits, and costs of healthcare visits and treatment. Overall, POIT was shown to be cost-effective when compared to simple avoidance with an incremental cost-effective ratio (ICER) of \u20ac1,971/QALY. POIT resulted in an improvement of 1.15 QALYs with an additional cost of \u20ac2,266 over the 20-year modeled time horizon. A mean number of 12.3 and 2.0 allergic reactions occurred in the POIT groups and avoidance groups, respectively, over the 20 years, with 2.3 episodes of anaphylaxis treated with intramuscular adrenaline per subject in the POIT group compared to 1.1 episodes in the avoidance group. This cost-effectiveness was maintained following sensitivity analysis including, with or without grocery costs, with increased rates of spontaneous tolerance, accounting for accidental peanut exposure rates of 5-30%/year, changing QoL improvement and higher reaction rates from peanut oral immunotherapy. Although overall QoL improved with POIT, allergic symptoms and episodes of anaphylaxis were higher [54, 74\u2022\u2022] .",

The authors used Markov modelling and a cost-effectiveness analysis to compare these two proposed therapies to no immunotherapy. Over the 80-year modelling, EPIT was associated with lower costs compared to POIT (mean \u20ac142,289 vs. \u20ac150,442) with fewer total episodes of anaphylaxis (mean 1.33 vs. 3.83) and fewer episodes of therapy-associated anaphylaxis (mean 0.62 vs. 3.10). Assuming an annual cost of therapy of \u20ac3,532 for caregivers' WTP [19] , neither therapy was cost-effective (EPIT ICER of \u20ac198,776 and POIT ICER of \u20ac234,997). When evaluating a value-based cost analysis (WTP of US$100,000/ QALY), the annual cost of each therapy could not exceed \u20ac1,443 (EPIT) and \u20ac1,136 (POIT) inclusive of clinician visits to be cost-effective. Using sensitivity analysis and if health-related QoL reached 98% with therapy, the maximum value-based therapy costs would be \u20ac6,043 (EPIT) and \u20ac4,816 (POIT). The three largest determinants of cost-effectiveness and value of each peanut therapy were improving health-related QoL with therapy, reducing the risk of anaphylaxis, and increasing the likelihood of achieving sustained unresponsiveness.",

Rates of food insecurity, independent of food allergy, have similarly increased dramatically across the world [83] [84] [85] , and are likely to remain high for the foreseeable future owing to increased food costs. Within the food allergy community, food insecurity is thought to be more prevalent than in the general population, yet food banks are often underequipped to accommodate medical dietary restrictions, including food allergy. Discussions about food insecurity may be warranted for some patients and families, yet only 25% of clinicians routinely screen patients [86] . Similarly, greater emphasis on the burden of direct and indirect costs by income level is warranted to most effectively allocate resources and implement policy.",
