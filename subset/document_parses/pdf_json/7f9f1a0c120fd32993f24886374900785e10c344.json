            "text": "Importance: Acute necrotizing encephalopathy (ANE) is a rare disease with high mortality. Plasma exchange (PLEX) has recently been reported to treat ANE of childhood (ANEC), but its efficacy is uncertain. Objective: This study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of PLEX on ANEC. Methods: A retrospective study was conducted in four pediatric intensive care units from December 2014 to December 2020. All patients who were diagnosed with ANEC were included; however, these patients were excluded if their length of stay was less than 24 h. Participants were classified into PLEX and non-PLEX groups. Results: Twenty-nine patients with ANEC were identified, 10 in the PLEX group and 19 in the non-PLEX group. In the PLEX group, C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, alanine aminotransferase, and aspartate aminotransaminase levels were significantly lower after 3 days of treatment than before treatment (13.1 vs. 8.0, P = 0.043; 9.8 vs. 1.5, P = 0.028; 133.4 vs. 31.9, P = 0.028; 282.4 vs. 50.5, P = 0.046, respectively). Nine patients (31.0%, 9/29) died at discharge, and a significantly difference was found between the PLEX group and non-PLEX group [0 vs. 47.4% (9/19), P = 0.011]. The median follow-up period was 27 months, and three patients were lost to follow-up. Thirteen patients (50.0%, 13/26) died at the last follow-up, comprising three (33.3%, 3/9) in the PLEX group and ten (58.8%, 10/17) in the non-PLEX group, but there was no significant difference between the two groups (P = 0.411). Three patients (10.3%, 3/29) fully recovered. Interpretation: PLEX may reduce serum C-reactive protein and procalcitonin levels and improve liver function in the short term. PLEX may improve the prognosis of ANEC, and further studies are needed.",

Cytokine storm, [3] [4] [5] hereditary susceptibility, 6, 7 immune etiology, 8 and other unknown factors are related to ANE pathogenesis. The prognosis of ANE was poor. The mortality of ANE was around 30%, and only 10% of patients fully recovered. 2, [9] [10] [11] A unified treatment schedule for acute necrotizing encephalopathy of childhood (ANEC) has not been established. Steroids and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) for immunomodulation therapy are the most commonly used drugs to treat ANEC, 9, 12, 13 and early steroid pulse therapy has been recommended. 14 Moreover, plasma exchange (PLEX) has recently been reported for some ANEC patients, which could be an effective treatment to remove inflammatory mediators and other harmful substances that are caused by ANEC, but the outcome has been variable. 9, 15, 16 In this study, a multicenter retrospective study was conducted at four pediatric intensive care units (PICUs) in China, and it aimed to investigate the efficacy of PLEX therapy in treating ANEC.",

A patient with COVID-19 related ANE was treated with PLEX and survived at discharge, but required rehabilitation therapy after discharge. 15 Among 13 patients with ANEC, three patients underwent five cycles of PLEX after a poor or no response to the initial immunomodulation treatment, and they were alive at discharge. 16 Aksoy et al 21 reported on nine children with ANE, and the six patients who received immunomodulation therapy and PLEX survived. Two of whom received PLEX when there was no clinical improvement with immunomodulation therapy.
