Yet modern societies are currently facing the problem of how to put limits on progress, expansion, and growth, live within them, and preserve (rather than transcend) the present. Drawing on economic sociology scholarship on valuation and morality in economic life, this article develops and applies the term economization to analyze the enactment of limits on progress. The question of end-of-life care-when to stop medical efforts to prolong life, postpone death, and advance the scientific frontier-serves as an illustrative empirical case that sheds light on limit-setting in general. My analysis of this case combines historical, ethnographic, and in-depth interview data on US palliative care clinicians, who specialize in making life-and-death decisions in acute care hospitals.",

Economists are suggesting that \"the rapid progress made over the past 250 years could well turn out to be a unique episode in human history\" (Gordon, 2016) and that \"the 21st century may see a return to a low growth regime\" (Piketty, 2014, p. 72 ). This flattening of economic growth curves would not be due to a temporary recession, but to long-term tendencies: the exhaustion of past revolutionary innovations, these innovations' historical singularity, and the unlikelihood that similar breakthroughs will ever occur again. 1 Similarly, consider the basic assertion of environmentalists that any growth occurs within the limits of Earth's categorical physical limits and will have to adjust to these limits (Meadows et al., 1971) . Here and elsewhere, progress is regarded as achievable, but only at a price that is too high and bound to ultimately spark a cataclysmic and regressive collapse (D'Alisa et al., 2015) . If the modern condition was a state of constant expansion, a pivotal challenge in our time is how to moderate and control this expansion, handle excess, and bend the curves that Figs. 1 and 2 present (cf. Abbott, 2014) .",

The stakes of these endeavors are extremely high. For one thing, they mark out modernity's farthermost reaches-the points beyond which meaningful progress is unachievable, meaningless, or self-destructive. They therefore delimit (read: define) human agency.

            "text": "The case study I use to illustrate this point is the attempt to contain medicine's effort to prolong human life. Prolonging life and postponing death is perhaps the modern medical sciences' most emblematic goal. Medicine's capacity to cure disease, reduce mortality, and prolong existence is a most palpable testimony to human beings' success in controlling nature and transcending the limits of their own biology. In the past few decades, however, medical advent has attracted much doubt. Many argue that medicine often prolongs lives of compromised quality and that scientific triumphs over disease result in agonized states of existence, which few find meaningful. Since the cost of lifeprolonging treatments outpaces economic growth, the prolongation of these unwanted lives also puts a financial burden on developed countries' economies. The question of limits therefore manifests as a multifaceted challenge, in part financial, in part medical, in part existential: when should we admit the limits of our capacity to control nature, stop prolonging life, and allow death to occur? I analyze how this question is addressed in the US, asking how social institutions in the country enact limits on medicine and life prolongation. The focus on the US allows me to examine the enactment of limits as it plays out in a relatively individualized and decentralized market system. Countries with centralized healthcare systems have been able to exercise direct controls on medical utilization and spending. A quintessential and often-cited example is the United Kingdom's National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), which stipulates a ceiling price of \u00a330,000 for treatments that prolong life by an average of one year, adjusted for quality (Ashmore et al., 1989) . Treatments whose cost effectiveness does not meet this threshold may be covered only after additional review. By contrast, US healthcare's decentralized market structure means that such direct policy controls are unlikely to emerge and be effective (cf. Hacker, 2002) . The US places much emphasis on individual patients' right to participate in decisions on their care and provide their \"informed consent\" to treatments they wish to receive or forgo, which makes such decisions relatively contingent and idiosyncratic. Furthermore, medical decision-making in the US is distributed across numerous professional and organizational actors: patients hold different insurance policies, receive care in different hospitals and from different physicians-with each having different policies and standards for how and how far to go in treating severe illness.",

My focus is on groups of patients and clinicians who, beginning the 1960s, mobilized to challenge modern medicine's categorical emphasis on prolonging life and postponing death. Their mobilization institutionalized into an influential movement, hospice and palliative care, which launched extensive public and expert discussions on the worth of life in severe illness. These discussions mobilized millions of people to reflect and make statements on the value they found in a life with various medical conditions, which effectively marked the limit beyond which life would no longer be meaningful to them.",

            "text": "I propose the term economization-and its conjugations as a verb, adjective, and verbal adjective: to economize, economized, and economizing-as instructive in analyzing social dynamics around limits and finitude. In current economic sociology discourse, the term and its multiple conjugations are vague. They carry numerous and often inconsistent meanings, in part because their related noun (economy) has acquired different connotations over the past century (see Mitchell, 2002; Polanyi, 1992) . To add to the conceptual vagueness, economic sociology has not developed its own theoretical notion of \"economy\" (Granovetter, 1990; Granovetter & Swedberg, 2011; Krippner & Alvarez, 2007) . The field's dominant paradigm centered on Mark Granovetter's idea of embeddedness and took the market, not the economy, as its main object of interest. When the term appeared in his writing, Granovetter referred to the economy as a realm that may be embedded in society to different degrees (Granovetter, 1985) . This concept of embeddedness enveloped \"the asocial market construct in social relations, all the while preserving intact the notion that somewhere there was a hard core of market behavior existing outside of social life\" (Krippner, 2001, pp. 777-778) . To this day, Granovetter uses the term economy in a colloquial and untheorized fashion, as something \"having to do with the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services-what we might call the 'hard core' of economic activity\" (Granovetter, 2017, p. 2). Granovetter and his followers have effectively adopted economists' definition of the economy (Krippner, 2001) .",

            "text": "Other and more culturally inclined branches of economic sociology avoided defining \"economy\" (and hence economization) for the opposite reason: they sought to transcend all distinctions between economy and non-economy, treating economic institutions as quintessentially social (e.g. Almeling, 2007 Almeling, , 2011 Anteby, 2010; Chan, 2009 Chan, , 2012 Kameo, 2015; Lainer-Vos, 2012; Quinn, 2008; Wherry, 2011) . Commonly known as \"morals and markets\" scholarship, this approach took on studying economies as societies-places where collective conscience, identities, and moral categories are formed (Fourcade & Healy, 2013 . Viviana Zelizer, who laid out the field's most elaborate analytical framework, defined her approach as relational sociology: studying how people create and negotiate distinctions between different social relations, economic or non-economic (Bandelj, 2020; Zelizer, 2004a Zelizer, , 2004b Zelizer, , 2011 Zelizer, , 2012 . The same applied to scholars in the emergent field of valuation studies, who used the terms \"values\" and \"valuation\" in analyzing all human activities, whether or not they are traditionally regarded as \"economic\" (Beckert & Aspers, 2011; Boltanski & Th\u00e9venot, 1999; Christin, 2018; Espeland & Sauder, 2007; Kiviat, 2019; Stark, 2000) . This rendered attempts to define economy and economization processes self-defeating and counterproductive (\u00c7ali\u015fkan & Callon, 2009). 2 My own theorization of the term \"economy\" embraces the strong view that no apriori distinctions should be drawn between \"economic\" or \"social\" domains. Yet with that in mind, I maintain that a redefinition of the term \"economy\" as an important object of analysis in economic sociology is due. Following \u00c7ali\u015fkan and Callon, I treat \"economy\" as a processual outcome and shift the discussion from defining what economy means to analyzing economization processes (\u00c7ali\u015fkan & Callon, 2009 (\u00c7ali\u015fkan & Callon, , 2010 . My approach, however, goes beyond \u00c7ali\u015fkan and Callon's argument, which defined economization as the qualification of certain things and behaviors as \"economic\" using an economic theory. I view economization as a process that can develop independently of any theory. Following economic anthropologists and valuation scholars, I define economies in general and market economies in particular as \"regimes of valuation\"-relatively organized and enduring patterns of ascribing cultural, moral, and financial worth to people, behaviors, qualities, and objects (Abend, 2014; Appadurai, 1986; Beckert & Aspers, 2011; Boltanski & Th\u00e9venot, 1999) . Economization means a purposeful establishment, or unplanned emergence, of such a regime of valuation-an overdetermined process that may have multiple sources. Economization and economies are not necessarily market-based, nor do they have to be monetary (E. P. Berman, 2014) . One can think, for example, of socialist and communist economies; \"moral economies\" (Abend, 2014; Fontaine, 2014; Scott, 1976; Thompson, 1971) ; domestic, informal, and gendered economies (Folbre, 1991 (Folbre, , 2001 Portes, 1994; Zelizer, 1994) ; and non-market economies, which draw on reciprocity and redistribution (Polanyi, 2001) . Polanyi aptly observed that, \"The anthropologist, the sociologist or the historian [face] [\u2026] a great variety of institutions other than markets, in which man's livelihood [is] embedded\" (Polanyi, 1992, p. 30) . Defining economies as regimes of valuation, however, means an even more inclusive definition of economy, since there are many regimes of valuation that do not directly pertain to human livelihood and material welfare (Lamont, 2012) . These would be, for example, economies that emerge around civic regimes of valuation that ascribe value based on contribution to collective virtues, or economies of aesthetic value that valorize inspiration, passion, and any break with the quotidian, usual, and mundane (Abend, 2014; Boltanski & Th\u00e9venot, 1999; Polanyi, 1977) .",

First, economization involves stipulating, and hence somewhat binding, the ascribed value of the things included in the economy in question. When determining value, one necessarily delimits it (Graeber, 2002) . For example, assigning monetary value-a price-to a certain object is an assertion that this object's monetary value does not rise above or fall below this price. By contrast, characterizing something as \"priceless\"-i.e. labeling it as having infinite, indefinable monetary worth-is equal to stating that it does not belong in a monetary economy. This was, for example, the case with children, who in the early twentieth century gained sentimental value and lost financial value. Children became priceless, meaning that they were excluded from the monetary economy (Zelizer, 1985) . 3 In the case of end-oflife care, I will show that specifying the value that one ascribes to life involves marking the limits beyond which life would be meaningless, hence delimiting and binding life's value.",

            "text": "Second, as regimes of valuation, economies enact social hierarchies and boundaries. Capitalist market economies, for example, hierarchize people and organizations using credit scores, bond ratings, and loyalty programs that differentiate between \"silver,\" \"gold,\" and \"platinum\" members (Fourcade & Healy, 2016) . Economization involves deploying such classifications, scales, and status markers, which grant differential access to resources and benefits. Beyond establishing hierarchies, economization processes also enact boundaries that determine inclusions and exclusions from a certain economy. The meaning of exclusion is evident to anyone living without a credit-score or a social security number. It is not about being undervalued but about not being valuated at all, which means non-existence in a certain economy. Consider, for example, the case of women who were assigned their husbands' credit scores and lost all credit history upon divorcing them, or residents of redlined, majority-black neighborhoods who were virtually excluded from credit markets. Struggles for inclusion in such cases were fights for economic citizenship and had quintessential civic characteristics (Krippner, 2017; Robinson, 2020; Taylor, 2019) . Success in these struggles, however, meant inclusion in the credit economy and subjection to its hierarchical order at the same time (Taylor, 2019) . Economization, therefore, involves drawing social boundaries and establishing criteria for belonging, which hierarchize and differentiate among those included.",

An economization process can originate from completely anti-economistic thinking-as in cases where socially patterned regimes of valuation originated from religious (Abend, 2014; Weber, 2011) , aesthetic (Karpik, 2010) , or civic discourses (Boltanski & Th\u00e9venot, 1999) . In the case of end-of-life care, I show that much of the economization process is attributable to a humanistic moral thinking.

Within this area, I chose three hospitals that served different demographics-a public safety-net hospital, a private hospital, and an academic medical center. Each of these hospitals had a palliative care team, 4 which I joined for a total of 80 days over the course of 13 months during 2011-2012. I shadowed clinicians in their day-to-day work and participated in their staff meetings. I sat in on family conferences, observing clinicians talk to patients and their families about terminal diagnoses and grim prognoses, the goals of their medical care, and whether or not to withhold or withdraw life-sustaining interventions. I watched clinicians as they read patients' charts and formulated opinions regarding their conditions and chances of survival. I observed clinicians talking among themselves about whether to continue prolonging patients' lives, given their medical conditions and their stated or unstated wishes. During the same period, I conducted 80 in-depth interviews with clinicians and administrators from these three hospitals, as well as three additional hospitals. Interviewees included nurses, social workers, case managers, administrators, and physicians of different specialties. I employed a targeted snowball sampling strategy, relying on interviewees referring me to other interviewees, while purposefully aiming to include people of various professional backgrounds, clinical stances, and demographic groups.",

Categorical as it was, this position was unexceptional and echoed a strong modernist narrative that was dominant during the period.

Increased federal funding gave rise to big medicine and instigated the corporatization of US healthcare (Starr, 1982) . Pharmaceutical companies, medical device producers, private insurers, and hospital networks grew into an enormous corporate sector, making the ethos of medical progress materialize in a combination of endless professional ambition and overwhelming financial capacity.

Like political reason in the eighteenth century, they introduced intrinsic boundaries, which economized the imperative to prolong life and counter disease indefinitely. Economization meant a shift from medical maximalism to a more measured and restrained orientation, which hinged on determining, and hence binding, the value of medical treatments and the worth of the lives they sustained.

Similar observations echoed in much of the period's critical writing on medicine (Bunker, 1970; Notzon et al., 1987; Sontag, 1978) and in classical medical sociology works (Freidson, 1970, p. 258; Parsons, 1951, pp. 466-467) . The modern hospital, which became a most central medical institution by the 1920s, was an emblem of dehumanizing and technical medical professionalism that treated patients as objects and not as people (Chambliss, 1996; Rosenberg, 1987; Stevens, 1989) . Many medical practitioners were concerned about these developments. Prominent Harvard physician Alfred Worcester dedicated an entire book to arguing against aggressive life-prolonging treatments in elderly patients, writing that physical decline was \"inevitable\" and \"not pathological,\" and should therefore be treated as \"a perfectly natural process.\" He recommended that physicians who treat the elderly adopt a \"regressive r\u00e9gime\"-namely, phase out medical interventions and allow physical degeneration to take its natural course. Oncologists, Worcester contended, should not treat cancers in elderly patients, and dentists should stop offering them dental prostheses, since teeth loss may be \"the natural safeguard for the aged against overeating.\" \"Artificial teeth and culinary triumphs,\" he concluded, \"are the disguised enemies of a healthy old age\" (Worcester, 1961) . While physicians in later decades did not go as far as rebuking mushed food and protein shakes, many of them questioned the limits of what medicine could achieve and the consequences of pursuing unrestrained lifeprolongation. Oncologists during the 1950s were explicit in stating that their capacity to prolong life was very limited; oncology journals often referred to chemotherapy as \"palliative care\"-treatment that could control symptoms and reduce pain and, at the same time, prolong life (Baszanger, 2012) . Outside of oncology and mainstream medicine, groups of physicians and non-physicians organized numerous conferences that laid the foundations of the field of bioethics. End-of-life care and the limits of modern medicine were and continue to be among their main topics of concern (R. C. Fox & Swazey, 2008; Jonsen, 1998) .",

Hospice began as a morally motivated call from clinicians to acknowledge the limits of medicine, human agency, and scientific progress-a search for a medical diminuendo that would replace an otherwise unmitigated crescendo. Hospice advocates formulated and applied a new regime of medical valuation, which assessed the worth and quality of various lives and, consequently, the morality and professional appropriateness of the medical interventions that sustained these lives. Echoing ideas such as Worcester's, hospice advocates criticized medicine for treating death as an abnormality-a negative and traumatic event that should always be battled and postponed. Modern medicine, they argued, denied the finitude of human existence and treated disease as if life could be prolonged indefinitely. Modern hospices, by contrast, embraced death as integral to life: they replaced medical maximalism-the unquestionable and categorical emphasis on prolonging life and postponing death in all circumstances-with a focus on facilitating comfortable and dignified deaths. \"To go on pressing for acute, active treatment at a stage when a patient has gone too far and should not be made to return is not good medicine,\" wrote London clinician Cicely Saunders, the hospice movement's most eminent pioneer (Saunders, 1969, pp. 57-58) . She and her disciples found the value of care not in medical interventions that transcended nature, but in their suspension and replacement with an acceptance of the limits of human life and medical capacity.",

By the 2010s, American hospices served an estimated 1.65 million people, and 44.6% of all deaths in the country occurred in a hospice program (NHPCO, 2012) (see Fig. 3 ).

Ideas that were initially anti-medical, anti-professional, and anti-institutional-e.g. Kubler-Ross's (1969) call to de-medicalize death, allow people to die at home, and provide care that draws on personal relations rather than medical guidelines-became the new rule book of hospice practitioners, who now pursued the \"acceptance\" of death as a key goal of care (Broom, 2015) .",

In 1994, George Soros's Open Society Institute (OSI) launched Project On Death in America (PDIA). Over ten years of existence, the project sought to simultaneously build a \"professional field\" for end-of-life care and \"change (Livne, 2014) the culture of dying\" in the US. PDIA paid the salaries of 87 fellows (mostly physicians), whom it ordained as the field's \"leaders.\" By 2003, this group authored over 2000 articles in the area and raised over $113 million for research (Clark, 2013) . It topicalized the end of life (Broom, 2015) -i.e. made \"the end of life\" a visible, recognizable topic in medical journals and in the popular media (Figs. 4 and 5) . PDIA aimed to send these fellows-turned-leaders back to their hospitals and medical schools to train the next generation of clinicians, setting the target of placing at least three faculty members who promote end-of-life care in all U.S medical schools (OSI, 2004:55) . The program also supported writing curricula and textbooks on the topic for physicians, nurses, and social workers (Clark, 2013) .",

It offered an alternative to the modernist frontier mentality with a critical scrutiny of the value of medical interventions, labelling many procedures as futile, immoral, and medically misinformed. The limits hospice and palliative care set on medical treatment were intrinsic rather than extrinsic: clinicians were no longer constrained just by the areas science has not yet reached and conquered.

In the US, however, most of these visions and proposed policies are theoretical, and the reality on the ground is remotely different from them. The Medicare statute-the closest the country has ever come to a centralized and standard-setting healthcare system-determines that Medicare should provide coverage for all \"reasonable and necessary\" treatments, without defining what qualifies as \"reasonable\" or \"necessary,\" let alone specifying how costs should play into consideration. Apart from choosing the least costly alternative among equivalent treatments (itself a difficult judgment to make), the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services have not taken costs into account explicitly when making determinations on coverage (J. Fox, 2010; Neumann & Chambers, 2012) . The case is similar with concrete medical decisions at the bedside: clinicians can stop treatment because they (Livne, 2019) consider it \"futile,\" yet there are no bureaucratically imposed rules requiring them to withdraw or withhold care from patients just because their treatment is too expensive.",

Several studies in the late 1970s that evaluated the relative cost of hospice were equivocal (e.g. Comptroller General, 1979; Hospice Project Task Force, 1980) . The Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) was doubtful and recommended that Congress wait for conclusive results from a more rigorous and federally funded study that was launched during the period. NHO advocates, however, continued pressure on Congress, claiming that data analysis in this study was slow. They insisted hospice could save money and invoked the argument in every congressional hearing on the topic, at times citing anecdotal evidence from individual hospices that managed to save several thousands of dollars by cutting spending on invasive measures and days of hospitalization. 7 In 1982, Congress voted to approve the hospice benefit, based on what two prominent researchers defined as \"limited information,\" \"case study reports,\" and \"anecdotally based vignettes\" (Mor & Barnbaum, 1983) .",

The reliable new public funding, combined with the aging of the US population, made hospices attractive to for-profit corporations. By 2016, two thirds of the US hospice industry were for-profit and much of it provided high Return On Investment. Chemed Corporation, the company owning the country's largest hospice (Vitas), added some 315% to its share value in 2014-2019, about three times more than Apple and Google did during the same period. 9 Disagreements over hospices' cost-saving potential continue to this day and have led researchers and organizations to conduct new cost-evaluations (Emanuel & Emanuel, 1994) . None of these studies were conclusive, yet they added up to a corpus of research that valuated end-of-life care monetarily, made the dollar price of life prolongation visible, and invited discussions on how to reduce it. As a professional movement, hospices topicalized the end of life and made it a realm of medical expertise (Broom, 2015) . As political actors, the movement's advocates made this realm the center of financial discussions. Politicians, economists, and advocates who debated whether or not hospices could save money instituted a general understanding that the end of life was, potentially, an area where financial saving could and should be achieved.",

Such evaluations became possible after the passing of Medicare, which provided analysts with datasets of unprecedented quality and consistency on medical spending and utilization. In 1973, the Social Security Bulletin reported that Medicare's spending on \"patients who died\" was significantly higher than its spending on survivors (Piro & Lutins, 1973) . That year, health economist Joseph Civetta echoed this finding, writing that, in a Massachusetts ICU that he studied, \"costs [\u2026] seem to be inversely correlated with chances of survival\" (Civetta, 1973) . He clarified that this provocative statement was not causal, meaning that it was impossible to predict patients' survival based on how costly their treatment has been. 10 Yet the subtext was clear: Medicare was disbursing enormous 7 E.g.

Hugh Westbrook, US House of Representatives, \"Medicare in Florida: looking to the future,\" hearing before the select committee on aging, 98th Congress, 1st session, December 28, 1983, P. 77. 9 Data are from Yahoo Finance. 10 This point was recently corroborated using predictive modeling (Einav et al., 2018) . amounts of money on failed treatments-as evidenced by the fact that the treatments' recipients died. By the late 1970s, health economists were warning that medical advent was financially unsustainable. \"Those responsible for advancing medical frontiers,\" Cullen et al. wrote, \"do not consider the financial impact of providing increasingly costly, high-quality intensive care on a large scale.",

The advocates approached a variety of organizations (e.g. hospitals, state agencies, and insurers), encouraged them to look at their spending in the area, and argued that they could save costs if they adopted palliative care. In the 2010s, the Center to Advance Palliative Care (CAPC) began training palliative care clinicians on collecting data on the money they saved their hospitals through reducing the use of expensive life-prolonging measures (Pantilat et al., 2007; Warner & Gualtieri-Reed, 2014) . Practitioners could then show their administrations that their service would pay for itself by saving resources that would have otherwise been spent on keeping severely ill patients alive.

Different hospitals work on different business models; a safety-net hospital funded by fixed county budgets with little income from insurance companies has a different financial interest than a hospital that treats an insured patient population and generates income on a fee-for-service basis. For the latter, reducing intensive care and medical interventions may reduce income rather than save money. Furthermore, documenting hospital costs in the US is a fairly abstract undertaking.

Another way was authoring reports such as \"The Business Case for Palliative Care,\" which analyzed the financial interests of different hospital systems and explicated why palliative care services would serve all of them (Pantilat et al., 2007) . This report maintained that the US was moving toward managed care and away from fee-for-service payment, predicting that hospitals would face pressures from insurance companies and regulators to reduce utilization.

The regime of valuation that the economization of dying enacted expressed life, death, and dying in professional, as well as monetary terms. Evaluating the benefits of life-prolonging and life-sustaining treatments also meant evaluating the high spending on them, informing the enactment of financial and medical limits at the end of life.",

Starting in the 1960s, against the backdrop of the civil rights movement and the mobilization of patient advocates and ethicists, the individual patient assumed a pivotal role in medical decision-making. The principle of \"patient autonomy\" became the dominant doctrine in US bioethics, replacing more traditional approaches that based medical decisions on physicians' professional authority and what they judged to be patients' best interests. A new generation of clinicians was now expected to recognize the patient's right to weigh in on decisions, exercise sovereignty, and be free from external professional and institutional coercion (see Arney & Bergen, 1984; Dworkin, 1993; Evans, 2002 ; R. C. Fox & Swazey, 2008; Katz, 1984) . Laws, declarations, and guidelines that passed in the following decades made it hard to treat patients without their consent and against their will. 13 Beyond any formal statutory constraint, treating patients against their will and for their own good became morally questionable, even intolerable. Patients' choices, opinions, and preferences were now an ethical compass, a pillar of fire that guided clinicians through dilemmas and quandaries, granting value and legitimacy to certain courses of treatment and rendering others morally flawed and ethically misguided. The two regimes of medical and monetary valuation were combined with a third regime, in which patients were the main actors entitled to judge the worth of their life and the medical care used to prolong it: a life worth living was a life that a patient felt was worth living.",

During the late 1960s, the same period that hospices developed, popular discourse in the US was filled with critical conversations about death and dying. Historian Peter Filene found that, from 1968 to 1973, the number of articles on the topic in masscirculation magazines doubled each year, then doubled again from 1973 to 1975 (Filene, 1998, p. 49) . The same applied to books (see Fig. 4 ). 14 Numerous memoirs by terminally ill patients and their survivors were published during the period (Filene, 1998, p. 49; see Bell, 1961; Hanlan, 1979; Scott Bermer, 1979; Smith, 1969; West, 1966 West, , 1976 , and so were critiques of the medicalization of death and the silencing and objectification of patients (Filene, 1998; Kubler-Ross, 1969; Mannes, 1974) . No less intriguing were books with titles such as \"To Die with Style\" (McCoy, 1974) , \"Living Your Dying\" (Keleman, 1975) , \"Learning to Die, Learning to Live\" (Herhold, 1976) , and even \"It's Your Death\u2026 Make the Most of It\" (Billnitzer, 1980 )-which expressed and popularized very particular views on death and dying. Authors valorized the acceptance of death, presenting it as a moral virtue and a sign of one's strength of character: \"I have come to believe it is possible for us to live into our deaths with energy and integrity,\" Marjory McCoy wrote. \"It may not be possible to eliminate entirely the existential fear of that awesome Unknown, but I do believe we can consciously utilize the kind of trust and courage with which we face the many unknowns of life\" (McCoy, 1974, pp. 14-15) .",

The dying processes described as a \"good death\" represented the views and experiences of a particular social class: primarily highly educated, white, and middle to higher income people, who had access to healthcare throughout their lifetime and whose chief concern was a problem of excess, i.e. receiving too much treatment-\"surfeit,\" in Abbott's terms (2014).

Beginning with the first hearings that Congress held on care for the dying in 1972, advocates brought terminal patients, family caregivers, and survivors of deceased patients to testify in Washington about their personal experiences. The unified patient voice in these hearings defied medical maximalism and embraced the abstemious approach, which dovetailed hospice ideas. During 1972-1990, twenty-nine people shared with Congressional committees narratives of their personal experiences with terminal illness or as caretakers of a terminally ill relative. 16 In various ways, all of them said they preferred moderate and non-\"aggressive\" treatment at the end of life, and all of the witnesses who had experience with hospice described it in very positive terms. 17 There are indications, however, that other, uneconomized and maximalist voices existed but were not heard. A Pew survey conducted in 1990, 2005, and 2013 showed that a significant and growing proportion of Americans support the categorically maximalist stance that \"in all circumstances, doctors and nurses should do everything possible to save the life of a patient.\" 31% of the respondents endorsed this statement in 2013, up from 15% in 1990. The percentage of people who agreed with the equivocal statement \"sometimes [emphasis mine] there are circumstances where a patient should be allowed to die\" declined from 73 to 66% during the same period (Pew Research Center, 2013) . Support for the uneconomized maximalist statement was significantly higher among African American respondents (52%), Latino respondents (59%), and respondents without college education (43%) compared to white respondents (20%) and those with a college education (18%). Unlike what K\u00fcbler Ross and hospice advocates assumed, the professional and financial economization of end-of-life care is gradually coming to collide with many patients' valuations of life and life-prolonging treatment. Patient autonomy has been central to this process, as it empowered many patients to demand that their lives be extended as much as possible. Alongside an extremely powerful medical-industrial complex-which inundates patients with information about new treatments, medications, and devices that promise miracles-autonomy provided fertile grounds not only for economization, but also for resistance to economization (Kaufman, 2015) .",

An explanation I heard several times was that African Americans were likely to insist on continuing life-prolongation against physicians' advice because of mistrust in medicine and the healthcare system. The demographic composition of the three palliative care services I studied in-depth was not conducive to interracial trust-building: all but one of the clinicians in them were Caucasian. 21 Still, with few exceptions (e.g. a chaplain who suggested that her all-white team may have alienated an African American family), the clinicians described mistrust as a property of African Americans, not a relational outcome of contact between all-white medical teams and a patient (or family) of color.",

The Intensive Care Unit (ICU) physicians of a public, safety-net hospital consulted its palliative care service on the case of a young African American patient, who had suffered a heart attack and was connected to a ventilator in a condition they defined as 'close to brain dead.' 22 The man's sister and stepsister were very involved with his care and visited the hospital regularly. In a team meeting, a palliative care physician noted that the ICU team reported 'difficult' interactions with the sisters and mentioned that they 'wanted to ensure that he gets the maximum care possible.' In her first meeting with the palliative care physician, one sister expressed frustration with an ICU physician, saying that when she came to visit her brother this physician took her aside and talked to her about 'pulling the plug on him' before she even put on the gown. Later on, the sister told the palliative care team's chaplain about two relatives whom doctors had given 'no chance,' and yet one of them was still living 'almost independently.' At a later palliative care team meeting, the physician spoke about her meeting with the sister. She told the sister that the patient was not feeling any pain, and then added that medical interventions may make him uncomfortable. The sister challenged her: 'if you've just said he's not feeling any painhow is it possible that interventions would make him uncomfortable?', to which the physician responded: 'we don't know what he feels and doesn't feel, but I always take interventions as inherently uncomfortable.' The physician promised the sister that she would keep seeing the patient and would also make sure that the nurses played his favorite music in the room. They scheduled a follow-up phone call for the next day.",

Yet, at the end of the last meeting, after the physician informed everyone that the family decided to remove the patient from life support, the team's chaplain asked if the 'race card [sic] played a role in any way here.'

In all likelihood, the palliative care team's all-white racial composition extended the leap of faith required from the sisters to enter any discussion of economization. Their marginalization in the case was multi-dimensional. First, the medical staff looked at the sisters and the patient as racialized Others-people with qualities that differed from a certain imagined norm, who required special attention and \"cultural skills.\" The clinicians treated a relational phenomenon-the chasm between an all-white medical team and an African American family-as a race-specific quality: mistrust that African Americans in general, hence this family in particular, feel. Second, from the palliative care perspective, the initial position that the sisters embraced-refusal to engage in any decision on economizationwas branded as misguided, irrational, and immoral: it made little sense to clinicians that a patient who was \"nearly brain dead\" would be kept on life-support. Within the regime of valuation that palliative care advanced, such families were discounted, and minoritized populations had a higher likelihood to be among them.",

For one thing, as Bernard Lahire observed, ascribing stability, essentiality, and consistency to human agency is an abstracting act. It means affixing vicissitude by reducing the plurality of actions, predispositions, caprices, and idiosyncratic tendencies that comprise human agency into a single, unified personhood. This reduction is commonplace, and not only in the medical setting: social security numbers, first and last names, awards and honors, and penal systems that hold people accountable for crimes they committed decades earlier make up a social order that defines and thereby configures people as coherent and singular actors (Lahire, 2011). In US healthcare, the spread and influence of patient autonomy principles has made it institutionally necessary to treat patients as such singular actors. Once patients' judgment and valuation came to indicate how physicians should treat them, clinicians needed-and therefore demanded and incited-patients to express themselves and make their agency manifest coherently, so that it could inform decision-making (Arney & Bergen, 1984, p. 194) .",

Among other statements, the cards included: \"to maintain my dignity,\" \"to be kept clean,\" \"to say goodbye to people in my life,\" \"not dying alone,\" \"to be mentally aware,\" \"to have my family with me,\" \"to be at home,\" and \"not being connected to machines.\" 25 The activity's outcome-various statements on end-of-life care that the patient rankedwere treated as reflective of how the patient valued her or his life: what they found most meaningful in life, what life-activities they would prioritize, and what qualified as a meaningful life to them in general.

Yet this divergence has regularities, which also enact hierarchies within the end-of-life economy. First, privileged populations are more likely to embrace the abstemious stances that correlate with end-of-life care's two other regimes of valuation. These populations' subjective tastes mirror the \"less is more\" pattern of valuation that defines the field, which accounts for one source of hierarchy within the end-of-life care economy: the subjective tastes and experiences of privileged populations have come to define what a \"good death\" means. Second, privileged populations are far more likely to exhibit agency that matches the liberal assumptions of patient autonomy. Their access to healthcare and resources such as advance directives, public events, focus groups, and medical teams that acknowledge them and discuss their preferences at the bedside means better access to formulating, documenting, and voicing intelligible values that clinicians can then recognize.",

As defined here, economization means the establishment of a regime of valuation, i.e. the institutionalization of shared patterns of value attribution in a certain domain. I have identified three interwoven parts of this regime of valuation, which comprise the economization of end-of-life care. The first is the medical regime that hospice and palliative care advocates have promoted, which contends that when it comes to end-of-life care, less treatment is oftentimes more valuable. The second is a monetary regime that valuates the end-of-life financially and induces hospitals, insurers, and policymakers to conduct themselves more frugally and consider limiting interventions based on financial calculus. The third is a patient-focused regime, which designates the individual patient as an authority whose personality and values legitimize (or delegitimize) the prolongation of her or his life, and then mobilizes large populations to ascribe value to life in different conditions and, by extension, to the care that sustains it. These three regimes of valuation coalesce into an overall restraining force in US healthcare, whose focus is not on transcending death and going beyond current medical capacities, but on embracing and accepting mortality as an objective limit on human existence. This means defying a very basic modernist ambition to progress beyond the given.",

Instead, palliative care clinicians might mention, for example, a patient's expressed wishes to a family member, this patient's grim prognosis to a fellow physician, and the high cost of treatment to an administrator.

Economy as a principle of medical care transformed from a private and individual practice of doctors at the bedside into a major professional, moral, and political movement, because the approach's advocates understood, adapted to, and capitalized on the political opportunities of the period.

First, by generating monetary, professional, and patient-focused valuations of life, the economization of end-of-life care has somewhat bound and moderated an otherwise categorical pursuit of life prolongation. Once patients, professionals, and administrators engage in defining what counts as a meaningful and valuable life, they also make determinations on when this life is meaningless and when its prolongation should therefore stop. Second, the economization of end-of-life care has been a hierarchical process, which elevated certain moral views and marginalized others. Hospice and palliative care emerged around the experience of upper and middle class people, whose major concern with healthcare has been excess. The rejection of aggressive life prolongation, which largely came from these circles, was a socially specific moral sentiment that the movement attempted to universalize. It was these upper and middle class populations that the economization of end-of-life care mobilized most successfully, as they were the ones who filled out advance directive orders and generated rankings of end-of-life preferences and values. Their advantageous social position meant that they were able to define what a \"good death\" meant in general and also establish an economy that would help them pursue these definitions. Lastly, the economization of end-of-life care informed and influenced the actions of patients, clinicians, and organizations that began valuating life and medical care in new patterns and methods. It changed how clinicians approached and treated cases of severe illness, how hospitals evaluated the organizational and financial challenges these cases posed, and how individual patients contemplated the value and meaning of their own lives.",

Consider the climate crisis. It is possible to think of further progress as a solution to this crisis: the progressive 2019 Green New Deal proposal, for example, deliberately called for \"national, social, and industrial mobilization on a scale not seen since World War II and the New Deal Era,\" which would foster the development of new green technologies and also pull the US out of the social and economic stagnation it has experienced since the 1970s. 27 Yet ultimately, what prescribes the direction of this mobilization are inflexible environmental and temporal limits, delineated and collectively recognized in a social process. The Club of Rome's 1971 declaration was an early indication of this dynamic: \"If the present growth trends in world population, industrialization, pollution, food production, and resource depletion continue unchanged, the limits to growth on this planet will be reached sometime within the next hundred years\" (Meadows et al., 1971) . To this day, efforts to address the climate crisis take the form of determining \"planetary boundaries\" that economic, population, and other forms of growth should not exceed (Rockstr\u00f6m et al., 2009) , maximum average temperatures and carbon levels that humanity should not surpass, and time frames for the world to reach carbon neutrality (IPCC, 2018) . The goal is not transcending upper limits, but identifying and enforcing them, i.e., restraining the modern growth trajectory before the Weberian moment arrives and \"the last ton of fossil fuel has been consumed\" (Weber, 2011, pp. 120-121) . From this point in history, the future promises stagnation in the best case scenario and a regressive series of losses in the more likely one (Elliott, 2018) .",

The most basic attribute of progressive politics has been envisioning ideas that differ from present states of affairs and mobilizing people to make them a reality. In some circles, this politics is still alive, as evident in the World Social Forum's declaration that \"Another World is Possible\" (Fisher & Ponniah, 2015) and in Erik Wright's call for a sociology of real utopias (Wright, 2010 ). Yet, as Wright himself acknowledged, this type of utopian thinking has been in decline for decades-to the point that utopianism has become synonymous with impractical and unrealistic politics. Claus Offe suggested that the most central progressive mobilizations today do not pursue futures that differ from the present, but defend and preserve already-won victories and states of being. Campaigns to \"keep abortion legal,\" \"defend affirmative action,\" \"protect public education,\" bring taxation back to its 1960s levels, and protect the environment do not imagine alternative futures, but seek to preserve the present by putting \"stop signs\" in the way of reactionary and regressive shifts (Offe, 2019) .",

Pursuing high growth rates has long been a panacea for social and political problems-a way to sideline debates over distributive justice (how to divide the pie) with a promise to grow the entire pie for everyone's benefit. This framework, however, has weakened over the past half century (D'Alisa et al., 2015) . For one thing, many economists have grown doubtful about the feasibility of continued high growth. Robert Gordon argued that high growth in the US was restricted to a single century and is attributable to three industrial revolutions whose fruits have largely been exhausted (Gordon, 2016; Piketty, 2014) . Fred Hirsch suggested that once societies reach a certain level of wealth, individual success starts depending on one's advantageous positioning vis-\u00e0-vis others, making economic life a zero-sum game where individual achievement does not promote societal growth (Hirsch, 1978) . The persistent failure of developed countries to produce high growth despite historically low interest rates speaks to the relevance of these and similar analyses today.",

When Sherry Ortner conducted interviews with her class of 1958 classmates, she noted how central \"success\" was in their life-narratives. This class graduated a year after the \"Happy Days cohort,\" which Hauser studied (Hauser n.d.) ; they came of age in an era of expansion and defined themselves through the experience of going beyond their original class disposition (Ortner, 2003) . Compare this to the existential condition of millennials, who are predicted to be the first generation to earn less than their parents and whose chances of upward mobilization have declined to a mere 50% toss-up (Chetty et al., 2017) . The so-called millennial condition is defined by a struggle to preserve, not exceed, one's class disposition-to make do and hang onto the property and wealth that one's parents pass on (Lambek, 2015, p. 14; Zaloom, 2019) .",

            "text": "I make two propositions related to such situations. First, I suggest that sociologists should take such limits as outcomes of a social process, in which various actors make claims regarding the objectivity of certain limits and try to persuade others of the necessity to adjust policy, modes of governance, and human behavior accordingly. Claims for limits on progress should not be taken at face value. At certain times and by certain people, such claims may be endorsed as unquestionable truths, but in other cases they may be accepted as avertable or artificial problems. Consider, for example, Stanley Jevons's warning that the depletion of coal mines in the United Kingdom could bring the country's economic progress to a halt (Jevons, 1866) , and Paul Ehrlich's ominous prediction that population explosion would crowd out the planet's space and resources (Ehrlich, 1968 ). On hindsight, both claims can easily be dismissed-although the threat of the population bomb, which demographers largely agree has been exaggerated, still lurks behind the current environmental crisis (Lam, 2011 ). Yet at the time they were made, these claims referred to pertinent problems, which could be dismissed offhandedly only by adopting a metaphysical view of progress and asserting that human ingenuity and innovation would always surpass all limits and obstacles (Simon, 1996) . Like past claims on progress's limits, current predictions about environmental, economic, and scientific limits can be dismissed by resorting to general faith in progress, growth, and opportunity. Yet, as this article shows, alongside them we can also find widespread mobilizations and stances that revolve around the recognition of limits and the effort to enforce them: alongside growth in utilization and spending on life-prolonging care and medical technologies, we can see a rise in attempts to limit this growth; alongside the promise of economic opportunity and growth, we can find calls to focus on reallocating existing resources (Fitzpatrick, 2004) ; and alongside denials of global warming and blind faith in future and yet-to-be-invented technologies to solve the climate crisis, we see extensive (though so far failed) attempts to abide by environmental limits, reduce consumption, control production, and govern carbon emissions.",

Financial valuations of the environment (Fourcade, 2011) , as alternative valuations of national wealth that take environmental degradation into account (Constanza et al., 2014) , ascribe worth to the environment and by that bind and define what was previously indefinite. These and other valuation projects can mobilize people and institutions-for example, by developing tastes for environmentally friendly goods (Elliott, 2013) , adopting abstemious lifestyles that reject the riches of capitalism (Barnard, 2016) , or promoting environmental valuation schemes in rational calculations (MacKenzie, 2013) .

A nephrologist (kidney specialist) told me: Some cultures revere the elderly, and it's sort of like they are the anchor among a family unit, and some cultures or ethnicities tend to stay in the same geographic region because that's their nature, that's what they do. [\u2026] [So] the loss of the patriarch or matriarch can be [more] destabilizing [to] some families and ethnic backgrounds [\u2026].
