Susceptibility to conspiracy theories may be increased by dissociation: disintegration of experiences reducing awareness of intolerable information [6] . Belief in COVID-related conspiracy theories is predicted by cognitive reflection, the ability to reflect upon whether the result of an intuitive cognitive process is correct [7, 8] . Beliefs in generic conspiracy theories are predicted by bullshit receptivity, the ability to judge whether a statement was \"constructed absent direct concern for the truth\" [9] (p. 549), even when controlled for cognitive reflection [10] .",

For convenience, self-assessment questionnaires are often used, despite not being well-suited for interindividual comparisons [13] . In case respondents overestimate their digital health literacy, it may be especially relevant in those susceptible to conspiracy theories, as overestimating one's own explanations contributes to both the risk of inflating one's skills in a subjective health literacy questionnaire [13] and conspiratorial thinking [14] . Indeed, a meta-analysis revealed a mismatch between subjective and objective information literacy [15] and some studies led to counterintuitive results, such as a positive correlation between digital health literacy and conspiracy theories [16, 17] or a negative correlation between digital health literacy and vaccination compliance [18] . Because digital literacy should, by definition [19] , result in finding and applying health-related information in a way that helps to solve health problems, rather than increasing vulnerability to contagious diseases, we find these findings suspicious.",

We expect that high dissociative tendencies, low cognitive reflection and high bullshit receptivity will predict high conspiracy mentality (hypothesis 1), that high dissociative tendencies, low cognitive reflection, high bullshit receptivity and low digital health literacy will predict belief in conspiracy theories (hypothesis 2), that conspiracy mentality will mediate the link between dissociative tendencies, cognitive reflection and high bullshit receptivity on one side and belief in COVID-related conspiracies on the other (hypothesis 3) and that the effects of dissociation and digital health literacy on COVID-related conspiracy beliefs will interact (i.e., in the effect of dissociation will be even stronger in individuals with low digital health literacy; hypothesis 4). Further, we want to address possible bias in eHEALS results due to overestimation of skills during self-evaluation. Due to the difficulties inherent to measuring digital health literacy objectively [13] , we will examine this possibility through the effects of cognitive reflection and bullshit receptivity on the link between the eHEALS score and belief in conspiracy theories: We expect cognitive reflection (hypothesis 5) and bullshit receptivity (hypothesis 6) to moderate the link between digital health literacy measured by the self-reporting eHEALS questionnaire and belief in COVID-related conspiracy theories, indicating bias in the eHEALS results. If eHEALS is an unbiased measure of digital health literacy, neither of these characteristics should influence the relation between digital health literacy and belief in conspiracy theories: digital health literacy should predict lower belief in conspiracy theories related to health in people with low as well as high cognitive reflection and bullshit receptivity. However, eHEALS score may be inflated in people with low cognitive reflection (i.e., the respondents exaggerate their skills due to lack of awareness of their mistakes) or high bullshit receptivity (i.e., the respondents exaggerate their skills due to lack of ability to assess the actual quality of the information they trust). In such a case, cognitive reflection (and/or bullshit receptivity) will moderate the effect of eHEALS score on belief in conspiracy theories. Namely, in participants with low cognitive reflection (and/or high bullshit receptivity), the negative effect of digital health literacy on belief in health-related conspiracy theories will be weakened by the inflated eHEALS score.",

The resulting scores for both dimensions are the means of the scores for individual items (except for those reverse-scored). The Czech translation of the original scale was confirmed by back translation and the assessment of internal reliability has shown consistencies similar to those in the original study (Cronbach alpha = 0.88 for HOAX and Cronbach alpha = 0.67 for CREATED).",

Forced entry multiple linear regression analysis was used to evaluate the effect of the independent variables on conspiracy mentality and belief in specific conspiracy theories, using the function \"lm\" with its predefined parameters. For testing interactions, moderation analysis was used as described by Wu and Zumbo [24] . To evaluate whether a variable M might be moderating the effect of an independent variable I on a dependent variable D, I and D were centered, scaled and entered into a linear regression model as predictors of M. Then, a second model was created by entering the product of D and I into the first one, and the variance explained in both models was compared using ANOVA. A significant increase of variance explained by adding the product of the two predictors indicated a moderating effect of M. To examine the expected mediating effect of conspiracy mentality and belief in conspiracy theories, mediation analysis was used. After standardizing the data, the respective regression coefficients were calculated, using the \"mediate\" function, as described by Revelle [25] . Bootstrapping (5000 iterations) was used to estimate confidence intervals. The analysis was conducted in R 3.6.3 [26] , using the packages tidyverse [27] , psych [28] and QuantPsyc [29] .",

As depicted in Figure 1 , in those achieving above-average CRT score, high eHEALS predicted lower values of HOAX (\u03b2 = \u22120.24, p < 0.001), in those scoring below average in CRT, HOAX was not linearly dependent on eHEALS (\u03b2 = \u22120.05, p = 0.36). Given that the average HOAX score was below the middle answer (m = 0.24 on a scale ranging from 0 to 1), a moderating effect of CRT might result from inattention of participants: those achieving lower CRT score might have been answering the questionnaire with less care, being more likely to choose random answers on the HOAX scale, therefore increasing the HOAX scores independently of eHEALS. However, since the average eHEALS is, on the other hand, above the middle answer (m = 0.39 on a scale ranging from 1 to 5), such a group of participants with above-average HOAX scores and below-average eHEALS scores would rather strengthen than disrupt the negative correlation. Additionally, the reliabilities of eHEALS (Cronbach alpha = 0.91) and HOAX (Cronbach alpha = 0.89; including one reverse-scored answer) are almost identical in the group with lower CRT as in the whole sample.

The sample of university students may have influenced the effects of the scrutinized factors on the beliefs in conspiracy theories.

Considering our finding that the relationship between eHEALS score and belief in conspiracy theories depends on cognitive reflection, it should be further studied whether and to which extent subjective measures of digital health literacy may be affected by lack of cognitive reflection. Research should further address differences in predictors of different conspiracy theories. First, our data revealed a difference in the effect of bullshit receptivity on two conspiracy theories on a similar topic. Similarly, collective control was positively associated with most conspiracy beliefs about COVID-19, but negatively associated with those beliefs that blame the government in Poland [41] . Second, our data revealed that COVID-related conspiracy beliefs depend on psychological predictors less than general conspiracy mentality, perhaps because conspiracy beliefs about COVID-19 are influenced by situational variables (i.e., personal losses, attitudes to the institutions reacting to the crisis) more than conspiracy theories explaining distant events, such as the deaths of JF Kennedy or Princess Diana. Indeed, the effects of politically motivated reasoning on COVID-related conspiracy theories were larger compared to the effects of anxiety, desire for certainty or cognitive reasoning [2] , and national narcissism had a large effect on belief in various COVID-related conspiracy theories [42] . Further, variables related to political orientation as well as those related to education and access to information may explain belief in conspiracy theories about coronavirus to the same or higher extent as psychological constructs [43] , with institutional trust affecting COVID-related misbeliefs twice more than digital health literacy [12] , altogether warranting further research on the difference between psychological and political predictors of different conspiracy theories.",

Our data from Czech university students indicate that COVID-related conspiracy theories are linked to high dissociation tendencies, low cognitive reflection, low digital health literacy and, in part, high bullshit receptivity. At the same time, the predictors only explained 7-10% of the variance of COVID-related conspiracy theories and 16% of conspiracy mentality, suggesting that other, perhaps socio-political factors, may be needed to fully understand the origins of conspiracy theories. The effect of self-perceived digital health literacy on one of the conspiracy beliefs was only present in respondents with high cognitive reflection, indicating that self-perceived scales may inflate the level of digital health literacy in subjects with low cognitive reflection.
