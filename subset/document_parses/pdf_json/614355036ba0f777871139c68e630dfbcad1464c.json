There is currently insufficient data on serology assay performance beyond 35 days after symptoms onset. We aimed to evaluate SARS-CoV-2 antibody tests on three widely used platforms. A chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay (CMIA; Abbott Diagnostics, USA), a luminescence immunoassay (LIA; Diasorin, Italy), and an electrochemiluminescence immunoassay (ECLIA; Roche Diagnostics, Switzerland) were investigated. In a multigroup study, sensitivity was assessed in a group of participants with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 (n = 145), whereas specificity was determined in two groups of participants without evidence of COVID-19 (i.e., healthy blood donors, n = 191, and healthcare workers, n = 1002). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, multilevel likelihood ratios (LR), and positive (PPV) and negative (NPV) predictive values were characterized. Finally, analytical specificity was characterized in samples with evidence of the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) (n = 9), cytomegalovirus (CMV) (n = 7), and endemic common-cold coronavirus infections (n = 12) taken prior to the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. The diagnostic accuracy was comparable in all three assays (AUC 0.98). Using the manufacturers' cut-offs, the sensitivities were 90%, 95% confidence interval [84,94] (LIA), 93% [88,96] (CMIA), and 96% [91,98] (ECLIA). The Hindawi Disease Markers Volume 2021, Article ID 8810196, 13 pages https://doi.org/10.1155/2021/8810196 specificities were 99.5% [98.9,99.8] (CMIA), 99.7% [99.3,99.9] (LIA), and 99.9% [99.5,99.98] (ECLIA). The LR at half of the manufacturers' cut-offs were 60 (CMIA), 82 (LIA), and 575 (ECLIA) for positive and 0.043 (CMIA) and 0.035 (LIA, ECLIA) for negative results. ECLIA had higher PPV at low pretest probabilities than CMIA and LIA. No interference with EBV or CMV infection was observed, whereas endemic coronavirus in some cases provided signals in LIA and/or CMIA. Although the diagnostic accuracy of the three investigated assays is comparable, their performance in low-prevalence settings is different. Introducing gray zones at half of the manufacturers' cut-offs is suggested, especially for orthogonal testing approaches that use a second assay for confirmation.",

            "text": "COVID-19 is a recently emerging pandemic disease caused by infection with SARS-CoV-2 virus. Although there are considerable differences regarding its incidence, hospitalization rate, morbidity rate, and case fatality rate between different countries, disease control at the moment is uniformly achieved by strict prevention measures such as social distancing, wearing of face masks, hand-washing, contact tracing and testing, quarantine, or isolation [1] . Whereas the diagnosis of acute disease in the medical laboratory most importantly relies on RT-PCR testing, serological testing for antibodies specifically directed against viral proteins of SARS-CoV2 has increasingly come into the focus of public health authorities and medical institutions [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] . The clinical presentation of COVID-19 has been shown to be heterogeneous in severity as well as in clinical signs and symptoms [9] . A substantial proportion of patients have only minimal symptomatology or are even asymptomatic [10] . Currently, there is no vaccination available, and causal therapies are very limited [11] . After several countries showed success in confining the progression of the COVID-19 pandemic with drastic measures, there is a need to gradually cancel these measures to reinstitute possibly \"normal\" social and economic circumstances [12, 13] . To guide these actions to reverse socioeconomic lockdown, knowledge on the prevalence of COVID-19 is needed [14] . Since a large proportion of patients with suspected COVID-19 infection could not be tested by RT-PCR in the acute phase, serological testing may gain increasing importance for retrospective clarification of clinical symptoms [15] .",

It facilitates contact tracing as well as surveillance and assists in the identification of individuals susceptible to COVID-19 infection [2, 18, 19] . Furthermore, individuals having had contact with confirmed COVID-19 patients might be interested in determining whether they developed SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies, if they did not yet have access to testing. Moreover, serological testing allows us to clarify clinical cases in which RT-PCR testing has been negative despite a high pretest probability for the presence of COVID-19 [20, 21] . Such cases of false negative RT-PCR have been reported, possibly because of improper collection techniques, viral loads below the detectable limit of the assay, or diminished upper airway shedding of the virus [22] [23] [24] [25] . Finally, the role of specific antibodies in terms of protection against reinfection and persistence over time is currently not adequately defined.",

However, some of these tests have been criticized for poor sensitivity and specificity [27] . Poor specificity has been suspected to occur due to cross-reactivity with the antibody response to endemic coronaviruses causing the common cold (i.e., HCoV-229E, -NL63, -OC43 and -HKU1) [28] . Some of these cross-reacting antibodies, however, have actually shown neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV-2 [29] . Since the antibody response in SARS-CoV-2 infection needs 2 to 4 weeks to develop, false negative antibody tests can occur due to insufficient duration between the onset of clinical symptoms and the time of blood sampling or insensitive measurement techniques that require large quantities of antibodies for a positive result [6, 12] . At the moment, it is not known how long the antibody titers persist. A recent Cochrane review stated that there are currently not enough studies available for antibody tests done after 35 days of symptom onset [30] .",

Anonymized samples originating from four different types of patients were investigated with three CLIAs. The first group of patients was retrospectively assembled from Liechtenstein and Swiss patients having their laboratory evaluations sent to labormedizinisches zentrum Dr. Risch in Vaduz (Liechtenstein) and Buchs (Switzerland) and consisted of COVID-19 patients (mainly outpatients) whose serum was drawn after COVID-19 disease was confirmed by RT-PCR between March 2nd and April 23rd, 2020 (n = 145). This group was used for the determination of sensitivity. The method of RT-PCR measurement has been conducted as reported elsewhere [37] . The patients from Liechtenstein were prospectively and consecutively enrolled within a national COVID-19 cohort, whereas the Swiss patients consisted from a retrospectively assembled convenience sample, both detailed in references [37, 38] . The second group of individuals was prospectively assembled and consisted of consecutive healthy blood donors from the Blutspendedienst Graub\u00fcnden without clinical suspicion of COVID-19 providing blood for testing SARS-CoV2 antibodies from April 15th to May 4th, 2020 (n = 191). In addition to fulfilling the normal criteria of blood donation, these blood donors specifically responded they had had no had flu-like symptoms or contact with a known COVID-19 patient during the past 14 days. The third cohort was prospectively assembled within a study setting from the Kantonsspital St. Gallen and consisted of healthcare workers providing a blood sample for detecting SARS-CoV2 antibodies between March 19th and April 3rd, 2020 (n = 1002) as described elsewhere [39] . Hospital admissions in this region peaked in the second week of April 2020. The blood donors and the healthcare workers were used to determine specificity. Since these 2 groups did not have RT-PCR testing available, samples with at least two of the three chemiluminescence assays positive were excluded from this analysis, assuming that these individuals had occult SARS-CoV-2 infection. Such an orthogonal testing approach for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies has been reported to have a very high positive predictive value for COVID-19 and therefore is suited to reliably exclude individuals with recent COVID-19 infection [40] [41] [42] . Characteristics of the excluded 10 seropositive individuals among the healthcare workers are detailed elsewhere (i.e., 6 individuals had all three assays positive, 3 had CMIA and ECLIA positive, and one had CMIA and LIA positive) [ Whereas the cohort with healthcare workers provided written informed consent, informed consent for performing laboratory analysis on anonymized samples in the other three groups was waived.

We also applied alternative cut-offs (half and double of the manufacturers' cut-offs), in order to better understand the relationship between signal strength and associated diagnostic characteristics. Positive and negative likelihood ratios (LR) were calculated for the different cut-off levels [44] . Regarding interpretation of LR, it is generally acknowledged that a + LR > 10 as well as a -LR < 0:1 generates large and often conclusive changes from the pretest to the posttest probability. A +LR between 5 and 10 as well as a -LR between 0.1 and 0.2 generates moderate shifts from the pretest to the posttest probability, whereas a +LR between 2 and 5 and a -LR from 0.2 to 0.5 generate small but sometimes important changes from the pretest to the posttest probability [44] . Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves with the area under the curves (AUCs) were calculated as an indicator of diagnostic accuracy. The AUCs for the different parameters were compared by the method of Hanley and McNeil. Positive and negative predictive values for each of the employed assays were then plotted as a function of pretest probability, as described earlier [45] . Continuous variables are given as medians and interquartile ranges (IQRs), whereas proportions are given as percentages together with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Agreement between the two methods was assessed by Cohen's kappa. The associations between variables were calculated with Spearman's rank correlation. ",

Such a score based on clinical history taking would improve the interpretation of COVID-19 serology results, not least in a retrospective setting, where accurate laboratory results are not available because no blood has been drawn. However, there are several other proxies to assess pretest probabilities. In the Swiss and Liechtenstein setting, several situations can be described, in which the risk for patients to contract COVID-19 can be quantified [37] : 32% for household contacts, 13% of close working contacts, and 12-25% of patients with fever > 38\u00b0C and respiratory symptoms.

At half of the manufacturer's cut-off, past COVID-19 could be ruled out with a probability of 99% up to a pretest probability of 26% (CMIA) to 30% (LIA, ECLIA). These pretest probabilities are in the range of those observed in symptomatic individuals. Thus, serology done in patients with clinical symptoms three or more weeks before drawing blood together with manufacturers' and modified manufacturers' cut-offs can be considered safe to exclude COVID-19 disease. Nevertheless, serological nonresponders can occur with a frequency of approximately 3% and may go overlooked.

When taking the lower limit of the 95% CI of the specificity, i.e., 99.5%, the PPV at 1% pretest probability is 66%, and 91% at 5% pretest probability. We therefore recommend continuing with the confirmation of positive ECLIA results with a second assay [40] . Our data also show that at the manufacturer cut-offs, the CMIA and LIA need confirmatory testing in low pretest probability (<5%) settings. Otherwise, the risk of false positive results is larger than 5%. The problem of false positive results is that they can change the behavior of individuals in that they will not adhere to hygienic and distancing measures after the (false) positive result has been disclosed.

This example illustrates that the introduction of gray zones should be considered not only for ELISA but also for chemiluminescence immunoassays when offering SARS-CoV-2 testing to clinicians and public health professionals [53] . The fact that we found some cross-reactivity in patients with prior endemic coronaviruses raises the question whether this finding represents analytical cross-reactivity or reflects cross-reactive immunity conferred by recent endemic coronavirus disease. We did not conduct neutralization assays to clarify this issue. However, Ng and colleagues reported that patient sera from human coronaviruses variably reacted with SARS-CoV-2 S-antigen and nucleocapsid antigen, but not with the S1 subunit [29] . These patient sera exhibited neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV-2 S pseudotypes according to the levels of SARS-CoV-2 S-binding IgG and with efficiencies comparable to those of COVID-19 patient sera [29] . In our study, we had one case with a LIA signal (targeting S1-S2 antigen) and a CMIA signal (targeting nucleocapsid antigen) without a signal in the IgG ELISA (which is targeted against S1). This patient had his serum taken in September 2019 after infection with RCOC43 was diagnosed in January 2019. We are convinced that identifying patients with endemic coronaviruses with potential neutralizing cross-reactivity will be of increasing importance in the future. Whereas CMIA and LIA could play a role in identifying such individuals, ECLIA is not expected to help further in this aspect, as none of the patients with endemic coronavirus had a measurable antibody response. The measurements in the healthcare workers as well as in the blood donors suggest that such constellations do not occur often: 1147/1193 (i.e., 96.1 (95% CI [94.9,97.1])) have unmeasurable antibody titers in the LIA, whereas this frequency amounts to 921/1193 (i.e., 77.2% (95% CI [74.7,79.5])) in the CMIA.",

            "text": "Our study has strengths and limitations. A strength is that specificity has been assessed in a large group of 1193 individuals without evidence of COVID-19. Such an approach offers the possibility to describe the specificity with relatively narrow confidence intervals. A further strength is that we investigate several potential cut-offs for clinical decision making. A limitation of the study is that samples employed for evaluation of specificity were selected from contemporary and not prepandemic participants. Two positive serology results in an orthogonal testing approach cannot provide 100% certainty that any remaining false positives are truly false positive. Nevertheless, we demonstrate that a combination of two positive results with chemiluminescence assays has a very high positive predictive value even at low pretest probabilities, comparable to that known from molecular methods [42] . Further, inclusion of the index serology tests as part of the reference standard definition of absence of disease carries a risk of bias in results. At low pretest probabilities, such a bias might have a considerable impact on positive predictive values. There are several factors mitigating such a misinterpretation: (a) utilizing an orthogonal testing approach in initially positive results, (b) the fact that even in the first wave of COVID-19, COVID-19 prevalence in some regions of Europe was already more than 10%, which cannot be considered low [50] . The specificities identified in our study from contemporary samples are comparable to those obtained in a similar study on prepandemic samples [54] . The study is finally limited by the fact that we did not have a full clinical description of the COVID-19 patients included in this study, and patients hospitalized due to COVID-19 represented a minority of the COVID-19 patients. However, since the majority of patients subjected to serology will originate from the outpatient setting, we believe that this fact actually strengthens our findings. In sum, we think that the limitations do not invalidate our findings.",

We found that the diagnostic accuracy of the three investigated assays was comparable. Assay cut-offs have not been designed for orthogonal testing. Introducing gray zones at half of the manufacturers' cut-offs is suggested. These differentiated cut-offs would allow for safer ruling out or ruling in of past COVID-19 infections. Such an approach would allow us to more appropriately select samples for further testing in an independent assay in an orthogonal testing algorithm. We propose that our findings be replicated in other populations.",
