One mechanism by which this modulation is achieved is via angiotensinogen's Cys18-Cys138 disulfide bond that acts as a redox switch. Molecular dynamics simulations of each redox state of angiotensinogen reveal subtle dynamic differences between the reduced and oxidised forms, particularly at the N-terminus. Surface plasmon resonance data demonstrate that the two redox forms of angiotensinogen display different binding kinetics to an immobilised anti-angiotensinogen monoclonal antibody. Mass spectrometry mapped the epitope for the antibody to the N-terminal region of angiotensinogen. We therefore provide evidence that the different redox forms of angiotensinogen can be detected by an antibody-based detection method.",

In the first and rate-limiting step of this pathway, the endopeptidase renin cleaves angiotensinogen to release the decapeptide angiotensin(Ang)-I. Ang-I is then cleaved by angiotensinogen-converting enzyme (ACE) to create Ang-II [2] . This octapeptide can be further hydrolysed to Ang-(1-7) by membrane-bound angiotensinogen-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-II), a receptor that has recently received attention as an entry point for different corona viruses, including SARS-COV and SARS-COV2 (Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus) [3] . Ang-II activates angiotensin type I receptors (AT1R), leading to vasoconstriction and secretion of aldosterone. Aldosterone release results in sodium and water retention by the kidneys and a subsequent increase in blood pressure [4] .",

Typically circulating in the plasma at concentrations close to the K M of the renin-catalysed reaction [6] (\u223c0.9 nmol/ml), angiotensinogen levels positively correlate with blood pressure [7, 8] . In animal studies, blood pressure will decrease in response to an injection of antibodies specific to angiotensinogen [9] , and conversely, an increase in blood pressure is observed following administration of an injection of angiotensinogen [10] . Further to this, it has been demonstrated that transgenic mice expressing rat angiotensinogen display elevated blood pressure [11] . A polymorphism within the human angiotensinogen gene, resulting in an amino acid substitution at position 235 (M235T), has been shown to be significantly associated with both increased plasma angiotensinogen levels and hypertension [12] .",

Cysteine residues play crucial roles in the structure and stability of proteins, and as such disulfide bond formation due to the surrounding redox environment can trigger changes in protein structure and activity [14, 15] . Human angiotensinogen contains four cysteine residues but only Cys18 and Cys138, which form a disulfide bond under certain redox conditions, are conserved across species [12] . Angiotensinogen is oxidised in the endoplasmic reticulum and is subsequently secreted and reduced in the plasma, resulting in a consistent 60 : 40 ratio of the oxidised to reduced form in the circulation of healthy individuals, regardless of gender or age [13] . On incubation with renin in the presence of the (Pro)renin receptor, the oxidised form of angiotensinogen displays a four-fold increase in the catalytic release of Ang-I when compared with the reduced form of angiotensinogen [13] . The disulfide bond between Cys18 and Cys138 is crucial for constraining the N-terminus of angiotensinogen in order for the protein substrate to adopt a favourable conformation for reaction with renin [16, 17] .",

If we could reliably differentiate between the two redox forms of angiotensinogen this could represent a useful biomarker by which to monitor the progression of hypertensive disorders. With this in mind, we sought to probe the two redox states of angiotensinogen to gain a better understanding of the molecular structure of these intrinsically similar forms that differ only by the presence or absence of a disulfide bond. We hypothesised that, while the protein forms are likely to be structurally very similar, the dynamics of the two states may differ. Molecular dynamics simulations of each redox state of angiotensinogen reveal subtle dynamic differences between the reduced and oxidised forms, particularly at the N-terminus. To experimentally verify this in silico result, we demonstrate that the two redox forms of angiotensinogen display different binding kinetics to an immobilised anti-angiotensinogen monoclonal antibody by surface plasmon resonance and when we mapped the epitope for the antibody by mass spectrometry, we found that it binds to the N-terminal sequence of angiotensinogen. We therefore provide evidence that the different redox forms of angiotensinogen have altered dynamics and can be differentiated by an antibody-based detection method.",

Reduced AGT was prepared by overnight incubation with 2 mM DTT and PD-10 buffer exchange into PBST prior to the experiment. A dilution series of AGT with a dilution factor of two was prepared in PBST to give concentrations of 2 mM, 1 mM, 0.5 mM, 0.25 mM, 0.125 mM, and 0.0625 mM. A 409 ml injection of each AGT concentration, in descending order, was flowed simultaneously across separate channels on the chip in the analyte direction at a flow rate of 25 ml/min and allowed to associate with the anti-AGT mAb for a total contact time of 981 s. At the end of the injection, running buffer was flowed across all analyte channels for 1800 s (30 min) to allow dissociation. This was then followed with regeneration of the ligand surfacea 30 ml pulse of glycine HCl pH 2 for a total of 18 s at a flow rate of 100 ml/min to remove any non-dissociated analyte. At least four blank buffer injections were performed to allow the ligand to recover from regeneration and ensure a stable baseline was re-established. The order of the concentration series of AGT was then randomised and the interaction run was repeated such that each concentration was flowed across a different analyte channel to the previous interaction run. The procedure was carried out for both redox forms of AGT. Thus, a total of eight replicates for each of the reduced and oxidised forms of angiotensinogen at each concentration were measured (two replicates of four replicate ligand channels). The three highest concentrations of oxidised and reduced angiotensinogen were injected simultaneously across all ligand channels in the same run, first in an ordered fashion, and then in a randomised order, such that in each run oxidised angiotensinogen was flowed across three channels and reduced angiotensinogen was flowed across the other three channels.",

As shown in Figure 1B ,C, we observe differences in the fluctuations of the N-terminus, a helix (87-99), the CD loop (135-140, loop connecting helices C and D) and loops 160-170 and 404-419 (reactive centre loop). Interestingly the N-terminus of the oxidised form fluctuates to a higher degree compared with the reduced form; this may seem counter-intuitive given the presence of the disulfide bond in the oxidised form, however, it appears that the lack of a disulfide bond in the reduced form alters the conformational sampling of the N-terminus, with simulations showing a preference for the N-terminus to embed itself in the space where the disulfide bond would normally be ( Figure 1D,E) . Although the RMSF values of the A2 helices (residues 15-30) are very similar between oxidised and reduced angiotensinogen, we observed an overall reduction in secondary structure of this helix in the reduced form ( Figure 1F see the shift from green (helices) to red (random coil) for residues 22 onwards between oxidised (left) and reduced (right)). This is likely due to the lack of restraint from the Cys18-Cys138 disulfide bond, which in turn has a knock-on effect of increasing the flexibility of the CD loop.",

As shown in Figure 2B , both the k on and k off rate constants were different for the two redox forms, with oxidised angiotensinogen displaying a slower association rate and faster dissociation rate than reduced angiotensinogen (average k on of 1121 M \u22121 s \u22121 vs. 1510 M \u22121 s \u22121 and average k off of 1.78 \u00d7 10 \u22124 s \u22121 vs. 1.55 \u00d7 10 \u22124 s \u22121 , respectively).

For this we turned to surface plasmon resonance, a method that can provide binding insights through the elucidation of association and dissociation rate constants. We found that the two redox states of angiotensinogen exhibit different forms of binding to the same antibody. The reduced form shows higher k on and lower k off rates, resulting in a slightly lower K d , indicating tighter binding compared with the oxidised form. These results suggest that the monoclonal antibody binds to an epitope that is influenced by the redox state of angiotensinogen, but is still accessible in both redox forms.",

After initial identification of the region between residues 24-136, the binding to different short peptides covering this sequence showed antibody interactions to peptide 1 only, consisting of amino acids 24-35. This region is located in the flexible N-terminus that according to the crystal structure forms an extended, linear motif easily accessible on the surface of the protein.",
