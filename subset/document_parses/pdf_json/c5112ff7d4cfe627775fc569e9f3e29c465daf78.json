Facility-based products were given more trust in terms of quality as they are not produced with the notion of maximizing profit. Poor control of manufacturers by the country's regulatory body and issuing manufacturing license to non-pharmacy personnel might have a negative effect on quality of sanitizers especially with respect to the alcohol content. Relatively low cost (sometimes available for free) of in-house produced sanitizers is also indicated for their preference compared to those purchased from the market. Reports by other scholars also showed that sanitizers on the market are costly. For example, cost analysis from a case study conducted in Rwanda indicated a 71% financial savings while producing in-house ABHRs compared to those obtained from market [1, 7, 25, 30, 31] .",

Few of participants perceived that the compounding practice lack compliance to GCP due to lack of convenient compounding room, QC tests, sufficient manpower and equipment. Most of the participants believed that there is inappropriate use of both ABHR products and dispensing bottles in their facilities. Majority of the interviewees reported that compounding personnel had no in-service training on ABHR solution production. So, on job training on compounding of pharmaceuticals should be devised and delivered to pharmacy professionals engaged in compounding service. Regular monitoring and followup of the hospital compounding services is also recommended. Finally, supportive mechanisms including relevant incentives and reimbursements are suggested for compounding pharmacists. Moreover, integrating pharmacists and compounding pharmacists in particular, in the pandemic management team should be part of the national policy to mitigate this pandemic. ",
