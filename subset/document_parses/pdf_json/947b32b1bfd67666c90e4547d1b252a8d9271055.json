Psychological resilience and finding ways to cope in crises is a highly relevant topic considering the COVID-19 pandemic, which enforced quarantine, social distancing measures, and school closures worldwide. Parents and children are currently living with increased stress due to COVID-19. We need to respond with immediate ways to strengthen children's resilience. Internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy interventions for children's stress management overcome accessibility issues such as the inability to visit mental health experts owing to COVID-19 movement restrictions. An interactive learning environment was created, based on the preventive program \"Friends,\" to overcome accessibility issues associated with delivering cognitive behavioral therapy-based interventions in formal and informal education settings. Objective: This study aimed to examine the effectiveness of a web-based learning environment on resilience in (1) reducing anxiety symptoms and (2) increasing emotion recognition and recognition of stress management techniques among 9-10-year-old children. We also aimed to evaluate the learning environment's usability.",

Prevention programs have been carried out in different settings, including formal education and informal education settings [11] , and typically followed rigorous methodologies, including randomized controlled trials [12] . Cognitive behavioral therapy has therefore been demonstrated to be effective and is a well-established treatment for children and adolescents with anxiety disorders [3, 4, 13] .

Technology can eliminate some of these obstacles. One relatively new and increasingly popular approach of increasing access to treatment is the use of web-based intervention programs [29] . For example, internet-based CBT (iCBT) for children and adolescents is a persuasive system that combines three major components to therapy: therapeutic content, technological features, and interactions between the user and the program, intended to reduce users' anxiety symptoms [30] . According to a scoping review by Ashford et al [29] , the advantage of web-based approaches is the accessibility, affordability, and anonymity of potentially evidence-based treatment. In their meta-analysis including internet-based interventions for children, the youth, and young adults with anxiety, Ye et al [31] reported that these interventions could be effective in reducing the severity of symptoms in the youth and can further be considered comparable with conventional programs that have the same goal. Several studies that were based on CBT and targeted children [32] have reported positive results with respect to the effectiveness of internet-based interventions for children aged 7-13 years [33] , 9-14 years [34] , and younger children aged 4-11 years [35] . For example, March et al [26] demonstrated the efficacy, feasibility, and acceptability of a web-based, publicly available self-help iCBT for children and adolescents with anxiety by assessing program adherence and satisfaction and significant changes in anxiety.",

Fewer data exist for computer-based (standalone, self-help) and computer-assisted (in combination with face-to-face therapy or therapist-guided) programs for the youth [36] . Another problem is that relatively few web-based interventions on the world wide web have provided evidence of the intervention's efficacy, if we consider the treatment of anxiety as an example [29] , and these are not necessarily appropriate for children, as the majority of them mostly target an adult population. From the large number of web-based programs available on the internet and the large number of apps that can be downloaded on mobile phones and tablets [37] , only a few have been systematically tested and have published data on feasibility, acceptability, efficacy, and effectiveness [38] . For example, none of the mobile phone apps in previous studies [35, 36] on eHealth interventions for anxiety management targeting young children and adolescents had published data derived from trials that examined their efficacy. Lastly, Stiles-Shields et al [39] reviewed CBT-informed behavioral intervention technologies for youth with anxiety and reported that prevention interventions receive lesser attention than therapeutic interventions, and Tozzi et al [36] confirmed this finding in their review.",

The study initially showed that anxiety symptoms of participating students generally manifested at a low level in both the experimental and control groups, as prior to the intervention, all anxiety disorders that were examined, specifically separation anxiety, social phobia, OCD, panic agoraphobia, generalized anxiety, and fear of physical injury received low scores that did not exceed 1 on a scale ranging from 0 (\"never\") to 3 (\"always\"). This finding suggests that students, on average, \"sometimes\" experience symptoms associated with the aforementioned disorders. Despite low levels of reported anxiety symptoms before the intervention, there was a significant reduction in symptoms associated with OCD after the intervention in the experimental group, which indicates that the learning environment on resilience effectively reduced reported symptoms associated with OCD, especially since the students in the control group did not display a significant reduction in their scores. A comparison of pretest and posttest scores for the experimental group revealed a slight but nonsignificant reduction in the frequency of reported symptoms associated with disorders, such as separation anxiety, social phobia, generalized anxiety, and a fear of physical injury.",

During the pandemic, the youth have faced challenges associated with the loss of face-to-face social interaction [52] . According to Ye [2] , psychological crises often cause children to have feelings of abandonment, despair, incapacity, and exhaustion and even raise the risk of suicide. Children with mental illnesses are especially vulnerable during the quarantine and social distancing period. Even though the world has been struggling to curb the influences of the pandemic, quarantine and social distancing policies will have long-term impacts on children [2] . Therefore, according to Ye [2] , innovative digital solutions and informatics tools are needed more than ever to mitigate the negative consequences on children. March et al [26] reported that web-based self-help CBT might offer a feasible and acceptable first step for delivering mental health care services to children and adolescents with anxiety. Accordingly, the interactive learning environment on resilience that was described and evaluated in our study is an example of a digital solution toward this direction. As revealed by research question 1, the learning environment was found to be effective in reducing anxiety symptoms of OCD, at least based on children's self-reports; moreover, the learning environment effectively supported children in identifying stress symptoms and in recalling stress management techniques through a web-based intervention with minimal guidance from a teacher or mental health expert.",

Their review included several types of interactive technologies used in resilience interventions, such as serious video games, virtual reality simulations, social robots, and commercial off-the-shelf video games. Their review did not, however, include web-based interactive learning environments. Our study shows that interactive learning environments seem to have the potential to deliver resilience interventions in formal education settings in an accessible and user-friendly manner as well, as revealed by our usability findings. Children in this study were assisted by an adult to a very small extent as they mostly navigated through the learning environment using headphones at their own pace and individually responded to web-based questions. The proposed resilience intervention can potentially be accessible beyond the classroom's confined environment for providing support to children anywhere and anytime, with a smaller need for support by adults. This would allow for children's individual, independent use of the intervention at their own pace at school or at home. The web-based learning environment on resilience can be a useful and empirically validated digital resource for parents to use with their children at home or for teachers to use in classes conducted on the internet to focus on their mental health, which can be delivered either synchronously or asynchronously.",
