Many human pathological conditions including viral infections, autoimmune diseases and aging are recognized drivers of increased risk of CVD. Among viral infections, Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection is a contributing risk element to the existing traditional risk factors of atherogenesis; Influenza infection is correlated with increased the risk of cardiovascular events leading to deaths and HIV infection is an independent predictor of cardiovascular risk. The pandemic of SARS-COV2 infection showed that the severe presentation of the disease manifests with vascular damage and cardiovascular events. Autoimmune and chronic inflammatory diseases, including systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and psoriatic disease are also associated with cardiovascular disease. Lastly, in adults over 65 years, the accumulation of age-related phenotypic and functional alterations in immune cells parallels with a decline of the cardiovascular system with an increased incidence of cardiovascular disease.",

This article highlights the dual role of platelets in promoting both pro-and anti-inflammatory processes and underlines their capability to interact with leukocytes and endothelial cells. They discuss that this mechanism contributes to systemic inflammation by favoring the arrest of leukocytes on endothelium, the production of inflammatory cytokines and NETs formation. On the other hand, the binding of PLTs to leukocytes decreases the inflammatory response, participating in the resolution of thrombo-inflammation.

Particularly, extracellular ATP is an important activator of NLRP3 inflammasome, and the lack of the purinergic receptor P2X7 (P2 receptor) signaling in mouse model of atherosclerosis showed decreased disease development.

The homeostasis, maintenance and repair of endothelial cells is mediated in part by bone marrow-derived endothelial cell progenitors and other cell progenitors from the hematopoietic origin participate in this process. In addition, a subset of T cells, angiogenic T cells (T angs ) can support the proliferation and differentiation of endothelial progenitor cells. In this manuscript, Zhu et al. investigated the role of HIV driven immune activation in the process of endothelial repair. They found two subsets of circulating progenitors LIN4 -CD45 -CD34 + and LIN4 -CD45 dim CD34 + in PWH, and showed that the phenotype but not frequencies was associated with biomarkers of inflammation.

Accordingly, in rheumatoid arthritis, CD4 and CD8 T EM cells are expanded and correlate with coronary artery calcification. In addition, expansion of CD4 + CD28 -T cells are observed in these patients with preclinical atherosclerosis. Th17 subset on the other hand, is likely to play a major role in linking CVD and atherosclerosis in psoriasis.

Through the secretion of proangiogenic factors T ang cells exert a critical role in the formation of colonies of endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) as well as in their differentiation and function with a resulting protective role in the context of CVD. Within T ang subset, in SLE patients, there was a significant expansion of a subpopulation with immunosenescent characteristics such as the loss of the costimulatory molecule CD28, required for T cell activation, survival and proliferation. This exhausted subset of T ang correlated with SLE disease activity index-and was inversely related to T ang cells percentage.

In a murine model of atherosclerosis (ApoE -/-) immunized with the mouse orthologue of LL-37, mCRAMP, they present evidence of role of LL-37 reactive T cells in the pathology of the disease. LL-37 is a major driver in the initial phase of psoriasis pathogenesis and a target of self-reactive T cells identified in patients. LL-37 is also present in human atherosclerotic plaques, and it associates with platelet activation and induction of thrombosis. Therefore, the authors investigated these molecules as a potential linker between the innate immunity activation in chronic inflammation with autoreactive T cell generation and cardiovascular disease. The study shows that LL-37 stimulation of PBMCs from patients with acute coronary syndrome induced the persistence of CD8 T EM cell response compared to PBMCs from patients with stable coronary artery disease. However, in ApoE deficient mouse, adoptive transfer of T cells from mice immunized with mouse orthologue of LL-37 mCRAMP was associated with smaller atherosclerotic aortic plaque area and absence of aortic sinus plaque calcification. This work represents a starting point of an interesting future perspective that could reveal key aspects of the mechanistic link between DAMP-mediated priming of a chronic inflammatory/autoreactive response and cardiovascular events.",

Using a xenograft mouse model this study elegantly shows that human na\u00efve CD4 T cells, when transferred to immune-depleted mice, undergo homeostatic proliferation and differentiation of effector cells. Together with the accumulation of differentiated and terminally differentiated CD4 T cells, the authors observed an increase of effector CD4 T cell infiltration, monocytes, macrophages and dendritic cells infiltrating the myocardium, a phenotype that recapitulates age-related changes in elderly individuals. This interesting study suggests that the age-related accumulation of terminally differentiated CD4 T cells could play a critical role in promoting myocardial alterations in the aging human heart. However, while trying to understand the interconnection and influence of the age-related changes of the immune system with the incidence and prevalence of cardiovascular diseases in the elderly, we should be mindful of the high heterogeneity that exists among all studies focusing on immune system aging. To better understand this limitation, Rodriguez et al. performed a meta-analysis to determine the best set of markers to define immunosenescent cells. Strikingly, they observed that the lack of consensus not only on markers, but also on techniques and the high risk of bias did not allow for the identification of this \"validated\" phenotype. This result strongly suggests that active efforts towards identifying standard operating procedures (SOPs) are needed if we ever want to understand such a complex process as it is the aging of the immune system and its crucial role in the aging process of all other systems, including cardiovascular aging.",

While the pathogenesis of these human diseases is unique, the integrated view provided in this collection of manuscripts delineate common features linking T cell activation and increased CVD risk. Several CD4 and CD8 T cell subsets seems to be involved participating in the disease pathology promoting endothelial inflammation and injury, progression of atherosclerotic plaques and infiltration of myocardium. Distinct subsets of T cells including CD4 T EM cells with Th1 function and those with a CD4 + CD28 null T cell phenotype have been described. T cells producing IFNg and proinflammatory cytokines, and cytotoxic function are shown to be expanded in patients with CVD in lupus and other diseases and correlated with disease severity. The CD8 T cell subset is also involved and its role appears to be relevant in advanced phases of CVD such as atherosclerosis, in which CD8 T cells are present mainly in fibrous cap areas at higher number than CD4 T cells. These T cells have cytotoxic activity and secrete proinflammatory cytokines driving the progression and instability of the lesions. Finally, the emerging role of T cells in vasculogenesis highlights another important function of T cells. This angiogenic T cell subset or T ang subpopulation is enlightened as it is involved in vascular repair processes promoting new vessel formation, and new insights are provided into their role in pathogenesis or vascular disease. In addition, T helper cells expressing AHR, a putative sensor for environmental and metabolic stressors emerge as a potential subset that could link metabolic dysregulation with systemic chronic systemic inflammation in patients with Type-2 diabetes (T2D) and metabolically healthy obesity (MHO).",
