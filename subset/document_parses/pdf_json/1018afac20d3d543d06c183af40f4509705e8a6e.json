Along this line of research, temporal network has come out to be one of the most promising network platforms to investigate. Especially, such network with spatially moving agents has been established to be capable of modelling a number of practical instances. In this paper, we examine the dynamical outcomes of moving agents interacting based upon their physical proximity. For this, we particularly emphasize on the impact of competing interactions among the agents depending on their physical distance. We specifically assume attractive coupling between agents which are staying apart from each other, whereas we adopt repulsive interaction for agents that are sufficiently close in space. With this set-up, we consider two types of coupling configurations, symmetry-breaking and symmetry-preserving couplings. We encounter variants of collective dynamics ranging from synchronization, inhomogeneous small oscillation to cluster state and extreme events while changing the attractive and repulsive coupling strengths. We have been able to map all these dynamical behaviors in the coupling parameter space. Complete synchronization being the most desired state in absence of repulsive coupling, we present an analytical study for this scenario that agrees well with the numerical results.",

            "text": "C OMPLEX network [1] , [2] is the unifying paradigm behind many scientific disciplines ranging from physics, mathematics to computer science and biology. Besides the study related to local and global statistical properties of complex networks [3] , researchers are equally interested in paying attention to the dynamics of their interacting units [4] . Among those collective dynamics, a widely studied phenomenon is that of synchronization [5] , [6] , [7] , [8] , [9] , [10] , [11] , [12] of coupled oscillators arranged over the constituents of complex networks. Although, in recent times, there have been attempts in examining synchronizability of time-varying networks with different underlying structural arrangements, in most of these studies of synchronization, the nodes of the complex networks are spatially static. But, in real world networks, the individuals (nodes) move around and exchange information within close proximity. Such nodes in the contextual literature are well known as mobile agents [13] , [14] , [15] , [16] , [17] , [18] , [19] , [20] , [21] referring to those nodes whose movement highly influence the systems' collective dynamics. But, in general, the states of those oscillators situated on top of those agents do not affect the agents' mobility. The studies on the process of synchronization in mobile agents [22] , [23] , [24] , [25] , [26] , [27] , [28] have, so far, primarily concentrated on those particular cases when the mobile agents interact with each other only when they are closed enough in space. But, in all of these studies, the network architecture, i.e., how the oscillators are connected with each other, depends only on the attractive interaction. So, a basic query arises that how is the flow of information gets affected when different types of interactions are present in the movement. For instance, an attempt to answer this question can be made while incorporating repulsive coupling with the attractive one in such a networked system. Such co-existing dynamical interactions can be observed in a variety of systems and have been studied previously in different network setups yielding diverse collective states [29] , [30] , [31] , [32] , [33] .",

            "text": "Synergy of attractive-repulsive coupling can lead to several interesting dynamical behaviors. One of such example is the emergence of solitary states in multiplex networks [34] possessing positive inter-layer and negative intra-layer interactions. Earlier, Maistrenko et al. [35] found a variety of stationary states in networks of globally coupled identical oscillators with attractive and repulsive interactions. Sathiyadevi et al. [36] , [37] found diverse chimera states due to the introduction of nonlocal repulsive coupling together with an attractive coupling in a network of coupled oscillators. Also, interplay between conformists and contrarians leads to traveling wave along with the stationary states [38] . The effect of competitive interactions on the synchronization manifold among globally coupled identical Van der Pol oscillators through their velocities is rigorously addressed in ref. [39] . Even, the presence of a tiny fraction of repulsive couplings is found to enhance the synchronization of nonidentical dynamical units that are attractively coupled in a small-world network [40] . Origination of dragon-king-like extreme events as a result of the coexistence of excitatory and inhibitory chemical synaptic couplings is reported in the ref. [41] . Besides emergent dynamical patterns, co-presence of attractive and repulsive couplings carry high significance to several biological [42] , physical [43] , ecological [44] and even social scenarios [45] .",

This article describes such a system of attractively coupled oscillators with negative links as frustrated networks [47] . Such frustrated systems under the influence of attractive-repulsive co-existing interactions may induce unanticipated phenomenon, like extreme events [48] . Most of the existing articles [41] , [49] , [50] , [51] , [52] on extreme events in dynamical systems and networks define such an event as rare event. Mathematically, a rare event is defined on a probability space \u03c7 equipped with a \u03c3-algebra B of events such that P (A) is small, where P is the probability measure designed to quantify the probability of the occurrence of any event A \u2208 B. But, extreme events can be rare events [53] , [54] , [55] , or they can often be frequent in time and space [56] , [57] , [58] , [59] . Examples of such intermittent frequent extreme events include population size of Paris [60] , the bubbling of share market [61] before a crash and many more.",

Financial and commodity market crashes, tsunamis, hurricanes, floods, epidemic disease spread, global warming-related changes in climate and weather, warfare and related forms of violent conflict, asteroid impacts, solar flares, acts of terrorism, industrial accidents, 8.0+ Richter magnitude earthquake are few examples of such large impact events. In dynamical systems, researchers are recently starting to measure the impact of such events in terms of the amount of variation from the central tendency of that observable [41] , [49] , [51] , [62] , [63] , [64] . So, if \u03c8 is the observable defined on the state space U to R, then the extreme events are members of the set {u \u2208 U : \u03c8(u) > H S }, where H S = m + d\u03c3 with d is the non-zero integer. Here, m and \u03c3 are respectively the mean value and the standard deviation of all the peak values in a time series of u. But, if H S is too large, there will be very few values to model the tail of the distribution correctly as the variance is likely to be large due to only very extreme observations remaining. On the other hand, a low threshold value of H S will include too many values giving a high bias. Recently, m+8\u03c3 is found to appropriate indicating extreme event threshold for Weibull distribution [65] .",

Earlier all studies [22] , [23] , [25] , [27] , [28] , [65] , [66] related to mobile agents, considered only limited local interactions. Instead, we consider here a global network of mobile agents with co-existing switching interactions. Depending solely on the relative distance between the agents, attractive or repulsive interaction is activated. Specifically, we choose attractive interaction between those agents which are staying apart from each other, while we consider repulsive coupling for the agents that are sufficiently close. We consider two types of coupling schemes, namely symmetry-breaking and symmetry-preserving couplings. Under this set up, we explore the effect of coupling strengths which reveal quite interesting phenomena like cluster synchronization [67] , complete synchronization, inhomogeneous small oscillation, extreme events etc. We also analytically derive the critical coupling strength for achieving complete synchronization using time-average Laplacian matrix in absence of repulsive interaction and numerically verify the results.",

Notably, this density dependent threshold for the emergence of synchrony is found to be relevant and is of practical interest, particularly in the studies of the bacterial infection, biofilm formation and bioluminescence where quorum-sensing transition is observed in indirectly coupled systems [71] , [72] .",

After the initial transient, the x i of trajectories of the sets U and V converge respectively to two different trajectories as shown in Figs. 4(a, b) for k A = 1.0. Both the sets U and V contain 50 oscillators. The global network evolves into two equipotent subsets of oscillators in which members of the same cluster are synchronized to the same trajectory, but members of different clusters, oscillating with different small amplitudes. Notice that the oscillators that start with negative x i as per relation (5) Such partial synchronization may show up in swarms of unmanned autonomous vehicles, power grids and swarms of animals [75] . This interesting phenomenon is also hold for random initial 1] . But, in that case, the cardinality of U and V vary significantly in each realization. We also find that, if we increase k A by keeping fixed the initial conditions as per the relation (5), still we do not observe complete synchronization for k A \u2265 0.19. They still show cluster synchronization for suitable k A . However, for smaller suitable k A , the trajectories exhibit complete synchronization converging to a single periodic attractor.

We find that there exists a N critical , beyond which network shows such inhomogeneous small oscillation. Numerically, we find this N critical is 51. For N \u2265 52, such chaotic small oscillation is observed. For N < 52, the attractors are converged to a single attractor and the trajectories are exhibiting periodic behavior. In Fig. 5(b) , we plot the x i 's of all N = 51 oscillators, which are oscillating synchronously. To scrutinize the effect of k R , we fix the attractive coupling k A = 1.0, and slowly increase the absolute magnitude of k R . We observe that with increment of k R , the amplitude of the oscillators increase. After a certain value of k R , the attractors of one group, which are initially separated by the axes (See Fig. 5(a) ), are crossing the axes frequently. The trajectory of i-th oscillator crosses the axes and joins the other group for sometimes, before it comes back to its original group. To illustrate this, we choose randomly an agent from N = 100 oscillators, and plot its time series in Fig. 5(c) . The corresponding attractor is also shown in Fig. 5 (d) to demonstrate the chaotic switching behavior of the attractor. Interestingly, further slight increment of k R leads to complete synchronization. At k R = \u22120.28, all N = 100 oscillators oscillate synchronously and re-gain their isolated periodic dynamics. They oscillate in the limit cycle regime from [\u22121, 1].",

This type of intermittent error, the trajectories experiencing non-uniform, uncertain extensive expeditions from the synchronous manifold and can be considered as an appropriate candidate for extreme events. Earlier, local instability of synchronization manifold due to on-off intermittency causing extreme events in a pair of coupled chaotic electronic circuits is reported [81] . Also, Nag Chowdhury et al. [65] found a similar mechanism for the generation of extreme events in a mobile network of chaotic oscillators. To further resolve whether the spikes in Fig. 6 qualify for extreme events or not, we determine the local maximum values E n of E and plot the histogram for the event sizes E n in Fig.  7 . Note that the length of the collected time series is sufficient enough so that due to statistical regularity, inclusion of new sample does not affect the structure of the histogram. Pisarchik et al. [82] pointed out a special characteristic of extreme events, which is the L-shaped probability density function (PDF) of E n in the semilog scale. In spirit of all these facts, we define extreme events in this article as follows, 1) These short lasting events are recurrent, aperiodic and of different amplitudes higher than the significant height H S = m + 8\u03c3. In order to further eliminate the small amplitude events, another restriction is maintained, H S > 0.01 is taken along with H S = m+8\u03c3 [65] , [82] . 2) They appear much more often than Gaussian statistics and they are unpredictable almost surely with respect to time, where an event is defined as almost surely if the set of possible exceptions may be non-empty but has zero Lebesgue measure [83] .",

As per this Fig. 8 , whenever k A reaches to 0.5, then the introduction of small k R < 0.0 may destroy the limit cycle behavior of the oscillators and their synchronized behavior is also lost. The reflected region of inhomogeneous small oscillation enlarges with further increment of positive coupling k A . Interestingly, for a fixed k A \u2265 0.5, the decrement of k R helps to restore the periodic behavior of the attractors. With suitable choices of k R for fixed k A \u2265 0.5, this transition from inhomogeneous small oscillation to complete synchronized state occurs through the path of attractor switching, as already shown in Fig. 5 . The attractors are quenched and with further decrement of k R for appropriate k A , the trajectories switch between the co-existing attractors and finally regain their respective periodic synchronized attractor. When k R is further decreased, the synchronization error E becomes intermittent and reveals occasional away journey from the synchronization manifold. This regime is depicted through the red and blue regions in the Fig. (8) . In order to distinguish between these red and blue regions, we calculate the significant height H S . When H S lies within (10 \u22126 , 0.01], we label those states as the intermittent region (in red).

Hence, during those time, the error trajectory leaves the equilibrium point E = 0.0 (the synchronization manifold) and exhibit a large excursion exceeding H S = m + 8\u03c3. This choice of H S is influenced by the Ref. [65] , where the authors gave analytical logic behind the choice of such extreme event indicating threshold.

We depict the dynamical outcomes through Fig. 9 in which the phase diagram in the k R \u2212 k A parameter plane is portrayed. As can be seen from the figure, the presence of only attractive coupling readily induces complete synchronization in the system. Moreover, in contrast to our earlier observation for symmetry-breaking coupling (cf. Fig.   8 ), this synchrony sustains as k A increases. This is mainly because now the coupling function does not allow to break the symmetry yielding inhomogeneous small oscillation. On the other hand, switching the repulsive coupling strength k R on, one observes occasional jumps in the error dynamics (for suitable strengths of couplings) that indicates the appearance of intermittent states. More importantly, further increment of k R leads to the intermittent states that satisfy the criteria of being considered as extreme events. This result demonstrates that our observations of complete synchronization or the extreme events on the considered network set-up is not limited to a specific choice of symmetry-breaking coupling function.",

Further reduction of repulsive strength helps to regain their periodic behavior through the path of attractor switching. Moreover, further lessening leaves the error dynamics intermittent. This irregular away journey of error trajectory from the synchronization manifold gives rise to infrequent large deviated events. Using few characterizations, we confirmed these states as extreme events. The mean return interval of these extreme events is approximated using time series analogs of Kac's lemma in relation (12) . This relation indicates the dependency of average return interval R H S on the threshold H S . The larger R H S clearly corresponds to larger H S and vice-versa.
