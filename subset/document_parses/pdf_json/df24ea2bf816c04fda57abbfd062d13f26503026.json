Unlike traditional work patterns, this approach has limitations and has had a significant impact on both organizations and individuals. It also brings many challenges to the work of HR practitioners. HR practitioners, as key players in strategic human resource management, need to take advantage of management innovations under the crisis to improve employees' work flexibility and effectively address the impact of working from home. This study aims to address the need for employee skill improvement, psychological stress relief, work-family balance, and company culture reinforcement from an HRM perspective because of the impact of WFH work patterns during the COVID-19 crisis.",

Governments imposed total lockdown, banning non-essential travel, and requiring the closure of all non-essential activities. The strict government control measures led to many inconvenient working conditions. Traditional ways of working encountered serious challenges. The impact of COVID-19 on the global economy was similar to that of the 2008 crisis, although its long-term consequences were more severe. The impact on company performance is more pronounced in heavily impacted areas and industries, such as education and healthcare. We need to adopt a temporary COVID-19 strategy with companies responding quickly (Ahlstrom and Wang, 2020) . Many companies have opted for flexible work practices, such as working from home to reduce the spread of disease and losses. During the COVID-19 crisis, most people were already using online commerce as well as work from home (WFH) and digital businesses. In response to the outbreak of the crisis, work patterns changed and the WFH model grew rapidly (Zou et al., 2020b) . However, with the rise of WFH, its corresponding side effects emerged.",

From the division of these four concepts, it can be seen that the fit between the individual and the work environment should not only be in harmony with the organization at the macro-level, but also harmony with the work team at the micro-level, and most importantly, with one's work (Cable and Derue, 2002; Ahmad, 2012) .",

As a result, employees are faced with corresponding challenges and problems: First, the model requires upgrading employees' WFH work skills. This demand for WFH is driving the digitization of human work at an alarming rate due to the explosion of Frontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 4 September 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 710517 COVID-19 (Savi, 2020) . Employees need to work and communicate online, which requires special skills, such as new office skills and online communication skills. However, some specific industries, such as low-skilled services, cannot adopt this model. In addition, network accessibility and online task suitability can affect the feasibility of the model. Second, internal psychological stress. Research has shown that a lack of social support and the feeling of working alone can lead to loneliness (Rook, 1985) , and also to stress (Liu and Guo, 2007) . Some individuals are more stressed during a pandemic because they are unable to communicate their anxiety to others. In addition, with uncertainty about the future, such as layoffs, pay cuts, and bankruptcies, employees experience a serious increase in internal stress. Further studies also found that employees' psychological stress also has a direct negative impact on hiring commitment (Ali and Kakakhel, 2013; Velnampy and Aravinthan, 2013) .",

Their work style is flexible so they have unlimited access to online offices (Song and Gao, 2020) ; this model also breaks down the boundaries between work and non-work. It reduces the company's need for office space but increases the employees' need for living space because of the need for extra rooms to WFH (Behrens et al., 2021) . In addition, when some employees need to take care of their families, their families may stay at home while they are working (Kara et al., 2021) .

Unlike traditional office work, this model reduces opportunities for intimate psychological interactions while reducing face-toface communication.

Non-traditional WFH has a high degree of flexibility in terms of work schedule, which is different from traditional work hours. When developing WFH policies, HR practitioners should fully consider the individual preferences of WFH employees, based on the different characteristics of WFH employees (Golden, 2012) .

Virtual online HR management is required to complete recruitment and staffing; unlike office workflow, HR practitioners need to optimize job responsibilities and workflow for employees working from home; and the impact of the crisis has led to a more popular relationshiporiented HR system.

To prevent the future spread of this pandemic, many organizations have had to change their traditional ways of working. The advent of WFH has brought some convenience, but as the impact of the pandemic has deepened, it has also had certain effects on organizations, employees, and HR practitioners that will continue in the postpandemic era. Through a discussion of the relevant literature, this study argues that during the COVID-19 crisis, when people were working from home, our managers, especially HR practitioners, needed to address issues, such as job skills enhancement, employee stress under the crisis, work-family imbalance, and corporate culture reinforcement. Focusing on these issues has benefits for both organizations and individuals, especially in the current crisis. Future research will also need to consider the implications of this work model in the post-COVID-19 era.",
