            "text": "Our previous study demonstrated that azithromycin could promote alternatively activated (M2) macrophages under lupus conditions in vitro, which might be beneficial for lupus treatment. Thus, the aim of this study was to further confirm whether azithromycin can drive M2 polarisation in lupus and ultimately alleviate systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in vivo. Lymphocyte-derived DNA (ALD-DNA)-induced mice (induced lupus model) and MRL-Fas lpr mice (spontaneous lupus model) were both used in the experiment. First, we observed symptoms of lupus by assessing the levels of serum anti-dsDNA antibodies and serum creatinine and renal pathology. We found that both murine models showed increased levels of serum anti-dsDNA antibodies and creatinine, enhanced glomerular fibrosis and cell infiltration, basement membrane thickening and elevated IgG deposition. After azithromycin treatment, all these medical indexes were alleviated, and kidney damage was effectively reversed. Next, macrophage polarisation was assessed in the spleen and kidneys. Macrophage infiltration in the spleen was notably decreased after azithromycin treatment in both murine models, with a remarkably elevated proportion of M2 macrophages. In addition, the expression of interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6, tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), CD86, toll-like receptor (TLR)2 and TLR4 was extremely downregulated, while the expression of transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03b2, arginase-1 (Arg-1), chitinase-like 3 (Ym-1), found in inflammatory zone (Fizz-1) and mannose receptor (CD206) was significantly upregulated in the kidneys after azithromycin treatment. Taken together, our results indicated for the first time that azithromycin could alleviate lupus by promoting M2 polarisation in vivo. These findings exploited the newly discovered potential of azithromycin, a conventional drug with verified safety, affordability and global availability, which could be a novel treat-to-target strategy for SLE via macrophage modulation.",

Activated macrophages are categorised into two main subsets: the proinflammatory subset (classically activated macrophages, M1) and the anti-inflammatory subset (alternatively activated macrophages, M2) 9, 10 . Recent studies have highlighted the imbalance in macrophage polarisation between the M1 and M2 phenotypes in SLE. Compared with those from healthy controls, monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) from SLE patients triggered by apoptotic cells show an increased proinflammatory (M1-like) profile 11 . During outbreaks of lupus nephritis in SLE model mice, macrophages in the kidneys are dramatically skewed toward the M1 phenotype rather than the M2 phenotype 12, 13 . Thus, therapies targeting macrophage polarisation are promising for SLE treatment.",

AZM has been verified to have a long halflife and good record of safety and is consistently being developed for new uses, including as a potential candidate treatment for Corona Virus Disease (COVID)- 19 (refs. 14,15 ). A growing number of studies have shown that AZM can improve cystic fibrosis, spinal cord injury and pulmonary diseases by promoting M2 polarisation [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] . Therefore, we hypothesised that AZM can alleviate SLE by driving M2 polarisation. Our previous study demonstrated that AZM could promote an alternatively activated macrophage phenotype in SLE in vitro via the PI3K/Akt signalling pathway 21 .

As a lupusprone mouse model, MRL-Fas lpr mice showed elevated levels of anti-dsDNA antibodies (27, 929 .48 \u00b1 2626.56 mU/ ml, p = 0.038) and serum creatinine (174.33 \u00b1 81.31 \u03bcmol/ L, p = 0.020) at the end point. However, after AZM treatment, there was a slowdown in the upward trend of anti-dsDNA antibody levels, with a maximum of 18 439.23 \u00b1 4699.32 mU/ml, and the level of serum creatinine was extremely decreased (Fig. 5A ). To confirm whether the serological status reflected pathologic findings, we examined mouse kidneys microscopically. We found that MRL-Fas lpr mice suffered great renal damage characterised by relatively high inflammatory infiltration, renal tubular swelling, interstitial congestion, glomerulofibrosis, IgG deposition and glomerular basement membrane thickening. As expected, AZM effectively reversed this kidney damage (Fig. 5B-E) .",

The ALD-DNA lupus mouse model was first established by Qiao and has since been applied in several lupus-related studies 33, 34 . We found no significant difference in serum anti-dsDNA antibody levels among all groups at the initial time point. However, the level of serum anti-dsDNA antibodies was extremely elevated at 12 weeks after ALD-DNA immunisation in the ALD-DNA group, which was consistent with the previous observation by Qiao et al. As serum anti-dsDNA antibodies are the specific Fig. 2 Azithromycin alleviated the serum levels of anti-dsDNA antibodies and creatinine in ALD-DNA-induced murine lupus in vivo. A.The serum level of anti-dsDNA antibodies was extremely higher in the ALD-DNA group than in the normal control group. The level was decreased after azithromycin treatment but was still higher than that in the normal controls. B The level of serum creatinine was largely increased and peaked at the 8th week in the ALD-DNA group but only slightly elevated in the azithromycin group. C There were no significant changes in ALT or AST among all groups. N = 4, *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001. Fig. 4 Azithromycin promoted M2 polarisation in ALD-DNA-induced murine lupus in vivo. A Macrophage infiltration was significantly increased in the ALD-DNA group but decreased after azithromycin treatment. B, C The proportion of F4/80 + CD80 + cells (M1) was increased in the ALD-DNA group compared with the normal control group and reduced after azithromycin treatment (B), while the proportion of F4/80 + CD206 + cells (M2) was decreased in the ALD-DNA group but rebounded with azithromycin treatment (C). D Azithromycin downregulated the increased expression of IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, iNOS, CD86, TLR2 and TLR4 observed in the ALD-DNA group and upregulated the decreased expression of TGF-\u03b2, Arg-1, Ym-1, Fizz-1 and CD206 observed in the ALD-DNA group. N = 4. Negative control: the unstained cells. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01. 6 Azithromycin promoted M2 polarisation in MRL-Fas lpr mice in vivo. A After azithromycin treatment, macrophage infiltration in the spleen was markedly decreased, and the M1 proportion showed no significant change, but the M2 proportion was notably increased. B The expression of M1-related genes including IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, iNOS, CD86, TLR2 and TLR4 was decreased, while that of M2-related genes including TGF-\u03b2, Arg-1, Ym-1, Fizz-1 and CD206 was increased post azithromycin treatment. N = 4. Negative control: the unstained cells. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01. autoantibodies in SLE, ALD-DNA resulted in autoantibody changes that fit well with those in SLE. Notably, while AZM treatment was administered at the same time as ALD-DNA immunisation, the level of serum anti-dsDNA antibodies was significantly decreased, which indicated that AZM successfully inhibited the production of autoantibodies in lupus. However, the level of serum anti-dsDNA antibodies was still higher than that in normal controls. In our opinion, this might be due to the dosing strategy. Thus, further studies are needed to improve the efficacy in terms of dosage, delivery route and length of administration. Additionally, spleens from mice in the ALD-DNA group were enlarged compared with those from normal controls, in line with excessive autoimmunity. As expected, spleen size decreased after AZM treatment. Unexpectedly, there was an extreme loss of hair around the injection site, and we speculated that this might be due to attack on the hair follicles by overactivated T cells induced by ALD-DNA 35 . Interestingly, the hairs regrew after AZM treatment; we speculated that this was due to the AZM-induced M2 polarisation, as Szu-Ying Chu previously reported M2 macrophages are beneficial to hair regeneration 36 .",

Thus, evaluations of kidney pathology and renal function are crucial for the assessment of SLE. In this study, serum creatinine was used to assess renal function. We found that 4 weeks after ALD-DNA immunisation, serum creatinine levels were increased markedly in the ALD-DNA group and peaked at the 8th week. However, the rise was reduced significantly with AZM treatment. Pathologically, ALD-DNA induced relatively high inflammatory infiltration, renal tubular swelling, interstitial congestion, glomerulofibrosis, IgG deposition and glomerular basement membrane thickening, which were relieved by AZM. The above data sufficiently demonstrated \"ALD-DNA-induced lupus\" in terms of autoimmune antibodies, renal function and kidney pathology. Moreover, AZM showed an exciting therapeutic effect on ALD-DNA-induced lupus in vivo for the first time. Since occasional AZM-induced impaired hepatic function was reported previously 38 , we tested the levels of AST and ALT at the end point. Fortunately, no significant changes were detected.",

In our previous study, we indicated that AZM could promote M2 polarisation in lupus conditions in vitro. In the current study, we further investigated whether AZM can induce M2 polarisation in lupus mice in vivo for the first time. As the spleen is the largest immune organ containing a massive population of macrophages 40 , we assessed macrophage polarisation in the spleen. The results showed extremely more macrophage infiltration and M1 dominance in spleens from the ALD-DNA group than in those from the control group, which was largely in line with previous studies 12, 41 . Notably, the administration of AZM significantly alleviated macrophage infiltration, and the proportion of M2 macrophages rebounded. To indicate the macrophage phenotypes were functional, we also analysed M1/M2-related genes in the kidneys because the kidney is the main target organ and very vulnerable in lupus 42, 43 . ALD-DNA immunisation led to significant upregulation of M1related genes and inhibition of M2-related genes. In contrast, M1-related genes were downregulated after AZM treatment, while M2-related genes were upregulated to varying degrees. All these data demonstrated that ALD-DNA played a distinctive role characterised by increased macrophage infiltration and M1 dominance, which are consistent with the M1 dominance in lupus reported by Orme and Mohan 44 . For the first time, we confirmed that AZM could promote M2 polarisation in lupus in vivo.",

As a lupusprone murine model, MRL-Fas lpr mice showed higher levels of anti-dsDNA antibodies and serum creatinine than ALD-DNA-induced lupus mice, corresponding to early onset, rapid development and severe renal damage [45] [46] [47] . After AZM treatment, there was a slowdown in the upward trend of the anti-dsDNA antibody level, but the level continued to increase with time. The slowdown in this upward trend showed that AZM could alleviate the development of lupus in MRL-Fas lpr mice but could not totally restrain it. As we discussed above, the dosage, delivery route and length of administration of the treatment should be investigated further to improve the efficacy. The changes in pathology and serum creatinine levels also indicated that AZM effectively reversed kidney damage. Next, we explored whether AZM could induce M2 polarisation in vivo in MRL-Fas lpr mice. As expected, the number of infiltrated macrophages in the spleen was decreased after AZM treatment, with a remarkably higher proportion of M2 macrophages. The assessment of M1/M2-related genes also showed significant downregulation of M1-related genes and upregulation of M2-related genes after AZM treatment. All these data suggested again that M1 macrophages function in a \"destroyer\" role in the development of SLE, while M2 macrophages play a \"healer\" role. Overall, we are convinced that AZM can promote M2 polarisation in lupus in vivo, which ultimately alleviates the symptoms of SLE.",
