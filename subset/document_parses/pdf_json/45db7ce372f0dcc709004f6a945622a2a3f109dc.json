Our article also argues that zoonotic pathogens are one of the entities mobilized by local knowledge to attenuate troubles in ordinary relations with animals, and shows that the conservation of cultural heritage is a tool of mitigation for infectious diseases emerging in animal reservoirs.",

The current COVID-19 pandemic, probably caused by a coronavirus endemic in bats, shows the high cost of public health measures for emerging pathogens and the need for their early detection in animal reservoirs [61, 62] . A \"One Health approach\" connects the surveillance of diseases in humans, animals, and their environment to understand how infectious diseases emerge and are transmitted from one species to the other, as well as within each species. However, the One Health approach has suffered from a colonial view of animals and their environments as resources to valorize, and failed to take into account non-Western views of animal agency [29] . Parasitologists, epidemiologists and ecologists have turned toward social anthropologists to understand the social and cultural factors allowing pathogens to cross the barriers between species and involve local populations in the management of animal diseases before they spread to humans [15] .",

Hotspots of zoonotic emergence have become sites of investigation on the multiple relations between humans and animals [5] . Concepts of proximity and contact, often used in One Health representations of zoonotic transmission, have been problematized using materials from narratives on broader multi-species ecologies and histories [1, 41] . The urgency of biosecurity interventions, focusing on early detection using sentinel devices, is often contrasted with cultural practices which need to be regulated, such as bushmeat hunting or wildlife markets [23, 30] . However, social anthropology cannot oppose a global view of nature as self-regulating with its cultural localizations producing risks of emergence. The opposition between traditional societies fearing dangers and modern societies calculating risks appears less relevant in a world where common uncertainties require a plurality of cognitive operations [11, 21, 32] .",

            "text": "As the term \"culture\" is not adequate to study the perception of zoonotic risks, it is more fruitful to focus on representations of species barriers. In all societies, humans make inferences about the behaviors of animals based on their similarities and differences. A zoonotic disease is an opportunity to question what humans and animals have in common based on shared representations, which stabilize the potential crisis opened by the disease. The term \"ontology\" has been used in the debate within anthropology and science studies to overcome the opposition between nature and culture, since it takes seriously the statements about what \"is\" and what \"is not\" in a collective form of life, particularly in the perception of invisible entities such as spirits, ghosts or microbes [19, 60] . However, the term \"representation\" is more open to investigation on how these statements are stabilized over time, inscribed in modes of production and valorized by institutions. Species barriers are problematic sites not only for disease management but also for ethical reflexivity and social justice: they raise the question \"What made me sick?\" in a web of vulnerable entanglements between humans and non-humans. While the concept of cultural behavior focuses on human-animal proximity as an obstacle to the global management of zoonoses, the concept of social representation helps to include societies living with animals in global health [13] . When domestic and/or wild animals are killed to prevent the spread of their diseases to other animals or to humans, this causes ontological and ethical problems because humans consider animals not only as commodities that can be destroyed in a food chain but also, in some cases, as companions within kinship relations of attention and care [16, 17] . A sick animaldomestic, wild, or petis an ambivalent being for humans who have to protect it against the disease but also protect themselves from the disease; hence the need to compare different ways to mitigate this existential tension through collective representations.",

From a quantitative point of view, the question \"Can diseases be transmitted from animals to humans?\" received a positive answer among 60% of the people we interviewed in Australia, 0% in Laos, and 85% in Mongolia. When we asked our informants about their understanding of bacteria or viruses, we often had very vague answers, or simple repetitions of public health campaigns. However, we used ontological questions as ways to describe ethnographically the parameters of social representations of species barriers, and adapted them to local conditions. Rather than ask if our informants knew about a zoonosis, we asked them how they represented microbes and how microbes crossed species barriers causing pathologies among animals and humans. While the knowledge of microbes as \"natural\" entities was very unstable, our interviews aimed at tracing the map of entities that were mobilized to cope with a potential disease spreading through animals. The three researchers thus combined the qualitative questionnaire method, open-ended discussion, and participant observation by taking part in rituals involving animals, animal labor or herding practices.",

During the past 20 years, the growing number of captive elephants tested positive for TB in various institutions worldwide (in western zoos or in some tourist camps in Asian elephant range countries) has caused public health concerns, mainly related to the significant risk of propagation. Globally, TB remains the second leading cause of human death after HIV, generating nearly 1.5 million deaths annually. In this context, the concern with elephant TB has led to unprecedented numbers of seroprevalence and epidemiological studies to help prevent and treat the animals [35] . Southeast Asia hosts more than 15 000 elephants in captivity and has the highest prevalence of tuberculosis in the world. A survey made in Laos [31] indicated a prevalence of 34% among elephants tested, the highest rate for TB in elephants in Asia so far. Since TB is a slow endemic disease, and is not necessarily the primary cause of death for infected patients, there has been no public health crisis after this warning. However, because TB in elephants is considered a reverse zoonosis transmitted from humans to animals, surveillance aims at protecting humans and animals [26] .",

In these areas, families practice extensive, polyspecific, and nomadic herding, according to predefined routes across seasonal rotating pastures to preserve soil and water resources. Sandrine Ruhlmann has focused on the management and surveillance of three animal diseases that were controlled under the Communist government, but that have since chronically re-emerged, developed, and spread in different ways over the vast Mongolian territory: brucellosis (a bacterial disease -Brucella melitensis -, endemic and widespread, zoonotic), anthrax (a bacterial disease -Bacillus anthracis -, localized, zoonotic), and foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) (a viral disease -Picornaviridae aphthovirus -, localized and pandemic, non-zoonotic) [48, 49] . The prevalence of brucellosis is high throughout the entire territory, among human and domestic animal populations (mainly ruminants), with disparities between the 21 provinces, depending on whether NGOs have implemented a vaccination program for several years. An important part of the rural population (sometimes up to 11%) is infected, especially animal workers [2] . However, interviewed herders do not fear the \"bacterium\" (bakteri) as they know that \"brucellosis\" (brucell\u00ebz) is transmitted through contact with milked milk, consumption of dairy products and undercooked animal flesh, saliva, and blood at the time of delivery, but are not aware of the correlation between brucellosis and abortion in animal and human populations. By contrast, they are afraid of \"anthrax\" (boom), because they know that the \"bacterium\" (bakteri) is highly contagious, transmitted by hair, wool, hides, bone, air, meat, and contact, and is fatal for animals and humans, and can be widespread over the whole territory, excluding southern desert provinces. Finally, \"foot-andmouth disease\" (\u0161\u00fclhij or \u0161\u00fclhij \u00f6v\u010din) is the most familiar disease because it is \"highly visible\" in the media and \"highly contagious among animals\" (air, contact with bodily excretions such as feces, urine, milk and saliva from affected animals), and has chronically emerged among domestic and wild bovine, ovine, and caprine animals, which are in contact during seasonal migrations, in the four eastern provinces. Herders do not fear this \"virus\" (virus) in the sense that it kills only animals, domestic and wild, but they fear that their herd may be infected and that, according to international and national regulations, they must slaughter all or part of their herd, their only resource and source of income [12, 46] .",

Most people are aware of the potential presence of the virus and special attention is taken during the cooking process to \"kill the germs\". While this practice of long and slow cooking is considered traditional, it coincides with non-indigenous public health messages about pathogen transmission, imported into local discourse. Early ethnographer Walter Roth [47] mentioned the alimentary use of bats amongst the North Queensland indigenous people at the end of the 19th century, but no medicinal practices have ever been documented. Soup made from flying fox is also considered traditional medicine to treat certain types of respiratory problems, less severe but analogous to the respiratory syndromes caused by the Hendra virus.

Early ethnographers Baldwin Spencer and Francis Gillen [52] recorded an Arrernte (central desert language group) totemic story linking an animal species, a place and an infection related to a narrative and sickness called erkincha, a disfiguring disease (Treponema bacteria) associated with syphilis. Part of the erkincha mythical story is concerned with Alchipa, a totemic being, related to a small desert marsupial (western quoll, Dasyurus geoffroii), that carried the disease erkincha and disappeared after creating several landmarks. Since then, the Alchipa has been associated with a rock called \"Aperta atnumbria,\" a specific site that causes diseased growth (early stage of syphilis). Spencer and Gillen also observed a restriction towards eating the marsupial species (Dasyurus geoffroii) called after their Alchipa ancestor, to prevent the disease. The existence of food restrictions applied to animal species carrying a disease clearly confirms the existence of specific local knowledge about disease transmission between animals and humans [58] .",

But for them, the presence of external signs on elephant bodies (such as runny nose) does not appear relevant. According to some mahouts, after 4 or 5 days working in the forest, the elephant's back becomes emaciated, and some even change their skin colour in the forest.

Households have \"something to repair\", \"happiness to (re)call\", by themselves and/or by bringing a monk, a shaman, and a veterinarian, one after the other, without any hierarchy or distinction. The consultation of a ritual specialist leads Mongolian herders to list a set of spiritual entities on which their happiness and health depends: nature spirits-masters, Buddhist divinities, souls of the dead to be reborn, and souls of the dead condemned to wander.",

Flying foxes are highly regarded amongst Aboriginal people. There are several totemic sites associated with flying foxes in and around Yalanji country, and most of them are classified as restricted sacred areas. In the Australian totemic system, the elements inside the totemic geographical network are considered familiar and domestic entities. By contrast, what is outside this network, and does not have a totemic name, belongs to the virtual domain of the unknown. In this context, the flying fox, as a well-established totem, is closer to the domestic domain, while horses, as an introduced species, is closer to wilderness. The longstanding alimentary and medicinal use of the host species of Hendra virus tends to question the role of flying foxes as the origin of the zoonosis and to rethink cross-species transmission. From the perspective of long-term co-evolution in a network of kinship, the introduction of foreign domesticated animals (horses) to Australia has triggered a new human disease, born from the forced contact between domesticated and wild species.

However, they sometimes hunt to protect their herds from predators (wolves) or from infected wild animals (wolves, foxes, and marmots, infected with rabies or the plague), i.e. when symptoms are detected and animals become ill or die. Although they are not in close or daily contact with wild animals, domestic animals have occasional contact with them: for reasons of predation and migration, some wild species move more often and farther than domestic animals whose extensive herding is partly based on the principle of human nomadization. Also, very recently, the Mongolian government has ordered hunters and the military to shoot herds of gazelles, wild animals believed to be responsible for the emergence and spread of the FMD virus [48, 49] . Mongolian herders admit different degrees of domestication within their livestock, notably regarding horses, a half-domestic half-wild species. Horses are ambivalent means of transportation, used by monks to send away the soul of a deceased in funerary contexts. Wild animals with fur or feathers allow wandering souls of the dead to approach the living and roam around their homes [50] .",

Otherwise, the sick domestic animal undergoes another treatment: herders or veterinarians take away the infected animals (out of the camp, in the middle of the steppe, wild area), shoot them (cattle) or slice the throat (goat, sheep) thus letting blood flow onto the soil, push them into a deep holea mass grave -, disinfect carcasses with lime and cover them with soil. Before burying, they sometimes destroy them in a large fire. This means that contagious non-dismembered and bloodied carcasses are buried.",

In both cases (deceased humans considered as polluting and contagious animals), the government makes large pits in anticipation. After the disinfection of the pit and the body, the family purifies the house and personal belongings of the deceased in the same way as, in the context of FMD contamination, herders purify enclosures, tools and remaining animals. They use consecrated incense fumigations and libations of consecrated water and milk mixture, in addition to the disinfectant (lemonic acid) provided by the authorities. Finally, before going back home, herders must purify internal and external parts of their bodies: they ingest a sugar cube dipped in a consecrated mixture of water and milk, and they rub their hands and face with a cotton ball soaked in the same mixture [48, 50] .",

Informants mentioned that elephants know when they are going to die, and they let them go alone into nearby forest areas. Therefore, elephants are not killed by humans even if they are seriously ill or dying. However, an owner was said to deliberately shoot his elephant, not because it was ill or sick, but because it was too dangerous for humans. More generally, when an elephant dies, the owner calls the ritual specialist who, by a new ceremony, literally separates the animal from the household and organizes the funeral in the same way as for humans. During this ritual, he addresses the elephant's vital force (kwaan) and all the spirits to inform them that they are no longer part of the household, meaning that the animal no longer belongs to the elephant owner's family. The same treatment is applied to human funerals before bodies are buried. And only once this separation is made, the owner decides if the body of the elephant is burned, buried or even consumed. In Laos, eating elephant flesh is considered as taboo just like in South Asia [54] . Nevertheless, some Tai-Lao informants mentioned that they sometimes eat elephant flesh. The only elephant body parts they collect after death are the tusks (for male elephants), and hair from the tip of the tail.",

The same NGOs criticize the specialization of some herders in cashmere wool production, which gives them more money without providing more work. They also insist that this activity weighs too heavily on the ecosystem, does not optimize the regrowth of vegetation, generates overgrazing that causes climatic disasters (zud) (snowstorms that freeze the soil, tire the animals that die of hunger and cold) [3] , and causes the emergence of animal diseases such as in Siberia [53] .

An example of this tension can be found in the annual elephant festival, held since 2007 in the Province of Sayabouli in Laos. In the country, most of the elephant tourist camps are located in the Luang Prabang area, the ancient royal capital of the country nowadays turned into the most touristic place in Laos. In 2015, a caravan of 20 elephants (caravan xang) crossed the northern part of the country for 45 days, in order to raise both local and international awareness to help save the last elephants of Laos. The caravan was organized by the major conservation center of the country. The journey ended in Luang Prabang where it was associated with the 20th anniversary celebration of the city as a cultural heritage site of UNESCO. As part of the official activities of the celebration, an elephant parade including more than 30 pachyderms was organized in the city. While the warning on elephant TB aimed at protecting mahouts from their elephants, the risks of a TB outbreak in elephants was perceived by conservationists and tourist camps as a risk of business collapse; hence, little information was communicated to the general public about the subject. Moreover, the politics of conservation left little space for mahouts and elephant owners, who were folklorized during the elephant caravan, the latter wearing ancient costumes dated from ancient royal times to appear in public. There is an opportunity for such knowledge to be integrated into issues related to public health and protection of the environment. By translating risks of TB into more general concerns for threatened species, programs for the surveillance of the disease would probably make more sense for the mahouts and owners.",

Over the last 50 years, the practice was abandoned in some parts of central Australia as indigenous people were removed from the territory. During a bat survey in Central Australia in the mid 1990s, a team of scientists was investigating the presence of a local ghost bat (Macroderma gigas), living in desert caves and deep overhangs under the guidance of the indigenous owner of the land. Because the practice of burning had been abandoned, bats did not find enough food sources and became extinct. Their disappearance left the local indigenous communities in a state of profound grief, knowing that they could not perform the appropriate tasks necessary to maintain their land [7] .",

In this sculpture, the bats took the minimalist form of a dozen 20-cm elongated wooden blocks painted with black and red stripes, hanging between two poles [59] . Because the Kalben story is partly secret, the production was closely controlled and limited to museums and fine art markets. Only a fraction of the Kalben myth was made available to the public, including a part on the regenerative capacity of totemic bats which, according to Pambegan, rose from the dead after they were killed.

Because they are reverse processes (transmissions of pathogens from animals to humans and from humans to animals), zoonoses produce complex relations between humans and animals that cannot be categorized by the opposition between natural reservoirs and cultural interventions, but should be analyzed in an ontological process of social representation.
