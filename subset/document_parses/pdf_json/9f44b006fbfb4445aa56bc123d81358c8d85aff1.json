The majority of infections occurs in children, but severe courses are mainly observed in very young-as well as elderly-or immunocompromised individuals [4] . According to the Austrian Federal Health Ministry, influenza vaccination is recommended for all adults and particularly for persons aged >60 years, patients with chronic illnesses or other risk factors as well as health care workers [5] . Additionally, influenza vaccination was recently included into the cost-free children vaccination program and is generally recommended in children aged >6 months. Despite these extensive national influenza vaccination recommendations, a comparably low vaccination rate of about 6% (2015/16) in the general Austrian population compared to about 73% in the UK was recently reported [6] . Suggested reasons include the lack of financial reimbursement and social marketing, lack of continuity and separated specialty care within the health care system, negative attitudes of health care workers along with generally low vaccination rates in adults [7] . While higher influenza vaccination rates have been reported among some specific populations, including patients with rheumatic or malignant diseases in Austria, fear of side effects or worsening of the primary disease remains one of the most intriguing obstacles to increase the willingness for vaccination [8, 9] .",

Therefore, scientific guidelines recommend annual influenza vaccination for patients with chronic kidney- [16] or chronic liver disease [17, 18] as well as for solid organ-and hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients [19, 20] . Similarly, the Austrian Federal Health Ministry recommends vaccination against s. pneumoniae for all children as well as all adults aged >60 years. Vaccination is further strongly recommended in patients with a high risk for a severe course of disease such as patients with chronic kidney disease, liver cirrhosis as well as patients receiving solid organ transplantation [5] . Vaccination against h. influenzae B (HiB) is generally recommended for children as well as for patients with immune deficiencies such as patients with deficiencies in T-and B-cell function [5] . Additionally, HiB vaccination is recommended in selected patients receiving solid organ transplantation [21] . Data on vaccination rates, the awareness of the critical importance of vaccination in general as well as on specific aspects in these special populations are required to improve patient care but have not been reported in Austria yet. The aim of our study was to evaluate (i) the influenza vaccination uptake in the upcoming winter season 2020/2021 and (ii) to analyze factors influencing decision-making for having an influenza vaccine by assessing sociodemographic-and transplant associated parameters as well as subjective individual reasons among patients with CKLD.",

The printed questionnaire was completed anonymously. Patients entering the nephrology/hepatology outpatient clinic or dialysis units were screened for study inclusion/exclusion criteria by attending physicians, nurses or non-medical hospital staff. If patients fulfilled inclusion criteria and did not fulfil exclusion criteria, questionnaires not asking for any personal data potentially allowing patient identification (i.e. name or date of birth) were distributed. Patients were asked to answer the written questionnaire alone. Afterwards, patients were instructed to return the anonymously completed questionnaire before leaving the hospital. The questionnaire consisted of nineteen questions evaluating demographic (age, gender, country of origin, education level and marital status) and transplant-associated (donor type, age at transplantation, number of previous transplantations) parameters as well as the current and previous influenza vaccination status (including vaccination status in the season 2019/2020 and 2016-2018). The main endpoint was willingness to be vaccinated against influence in the winter season 2020/2021 by asking: \"Are you planning to get vaccinated against influenza for the next winter season 2020/2021?\" (as demonstrated in the questionnaire added as S1 Table) . Patients were asked about factors considered for their decision to have the influenza vaccination performed, which included the following: medical recommendation against/for influenza vaccination, source of recommendation for vaccination (general practitioner, specialist for nephrology or hepatology, nurse, transplant outpatient clinic, dialysis unit), individual motives (previous influenza infection, self-assessed knowledge, previously experienced side effects, contraindications, interactions, possible harms to transplanted organ), logistical reasons (availability of vaccination, affordability, time requirement for vaccination), source of possible recommendation against vaccination and the patients self-assessed risk of influenza infection and severe disease courses. Furthermore, patients were asked if they received vaccination against pathogens associated with a higher risk of a severe disease course in post-transplant-or immunosuppressed populations such as streptococcus pneumoniae or haemophilus influenzae.",

We hypothesize that the COVID-19 pandemic might be the primary reason for the increasing willingness to receive influenza vaccination. Almost 30% of patients believed that influenza vaccination was becoming more important since the outbreak of the pandemic and this factor remained a significant predictor for vaccination willingness in multivariable regression analysis. We also found that patient\u00b4s individual risk perception and their previous vaccination behavior were strong indicators for the plan to receive vaccination. Nevertheless, these numbers still indicate an urgent need for improvement. In Germany-representing a country with a comparable health care system to Austria-influenza vaccination rates of 31%-33% in kidney transplant recipients and of 42-44% in patients undergoing haemodialysis have been reported for the time period of 2012 to 2017 [13] . Although vaccination rates in renal transplant recipients were comparable in our study, included hemodialysis patients reported profoundly lower rates in the previous years. This may seem counterintuitive, as hemodialysis patients receive closer medical surveillance due to weekly visits by nephrologists. However, our study revealed that general practitioners and specialists at outpatient clinics were the most important sources of vaccine recommendations. Additionally, the costs for pre-emptive treatments such as vaccinations are not reimbursed by Austrian social insurances in the hospital setting explaining the fact that influenza vaccination in Austria is mostly performed by general practitioners. As hemodialysis patients are mostly managed by medical specialists, primary health care utilization might be underrepresented. In line with this assumption, a recent study confirmed that dialysis patients that are also treated by a primary care physician, were significantly more likely to receive influenza vaccination [24] . Most frequent arguments against influenza vaccination included the fear of side effects and allograft injury. The fear of side effects was also a prominent argument in previous questionnaire studies, even in medical staff [8, [25] [26] [27] . The safety of seasonal trivalent inactivated influenza vaccines as well as the high dose and booster dose has been confirmed in several studies including transplant recipients [28, 29] . A large meta-analysis from 2018 also showed no increased risk for the development of donor-specific-antibodies or rejection in influenza vaccinated patients [30] . In contrast, these studies even suggested that the risk of acute cellular rejection and chronic allograft dysfunction is significantly higher for both renal-and liver transplant recipients following influenza infection [31] . Additionally, influenza infection was recently identified as an important trigger for the development of acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF), which occurred in almost every fifth patient with liver cirrhosis who had to be hospitalized due to influenza infection. In this study, influenza infection led to the development of organ failures, secondary infections and death underlining the importance of influenza vaccination in this population [14] . In line, a recent meta-analysis including 12 studies evaluating the effectiveness of influenza vaccination in patients with chronic liver disease also concluded that potential benefits outweigh the costs and risks associated with vaccination [32] . Therefore, providing proper patient information on potential negative consequences of influenza infection may help to increase compliance to vaccination programs in these special populations.",

Influenza vaccination proponents were significantly older as compared to those unwilling to receive vaccination, which is in line with findings reported by Harrison et al. [8] . Vaccination recommendation awareness in younger patients may be lower in primary health facilities as national influenza vaccination recommendations primarily target elderly individuals. Interestingly, patients with migratory background and patients of younger age reported that vaccine-associated costs were a significant reason for refusing influenza vaccination. Before Covid-19, influenza vaccination was not routinely covered by public health insurance in Austria, but currently free of charge vaccination programs were initiated in order to support the public health system. A previous study showed that reimbursement of vaccination expenses can improve vaccination acceptance significantly [33] and further analysis of vaccination rates after this season will be needed to evaluate, if this will also be true during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.",

Patients were asked to complete questionnaires without assistance and due to limited personnel capacity, we were unable to evaluate the return rate of distributed questionnaires. The survey was conducted in German, thus patients may have been precluded due to language barriers. Nevertheless, patients with a significant language barrier, are generally asked to bring a family member or a friend capable of understanding and speaking German or English which might have compensated this possible bias to a certain degree. Furthermore, the main parameter of interest was the influenza vaccinate rate in the upcoming winter season and false statements due to socially expected behavior cannot be excluded. Nevertheless, we tried to minimize this potential effect by completely anonymizing the survey. Additionally, self-assessed vaccination data might not always be the most appropriate vaccination uptake measure, however, due to the anonymous study design, we could not link data derived from the questionnaires to electronic patient records.",

The fear of complications or graft injury, inefficient vaccinations and missing recommendations were identified as most frequent arguments against vaccination. On the other hand, most patients considered themself as being at greater risk of influenza infection-indicating that vaccination readiness can be significantly improved if disruptive factors are appropriately addressed. Improving co-operations with primary health care providers, active vaccination surveillance programs and specialist consultations including more comprehensive information on potential adverse events or complications and political measures such as financial reimbursement might help to further promote vaccination rates in this endangered patient population.",

Patients who received influenza vaccination in the previous seasons were significantly more likely to declare their willingness to take influenza vaccination in the upcoming winter season 2020/2021 [odds ratio (OR) for patients who received influenza vaccination during the season 2019/2020: 17.1 (95%CI: 9.5-30.7), p<0.001; season 2016-2018: OR 8.9 (95%CI: 5.5-14.5), p<0.001]. However, only eighty-one patients (16.7%) reported vaccination / willingness for vaccination at all three time points. Three (0.6%) patients indicated that they did not yet decide regarding influenza vaccination.
