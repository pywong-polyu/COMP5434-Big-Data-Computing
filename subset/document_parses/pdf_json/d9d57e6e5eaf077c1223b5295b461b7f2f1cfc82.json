Compared to controls, H1N1/09 patients showed increased expression of inflammatory pathway genes and reduced expression of adaptive immune pathway genes. This was validated on an independent cohort. The most significant function distinguishing H1N1/09 patients from controls was protein synthesis, with reduced gene expression. Reduced expression of protein synthesis genes also characterized the H1N1/09 expression profile compared to children with RSV and bacterial infection, suggesting that this is a key component of the pathophysiological response in children hospitalized with H1N1/09 infection.",

Therefore, differences in lymphocyte proportion do not explain the observed differences, although a role for lymphocyte subset populations is not excluded. H1N1/09 patients showed reduced expression in adaptive immune response pathways, including T-cell activation through NFAT, B cell activation, and MHC class II antigen presentation. Reduced expression of adaptive T-and B-cell pathways may represent a host negative regulatory feedback mechanism [3] , or viral-induced immune subversion [10] , analogous to viral inhibition of antigen presentation by inhibition of the MHC class II transactivator.",

Reduced expression of protein synthesis genes was significant between H1N1/09 and controls (P = 7.9 \u00d7 10 \u221226 ) and also between H1N1/09 and RSV or bacterial infection (P = 2.73 \u00d7 10 \u221213 and 1.6 \u00d7 10 \u221211 , respectively; Figure 2 ).

Influenza virus has been observed to shut-off protein synthesis and decrease mRNA levels in infected cells [13] , but the phenomenon we have observed in peripheral blood suggests a widespread alteration affecting cells distant from the site of infection. We hypothesize that suppression of protein synthesis may be a distinctive feature of H1N1/09 infection and may play a role in the prolonged debility, fatigue, and delayed recovery seen in severely affected patients. Many of the fatal H1N1/09 cases had acute respiratory distress syndrome requiring prolonged ventilation [1] , and late pulmonary hemorrhage or persistent respiratory failure, with death weeks after the acute illness. Suppressed protein synthesis might result in poor tissue recovery and may provide an explanation for the prolonged illness and poor outcome in some patients.",

Heatmaps show separation of H1N1/09 and comparator groups by unsupervised Manhattan clustering, based on top SDE transcripts. Each row represents one transcript; each column represents one patient, with a red bar below indicating H1N1/09 and a blue bar a control (A), RSV (B), or bacterial infection (C ). Curtailed transcript lists of highly significant probes were used for clarity (P value thresholds of 10 \u22125 (n = 90 transcripts), .002 (n = 97), and .001 (n = 156), respectively, for control, RSV, and bacterial comparisons). Expression intensity is indicated by color (increased abundance in red, decreased in blue, intermediate in yellow).",
