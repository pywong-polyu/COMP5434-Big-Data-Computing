Intentionally creating even brief moments of lower stress through mindfulness meditation can reduce both physiologic stress markers and depressive and anxiety symptoms (7, 8) . To make the time required to recover, we need to lean on our social supports, including our colleagues, coworkers, teammates, friends, and families. They will understand because they have the same fears, challenges, and needs. Second, social distancing cannot mean social isolation. Support groups of peers (6) or informal opportunities to share our experiences are invaluable. Third, monitoring and early detection of potential problems is crucial. Look for warning signs in yourself and others. Monitor for maladaptive behaviors, such as sleep disturbances, increases in drinking or smoking, use of illicit drugs, or feelings of hopelessness or helplessness (5) . Fourth, if you are struggling, ask for help early. Psychiatrists and psychologists have a range of effective treatments, including brief, focused psychotherapy; group therapy; and, if needed, prescription medication. Many medical centers have employee assistance programs primed to provide assessments and support. If you are in a smaller program or team, look to the burgeoning community efforts, where psychiatrists, psychologists, and other providers are offering assistance. Finally, do not ignore these signs in your colleagues. They may be struggling and need your concern and support.",

Although this stigma discourages seeking care, the consequences for untreated mental health disorders are substantial.
