In darkness, the loss of viability of the virus on stainless steel is temperature dependent, but this is hidden by the effect of the sunlight from the first minutes of exposure. The virus shows a sensitivity to sunlight proportional to the illuminance intensity of the sunlight. The presence of interfering substances has a moderate effect on virus viability even with an elevated illuminance. Thus, SARS-CoV-2 is rapidly inactivated by simulated sunlight in the presence or absence of high levels of interfering substances at 20\u00b0C or 35\u00b0C and 50% relative humidity.",

This study is the first to reveal that the presence of high levels of interfering substances had little impact on the persistence of SARS-CoV-2 on stainless steel following exposure to simulated sunlight. Thus, SARS-CoV-2 should be rapidly inactivated in outdoor environments in the presence or absence of interfering substances. Our results indicate that transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is unlikely to occur through outdoor surfaces, dependent on illuminance intensity. Moreover, most studies are interested in lineage S of SARS-CoV-2. In our experiments, we studied the stability of L-type strains, which comprise the majority of strains isolated from worldwide patients. Nevertheless, the effect of sunlight seems to be similar regardless of the strain studied, suggesting that the greater spread of certain variants is not correlated with better survival in outdoor conditions.",

            "text": "The evaluation of SARS-CoV-2 stability under both indoor and outdoor conditions is necessary to understand the virus transmission in order to limit the spread of the virus. Three major factors might affect virus viability: temperature, humidity and solar radiation. Radiation emitted by sunlight is the primary cause of virus inactivation in the atmosphere (14) . It has been known for a long time that radiation is absorbed by the nucleic acids of the virus and induces chemical modifications (15) . Among these types of radiation, UVC (wavelength from 100 nm to 280 nm) light effectively inactivates coronaviruses (16) . UV radiations with a wavelength of at least 290 nm (UVB and UVA) reach the surface of the Earth, but a very low level of UVC reaches the surface of the Earth due to absorption by the atmosphere (17) . Thus, our study focused on UVA and UVB. Using a model estimating solar inactivation of the virus, it was previously calculated that 90% of SARS-CoV-2 is inactivated after 11 to 34 min of midday sunlight exposure in North America in summer (18) . This exposure is similar during summer in France. A recent study shows that 90% of the SARS-CoV-2 suspended in simulated saliva or culture medium and dried on stainless steel is inactivated every 6.8 min and every 14.3 min, respectively, when the virus is exposed to simulated sunlight representative of the summer solstice. This study was the first investigation analyzing the effect of simulated sunlight on inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 dried on inanimate surfaces. Nevertheless, the antiviral activity of simulated sunlight was only evaluated at a single temperature (20\u00b0C 6 4\u00b0C), a relative humidity (RH) of 19% 6 5% (a very dry climate; in most climates, outside relative humidity is higher than 20%), and with a low level of interfering substances (19) .",

Then, we investigated the impact of various illuminance intensities on virus viability at 35\u00b0C and 50% humidity. The following three illuminance conditions were studied: darkness, 10 klx, and 56 klx (equivalent to an irradiance of 442 W/m 2 ). The inactivation kinetics and regression linear fit of SARS-CoV-2 recovered from stainless steel coupon after different experiment conditions as a function of the illuminance intensity are shown in Fig. 3A . At 35\u00b0C, infectious virus was still detectable up to 20 min at 10 klx. For an illuminance of 56 klx, infectious virus was no longer detectable after 5 min of exposure. Ninety percent of viral load was lost every 9 min and 12 s at an illuminance of 10 klx. At 56 klx, this time was reduced to 2 min and 12 s. These results indicated that the decay rate increased from 25.5% to 106% per minute for illuminance from 10 klx to 56 klx ( Fig. 3B and C) . Under lighting conditions, the rates of inactivation of the virus were significantly faster than those obtained in darkness (p-direction = 0).

In small stainless-steel coupons, 10 ml of a suspension of SARS-CoV-2 at 3.43 \u00c2 10 6 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID 50 )/ml was deposited and dried at room temperature for 45 min. Then, the coupons with dried viral supernatant were exposed in a chamber at 35\u00b0C or 20\u00b0C in darkness. The relative humidity was regulated and maintained at 50% (6 5%). For each point of the kinetics analysis, three coupons were taken. Each experiment was independent and was repeated three times. (A) Bayesian inference was conducted on these nine (3 \u00c2 3) data sets. For each condition, we plotted 30 random lines from the Bayesian inference. Each point represents the log 10 of tissue culture infectious dose estimated by the Reed-Muench method.

            "text": "Our study confirmed that in darkness, the decay rate of SARS-CoV-2 on stainless steel is dependent on temperature (22, 23) . However, we observed different half-life values of SARS-CoV-2 on stainless steel (119 min at 20\u00b0C and 53 min at 35\u00b0C at 50% RH) in comparison to the mean of half-life values reported in previous articles (9, 10, (22) (23) (24) . The varied persistence of SARS-CoV-2 estimated in these different articles (from 2.5 h to 11.54 h) could be explained by different experimental conditions, including temperature (from 19\u00b0C to 40\u00b0C), relative humidity (20% to 70%), the initial load, or the drying exposure time. Indeed, it has been shown that these different factors could have an impact on the stability of SARS-CoV-2. Compared with the halflives of other respiratory viruses, such as influenza A (H1N1), SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV, the half-life of SARS-CoV-2 is similar to those of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (10, 25), but the virus appears to be more stable than H1N1 (30 min at 22\u00b0C and 50 to 60% RH) (26) . Currently, very few data are available on the impact of sunlight on the survival of respiratory viruses on inanimate surfaces. Sunlight is composed of UVA, UVB, and UVC radiation. Many investigations have shown the efficacy of UVC against SARS-CoV-2 (16). Nevertheless, outdoors, a very low level of UVC reaches the Earth's surface. Our investigation revealed that simulated sunlight with UVA and UVB radiations rapidly inactivates SARS-CoV-2. This inactivation was independent of temperature under our experimental conditions. We investigated two temperatures for comparisons of illuminance, 20\u00b0C and 35\u00b0C, which induced a lower decay rate. Following exposure at 10 klx, 90% of SARS-CoV-2 virus was inactivated within 10 min regardless of the temperature tested. We suggest that the impact of illuminance on SARS-CoV-2 inactivation is so rapid that it hides the effect of the temperature, which is observable at longer kinetic times in the dark. It was previously shown that in indoor conditions, the persistence of SARS-CoV-2 is longer at 4\u00b0C than at 21\u00b0C (9) . It would be interesting to investigate the impact of illuminance at lower temperatures, such as 4\u00b0C to mimic winter conditions. However, simulated sunlight induces a heating of the chamber. Maintaining a temperature at 4\u00b0C is a challenge and requires tool optimization. At 35\u00b0C, we also observed that the decay rate is completely dependent on illuminance intensity. Ninety percent of infectious virus was degraded within 9 min at 10 klx and in 2 min and 17 s at 56 klx. Thus, our results corroborated the data obtained by Ratnesar-Shumate et al. under similar experimental conditions (19) . Our results show a decay rate several time faster than that predicted by the theory based on UVB radiation (18, 27) . The spectrum of the xenon lamp contained both UVA and UVB radiation. The virucidal action observed in our data is potentially linked to the combined effect of UVA and UVB, in which the UVA portion is less efficient than UVB (28, 29) .",

            "text": "As a respiratory virus, SARS-CoV-2 is mainly spread by airborne transmission, and possibly by fomites (39) . Environmental surfaces may be contaminated by droplets expelled by infected persons speaking, coughing, or sneezing or by indirect transfer from hands contaminated with excreted virus (39, 40) . Some studies have evaluated the stability of SARS-CoV-2 suspended in culture medium or simulated saliva. These data revealed that the simulated saliva had no or a moderately negative effect on the viability of SARS-CoV-2. These effects seem to be correlated with the temperature and the sunlight intensity exposure (19, 41) . Unlike mucus and saliva, interfering substances mimicking high protein levels induced a better persistence of coronavirus (42) . Pastorino et al. demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 stability was significantly preserved in the presence of BSA, with a half-life of more than 96 h versus 2.5 h without BSA (24) . In darkness, we did not observe an effect of interfering substances on the persistence of SARS-CoV-2 dried on stainless steel. Nevertheless, our kinetics analysis is short, and Pastorino et al. (24) showed an impact of BSA after more than 8 h of incubation. In the presence of simulated sunlight with an illuminance of 56 klx, we observed a moderate impact of the interfering substances on the survival of SARS-CoV-2 dried on stainless steel. Indeed, the decay rate was estimated as 94% per minute in the presence of interfering substances versus 106% per minute under clean conditions. The proteins contained in the interfering substances could act as a light protective barrier for the viral particles and increase virus viability. Nevertheless, the aromatic residues of proteins can capture UV radiations (from ;250 to 298 nm) and can induce structural changes such as denaturation and protein fragmentation, particularly in dehydrated systems (15) . Therefore, following sunlight exposure at 56 klx, interfering substances are probably rapidly degraded. That is why SARS-CoV-2 inactivation remains very rapid, with a half-life of less than 1 min.",
