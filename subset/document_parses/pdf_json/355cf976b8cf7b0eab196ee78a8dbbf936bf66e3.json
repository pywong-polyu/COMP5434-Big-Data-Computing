In other words, is there a socio-environmental disproportionate distribution of COVID-19-related outcomes? In this context, the aim of the present study is to investigate whether a geographic pattern of Covid-19 may be explained by spatial distribution of both long-term exposure to air pollution and a deprived living condition by assessing the spatial implication of neighbourhood characteristics on a spatial repartition of a Covid-19-related outcome.",

The Nitrogen dioxide (NO 2 ) is a good indicator for traffic-related air pollution and correlated with other traffic-related air pollution: particulate matter. In addition, the modelled NO 2 presents more spatial variations than other modelled outdoor pollutants [20] . Today, NO 2 may be considered a good proxy indicator of outdoor air pollution. Therefore, Nitrogen dioxide (NO 2 ) was the pollutant included in this study. This pollutant was known to be a good marker of the pollution due to road traffic. It was chosen because of the largest spatial variabilities observed compared to particle matters. The dataset of annual mean of NO 2 for each monitoring station was taken from 12 Associations for Surveillance of Air Quality (AASQA) through the National Association for the Surveillance of Air Pollution (ATMO France) [21] and from the European Environmental Agency, accessed on 22/05/2020, EEA, 2020).",

Focusing in further studies on larger risk factors is recommended, and might produce clearer results to explain the cluster of the excess risk. -Third, to characterize the chronic exposure to NO 2 , as recent studies investigated this issue, we used mean values over five years (2014-2018) from all monitoring stations located in each French department, including several background, traffic, and industrial stations. The mean values from each station may vary according to the type: Background, traffic, and industrial station, and to the area: rural, urban, and sub-urban. In our study, we used all data available at the French department level and carried out sensitivity analysis through three scenarios. However, in our study, using data from a different type of monitoring stations may misclassify the level of exposure of several French departments. At this time, these were the only available data for the study period, which covered all departments of France. However, the results revealed that the measure of associations as well as the statistical significance did not vary as much, according to the scenario used (data not shown).
