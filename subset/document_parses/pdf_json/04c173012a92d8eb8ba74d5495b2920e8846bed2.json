Contact tracing duration was assessed separately for the time between the date of index case confirmation and date of contact tracing initiation (interval I), and the date of contact tracing initiation and completion (interval II). We used log-rank tests and multivariable Poisson regression models to identify factors associated with timeliness. Results: The median duration of interval I and interval II was one (IQR: 1-2) and 3 days (IQR: 2-5), respectively. The contact tracing duration was shorter for passengers from flights where the index case was identified through mandatory testing directly upon arrival (median = 4; IQR: 3-5) compared to flights with index case detection through self-presentation at health facilities after arrival (median = 7; IQR: 5-8) (p-value = 0.018). Cumulative hazards for successful tracing were higher for Vietnamese nationals compared to non-Vietnamese nationals (p < 0.001). Conclusions: Contact tracing among flight passengers in the early stage of the COVID-19 epidemic in Vietnam was timely though delays occurred on high workload days. Mandatory SARS-CoV-2 testing at arrival may reduce contact tracing duration and should be considered as an integrated screening tool for flight passengers from high-risk areas when entering low-transmission settings with limited contact tracing capacity. We recommend a standardized riskbased contact tracing approach for flight passengers during the ongoing COVID-19 epidemic.",

The MoH assigned the NIHE as the key institution to manage and store data of contact tracing for flight passengers, including SARS-CoV-2 test results. Whenever a laboratory-confirmed polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test was positive, this was immediately reported by the testing facility to the NIHE. The NIHE then passed on the contact information of confirmed cases to the RRT. The RRT contacted and interviewed all COVID-19 cases for their travel history on international or domestic flights within 14 days from date of first symptom onset or date of first positive test result, whichever came first. The RRT then requested the Civil Aviation Administration and Immigration Bureau to provide flight manifests including passenger names, seat numbers, and personal contact details. The RRT shared this information with provincial CDCs and the local police. Local CDC staff and the local police jointly contacted passengers using email, telephone, or social media accounts if available. If necessary, other information such as residential or workplace addresses, information from tourism companies and embassies (for tourists), temporary/permanent residential registration data from local authorities, police department records, and immigration bureau data were also obtained. Furthermore, the MoH issued daily public announcements of flight details on mass media to advise all passengers on these flights to self-present immediately at designated facilities (Fig. 1) .",

However, this test and quarantine policy by area of departure individually for each passenger (i.e., passengers on the same flight could leave the airport without testing or quarantine if they did not depart from a designated high-risk area and would only be traced if a passenger on the same flight tested positive) was complex to implement.

Note: Dotted lines indicated the 95% confidence intervals obstacles often experienced by the contact tracers according to our anecdotal experience. Some of these passengers were successfully reached via email, their social media accounts, or tourism companies, while for others the involvement of their embassies or the Vietnamese immigration bureau was required, which added to the delay. Although the MoH issued information of flights with confirmed cases on mass media in both Vietnamese and English, this might not have reached all international tourists, which can explain further delays in this group. Incorrect or missing contact information added complexity and challenges to trace passengers. All inbound passengers from international flights had to complete a health declaration form either via a paperbased or web-based version, which was not always done correctly and completely. While the web-based data was directly linked to the passengers' management system, paper-based forms had to be entered manually by the Civil Aviation Administration and Immigration Bureau. Due to the large daily volume of paper-based records at that time, data entry errors might have occurred more frequently during high workload days. Our results suggest that contact tracing was more time-consuming with increasing passenger volume of that flights, which makes sense in light of the sudden overload of the system through large volume flights. Furthermore, all flights with medium and high volumes were international connections carrying large numbers of non-Vietnamese nationals. Collecting passenger details from foreign airlines also took longer because of differences in time zones and the need to convince the airline companies to hand over passenger lists, which often required to issue official request letters.",

While contact tracing was a crucial component for preventing the spread of COVID-19 in the community [17] , it is important to integrate contact tracing with other public health interventions such as border control and arrival testing. The high number of imported cases due to international travel has prevailed over time in many countries leading to overstretched contact tracing capacities [18, 19] .

However, we could not exclude such passengers from our analysis due to data unavailability but we estimate the number to be relatively low since the list of designed high-risk areas, which required direct quarantine upon arrival only of those passengers who started their journey from a high-risk area but not of all passengers on that plane, was only gradually expanded (see Additional file 1). Since we treated such contacts as successfully traced at the first day of contact tracing initiation, any effect of this would have contributed to an underestimation of the observed difference in timeliness between the two methods of index case detection. Thirdly, our analysis did not explore contextual factors that may have impacted the contact tracing duration and contact tracing evolution over time such as overall daily capacity of the contact tracing system, organizational structure, administrative delays, information distribution, number of jurisdictions, availability of human resources, and skill levels of contact tracers. Future mixed-methods research is needed to answer these questions.
