            "text": "The number of individuals involved in night-shift work has increased in the last twenty years in Western countries, and people working in the healthcare sector are among the most represented [1] [2] [3] . Night-shift work negatively impacts health, notably because of circadian rhythms perturbations [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] . Its multiple potential consequences include fatigue, sleep disturbance, an increased risk of cancer, cardiovascular diseases, metabolic syndrome, affective disorders, and impaired cognitive function [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] . Beyond these negative health consequences, night-shift work has also detrimental effects on quality of life [20] [21] [22] , which closely interacts with perceived health. Quality of working life (QWL), a multidimensional definition of well-being in the workplace, directly influences quality of life [23] . QWL is closely linked to factors such as workload, work-life balance, meaning of work and meaning at work [24, 25] , the latter two factors distinguishing how one individual perceives the meaning of what one does at work from the group to which one self-identifies in said work environment [26] . A recent literature review targeting healthcare work showed that QWL may also influence quality of care [27] . In the COVID-19 era, QWL remains poorly documented among hospital night-shift healthcare workers (NSHW), a population exposed to a higher risk of infection [28] , and who contributes to the continuity of care since the beginning of the pandemic. Managing healthcare systems during sanitary crises represents human and organizational challenges with potential mental health and quality of life implications [29] . A better understanding of QWL among NSHW is therefore needed, both from a public health perspective, and to identify levers which could help strengthening healthcare systems in such contexts.",

It included all 39 hospitals of the Assistance Publique-H\u00f4pitaux de Paris (AP-HP). One of the main objectives was to document NSHW's QWL (i.e. perceived quality of life at work) and its correlates shortly after the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic (March to May 2020), once healthcare workers were more available to participate in the survey. All individuals working in the AP-HP hospitals with a night-shift or a day/night alternation employment contract, regardless the years of experience, working fulltime or part-time, could participate in the survey. Exclusion criteria were as follows: (i) working only during the day; (ii) working less than three hours a day between 9 p.m. and 6 a.m. twice a week (including on-duty or on-call staff). In order to maintain a homogeneous study population, physicians were excluded from the analyses as they constitute a subgroup with specific characteristics. Sample size was expected to reach 10% of the 12,000 NSHW working in the AP-HP hospitals (target population). ",

NSHW's perceptions regarding their social and professional recognition were assessed using items related to under-estimation of night-shift work by colleagues, loved ones, and patients; perceptions of the importance of night missions and of workload during night; feeling valued by the general population as a NSHW during the pandemic. Most of these items were derived from different stigma scales [32] [33] [34] .

For each dimension, higher score values denote better QWL. A full-scale score, ranging from 0 to 115, can also be calculated as the sum of the six factor scores.

Indeed, this unexpected global health crisis caused by a previously unknown virus has deeply challenged healthcare workers' adaptability [37] , and has stressed the need to update safety guidelines to protect and prevent infection in hospital workers [38] . Another study in the COVID-19 context underlined that coping strategies could influence healthcare workers' wellbeing and QWL [39] . Findings from ALADDIN also highlight the importance of recognizing the contribution of all healthcare workers [37] . Previous work showed that emphasizing the value of healthcare workers' role was essential to motivate them and to increase their willingness to work during public health emergency situations [40] . Professional recognition also includes feeling supported by peers. In the ALADDIN survey, 64.7% of NSHW reported that night-shift work is often or always under-estimated by colleagues working during the day, and this perceived stigma had a significant detrimental effect on QWL. These findings highlight the need to develop interventions to improve communication, sharing of experiences, and support between day-shift and night-shift hospital healthcare workers. Such interventions can reinforce the sense of community among healthcare workers, and have the potential to improve NSHW's experience in the workplace. In addition, findings confirm that healthcare workers' perception of their public image can influence their QWL [41] .",

Previous research has also shown a negative psychological impact of these two factors among healthcare workers in France [42] . Interestingly, in ALADDIN, these factors were not identified as independent correlates of QWL in the final multivariable model, maybe because of their correlation with other COVID-related variables such as difficulties to get screened and perceived inadequate and insufficient protective measures. In the same way, changes in work organization since the beginning of the pandemic did not remain in the model after multivariable adjustment. There is a lack of published studies on QWL conducted among healthcare workers, especially in France. We identified only one recent survey, also based on the WRQoL scale [43] . QWL level observed in ALADDIN was lower than that found in this recent survey, conducted among 2,040 French anesthesiologists (median [IQR] WRQoL full-scale score: 71 [63-78] versus 77 [66-85]) [43] . This difference is likely to be related to the study period, as the latter survey was performed before the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic (January to June 2019). It may also be related to the diversity of professional categories participating in ALADDIN, presenting different levels of QWL.",

Cultural specificities may also play a role, as shown in other research areas such as perception of happiness [44] . These specificities may be linked to differences in people's work-related representations and expectancies.

These differences were however of modest magnitude and did not exceed 3 points in QWL scores. Further research is needed to determine if such a magnitude exceeds the minimum important difference for the WRQoL scale. Executives showed both the best overall QWL and higher scores in the \"Home-work interface\" and \"Job and career satisfaction\" dimensions of QWL, compared with that of other professional categories. Along with older age, correlated with less domestic responsibilities related to child care, a longer experience of night-shift work may explain the greater ability of executives to find the right balance between their professional and personal lives. By contrast, executives (together with midwives) presented a low score of QWL in the \"Stress at work\" dimension, revealing higher levels of stress than other professional categories. Interestingly, midwives reported the lowest QWL related to working conditions. Further research should thus be performed to identify midwives' specific needs and expectations to both improve their QWL and prevent psychosocial risks [45] . Of \u2666 This variable was not entered in the multivariable analysis due to a high rate of NSHW in the \"not concerned\" category. 1 The other possible answers to this item of the questionnaire included \"never\", \"rarely\", and \"from time to time\".",

For instance, workers with more night-shift work experience may better cope with stress than those with less experience.

Second, the choice of the study period, which directly followed the first wave of COVID-19 in France (March to June 2020), is adequate to assess NSHW's perceptions during the pandemic. Indeed, once their work overload started to decline after the peak of the crisis, NSHW were more prone to both share their feelings and experiences, and to assess the repercussions of the pandemic on their QWL. Lastly, the ALADDIN survey explores a large panel of potential correlates of QWL, using a standard scale (WRQoL).",

Further research is therefore needed to assess longitudinal changes in QWL among NSHW throughout the pandemic, and in the long term. Another limitation of our study is the lack of comparative data among dayshift hospital workers. Such data would have helped distinguish between the effects of shiftwork by itself on QWL and those related to coping with the pandemic. Future surveys should include both populations of hospital workers. Of note, external factors such as the time of day the questionnaire was completed may have influenced NSHW's answers (notably due to fatigue). This type of bias, inherent to self-reported data, is difficult to take into account in the analyses. Indeed, a potential \"time of the day\" effect depends on many unmeasured factors, including NSHW's number of hours worked before completing the questionnaire, their workload, and inter-individual variations in the internal clock (some individuals feel awake late at night, whilst others are sleepy).",

In line with this strategy, a national observatory was created in 2018 to monitor QWL among healthcare and medico-social workers. The COVID-19 pandemic has further stressed the need to document QWL in healthcare services, and to identify its determinants during and after such sanitary crises [47] . Findings from the AP-HP ALADDIN survey contribute to increase the body of knowledge about these key issues, which are central to set up efficient strategies to reinforce healthcare systems. Such strategies should include interventions aiming to improve recognition, reduce stigma related to night-shift work, and to improve information and communication between the different groups of healthcare workers.",
