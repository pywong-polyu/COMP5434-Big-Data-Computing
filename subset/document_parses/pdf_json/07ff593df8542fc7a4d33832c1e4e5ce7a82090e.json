The mathematical models give important information about various parameters and their effects on different modes. These models help us in the estimation of the parameters and the evaluation of their sensitivity. But these traditional modelling and mathematical analysis are insufficient in the case of infections which are caused due to different strains of the virus. Coronavirus disease 2019 or simply COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 i.e., severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. In Wuhan, a city of China, the very first case was identified during December 2019. Now it has been spreading worldwide very quickly. COVID-19 took only a few days to expand from a city (Wuhan) to various parts of the rest of the World. The spreading rate of COVID-19 is too high, which includes imported cases in travellers, transmitted cases of \"no-mask\", cases of close contacts of two or more known infected persons. The shortfall of PPE (personal protective equipment) and ventilators have been increasing the stress rate on healthcare management",

Chaudhuri & Bhattacharyya [14] also have described the correlation formula between fuzzy sets. To calculate the correlation, intuitionistic fuzzy sets (IFSs) [15] , [16] & [17] have also been used. Bustince and Burillo [18] provided a formula to measure the correlation between two IFSs. Later, [19] also introduced a correlational formula on IFSs. An application [20] summarized the advantage of the correlation coefficient and compared it with Xu's correlation coefficient [21 & [22] . These studies show the advantages of intuitionistic fuzzy correlation over the traditional fuzzy correlation and also show that the IFSs are positively or negatively related and their extensions over interval-valued IFSs have also been studied. When we deal with the crisp data, it is easy to find the correction coefficient, but when the observations are fuzzy then it is quite difficult to find the best suitable technique to calculate the correlation coefficient between fuzzy or IFSs.",

But when the information taken from various sources is partially or completely contradictory and if the knowledge base system changes with time and non-contradictory information is converted into doubtful or contradictory information. By using the fuzzy logic system or intuitionistic logicbased system we cannot deal with this noncontradictory, contradictory information with some hesitancy. Montiel et al. [23] provided a new slant that can deal with these kinds of contrary information and provided a logical solution, called the mediative solution. Later, [24] have also used the concept of mediative fuzzy logic in the administration of contradictory knowledge and show the capability of mediative fuzzy logic. The mediative fuzzy logic has also been applied in the medical field [25] & [26] . In this present work, we have developed a correlation technique based on mediative fuzzy logic and the value of the mediative correlation coefficient computed from our formula provides us the strength of the relationship of mediative fuzzy sets. Based on this technique, we also have predicted the upcoming cases in India by the end of December 2020.",

The aim of taking these five states of India is due to the variation in their geographical, economical, topographical, climatic and their diversified nature. The proposed model provides a comprehensive technique for the prediction of the COVID-19 pandemic in India. After a closer study of the lockdown periods during a COVID-19 pandemic, it is observed that the proposed technique plays an important role in the prediction of COVID-19 in the present contrary environment. The mediative fuzzy correlational value for Delhi is about 0.30, results in, as the time increases the amount of COVID-19 infected patient increases. By the end of the year 2020, the possible number of infected patients will lie in the range of six lacs, but if the people are following the social distancing follow the guideline used by ICMR (India) and isolation rules then it may reduce the effect of COVID-19 infections. On the other hand, the mediative fuzzy correlation value for Uttar Pradesh lies in between the interval [0.21, 0.4092]. So, it also indicates that the positive mediative fuzzy correlation, results in, the number of patients increases with the time and the total infected patient at the end of 2020 will be approx. 5.5 lacs. In Karnataka, the fuzzy correlation value is low, but people still not following the instructions provided by the World Health Organization, results in, the patient still increasing rapidly in Karnataka state. The approximated value of infected patients is five lacs, but if the people do not restrict the close contact with other people, then it may increase the spread of COVID-19 in Karnataka. On the behalf of the study of other states, the overall infected patients in India will be approximately 35 million at the end of the December 2020. But if the people follow the instructions used by the government regarding COVID-19 and go along with the isolation process in the society and observe a proper instruction chart and if the people include a hygienic diet plan, then it may reduce the spread rate of COVID-19 pandemic in the globe and may reduce jeopardy of the epidemic in the globe. The Present model will help the people in the prediction of this epizootic disease in the contrary and vague environment.",
