Vaccine shortage poses relevant challenges to health authorities, called to act promptly with a scarcity of data. We modeled the mortality reduction of the elderly according to a schedule of mRNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccine that prioritized first dose administration. For the case study of Italy, we show an increase in protected individuals up to 53.4% and a decrease in deaths up to 19.8% in the cohort of over 80's compared with the standard vaccine recalls after 3 or 4 weeks. This model supports the adoption of vaccination campaigns that prioritize the administration of the first doses in the elderly.",

The vaccination campaign has, therefore, prioritized this age group, whose immunization in Italy began on Monday, February 8, 2021 with difficulties due to various delays in the supply of the two approved mRNA vaccines (Pfizer/BNT Biotech and Moderna) initially dedicated to this cohort.

However, when excluding cases of infection in the first 14 days after the first dose (the time needed for an effective immune response against the vaccine antigen), the same trial studies showed a good efficacy from the first dose alone: 92.6% (4) and 92.1% (3) for Pfizer/BNT Biotech and Moderna, respectively. A recent Israeli study also estimated first dose effectiveness (protection assessed in the real world, usually lower than efficacy) of 85% (95% CI 71-92) in reducing symptomatic COVID-19 cases (5) . This data was confirmed in a study conducted in Scotland on healthcare workers (6) . More recently, another study proved the efficacy of 57% (95% CI 50-63) from 14 to 20 days after the first dose and 66% (95% CI 57-73) from 21 to 27 days after the first dose (7) . To date, the available data on vaccine efficacy against transmission is limited. However, an interim estimate of vaccine effectiveness of Pfizer/BNT Biotech and Moderna vaccines proved adjusted vaccine effectiveness against infection of 80% and 90%, respectively, 14 days after the first and second dose (8) . What is well-known is that the vaccine reduces the symptomatic forms of COVID-19, thus also decreasing both the number of severely affected patients requiring admission to the ICU and deaths.",

In addition, the study explains how memory B cells develop properly following the administration of mRNA vaccines, supporting the idea that further enhancement of antibody production is stimulated by a second dose of vaccine given up to 6 months after the first (14) . Similarly, recent epidemiological modeling studies on SARS-CoV-2 showed the effectiveness of single dose vaccination strategy in containing the pandemic more rapidly (15) . The debate is still ongoing among scientists and public health policymakers at both the national and international level (16, 17) . The US CDC stated \"There is no maximum interval between the first and second dose for either vaccine (Pfizer/BNT Biotech and Moderna). Therefore, if the second dose is administered >3 weeks after the first Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine dose or >1 month after the first Moderna vaccine dose, there is no need to restart the series\" (18) .",

In Figure 1 , we report the pattern of vaccinated individuals under these two schedules over a 7 weeks period for only the Pfizer/BNT Biotech vaccine. The first 3 weeks are the same for both schedules. Afterward, under the standard schedule, the available doses will be reserved and used for the second vaccination of subjects who already been vaccinated, to the detriment of other individuals over 80-years-old not yet vaccinated, who will have to wait while remaining at risk.",

Considering the latency of 2 weeks necessary to evoke an efficient immune response (and assuming a first dose effectiveness of 80%), with this strategy a total of 2,920,000 people will be protected at week 9 according to the model. If we assume a constant weekly mortality rate of \u223c4 fatalities per 10,000 people in this age group [update as of March 10, 2021 (18) ], there will be 7,061 deaths in the same cohort from week 3 to week 9. Conversely, following the alternative schedule (i.e., the strategy of prioritizing first doses to all individuals of the cohort before moving on to second doses), 3,727,330 people will be protected and a total of 5,664 deaths in the cohort are expected in the same time interval, i.e., a 27.6% increase of the protected and a 19.8% reduction of deaths, which notably is independent of the assumed mortality rate. The benefit is evident even when considering vaccine effectiveness of 60% and a different number of weekly vaccinations (refer to Table 1 and Figure 2) , the simple reason being the number of protected growing at a very different pace when the first doses or the second doses are administered.",

Notably, in the plot (C), the number of protected individuals increases much more slowly over time with the standard schedule (red and orange line), plateauing at week 5 because second doses are being administered at that time. Instead, under the alternative schedule (blue and green lines), protected individuals increase linearly in time, with a possible bending when the number of weekly doses is so large that second doses administration start before week 7, as indicated by the black curve in the plot (D).

By prioritizing first dose administration, we estimated up to a 19.8% decrease in deaths in the cohort of over 80's, in case of effectiveness after the first dose of 80%, and a 6.9% decrease under the worst scenario of the effectiveness of 60%. This study has some limits. First, the data on vaccine efficacy was mainly derived from the total population, while this study focused on a cohort, namely the elderly, where the vaccination could be less effective. We proposed scenario 2 with low first dose effectiveness of 0.60 \u00b1 0.10 to adjust for this aspect while still showing the usefulness of this model. Second, available data on efficacy and effectiveness mainly refer to a shorter time frame after the first dose, 4 weeks at most. In this model, we assumed a non-significant reduction of vaccine effectiveness at 11 weeks at most, as such a period may be required in case of vaccine shortages. Third, we do not embed this vaccination campaign into a formal susceptible-infectedrecovered (SIR) based epidemiological model, as we assume the same virus circulation in the short time window considered when only the elderly are vaccinated. Such an embedding is a challenging task that would be likely be required to model longer time horizons and a population-wide vaccination coverage (25) . Finally, we remark that this model focuses on the Italian scenario, which we consider as representative of other countries facing similar conditions in terms of infection rate, mortality, and vaccine supply, namely, the key parameters considered in this model. Overall, these findings suggest considering the vaccination option of prioritizing first doses in the elderly until the vaccine supplies are adequate.",
