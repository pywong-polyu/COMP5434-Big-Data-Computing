This situation is still considered a relative contraindication in the 2014 updated International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation consensus document for the selection of LTx candidates. 2 Overall, these patients are known to have worse perioperative outcome and inferior long-term survival. 3 Therefore, the LTx community in general has been reluctant to accept such patients on their waiting list because of the increased risk to waste good organs and the competition with stable and electively listed patients with a better chance for good post-transplant outcome.",

Recipient outcome was compared with 1423 electively listed transplant recipients. Not surprisingly, death at any time after listing, including post-transplant death, was higher among urgently listed patients. These patients were younger (53 AE 13 vs 55 AE 12 years), had more ventilator and extracorporeal support (25% vs 2%), had more restrictive lung disease (73% vs 51%), and had a higher Lung Allocation Score (82 AE 13 vs 47 AE 17). Of note, at 1 month after listing, mortality was 26% in urgently listed patients and 58% received transplants versus only 2.1% and 20%, respectively, in the electively listed patients. However, in-hospital morbidity and mortality, survival up to 7 years, and allograft function were similar in a matched comparison of both groups with 76 patients each using weighted balancing-score methodology. 4 This report is one of the largest single-center studies focusing on outcome in urgently listed LTx candidates. How to understand that outcome was similar in both matched groups? We believe this was related to the definition of urgently listed, determined as previously not evaluated as an outpatient before listing, whereas the electively listed patients were identified in this study by the date of listing preceding the date of hospital admission for transplantation. After all, both groups consisted of ''urgent'' patients with comparable disease severity in terms of age, diagnosis, Lung Allocation Score, and life support, but their date of listing differed.",

            "text": "Nevertheless, this retrospective study by the Cleveland group on a large patient cohort is interesting as their findings shed new light on the ongoing discussion whether patients with acute respiratory failure and urgent referral for rescue transplantation should be listed at all. A limitation of the study acknowledged by the authors is the unknown proportion of patients who were not referred or were not listed for LTx at all. Therefore, the results presented in this paper represent only a portion of well-selected patients believed to be still able to undergo transplantation with a reasonable outcome. Series on successful LTx in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome, for example, after a serious viral infection, are rarely reported. 5, 6 In our LTx program at the University Hospitals Leuven, Belgium, we have been reluctant to list patients with acute pulmonary deterioration who were previously not seen in the clinic or not screened for transplantation. Nevertheless, such patients are always discussed and evaluated by a multidisciplinary team on an ad hoc and case-by-case basis. Young patients who survive the critical period in the intensive care unit and who can be rehabilitated may still be considered for elective transplantation in case their pulmonary function and exercise capacity remain limited without any other medical or surgical options for further improvement. As discussed in the International Society of Heart and Lung Transplantation consensus document, 2 these patients will need careful reevaluation to determine candidacy for LTx taking into account not only physiologic findings but also psychosocial factors, family support, and fully informed patient consent that cannot always be obtained upon referral when critically ill.",
