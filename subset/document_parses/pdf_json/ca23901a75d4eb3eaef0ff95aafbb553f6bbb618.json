In this paper, we evaluate the validity of wait time complaints submitted via PG surveys in an ophthalmic emergency department (ED) and determine the effect of trainee presence on total time spent in the ED and negative PG comments. Materials and Methods: This was a retrospective study evaluating PG reports for ED demographic, diagnostic, visit time and trainee involvement trends. Results: Females made up 48.0% (4465) of overall ED patients yet submitted 62.8% (98) of the negative comments on PG surveys. More than a quarter (27.7%) of the negative comments pertained to wait time. Patient-reported times spent in the ED were significantly longer than actual total ED times (p < 0.001). Both reported and actual total ED times were significantly longer for patients who submitted wait time negative comments than those with other complaints (p < 0.001 vs p = 0.039, respectively). Patients seen by residents spent a significantly longer time in the ED than those seen by non-resident providers (p = 0.015), although self-reported total ED times did not differ significantly in these patients (p = 0.467).",

Overall, this demonstrates patient complaints about wait times are likely valid and trainees such as residents may play a role in slowing down clinic flow.

Of note, females submitted more negative comments than their male counterparts. This difference in response rates to patient satisfaction surveys by gender has been demonstrated in the literature, and it may be extrapolated that this variation applies to survey comments as well. 2, 4 The majority of patients who submitted negative comments were treated by a management team that included a resident. At the institution studied, ED patients are triaged by the charge nurse according to the Emergency Severity Index (ESI), with optometrists evaluating patients with ESI levels 3-5 during daytime working hours and ophthalmology residents and attendings evaluating patients with all ESI levels 24 hours a day. A prior study conducted at an academic ophthalmology department revealed decreased efficiency for outpatient appointments in the presence of trainees, with appointments with residents being 32% longer than those without residents. 10 Based on our analysis, this finding also applies to the ophthalmologic ED setting. Inclusion of residents in management teams was associated with a longer time spent in the ED, which may be a result of the need for collaboration, multiple exams, and longer times taken to complete a history and exam at the trainee level. Interestingly, the patient self-reported total ED time was not significantly different based on inclusion of residents in the management team. A possible explanation may be that the presence of residents decreases the time to initial provider contact, creating the perception of decreased waiting time and thus decreased overall time spent in the ED. Nonetheless, these findings demonstrate the difficult balance between maintaining trainee education and providing efficient care for patients.",

However, patients complaining about wait time did spend significantly longer in the ED than those with other complaints. Prior literature has demonstrated that longer wait times correlate with patient complaints in EDs, although to our knowledge, this data does not exist for ophthalmic EDs. 13 A limitation of this study was a low response rate. Only 92 of 9304 patients visiting the ED within the specified time range submitted negative comments. Patients were invited to complete PG surveys via an email following their visit, and while comments were invited, they were not required. Thus, the comments studied are likely unrepresentative of all patients visiting this institution's ophthalmic ED. Furthermore, management team information was only available for 38 of the 92 patients, and thus, conclusions about the effect of trainee presence may also not be entirely representative of the population. The short time span for which data was collected hinders the ability to generalize these findings. This is particularly true considering the impact COVID-19 may have had on the ED volume, patient demographics, and complaints for which patients presented to the ED. Also, this study incorporated data from only one institution, so findings may not accurately represent populations at other institutions and geographical regions with varying racial and ethnic compositions, medical literacy, and availability of ophthalmic EDs.",
