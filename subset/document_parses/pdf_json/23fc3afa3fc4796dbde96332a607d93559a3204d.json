            "text": "The CRISPR-Cas12a RNA-guided complexes have tremendous potential for nucleic acid detection but are limited to the picomolar detection limit without an amplification step. Here, we develop a platform with engineered crRNAs and optimized conditions that enabled us to detect various clinically relevant nucleic acid targets with higher sensitivity, achieving a limit of detection in the femtomolar range without any target pre-amplification step. By extending the 3\u2032-or 5\u2032-ends of the crRNA with different lengths of ssDNA, ssRNA, and phosphorothioate ssDNA, we discover a self-catalytic behavior and an augmented rate of LbCas12amediated collateral cleavage activity as high as 3.5-fold compared to the wild-type crRNA and with significant improvement in specificity for target recognition. Particularly, the 7-mer DNA extension to crRNA is determined to be universal and spacer-independent for enhancing the sensitivity and specificity of LbCas12a-mediated nucleic acid detection. We perform a detailed characterization of our engineered ENHANCE system with various crRNA modifications, target types, reporters, and divalent cations. With isothermal amplification of SARS-CoV-2 RNA using RT-LAMP, the modified crRNAs are incorporated in a paper-based lateral flow assay that can detect the target with up to 23-fold higher sensitivity within 40-60 min.",

This attribute, known as trans-cleavage, is only activated once bound to an activator (ssDNA or dsDNA) that has complementary base-pairing to the guide crRNA. When combined with a FRET-based reporter, a fluorophore connected to a quencher via a short oligonucleotide sequence, the presence of the target activator can be confirmed. This phenomenon has been efficiently harnessed by SHERLOCK (Specific High-sensitivity Enzymatic Reporter unLOCKing) and DETECTR (DNA Endonuclease Targeted CRISPR Trans Reporter) to reliably detect nucleic acids 1, [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] .",

We placed ssDNA, ssRNA, and phosphorothioate ssDNA extensions of various lengths ranging from 7 to 31 nucleotides on either the 3\u2032-or 5\u2032-ends of the crRNA targeting GFP (green fluorescent protein), referred to here as crGFP (Fig. 1b-h) . To measure the collateral or trans-cleavage activity of Cas12a, we employed a FRET-based reporter used in DETECTR 1 , composed of a fluorophore (FAM) and a quencher (3IABkFQ) connected by a 5nucleotide sequence (TTATT), which displays increased fluorescence upon cleavage. Consistent with the previous literature 13 , when using wild-type crRNAs, we observed that the LbCas12a exhibited higher trans-cleavage activity than the AsCas12a or the FnCas12a, and therefore, we designed various modified crRNAs compatible with LbCas12a. Using the same reporters, we discovered that ssDNA and ssRNA extensions on the 3\u2032-end of crGFP markedly enhanced the trans-cleavage ability of targetactivated LbCas12a. Comparing the two types, the ssDNA extensions demonstrated higher activity than the corresponding ssRNA ( Fig. 1b -d, f and Supplementary Figs. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] . On the other hand, the phosphorothioate ssDNA extensions at the 3\u2032-end or 5\u2032-end displayed minimal or no activity, showing decreased fluorescence intensity as modification length increased (Fig. 1e , h and Supplementary Figs. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] . This observation suggests that further extending the crRNA with 13-mer phosphorothioate ssDNA and beyond significantly inhibits LbCas12a trans-cleavage activity. The finding corroborated B. Li and colleagues that phosphorothioate ssDNA may prevent crRNA-Cas12a-DNA complex formation 14 .",

By investigating the conformational changes from the crystal structure of the binary LbCas12a:crRNA complex 12, 15, 16 , we observed that the 3\u2032-end modifications on crRNA are proximal to the RuvC region of the LbCas12a. This supports our observation that the 3\u2032-end extensions lead to higher trans-cleavage activity than the 5\u2032-end. We hypothesized that the reporter composition itself may affect the LbCas12a collateral cleavage activity. Therefore, we incorporated and tested various nucleotides (GC and TA-rich) and fluorophores (FAM, HEX, and Cy5) within the reporter. Consistent with our hypothesis, we observed that the LbCas12a achieved maximal trans-cleavage activity with FAM or HEX and TA-rich reporter ( Fig. 2a and",

These remaining extensions may further expand the nuclease domain in the LbCas12a, resulting in conformational changes and allowing more access for nonspecific ssDNA cleavage. To confirm our hypothesis, we attached different fluorophores, or fluorophore-quencher pairs separated by DNA linkers, to either the 3\u2032-end or 5\u2032-end of the crGFP with 7-mer DNA extensions and analyzed by denaturing gel electrophoresis.

To validate the CRISPR-ENHANCE technology, we first selected a clinically relevant nucleic acid biomarker, Prostate Cancer Antigen 3 (PCA3/DD3), which is one of the most overexpressed genes in prostate cancer tissue and excreted in patients' urine. Consequently, elevated PCA3 level during prostate cancer progression has become a widely targeted biomarker for detection [21] [22] [23] [24] . To determine the limit of detection of PCA3 using our ENHANCE technology, we spiked the PCA3 cDNA into synthetic urine and investigated how this clinically relevant environment affects the activity of Cas12a.",

[19] [20] [21] . In contrast, the wild-type crRNA also showed a similar 29 fM limit of detection at 13 mM Mg 2+ concentration while the limit of detection was~10 pM at 3 mM Mg 2+ concentrations after 6 h. Therefore, by combining the crRNA modifications with increased Mg 2+ ion concentrations, we achieved an approximately 400-fold increase in sensitivity, based on the limit of detection calculations. Nevertheless, this observation also suggests that our modified crRNA + 3\u2032DNA7 significantly improves the limit of detection at low Mg 2+ but reaches a saturation point that is comparable with the wild-type crRNA at high Mg 2+ concentration. To understand the importance of divalent ions in the Cas12a trans-cleavage reaction, we carried out a Michaelis-Menten kinetic study with various Mg 2+ concentrations ( Supplementary Fig. 19 ).

This curiosity led us to discover that the wild-type crRNA had significantly reduced activity in detecting methylated DNA, containing 5-methyl cytosine, compared to the unmethylated DNA.

To test this hypothesis, we incorporated a reverse transcription step to convert RNA into cDNA/RNA heteroduplex before detecting the RNA with a transcleavage assay. We discovered that the RNA can only be detected if the target strand for crRNA is a DNA but not an RNA in a heteroduplex. Notably, the efficiency of the trans-cleavage activity for the DNA/RNA heteroduplex was found to be significantly lower than the corresponding ssDNA or dsDNA (Fig. 5e,  Supplementary Fig. 22b) . However, the DNA/RNA heteroduplex achieved an improved enzymatic collateral activity when using the crRNA + 3\u2032DNA7 compared to the wild-type crRNA. We applied the ENHANCE to successfully detect low picomolar concentrations of HIV RNA target encoding Tat gene with our DNA/RNA heteroduplex detection strategy (Fig. 5f ). In parallel, ssDNA and dsDNA targets from HIV were also detected with much higher sensitivity compared to the wild-type crRNA within 15 to 30 min (Fig. 5f, g and Supplementary Fig. 23 ). We further applied the ENHANCE for detecting HCV ssDNA and HCV dsDNA gene encoding a polyprotein precursor, both of which indicated consistent enhanced collateral activity than the wildtype crRNAs within 24 min (Fig. 5f -h and Supplementary  Fig. 24 ).

We observed a much higher fluorescence intensity when using ENHANCE than the unmodified CRISPR in a very short amount of time, within 10 min, for detecting targets. When we applied the system on a lateral flow assay, the positive band was visible only after 30 s, whereas it took over 1 min to show up using the unmodified crRNA.

Two guide RNAs were employed to target two different regions of the SARS-CoV-2 N-gene (referred to as N1 and N2 regions). The N1 region of SARS-CoV2 was selected to have \u22642 sequence mismatches with SARS-CoV and bat-SL-CoVZC45. This target region was therefore used to recognize if SARS-like coronaviruses strains are detected. The region N2 was selected from Broughton et al. 28 that was specific for SARS-CoV-2 for exclusivity testing (Fig. 7a) . We first targeted SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV, and bat-SL-CoVZC45 plasmid controls (purchased from IDT) using these two crRNAs. The engineered N1:crCoV2 + 3\u2032DNA7 and N2: crCoV2 + 3\u2032DNA7 showed 3-fold and 7.8-fold higher in fluorescence signal compared to the wild-type N1:crCoV2-WT and N2: crCoV2-WT after 10 min of incubation, respectively. Notably, the engineered N1:crCoV2 + 3\u2032DNA7 exhibited lower in fluorescence signal against MERS-CoV and bat-SL-CoVZC45, demonstrating 74% enhanced specificity towards SARS-CoV-2 (Fig. 7b, c) .

When detecting the samples with low copies, we observed that unmodified CRISPR exhibited a very small sensitivity ratio between the activator positive and the activator negative samples, which led to difficulty in distinguishing if the target dsDNA was present in these samples. However, with our ENHANCE, the activator positive samples displayed a very intense signal compared to activator negative samples, confirming a higher signal to noise ratio. The 7-mer DNA extension to crRNA is universal and spacer-independent, which means that it can be added to any crRNA without affecting the fidelity of the CRISPR/Cas12a system or significantly affecting the cost of synthesis.",

We applied this modified crRNA-LbCas12a system with the optimal conditions to detect PCA3 in simulated urine with high sensitivity. This ENHANCE technology enabled us to detect the DNA:RNA heteroduplex and methylated DNA with unprecedented sensitivity. We further employed this system to test a range of target nucleic acids, including ssDNA, dsDNA, and RNA from HIV, HCV, and SARS-CoV-2 without the need for further optimization. Compared to wild-type CRISPR, the ENHANCE demonstrated enhanced detection of SARS-CoV-2 genomic RNA with improved sensitivity and specificity in a fluorescence-based assay and a paper-based lateral flow assay.
