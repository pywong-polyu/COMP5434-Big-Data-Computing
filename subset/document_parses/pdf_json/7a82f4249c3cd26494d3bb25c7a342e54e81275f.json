In a few weeks, more than a hundred thousand cases and thousands of deaths were confirmed globally and their number has been increasing with each day (Garfin et al., 2020) . The coronavirus Covid-19 outbreak is the most important global health crisis of our time and the biggest challenge we have faced since the Second World War. Countries try to slow the spread of the virus by testing and treating patients, tracking contacts, limiting travel, quarantining citizens and cancelling large meetings such as sports events, concerts and schools. Every day, people lose their work and income without knowing when their normal will return, or they are negatively affected by this epidemic psychologically (United Nations Development Programme, 2020) . Covid-19 has brought about extremely difficult and stressful situations and events for the world and Turkey.",

These are; a) risk and/or difficulty, b) positive adaptation, coping, competence and c) protective factors. In this case, resilience is \"a phenomenon that occurs as a result of the pronounced interaction of protective factors associated with healthy adaptation and contributing to this adaptation process with existing risk factors\" (Windle, 1999) . It is observed that resilient individuals who can cope with difficulties, easily recover from difficult situations and are psychologically flexible possess some certain characteristics. Krovetz (1999) talks about four basic characteristics of resilient individuals. These characteristics are; (1) Social competence: Ability to create positive impressions in others and thus to establish positive relationships with both adults and their peers. (2) Problem solving skills: Skills necessary to ask for help from others and to plan activities to occur under one's own control. (3) Autonomy: Ability of a person to possess his/her own identity, to behave independently and to establish control on his/her environment. (4) Having goals and sense of future: Sense of having some goals, educational expectations, hope and bright future.",

It can be expressed as the ability to sustain healthy reactions in other stressful situations as a result of giving healthy reactions to stressful life events (Reich et al., 2010) .

These individuals participate in social changes and activities, they are faithful; many have the ability to extract meaning and benefits from the troubles, traumas and worries in their lives. The existing research has revealed that resilience is associated with problem solving (Neenan & Dryden, 2012) ; stress and exhaustion (Hao et al., 2015) ; locus of control (Dunn & Brody, 2008) ; family support (White et al., 2008) ; social support (Nikmanesh & Honakzehi, 2016; \u015e ahin Baltac\u0131 & Karata\u015f, 2015) ; hope (Duggal et al., 2016) ; pessimism and positive affectivity (Tugade & Fredrickson, 2004) and life satisfaction (Akbar et al., 2014; \u015e ahin Baltac\u0131 & Karata\u015f, 2015) ; depression (\u015e ahin Baltac\u0131 & Karata\u015f, 2015) , self-esteem and hopelessness (Karatas & Savi-\u00c7akar, 2011) , hope and life satisfaction (Shetty, 2015) ; life satisfaction, stress and social support (Yang et al., 2018) .",

Emotions reflect the perceived level of hope, and therefore people with high levels of hope are more positive, happier, optimistic and have better coping skills when reaching their goals.

In addition, hope is a positive state of motivation oriented to the target (Eliott & Olver, 2002; Folkman, 2010) . Research shows that hope is positively correlated with coping with stress (Folkman, 2010); meaning in life (Kim et al., 2005) ; pessimism, self-efficacy and well-being (Magaletta & Oliver, 1999) .

People want to feel safe and have control over their lives. Fear and uncertainty can make people feel stressed, anxious, and weak.

Research to be carried out in this period is important to determine the effect of this situation on people. One of the most important results obtained from the current study is that individuals with more hope were found to be more resilient during the pandemic which includes difficult living conditions. Another variable that positively predicts resilience is meaning in life. This shows that adults who have high hopes and find meaning in their life have more resilience. Wong (2012) determined that individuals with a high level of hope who find meaning in their lives under difficult life conditions cope well with these conditions and are more resilient. In addition, Wu (2011) states that hope and meaning in life encourage individuals to cope with difficult situations and also that hope is an emotion that affects the meaning in life in difficult life events. It is known that individuals with high levels of hope during fear periods also have high levels of resilience. According to the studies in the literature, it is seen that hope and meaning in life have a positive relationship with resilience in difficult periods of life. This seems to be in compliance with the findings obtained in the current study.",

In other words, the greater the gap between the level of individual wishes and the current state of the person, the lower the satisfaction (Pavot & Diener, 1993) . Resilience is the person's ability to achieve biological-psychological-cognitive balance when confronted with dangerous conditions and this is associated with life satisfaction (Conner & Davidson, 2003) . The individuals who are dissatisfied with their life will have negative perspectives of life and the problems they will encounter in their life. Therefore, it is an expected result that life satisfaction is positively associated with resilience. In addition, there are some studies revealing that resilience is associated with self-esteem and hopelessness (Karatas & Savi-\u00c7akar, 2011) ; psychological well-being (Ifeagwazi et al., 2014) ; life satisfaction (Akbar et al., 2014; Jokar, 2007; \u015e ahin Baltac\u0131 & Karata\u015f, 2015) ; meaning in life and hope (Halama, 2014; Kim et al., 2005) ; hope and life satisfaction (Shetty, 2015; Yang et al., 2018) and hope (Duggal et al., 2016) .",

These variables predict resilience negatively. As is known, people experience more stress in situations which they cannot control and predict. In other words, uncertainties about when something will happen, what it will be or what its results will be cause more stress in individuals, and hope is an important factor in coping with this process (Kirmani et al., 2015) . Uncertainty increases fear, and these days when Covid-19 fear is common, individuals appear to be worried the most because of uncertainty (Garfin et al., 2020) . People who are intolerant of uncertainty find uncertainty stressful and frustrating and believe that uncertainty is negative and should be avoided; thus, they experience difficulties in situations that create uncertainty. It is known that people experience uncertainty during the Covid-19 pandemic process, and in this case, individuals' resilience levels are expected to be low (Robichaud, 2013) . Similarly, Lee (2018) revealed that individuals with high levels of intolerance of uncertainty have low levels of self-regulation skills, interpersonal relationships, positive tendencies and resilience. According to the results of the current study, there is a significant negative relationship between intolerance to uncertainty and Covid-19 fear and resilience and this result concurs with the literature.",

In the current study, it was aimed to identify the factors that can be particularly effective in dealing with difficult situations such as Covid-19 pandemic period and developing resilience and thus to provide guidance for future studies. On the basis of the results of the current study, it was concluded that in difficult periods such as Covid-19 pandemic period, people's finding meaning in their lives, having high levels of hope and life satisfaction positively affect the level of resilience while intolerance of uncertainty and Covid-19 fear negatively affect. For this reason, studies aimed at increasing the resilience level of individuals can be organized through trainings on hope, meaning in life and life satisfaction. In addition, since the presence of childhood psychological traumas negatively affects resilience, education to be given to families about raising their children will also be effective. The participants of the current study are adults; similar studies can be carried out with children and adolescents.",
