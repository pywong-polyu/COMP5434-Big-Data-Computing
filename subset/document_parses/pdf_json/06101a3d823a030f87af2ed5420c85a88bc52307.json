The sample consisted of 2,307 older adults (38% men and 62% women). The results indicated that older adults presented less concern about the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as less adherence to preventing procedures in the first wave, compared to subsequent evaluations. In addition, greater depressive symptoms, anxiety and stress were found in older adults in the last wave; however, the proportion of older adults identified with high scores in these variables was lower than that reported in national data.",

By March 30, the General Health Council declared the epidemic of the disease generated by the SARS-CoV-2 virus (COVID-19) as a health emergency (13) and, on March 31, the extraordinary actions to address this emergency were published (14) . According to these documents, the immediate suspension of non-essential activities in the public, private and social sectors, until April 30, was established aiming to mitigate the spread and transmission across the communities, to reduce overrunning of the health system and the rates of severe cases and deaths in the population residing in the national territory (15) .",

The system works as follows: red light indicates that only essential economic activities can operate; orange light that, in addition to essential economic activities, companies considered as non-essential are allowed to work with 30% of their personnel, and open public spaces may operate with a reduced capacity of people; with yellow light all work activities are allowed with due precautions, and open spaces may operate regularly, though public enclosed places must operate with a reduced capacity of people; finally, green light indicates that all activities, including physical attendance to school, are allowed.",

Regarding occupation, the highest proportion of participants reported doing household chores and a second large proportion of them reported being unemployed. More than a third of the participants indicated having at least one of the following conditions: hypertension, diabetes, cancer, respiratory and autoimmune diseases, obesity, or dyslipidemia. A similar percentage reported not having any of the evaluated conditions, and approximately one fifth indicated having two or more conditions (see Table 1 ). Personnel from the Direction for the Welfare of Older Adults, consisting of nurses, social workers, psychologists and doctors, were trained for the instruments' application via telephone. Older adults were informed about the objective of the study, were inquired concerning their understanding of their participation, and asked to state if they agreed to participate in the study. Older adults who agreed to participate in the study were asked a couple of questions (\"What date is today?\", or \"Where are you right now; for example, in which town?\") to assess their sense of space and time aiming to provide evidence of sufficient cognitive capacity. In addition, the criteria and experience of the interviewer were considered (because they are professionals who work with this population everyday), to determine if the older adults were answering consistently each of the questions. The interviewers were instructed that they could interrupt the interview if they considered that there were inconsistencies or incongruities in the responses of participants.",

The first area contains four items that evaluate how much older adults have followed hygiene and social distancing measures to prevent infection by COVID-19, as well as the usefulness that these prevention measures have. The second area contains two items that assess both how often older adults seek information about the course of the pandemic, as well as the trust they have on that information. The area of concern about COVID-19 contains four items that assess the concern that older adults feel about themselves or a member of their family becoming infected and about their economic situation and security issues in their communities as a result of the pandemic. The perception of impact by COVID-19 is assessed with an item that asks older adults how much their daily lives have been affected by the pandemic. The last area of this questionnaire assesses the perception of the elderly regarding the care provided by their family from the start of the COVID-19 contingency. Participants were instructed to respond to each of these questions in a 0-to10 scale.

Furthermore, concerning the indicators on monitoring and perceived utility of social distancing measures, a significant decrease was identified from the second to the third wave.",

Specifically, at baseline, older adults reported having a lower concern of infection, both for them and their families, as well as a lower concern for security aspects in their community as a result of the pandemic. Likewise, the results showed that older adults reported lower impact of the pandemic on their daily life in the first evaluation than in the two subsequent waves, between which no significant differences were found. No significant difference was observed in this regard between the second and third wave. Results also showed that older adults reported greater concern in the second wave, compared to the first and third waves. Finally, results of the questionnaire indicated significant differences between the three waves in relation to perceived family care; specifically, perceived care was higher in the second wave compared for the first one, though the score dropped again in the third wave (see Table 2 ).",

The findings showed that, overall, older adults reported lower scores of concerns about COVID-19 in the first wave than in subsequent waves. Although significant differences were not found in all cases between the second and third waves, the data showed a general increase in scores in the second one, which then dropped again by the last wave; however, while the scores dropped, they did not go back to the scores of the first moment. These results could be due to the moment that was being experienced, since there was a substantial increase in cases and deaths due to COVID-19 in the country (17) during the second wave. That is, the second wave was carried out at a time characterized by a significant increase in the number of cases and deaths; in addition, between 2 and 3 weeks had passed in within the third phase of the pandemic, where non-essential activities had been suspended in the country. By the third wave of this study (where scores decreased again), almost 4 months had passed since the start of the \"new normal\" phase, and although there were already a significant number of cases and deaths from COVID-19 (23), it appears that older adults progressively habituated themselves to an environment characterized by illness and death. Regarding symptoms of depression, anxiety and stress, older adults presented the highest scores in the third wave, compared to the previous evaluations; however, in the case of stress, no significant differences were found between the first and second waves. In this sense, the comparison analyses between the proportion of adults who could be classified as having high scores for stress, anxiety and depression, also showed significant differences, where the proportion of older adults identified with significant symptomatology (according to the scales' cut-off scores) was higher within the third wave.",

            "text": "It is important to note that the percentages found were lower than those reported in national surveys, at least for depressive symptomatology, since this is the one for which information is available at a national level in this population. For example, the National Institute for Older Adults (52) suggests that depression is the most frequent affective disorder in people over 60 years of age in Mexico, and that it is present in 15-20% of the older adult population. Similarly, the National Health and Aging Survey 2018 (ENASEM), reports that 30.6% of the population aged 50 years or older, report five or more depressive symptoms, with women being the ones reporting more of these types of symptoms (37.2%) in contrast to men (21.9%) (53). In the present study, the highest percentage of older adults who were classified with high scores in depressive symptoms were 4.6% (data from the third wave), which is a percentage far below from what is reported at a national level, although we should not lose sight of the fact that the severity of depressive symptoms tends to worsen over time and that, most likely, we are only witnessing the natural course followed by this condition, given the situation that was experienced, without it having reached significant levels yet. In addition to this, it is interesting that, although the evidence pointed to an alarming situation, mainly in terms of the number of cases and deaths, that would justify the presence of certain levels of stress, anxiety and depressive symptoms as part of an adaptive process to the prevailing situation, the narrative imposed by the federal authorities presented a different reality; that is, the messages issued indicated that the pandemic was under control, and that in a short time the situation would return to normal, which generated a sense of certain tranquility and relaxation on the part of the population.",

This is consistent with a report by R\u00f6hr et al. (30) , where no changes in mental wellbeing related to the pandemic were found in a sample of older adults and, although some concern about the situation was reported by these participants, they also reported high perceived social support which could have allow them to cope with the adverse conditions of the pandemic.",

The participants were older adults included in a welfare program by the government of the State of Mexico, and thus are characterized by low income and, most likely given the demographics of this region of the country, residing in places with medium-to-low conditions of living, suggesting at least some homogeneous characteristics. A second important limitation is the fact that the interviews were conducted via telephone, and thus responses could have been biased from both the part of the respondent and the interviewer, since non-verbal information was not available. Besides, returning to the problem of sample representation, it is likely that we excluded an important sector of the population that has no access to a telephone line. We tried to control possible interviewer bias by providing training on the administration of the questionnaires.",

Thus, the present research provides evidence regarding the changes in the mental health of Mexican older adults, contributing to the monitoring of mental health during this pandemic, particularly in vulnerable populations, and also adding to the international evidence to be used in cross-cultural comparative studies.",
