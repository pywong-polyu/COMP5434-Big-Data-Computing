The role of the PHC in this huge project was large but in fact it differed somewhat between countries. The gatekeeping role was of enormous importance, making early diagnoses and assisting people who were worried about this pandemic. Also, among the most crucial roles of PHC was to protect the hospitals from being overloaded [1].",

More indirect communication took place via telephone, web consultation and telemedicine. The experience gained from these means of communication is generally positive and will undoubtedly have an impact on how the PHC will conduct its future relations with its clients. This is in line with the tendency seen in many other countries [2] .",

Antibiotic overuse and particularly the over prescribing of antibiotics for children being of extreme importance in PHC [3, 4] . It seems that in Iceland, the use of antibiotics among children decreased during the first wave of covid-19, from March to May 2020 [2] . There might be two reasons for this. Firstly, simply it could have been due to fewer infections, and secondly, this could be the effect of less access to healthcare that was spending most of its time dealing with Covid-19. The 2m social distancing rule was mandatory and hand washing and limiting public and private gatherings no doubt had an effect as well.",

The ban on visits to nursing homes has in many cases caused great discomfort to the residents' relatives. On the other hand, restrictions on travel between countries have had a positive effect on domestic travel. Thus, Icelanders have significantly reduced travel abroad and instead supported the domestic tourism industry. This means that people get better acquainted with their own country and at the same time spend far less foreign currency abroad.",

How and when the Covid-19 pandemic will come to an end is still not known but persistent symptoms are already well-known among patients who have been infected with Covid-19, even among patients with mild symptoms of the infection. Post-acute covid-19 is an emerging task for PHC [5] . Approximately 10% of Covid-19 patients can be expected to persist with symptoms three weeks after being diagnosed with Covid-19. These symptoms vary widely and among the most common are cough, fatigue, low grade fever, shortness of breath and depression. As the Covid-19 is a multisystem disease, with thromboembolic being one, some of these patients might have develop a life-threatening disease such as pulmonary embolism. Thus, this task is very challenging. These patients need comprehensive wholepatient assessment, involving a team of different professionals including general practitioners, nurses, psychologists, social workers, physiotherapists and others.",
