Consequently, an early lesson for policy makers is that investment in research needs a complementary focus on enhancing study rigor and inclusivity. Given that physician referrals are a key determinant of trial enrollment, rethinking the engagement of clinicians in community practice -who have long been disengaged from clinical research -could help to steer patients toward clinically appropriate and well-designed studies.1",

First, because of the nature of MIPS, clinicians eligible for the CMS incentive by definition have a substantial number of Medicare beneficiaries in their patient panels. Given that elderly people have been disproportionately affected by the virus, incentivizing reporting to clinical data registries can help to inform risk assessments and care planning for older adults, especially those with specific comorbidities (e.g., cancer, kidney disease) that are associated with increased susceptibility to infection and adverse outcomes. For example, 63 health systems and community practices had enrolled in the American Society of \" Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Survey on Covid-19 in Oncology Registry through the MIPS incentive as of December 2020.3 Second, while >2,000 clinical trials had been initiated for Covid-19 as of December 2020, representation of older adults has been lacking.4 , 5 The MIPS trial incentive could facilitate the enrollment of elderly patients and help to accelerate the completion of these trials. Third, the initial drugs considered for Covid-19 patients included already-available products like hydroxychloroquine, leading some physicians to prescribe them \"off-label\" for Covid-19 treatment or prevention. But such real-world use will not help to answer the question of whether the product actually works, as observational data may not be available for clinical study for some time and observational data sets are challenging to use in determining product effectiveness. For repurposed drugs, the CMS policy incentivizes clinicians to instead participate in clinical trials (e.g., National Institutes of Health [NIH]-sponsored trials) and report data to verified repositories or registries.",

First, most Covid-19 clinical trials have thus far occurred in inpatient settings because of a focus on hospitalized patients with severe illness. These trials are inaccessible to many MIPS-eligible clinicians, the majority of whom practice in ambulatory care settings and are unaffiliated with health systems or major teaching hospitals.6 While outpatient recruitment may be relevant for potential prophylactics and some therapeutics, the site-of-service restrictions on Covid-19 treatments to date may have limited the participation of MIPS-eligible clinicians. Additionally, the CMS policy is flexible about which trial designs are redeemable for MIPS credit, ranging from traditional randomized trials to pragmatic designs. These eligibility criteria may be too broad, leading the Medicare program to reimburse clinicians for participating in insufficiently rigorous studies. Furthermore, clinicians who might most benefit from higher MIPS scores (e.g., independent practices and those caring for underserved patients) may face the highest barriers to participating, given that involvement in clinical trials is a resourceintensive endeavor.6 , 7 Last, while financial incentives for registry participation already exist in MIPS, extending such incentives for clinical trials recruitment and reporting may present ethical concerns, particularly if this financial conflict of interest is not disclosed to patients.",

Clinical leaders and health care administrators responsible for quality measurement and reporting for their organizations will need to alert the providers in their network about the CMS policy and communicate the process of attestation for the designated QPP reporting period to be eligible for the incentive payment. To achieve the policy's intended public health goals, health systems also will need to help their clinicians and practices register for the appropriate registry for reporting Covid-19 data (e.g., the jurisdiction-specific immunization registries outlined in states' draft Covid-19 vaccine playbooks).8 Furthermore, health systems will need to develop a pathway for extracting the relevant clinical data from their system's electronic health records and ensure that the necessary data elements (e.g., demographic information) are captured and appropriately structured for submission and use.",

For example, given that clinicians can self-select the improvement activities that they use for attestation, the disproportionate performance benefit accrued from participating in Covid-19 clinical trials may lead to gamesmanship of MIPS scores, undermining the program's primary focus of fostering quality improvements. With MIPS payment adjustments set to increase from 4% to 9%, policy makers must ensure that incentives are appropriately calibrated to avoid inadvertently undermining the program's purpose. The trials incentive also may exacerbate the documented disparity in MIPS scores between system-affiliated and independent clinicians as the former are better positioned to participate in trials or clinical registries because of the network effects of health system affiliations for clinical research.6",

First, increasing participation in clinical registries aligns with MIPS' goals to promote interoperability and advance care quality. Likewise, given that MIPS-eligible clinicians generally practice in community-based settings, extending CMS' pandemic-era clinical trial program may increase the accessibility of clinical research beyond Covid-19. In tandem, the expanding footprint of hospitals in outpatient health services, the uptake of decentralized clinical trial models during the pandemic, and the creation of provider networks for Covid-19 vaccination programs give health systems the building blocks for advancing clinical research partnerships with public and private payers. For example, UnitedHealth Group has partnered with Eli Lilly to study the use of monoclonal antibodies in a Medicare Advantage population during Covid-19, providing an example of how payers and providers can expand access to research and treatment for a specific (and often underrepresented) patient population.9",

At baseline, CMS should solicit and act on the feedback of clinicians and implement policies for disclosure to patients. The agency could consider limiting payment reforms for clinical trials to select indications for which there is documented underrepresentation of Medicare beneficiaries. For example, heart disease is highly prevalent among Medicare beneficiaries and nearly triples their risk of hospital admissions and doubles the annual cost of care per beneficiary.10 However, older adults remain underrepresented in clinical trials for cardiovascular disease, even after the adoption of the Inclusion Across the Lifespan policy.11 Targeted incentives through MIPS could help to address this disparity in clinical research, especially given that the American College of Cardiology's Chest Pain -MI and CathPCI registries were both eligible for the Covid-19 improvement activity, fostering awareness among eligible clinicians and hospitals about future opportunities for supporting outcomes measurement and clinical research for this patient population.12",
