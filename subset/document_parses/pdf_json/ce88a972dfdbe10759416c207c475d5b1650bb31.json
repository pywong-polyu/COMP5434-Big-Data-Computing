            "text": "With few treatment options available to manage coronavirus disease 2019 (covid- 19) , the disease presents a unique set of challenges for healthcare providers globally. In addition to using non-drug interventions, health systems have devised strategies to manage covid-19 using repurposed drugs and revisiting older strategies, such as convalescent plasma. In the past, convalescent plasma was used as a passive immunisation strategy to treat viral diseases, raising expectations that potentially it could be used to treat severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus responsible for covid-19 and a disease with no proven, effective interventions. 1 Convalescent plasma is a source of antiviral neutralising antibodies. Other immune pathways, such as antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity, complement activation, or phagocytosis are putative mechanisms through which convalescent plasma might exert its therapeutic effect in patients with covid-19. 2 Additionally, anti-inflammatory cytokines, defensins, pentraxins, and other immunomodulatory proteins might have a role in alleviating systemic inflammatory response syndrome, the main pathophysiological basis for acute respiratory distress syndrome and mortality from covid-19 related pneumonia. 2 In the pre-vaccine era, convalescent plasma was used to treat viral diseases such as poliomyelitis, measles, mumps, and influenza, and, more recently, influenza, Ebola virus disease, and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus epidemics, with varying degrees of success. [3] [4] [5] [6] Evidence suggests that convalescent doi: 10 .1136/bmj.m3939 | BMJ 2020;371:m3939 | the bmj plasma collected from survivors of covid-19 contains receptor binding domain specific antibodies with potent antiviral activity. 7 However, effective titres of antiviral neutralising antibodies, optimal timing for convalescent plasma treatment, optimal timing for plasma donation, and the severity class of patients who are likely to benefit from convalescent plasma remains unclear.",

[8] [9] [10] [11] [12] Only two randomised controlled trials on convalescent plasma use in covid- 19 have been published, one from China and the other from the Netherlands. 13 14 Both were stopped prematurelythe China study because of inadequate patient enrolment, and the Dutch study because interim findings highlighted the need for a redesign of the trial. Neither study found a mortality benefit, and the Dutch study raised uncertainties about the pretransfusion antibody status of patients as a potential factor in identifying appropriate candidates for convalescent plasma treatment. 14 This uncertainty in the published evidence was reflected in a recent systematic review, which remained undecided on both the safety and the effectiveness of convalescent plasma as a treatment option in patients admitted to hospital with covid-19. 15 Meanwhile, convalescent plasma treatment has received regulatory approval for use in patients in several countries. This has resulted in its widespread adoption in real world clinical practice, where it is being used to treat patients with a wide spectrum of covid-19 severity. 16 17 Given these uncertainties, we determined the effectiveness and safety of convalescent plasma in patients with moderate covid-19 admitted to hospitals across India to limit progression to severe disease.",

In that trial, a subgroup of 45 patients with severe disease, similar to patients with moderate disease in our study, showed increased clinical improvement in the convalescent plasma group. 13 The ConCOVID trial from the Netherlands, prematurely terminated after 86 patients had been enrolled, could not find any effect on mortality at 60 days, hospital stay, or disease severity at 15 days. 14 A large observational study advocated the usefulness of convalescent plasma to treat covid-19, reporting that 7 day mortality and 30 day mortality were lower in those who received convalescent plasma within three days of symptom onset. However, the absence of a controlled comparator weakens these findings as evidence of ( efficacy. 26 Although our study was underpowered, we did not find any benefit from convalescent plasma being administered within three days of symptom onset in covid-19.",

The difference in age and severity of illness between participants, with donors being younger and having milder disease, could have driven this difference. Although all survivors of covid-19 were encouraged to donate plasma, most of the donors were young and only had mild disease. Recovered patients who had moderate or severe disease were generally reluctant to return to hospitals for plasma donation. This has major implications for obvious operational reasons in the scaling up of convalescent plasma treatment for covid-19 not only in India but also globally.",

Three deaths could possibly be related to transfusion, which is comparable to the other larger report on safety of convalescent plasma use to treat covid-19. 12 In our study we defined a \"possible\" adverse event as a clinical event that occurred within six hours of convalescent plasma transfusion but could also be explained by worsening covid- 19. 23 Strengths and limitations of this study Our trial (the PLACID Trial) was conducted to generate context specific evidence relevant to all stakeholders, including policymakers, healthcare providers, and patients. To achieve this, we invited an expression of interest from hospitals across India, not just a few centres of excellence. Hospitals were chosen from both the public and the private sectors, lending heterogeneity in infrastructure and wide social, cultural, and economic representation of study participants, with a large range of comorbidities and presenting features. The best standard of care represented the care standards likely to be provided in a real world setting. Although this approach could have affected comparability across study sites, we believe this lends the trial more generalisability, approximates real world scenarios more closely, and in the methodological spectrum of clinical trials, shifts it towards pragmatic trials.",

This might be reflected in the higher resolution of subjective symptoms such as shortness of breath and fatigue noted in the intervention arm. The trial was conducted in 39 hospitals across India, with some level of heterogeneity across the trial sites for best standard of care and participant enrolment. The biomarker assays for ferritin, lactate dehydrogenase, C reactive protein, and D-dimer were conducted using tests from different manufacturers. Also, as the pandemic was in different stages across the country, the numbers enrolled varied between sites, with a possibility of selection bias arising from clustering of enrolment. We dealt with this bias by statistically adjusting the primary outcome for trial sites. Furthermore, the discharge criteria for covid-19 was based on Indian government guidelines and not on clinician discretion and patient condition, hence we chose not to analyse discharge as a secondary outcome. We could not measure the antibody titres in convalescent plasma before transfusion because validated, reliable commercial tests for qualitative or quantitative antibody measurement were not available when our trial started. However, this practice remains a close approximation of the manner in which convalescent plasma treatment has largely been used in regions with limited laboratory capacity.",

Areas of future research could include effectiveness of convalescent plasma among neutralising antibody negative patients and the use of convalescent plasma with high neutralising antibody titres.
