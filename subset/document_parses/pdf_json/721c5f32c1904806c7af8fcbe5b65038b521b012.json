In section 3, we describe the data resource and our approach to segmentation of lungs and GGOs. In section 4, we present results on detection, segmentation, abnormality predictions, and shape and size analyses of GGOs. Section 5 contains conclusions. \u00a72 Related work Rapid and accurate segmentation of CT scans to assess the severity of the disease in COVID-19 patients presents several challenges for ML methods: blurring due to low contrast in intensities of infected and normal tissues, significant variations in infection features, and insufficient training data. In CT scans of COVID-19 patients, GGOs appear at the periphery of both lungs. The pixel intensities of GGOs and soft tissue are nearly the same, which makes it difficult for non-clinicians to delineate GGOs and soft tissue regions. Various groups have proposed conventional and advanced ML approaches to segment the lung regions. In [8] , a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) Mask R-CNN approach is combined with Bayes, Support Vectors Machine (SVM), K-means, and Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) to segment lungs in CT scans. This combined supervised and unsupervised ML approach has an accuracy of 97.68 \u00b1 3.42% and an average runtime of 11.2 seconds for lung segmentation. The results are not surprising because the images are CT scans of healthy patients and therefore not too complicated for segmentation. In [9] , the authors utilized a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) for lung segmentation in CT images. Note that GAN is commonly used for data augmentation and synthesis. The images presented in [9] are only from healthy lung scans. There are no signs of infections on those lung scans. Infected lung scans contain diffused regions, which are much harder to segment by ML algorithms. In [10] , a random walker algorithm is used for lung segmentation. In this approach, a gray value is randomly sampled, and the GMM is used to compute the clustering probability. Subsequently, a random walker map is constructed by combining the clustering result with the spatial distance to compute new edge weights. The authors of [10] tested their methodology on 65 CT scans and reported 97% to 99% accuracy for two different datasets. A CNN-based architecture was proposed for lung segmentation in [11] . The authors reported a 98.5% dice coefficient value for this study. Recently, the Inf-Net architecture consisting of multiple convolutional, up-sampling, and down-sampling layers was developed for lung segmentation and applied to datasets of COVID-19 patients [12] . The results for GGO segmentation do not match very well with the ground truth, which indicates that this approach requires further improvements and more training data. Table 1 summarizes ML studies of lung segmentation in CT scans of healthy and COVID-19 patients.",

Therefore, supervised deep learning (DL) approaches such as Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) or Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) cannot handle the complexity of the raw 3D data for lungs and GGOs in CT scans. We have circumvented this problem by using an unsupervised DL approach to segment GGOs in unlabeled MosMedData. For algorithmic processing, we extract 2D slices from 3D data while retaining the ability to reconstruct the 3D volume whenever required. Our 3D lung scans are available in Neuroimaging Informatics Technology Initiative (NIfTI) format. We applied the correct windowing filters to retain the regions of interest (ROIs), i.e., whole lung regions and GGOs. We use image processing operations to segment CT images irrespective of how they are coded for healthy and diseased cases. To do this effectively, we first remove skeletal and other background objects from an image slice using a simple thresholding algorithm (see S1 File) with the minimum and maximum values of the image intensity set between 117 and 255, respectively. Next, the resulting image is fed to a marker function which separates the lung from other background objects using morphological operations such as dilation and erosion (see S1 File). The dilation operation makes the lung regions more prominent by filling any small gaps, and the erosion operation removes any unnecessary objects. Lastly, we apply a structuring element operation to fill any gaps missed by the dilation operation (see S1 File). The output is a binary image with '1' representing the lung regions and '0' representing the background.",

An expanded view of the GGO region is shown in Fig 7 ( see S1 File) (bottom panel). The binary masks generated for lung segmentation misses GGO regions. Hence, we applied a convex hull algorithm (see S1 File) to preserve the actual anatomical structure of the lungs. The convex hull algorithm detects convex points around the outer surface of both lungs. The inner surface of the lungs was left untouched. Fig 1 shows the workflow for lung segmentation. The original image ( Fig 1A) and its binary mask leave an incomplete structure of the lung because the pixel intensities of GGO and soft tissue regions are very similar to each other and hard to delineate. Moreover, some parts of the lung are missing after masking. We apply the convex hull algorithm (see S1 File) to address these problems caused by masking. The convex hull detection results are shown in Fig 1C. The red dots around the edges of both lungs represent convex points. Next, we computed pairwise Euclidean distances and drew a green line if any pairwise distance was less than 80 pixels (this value may vary with the dataset). We connected the missing GGO regions from the segmented lung images in such a way that the original lung structure was restored (Fig 1D and 1E ). Finally, we converted the binary mask into an RGB mask using bitwise operation between binary masks and original images.",

We computed the abnormality of individual regions of the segmented lung and GGOs (described in section 3.1) using a CNN network presented in Fig 5. This network is the same as VGG-16 except for the first four convolution layers which were reduced to two. These architectural changes achieved better performance. The first four convolution layers of the VGG-16 network accept images of size 224 x 224 pixels and 112 x 112pixels. Our input data size is 512 x 512pixels. To accommodate our images into VGG-16, we had to resize the image. But resizing large images into smaller sizes at the initial stage has a chance of information loss. Hence, we have replaced the four convolution layers with two layers. Accordingly, we have changed the kernel size and max-pooling operations. Moreover, in the VGG-16 network, the final layer is the fully connected layer. In our case, the final layer is the Cox layer, which computes abnormality scores. If we use exactly the VGG-16 network, we will not be able to compute abnormality scores. The CNN network is comprised of multiple convolutions, max-pooling, and dense layers at the end of the network. Rectified linear units were used after each convolution layer, and an adaptive learning technique with log-likelihood loss functions was used for the training of the network. The dropout was set at 0.5, the initial learning rate to 0.001, and the model was trained up to 60 epochs.",

The regions containing GGOs or some other malignant signatures like a tumor nodule were deemed high-abnormality regions. Fig 5A shows the CNN architecture for automated abnormality classification, and the workflow diagram of the methodology is shown in Fig 5B.

Therefore, we use Minkowski tensors to characterize the shapes of GGOs [34, 35] . Minkowski tensors are based on the mathematical foundations of integral and stochastic geometry. A simple example of shape representation by a tensor is the moment of inertia of a rotating body about an axis. Generalizing the concept of volume, surface area and local curvatures, Minkowski tensors quantify the morphologies of anisotropic objects in terms of shape indices. Minkowski functionals are rank-2 tensors and have four independent real-valued components in d = 2 spatial dimensions and six in d = 3 dimensions. For a three-dimensional object K with the surface @K, the six tensor components are given by, ",

Geometric methods have been developed for biological shape analysis, and shape-based methods have been used for diagnosis of lung nodules [36] [37] [38] . Minkowski tensor-based shape analysis is a new approach to analyze shapes of GGOs. They have been used in general theory of relativity and materials science. Highly efficient algorithms have been developed to compute Minkowski tensors in linear time (URL: www.theorie1.physik.uni-erlangen.de), and they have been used to characterize a variety of systems: (a) surface force microscopy images of co-polymer films and X-ray tomography images of open-cell liquid foams; (b) models of liquid foams and granular materials consisting of spherical beads; and (c) defect structures in molecular dynamics simulations of metals.",

The results are shown in Fig 6. The probability distribution in Fig 6A indicates a peak around -600 HU and a tail extending to -150 HU for GGOs in the dataset. A majority of GGOs in the dataset lie in the tail region corresponding to high-abnormality scores in the heatmap of Fig 5. The average area and perimeters of GGOs in image slices are 3821 and 578, respectively. The \u03b2 1 index is around 0.85, which indicates 15% asphericity for GGOs. The isoperimetric ratio is 0.144. Among the moments, q 3 and q 6 are the largest and the dipole moment q 2 is the second largest. We also computed the radial distribution function, g(r), and pixel radius and normalized integrated intensity ( Fig  6B) . The radial distribution function lies between 90 and 150 pixels, peaking around 120 which indicates that pixels in GGOs are correlated over long distances. \u00a75 Conclusion",

Instead of modeling all the pixels of a GGO, we use point cloud feature learning in which a small fraction of pixels is sampled randomly and the 3D shape of a GGO is faithfully reconstructed. In addition to its efficiency, our approach has the benefit of representing the local neighborhood of a point using features that can be used in downstream ML algorithms. The accuracy of PointNet++ in detecting GGOs is 98%, the average class accuracy is 95%, and the intersection over union is 92%.
