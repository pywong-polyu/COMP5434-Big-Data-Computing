Here, we present 971 globally distributed surface ocean metagenomes collected at high spatio-temporal resolution. Our low-cost metagenomic sequencing protocol produced 3.65 terabases of data, where the median number of base pairs per sample was 3.41 billion. The median distance between sampling stations was 26 km. The metagenomic libraries described here were collected as a part of a biological initiative for the Global Ocean Ship-based Hydrographic Investigations Program, or \"Bio-GO-SHIP.\" One of the primary aims of GO-SHIP is to produce high spatial and vertical resolution measurements of key state variables to directly quantify climate change impacts on ocean environments. By similarly collecting marine metagenomes at high spatiotemporal resolution, we expect that this dataset will help answer questions about the link between microbial communities and biogeochemical fluxes in a changing ocean.",

Projects such as the Global Ocean Survey, Tara Oceans, and bioGEOTRACES 1-3 have significantly advanced our understanding of marine microbial biogeography and biodiversity. However, this ever-increasing abundance of metagenomic data raises the question of how do we move beyond analyses of biodiversity to linking microbial traits with ecosystem function and elemental fluxes 4 . In oceanography, it has been widely acknowledged that sparse sampling results in high noise and error rates that in turn prevent the characterization of dynamic chemical balances and limit biogeochemical models 5 . Thus, we propose that an increased emphasis on high resolution spatio-temporal sampling of marine microbial communities would allow for a more mechanistic understanding of the relationship between microbes and ocean biogeochemistry.",

Compared to autonomous programs such as Argo, which has significantly increased the spatial and temporal resolution of ocean observations 6 , ship-based programs have the advantage of a much broader range of biogeochemical measurement capabilities and full water column coverage. To date, repeat hydrography programs have largely focused on physical (light, currents, water column thermohaline structure, etc.) and chemical (nutrients, oxygen, dissolved organic and inorganic carbon, pH, etc.) state variables. This work has significantly improved our understanding of the response of oxygen 7 , pH 8 , calcium carbonate saturation depth 9 , and sea level rise 10 to global warming and anthropogenic carbon accumulation 11 .

Samples were collected in the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Ocean basins (Fig. 1 , Table 1 ). This effort has been supported by GO-SHIP, SOCCOM, the Plymouth Marine Laboratory Atlantic Meridional Transect (PML AMT), and three National Science Foundation (NSF) Dimensions of Biodiversity funded cruises (AE1319, BVAL46, and NH1418) ( Table 2) . Whereas the median distance between Tara Oceans sampling stations was 709 km and the median distance between bioGEOTRACES sampling stations was 191 km, the median distance between sampling stations in the current Bio-GO-SHIP dataset is 26.5 km (Fig. 2 ). In addition, the majority of Bio-GO-SHIP samples were collected every 4-6 hours, allowing for analysis of diel fluctuations in microbial composition and gene content 12 . We anticipate that our high-resolution sampling scheme will allow for a more detailed examination of the relationship between the broad range of geochemical parameters measured across the various cruises (Table 2 ) and microbial diversity and traits.",

This dataset provides an important example of the benefits of a high spatial and temporal resolution sampling regime. In addition, our data highlights the need for increased sampling of marine metagenomes in the Central and Western Pacific Ocean (Fig. 1) , areas above 50\u00b0N and 50\u00b0S (Fig. 2) , and below the euphotic zone.
