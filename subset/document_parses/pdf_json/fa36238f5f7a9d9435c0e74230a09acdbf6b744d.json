Even in controlled DCD donors, however, a protracted warm ischemia time occurring in the perimortem period might damage organs, making these unsuitable for transplantation. Implementing a strategy of extracorporeal interval support for organ retrieval (EISOR), a regional reperfusion with normothermic, oxygenated blood provides a physiologic environment allowing extensive assessment of potential grafts, and potentially promotes recovery of native function. Here we report the results of a multi-center retrospective cohort study including 29 Maastricht Category III controlled DCD donors undergoing extracorporeal support in a regional DCD/EISOR Training Center, and in the network of referring In-Training Centers, under the liaison of the regional Transplant Coordination Center during COVID-19 pandemic, between March 2020 and November 2021. The study aims to understand whether a mobile, experienced EISOR team implementing a consistent technique and sharing its equipe, expertise and equipment in a regional network of hospitals, might be effective and efficient in implementing the regional DCD program activity even in a highly stressed healthcare system.",

            "text": "Donation after confirmation of death according to circulatory criteria, 1 namely donation after circulatory death (DCD) 2 has evolved in recent years as an effective strategy to retrieve organs for transplantation, expanding donors pool while achieving results comparable with transplantation after confirmation of death according to neurological criteria. 3 Donation after circulatory death donors are conventionally defined as controlled (cDCD), if permanent cessation of circulation is expected, or uncontrolled (uDCD), if irreversible circulatory arrest is unexpected, occurring after failure of resuscitation attempts. 4 Specifically, according to the modified Maastricht Classification, 4,5 category III DCD donors experience cardiac arrest (CA) after planned withdrawal of life-sustaining therapy (WLST), as life support is no longer considered as being in the best interests of the patient. Futility is typically related to devastating brain injury, not fulfilling criteria for brain death (BD). 1, 4, 6, 7, 8 In DCD donors, however, a protracted condition of warm ischemia might damage organs, making these unsuitable for transplantation. 7 In their recent consensus statement, 9 the European Society for Organ Transplantation (ESOT) recommends to use normothermic regional perfusion (NRP) of the abdomen cDCD procedures, rather than in-situ cooling and cold static storage, if ethical, technical and logistical requirements are met, to improve recipients outcome, potentially preventing some post-transplant complications. 9, 10 Normothermic regional perfusion, or extracorporeal interval support for organ retrieval (EISOR), according to the Extracorporeal Life Support Organization (ELSO) nomenclature, 11 is an in-situ strategy of postmortem splanchnic re-perfusion with normothermic blood between declaration of death and organ retrieval. The implementation of EISOR allows to limit warm ischemia time, to evaluate potential grafts function mimic in-vivo settings, and potentially to revert ischemic damage (timeline of events in DCD donors is detailed in Figure 1 ). Nevertheless, EISOR is a demanding approach requiring specific competencies and equipment in order to overcome technical challenges, fully respecting legal and ethical boundaries. 7, 9 We report a regional experience of EISOR delivery in Italy, aimed to share expertise and, when/as required, human and material resources. This organizational strategy resulted in an effective mean to persist in running and furtherly strengthen a DCD program despite resource constraints in time of pandemic. A positive impact on the availability of organ for the purpose of transplantation is reported.",

We consider warm ischemia time starting with agonal period, as mean arterial pressure drops below 50 mmHg or peripheral saturation drop below 50% (whichever occurring first).

During pandemic, successful experiences of expanded ECMO capacity sharing experienced personnel, technologies and specific material resources, 28 or offering supervision and training by experienced ECMO providers to newly established centers have been reported worldwide. 29 These recommendations and experiences could be interpreted in a broad sense and translated to any form of extracorporeal support, including EISOR. We demonstrated the feasibility of mobile EISOR team implementing normothermic reperfusion in cDCD donors according to a consistent strategy. To date, there is no consensus on reperfusion settings at EISOR initiation and during the run, and uneven blood flow/target MAP, and gas flow rates, as FdO 2 are used 9 : we implemented a technique based on physiological considerations derived form cardiopulmonary bypass guidelines and adapted to the postcirculatory arrest settings, according to experiences with extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation. During EI-SOR, a favourable trend for pH, normalizing, and lactate, dropping or consistently decreasing (Table 1) was observed, potentially suggesting effectiveness for these perfusion settings. However additional evidence is required, particularly to define an optimal length for reperfusion, in order to furtherly improve outcome without increasing the risk of potential EISOR related complications.",
