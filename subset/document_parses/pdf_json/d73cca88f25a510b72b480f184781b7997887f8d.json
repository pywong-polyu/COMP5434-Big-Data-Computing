Eighty-eight healthy individuals without radiological evidence of acute lung disease served as controls. Two radiologists selected up to four regions of interest (ROI) per patient (totaling 1,475 ROIs) visually regarded as well-aerated regions (472), ground-glass opacity (GGO, 413), crazy paving and linear opacities (CP/LO, 340), and consolidation (250). After balancing with 250 ROIs for each class, the density quantiles (2.5, 25, 50, 75, and 97.5%) of 1,000 ROIs were used to train (700), validate (150), and test (150 ROIs) an artificial neural network (ANN) classifier (60 neurons in a single-hidden-layer architecture). Pulmonary involvement was defined as the sum of GGO, CP/LO, and consolidation volumes divided by total lung volume (TLV), and the cutoff of normality between controls and COVID-19 patients was determined with a receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve. The severity of pulmonary involvement in COVID-19 patients was also assessed by calculating Z scores relative to the average volume of parenchymal opacities in controls. Thus, COVID-19 cases were classified as mild (<cutoff of normality), moderate (cutoff of normality \u2264 pulmonary involvement < Z score 3), and severe pulmonary involvement (Z score \u22653).",

In fact, such effect was demonstrated, and the hexagon with a radius of 2 mm seemed to be the best dimension for grouping voxels maintaining a good performance of the classifier, although there was a slight reduction in agreement both in overall and within classes ( Table 1 ) when compared to ANN performance in the confusion matrix.

The overlapping zone between GGO and CP/LO and the important dispersion of voxel densities (Figure 4) are probably related to the presence of GGO in the background of CP/LO (3), contributing to reduced ANN performance between these classes. In addition, it is possible that the separation between GGO and CP/LO depends on the scale used for sampling purposes. In fact, a hexagon with a larger radius, therefore grouping a greater number of voxels, tended to reduce the agreement for GGO (from 81 to 61% for hexagons with 2mm and 4-mm radii, respectively), whereas it increased the concordance for CP/LO (from 70 to 80% for hexagons of 2-mm and 4-mm radii, respectively).",
