Building off the affordance lens and cognitive load theory, we investigate how motivational factors and personal attributes influence social media fatigue and the sharing of unverified information during the COVID-19 pandemic. Accordingly, we develop a model which we analyse using the structural equation modelling and neural network techniques with data collected from young adults in Bangladesh (N = 433). The results show that people, who are driven by selfpromotion and entertainment, and those suffering from deficient self-regulation, are more likely to share unverified information. Exploration and religiosity correlated negatively with the sharing of unverified information. However, exploration also increased social media fatigue. Our findings indicate that the different use purposes of social media introduce problematic consequences, in particular, increased misinformation sharing. 2018; Mele et al., 2017) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1100, "end": 1118, "text": "Mele et al., 2017)", "ref_id": "BIBREF56"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "COVID-19 was not only a global pandemic but according to the director of WHO, also an \"infodemic\", highlighting dire issues arising from the abundance of misinformation and fake news circulating about COVID-19 (Laato et al., 2020a) . In response to the infodemic, a significant number of resources were directed to curb the spread of misinformation; to ensure the availability of reliable information about COVID-19 to the public (Zarocostas, 2020) . Among the adverse effects observed during the infodemic were messages of inefficient government (Mahase, 2020) and individual-level (Vaezi, and Javanmard, 2020) responses. Another concerning observation was health issues such as cyberchondria or increased anxiety (Farooq et al., 2020) . Previous work has highlighted social media to play a crucial role in the spread of misinformation (Allcott and Gentzkow, 2017) which calls into question what the platforms could do to prevent the spread of fake news (Figueira and Oliveira, 2017) . Consequently, the three main research areas concerning fake news are divided into (1) the (technical) prevention of the spread of fake news; (2) the impacts of misinformation; and (3) the relationship between misinformation and population health (Laato et al., 2020a) .

Recent studies have also pointed out that social network sites are often used for selfpromotion and exhibitionism purposes (Islam et al., 2019) . As such, social network sites differ from instant messaging, which is more personal, less self-promoting, more direct and driven by a wish to maintain and develop relationships (Quan-Haase and Young, 2010) . Modern social media platforms such as Facebook offer multiple ways in which people can interact, including social activities, instant messaging, photo sharing, video streaming and sharing of news and articles. The social media ecosystems can cause or reinforce the stratification of people into social sub-groups characterised by having a similar mind (Guerra et al., 2013) . This is the result of individuals' own choices due to psychological tendencies as well as AI-based recommendation systems that aim to provide users content they are likely to enjoy (Spohr, 2017) . The lack of critique on thoughts and the amplification of radical ideas by the virtual echo-chambers created by social media have been claimed to contribute to increased dissemination of misinformation (Barber\u00e1 et al., T During COVID-19, clear communication of the severity of the situation and recommended health measures was needed to ensure people took correct action and did not suffer from unnecessary anxiety (Farooq et al., 2020) . The abundance of unclear, ambiguous and inaccurate information during COVID-19 led to information overload and accelerated health anxiety (cyberchondria) as well as misinformation sharing (Laato et al., 2020a) . As social media amplifies the spread of news, and people read news through links shared on social media (Allcott and Gentzkow, 2017; Thompson et al., 2019; Ku et al., 2019) , understanding the role that social media plays on the sharing of misinformation is essential. In this setting, social media fatigue (SMF) and its connection to misinformation sharing may reveal further insights into human behaviour on social media and the antecedents of the spread of misinformation. Thus, our research aims to observe this relationship as well as personal attributes and motivational factors connected to the two constructs via the theoretical frameworks of affordances (Norman, 1988) and cognitive load theory (CLT) (Sweller, 2011) . With our paper, we expand the existing literature on misinformation sharing by connecting it to the affordances of social media and SMF.

While information is available, it might not be clearly structured, organised or even accessed. Previous studies have given four primary reasons for this: (1) a proportion of the available information is misinformation; (2) much of the available information is irrelevant; (3) information entropy: information is poorly organised and presented; and (4) information overload, there is simply too much information for humans to make sense of (Pentina and Tarafdar, 2014; Laato et al., 2020a) .

As such, attempts to algorithmically detect and sensor fake news articles from social media would result in a large number of false positives and false negatives, contributing to censorship that would still leave some room open for fake news to be displayed.

These findings show promise in how social media platforms could influence peoples' news sharing and reading behaviour. Another recent article proposed the use of crowdsourcing to fact-checking news as well as confirming their authenticity (Pennycook and Rand, 2019) . In a way, crowdsourcing of news articles is already in place. Wikipedia, for example, can be regarded as a crowdsourced database of information. However, news articles need to be produced and disseminated rapidly, which means that measures for detecting fake news also need to be quick. The problem in general with currently available suggestions for curbing the spreading of misinformation is that there begins to be a trade-off.

In the context of a door handle, it has the logical affordance of being used to open a door. The door handle may be used in other ways as well, such as rubbing the back or being used as a clothing stand. Gibson (1977) stated that affordances are independent of the actors' ability to recognise them. Norman (1988) thought this expansion to the concept of affordance was unnecessary, and re-defined affordances to be only those actions, which an individual realises to exist. In doing so, affordances were tied to the objectives, values, thoughts and capabilities of individuals (Norman, 1988) . Not all scholars agreed on Norman's conceptualisation of the term, and this gave birth to two schools of thought, one supporting Norman's definition and the other following that of Gibson. In this study, we adopt the definition of Norman (1988) and divide affordances into (1) technical affordances, the opportunities that the technology provides in general, in our case, social media platforms; (2) individual affordances, the opportunities given to the individual; and (3) contextual affordances, the opportunities provided by the context, in our case, the COVID-19 pandemic. With technical affordances, our particular focus is on those technical features that afford social media users to read and share news and information. The platforms provide affordances to explore content as well as an opportunity for individuals to promote themselves or their ideologies or simply have fun. Therefore, when looking at the individual affordances, we are concerned with personality factors (i.e. capabilities). Religious people might, for example, use social media to share religious news and posts. In contrast, people with low levels of self-regulation may bombard their social media network with content they have given little thought to. With regards to contextual affordances, the COVID-19 pandemic gave birth to a new situation with countless news emerging relating to the disease, policies, recommended health measures and various others. Accordingly, users were provided contextual affordances to share and comment on this news.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 61, "end": 74, "text": "Gibson (1966)", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 391, "end": 404, "text": "Gibson (1977)", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 487, "end": 500, "text": "Norman (1988)", "ref_id": "BIBREF64"}, {"start": 765, "end": 779, "text": "(Norman, 1988)", "ref_id": "BIBREF64"}, {"start": 963, "end": 970, "text": "Gibson.", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1013, "end": 1026, "text": "Norman (1988)", "ref_id": "BIBREF64"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "The affordance lens"}, {"text": "The two most significant benefits of using the affordance perspective for social media research: (1) it can provide new perspectives into how social media shapes its users' interactions; and (2) it can help understand how the users' inner needs can shape and regulate social media usage .

The evolutionary reaction to such situations is to back away and retreat to safer ground (Sweller, 2011) . As an example, imagine our ancestors living in a jungle. There is an obvious benefit from tending to go out and explore, such as finding food and resources. However, exploration also leads to unknown territory and situations where humans can no longer predict what will happen next, thus, making the situation potentially perilous. Accordingly, retreating to a familiar environment away from potential peril has been a beneficial thing to do. This evolutionary mechanism still affects human behaviour today and is at play, especially when acquiring new knowledge (Panksepp, 2013; Sweller, 2011) ; also referred to as the human comfort zone. Vygotsky theorises that learning happens right outside this zone, the so-called zone of proximal development (Shabani et al., 2010) . Using Vygotsky's zone of proximal development and CLT, information overload can be conceptualised to occur when individuals are overwhelmed with too much novel information or are taken too far away A.K.M.N. Islam, et al. Technological Forecasting & Social Change 159 (2020) 120201 from their comfort zone. Accordingly, information overload leads to impulses to step away from the new knowledge, back to the zone of proximal development (Shabani et al., 2010) . Consequently, in the case of information overload due to new knowledge and information coming from social media, SMF emerges (Bright et al., 2015) . Cognitive load is conceptualised to constitute an intrinsic, extraneous and germane load (Sweller, 2010) . The extraneous load has been investigated more often (Mutlu-Bayraktar et al., 2019) , and in the broader concept of human-computer interaction (HCI), refers to the environmental stimuli to which the human brain reacts. Intrinsic cognitive load, on the other hand, is the load resulting from processing this information and is affected by the individuals' psychological state of mind as well as their prior knowledge (Sweller, 2011) . Accordingly, well-structured information and prior expertise of the learner can both reduce intrinsic cognitive load (Hollender et al., 2010) . Germane load is a subconscious load that results from the working memory transferring information to long-term memory into so-called schemas. The three types of cognitive loads have been theorised to be linked so that reduced load of one kind releases cognitive capacity for the others (Paas et al., 2003) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 132, "end": 147, "text": "(Sweller, 2011)", "ref_id": "BIBREF81"}, {"start": 239, "end": 254, "text": "(Sweller, 2011)", "ref_id": "BIBREF81"}, {"start": 820, "end": 836, "text": "(Panksepp, 2013;", "ref_id": "BIBREF68"}, {"start": 837, "end": 851, "text": "Sweller, 2011)", "ref_id": "BIBREF81"}, {"start": 1007, "end": 1029, "text": "(Shabani et al., 2010)", "ref_id": "BIBREF77"}, {"start": 1230, "end": 1312, "text": "A.K.M.N.

As a theory of learning, CLT can also be used to understand how humans acquire knowledge through news articles. Accordingly, it is relevant in the ongoing research about fake news and misinformation, especially during times when humans need to absorb new information rapidly and change their behaviour, such as the COVID-19 pandemic (Laato et al., 2020a) . More specifically, we look at factors, which may affect the intrinsic cognitive load (Xiao and Mou, 2019) of social media users. Xiao and Mou (2019) in their literature review found the following intrinsic cognitive load factors to be meaningful in this context: fear of missing out (FoMO), privacy concerns, anxiety, and depression. They also revealed extrinsic cognitive load factors such as parental influence, cyberbullying, complexity, technology-related factors, and social overload to be relevant (Xiao and Mou, 2019) . In order to contribute to this body of literature, we propose that five key factors are yet to be taken into account with regards to intrinsic cognitive load factors (which are also aligned with the affordance perspective as discussed earlier) influencing SMF. These are: (1) self-promotion; (2) entertainment; (3) religiosity; (4) Deficient self-regulation (DS-R); and (5) exploration.

For example, people may share information (even private information) on social media to seek relatedness and approval from others (Nesi and Prinstein, 2015) . Using the affordance lens (Norman, 1988) , social media can be seen to provide social affordances. With these affordances, social media users actively create and maintain their self-image. Islam et al. (2019) conceptualised it as self-promotion and showed it to lead to both subjective vitality and addiction. The relationship between self-promotion and addiction indirectly suggests that in the long run, social media use driven by self-promotion increases fatigue (Dhir et al., 2018) . Furthermore, when people use social media for self-promotion purposes, they need to actively balance between what to share and what not to in order to maintain a positive image of themselves. This may be increasingly difficult under situations such as the COVID-19 pandemic where it is not easy to conceptualise which piece of information is relevant and trustworthy.

Perhaps surprisingly, focusing on others on social media has been found to have negative impacts on psychological wellbeing, whereas focusing on self-image has positive outcomes (Vogel and Rose, 2016) . The way social comparison on social media decreases wellbeing is that people tend to share only their best aspects online, hiding the negative, thus giving a falsified image to which to compare to (Vogel et al., 2014) . Thompson et al. (2019) showed status-seeking, which is closely related to self-promotion, to have a significant positive correlation with the intention to share news and information. Similar findings have also been shown in previous studies (Lee and Ma, 2012) . In the context of intra-organisational social media platforms, the primary motivation for sharing information is helping people (Vuori and Okkonen, 2012) . Prior research also suggests that social media users gain social capital through communicating and self-promoting themselves in social media (de Z\u00fa\u00f1iga et al., 2017) . By drawing on the affordance lens, Islam et al. (2019) discussed that social media provides the affordances to self-promote and gain social capital by creating an overly positivistic image of the self that appeals to other people. When the individuals' reputation is on the line, they are no longer under the influence of the online disinhibition effect (Suler, 2004) and are more mindful of what they are sharing. This may lead them to double-check information sources before sharing news articles. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the sharing of reliable information was being emphasised by the media and even social media platforms. Thus, we theorise that individuals driven by self-promotion are extra mindful not to share misinformation on COVID-19, as that may end up ridiculing them in the case the news they shared was fake.

The wish for fun or entertainment materialises, for example, by enjoying funny stories shared to the user's network and making fun of celebrities and political figures (Rieger and Klimmt, 2019) . While people wishing to inform and help others are concerned with the validity and reliability of the information they share (Vuori and Okkonen, 2012) , people wishing to have fun may not feel a similar obligation. Using the affordance lens (Norman, 1988) , we model social media as a multimodal venue, meaning it can be used for entertainment, but also as a place to share and read information. During the COVID-19 pandemic, a proportion of information sharing and social media activity was driven by a wish to have fun, often caused by humour as a coping mechanism in stressful situations (Chiodo et al., 2020; Lee and Ma, 2012) , or because humour can be a way to make sense of new information. A study observing COVID-19 related tweets on Twitter found roughly 6.1% to be written in a humorous tone (Kouzy et al., 2020) . While humour itself is a good thing, striving for entertainment as a goal is not concerned with the validity of the shared information as long as the content is funny. Accordingly, it is feasible to predict that using social media for entertainment leads to increased sharing of unverified information. Thus, we hypothesise the following. H3. Entertainment increases the sharing of unverified information. A.K.M.N. Islam, et al. Technological Forecasting & Social Change 159 (2020) 120201 Entertainment can be a way for people to blow off steam after a long workday, and as such, it can be characterised by emotional release, escapism and anxiety relief (Lee and Ma, 2012) . In particular, emotional release and anxiety relief act as ways to reduce stress and fatigue. By drawing on CLT (Sweller, 2011) , we argue that entertaining information may provide less cognitive load, as fun and entertainment may relax our mind, and thereby reduce our cognitive load. While social media use can be characterised by several drivers (Thompson et al., 2019) , the entertainment aspect of it can be regarded to reduce fatigue. During the COVID-19 pandemic, several tweets and social media posts containing humour emerged (Kouzy et al., 2020) . Some of the content may be regarded unsuitable and being in bad taste, such as the \"COVID-19 is a boomer-remover\" meme (Brooke and Jackson, 2020) . On the other hand, joking even with such grave topics can be regarded to be a form of coping with the ongoing situation, trying to find humour and lighter sides of it. Entertainment or comedy is often political but maybe also otherwise incorrect, possibly even as information. The information that a comedy often provides only serve the goal of provoking and making people think, and as such, is not concerned at all with being accurate. Because entertainment can thus be characterised as mindless escapism, anxiety relief and emotional release (Lee and Ma, 2012) , we propose the following hypothesis. H4.

As exploration and tertiary level information overload are regulated by the same primal SEEKING system (Sweller, 2011; Panksepp, 2013) , we conclude that exploration is associated with the ability to process information.

In turn, this may increase fatigue; (2) social media users are exposed to a large quantity of information, which can cause information overload, which in turn, leads to fatigue (Islam et al., 2018) .

Religion can serve, at all these levels, an individual, a social group, a broader community -and the community might be a religious community or a profane community using religion as an organising, constitutive or power structure -or a nation. Thus, religion can define identity in its diverse forms, for example as a cognitively expressed confession of the vital dogma of one's faith, or one belongs to a group of believers that share the same faith.

The complexity of religiosity has consequences to the concepts of information, knowledge and truth, and their verifiability, thus, it may be understood through the CLT (Sweller, 2011) . Religious people might be more sensitive to information that would refer to divine intervention; a thing that is hard to verify. At the same time, religious truth is very often unverified per se. The confirmation bias that may result from having strong religious viewpoints could cause an increase in sharing information that is regarded by the public as misinformation . Accordingly, religiosity could be linked to the sharing of unverified information. Thus, we hypothesise the following. H7. Religiosity increases the sharing of unverified information. Campbell (2012) emphasises the role of community for the expression of and living out personal faith. Instead of broadcasting or streaming religious events, called \"online religion\", she emphasises the transformation of religion by technology, i.e., \"religion online\". Social media provides affordances for religion online and offers a platform for synchronised and asynchronous communication. It enables religious people to interact even amidst pandemics where meeting in real life is discouraged. Religious people can form online communities on social media, where they primarily share the news that is written from the viewpoint of their religion. Being able to read the information that is built on a shared core belief system can reduce cognitive load and make reading news less stressful (Sweller, 2011) . This may decrease SMF. Additionally, religiosity is often associated with discipline and weekly (or daily) routines such as prayers. This may ward against overconsumption of social media, which has been identified as the primary cause for SMF (Dhir et al., 2018) . This may have been particularly relevant during COVID-19 where recommended social isolation measures caused people to spend an increasing amount of time at home and gave them more time to overload on social media content (Laato et al., 2020a) .

In this sense, our paper reinforces their findings by showing SMF led to unverified information sharing also during the COVID-19 infodemic. The impact of self-promotion has been suggested to have dual consequences (e.g. Islam et al., 2019) . This implies that self-promotion may lead to both positive consequences like psychological wellbeing and negative consequences like social media addiction. Our study adds to this body of research by showing that selfpromotion may also promote unverified information sharing on social media. It may be that entertainment, memes or sarcastic political news or information may be shared more often than others. In this regard, we show that false news on COVID-19 is partially propagated on social media due to the entertainment aspect of the news or information.

Therefore, our results contribute to this body of literature by showing that DS-R, entertainment and exploration are additional significant predictors of SMF. We note that while DS-R and exploration had positive effects, sharing entertaining news or information related to COVID-19 had negative effects on fatigue, meaning that it helped reduce SMF.
