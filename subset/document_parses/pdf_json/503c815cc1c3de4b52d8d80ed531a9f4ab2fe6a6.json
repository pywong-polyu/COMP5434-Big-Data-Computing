The National DPP allows for program delivery using four delivery modes: in person, online, distance learning, and combination. The objective of this study was to analyze cumulative enrollment in the National DPP by delivery mode. We included all participants who enrolled in CDC-recognized organizations delivering the lifestyle change program between January 1, 2012, and December 31, 2019, and whose data were submitted to CDC's Diabetes Prevention Recognition Program. During this time, the number of participants who enrolled was 455,954. Enrollment, by delivery mode, was 166,691 for in-person; 269,004 for online; 4,786 for distance-learning; and 15,473 for combination. In-person organizations enrolled the lowest proportion of men (19.4%) and the highest proportions of non-Hispanic Black/African American (16.1%) and older (65+ years) participants (28.2%). Online organizations enrolled the highest proportions of men (27.1%), younger (18-44 years) participants (41.5%), and non-Hispanic White participants (70.3%). Distance-learning organizations enrolled the lowest proportion of Hispanic/Latino participants (9.0%). Combination organizations enrolled the highest proportions of Hispanic/Latino participants (37.3%) and participants who had obesity (84.1%). Most in-person participants enrolled in organizations classified as community-centered entities (41.4%) or medical providers (31.2%). Online and distance-learning participants were primarily enrolled (93.3% and 70.2%, respectively) in organizations classified as forprofit businesses or insurers. Participants in combination programs were enrolled almost exclusively in organizations classified as medical providers (89%). The National DPP has reached nearly half a million participants since its inception in 2012, but continued expansion is critical to stem the tide of type 2 diabetes among the many Americans at high risk.",

The DPRP sets quality standards, collects data, and provides recognition to organizations that are delivering the National DPP lifestyle change program in accordance with the DPRP Standards and Operating Procedures (DPRP Standards) [9] . CDC-recognized organizations are required to use a CDC-approved curriculum, follow the duration and intensity requirements, and make biannual data submissions in order to maintain recognition. In order to advance to the status of being fully recognized, additional requirements involving attendance, weight loss, eligibility, and documentation must also be achieved. CDC has reported on various aspects of the National DPP's progress, including organization and participant characteristics and outcomes [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] . Initially, program delivery was required to be in-person, where participants are physically present with a trained lifestyle coach in a classroom or classroom-like setting. However, beginning in 2015, the DPRP began recognizing virtual delivery of the National DPP lifestyle change program via online or distance-learning delivery modes [9] . Online delivery was defined as participants logging into sessions via a computer, tablet, or smartphone, with coach interactions taking place outside of these self-paced sessions (i.e., asynchronous delivery); distance-learning delivery was defined as the coach being present in one location and participants simultaneously calling in or videoconferencing from another location (i.e., synchronous delivery). In order to increase accessibility, CDC also began recognizing program delivery consisting of a combination of any of the previously defined delivery modes [9] .",

We estimated the cumulative number of organizations per million residents by county as follows. First, using each organization's headquarters location zip code and unique identification code, we estimated the cumulative number of organizations per zip code, which we summed for each county to get the cumulative number of organizations per county [17] . We then divided by the total number of residents per county to get the cumulative number of organizations per million residents for each county.

Enrollment by delivery mode was 166,691 for in person; 269,004 for online; 4,786 for distance learning; and 15,473 for combination. The most common participant characteristics were female sex, age 45-64 years, non-Hispanic White race/ethnicity, and BMI in the obesity range; more than half of participants had a blood test in the prediabetes range or history of GDM (Table 1 ). Several differences in participant characteristics by delivery mode are worth noting. In-person organizations enrolled the lowest proportion of men (19.4%) and the highest proportions of non-Hispanic Black/African American (16.1%) and older (65+ years) participants (28.2%). Online organizations enrolled the highest proportions of men (27.1%), younger (18-44 years) participants (41.5%), and non-Hispanic White participants (70.3%) and the lowest proportion of participants who entered the program with a blood test in the prediabetes range (34.2%). Distance-learning organizations enrolled the lowest proportion of Hispanic/Latino participants (9.0%). Combination organizations enrolled the highest proportions of Hispanic/ Latino participants (37.3%), participants who had obesity (84.1%), and participants who entered the program with a blood test in the prediabetes range (86.8%). Figure 1 shows cumulative enrollment per 1,000,000 residents, by state, for each year since the National DPP was implemented in 2012. One key milestone for the National DPP was the introduction of virtual (online and distance learning) delivery in 2015, which resulted in expanded enrollment throughout the US. Another key milestone was the implementation of the Medicare Diabetes Prevention Program (MDPP) in 2018, which allowed for Medicare reimbursement to in-person organizations that were approved as MDPP suppliers. As of December 2019, the National DPP had reached all 50 states, along with Guam, Micronesia, Palau, Puerto Rico, and the US Virgin Islands. Cumulative enrollment has varied by state, with the highest per capita enrollment (>2,000 per 1 million) in California, Colorado, Delaware, Kansas, Kentucky, Maine, Minnesota, Montana, New Hampshire, Oregon, Vermont, and Washington.",

Organizations using in-person delivery enrolled a higher proportion of older (65+ years) participants, whereas online and distance-learning organizations enrolled a higher proportion of younger participants (18-44 years), which may be due to their availability through workplace settings. Making virtual programs more accessible and attractive to older participants may help those who face transportation challenges or other barriers to in-person gatherings. Although some older participants may be reluctant to adopt new technologies, virtual delivery approaches have shown promise with this age group [24] . Online organizations enrolled a somewhat higher proportion of men than in-person organizations and thus may be an important avenue for increasing the relatively low proportion of men who enroll in the National DPP lifestyle change program [13] . The organizations with no in-person component (i.e., online and distance learning) enrolled lower proportions of participants who were Hispanic/Latino or non-White, suggesting that in order to reduce health disparities, these delivery modes need to be made more accessible and appealing to minority racial and ethnic groups [25] . Overall, however, we found that the racial/ethnic distributions of enrollees (Table 1) , although outreach could be improved for some racial/ethnic groups. Encouragingly, the National DPP lifestyle change program has now been delivered by CDC-recognized organizations in all 50 US states, as well as in multiple U.S. territories and freely associated states. However, the differences in enrollment by state are substantial, and many counties still do not have CDC-recognized organizations. Some of these differences are mitigated by the burgeoning availability of virtual delivery; however, most online and distancelearning enrollment has been through organizations that do not have publicly available offerings; i.e., they are only available through employers or insurance plans. Therefore, program expansion to underserved rural counties and urban centers must be a future priority.",

Anecdotally, organizations report various reasons for voluntarily withdrawing from the DPRP. The most common reasons are a change in organizational priorities, frequent turnover in staffing, and lack of funding to sustain delivery of the program. Other research suggests the level of third-party reimbursement rates is an important driver of whether or not organizations offer the program [27] . In particular, in early 7 Journal of Diabetes Research 2018, there was a surge in new in-person organizations joining the DPRP because the Medicare benefit was being implemented. We observed that some of these organizations dropped out in 2019 when they were unable to enroll enough participants to start a cohort and submit data.

These limitations are by design; the DPRP seeks to minimize the data collection burden to organizations. As a result, we had only a small number of participant demographic characteristics and did not have information such as participant income, employment status, or insurance status. Furthermore, until the implementation of the 2015 DPRP Standards, the DPRP did not collect information on participant state of residence. Thus, it is possible that some participants resided in states or counties that were different from where their organization was located. Although this location difference might be expected for virtual organizations, it could also have occurred for in-person organizations, not only because some participants might travel across boundaries to attend sessions but also because many organizations have multiple cohorts whose locations are not required to be reported to the DPRP. As a result, the number of organizations per million residents might have been underestimated or overestimated for some counties. In addition, we did not have any data on who was offered or referred to the program, so differences in enrollee characteristics by delivery mode could have been caused by a number of factors, including personal choice, payer source (e.g., private insurance vs. Medicaid), differences in where the delivery modes were offered (e.g., workplace vs. retirement centers), or other factors. Lastly, we did not know why most participants chose to enroll; a question about reasons for enrollment was added to the 2018 DPRP standards, but for many participants, responses were missing. A more complete picture of drivers of enrollment, therefore, will likely require research studies that collect additional information to supplement the information submitted to the DPRP.",
