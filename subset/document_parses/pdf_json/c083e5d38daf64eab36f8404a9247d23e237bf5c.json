            "text": "Background: Occupational musculoskeletal injuries are prevalent in healthcare workers and are reported to be profession-specific. There is, however, a paucity of information around the injuries sustained from working as a podiatrist. This paper looks at the incidence of injury from working as a podiatrist, the aggravating factors to sustain these injuries and whether the changes in workload due to the COVID-19 pandemic altered the incidence. Methods: A modified work based musculoskeletal injury questionnaire was distributed in the UK via podiatry led social media platforms. Open and Closed questions explored the demographics of the sample, perceived injury 12 months prior to the COVID-19 pandemic and then 6 months into the lockdown. Pre and post COVID-19 data were analysed for differences and thematic analysis was included to categorise reported experiences. Results: 148 podiatrists representing 3 % of HCPC registered practitioners responded to the questionnaire. Employment status altered as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic with a 13 % reduction in those working full time. Environments also changed with domiciliary and telehealth significantly increasing (p > 0.00) and non-clinical roles being extended (p > 0.002). Pain frequency and intensity significantly (p > 0.04) increased as a result of the pandemic with shoulder pain being most frequent before lockdown altering to the neck during the lockdown. Two main themes were identified that were attributed to the causes of pain including physical demands and working in awkward spaces. Conclusions: Work-related musculoskeletal pain in podiatrists is common with the shoulder and neck being the most frequently affected. Changes in work practices due to the restrictions enforced from the COVID-19 pandemic increased the frequency and intensity of pain mostly associated with increased domiciliary and telehealth working environments.",

This leads to increased use of healthcare services, loss of workdays and reduced productivity [3] . Anatomical regions injured appear to be specific to the profession with reports of hand pain in Physiotherapist and shoulder problems in Sonographers [4, 5] . When exploring the occupational health risks of Podiatry there is an indication that 76 % of Podiatrists suffer from MSK injury [6] , with the most frequently affected area being the lower back [7, 8] and the hand being observed due to instrument use [9] . There is however a lack of understanding of how these problems impact practice and what changes podiatrists make to address work-based MSK pain. Exploring this area further will help to inform policy and current guidelines for practice.",

Accessing the foot at the appropriate height and angle can stretch clinicians into positions that increase the load on joints and incur repetitive movements. In a clinical setting, the working position can be improved with the use of appropriate hardware such as the patient couch, clinician chair and operating trolley. However, these are not an option on a domiciliary basis, which has been shown to challenge posture with excessive flexion of the neck and a slumped position [8] . During domiciliary treatment podiatrists are often in cramped, awkward positions on the floor or at the end of a bed. There can be a little variation of posture, which can result in specific MSK demands on the body [6] .",

Frequencies of care provision changed as continuation of service was critical whilst limiting patient contact. Telehealth became commonplace [11, 12] and strict guidance on suitable patient contact was made [13] . These changes impacted working practices and altered the way that Podiatry was being used as a service and delivered [14] , as well as many podiatrists being redeployed into non podiatry roles. The long-term impact of these changes has yet to be established as the pandemic continues. This change in practice gave an opportunity to investigate MSK workrelated injuries sustained from working as a podiatrist prior to and during a 6 month period of the COVID-19 pandemic, March 2020.",

These environments include ergonomic hardware such as the patient couch, clinician chair and operating trolley which allow for adjustments in height and position. Having a flexible working environment is strongly recommended to dentists who most commonly retire due to work associated MSK problems [18] . Restricting this environment during the 6-month COVID-19 pandemic with work altering to domiciliary and telehealth could have been attributed to the increase in pain as demands on the body alter. The posture of podiatrists is poor, especially when providing domiciliary care as the treated foot is often placed on the podiatrist's knee causing excessive flexion of the neck [8] . This posture is also associated with increased trapezius muscle activity and is associated with tasks such as computer work [4] , with forward flexion of the neck being linked to back problems [19] . Additionally, the change from community health clinics to domiciliary work, either in the patients own home, care home or with assisted living, reduces the number of contacts made per day increasing the waiting times for patients and reducing the economic efficiency of the service.",

Although these changes were not significantly different, they are both associated with forward flexion of the neck seen in podiatry practice. Interestingly, the most common ergonomic challenge reported in dentists was prolonged maintenance of position and forward flexion of the neck or trunk, with upper arm elevation being an additional high MSK risk for shoulder pain. It was discovered that an increment of just 1 % upper arm elevation over the working day could be linked to tendinitis and shoulder pain [2] . Although working on different regions of the body, dentists adopt a similar position to podiatrists when completing their work. Therefore considerable attention should be paid to arm and neck position when treating podiatry patients to avoid work related neck and shoulder pain. A specific work based ergonomic assessment of podiatrists posture during intervention is recommended particularly when completing domiciliary care. Although it is not the purpose of this work to review the HSE guidance [20] on working practices for podiatry in a domiciliary setting, reporting the incidence of MSK problems in practice highlights that despite following rules and regulations still results in worked based injury. Advancing training in the ergonomics of practising safely would assist podiatrists in completing their role, as seen in other healthcare professions [21] .",

It is well established that long periods of sitting can be detrimental to MSK health and short periods of seated computer work are recommended [22] . Additionally, altered inactivity was highlighted as an issue, as walking around a clinic and attending to patients were replaced with days sat at a desk. Although it is deemed mandatory to have a DSE screen assessment, it is clear from this work that this is not often adhered to, leaving podiatrists at risk. This could have been as there was a rapid change in practice leading to a lapse in protocol. Prevention of work related injuries in nursing are effective with an exercise program where conditioning workers to the tasks involved in the role reduced the incidence of pain [23] . This type of prevention should be included in conditioning podiatrists with neck and shoulder strengthening and exercise programmes being implemented which could reduce the injuries sustained from practising.",

To date, there is no research to support the use of specialist foot stools and operating chairs to use in podiatry domiciliary work that would reduce work related pain. Guidance on how podiatry can be safely implemented in a patients home is required to give support to those working in this environment.
