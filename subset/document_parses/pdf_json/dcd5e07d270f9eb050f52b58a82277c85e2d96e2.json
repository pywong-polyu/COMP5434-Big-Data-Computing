SARS-CoV-2 viral entry depends on an interaction between the receptor binding domain of the trimeric viral Spike protein (Spike-RBD) and the dimeric human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor. While it is clear that strategies to block the Spike/ACE2 interaction are promising as anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapeutics, our current understanding is insufficient for the rational design of maximally effective therapeutic molecules. Here, we investigated the mechanism of Spike/ACE2 interaction by characterizing the binding affinity and kinetics of different multimeric forms of recombinant ACE2 and Spike-RBD domain. We also engineered ACE2 into a split Nanoluciferase-based reporter system to probe the conformational landscape of Spike-RBDs in the context of the Spike trimer. Interestingly, a dimeric form of ACE2, but not monomeric ACE2, binds with high affinity to Spike and blocks viral entry in pseudotyped virus and live SARS-CoV-2 virus neutralization assays. We show that dimeric ACE2 interacts with an RBD on Spike with limited intra-Spike avidity, which nonetheless contributes to the affinity of this interaction.",

The number of people suffering from the associated disease continues to rise, increasing the need for effective therapeutic interventions. SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 Spike proteins are highly homologous (~76% sequence identity). Similar to SARS-CoV-1, the interaction between the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein and the angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 (ACE2) on human cells is critical for viral entry into host cells (Gralinski & Menachery, 2020; Tai et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2020) . SARS-CoV-2 Spike is an obligate trimer, while ACE2 presents as a dimer on the cell surface (Chen, Liu, & Guo, 2020) . Several highresolution structures of SARS-CoV-2 Spike receptor binding domain (Spike-RBD) bound to ACE2 have been published (Lan et al., 2020; Yan et al., 2020) . However, as of this writing, structures of SARS-CoV-2 Spike trimer in complex with either the dimeric or monomeric form of ACE2 have not been reported, resulting in an incomplete understanding of the nature of this interaction.",

The results reveal that while both the ACE2 monomer and ACE2-Fc dimer can bind the isolated Spike-RBD, only the ACE2-Fc dimer can bind tightly to the trimeric Spike ectodomain (FL-Spike). Interestingly, the affinity of the ACE2-Fc dimer is much higher to the RBD-Fc dimer than to FL-Spike, suggesting that although intramolecular avidity plays a role in both interactions, its effect is compromised in the context of FL-Spike. Consistent with this, we find that ACE2 associates more slowly to FL-Spike, which indicates that the RBDs in FL-Spike protein are not readily accessible to ACE2. To further probe the conformational landscape of the RBDs in FL-Spike, we engineered ACE2-Fc as split-Nanoluciferase (NanoLuc) reporters. We found that a proportion of FL-Spike can interact with multiple ACE2-Fc molecules simultaneously, indicating that more than one RBD domain in a Spike trimer can adopt an \"up\" conformation. Using pseudotyped and SARS-CoV-2 virus neutralization assays, we further show that ACE2-Fc dimer is much more potent at neutralizing virus than ACE2 monomer. These findings extend our biochemical insight into how a Spike trimer binds to an ACE2 dimer, and have important implications for how multimeric therapeutic molecules, such as dimeric ACE2 or antibody-based biologics, can effectively target SARS-CoV-2.",

Surprisingly, we found that the binding interaction between ACE2 monomer and FL-Spike is very weak and could not be measured accurately ( Figure 2C ). By contrast, the ACE2-Fc interacts with FL-Spike with a KD of 5.9 nM, similar to the affinity for the isolated Spike-RBD-monomer ( Figure 2F ). This suggests that the presence of two ACE2 molecules in close proximity in ACE2-Fc is essential for a productive interaction with FL-Spike, and that a single ACE2 monomer is not sufficient to bind an RBD on FL-Spike. However, the affinity between FL-Spike/ACE2-Fc interaction was substantially less than Spike-RBD-Fc/ACE2-Fc interaction (KD < 10 -12 M, Figure 2E ), suggesting that the high-avidity two-on-two interaction is compromised in the context of FL-Spike. This could be due to geometric/steric constraints or the unique conformations of the RBDs in the FL-Spike context. When FL-Spike is loaded to a much higher density on the BLI sensor (load to 2.0 nm) and probed with ACE2-Fc, we see that avidity can be recovered (Supplementary Figure S3A ). This indicates that if Spike is presented at high density, the ACE2-Fc arms can engage two RBDs if neighboring Spike trimers are close enough.",

This is further shown in the split-NanoLuc reporter experiments where ACE2 domains from two separate ACE2-Fc split-reporters can simultaneously bind a Spike trimer to generate an active luciferase (Figure 3 ).

It is possible that ACE2-Fc could bridge two Spike molecules on the viral surface and bind with increased avidity, similar to what we observed in the high-density loading BLI experiment (Supplementary Figure 3A) . Previous structural studies of SARS-CoV-1 shows the Spike proteins are densely distributed (Lin et al., 2004) , with ~100 Spike molecules displayed on a viral particle with a diameter of ~100 nm (Beniac, Andonov, Grudeski, & Booth, 2006; Neuman et al., 2006) . Using values from these studies, we estimate an inter-Spike distance of ~180 \u00c5. The structure of the native ACE2 dimer (PDB: 6M17) shows that the two ACE2 arms (~80 \u00c5 apart) would not be able to span this predicted inter-Spike distance. An ACE2 monomer fused Fc with flexible linker (ACE2-Fc) may be sufficient to only bridge two Spikes that are <150 \u00c5 apart. Structural studies of IgGs have shown the antigen binding sites in the Fab arms on a flexible-hinge region of an Fc to be roughly ~117-134 \u00c5 apart (Sosnick et al. 1992 ).",

The relative population of these RBD conformers and whether they exist in an ACE2-unbound state or emerge only upon ACE2 binding remains unknown ( Figure   6F ). Previous studies have suggested that ACE2 binding could lead to conformational change in SARS-CoV-1 or 2 Spike (Song et al., 2018; Yuan et al., 2020) . Molecular dynamic simulation of SARS-CoV-2 Spike bound to ACE2 found that there is significant flexibility in the RBD conformation (Peng et al., 2020) , and an EM study of SARS-CoV-1 Spike reported that the distribution of the RBD conformers was very different in the ACE2-bound structure compared to the unbound structure (Kirchdoerfer et al., 2018) . In accordance with these studies, our results support the model that ACE2 binding induces a conformational change in Spike and enables two or more RBDs to be in the \"up\" conformation ( Figure 6F ). This complex and dynamic nature of the Spike/ACE2 interaction is likely to play a key role in the biology of SARS-CoV-2 infection.",

Spike variants were loaded onto sensors until binding was between 0.4-0.6 nm. ACE2 monomer or ACE2-Fc were used as analytes in solution, with concentrations ranging from 100 nM to 3.125 nM. Although ACE2 monomer bound Spike-RBD-monomer and Spike-RBD-Fc at KD of 18.5 and 12.0 nM, respectively, it did not bind FL-Spike strongly (A-C). In contrast, the ACE2-Fc dimer bound to these forms with affinities of 5.5 nM, <1 pM, and 5.9 nM (D-F). Although ACE2-Fc can bind Spike-RBD-Fc with strong intramolecular avidity, this 2-on-2 interaction is not present in the context of FL-Spike, indicating that only one arm of ACE2-Fc can engage an RBD in FL-Spike. The decreased kon and koff of ACE2-Fc in the context of FL-Spike (F) compared to Spike-RBDmonomer (D) indicates that conformational changes of the RBD in the context of the Spike trimer are important in the interaction of ACE2-Fc to FL-Spike. The N-terminal ACE2 NanoBiT system is able to detect Spike-RBD-Fc bound magnetic beads with better sensitivity than the C-terminal fusions (Supplementary Figure S4) . (F) Cartoon depiction of the N-terminal ACE2 NanoBiT sensor system to detect FL-Spike in solution. (G) The N-terminal ACE2 NanoBiT system is able to detect FL-Spike in solution, indicating that more than one RBD in a FL-Spike trimer can be in the \"up\" conformation for two ACE2-Fc molecules to bind and reconstitute the split enzyme. For all assays, the luminescence signal is normalized to a no-bead control and the average and standard deviation is plotted (N=3). The majority of FL-Spike proteins are in the \"closed\" or partially \"closed\" conformation and \"opening up\" of RBD on Spike is necessary for ACE2 binding. (B) Monomeric ACE2 binds poorly to trimeric Spike, (C) ACE2-Fc binds much stronger to Spike than monomer, indicating that rebinding and intra-Spike avidity contribute significantly to the high-affinity nature of this interaction. (D) Dimeric ACE2-Fc does not interact with FL-Spike with a full two-on-two intramolecular avidity. (E) More than one RBD can be in the \"up\" conformation, enabling the engagement of separate ACE2 molecules. For (B-E), only the \"two-up\" conformation is shown but other RBD conformations are also possible. (F) A proposed model where ACE2 binding may induce a conformational change in Spike, resulting in \"two-up\" or \"three-up\" RBD conformations. (H) Dimeric molecules such as ACE2-Fc or IgG will be more potent than a monomeric inhibitor for neutralizing SARS-CoV-2 virus. For all panels, RBD in the \"open\" conformation is colored in green and RBD in the \"closed\" formation colored in grey. ",

Luciferase activity in cell lysates were determined at 48 hours post infection and normalized to no treatment control. (B) The half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) was obtained for the two ACE-Fc treatment by fitting the normalized data to a 4-parameter nonlinear regression. The average IC50 between two two biological replicates of ACE2-Fc treatment was 0.98 \u00b5g/ml (4.8 nM). ACE2-Fc neutralizes SARS-CoV-2 live virus more potently than ACE2 monomer. SARS-CoV-2 live virus pre-incubated with 100 nM of ACE2-Fc or ACE2 monomer was used to infect VeroE6 cells. 16 hours post infection, cells were lysed and intercellular RNA was isolated and converted to cDNA. Viral entry and cellular transcription of viral genes was measured by qPCR. Relative copy number of viral N or E gene transcript for each treatment arm was determined using either (A) host gene GUSB (hGUSB) or (B) host gene ACTB (hACTB) as the reference control.
