Many countries implemented unprecedented measures to control SARS-CoV-2. National lockdowns, physical distancing, quarantine, and travel restrictions were widely implemented. For many countries these measures were successful in controlling the initial wave of the epidemic. However, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID- 19) , can range from asymptomatic infection to severe pneumonia and death [1] [2] [3] [4] . The possibility of transmission occurring within this wide presentation range has made sustained control of the disease difficult [5] . Indeed, several early instances of countries easing restrictions and reopening economies and schools have resulted in epidemic recrudescence [6] [7] [8] .",

Persons with asymptomatic COVID-19 infection present a unique challenge as they lack characteristics that might indicate they are infected. Virological studies [9, 10] indicate asymptomatic persons shed similar quantities of virus to symptomatic persons and observational studies have found that younger patients are less likely to present with severe forms of the disease [11, 12] . However, the proportion of infections that are asymptomatic and their infectiousness is still uncertain. Therefore, improving our understanding of the role of persons with asymptomatic COVID-19 infection in the epidemic will be crucial to informing public health strategies.",

Disagreements were resolved by consensus with two other reviewers (FF and JRC). If multiple studies reported on the same or overlapping cohorts of participants, information was extracted from each individual study to complement the available information. We defined asymptomatic COVID-19 positive persons as those who did not present any symptoms (or any new symptoms, if pre-existing chronic conditions) at the time of SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis. Pre-symptomatic COVID-19 positive persons were those who were asymptomatic at the time of initial SARS-CoV-2 testing but developed symptoms during study follow-up. Two independent reviewers (MYL, SPA) assessed the quality of each study; any disagreements were resolved by consensus with a third reviewer (JRC). The quality of included studies was evaluated using adapted criteria from the Newcastle-Ottawa scale for cohort studies, and from the Joanna Briggs Institute Prevalence Critical Appraisal Tool for cross-sectional [14, 15] . The quality of included studies was assessed in the domains of selection bias, reporting bias and detection bias (depending on follow-up and outcome measures). We developed our own quality assessment tool for case series exclusively reporting on asymptomatic transmission as we could not identify a validated tool. Our quality assessment tool assessed the domains of reporting bias, detection bias (for contact identification and diagnosis), and misclassification bias (for direction of transmission from the index patient). Signalling questions and domains were selected based on epidemiological knowledge. All studies were classified as low, moderate, or high quality based on presence of bias in each, following grading scales developed a priori (see S2 File for detail on quality assessment tools and grading scales).",

Crude proportions of asymptomatic infection at COVID-19 initial testing, and of COVID-19 infection that remained asymptomatic throughout follow-up, were calculated using n/N based on data availability within each study.",

All meta-analyses were performed with package meta and metaprop function (version 4.12.0) in R (version 3.6.0). For each primary outcome measure, we logit transformed individual study outcomes and applied random-effects meta-analysis using generalized linear mixed models for each as well as for the overall proportion; pooled and individual study proportions were then back-transformed. For all meta-analyses, heterogeneity was quantified using the I 2 statistic. In order to determine the proportion of truly asymptomatic individuals (i.e. those who do not develop symptoms at any time during follow up) the total number of COVID-19 infected persons that remain asymptomatic through follow up was used as numerator, and the total number of COVID-19 infections was used as denominator. For studies on transmission, metaanalysis was not performed. For individual transmission studies, we calculated the proportion of contacts traced and tested who were positive for COVID-19 and corresponding exact confidence intervals using the Clopper-Pearson method [16] and report the secondary attack rate overall.",

While it is understandable that in the first months of the pandemic any case-series are of great interest, there is a limited value to the evidence this type of research presents. In order to provide a higher level of evidence, future COVID-19 research should focus on using cohort study designs that include: systematic screening, clear reporting of participant selection criteria, ascertainment of time of exposure, time from exposure to diagnosis, adequate follow-up time after diagnosis, assessment of time to symptom onset, and time to RT-PCR negativity. Additionally, new phone applications for contact tracing coupled with systematic surveillance surveys could work to identify persons while they are asymptomatic and trace their close contacts to provide more evidence on their role in transmission.",

It is likely that transmission from index patients who remained asymptomatic throughout infection may not be detected or reported due the nature of the asymptomatic infection. Therefore, secondary attack rates estimated from these studies may not be truly representative of real-world attack rates, but when combined with other studies on viral shedding [92, 93] , provide evidence that asymptomatic persons can readily transmit SARS-CoV-2. In addition, studies have identified high viral loads in asymptomatic persons for up to 9 days, and in pre-symptomatic persons for up to 6 days prior to symptoms [9, 10] . These viral loads are like those found in symptomatic persons [9, 10, 94, 95] . Together, these findings suggest that exclusively carrying out symptombased testing will not be sufficient to eliminate transmission and will likely miss a large proportion of SARS-CoV-2 infections.",

This testing would be facilitated by development and distribution of inexpensive, point of care tests for COVID-19. In symptomatic persons diagnosed with COVID-19, contact tracing should be extended to several days prior to symptom onset (i.e., up to 6 days based on viral shedding) [9, 58] to ensure persons exposed to index patients while they were asymptomatic are identified. Finally, current non-pharmaceutical measures, such as frequent handwashing, physical distancing, and use of facemasks should be continued as they limit exposure to persons who are infected but asymptomatic.",

We excluded studies assessed to be of low quality, as these did not include information on the population tested, methods for ascertaining the presence of symptoms or definition of asymptomatic, which we deemed to be important for reducing bias.

Studies also differed in terms of when they were conducted in relation to epidemic stage; however, by only including studies with systematic screening, this should overcome potential biases. We could not identify high-quality studies in children and so this important population was not included in this review. Another important limitation is the fact that no tools were identified to evaluate the quality of transmission studies, and although we created a tool for this purpose, it is not validated. It is possible there is publication bias towards case-series documenting transmission from asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic individuals, given that studies in which transmission from asymptomatic individuals was not documented are not available. This may cause us to overestimate the true secondary attack rate from these types of infections. We attempted to mitigate this risk by applying strict criteria for inclusion, which necessitated clear reporting of the contact investigation, number of contacts traced, number of contacts tested, and time of transmission.",
