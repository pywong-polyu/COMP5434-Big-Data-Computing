An unusual feature that is sometimes seen in patients diagnosed with COVID-19 is the appearance of bradycardia, i.e., slow heart rate, or heart rate not increasing as expected with body temperature (Ikeuchi et al., 2020; Capoferri et al., 2021; Douedi et al., 2021; Oliva et al., 2021) . Amaratunga et al. (2020) found bradycardia in a study of 4 patients with confirmed COVID-19, with minimum pulse rates in the range 42-49 beats per minute. Amir et al. (2021) reported 6 cases of bradycardia among patients diagnosed with COVID-19, with 4 patients developing complete atrioventricular block. Elikowski et al. (2021) presented clinical data of 19 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 who exhibited sinus bradycardia, in some cases showing heart rates as low as 32 bpm during daily hours. Srinivasan et al. (2021) discussed 6 cases of patients who were diagnosed with COVID-19 and admitted with normal sinus rhythm, and who subsequently developed sinus bradycardia with daytime heart rates ranging from 35-48 bpm. In a study of 97 patients with a non-severe presentation of COVID-19, Zhou et al. (2021) found significant sinus bradycardia (below 50 bpm) in 7.2% of cases.",

            "text": "In addition to bradycardia, COVID-19 is known to cause a number of other cardiac anomalies. In a study of 140 individuals diagnosed with COVID-19 and 281 individuals diagnosed with influenza, Lampert et al. (2021) found that diminished QRS amplitude was dynamic during the course of illness, and was an independent predictor of mortality with both COVID-19 and influenza, but was more prevalent in the case of COVID-19. Cardiac injury, heart failure, and arrhythmias have been recorded in patients diagnosed with COVID-19 (Linschoten et al., 2020; Shi et al., 2020; Coromilas et al., 2021; Sahranavard et al., 2021) . Guo et al. (2020) reported ventricular tachycardia (VT) or ventricular fibrillation (VF) in 11 out of 187 patients with confirmed COVID-19 and found that elevated levels of troponin T were correlated with VT/VF. Inflammatory damage due to cytokines has been suggested as a possible explanation for cardiac involvement with COVID-19 (Bhatla et al., 2020; Dherange et al., 2020; Peigh et al., 2020; Elikowski et al., 2021) . In a retrospective analysis of 3,970 patients admitted with COVID-19 and 1,420 patients admitted with influenza, Musikantow et al. (2021) found similar incidences of atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter with COVID-19 (10%) and influenza (12%). The presence of atrial fibrillation was associated with increased mortality in both COVID-19 and influenza (Musikantow et al., 2021) . New-onset atrial fibrillation was found to be influenced most by markers of inflammation such as Interleukin 6 and C-reactive protein (Musikantow et al., 2021) . Pardo Sanz et al. (2021) found that new-onset atrial fibrillation is associated with worse outcomes than in patients with existing atrial fibrillation.",

Participants provided information on whether they were diagnosed with COVID-19 or flu, as well as the test date, symptoms, and the start date of symptoms. Participants could optionally provide information about their age, sex, body mass index, and information on underlying conditions. Individuals diagnosed with COVID-19 also indicated the severity of the disease which could be 1) severe, indicating that they required hospitalization, 2) mild, indicating that they recovered at home, or 3) asymptomatic. The survey and associated marketing and recruitment materials were approved by an Institutional Review Board (Advarra). The participants provided electronic informed consent for their data to be used for research. In this study, we consider data from Fitbit users who reported testing positive for COVID-19 in the date range March 1-31 Dec 2020, as well as users who reported testing positive for flu in the date range January 1-31 Dec 2020. There were 11,918 participants who tested positive for COVID-19 (mean age = 40.8 years, std. dev. = 12.4 years, 79.0% female) in our dataset, and 865 participants who tested positive for flu (mean age = 41.7 years, std. dev. = 13.3 years, 78.2% female). We randomly selected 1,000 users who did not report a positive test for either COVID-19 or flu as a control group (mean age = 45.3 years, std. dev. = 13.9 years, 71.6% female). Table 1 shows the prevalence of symptoms (self reported) for COVID-19 and flu, for male and female participants (for COVID-19, we also separate by disease severity). Some symptoms such as fatigue, headache, and body ache are common for both COVID-19 and flu. By contrast, a decrease in taste and/or smell is more likely in the case of COVID-19 (72.6% female, 59.8% male) compared to flu (21.2% female, 11.6% male). Fever is more common with flu (81.3% female, 76.8% male) compared to COVID-19 (51.4% female, 58% male). Figure 1 shows the distribution of positive cases for flu and COVID-19, where the horizontal axis is the test date, and only positive cases are shown.

Heart Rate Variability is usually a good thing (with the exception of heart arrhythmias) since a healthy heart does not beat like a metronome. Heart Rate Variability allows the cardiovascular system to adjust to physical and psychological challenges to homeostasis (Shaffer and Ginsberg, 2017) . Here, we consider the root mean square of the successive differences (RMSSD) between heart beats as the HRV metric of importance. The RMSSD is computed in 5 min windows between the hours of midnight and 7 a.m. The median of the measurements is then reported. Fitbit does not measure interbeat intervals when movement is detected, and therefore Fitbit devices primarily measure HRV during sleep. Further details of how Fitbit devices compute RMSSD have been described in Natarajan et al. (2020a) . For the respiratory rate calculation, we first compute the power spectral density of interbeat intervals in 5 min windows between the hours of midnight and 7 a.m. The measurements are then averaged, and the respiratory rate is estimated from the averaged power spectral density. We subtract out the seasonality of the RMSSD and respiratory rate in a similar manner to the RHR, with the addition of a median filter (with a period of 7 days). The median filter is necessary because the RMSSD and respiratory rate waveforms are not smoothed by a Kalman filter, and are hence noisier than the RHR. The effect of illness on the RMSSD and respiratory rate may be estimated as:",

The first relative tachycardia peak amplitude (A t1 ) is larger for flu compared to mild or asymptomatic COVID-19, while the second tachycardia peak is similar in the cases of flu and asymptomatic COVID-19.

We do a similar comparison with the data in the tachycardia window. We compute the fraction of participants with \u0394RHR \u2265 x computed from the tachycardia window, and compare with the fraction computed from data in the healthy window. Figure 5 shows this comparison. The curve plotted in red in Figure 5A shows the fraction of individuals in the time window D +7 \u2212 D +21 with \u0394RHR \u2264 x plotted along the horizontal axis. This should be compared with the curve plotted in green which is an estimate of how likely it is that such a low \u0394RHR may occur due to random chance. Figure 5B shows a similar comparison, but for \u0394RHR \u2265 x, and considering the tachycardia window. Interestingly, there is a correlation between the peak value of \u0394RHR measured during symptom onset (we use a 15 days window from D \u22125 to D +9 ) and the peak and minimum values of \u0394RHR measured in the second relative tachycardia window (D +22 to D +36 ) and the relative bradycardia window (D +7 to D +21 ). Figure 6 shows this correlation. The horizontal axis is \u0394RHR during symptom onset, while the vertical axis shows \u0394RHR during either the second tachycardia phase (red) or the bradycardia phase (blue) (the points are the mean values, while the shaded contours show the one standard deviation range). We see that \u0394RHR tachy measured in the second relative tachycardia phase is positively correlated with \u0394RHR symptom , the peak value observed at symptom onset. Similarly, \u0394RHR brady , the minimum value observed during the relative bradycardia phase is positively correlated with \u0394RHR symptom . This means that a low \u0394RHR at symptom onset is indicative of a decreased RHR in the relative bradycardia phase. An approximate estimate of \u0394RHR tachy and \u0394RHR brady may be obtained by the following linear relations (with all measurements in bpm):",

The relative bradycardia phase is seen to be accompanied by elevated heart rate variability, while the second relative tachycardia phase is associated with reduced heart rate variability. The variation is also of greater amplitude with the RMSSD compared to the RHR. The fractional change in the respiratory rate, on the other hand, does not show a similar time evolution.

Long COVID or post COVID thus refers to the time between microbiological recovery and clinical recovery (Raveendran et al., 2021) . Long COVID might be considered post-acute COVID if symptoms persist beyond 3 weeks but less than 12 weeks, and chronic COVID when symptoms exist beyond 12 weeks (Greenhalgh et al., 2020) . It is therefore not surprising that physiological biomarkers are affected for several months following a COVID-19 diagnosis. Wearable devices can play an important role in monitoring long COVID by measuring biomarkers indicative of illness. Radin et al. (2021) used data from Fitbit devices to show that the RHR is affected for 2-3 months following symptom onset. In this article, we confirmed the findings of Radin et al. (2021) using a large dataset of 7,200 COVID-19 positive and 463 flu positive individuals. Consistent with the findings of Radin et al. (2021) , we find that the RHR can be modified for up to 3 months following symptom onset. Interestingly, this phenomenon is also seen in cases of flu. Both COVID-19 and flu cases show 3 distinct phases:",

The peak value A t1 is higher in males compared to females, for COVID-19 (p \u2212 value < 0.0001) and flu (p \u2212 value = 0.0118). \u2022 Following this peak, the RHR decreases, and reaches a local minimum value A b at a time T b days after symptom onset. If A b < 0, we refer to this phase as relative bradycardia, and define a full width at half minimum W b . The condition A b < 0 is satisfied for females (averaged over all ages), for COVID-19 (p < 0.0001), and for flu (p = 0.042). The condition A b < 0 is not statistically significant for males (averaged over all ages), for either COVID-19 or flu. \u2022 Following the minimum, the RHR increases, reaching a second local maximum A t2 at a time T t2 days from symptom onset, with a full width at half maximum W t2 . The peak value A t2 is higher in males compared to females, for COVID-19 (p < 0.0001) and flu (p = 0.0667). Figure 3 shows the fractional change in RHR \u03be for flu and COVID-19, along with the control. Subtracting the variation for the control group allows us to calculate the effect due to illness \u0394\u03be. Figure 4 shows \u0394\u03be for male and female participants for different cases of COVID-19 severity, and for flu. Since these phases occur with both COVID-19 and flu, they are not novel to COVID-19. They can however, be more prominent in the case of COVID-19. It should be noted that flu has also been associated with cardiovascular disease (Nguyen et al., 2016) . It is also known that the autonomic nervous system plays a key role in sensing and responding to infection, with pathogens activating vagal signaling causing bradyarrhythmias (Fairchild et al., 2011) . Dysregulation of autonomic function has been reported in the weeks/months following a COVID-19 infection (Baker et al., 2022) . It is intriguing that we see a statistically significant difference between male and female individuals, in the time variation of the RHR (Figure 4) and the time variation of the RMSSD (Figure 7) . If the modification of the RHR and the RMSSD are indeed signs of autonomic dysregulation, it is intriguing that there is a statistically significant dependence on sex.",

More unexpected is the decrease in RHR, possibly resulting in transient relative bradycardia. Approximately 1% of individuals experience a value of RHR that is at least 10 bpm lower than normal (see Figure 5 ). Sinus bradycardia is known to occur during sleep in the case of COVID-19 . Since Fitbit's measurement of RHR is not the lowest value of heart rate, this raises the possibility that the heart rate during sleep may reach dangerously low values. It is important to be aware of this transient relative bradycardia phase, since certain medications used in the treatment of COVID-19 such as Remdesivir have been known to cause bradycardia (Gupta et al., 2020; Jacinto et al., 2021; Sanchez-Codez et al., 2021) .",

A possible explanation for this may be obtained from Figure 6 and Table 1. Figure 6 shows that the peak RHR during symptom onset is positively correlated with the magnitude of the dip, i.e., a smaller peak RHR during symptom onset is associated with a larger (and possibly negative) dip. It is well known the heart rate is strongly linked to temperature, increasing by 8.5 bpm per 1\u00b0C increase in temperature, as found in one study (Karjalainen and Viitasalo, 1986) . As seen from Table 1 , males are more likely to present with a fever compared to females. Similarly, fever is more common in severe cases compared to mild cases. Thus, females as well as mild cases presenting with a small RHR increase (or no increase) are more likely to experience a bradycardia dip compared to males, or severe cases. Similarly, Figure 6 shows that the peak RHR during symptom onset is positively correlated with the height of the second tachycardia peak. As a result, the second tachycardia peak is higher in males, and for severe cases.",

A major concern is that we do not know whether the individuals who were diagnosed with COVID-19 and flu received medications to treat their illness, and what effects those medications may have had on their heart rate. Nevertheless, treatment for COVID-19 (especially for mild presentations which are most commonly seen in our data) tends to be symptomatic, e.g., antipyretics to reduce fever, analgesic medications to relieve pain, etc. It is very unlikely that patients were prescribed medications weeks following a diagnosis. The symptoms, severity, as well as symptom start date were all obtained from a survey, and could not be independently verified. We have also assumed that the participants were healthy prior to being diagnosed with COVID-19 or flu, and that the control group consisted of healthy individuals. These concerns are partially mitigated by our large sample size so that a small number of outliers are not expected to skew results. An independent investigation by clinical personnel, of the resting heart rate and heart rate variability changes in the months following a COVID-19 diagnosis will yield further credibility to our findings. Despite these limitations, the work presented in this article shows how COVID-19 and flu can alter the resting heart rate in the weeks/months following infection. This knowledge can be crucial in the case of patients with cardiac complications, or when patients are being treated with medication known to have cardiac effects.",
