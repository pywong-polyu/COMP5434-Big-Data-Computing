Unfortunately, an effective vaccine or therapeutic is not currently available, resulting in tens of thousands of hospitalizations per year. In an effort to discover a protective antibody against HPIV3, we screened the B cell repertoires from peripheral blood, tonsils, or spleen from healthy children and adults. These analyses yielded five monoclonal antibodies that potently neutralized HPIV3 in vitro. These HPIV3 neutralizing antibodies targeted two non-overlapping epitopes of the HPIV3 F protein, with most targeting the apex. Importantly, prophylactic administration of one of these antibodies, named PI3-E12, resulted in potent protection against HPIV3 infection in cotton rats. Additionally, PI3-E12 could also be used therapeutically to suppress HPIV3 in immunocompromised animals. These results demonstrate the potential clinical utility of PI3-E12 for the prevention or treatment of HPIV3 in both immunocompetent and immunocompromised individuals.",

We then enriched for HPIV3 preF-and postF-binding B cells using magnetic microbeads conjugated to antibodies targeting the fluorochrome. Using this approach, we identified B cells that specifically bound the preF conformation and not the postF conformation or fluorochrome-labeled streptavidin using flow cytometry (Fig. 1a) . Since the seroprevalence to HPIV3 in humans is almost complete 26 , we did not need to pre-screen donors for sero-positivity against HPIV3. We used this approach to assess samples of peripheral blood, tonsils and spleens from unmatched donors, since these secondary lymphoid organs might be enriched for B cells that had undergone affinity maturation for binding HPIV3. Overall, we found 0.20-1.07% of B cells in these tissues bound HPIV3 preF (Fig. 1b) . The overall frequency of IgM -IgDisotype-switched B cells was significantly increased in the spleen and tonsils (Fig. 1c, d) , as was the population of HPIV3 preF-binding B cells (Fig. 1e) .",

Over 11,000 hospitalizations per year in the US occur for fever or acute respiratory illness due to HPIV3 1 . HPIV3, like respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), infects early in life and frequently causes severe bronchiolitis and pneumonia in infants under six months of age who are unable to mount a robust antibody response 2,3 . HPIV3 is also an important cause of mortality, morbidity, and health care costs in other vulnerable populations, such as immunocompromised hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HCT) recipients 4 . Up to a third of HCT recipients acquire a respiratory viral infection within six months of transplant [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] . In up to a third of those patients, the virus progresses from the upper to the lower respiratory tract 6, 9 . Once the virus gains a foothold in the lower tract, little can be done for most viruses beyond supportive care; up to 40% of patients with lower tract disease die within three months. HPIV3 is an important cause of serious respiratory viral infections after HCT, with a cumulative incidence of 18% post-transplant at our center 5, [12] [13] [14] . In the absence of any vaccine or therapy, there is significant need for preventive and therapeutic interventions against HPIV3.",

            "text": "Neutralizing monoclonal antibodies have been correlated with protection against several respiratory viruses, including RSV and influenza [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] . The monoclonal antibody palivizumab is a humanized antibody targeting the Fusion (F) protein of RSV and was licensed for use as immunoprophylaxis to prevent severe disease in high-risk infants 20 . The F protein of RSV is an essential surface glycoprotein and therefore a major neutralizing antibody target. As a class I fusion protein, F mediates viral entry by transitioning between a metastable prefusion (preF) conformation and a stable postfusion (postF) conformation. Since preF is the major conformation on infectious virus, antibodies to preF are the most potent at neutralizing virus, whereas antibodies targeting postF generally are not 21, 22 . Similar to RSV, the F protein of HPIV3 also adopts preF and postF conformations 23, 24 . HPIV3 F was recently stabilized in the preF conformation and induced higher serum neutralizing titers than the HPIV3 postF To focus upon B cells producing neutralizing antibodies, we modified our assay to sort individual B cells onto irradiated 3T3 feeder cells expressing CD40L, IL-2, and IL-21 to allow for higher throughput screening of culture supernatants for neutralization prior to antibody cloning, as described 27 . In general, over half of sorted B cells and 87% of sorted IgD -B cells produced antibody levels detectable by ELISA (Fig. 3a) . We applied this assay to stimulate single HPIV3 preF-binding B cells and excluded IgDexpressing cells since these cells would be the least likely to have undergone the somatic hypermutation and affinity maturation necessary for potent neutralization. Using this approach, we found that 14% of IgD -HPIV3 preF-binding B cells sorted from tonsils produced HPIV3 neutralizing antibodies, as compared to 5% from the spleen and 2% from peripheral blood (Fig. 3b) .",

            "text": "From these cultures we cloned four additional HPIV3 neutralizing monoclonal antibodies named PI3-A3, PI3-B5, PI3-A10, and PI3-A12 (Fig. 3c) . Of these, PI3-A12 had the highest apparent binding affinity to HPIV3 preF, and its affinity was comparable to PI3-E12 (Fig. 3d) . The neutralization potency of these antibodies ranged from 7.0 to 61.4 ng/mL (Fig. 3c) . Each neutralizing monoclonal antibody used different immunoglobulin heavy and light chain alleles except for PI3-A3 and PI3-B5, which both utilized the kappa allele 1-5*03 (Supplemental Table 2 ). None of the alleles matched those of the previously described HPIV3 antibody PIA174 25 . The similarity to germ-line sequences of the variable genes from these neutralizing antibodies ranged from 90-97% (Supplemental Table  2 ). All of these newly described antibodies bound strongly to the preF conformation without any detectable binding to the postF conformation (Fig. 3d,  e) , as expected given the exclusion of B cells binding postF during the sort. In contrast, the previously described antibody PIA174 bound weakly to the postF conformation in addition to strong preF binding (Fig.  3e) . In anticipation of administering these antibodies in vivo, we confirmed that none bound to permeabilized HEp-2 cells (Fig. 3f) , a common assessment of autoreactivity 28, 29 . We next performed cross-competition binding experiments to gauge the antigenic sites on HPIV3 preF allowing for neutralization. Three of these five new neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (PI3-E12, -A3, and -B5) fully competed with each other and the previously described antibody PIA174 (Fig. 4a) . PI3-A10 also competed with this group, but only partially with PI3-E12 (Fig. 4a) . Based on the known binding site of PIA174, this antigenic site is likely located at the apex of HPIV3 preF 25 . We propose calling this antigenic site \u00d8 on HPIV3 preF for consistency, since the apices of RSV and HMPV preF are also called antigenic site \u00d8 30, 31 . The fifth neutralizing monoclonal, PI3-A12, only weakly competed with PI3-A10 and not at all with the others, suggesting the presence of an antigenic site vulnerable to neutralization by antibodies outside of antigenic site \u00d8 (Fig. 4a) .",

Although we could form a complex by size exclusion chromatography (SEC) of HPIV3 preF with PI3-C9 Fab, nsEM did not show bound PI3-C9 Fab molecules. 2D classifications and 3D reconstruction indicated that PI3-A12 Fab was bound to the side of HPIV3 preF in a 3:1 ratio, confirming that its epitope does not overlap with that of previously described PIA174 antibody and defining a new site of neutralization on HPIV3 preF (Fig. 4b) . Of note, this site is reminiscent of site V on RSV F 22 . As predicted earlier, 2D classifications and 3D reconstruction showed that the PI3-E12 Fab bound at the apex of HPIV3 preF in a 1:1 ratio (Fab:trimer). However, PI3-E12 Fab appears to bind HPIV3 preF with a different angle of approach compared to PIA174 (Fig. 4c) . We obtained a 5.4 \u00c5 cryo-EM structure of the PI3-E12 Fab in complex with HPIV3 preF (Fig. 4d) . Using the previously solved HPIV3-preF structure (PDB ID 6MJZ) and a 2.1 \u00c5 structure of PI3-E12 Fab that we obtained using X-ray crystallography (Fig. 4d Fig. S1 ), we were able to fit the coordinates in our low resolution cryo-EM map. The structure confirmed the slightly different angle of approach and that all the CDRs interact with the different protomers in a non-symmetrical manner. We superimposed the structure of HPIV3 preF (root mean standard deviation: 1.7 A 2 ) bound to PI3-E12 Fv or PIA174 (Fig. 4e ) which confirmed that their epitopes overlapped. Additionally, PI3-E12 used its longer CDRL1 to make quaternary contacts with 2 protomers Plaque reduction neutralization screen of supernatant from HPIV3 preF-specific B cells individually sorted and expanded on feeder cells. N=2 donors in each group with a total of 120 cells from PBMC, 120 cells from tonsils, 1,235 cells from spleen. (c) Neutralizing titers of HPIV3-specific monoclonal antibodies were determined by 60% plaque reduction neutralization tests on Vero cells using GFP-labeled HPIV3. (d) Apparent affinity (Kd) of antibody binding with HPIV3 preF at 0.5, 0.25, 0.125, and 0.0625 \u00b5M were measured by BLI. LOD stands for limit of detection. Error bars represent standard deviation. R 2 represents the coefficient of determination. Penta-HIS probes were loaded with either the (e) preF or postF conformation of HPIV3 F. Association with each mAb was then measured by BLI. All measurements are normalized against a negative control antibody. The positive control antibody is a human mAb known to bind HPIV3 postF. (f) Antinuclear antibody assay in HEp-2 cells using mAbs targeting HPIV3 preF. Binding was detected using a secondary Alexa Fluor 647 (AF647)-conjugated goat anti-human antibody. The mAb palivizumab was used as a negative control and 2F5 as a positive control for autoreactivity. The average fluorescence intensity was calculated from two independent experiments and error bars represent standard deviation. whereas the CDRH3 reaches towards the trimer axis and makes quaternary contacts with the three HPIV3 preF protomers (Fig. 4d, f) . Together, our results indicate that the HPIV3 preF apical antigenic site \u00d8 is a common target of neutralizing antibodies that can be accessed by antibodies using different gene segments and with different angles of approach.",

Although the human parainfluenza viruses do not replicate in mice, lower respiratory tract pathology and viral replication can be demonstrated in cotton rats infected intranasally with HPIV3 26, 32 . The cotton rat model was used in the past to predict not only the efficacy of antibody immunoprophylaxis but also the exact dose of palivizumab, 15 mg/kg, that would be effective against RSV in human infants 20 . Therefore, we adopted a similar experimental design and injected 0.625-5 mg/kg of PI3-E12 intramuscularly one day prior to intranasal infection of cotton rats with 10 5 pfu of HPIV3 (Fig. 5a) . None of the animals that received PI3-E12 developed significant peribronchiolitis. A trend towards higher histopathologic scores of peribronchiolitis was detected 4 days after infection in (a) Epitope binning of mAbs using the Octet system. Penta-HIS probes were coated with HIS-tagged HPIV3 preF. The mAb listed on the left-side of the chart was loaded first onto the coated probe followed by the mAb listed on the top of the chart. Values represent the level of competition between antibodies for the same binding site on HPIV3 preF. This is expressed as the percent drop in maximum signal of the top mAb in the presence of the left mAb compared to the maximum signal of the top mAb alone. Red boxes represent 80-100% competition for the same binding site, yellow boxes represent 40-80% competition, and white boxes represent 0-40% competition.

One of the goals of this study was to quantify the frequency of B cells capable of producing neutralizing antibodies against HPIV3. We designed our B cell probes and flow cytometry panel to allow the selection of B cells that bind specifically to the preF but not the postF conformation of HPIV3 F protein. Even with this selection strategy, we found that the majority of HPIV3 preF-specific B cells failed to neutralize virus. This is not surprising, since B cells undergo positive selection based on signals that stem from the affinity of binding between their immunoglobulin receptor and cognate antigen, regardless of neutralization 41, 42 . In the circulating peripheral blood of healthy individuals, the frequency of HPIV3 neutralizing B cells was only 2% of HPIV3 preFspecific B cells. As a result, our original strategy of sorting and directly cloning antibodies from individual HPIV3 preF-specific B cells from peripheral blood identified predominantly low-affinity na\u00efve B cells, was laborious, expensive, and inefficient, and yielded only a single neutralizing monoclonal antibody. Therefore, we switched to a higher-throughput neutralization screening strategy for HPIV3 based upon an assay developed for HIV 43 . This allowed us to scan thousands of individual B cells from peripheral blood, tonsils, and spleens and select only those that produced neutralizing antibodies against HPIV3 for subsequent monoclonal antibody cloning. Using this method, we confirmed the low frequency of HPIV3 preF-specific B cells able to produce neutralizing antibodies and isolated four additional potent HPIV3 neutralizing monoclonal antibodies.",

We decided to compare the frequency of B cells capable of producing neutralizing antibodies in readily accessible secondary lymphoid organs that might be enriched for B cells that had undergone affinity maturation. We therefore sampled human tonsils from children undergoing elective tonsillectomy and human spleens from previously healthy adult deceased organ donors. Since virtually all children by the age of three demonstrate serologic evidence of infection by parainfluenza virus, we did not need to screen donors for evidence of previous infection 26 . We found that tonsils were significantly enriched with B cells capable of producing HPIV3 neutralizing monoclonal antibodies. Although tonsillectomy is a common procedure and has long been thought to have negligible long-term costs, more recent data suggests tonsillectomy may be associated with increased long-term risks for respiratory infections 45 . Human spleens were also enriched for B cells capable of neutralizing HPIV3, although the magnitude of enrichment was much lower than in tonsils.",

The ability of PI3-E12 to bind the apex of HPIV3 preF in a ratio of 1 Fab : 1 trimer is also reminiscent of the binding mode of VRC26.25, the most potent HIV V1V2-recognizing antibody isolated to date 47 . PI3-E12 showed high specificity for the prefusion conformation of HPIV3 F, unlike the previously isolated apical binding monoclonal antibody PIA174 which bound weakly to the post-fusion conformation. The ability of PIA174 to bind the post-fusion conformation was unexpected since the antigenic site at the apex is unique to the prefusion conformation. In the related fusion protein of RSV, the apical antigenic site consists of an unstructured region and an alpha helix which are displaced by more than 5 \u00c5 in the post-fusion conformation 48 . It is possible that PIA174 is able to bind weakly to small stretches of linear epitopes found in both the pre-and post-fusion conformations. Interestingly, the monoclonal antibodies we isolated all utilized different immunoglobulin heavy and light chain alleles. A similar phenomenon was previously described in which human antibodies targeting the receptor binding site of hemagglutinin were found to arise from nearly unrestricted germ-line origins from multiple donors, and as a result viral resistance to one antibody did not confer resistance to all 49 . This suggests a wide variety of evolved solutions to the problem of blocking viral attachment and binding are available in the general population, making this antigenic site an appealing vaccine target 50 .",

            "text": "We focused our efforts on determining the in vivo efficacy of PI3-E12, because it was among the most potent neutralizing antibody against site \u00d8. Given the in vitro potency of PI3-E12, we anticipated a low EC50. Similar to palivizumab for RSV, a dose of at least 2.5 mg/kg reduced HPIV3 levels in the lungs in virtually all animals. Additionally, 5 mg/kg of PI3-E12 significantly reduced HPIV3 replication in the nose, in contrast to palivizumab which failed to suppress RSV replication in the nose even at a dose of 8 mg/kg 51, 52 . Given the ability of PI3-E12 to suppress HPIV3 replication in the nose and lungs of immunocompromised animals when given after infection, PI3-E12 could play a role in both prophylaxis or therapy against HPIV3 infections in the HCT population. Testing the in vivo efficacy of potent HPIV3 neutralizing antibodies at additional, later timepoints in cotton rats and non-human primates would provide further insights into the therapeutic window. We have recently described a method of engineering B cells using CRISPR/Cas9 to express palivizumab and conferred protection against RSV in na\u00efve animals by adoptive transfer of these cells 53 . In this revolutionary new age of cellular therapy and immunotherapy against cancer, it is conceivable that B cells could be engineered to produce a variety of protective antibodies against multiple pathogens and transferred along with the stem cell product during transplant as part of treatment for an underlying disease.",

Crystals used for diffraction data were grown in the following conditions in solution containing 0.2 M ammonium phosphate monobasic, 0.1 M Tris, pH 8.5, and 50% (+/\u2212) 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol. Crystals were cryoprotected in Parabar Oil (Hampton). Crystals diffracted to 2.1 \u00c5 (Supplemental Table 3 ). Data was collected on the Fred Hutch X-ray home source and processed using HKL2000 57 . The structure was solved by molecular replacement using Phaser in CCP4 (Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4), and the Fab portion of PDB accession number 6MFT was used as a search model 25, 58 . Iterating rounds of structure building and refinement was performed in COOT 59 and Phenix 60 . Structural figures were made with Pymol 61 and Chimera 62 .",

A total of ~5 nL sample, dispensed as 50 pL droplets, was applied in a stripe across each grid, followed by a pause of a few milliseconds, before the grid was plunged into liquid ethane. The grids were imaged using a Titan Krios G3 TEM (FEI) at 300-kV accelerating voltage and liquid nitrogen temperature. The images were recorded (FEI) on a Falcon 3EC direct electron detector (FEI) operated in electron-counting mode using Serial EM 69 .

Monoclonal antibody was either administered intramuscularly one day prior to infection or one day after infection. Cyclophosphamide (50 mg/kg) was administered intramuscularly at 21 days prior to infection and readministered every three days for the duration of experiments involving immunosuppression. Nasal turbinates were removed for viral titration by plaque assay at day four post-infection. Lungs were removed for viral titration by plaque assay and histopathology at day four post-infection. Lung and nose homogenates were clarified by centrifugation in EMEM (Gibco). Confluent HEp-2 monolayers were inoculated in duplicate with diluted homogenates in 24-well plates. After incubating for two hours at 37\u00b0C, wells were overlaid with 0.75% methylcellulose. After four days, the cells were fixed and stained with 0.1% crystal violet for one hour, and plaques were counted to determine titers as pfu per gram of tissue. Histopathology was performed by inflating dissected lungs with 10% formalin, immersing in 10% formalin, embedding in paraffin, sectioning, and staining with hematoxylin and eosin. Slides were scored blind on a 0-4 severity scale. The scores are subsequently converted to a 0-100% histopathology scale as previously described 35, 72 .",
