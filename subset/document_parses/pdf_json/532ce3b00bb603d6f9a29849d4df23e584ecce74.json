Able to code will be an advantage and a necessity when the students join the workforce. After not small amount of budget and time has been spent by the country for this mission, there are several issues that need to be considered and worked on to ensure coding lessons in schools achieves the target. This paper presents six issues and the recommended solutions that do not require a change to the current educations system as frequent changes in national education policy will burden teachers, parents and students. The identified issues are from the perspective of language of communication, implementation and execution, digital divide, quality tools, assessments and teaching and learning time. This works suggests to create a self-learning system built specifically for the national secondary schools' syllabus, short-term job exemption for teachers and programming skill test to replace project as part of assessments to increase the rate of teaching effectiveness of Computer Science subjects, especially programming. This study will be of great important to educational planners, school authorities, educational researchers and the governments.",

They need to learn skills to do the job that their country's economy needs. With the advent of IR 4.0, our country needs experts in Artificial Intelligence and IT-related disciplines. Programming is one of the essential skills that one need to master in if they want to be expert in IT-related disciplines. If we are able to produce high-skilled students in programming, the country will be able to produce many system makers, while reducing the dependency on outsiders. This research aims to identify the issues and challenges in teaching and learning coding among secondary school students of national schools in Malaysia. Any proposal to change the current setting of teaching programming in national schools will be avoided as frequent change of education system may not be preferred by both the government and citizens. As, such, this study will be based on the Malaysia Education Development Plan (MEDP). MEDP contains five system aspirations and six student characteristics that our country plan to achieve over the next 13 years, from 2013 to 2025. It is a comprehensive manifestation of government transformation for students from pre-school to university. Apart from educational planners, school authorities and the governments, the findings of this research will be useful to the researchers that plan to conduct research in teaching and learning coding for school students.",

While Malaysia Language is believed to be able to increase understanding of majority of the students and preserving heritage, using English on the other hand will give more advantages such as global application and wide access to external materials. Currently, most of the national schools use Malaysia/Malay Language in school for teaching Computer Science subject. While teaching the theories of Computer Science in the students' native language may not disclose any flaws, the students will start to show the signs of unexciting when they are required to search for additional information pertaining to programming by themselves. The difference between language used in schools and the language used later when to search for information has caused some problems, because many of the external online resources that can be used to help the students learn coding are in English. This issue becomes more prominent due to the gap in English proficiency between urban and rural students. Ibrahim et al. [7] and Maros et al. [8] reported that despite going through the same curriculum, the level of English proficiency in rural schools is much lower than the level in the urban schools. Referring to an example of a scenario related to the mother tongue, a study conducted by Ibrahim et al. [7] proves that a large number of errors identified in the English assignments used as the testing materials due to mother tongue interference. The study by Ibrahim et al. [7] was conducted among young Malay learners in Malaysian secondary schools.",

Thus, a survey needs to be conducted to identify whether the usage of English really cause a problem or not. And if yes, at which particular aspects really bothering the teachers and students? Does it relate to teaching resources, medium of communication, or learning resources? This is important as if the language is not the main problem, we can maintain the existing teaching methods so that efforts can be focused on improving other aspects. With the emergence of social media platforms, with many students have accessed to it, will the exposure to the \"computer language\" is enough for the students to at least identity the learning resources by themselves? What is the relation between ability to identify the right learning resources and English language? The answer is, the secondary school students sometimes become clueless on the choice of keywords to be used when to search for resources using search engine. They are not sure or cannot even think of any suitable keywords to be used in searching. When too many irrelevant information displayed after the arbitrary searching, they will waste too much time in filtering for the right information that suits to their needs. To conclude what has been discussed before, it is important for the country to identify whether it is correct that language is a barrier to effective programming learning, especially for those who are interested in self-study.",

The desire of the Ministry of Education Malaysia to produce competitive students to face the IR 4.0 era is indeed commendable. However, there are some issues that need to be identified to ensure that the original planning of the country is in line with what has been presented in the education plan. Ideally, if the teaching of Computer Science involves a practical class, the ratio between teacher and students shall be around less than 30 students per teacher. This ratio is suitable for university undergraduate level program. However, for school level, the number of students per lab session shall be less than 20 students. This recommendation is based on the authors' experience of conducting programming lab for more than 10 years. From a study conducted by Olanrewaju and Oluyomi [10] to 150 students taking Physics in one of the secondary schools in Nigeria, it is recommended that stakeholders should put more effort into ensure that the class size is reduced to teacher-students ratio of 1:35. Any subject that requires hands-on skills does require a small class size to give teachers the opportunity to focus on students with different levels of learning mastery. Since learning to program is difficult [11] due to its nature that involves correctness of logic, syntax, and semantics; programming is a subject that is definitely included in the subject group that requires a hands-on approach.",

If most developed countries use a school-based assessment system [13] , assessment that focuses more on academic achievement through formal national examinations is still regard as the best practice so far for developing countries like Malaysia. While cultivating the knowledge without putting a burden to the student with examination, apart from general examinations such as PT3 and SPM, conducting one standard test to assess the level of mastery of programming skills among secondary schools' students has not yet been made uniformly. A good programming assessment system is able to form students who truly master the desired skills for the future, not just learn to pass the exam. To the best of the author's knowledge, no specific study has been conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of public examinations on the formation of programming skills.",

Despite the complete and advance mobile infrastructure in the developed world, the digital divide still exists in developing countries [14] . As for Internet connection, even though Malaysia (together with Singapore and Brunei) has been listed as one of the three countries in South East Asia that have over 80% Internet penetration, there are certain places in Malaysia have poor Internet service. For example, in Kuala Lumpur, people are enjoying high-speed Internet up to 800 MBps. At the same time, in Sarawak (East Malaysia), the Internet speed is much slower, with some areas in the state without any access to Internet service [15] . Even when online access is available, some challenges persist. As a developing region, in Southeast Asia, many students are from economically vulnerable families. Their access to computers is limited to school-provided computer labs, and many do not have access to unlimited Internet on their mobile devices [15] . The rural areas will have some issues in implementing Computer Science education in their schools due to administrative and facility barriers. To learn coding, the students are going to need not just the teachers but also the facilities. The schools that will have the facilities will be those from the wealthier and more developed regions. The urban areas will likely have the facilities and support, leaving the urban areas further behind. Despite of all the issues discussed before, digital divide is sometimes not seen as a problem because Computer Science subjects are only offered by schools that have computer labs and teachers trained in ICT. Or in other words, programming is just an optional skill or value-added for students rather than a compulsory subject.",

Apart from the appealing print layouts and illustrations, the success stories and achievements pertaining to computer science in Malaysia are also included as an element of motivation to the students. Most of the text books mentioned the careers in computer science. This is good indeed as even though Malaysia had been introduced to IT since the emergence of Multimedia Super Corridor (MSC) in year 1996, the careers in IT are still not widely known. Refer to [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] for all the electronic text books of Computer-science related subjects starting from year six to fifth-form. All the text books are published in Malaysia/Malay language. The contents of the books are all well-crafted with full of meaningful information. In the government policy, students are encouraged to learn at self-paced, do self-accessed and self-assessed [22] . However, the quality digital tool for coding subjects, developed tailor to the needs of national school students is yet to be created. Despite of the excellent quality of the current text books adopted by national schools' students, use of tools is really needed. A quality digital tool is believed to contribute to high quality lessons since they have potential to increase students' motivation, connect students to many information sources, support active in-class and out-class learning environments, and let instructors to allocate more time for facilitation [23] . By still using the case study conducted in Malaysia, there was a recommendation that wants application to be developed to solely focus on education, in which the students will not be able to access other things apart of the learning contents [14] . It can also be seen that the use of reiterative independent method has high potential to be adopted in future applications. Reiterative independent method, is a method that instills in students the skills and mindset for learning new materials without being directly taught. This method is similar to the established method named Kumon [24, 25] .",

The SPM or the Malaysian Certificate of Education, is a national examination taken by all fifth-form (17 years old students) secondary school students in Malaysia. Another one is PT3, which is a summative assessment to assess the academic achievement of students at the lower secondary level in Malaysia. PT3 is taken by all third-form (15 years old students) secondary school students in Malaysia. Table 1 shows the examinations conducted for computer science-related subjects offered starting from year 2019. Programming courses were assessed in these two major national examinations. As for school-level examination, there is no specific format imposed to the examinations' questions. The schools are free to construct the questions that suit to their school's students. The information of major examinations in Malaysia are as of stated in [26] . The percentage of assessment for Basic Computer Science subject of PT3 examination is 70% allocated for written examinations and 30% for individual project that was assigned for the students to complete in about 6 months (from March to August). For the project, the PT3 candidates are required to translate ideas by writing step-by-step solutions in pseudocode and flow charts, which lastly translated into a program. The students are also required to analyze and compare method of program development, test, detect, and fix errors of program [27] . Example of project question for SPM candidates is to develop business information management system [28] . Since there is a need for students to master programming for the purpose of getting good grades for general examinations, this is seen to indirectly motivate students to practice what they have learned for the previous 2 years. Written examinations accompanied by projects are seen as complete enough to assess students' performance in mastering the subject. However, the question here is, is the learning process that students go through to face exams able to shape students towards mastering programming skills? Or, would it be possible that students who obtained A-and above in the major examination, actually do not have practical skills? One more thing, after completing SPM, students in Malaysia can choose whether to continue their studies by taking either a certificate, diploma, matriculation or sixth-form. At this stage if students choose the science stream, they will take subjects such as Mathematics, Physics, Biology, English and Chemistry. Only students who take the Foundation in Computer Science continue to study Computer Science related subjects such as basic programming, introduction to algorithms and some mathematics related subjects. It can be seen here that if students do not choose the basic course of Computer Science, there is a gap of one to two years before they continue their studies at the level of Computer Science degree. This results in what was previously learned cannot be practiced at the degree level.",

In the next study, we intend to obtain information directly from teachers, students and policy makers to verify validity. Based on the issues identified earlier, the main solution is short-term job exemption to give teachers the opportunity to create a simple system to practice programming. Programming is not suitable for learning in situations where it is still necessary to perform other teaching tasks. In terms of academic assessment, all the solutions proposed in this paper are on the assumption that we still maintain the current syllabus which still requires students to learn about other theories, not programming alone. It is suggested that academic assessment should be based on a small percentage (30%) allocated to assess theory or knowledge in topics such data representation and algorithm reconstruction, and another 70% is for programming. Programming questions should not be in written format, instead allowing students to use a compiler to get answers. Examinations that take into account the project should be avoided because with the shortage of study time, it is feared that the project will be done not in a situation where students are interested in learning something but only to pass the exam. For long-term strategy, we should assess the sequence of the programming languages taught to the students. There are several issues that shall be considered which are presented in a form of the following questions; (1) is it necessary for the students to be exposed to several languages throughout their years of study? (2); did we consider the continuation of study? For example: After the student had completed learning Python in second-form and third-form, how does that knowledge is bringing forward to fourth-form and fifth-form?",

Since finding solutions to the problem of limited learning time is quite difficult as it involves major issues such as logistics and financial allocation, the provision of a self-learning system needs to be provided. An in-house learning tool developed tailor to the specific needs of national schools' students and teachers is needed. Another issue that is worth to be discussed is pertaining to the interesting elements incorporated into the current text books. Direct link to the web site for additional information via the scanned QR codes and interesting project for the students to try, are some of the examples appealing current text book features of Malaysia schools. Undoubtedly, all these latest elements are very interesting and innovations like this are indeed to be commended.
