She was diagnosed in the first days of her life, presenting with meconium ileus requiring surgery and CF newborn screening positive, being homozygous for the c.1521_1523delCTT (p.F508del) CF-causing mutation of the Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator (CFTR) gene. During her followup, she developed chronic lung disease with bronchiectasis complicated by Pseudomonas aeruginosa intermittent respiratory infection. She was under treatment with pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy and multivitamin supplementation and received CFTR modulator therapy with lumacaftor/ivacaftor from July 2019. In March 2020, she was referred to our Emergency Department for persisting cough with purulent expectoration and dyspnea. At hospital admission, she presented good general conditions, apyretic (T 36.8 \u2022 C) and tachypneic with oxygen desaturation (SpO2 93%). Physical examination revealed diffuse pulmonary crackles. Chest X-ray showed diffuse interlobular septal thickening with parenchymal infiltrates in the right hilus and the nasopharyngeal swab tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. The patient was hospitalized at the Pediatric COVID-19 Unit of the Pediatrics Clinic of Spedali Civili where she was treated with hydroxychloroquine 200 mg twice a day, according to our internal COVID-19 diagnostic and therapeutic protocol, broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy with cefotaxime, chest physiotherapy with positive expiratory pressure mask, and oxygen supplementation. Two days after the beginning of this therapy, the patient reported an improvement of pulmonary symptoms no longer requiring oxygen supplementation. During the hospitalization, she did not present fever or any other symptoms related to COVID-19. She was discharged after 10 days when two distinct nasopharyngeal swabs tested negative for SARS-CoV-2. After discharge, the patient continued the scheduled follow-up visits at the Cystic Fibrosis Regional Support Center. At the latest visit, she exhibited a FEV1 of 91% without presenting any complications related to the previous SARS-CoV-2 infection.",

All patients were tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 at nasopharyngeal swab and presented mild or moderate course of COVID-19, without evidence of previous chronic respiratory diseases. All of them showed fever at the onset of symptoms, while only four patients manifested gastrointestinal symptoms. The other four patients reported influenza-like symptoms (rhinitis and cough). Chest X-ray showed interstitial thickening in 14 out of 23 cases, but only two children needed respiratory support: one with high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) for a few days, and the other one with free-flow oxygen via facemask. Blood samples for plasma cytokine analysis were collected at the time of hospitalization prior to any treatment.",

This is surprising considering that in CF, the respiratory tracts are more susceptible to upregulated inflammation, particularly when triggered by new infectious agents (9, 31) . In addition, because the CF patient was receiving treatment with lumacaftor/ivacaftor during COVID-19 episode, we speculate that treatment with CFTR modulators did not have a detrimental effect on the outcome of the disease and raises the question of the potential role of these drugs on regulating immune response or angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) expression. Although further studies are needed to answer these relevant questions, it is notable that levels of cytokines and chemokines in the other CF patients treated with lumacaftor/ivacaftor were in the same range as those in untreated CF patients.",

Moreover, it has been postulated that mutations in the CFTR gene may alter the protein expression of ACE2 through upregulation of vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEFGA) in such a way to mitigate the effects of infection on lung damage (9, 34) . Furthermore, in vitro experiments on CF bronchial epithelial lines (CFBEs) showed no evidence that mutations in CFTR induce a hyperinflammatory response in CF epithelial cells (35) , suggesting that other unknown regulatory mechanisms could be involved in the regulation of inflammation in CF cell lines. It has been presumed that epigenetic phenomena, such as DNA methylation or histone tail modification profiles, could modulate the gene expression and that could be cell-line specific, independent from F508 mutation (34) .",

Interestingly, IL-6, CXCL8, CCL2, CCL5, and CXCL10 plasmatic concentrations were lower during the COVID-19 infectious episode as compared to levels measured 1 month earlier. These cytokines persisted low when reevaluated after 1 month, suggesting that immune response against SARS-CoV-2 infection was not associated with increased inflammatory response.",
