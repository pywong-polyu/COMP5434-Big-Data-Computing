Personal protective equipment has been mandatory for healthcare workers in order to contain the outbreak of pandemic disease. Mild neurological disturbances such as headache have been related to the extensive utilization of facemask. This study aims to examine headache variations related to the intensive utilization of facemask among a cohort of healthcare professionals in a setting of low-medium risk of exposure to SARS-CoV-2. Methods This is a cross-sectional study among healthcare providers from different hospital and clinics in Italy. Each participant completed a specifically designed self-administered questionnaire. Headache features and outcome measures' change from baseline were evaluated over a 4-month period, in which wearing facemask has become mandatory for Italian healthcare workers. Results A total of 400 healthcare providers completed the questionnaire, 383 of them met the inclusion criteria. The majority were doctors, with a mean age of 33.4 \u00b1 9.2 years old. Among 166/383 subjects, who were headache free at baseline, 44 (26.5%) developed de novo headache. Furthermore, 217/383 reported a previous diagnosis of primary headache disorder: 137 were affected by migraine and 80 had tension-type headache. A proportion (31.3%) of these primary headache sufferers experienced worsening of their pre-existing headache disorder, mainly for migraine frequency and attack mean duration. Conclusions Our data showed the appearance of de novo associated facemask headache in previous headache-free subjects and an exacerbation of pre-existing primary headache disorders, mostly experienced by people with migraine disease.",

On March 11, World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 outbreak a global pandemic [1] [2] [3] . To date, there are nearly 87.4 million confirmed COVID-19-affected patients worldwide. The first imported cases in Italy were on 23 January 2020 in a couple of Chinese tourists [4] , and it is now reaching the number of 2.2 million, with around 77,000 deaths [5] . On March 8, 2020 , the Italian Government implemented extraordinary measures to limit viral transmission, such as city lockdowns and movement restriction, initially in the region of Lombardy, then extended to the entire nation (phase I) [6] . On May 16, 2020, the Italian Government declared the suspension of the extraordinary measures, but people are suggested to keep social distancing and wear facemask (phase II) [7] . SARS-CoV-2, like other coronaviruses, spread by respiratory droplets; therefore, personal protective equipment (PPE) has become mandatory for healthcare workers while attending to patients, in order to contain the outbreak of pandemic disease [8] . In particular, both surgical and close-fitting N95 facemasks create a barrier between individuals limiting the aerosol spread of viruses [8] . Thus, in clinical practice, masking has become a standard among frontline healthcare personnel against COVID-19 [9] . Wearing PPE for a long period led to physical distress [10] and could induce subjective negative symptoms, such as dizziness, perceived shortness of air, and headache [11] . During the 2003 SARS epidemic, researchers highlighted the association between complaints of new-onset headache and use of N95 facemask in healthcare providers working in high-risk areas [12] . A recent study described the developing of PPE-associated headache in frontline medical and paramedical staff during COVID-19 pandemic, especially in emergency department professionals who combined daily use of N95 facemask and protective eyewear [13] . Moreover, a symptoms' worsening of pre-existing primary headaches due to continuative masking has been also described [13] . Authors showed that PPE-associated headache fulfilled the International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD-3) criteria for external-compression headache (ECH), defined as \"headache starting within one hour from compression of pericranial soft tissues and resolving within one hour after external compression is relieved\" [14] . The aim of our study was to evaluate the impact of facemask wearing on headache in two different categories of healthcare workers: subjects with and without pre-existing diagnosis of primary headache disorder.",

            "text": "This cross-sectional study has been conducted during Italian phase II. We enrolled different healthcare professionals including doctors, nurses, healthcare assistants, and other paramedical staff such as technicians, physiotherapists, and psychologists, from numerous Italian hospitals and clinics. Written informed consent was obtained from each participant and the study was approved by the local institutional review board. Each enrolled subject completed a specifically designed self-administered questionnaire written in Italian language. Participants were directly invited to complete the questionnaire form throughout their personal web-email. The questionnaire consisted in 5 query sections: I-demographics (gender, age, occupation), comorbidities, and type of work during the COVID-19 Italian phase II: active or smart working; II-phenotype, associated features, outcome measures, related disability of any primary headache disorder diagnosed before COVID-19 outbreak; III-phenotype, associated features, outcome measures, related disability of any headache disorder experienced after mandatory healthcare workers facemasking during phase II; IV-participants' personal impression about the impact of face-masking on headache disorder; V-facemask use information (number of weekly work hours, number of daily hours wearing facemask, type of facemask used, type of facemask elastic head straps: occipital or preauricular). We excluded subjects who keep performing smart working after lockdown period; only active workers have been included in the study. Afterwards, we excluded participants with comorbidities likely to be cause of secondary headaches. We evaluated headache profile and outcome measures over a 30-day period before the beginning of lockdown period (baseline, T0) and during the first 4 months of Italian phase II (T1: average of four months). To assess headache profile change from T0 to T1, different patient-reported outcome measures have been used. The outcome measures (headache days (HD), migraine days (MD), migraine-like day (MLD), average headache severity (AHS)) were retrospectively collected, through the questionnaire, in line with the Initiative on Methods, Measurement, and Pain Assessment in Clinical Trials (IMMPACT) [16] . Localization (unilateral or bilateral), pain quality (throbbing, pressing or tightening and stabbing), headache duration (hours), and AHS through numerical rating scale (NRS-0 (no head pain) to 10 (most severe head pain ever experienced)) were recorded. A headache day (HD) was considered a day with headache lasting for \u2265 4 h and with a severity of \u2265 4/10 on NRS. A de novo headache was recorded whether at least one HD was reported at T1. A migraine day (MD) was defined according to the IHS migraine classification criteria [15] . Associated symptoms such as phonophobia/photophobia and nausea/vomit have also been recorded. A migraine-like day (MLD) was defined as a day in which the subject reported headache with associated symptoms which did not fulfill IHS criteria for MD. Headache-related disability change between T0 and T1 was collected using headache impact test (HIT-6) [17] . The 12item allodynia symptom checklist (ASC-12) has been used to score allodynia at T0 and T1; moreover, a supplementary item has been added to the aforementioned scale to assess the impact of elastic head straps on allodynia at T1. A subject was considered allodynic if ASC-12 score was greater than 2 [18] . We also investigated abortive treatment consumption, including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS; episodic consumption (1-9/month); frequent consumption (10-14/ month); abuse (\u2265 15/month)), triptans (episodic consumption (1-9/month); abuse (\u2265 10/month)), and other pain killer drugs (episodic consumption (1-9/month); frequent consumption (10-14/month); abuse (\u2265 15/month)) used for attempted headache relief. Pre-existing preventive treatments used for primary headache disorders and any preventive treatment switch have been also recorded. Participants' subjective impression about the impact of facemask on headache disorder was evaluated through adaptation of Patient's Global Impression of Change (PGIC) scale: a score of 0 means \"no change\" and a score of 10 means \"dramatic worsening\" [20] .",

Moreover, they declared wearing facemask for an average from 6 to 10 h a day. The surgical facemask with pre-auricular elastic head straps was the most common type of facemask used (see Table 1 ). At baseline, 217/383 subjects were affected by a primary headache disorder (headache group (HG)) and 166/383 were headache free (non-headache group (NHG)), suggesting that those with pre-existing headaches were more likely to complete the questionnaire. There were no differences between groups for age (p = 0.428), but they differ for sex: subjects of HG group were mainly women (p \u2264 0.001). The groups were not different for mean weekly work hours and mean daily hours wearing facemask (see Table 1 ). To notice that 74/383 participants (19.3%) declared that they wear facemask for less than 6 h a day, hence less than a usual 6-h work shift.",

De novo headache was mainly described with tension-type features (pressing or tightening quality, bilateral localization, moderate intensity of pain and mild associated symptoms like phonophobia and/or photophobia, nausea, and/or vomit). Moreover, a proportion of de novo headache sufferers reported an abnormal scalp sensitivity or discomfort during headache attacks elicited by non-noxious stimuli (allodynia), including the elastic head straps. PPE-associated headaches were first studied by Lim et al., during southeast Asiatic SARS epidemic in the early 2000s [12] . Stress, mechanical factors, hypoxemia, and hypercapnia have been considered mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of facemaskassociated headache [11, 19, 20] . A recent study tried to clarify the correlation between increased PPE exposure of frontline healthcare workers during COVID-19 pandemic and development of de novo headaches [13] . This study described de novo PPE-associated headache as a subtype of external-pressure It is known that mechanic forces exerted by individual PPE on cranial surface may lead both to local tissue damage and irritation on the superficial sensory nerves innervating cranial and cervical region [21] . Particularly, healthcare professionals undergo an important and prolonged cervical or pre-auricular stress related to elastic straps, which may explain the tensiontype headache developed by the majority of subjects involved in our study [22] [23] [24] .

Among non-headache group (NHG) including headache-free subjects at T0, 44 subjects developed de novo headache at T1: the vast majority developed episodic headache (1-4 days/month). Subjects belonging to migraine-headache group (MHG) and tension-type headache group (TTHG) had mainly episodic headache at T0, and a considerable number of subjects developed a high frequency headache at T1. Moreover, a small number of subjects developed a chronic headache, mainly in MHG Fig. 3 Allodynia among MHG, TTHG, and NHG-DN from T0 to T1. Number of allodynic subjects significantly increased only in non-headache group de novo (NHG-DN) from T0 to T1, whereas there was no statistically significant modification for migraine-headache group (MHG) and tension-type headache group (TTHG) (a). The boxplot revealed that severity of allodynia expressed through ASC-12 score was greater for MHG and NHG-DN rather than TTHG at T1 (b) order neurons in the brainstem. Moreover, afferent trigeminal nerves terminate in C2 spinal segments together with greater occipital nerve afferents [25] . The prolonged mechanical stress on both cervical and pre-auricular regions may cause peripheral sensitization and consequently the activation of trigeminocervical complex, thus stimulating cortical areas triggering headache attacks [26, 27] . Furthermore, peripheral sensitization is crucial to induce and maintain central sensitization process, which determines temporal, spatial, and threshold changes in pain sensibility, generating pain hypersensitivity and allodinya [28] [29] [30] .",

We speculate that sustained mechanical stimulus exerted by elastic straps may cause biochemical alterations which induce a decrease of pain threshold and increased tenderness in these subjects which predispose to headache chronification [31] . Moreover, TTHG participants reported the appearance/worsening of associated symptoms like nausea while wearing facemask. Nausea is commonly reported by migraine sufferers and is associated with impaired functioning and decrease of quality of life. There is some evidence that frequent headache-related nausea may predict chronic headache [32] . Therefore, it is reasonable that associated symptoms may contribute to headache chronification and worsening of headache-related disability.",

Indeed, MHG presented a remarkable worsening of headache frequency mainly for HD, while MD resulted non-significantly changed. Moreover, attack mean duration, AHS, and allodynia significantly worsened at T1. These findings reflect different biology of migraine which could be considered a disorder of brain sensory processing [27] . Thus, facemask could exert a sustained mechanical stimulus triggering headache attacks. Furthermore, it might determine changes in central nervous system through alterations in nociceptive thresholds and alterations in pain pathways producing peripheral and central s e n s i t i z a t i o n . O n c e s e n s i t i z a t i o n e s t a b l i s h e d , trigeminovascular neuron activation becomes stimulusindependent and maintains itself in the absence of sensory input later on [33] . Central sensitization is crucial for migraine progression [34] . Cutaneous allodynia could be considered the hallmark of central sensitization, and it has already been reported as an independent predictor of migraine chronification. According to literature data and in line with our results, cutaneous allodynia is associated with higher frequency of migraine and longer migraine duration [35] .",

We also acknowledge several limitations in our work. As first limitation, participants were not asked if their headache started within 1 h after wearing facemask or if they experienced headache relief within 1 h after unmasking, making difficult the hypothetical diagnosis of both external-compression (4.6.1) and external-traction (4.6.2) headache according to the ICHD-3 criteria [14]. Our self-administered questionnaire only included two closeended questions on headache attacks' duration and number of daily hours wearing facemask. The majority (79.5%) of NHG-DN respondents experienced a mean duration of the headache attacks < 12 h; the remaining 20.5% reported a longer duration, regardless of facemask donning time (Table 1) . Moreover, a multivariate (multiple) linear regression analysis did not reveal a significative relationship between the variable \"hours wearing facemask\" and the outcome measure \"headache attack mean duration.\"",

Factors other than facemask type and elastic head straps, such as psychological stress, sleep disturbances, and change in lifestyle (i.e., dehydration and skipping meals), were not included in the study. Hence, we recognize that different factors might have triggered headache, mainly in frontline healthcare providers working in high-risk areas and suffering with a pre-existing primary headache disorder. However, our questionnaire was administered during phase II, when the number of COVID-19 cases and, consequently, the pressure on the national healthcare system were remarkably reduced; therefore, we speculate a minor impact of the aforementioned factors.",
