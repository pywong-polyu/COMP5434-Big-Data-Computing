While in the beginning of the pandemic the number of SARS-CoV-2 positive patients requiring intensive care was unknown, the rate settled at around 1-2% during the second period [2] . Due to numerous influencing factors different cohorts from various areas have demonstrated widely varying mortality rates and characteristics of intensive care unit (ICU) patients. A meta-analysis published in June 2020 found ICU mortality rates ranging from 14-84% [3] , which has shown the importance of observing regional conditions separately in order to have a better understanding of major factors influencing outcome [4] .",

These numbers correspond to the dynamics of the pandemic in Austria [1] . As mentioned in our previous paper we The 107 patients from the first wave have been previously reported [4] . IQR interquartile range, ICU intensive care unit, AKI acute kidney injury, KDIGO kidney disease: improving global outcomes, LOS length of stay, CPR cardiopulmonary resuscitation, IMV invasive mechanical ventilation, ECMO extracorporeal membrane oxygenation had established an ICU resource management, which avoided overcrowding of ICU and healthcare system decompensation. This was also successful during the second wave; however, to maintain unrestricted access to the ICU, improvements in the treatment of critically ill COVID-19 patients were necessary. Major progress has been made in ventilation treatment, as reflected in lower rates and duration of IMV in the second period. Corresponding to the reduction of IMV, the number of patients who only required NIV or HFNC was higher during the second period ( Table 2) . A similar decrease of IMV use has been reported from other cohorts [13, 14] . Several factors may be responsible for this finding. First of all the change of the rate of IMV corresponds to the change of recommendations regarding timing of intubation [15] . High rates of mechanical ventilation in critically ill patients and a rapid deterioration have been reported from China [16] and Italy [10] . Therefore, in the beginning, early intubation was considered beneficial not only for ICU staff due to less aerosol exposure but also for the patients. Respiratory treatment with NIV and HFNC have been proven to avoid invasive ventilation in comparison to a standard oxygen mask [17] . Although NIV and HFNC are important and might have the ability to protect patients from IMV, late failure of NIV may increase mortality in these patients [18] ; however, randomized controlled trials are necessary to answer the question of optimal timing of intubation. Additionally, the significantly increased use of corticosteroids in the second wave, after the results of the RECOVERY trial were published, may have contributed to a reduced need and duration of invasive ventilation [6, 19] .",

While ICU mortality did not change significantly, hospital mortality increased. Some studies found improved mortality rates over time, whereas others found no differences [13, 14, 23, 24] ; however, comparison to different ICU cohorts may be difficult due to the numerous influencing factors on the ICU population [25] . Additionally, the mortality we found in our first wave was already very low with 22.4% [4] . This remarkably low mortality rate has been discussed in detail [4] . Furthermore, a hospital mortality of 33.4% (second wave) in critically ill patients is still lower or similar compared to other studies [10, 12, 26] and was below the Austrian average. This indicates a successful ICU resource management as was already the case in the first wave.",

In our logistic regression model age was an independent predictor of hospital mortality after adjustment for other baseline characteristics (Table 4 ). In other studies, age was the strongest predictor for mortality in critically ill patients [27] . This is also supported by the Kaplan-Meier analysis, showing a significant association between older age and impaired hospital survival (Fig. 4) . This raises the question why the median age changed in our cohort. To date, few studies have looked at the differences between the first and second wave of hospitalized and ICU patients in the COVID-19 pandemic [13, 14, 23, 24] ; however, no analysis found similar changes of age distribution over time [13, 14, 23, 24] . Our overall median age was relatively high compared to other cohorts from the first wave [10, 16, 28] . A country comparable in terms of overall age distribution such as Germany had similar median age in patients requiring invasive mechanical ventilation [26] . Furthermore, it cannot be ruled out that a change in admission policy over time contributed to the changing age patterns. The increased use of NIV and HFNC may have influenced ICU admissions, especially in old patients. Despite the higher median age, the frequency of treatment limitations remained constant and thus probably did not affect mortality; however, of all patients who died, the majority (70.3%) had a documented treatment limitation.",
