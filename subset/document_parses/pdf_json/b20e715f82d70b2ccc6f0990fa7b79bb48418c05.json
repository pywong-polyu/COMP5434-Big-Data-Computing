To deconstruct the processes underlying disease progression and identify potential biomarkers, we used neuroimaging techniques with high translational potential to human clinical studies in the TgF344-AD rat model which recapitulates the full spectrum of Alzheimer's neuropathology (progressive amyloid deposition, tauopathy, frank neuronal loss, gliosis, and cognitive dysfunction). We employed longitudinal MRI and magnetic resonance spectroscopy in conjunction with behavioural testing to characterize multiple facets of disease pathology in male and female TgF344-AD rats (n = 26, 14M/12F) relative to wildtype littermates (n = 24, 12M/12F). Testing was performed at 4, 10, 16, and 18 months, covering much of the adult rat lifespan and multiple stages of disease progression. The TgF344-AD model demonstrated impaired spatial reference memory in the Barnes Maze by 4 months of age, followed by neurochemical abnormalities in the hippocampus by 10 months and major structural changes by 16 months. Specifically, TgF344-AD rats displayed increased total choline and lactate, and decreased total creatine, taurine, and N-acetylaspartate to myo-inositol ratio, dentate gyrus hypertrophy, and atrophy in the hippocampus, hypothalamus, and nucleus accumbens. Overall, these findings support the use of MRI and magnetic resonance spectroscopy for the development of non-invasive biomarkers of disease progression, clarify the timing of pathological feature presentation in this model, and contribute to the validation of the TgF344-AD rat as a highly relevant model for pre-clinical Alzheimer's disease research.",

            "text": "Early-stage disease characterization in transgenic animal models represents one promising avenue towards the development of new biomarkers and intervention approaches at a clinical level. The most common transgenic models are rodents expressing human genes harbouring mutations known to drive amyloid-\u03b2 accumulation and cause familial or early-onset Alzheimer's disease in humans, such as presenilin-1 (PS1), presenilin-2 (PS2), and amyloid precursor protein (APP). [5] [6] [7] Amyloid-\u03b2-overproducing rodents are considered 'gold standard' models but most do not display robust tauopathy or neuronal loss-two major hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease-unless additional human transgenes are expressed that are not associated with familial Alzheimer's disease (typically microtubule-associated protein tau, MAPT 7, 8 ) , as is the case with the widely used 3xTg mouse. 9 To date, one of the only rodent models to recapitulate the full spectrum of Alzheimer's disease neuropathology without insertion of a human tau transgene is the TgF344-AD rat which displays progressive amyloid-\u03b2 deposition, tauopathy, gliosis, neuronal loss, and cognitive impairment, despite only expressing mutant human APP (APPswe, KM670/671NL) and PS1 (\u0394E9) genes. 10 Not only does the TgF344-AD model represents a major advancement for Alzheimer's disease research, but the numerous advantages of studying rats over mice-they are physiologically and genetically closer to humans, display a richer behavioural phenotype, and have larger brains 11 -make the TgF344-AD rat a particularly salient option for pre-clinical biomarker development.",

[12] [13] [14] MRI studies have identified reduced cortical thickness and atrophy of the medial temporal lobe as prominent features of Alzheimer's disease in human subjects 13, 15 that may precede clinical diagnosis. 16, 17 Similar studies in transgenic models have replicated some of these findings. [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] Proton MRS studies in rodent models of Alzheimer's disease have identified altered metabolic profiles in the hippocampus, cingulate cortex, and frontal cortex, including reduced N-acetylaspartate (NAA) and glutamate (Glu), and increased myo-inositol (Ins), glutamine (Gln), and total choline (tCho). [23] [24] [25] [26] These changes parallel those observed in similarly affected brain regions in human Alzheimer's patients such as the posterior cingulate and occipital cortices, 27, 28 while also informing on physiological processes involved in disease pathogenesis, including neuronal viability, cell membrane turnover, antioxidant capacity, neuroinflammation, energy metabolism, and neurotransmission. 29, 30 Despite the relevance of MRI and MRS in Alzheimer's disease research, few studies have simultaneously examined the longitudinal progression of anatomical, neurochemical, and cognitive changes in either rodent models or humans. As such, a gap in knowledge exists regarding the relative timing of the appearance of these pathological features, limiting the understanding of disease stages and subsequent design of therapeutic approaches.",

A similar effect was seen when testing the percentage of time spent exploring holes within the target quadrant ( Fig. 4B (left) ).

Additionally, as shown in Fig. 4C (left) the rate of success versus failure in locating the escape hole was lower among Tg rats throughout the study, though this difference was not statistically significant. The number of holes searched and average speed were also measured during the probe trial to characterize level of exploration and mobility, respectively. As shown in Fig. 4D, E (left) , both metrics differed between WT and Tg rats, with Tgs searching fewer holes throughout the study and moving more slowly than their WT littermates.

            "text": "The TgF344-AD rat is unique in its manifestation of amyloid and tau pathology despite only expressing mutant APP and PS1, and therefore closely replicates human Alzheimer's disease. Thorough characterization of the manifestation and progression of physiological abnormalities-particularly those that can be measured non-invasively-comprising each disease stage in this rat model is required for designing effective therapeutic approaches. While other authors have characterized pathological features in this model, the majority of our neuroimaging findings are being reported for the first time and ours is the earliest assessment of cognitive function. This study also explores the intersecting influence of sex Beta + + + + + SE P-value Beta + + + + + SE P-value Beta + + + + + SE P-value Beta + + + + + SE P-value Beta + + + + + SE P-value Aqueduct 6.0 + 1. 8 and genotype on neuroimaging and behavioural markers, which is crucial for improving diagnostic methods and interventions given that Alzheimer's disease prevalence and manifestation can differ between men and women. 49 As determined via post-mortem histology studies, decreased brain volume detected via MRI is an accurate marker of Alzheimer's disease-related neurodegeneration that can be used to support a clinical diagnosis in humans. 13, 50, 51 Models of human disease progression indicate early tissue pathology and atrophy in the entorhinal cortex 52 and other regions that comprise the limbic system, particularly the hippocampus. 50, 53, 54 The TgF344-AD model does not demonstrate significant cortical atrophy by 18 months, but does recapitulate volume reductions in limbic structures, including the hippocampus, basal forebrain, fimbria, fornix, hypothalamus, and lateral septum. In opposition to dentate gyrus atrophy reported in human Alzheimer's disease, 15, 55 we observed hypertrophy in the TgF344-AD model, with significantly larger volume at 16 and 18 months in Tgs relative to WTs. This is not entirely unexpected given that Fischer 344 rats display increased dentate gyrus volume during normal aging, 56,57 and therefore further hypertrophy during Alzheimer's disease may represent a pathological feature, similar to how normal hippocampal atrophy with age is exacerbated in Alzheimer's disease. 58 Additional structures with significant atrophy were the nucleus accumbens, caudoputamen, and ventral pallidum, all of which display amyloid and tau pathology and structural changes in human Alzheimer's disease. 15, 54, 59 The only other structural MRI-based study in the TgF344-AD rat reported a lack of major structural differences, but this study used only female rats and therefore a direct comparison between their results and ours is not particularly meaningful. 60 Age-centred analyses revealed that while many structures atrophied faster in Tgs, this was occasionally preceded by hypertrophy. For example, Tg rats demonstrate larger caudoputamen, fimbria, and nucleus accumbens volumes until 10 months, and then smaller volumes at 16 and 18 months relative to WTs. Supporting these findings, a neuroimaging study in PS1 mutation carriers reported increased caudate volume in asymptomatic individuals but decreased volume in symptomatic individuals, 61 suggesting different processes underlie morphometric change at different stages of disease progression. Reactive neuronal hypertrophy in the hippocampal CA1 region has been shown in Alzheimer's disease subjects prior to symptom onset 62 supporting early regional volume increases, either as a cellular response to amyloid and tau deposition, or a compensatory process prior to degeneration of neurons and synapses. 63 Future work combining MRI-based volumetric analysis and design-based stereology, similar to studies in transgenic mice, 64,65 would help fill critical gaps in knowledge regarding mechanisms underlying pathological morphometric change in the TgF344-AD model.",

Betas are standardized and SE denotes the standard error of the beta estimate. Unadjusted P-values are shown, with bold font denoting P-values that were still significant after applying FDR correction at 5%. The number following each macromolecule denotes the frequency at which the peak is located. Asp/Glu, aspartate/glutamate; Cr + PCr, creatine + phosphocreatine; Glu + Gln, glutamate + glutamine; GPC + PCh, glycerophosphocholine + phosphocholine; GSH, glutathione; MM, macromolecule; NAA/Ins, N-acetylaspartate/myo-inositol; NAA, N-acetylaspartate; NAAG, N-acetylaspartylglutamate; PE, phosphoethanolamine. The mixed-effects model used to fit the data is represented by a line of best fit and 95% prediction interval (shaded). Significance symbols are shown for the linear age-by-genotype interaction term ( \u2021), and the main effect of genotype ( \u2020) at each time point as determined by age-centred models. The subscript denotes the age at which the genotype effect was significant. (B) A three-way interaction between age, genotype, and sex was also explored, with a 5% false discovery rate correction applied. A significant three-way interaction term is denoted by X. \u2022 denotes an effect significant at the P-value level but not after FDR correction. inositol lipid synthesis, a constituent of membrane lipids, and an osmolyte. 30, 70, 71 Decreased taurine in the TgF344-AD rat is in agreement with the literature supporting the role of taurine in neurite outgrowth, synaptogenesis, and synaptic transmission, 72 all of which are dysfunctional in Alzheimer's disease. 73 Other differences between Tg rats and WT controls included a lower Asp/Glu ratio, lower tCr, and higher Lac at 10 months of age. These differences suggest the TgF344-AD model replicates the well-documented phenomenon of altered bioenergetics in human Alzheimer's disease, 74, 75 specifically, disrupted excitatory neurotransmission and a shift towards non-oxidative energy metabolism. 29 These findings also indicate tCr should not be used as an internal reference in this model. Finally, our report of increased tCho is in agreement with studies in human Alzheimer's disease patients 27, 76, 77 and likely reflects increased cell membrane turnover (a feature characteristic of neuronal degeneration 78 ) and/or inflammation and astrocytosis. 30, 79 Overall, the neurochemical profile of the TgF344-AD rat closely replicates that of human patients and provides insight into numerous pathological processes, substantiating its application in Alzheimer's disease research. In particular, our findings build upon the study in TgF344-AD rats by Chaney et al., 66 by studying both male and female rats, characterizing additional metabolites, and through the inclusion of individual macromolecule peaks, which, while they did not differ between WT and TgF344-AD rats, inclusion of basis functions for these peaks as performed here has been shown to improve metabolite quantification. 80, 81 Deficits in hippocampus-dependent spatial learning and memory are among the earliest complaints in Alzheimer's disease subjects. [82] [83] [84] Previous studies indicate that 5-monthold TgF344-AD rats require more trials to learn a delayed non-match-to-sample task 85 and impaired reversal learning on the Morris Water Maze 86 and Barnes Maze 10 by 6 months. To test spatial navigation in our TgF344-AD rats, we used a shortened version of the Barnes Maze test 44 which detected impairment in 3xTg mice earlier than traditional protocols. 43 Fittingly, ours is the earliest report of cognitive disturbance in this model, with impairments in long-term spatial reference memory present by 4 months of age. We also noted genotypedependent differences in speed and number of holes searched, substantiating the choice to use speed-and motivationindependent measures rather than the frequently chosen escape latency or number of errors. 87, 88 Regarding the interaction between sex and genotype, Tg females demonstrated stronger pathological effects in several brain volumes and more cognitive decline than Tg males, whereas sex effects on metabolite concentration were also present but did not consistently impact Tg females. To our knowledge, we are the first group to examine the interaction between age, genotype, and sex on neuroimaging markers in this model. However, sex differences in the TgF344-AD rat exist in open field and buried food tasks 89 and the Morris Water Maze test, 90 and sex differences in neuroanatomy and hippocampal tissue chemistry during normal aging in the Fischer 344 rat have been reported. 32, 37 These findings generally recapitulate human Alzheimer's disease data. Sex-specific patterns of neurodegeneration exist in human patients 91, 92 and men frequently present with later and less severe cognitive deficits than women. 93, 94 There is also an established role for oestrogen in regulation of metabolic pathways affected by Alzheimer's disease such as Glc transport, aerobic glycolysis, and mitochondrial function. 73, 94, 95 While additional work is required to corroborate our findings, the TgF344-AD model appears to recapitulate known sex differences in several aspects of disease presentation.",

Profound cerebral microvascular and neuronal network dysfunction is present at 9 months, 98, 99 along with reduced antioxidant capacity, and increased reactive oxygen species and pro-inflammatory cytokines at 10 months. 100 Our report of neurochemical changes by 10 months is consistent with these previously described molecular events. At 13 months, TgF344-AD rats demonstrate deficits in hippocampal neuronal differentiation, migration, and survival, 101 and display significant tau pathology, neuronal damage, and cognitive impairment between 16 and 26 months. 10, 66, 102 Given that reduced synaptic density and neuronal loss are associated with MRI-detectable volume changes, 51,103 these reports of altered neurogenesis and neuronal damage may reflect some of the processes underlying the volumetric changes we report.",

In contrast, early cognitive impairment differs from disease progression in humans where cognitive complaints are among the last pathological features to manifest. Given numerous studies have validated the consistency with which this model mimics the spread of components of human Alzheimer's pathology, this difference in timing of cognitive dysfunction may reflect inconsistencies in how cognition is tested or presents in rodent models versus humans. Behavioural testing is also extremely variable and subjective. Neuroimaging is considerably more objective and less variable, thus providing a better powered, sensitive, accurate, and efficient means to characterize disease progression. To our knowledge, we are the first group to simultaneously characterize the timing of the manifestation of neuroanatomical, neurochemical, and cognitive abnormalities in the TgF344-AD rat, thus providing new information that can be used to define disease stages in this model.",

Given that most structures demonstrated volume change towards 16 months, a paradigm where brain volumes are quantified from midlife onwards may permit the use of a linear age term and provide more power to detect three-way interactions. Second, restrictions on facility access due to the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in fewer animals being tested and increased variation in testing dates at the final time point, as well as inconsistency in the time between staining and imaging during immunofluorescence experiments. While these inconsistencies were accounted for in the statistical modelling, this is likely to have increased the overall variation in the data, possibly masking or muting some of the effects at the final time point. Finally, the lack of histological analyses at early time points meant we were unable to determine if pathological changes in neuroimaging markers precede those at the cellular level in the TgF344-AD rat.
