            "text": "Most of the studies related to human mobility are focused on intra-country mobility. However, there are many scenarios (e.g., spreading diseases, migration) in which timely data on international commuters are vital. Mobile phones represent a unique opportunity to monitor international mobility flows in a timely manner and with proper spatial aggregation. This work proposes using roaming data generated by mobile phones to model incoming and outgoing international mobility. We use the gravity and radiation models to capture mobility flows before and during the introduction of non-pharmaceutical interventions. However, traditional models have some limitations: for instance, mobility restrictions are not explicitly captured and may play a crucial role. To overtake such limitations, we propose the COVID Gravity Model (CGM), namely an extension of the traditional gravity model that is tailored for the pandemic scenario. This proposed approach overtakes, in terms of accuracy, the traditional models by 126.9% for incoming mobility and by 63.9% when modeling outgoing mobility flows.",

In such cases, official statistics (e.g., air passenger data) have been widely used both to understand mobility trends and types of mobility of international travelers [12] [13] [14] , and in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic to investigate the effectiveness of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) such as international travel restrictions, to model the spreading of the disease, to measure the social and economic impact of COVID-19, and to analyze the spreading of new variants [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] . Also social-media data have been used as an alternative data source to estimate international migration [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] . However, the previously mentioned works rely on data sources with some intrinsic limitations. Social media suffer from self-selection biases. For example, some social media may be widely used by people of a certain age while not capturing other age bins. Official statistics are reliable and precise but report a limited amount of international commuters, usually those traveling with a specific mode of transport (e.g., air passengers). Moreover, statistics are generally published with significant delays. When dealing with some social issues, such as migration and disease diffusion, working with data sources that are not timely reported represents a considerable limitation.",

In particular, the gravity model assumes that flows of people are proportional to the population and the distance between origins and destinations. However, during the COVID-19 pandemic we should also consider that travel restrictions and travel bans play an important role. Indeed, if we suppose to have an origin and two different destinations with the same population and the same distance, by definition, the gravity model will output the same flow of people. However, the destinations may have different restrictions in place (e.g., quarantines, travel bans) and thus the flows may be significantly different. Therefore, we claim that capturing only distances and populations is not enough and that the restrictions should be explicitly taken into consideration.",

To this end, we measure the synchrony between the data of international air passengers and the one generated by mobile phone activities. For the scope of this study, we assume that the number of passengers from air traffic data is representative of incoming/outgoing international mobility in UK. UK's Home Office has recently opened a dataset containing statistics of air passengers' arrivals since the COVID-19 outbreak. 1 In particular, the dataset details the daily number of air passengers who arrived in UK from January 1st 2020 to July 31st 2020, obtained from the Advanced Passenger Information (API). The API data primarily relates to passengers coming to UK via the commercial aviation route. The data is aggregated by day and without considering the origin of the flows. For this reason, to compare the synchronicity of the time series, we aggregate the roaming data without considering the origin. In particular, for each country c \u2208 C, we indicate its relative flow to UK at time t as c t . Then, the aggregated flow at time t is a t = c\u2208C c t .

In both cases, we can spot the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic (e.g., suggestions against all but essential travels, travel bans, lockdown and other countermeasures that impacted international mobility) majority of international travelers arriving in UK before April 2020 were traveling by air, while for April and May 2020, the air passengers accounted for only 46% and 38% of international travelers going to UK. 2 Finally, as expected, by looking at the trends, we can see how international mobility was deeply affected, both in terms of incoming and outgoing international mobility, by the limitations imposed as a result of the spread of COVID-19. For instance, we can see how the three plots start to decrease as mobility restrictions were introduced. This information provides two important insights on (i) why the number of roaming devices is higher than the one of air passengers and (ii) why starting from the lockdown announced on the 23rd of March the two lines related to incoming mobility started to decrease differently.",

Finally, we have similar relative improvements for the gravity model with a power law decay both in the incoming and outgoing mobility modeling tasks. The results obtained can be useful in many scenarios and highlight some important suggestions. First of all, in pandemic times, modeling just the mobility flows is not enough and explicitly modeling the severity of non-pharmaceutical interventions and other policies of the origin and destination countries is fundamental. This is shown by the significant relative improvements obtained with CGM. For instance, by using CGM and explicitly modeling restrictions, policy makers can take more precise decisions based on a more accurate model. At the same time, given the strong relation between mobility and disease diffusion, CGM can help in better understanding how a disease circulates internationally.",

At this stage, we did not use any data fusion technique due to the fact that the available air traffic statistics have two significant limitations. First of all, UK's border control provides only the data for people arriving in the UK and there is no information about the people leaving the UK. Second, the data are not aggregated at country level (i.e., we do not know the origin of the travelers).

Existing solutions are the gravity model and the radiation model and fully rely on distance and population. In this study, we claim that focusing on population and distance is not enough. In particular, in the case of the gravity model, we can not fit the parameters to estimate the impact of populations and distances on the flows. For instance, the flows observed in the training set may be significantly biased according to the restrictions imposed by the origin country and the destination country (e.g., quarantine requirements, international travel restrictions). The estimation of parameters may be significantly affected by such biases and underestimated. The radiation model may partially overcome this limitation as it is parameter-free. However, clearly specify which are the (mobility) restrictions imposed in the various countries may be used to boost the performances. In the proposed solution, we use the Oxford Stringency Index as a proxy of the pandemic situation in origin and destination countries and also as a proxy of international travel restrictions. We have seen that by explicitly modeling the restrictions, the performances of the so-called COVID Gravity Model increase both for incoming and outgoing international mobility flows. Having a more realistic model of international travelers is fundamental to provide decision makers with more realistic simulations and estimations. Policy makers may use such insights for taking actions to contrast the diffusion of the disease or to implement policies for improving the well-being of international migrants. Also, the combination of CGM and the fine-grained spatial aggregations, we may have with mobile phone data, may also be used to better investigate many problems including the spreading of new variants of COVID-19, preferences and habits of international travelers and others. For instance, if we want to study how COVID-19 spread internationally (e.g., [20, 55] ), the availability of fine-grained mobile phone data may lead to more realistic estimations of international mobility flows, and thus more realistic simulations. Also, while the data sources adopted in most of the studies only allow to estimate the number of people traveling from a country to another, with mobile phone data it is also possible to investigate how international travelers move within a country with a variety of fine-grained spatial resolutions (e.g., antenna level). This may help in better understanding how a disease is diffused over a territory and to target more specific geographical areas with countermeasures.",

Tackling such challenges requires timely data with a proper spatial aggregation that roaming activities can provide. In this paper, we have proposed to use roaming network data to capture international mobility. Then, we use the gravity and radiation models to model international mobility. The incoming mobility is modeled better by a gravity model with an exponential decay both before and during the nonpharmaceutical interventions introduced for contrasting the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. Instead, the outgoing mobility is captured equally well by the various models before the mobility restrictions were introduced. On the other side, after the second week of March, the radiation model is the one that captures mobility better. However, by explicitly modeling the COVID-19 restrictions for the origin and destination countries, the COVID Gravity Model (CGM) outperforms all the other models both for the incoming (improvement up to 126.9%) and outgoing (improvement up to 63.9%) mobility scenarios. These findings may have significant impact on how we should model international mobility in times of crises and can help policy makers in taking more accurate decisions. As part of future works, we will evaluate CGM also at a national and sub-national scales.",
