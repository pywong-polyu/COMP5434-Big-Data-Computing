            "text": "In a cross-sectional study, impact of management in dairy farms on calf mortality rates and prevalence of rotavirus and Cryptosporidium parvum in feces of calves was investigated. Sixty-two commercial dairy herds in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, Germany, were stratified selected in 2019. We performed in-person interviews and fecal specimens in samples of all-female calves of age 7 up to 21 days. Management data were documented on farm level. A Multiscreen Ag-ELISA was performed to determine rotavirus and Cryptosporidium parvum. Associations between two calf mortality rates, detection of C. parvum and rotavirus, and predictors were examined with GLM models. In farms with routine vaccination against respiratory diseases, 31-days mortality rate was 4.2% +/-1.26 compared to 7.6% +/-0.97 (p = 0.040) on non-vaccinating farms. Six-months mortality was lower in farms that continued feeding milk to calves during periods of diarrhea compared to farms that did not (6.9% +/-0.8 vs. 12.4% +/-2.3). In case of a routine shifting of calves from the calving box into calf boxes less C. parvum was detected compared to an individual moving of calves (33.3% +/-2.6 vs. 19.6% +/-5.3; p = 0.024). Our model confirms a positive association between occurrence of aqueous feces and frequency of detection of C. parvum (45.4% +/-23.6 vs. 21.4% +/-18.7; p < 0.001). Frequency of detection of rotavirus was lower in farms that reported a defined amount of applicated colostrum per calf than in farms that presented a range of colostrum instead of a defined amount. This study indicates the potential for mitigation of risk factors for mortality in calves.",

Colostrum management is most important management factor in determining calf health and survival (Godden, Lombard & Woolums, 2019) . It is recommended that calves be fed 10% to 12% of their body weight (BW) of colostrum at first feeding (3-4 L for a Holstein calf; Godden et al., 2019) . Serum IgG levels in calves were determined to be significantly higher in calves fed 4 L of colostrum at 0 h and a further 2 L at 12 h (serum IgG = 31.1 g/L) compared with calves fed only 2 L of high-quality colostrum at 0 h and a further 2 L at 12 h (serum IgG = 23.5 g/L; Morin, McCoy & Hurley, 1997) . However, the absolute volume of colostrum could not be confirmed as a predictor in our investigation. A reduced intake of colostrum is a risk factor for higher severity of the disease caused by a rotavirus infection (Dhama et al., 2009 ).",

We asked for time intervals relating to the calving event. We are aware that this is a reflection of the condition of the respondent. Of course, these data cannot be compared with measured data. The farms referred to in this study provide the calves their first colostrum meal within 2 h after calving (21 farms, 33.9%), within 4 h after calving (31 farms, 50.0%), later than 4 h after calving (4 farms, 6.5%). Our interpretation of this data is: most farmers in our study have a good awareness of the importance of an early calving-associated application of the first colostrum meal. The design of our study does not allow an estimation of time intervals between the birth of calves and colostrum application, as well as IG supplementation on-farm and calf levels.",
