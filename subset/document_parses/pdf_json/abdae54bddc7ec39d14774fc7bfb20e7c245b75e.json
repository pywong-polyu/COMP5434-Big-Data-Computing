They have a common zoonotic origin, a similar transmission route, and worse clinical outcomes in older people and individuals with underlying health conditions. 4 5 Following infection, the humoral immune response can be evaluated with total antibodies, specific antibodies (IgA, IgM and IgG) and neutralising antibodies. Long-term immunity depends on the presence of sensitised memory B cells and CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, which are much more challenging to measure given the complex laboratory methods required.

[24] [25] [26] [27] Neutralising antibodies target the receptor-binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 protein S and prevent its interaction with the host ACE 2. 9 28-30 The quantification of neutralising antibodies makes it possible to define an immune threshold above which individuals are likely to be protected while below they are likely to be susceptible. 9 30-32 The viral neutralisation test is the gold standard for measuring neutralising antibodies. This test can be done with a functional infectivity assay, such as the plaque reduction neutralisation test. 30 33 Pseudoviral vectors are being introduced for anti-S neutralising antibody assays in biosafety level 2 laboratories to avoid the live virus test that requires a level 3 facility. 9 29-31 Additionally, commercial enzyme immunoassays or chemiluminescent immunoassays have been introduced that determine the serum neutralising activity directed to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. 9 32 34 35 While these tests are useful for assessing the humoral immune response to infection or vaccination, correlations of protection need to be established. Neutralising antibodies have been isolated in 99% of individuals previously infected with SARS-CoV-2, 10 and it is postulated that their presence would correlate strongly with protection against infection and reinfection in individuals with no history of COVID-19 but who have been previously vaccinated. 9 19 28 33 36-38 The duration of immunity to SARS-CoV-2, whether acquired by disease or vaccination, is also under study. Most people have levels of IgG and neutralising antibodies that are detectable for at least 6 months after infection, 7 38 49-55 Different publications have shown that a higher cardiovascular risk from conditions such as arterial hypertension, 4 56-58 diabetes, 57-61 dyslipidaemia, 59 heart failure 58 62 63 and coronary heart disease 56 57 62 64 65 is associated with a higher risk of severe COVID-19 and death.",

First, at the time of grant proposal writing, which still holds true, the seroprevalence rates were irregular and strongly dependent on pandemic waves and country vaccination campaign characteristics such as timing, number of doses and products being rolled out. Second, the available funds for this project were capped at a sum that made it impossible to increase the sample size further. Notwithstanding the former considerations, we believe that this sample size will allow us to estimate seroprevalence with good precision. According to the Unity Studies of the WHO, 71 a sample of 300 has an expected margin of error of 4%. Similarly, we calculate a margin of error of 1% with a sample of 1000 at an expected seroprevalence of 3% and a confidence level of 95%.",

For the principal analysis, we will provide: -Graphic and descriptive statistics of the observed changes in serum neutralising antibody levels for the different exposed groups, at different time points (calendar time for all participants, and timeto-event for participants who experienced an exposure event: vaccination or COVID-19). -Rates of antibody decline (or half-life, if possible) estimated using a longitudinal mixed-effects model. The 95% CIs and IQRs will be calculated for the estimated rates. The fixed-effects model will consider age, gender, smoke habits and cardiovascular risk factors. 4. For the secondary analysis, we will estimate: -Incident COVID-19 clinical events occurring during the study analysed by severity and other clinical and epidemiological features, along with neutralising antibody levels measured at 3-4 weeks after the COVID-19 event. -Vaccine exposure events occurring during the study will be tabulated and analysed by type of vaccine and other clinical and epidemiological features, along with neutralising antibody levels measured close to the time of vaccine administration. -Other post hoc analyses may be performed driven by the concurrent pandemic developments. 5. When applicable, missing data regarding key variables will be reported and handled by appropriate statistical imputation methods. Diagnostic checks of model assumptions will be done and reported as supplemental material.",

The immunisation of populations with different types of vaccines has been ongoing for a year in some countries or at a bare minimum in other countries. Many decisions are still made based on incomplete, short-term evidence or evidence that changes over the months, which is understandable and unavoidable; however, prospective cohort studies are needed to answer questions that can only be addressed with longitudinal designs. This project focuses on an essential tool for epidemiological surveillance of COVID-19, which is the presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in the community.",

It is also one of the countries with the most significant vaccine coverage. As of writing, 87% of the population has been fully vaccinated, and 61% boosted. As of 5 December 2021, Chile has authorised the following vaccines: BNT162b2/Pfizer-BioNTech, CoronaVac/Sinovac, AZD1222/Oxford-AstraZeneca, Ad5-nCoV/CanSino, Ad26.COV2.S/Janssen and GAM-COVID-VAC/Gamaleya. The COmmunity Cohort Study will allow us to: 1. Know the seroprevalence of neutralising antibodies in the same population of individuals with greater precision and at different time points. 2. Ascertain the proportion of unvaccinated and vaccinated individuals, including primary scheme and booster doses, including length of time since last exposure. 3. Estimate the seroconversion rate of initially seronegative patients at 1 year of follow-up. 4. Know the incidence of COVID-19 in this risk group, regardless of vaccination status. After establishing the baseline seroprevalence, we will prospectively capture all COVID-19 clinical events and their outcomes. 5. Better understand the strength and duration of neutralising antibodies in vaccinated individuals or those with symptomatic COVID-19. These results will be a reliable evidence base for decision-making on various issues, such as modelling epidemic waves and needs for vaccination and testing. The results will also be relevant when considering whether to relax SARS-CoV-2 transmission control measures.",
