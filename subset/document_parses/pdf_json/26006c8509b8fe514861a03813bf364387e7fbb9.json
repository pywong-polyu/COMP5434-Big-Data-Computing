The present study aimed to assess sleep quality and its associated factors among community non-medical anti-epidemic workers. Method: A survey was conducted using anonymous online questionnaire to collect information from 16 March 2020 to 24 March 2020. A total of 474 participants were included, with a 94.23% completion rate. The questionnaire contained demographic data, physical symptoms, and contact history with COVID-19. The researchers assessed perceived social support by the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS), assessed perceived stress by the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), and measured sleep quality by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) questionnaire. Results: Among the participants, 46.20% reported poor sleep quality. A binary logistic regression revealed that having educational background of junior college or above, being a member of the police force, having contacted individuals with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 infection, having chronic disease(s), having illness within 2 weeks, and having high or moderate perceived stress were significant factors associated with an increased risk of poor sleep quality. Conclusion: Demographic factors, physical symptoms, history of contact with COVID-19, and perceived stress are significantly associated with poor sleep quality of community non-medical anti-epidemic workers. Thus, targeting these factors might be helpful in enhancing sleep quality of community workers.",

The community anti-epidemic workers, both medical and non-medical workers, have played an important role in the community-based prevention of COVID-19 in China. The non-medical workers mainly participated in \"population mobility control\" and \"community digital management\". For example, the workers collected basic information about residents in a door-to-door way, shifted patients with restrictions on the access to each community, and delivered living supplies to residents who were home-quarantined [3, 4] . However, in accordance with the reports on anti-epidemic nurses during COVID-19 and MERS-CoV [5, 6] , continuous working under stressful circumstances for many hours and managing potential health risks could have a major influence on the mental health and sleep quality of non-medical anti-epidemic workers [7] .",

Sleep is an important determinant of health, and it is essential for the maintenance of physical and mental health [9] . Sleep disturbance can lead to poor concentration and finances [10] and may increase individuals' morbidity and mortality [11] .

(2) Contact with an individual with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 infection. (3) Health-related factors, including chronic disease and illness within 2 weeks. Chronic disease was evaluated through the participant's response (\"yes\" or \"no\") to the question \"if you have been diagnosed with diabetes, hypertension, heart disease, arthritis, migraine, asthma, thyroid disease, heart disease, thrombosis, bronchitis/emphysema, osteoporosis, cancer, stomach/peptic ulcer, cerebrovascular disease or other major physical diseases\", which was similar to what Scott described in a previous study [16] . The present researchers defined illness within 2 weeks as acute sickness lasting for the past 2 weeks. (4) Perceived social support, measured by the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS), which was developed by Zimet et al. in 1990 [17] . The MSPSS scale comprised of 12 items, which are rated on a seven-point scale (1 = very strongly disagree, 7 = very strongly agree). The total perceived social support score was obtained by summing the responses to each item, and a total MSPSS score < 32 indicated serious perceived social support problems, a score \u2265 32 and < 50 indicated some perceived social support problems, and a score > 50 indicated no perceived social support problem. The Chinese version of the MSPSS has demonstrated good reliability and validity [18] . (5) Perceived stress, measured by the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), which was developed by Cohen et al. in 1983 [19] . The PSS scale comprised of 10 items with a five-point rating scale (0 = never, 4 = always), and the total score of PSS ranged from 0 to 40. A total PSS score > 19 indicated high perceived stress, a total score > 13 and \u2264 19 indicated moderate perceived stress, and a total score \u2264 13 indicated low perceived stress. Previous researchers had examined the Chinese version of the PSS and documented favorable results [20] . (6) Sleep quality, measured by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) questionnaire, which was developed by Buysse et al. in 1989 [21] . The PSQI scale comprised of seven dimensions: subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, habitual sleep efficiency, sleep disturbance, use of sleep medication, and daytime dysfunction. Each dimension was scored on a scale from 0 to 3, with a total score ranging from 0 to 21. The Chinese version of the PSQI has good reliability and validity in the Chinese population [22] . According to a previous study [21] , a total PSQI score \u2264 5 indicated good sleep quality, and a total score > 5 indicated poor sleep quality.",

A majority of participants did not report a problem with social support (83.76%). Almost half of the participants (48.95%) perceived their stress level as low. Furthermore, the percentage of participants who had contact with the individuals with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 infection was only 16.24%. About a quarter of the participants had one or more chronic diseases (25.53%). Less than a third of the participants had an illness within 2 weeks (28.06%) ( Table 1) .",

Moreover, the members of the police force were more likely to report poor sleep quality than volunteers. This finding is different from the based on a general population of Italian participants in a previous study [25] . A possible reason for this discrepancy is that the participants whose educational background was junior college or above and those who were members of the police force always undertake more anti-epidemic duties in the community during the COVID-19 epidemic, which would increase their negative emotions and stress, resulting in poor sleep quality. The present results suggested that participants who had contact with individuals with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 infection were more likely to report poor sleep quality. COVID-19 could transmit from human to human among close contacts [13] . Thus, contact with individuals with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 infection would obviously increase the risk of infection and psychological pressures [26] , which leads to psychological problems and poor sleep quality. In terms of health status, the present researchers found that chronic disease and illness within 2 weeks were associated with poor sleep quality, which is similar to the findings from previous studies based on general populations [27, 28] . Chronic disease and illness within 2 weeks would definitely affect an individual's quality of life, which has a close correlation with sleep quality [29] .",
