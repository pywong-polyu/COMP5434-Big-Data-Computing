Methods: A retrospective, comparative study included 100 patients who had recovered from COVID-19 and 100 controls who were recruited by stratified randomization from hospital registration system and analyzed regarding history, full ophthalmological examination, general examination including internal medicine and neurological evaluation. Laboratory tests were done. Results: Mean\u00b1SD of age were 55.5 \u00b1 6.2 in COVID group vs 56.5 \u00b1 5.8 in control group; P value = 0.7. In COVID group, 57 patients (57%) were males vs 51 patients (51%) in control group (P value = 0.39), the other compared parameters including history and risk factors showed non-significant difference except for ESR and D-dimer which were elevated in COVID group. In COVID group, 5 patients (5%) were having retinal vascular occlusion, 2 patients (2%) were having anterior ischemic optic neuropathy AION, 3 patients (3%) were having uveitis and 2 patients (2%) were having central serous chorioretinopathy CSCR. While in control group, 2 patients (2%) were having retinal vascular occlusion, and none had AION, uveitis or CSCR (P value = 0.006). Conclusion: Post-acute COVID-19 syndrome could affect the eyes in the form of coagulation problems, neurological morbidities, and other manifestations. This necessitates meticulous follow-up of recovered patients from COVID-19.",

            "text": "Since the emergence of the coronavirus in Wuhan china in 2019 many studies have predicted its ocular manifestations including follicular conjunctivitis, subconjunctival hemorrhage, redness, and eye dryness. Exposure keratitis and mucopurulent conjunctivitis (MPC) were found especially in patients admitted to intensive care units which could be due to the exposure of open mask oxygen or eye exposure. Ocular manifestations could be the first symptoms to appear in some infected patients. [1] [2] [3] A new term emerged as a result of lockdown (Quarantine Dry Eye) which was attributed to personal behavior in both developed and developing countries, this necessitates the change in the treatment and follow-up modalities of those patients. 4 The appearance of ocular manifestations, drive the ophthalmologists to give medications in the form of eye drops, Some of them have antiviral activities and their use could raise confusion to the physicians as they could affect the level of the virus in the conjunctival tears and secretions. 5 The presence of the virus in the conjunctival tears and secretions revealed the possibility of its transmission through ocular secretions and could explain the deaths amongst ophthalmologists. Also many researches estimated the immune response to the virus in the eye by estimating immunoglobulin (A IgA). [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] Even with no conjunctival manifestations, the virus could be found in the tears enforcing the need of safety measures during ophthalmology practice which could by using protective goggles, social distances in clinics, and even full personal protective equipment (PPE). Some studies evaluated the safe ophthalmology practice amongst ophthalmologists which was different according to safety protocols in the hospitals or the country protocols. [14] [15] [16] It was a surprise to talk about post-acute COVID-19 syndrome or long COVID syndrome, which was defined by National Institute of Health (NIH), Center of Disease Control (CDC), and the World Health Organization (WHO). It means the presence or appearance of long term effects of coronavirus on different body systems. 17 It is described as causing general fatigue, respiratory, cardiac, or psychological manifestations. The eye could also be affected in post-acute COVID-19 syndrome and some reports have suggested this, but multicenter or worldwide studies are still deficient. [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] In this study we aim to evaluate the ocular manifestations of post-acute COVID-19 or long COVID syndrome in Upper Egypt.",
