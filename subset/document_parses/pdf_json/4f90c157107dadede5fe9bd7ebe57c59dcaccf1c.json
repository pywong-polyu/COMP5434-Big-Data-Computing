India's first coronavirus case was detected on 10 January 2020 in Kerala (Narasimhan, 2020) . Since then, the disease is showing an increasing trend. As of 23 September 2020, India has recorded 5.65 million positive cases with 90.020 mortalities (Home, n.d.) . Because the virus is novel to human beings, and there is no vaccine yet available, every individual is susceptible and can become infected. Healthcare workers are at high risk, and unfortunately, more than 3000 healthcare workers in China have been infected. Anesthesiologists are among healthcare workers who are at an even higher risk of becoming infected because of their close contact with infected patients and high potential of exposure to respiratory droplets or aerosol from their patients' airways.",
