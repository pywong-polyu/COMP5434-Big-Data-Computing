However, Italy, which located in Europe, is in a serious stage of epidemic spread. Fundamentally, due to the long incubation period of the virus, the difficulty in identifying symptoms, negligence in the prevention and control of returnees, and the relatively low number of sick people, Italy and the whole of Europe have not been highly vigilant, which has brought an opportunity for the spread of the virus [1] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 692, "end": 695, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Various mathematical models are being used to conduct a variety of studies to analyze and predict the evolution of this epidemic.

Reference [3] used the least square method of SEIR partitioning and Poisson noise to estimate the basic reproduction number of COVID-19 in Japan as R0 = 2.6 (95% CI, 2.4-2.8). The experimental results show that the epidemic of COVID-19 in Japan will not end quickly, and it is ridiculous to think that COVID-19 will disappear in summer spontaneously. The traditional epidemic model (SEIR) involves various factors and analyses, which may subject to potential bias. Therefore, it is necessary to propose a COVID-19 prediction model based on time series.
