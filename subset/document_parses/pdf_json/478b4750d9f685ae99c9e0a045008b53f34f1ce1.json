However, the longevity of the protective immune response and its efficacy against emerging variants remains to be determined. To improve longevity and future protection against variants, we have designed a DNA vaccine encoding both the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) and its nucleocapsid (N) protein, the latter of which is highly conserved amongst beta coronaviruses. The vaccine elicits strong proinflammatory CD4 Th1 and CD8 T-cell responses to both proteins, with these responses being significantly enhanced by fusing the nucleocapsid sequence to a modified Fc domain.",

            "text": "The current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has prompted a global response with researchers from hundreds of institutions across the world developing and testing potential vaccine candidates that can prevent infection and COVID-19 disease. SARS-CoV-2 is known to facilitate host cell entry by targeting the cellular receptor, ACE2 using its densely-glycosylated spike (S) protein. The S protein is a trimeric class I fusion protein which undergoes several structural rearrangements and cleavage events to eventually fuse the viral and host membranes [1, 2] , a process triggered by S1 subunit binding to the host cell receptor ACE2 via its receptor binding domain (RBD). The virus targets the airway epithelial cells, alveolar epithelial cells, vascular endothelial cells and macrophages in the lung, all of which express ACE2 [3, 4] . Viral assembly inside the host cell requires four structural proteins, the S, matrix (M), envelope (E), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins. Homotrimers of the S protein make up the receptor-binding spikes on the viral surface [5, 6] . The N protein contains two domains that each bind the viral genome, packaging it into virions [11] [12] [13] . SARS-CoV-2 has a singlestranded positive sense RNA genome and the coronavirus family have the largest genomes in this category of viruses, encoding RNA processing and editing enzymes which increase the fidelity of replication. However, variation arises through a high rate of homologous recombination. Although SARS-CoV-2 can cause severe symptoms and death in the elderly or clinically vulnerable populations, the fact that approximately 80% of infected individuals present with no symptoms or mild infection [14] suggests that effective immunity can control the infection.",

Although, the S protein is also a key target for T cell responses, responses have also been detected against the M, E and N proteins and several other non-structural proteins [16] . The currently approved SARS-CoV-2 vaccines and most of those under development predominantly aim to stimulate neutralising antibody responses against the S protein to block the virus binding to ACE2 receptor and entering cells. However, viral evolution has created numerous mutations in the S protein that not only have increased infectivity but have also reduced the efficacy of neutralising antibodies that have been raised to previously encountered viruses [17] [18] [19] [20] . The N protein plays a vital role in viral RNA replication and the formation of new virions and is therefore highly conserved between coronaviruses [4, 21] . It is present in large quantities and can stimulate a strong immune response. Critically, most survivors of SARS-CoV-2 show evidence of T cell and antibody immunity against the N protein [22] , suggesting that it is a target of the natural immune response. Our vaccine design includes the N protein in order to provide broader immunity during the ongoing viral pandemic, a strategy also being considered by other next generation vaccine developers [23] .",

The DNA vector enables direct presentation of the encoded epitopes in antigen presenting cells (APCs) as well as cross presentation of secreted Fc-fused proteins to dendritic cells via high affinity Fc\u03b3R1 receptor (CD64) binding. This DNA vaccine platform has been successfully used in the clinic as a cancer immunotherapeutic, where it has shown to induce vaccinespecific T-cell responses in patients with melanoma and was compatible with a prime and multiple boosts dosing regimen [27] .

A strong T cell response is not only essential for the generation of humoral immunity in coronavirus infection [41] but has also been shown to persist over time and is therefore likely to be important for long term protection [22, 42] . Grifoni et al. have indeed shown the importance of both T cell and humoral immunity to S and N proteins for SARS-CoV-2 protection [16] . Evidence from SARS-CoV demonstrates the persistence of T cell responses to both S and N proteins up to 11 years post infection [42] . In addition, studies in mouse models of SARS-CoV have shown that memory CD8 T cells provide efficient protection from SARS-CoV infection [43] . Therefore, to be most effective, immunity stimulated by vaccination will likely need to comprise of both potent virus-specific CD8 and CD4 T cell responses as well as neutralising antibody responses. Several reports using murine models indicate that a strong Th1 response alongside virus specific CD8 response and virus specific neutralising antibodies are necessary for successful control of SARS-CoV and MERS [44, 45] . Although it is too early to determine the full extent of longevity of the T-cell responses for SARS-CoV-2 in humans, infection-specific memory T cells have been detected in convalescent patients and responses can be detected up to 18 weeks after infection.",

In this study, these titres were higher than those elicited by a DNA vaccine encoding whole S protein, which was also reflected in the ACE2 binding inhibition assay, suggesting that vaccination with RBD may elicit higher neutralising antibody titres than vaccination with the complete S antigen. These data compare favourably with other studies in which the whole S protein or an RBD trimer have been used to produce vaccine candidates that generate potent neutralising antibodies [23, [49] [50] [51] [52] . Indeed, it has been demonstrated that the majority of the neutralising antibodies to S protein target the RBD, supporting the inclusion of just the RBD sequence in this bivalent vaccine [53] .",

No significant difference was seen between the trimer variants (SupplementaryFigure 1). The N protein secretion levels were overall much lower than the RBD secretion, with the N protein producing more secreted protein than the Fc and Fc iV1 N protein constructs (Figure 1Bii). Unlike antibody responses, the stimulation of a T cell response is not reliant on secreted protein, because of which protein was also measured in cell lysates to determine if protein was made but not secreted. Cells transfected with the construct expressing the RBD monomer showed the highest level of RBD protein in the cell lysates (Figure 1Ci). A similar observation was seen for the N protein with highest levels in the cell lysate transfected with the construct expressing the non-fused N protein(Figure 1Cii).Collectively, the results suggest that functional RBD and N protein are produced as both secreted and intracellular forms, which can stimulate both T-cell and antibody responses.Linkage of N protein to modified Fc stimulates superior N specific T cell responsesT cell responses in mice following immunisations with vaccine constructs containing the N monomer, monomer linked to Fc or modified Fc (iV1) were evaluated using RBD and N protein overlapping peptide pools.

The variant vaccines induced higher titres to both the original Lineage A S1 and B.1.351 (Beta) S1 proteins compared to responses induced by the whole S DNA vaccine (EC 50 of 1389 and 644 respectively). The sera were also assessed in a similar antibody binding assay on the MesoScale Discovery platform that includes the whole spike and RBD proteins from original Lineage A, B.1.351 (Beta), B.1.1.7 (Alpha) and P.1 (Gamma) variants (Supplementary where the same pattern of responses was observed. Sera from immunised mice showed similar reactivity to either the original Lineage A and B.1.1.7 (Alpha) variants or the B.1.351 (Beta) and P.1 (Gamma) variants, as might be expected based on their RBD mutations. Interestingly, the sera from mice vaccinated with the original Lineage A vaccine and the B.1.351 (Beta) variant vaccine showed similar titres of antibodies recognising the Lineage A N protein and a N protein variant containing the D3L, R203K, G204R and S235F mutations, two of which are also found in the B.1.1.7 (Alpha) variant (Supplementary Figure 3), suggesting perhaps that N protein specific antibodies may be more cross-reactive or bind to conserved regions of the N protein. The ability of sera from immunised mice to inhibit the binding of the ACE2 receptor to the variant RBD or whole S proteins was assessed using the MesoScale Discovery platform. Inhibition of RBD binding to ACE2 was higher for sera from mice vaccinated with the original Lineage A vaccine construct and the B.1.351 (Beta) variant vaccine construct compared to that seen with the NIBSC 20/136 control (Figure 6Ci). In contrast, sera from mice immunised with whole S DNA showed a lower capacity to inhibit ACE2 binding which was similar to that of the NIBSC 20/136 control. Sera from mice immunised with the original Lineage A vaccine construct inhibited 80-100% of ACE2 binding to the original Lineage A RBD and B.1.1.7 (Alpha) variants with a drop to 50-60% against the B.1.351 (Beta) and P.Gamma) RBD variants. The reverse is seen in sera from mice immunised with the B.1.Beta) variant vaccine. Despite a reduction in the inhibition of ACE2 binding to the B.1.Beta) and P.1 (Gamma) RBD variants, the inhibition levels remain above those seen using sera from whole S DNA immunised mice. A similar trend is seen in the ACE2 receptor binding inhibition assay with the variant whole S proteins (Figure 6Cii). Sera from mice immunised with the original Lineage A or B.1.351 (Beta) variant vaccines were also assessed in pseudotype and live virus neutralisation tests against the original Lineage A and B.1.351 (Beta) variants. Sera from mice immunised with the original variant vaccine showed potent neutralisation of the original Lineage A pseudotype, with reduced efficacy against the B.1.351 (Beta) variant vaccine (ID 50 values of 6232 and 2137 respectively) (Figure 6D). Sera from mice immunised with either vaccine showed neutralisation of the B.1.351 (Beta) pseudotype variant, but little difference was noted (ID 50 values of 948 and 997, respectively). In the live virus neutralisation assay sera from mice immunised with either the original Lineage A or the B.1.351 (Beta) variant vaccines neutralised of the original Lineage A virus with ID 50 values of 4964 and 1334 respectively and both are better than NIBSC controls (Figure 6E). In contrast to the antibody responses, the T cell responses did not seem to be impacted by variations between the virus strains (Figure 6F). Splenocytes from mice immunised with either the original Lineage A vaccine or the B.1.351 (Beta) vaccine were stimulated ex vivo with RBD and N peptide pools derived from the original sequence. T cell responses specific for RBD and N were detected with little difference between the response induced by the different vaccine constructs. These results suggest that mutations in the B.1.351 (Beta) variant have less impact on the T cell responses. Discussion We describe the development of a DNA vectored vaccine targeting both S and N proteins of SARS-CoV-2. In this study, we have demonstrated that the vaccine induces CD4 and CD8 T cell responses to both N and RBD proteins in addition to eliciting potent neutralising antibody responses. We have shown the stimulation of N and RBD peptide specific T cell responses in several mouse strains, demonstrating that peptides derived from N and RBD can be presented via various HLA alleles, thereby indicating the broad application of this vaccine in populations possessing a diverse range of HLA alleles. In responding immunised mice T cells released IFN\u03b3 and TNF\u03b1 upon stimulation in vitro, two Th1 cytokines required to induce potent immune responses, with the absence of IL-10 and IL-4 that could potentially induce damaging Th2 responses. Strong T cell immune responses were induced by vaccines based on the original Lineage A SARS-CoV-2 isolate and the B.1.351 (Beta)variant, suggesting that the mutations may not be as significant for evading T cell responses as they are for antibody responses.

            "text": "Additionally, recent reports using lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) as a model virus suggest an alternative mechanism for the beneficial effect of N protein specific antibodies which involves the stimulation of antibody-dependent intracellular neutralisation and promotion of N specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) that efficiently clear virus infected cells [57]. The study by Caddy et al. suggests that N-specific antibodies can bind N protein either released during viral lysis or expressed on the surface of infected cells and that the immune complex can be taken up by APCs, in which TRIM21 targets N protein for cytosolic degradation and the generation of cytotoxic T cells against N peptides. This is a rapid response and mediates viral clearance prior to the establishment of neutralising antibodies. In support of this hypothesis the vaccine construct containing N protein fused to the modified Fc sequence induced significantly better T-cell responses to N protein and also elicited higher responses to RBD than a similar construct expressing the same RBD construct but with unmodified Fc linked to N (data not shown). This suggests that the modified N-Fc fusion is acting as an adjuvant and activating APCs to also enhance the T-cell response to other antigens. It is therefore possible that SARS-CoV-2 N specific antibodies could play a role in viral clearance and protection. A recent report by Matchett et al. has demonstrated the protective ability of an adenovirus type-5 (Ad5)-vectored vaccine encoding N protein from SARS-CoV-2 in murine and hamster infection models and shows that protection is associated with the rapid stimulation of N protein specific T cell responses [58], thereby providing further evidence for the important role of N protein specific T cell responses. However, any evidence of N protein specific antibody response was not described. Reports by Rice et al and Seiling et al have also demonstrated the benefit of combining both S and N proteins as vaccine targets",

            "text": "encoding the original Lineage A RBD sequence. However, these responses remain superior to those seen in the sera from mice immunised with whole S encoding DNA. Encouragingly, these antibody responses showed a similar binding titre in ELISA and ACE2 binding inhibition with the B.1.1.7 (Alpha) variant S protein suggesting that mutations in the B.1.1.7 (Alpha)variant S protein do not reduce the antibody response induced by the DNA vaccine encoding the original Lineage A RBD sequence. We have also demonstrated the efficacy of a vaccine construct encoding the B.1.351 (Beta) variant RBD sequence and show high titre antibody responses to the B.1.351 (Beta) variant S protein that also cross react with the original Lineage A S protein. Recent reports in the literature suggest that sera from patients with the B.1.351 (Beta) variant of SARS-CoV-2 have high titre cross neutralising antibodies that also recognise the original SARS-CoV-2 virus [65]. In this report we demonstrate that although sera from mice immunised with the vaccine encoding the B.1.351 (Beta) variant RBD show a reduction in ACE2 binding inhibition of the Lineage A and B.1.1.7 (Alpha) variants, responses remain similar to those in sera from whole S DNA immunised mice and remain above 50% inhibition against all variants tested. Interestingly, in pseudotype and live virus neutralisation assays there is less difference between the sera from the original Lineage A and B.1.351 (Beta) vaccinated mice with strong neutralisation of the Lineage A variant from mice immunised with either vaccine showing ID 50 titres of >1000. It is possible that this reflects a polyclonal antibody response against both S and N proteins. Although a decrease in neutralisation of the B.1.351 (Beta) variant is seen for both vaccines, neutralisation titres are consistent with the current vaccines targeting S protein only [53, 66]. Despite this, these data imply that there is evidence of cross-reactivity and use of a vaccine encoding the B.1.351 (Beta) variant sequences may provide additional protection against multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants.In summary, DNA provides a cost effective and rapid to manufacture product that can be easily adapted to encode sequences or mutations present in new variants. DNA vectors also lend themselves well to use in multiple homologous prime boost immunisation regimes, which is often not compatible with other viral vector-based vaccination strategies due to limitations of anti-vector immunity but may be vital to combat rapidly emerging virus variants.Data from our cancer vaccine platform demonstrates the stability of the DNA vector used in this study and its safety in human subjects[27]. The bivalent DNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccine stimulates strong humoral and cellular immunity that can be easily adapted to emerging virus variants. Furthermore, the responses elicited by both original Lineage A and B.1.351 (Beta) variant vaccines show cross-reactivity with multiple viral variants and support the potential clinical application of these vaccines.
