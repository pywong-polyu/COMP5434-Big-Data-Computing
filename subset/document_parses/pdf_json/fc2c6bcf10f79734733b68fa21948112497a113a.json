During the 1990s and early 2000s, strong empirical evidence is available to support the fact that even though income disparity among countries has somewhat declined (Sala-i- Martin, 2006 ), this has not happened within countries and the gap between the poorer regions and ones with higher income has increased even further. Global development has been accompanied by a paradoxically parallel status, Abstract Lagging-behind regions, as an example of the failure of convergence in a country, has attracted the attention of many researchers who are attempting to adopt applicable policies and strategies to overcome the problem of low growth paths. The present study focuses on the policy proposals in the context of new economic geography and evolutionary economic geography for lagging-behind areas. Industrial agglomeration, as an essential element of the new economic geography, has restricted the potential for policy-making in lagging-behind regions. Creating regional advantages, as a policy in evolutionary economic geography, has provided diversified policy options for lagging-behind regions. However, this approach faces multi-level challenges in laggingbehind regions, including the lack of critical mass about low diversity and the gap in the knowledge base between lagging-behind and affluent areas. Therefore, if this policy is to be the basis for creating regional objectives, it should provide a structure for simulating external knowledge links and distinguishing the nature of the various related industries. namely, \"The Great Convergence\" between countries (Baldwin, 2016) and at the same time \"The Great Divergence\" within countries (Moretti, 2012) among several industrialized economies.",

Attention to regional development strategy was revisited during the global financial crisis in 2008, and policymakers began to think of the most appropriate ways to boost growth and development. The main reason comes from the fact that during the second half of the 20 s, non-core regions began to account for an increasing share of economic growth across Europe and many OECD countries [ (Stefanou, 2014) ; (Dijkstra, 2013) ]. A wide range of major international organizations in recent years also put the spotlight on the underlying rationale, the functions, and the intended consequence of local and regional development strategies WorldBank (2009); European-Commission (2017); OECDb (2018). Re-addressing this issue has led to more sophisticated regional policy-making strategies from simple core-periphery stories to the idea of sustainable and inclusive regional growth in the EU (McCann & Ortega-Argil\u00e9s, 2015) , place-based regional policy in both developed (D\u0105browski, 2014) and developing countries (Shenoy, 2018) , and place-sensitive (Iammarino et al., 2018) policies.",

The idea is that congestion and high cost of production factors in large and wealthy regions along with perfect competition and factor mobility yield constant or decreasing return to scale which as a consequence provide diffusion of prosperity and convergence in the real regional income or means of spatial equilibrium (Glaeser, 2008) . This interpretation was rejected by both New Economic Geography (NEG) and Evolutionary Economic Geography (EEG). Instead, they argue that agglomeration forces can be a dominant equilibrium in economic geography. However, NEG and EEG differ in their approaches and policy recommendations; for example, the NEG theory is more interested in space-neutral approaches while EEG tends to consider space as an important factor in regional development prescriptions.",

To do so, the investment resources for infrastructures such as transportation systems were provided to help underperformed areas to increase physical accessibility to more prosperous areas (Varga, 2017) . Beginning in the 1980s onwards, the drawbacks of this viewpoint in regional development were revealed when the emphasis on physical investment gave way to the importance of regional entrepreneurial activities, education, R&D, and knowledge-intensive economy. The underlying idea was that such policies contribute to regional convergence in two main ways. First, they enhance economic efficiency by focusing on maximizing agglomeration, and secondly, such policies counteract the negative impacts of agglomeration. The latter contribution is achieved by helping people become skilled or entrepreneurial as well as by ensuring the geographical mobility of labor and knowledge diffusion (Iammarino et al., 2018) .",

In other words, policy should focus on selecting some areas to be dynamic in terms of economic performance and then ensuring that people have access to opportunities in these areas (Rodr\u00edguez-Pose, 2018) . Not surprisingly, these approaches not only have limited success in reducing regional disparities but are based on the view that regional disparities are necessary and inevitable for overall economic performance [(Rodr\u00edguez-Pose & Wilkie, 2019); (WorldBank, 2009)].

The idea comes from the evidence of now leading but once lagging areas such as Asian Dragons, Flanders in Belgium, Southern Germany, and Las Vegas in the US and also the existence of some declined agglomerations in a series of industrial sectors such as Detroit and Buffalo in the US, Charleroi in Belgium, and Katowice in Poland (Rodr\u00edguez-Pose, 2018). Other reasons that undermine the spill-over mechanism of space-neutral policies to lagging-behind areas are the diminishing strength of agglomeration forces after the so-called Williamson curve (Varga, 2017) , barriers associated with the high levels of mobility of production factors (Partridge et al., 2015) and the region-specific and localized resources for innovation and industrial application of new technologies (Varga & Horv\u00e1th, 2015) . Furthermore, the existence of many large consumer cities in developing countries that depend on the export of raw materials has challenged the idea of agglomerations as the fundamental engine of growth [ (Frick & Rodr\u00edguez-Pose, 2018) ; (Gollin et al., 2016) ].",

This idea was followed by; they utilized the sectorial concept of smart specialization in a regional framework to provide a breakthrough in the European Union cohesion policy. However, some implications threaten place-based policies. Among them, the strong tendency of knowledge to concentrate in prosperous areas rather than on the spatial spillover toward lagging-behind regions (Dunford & Smith, 2000) , weak labor mobility in terms of skill-biased technological changes and uneven distribution of knowledge-intensive economic activities (Iammarino & McCann, 2006) , which lead to the relocation of labor away from such areas and the limited diffusion of innovation to them. Such a strong market mechanism alongside the equity-efficiency problem is likely to weaken many place-based policies. Furthermore, some studies argue that place-based policies might provide the possibility of national versus local welfare trade-off (Kline & Moretti, 2014) .",

Some researchers argue that policies that are largely growth-oriented and based on the dual categories of core-peripheral and metropolitan versus non-metropolitan spaces do not have a strong ability to capture local realities in these areas. These policies should go beyond the need to grow in non-nuclear areas and address this issue from a \"social constructivist perspective\" (Leick & Lang, 2018) . Growing heterogeneity among noncore regions, where almost half of Europe's population lives, highlights the need to reconsider the theoretical understanding of growth and development and regional policies in practice.

Since transport costs fall below the threshold amount, full agglomeration would be the inevitable result. The one-size-fits-all approach in the initial NEG and the imprecise treatment with geography have also been criticized.

First, it identifies unbalanced economic growth and emphasizes large and affluent areas; and second, it sets the primary policy goal of moving people to places with more opportunities rather than shifting opportunities to laggingbehind areas (WorldBank, 2009) . In other words, this approach focuses more on people-based policies in which attention to lagging-behind areas is inefficient at best and diverts the need for structural changes at worst (Partridge et al., 2015) . Therefore, any regional policies emphasizing balanced growth might face a regional equity-national efficiency trade-off. Namely, in the NEG framework, any policy aimed at reducing spatial concentration and regional disparity might have a devastating effect on national growth [see, for example, Baldwin et al. (2011) ]. This implies that policies are in favour of strengthening spatial agglomeration while pursuing the policy of reducing interregional or intraregional disparities is unnecessary and inefficient from a national growth point of view in the NEG model. As an example, the spatial agglomeration or the unbalanced development strategy for boosting national growth in developing countries was recommended by the World Bank's 2009 Development Report.",

The main question about the investigation of initial equilibrium stability of regional distribution is that whether the system backs to its initial equilibrium after a shock happens. It is a matter of testing for the existence of multiple equilibria and hysteresis effects. The allied bombing of Japan and Germany during WWII, the US bombing of Vietnam, the bubonic plague in medieval Italy, and division and reunion of Germany are some samples of shocks that have been considered to assess the existence of multiple equilibria [ (Garretsen & Martin, 2010) ; (Redding, 2010) ]. Weinstein (2002, 2004) considered the effect of the WWII bombing of Japan on the growth of the cities in the post-WWII period. Maarten Bosker et al. (2007) studied the effect of allied bombing WWII in Germany on their post-war development. The general findings of such studies are not in favor of multiple equilibria, as the city's growth returns to its \"pre-shock\" level over time.",

Unlike NEG, spatial agglomeration and dispersion emergence analysis does not require rational location decisions (Frenken & Boschma, 2017) . In the EEG, more attention is paid to the emergence of a particular spatial perspective and its evolution in real historical time. This approach does not explain regional growth differences from a macro-micro perspective but focuses on the microhistories of firms operating in the territorial field.

According to Storper and Venables (2004) and Marquis (2003) , developments in transportation and communication technologies have reduced the impact of geography on economic relations and network formation. But the idea of \"place makes a difference\" emphasizes a place-specific resource profile that has implications for lagging behind areas, considering the characteristics such as low-knowledge intensity and medium-to-low skilled labor pool. Therefore, the policy should provide recommendations to stimulate external knowledge links, especially for industries that have high development costs, are knowledge-intensive, and require a relatively long period to expand into peripheral areas.",
