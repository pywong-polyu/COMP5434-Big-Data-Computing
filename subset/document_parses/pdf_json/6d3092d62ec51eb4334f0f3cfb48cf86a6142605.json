A search in the Web of Science in October 2020 with the key word \"COVID-19\" resulted in more than 43,000 hits. While the majority of these studies were conducted in different fields of medicine, in relative numbers the share of psychological papers was only about 2 percent, with clinical psychology representing more than half of publications in this category. Without a doubt, research on the treatment of the disease, as well as the development and evaluation of vaccines is a priority during a pandemic. Yet, in addition to the direct health-related hazards, the pandemic-along with political measures to fight it-caused tremendous challenges to societies, organizations, employees, and the self-employed all over the globe. Substantial stressors vary from those for individuals (e.g., social distancing, reduced income, restructuring of school, university and work life)",

            "text": "We invited leading scholars in their fields of expertise to provide their insights on six topics related to psychosocial risk factors and coping resources related to pandemics with a focus on the working life. Some of the developments-for instance, a higher share of employees working remotely-will very likely also affect the post-pandemic way of working. Wang, Liu, Qian, and Parker (2021) provide a job design perspective, and shed light on the interplay of virtual work characteristics and individual factors. Allen, Merlo, Lawrence, Slutsky, and Gray (2021) focus on boundary management, considering that working at home has no longer been a free choice by employees. Furthermore, Sinclair, Probst, Watson, and Bazzoli (2021) , in their conceptual paper, provide propositions regarding how structural inequalities (e.g., essential work status, high exposure occupations, public-facing work, and congregate work) and economic stress in combination predict health and well-being of the workforce via risk perception and resource depletion. An occupational group in the spotlight during the pandemic are frontline healthcare workers. Britt, Shuffler, Pegram, Xoxakos, Rosopa, Hirsch, and Jackson (2021) study the dynamics of mental health strain among healthcare workers. The task forces that are installed to manage the crisis situation have to deal with specific demands due to highly urgent, uncertain and volatile environments. In this regard, Thielsch, R\u00f6seler, Kirsch, Lamers, and Hertel (2021) developed a new model of crisis management teams (CMTs) under a pandemic by extending the job demands and resources perspective to teamlevel processes. The psychosocial risks related to the pandemic are inevitable. Hence, it is important to look at ways how people can face these adversities, and still stay mentally healthy. An emerging concept in organizational psychology is resilience. Based on qualitative data and theoretical considerations, Kuntz (2021) provides well-grounded recommendations to foster resilience in the working sphere.",

            "text": "Analyses conducted based on the 2018 American Community Service (ACS) data revealed that 5 million employees in the United States, representing 3.6 percent of the workforce, spent at least half their working hours within a home-based telework setting (Global Workplace Analytics, 2020). In European countries, numbers of teleworkers-that is, individuals who work away from the conventional workplace using computer-based technologies (O'Neill, Hambley, Greidanus, MacDonnell, & Kline, 2009 )-ranged between 0.7 percent and 35.7 percent of the workforce, averaging at 15 percent (Clark, 2020) . During the COVID-19 pandemic, where physical distancing is essential to flatten the epidemiological curve of infections, these numbers drastically increased. A survey based on 800 global HR executives revealed that due to the pandemic 88 percent of organizations encouraged or required employees to work from home (Gartner Inc., 2020) . With the pandemic, and lockdown measures for many, telework was no longer within their own discretion, but rather became the \"new normal.\" Wang et al. (2021) stress the fact that remote work, before the pandemic, has been a privilege for mostly highly educated employees in the upper range of income. Previous research on remote working has mainly taken three approaches. The first approach focused on the question for which employees remote work is best suited, and on the relationship between the intensity or frequency of remote work with performance and well-being (cf. Bailey & Kurland, 2002) . This stream of research indicated mixed findings, pointing towards some advantages of remote working, like increased job satisfaction, and commitment. Given the rather low rate of remote work before the pandemic, samples were selective, mostly highly educated, and chose to work remotely by their own. A second approach was to study how remote work shapes the nature of work, which in turn impacts performance, attitudes, and well-being. In a third approach the specific conditions of working remotely are set in the focus, and they convincingly argue that this paradigm is gaining momentum under the current situation during the pandemic, especially as we cannot simply transfer previous research findings on remote working to the current situation. The abrupt transition from office work to remote work during the pandemic (with only little time to prepare in terms of technical equipment, IT solutions, data security, as well as staff skills to work together remotely), the fact that remote work became obligatory, and was no longer a free choice, the concurrent closing down of schools and kindergartens, as well as the restricted options to meet with colleagues and supervisors face-toface, plus the overall social restrictions in all life domains, call for studying the current situation of remote workers.",

(2021) interviewed 39 full-time employees in China in February 2020 and asked them to describe their current demands, challenges, and resources in their current work situation. This resulted in three broad categories: (1) remote work challenges (including work-home interference, ineffective communication, procrastination, and loneliness), (2) virtual work characteristics (social support, job autonomy, monitoring, workload), and (3) individual factors (self-discipline). These aspects were then implemented in a survey among 522 employees from China. Specifically, indirect effects are proposed, linking virtual work characteristics to employee outcomes (performance, emotional exhaustion, and life satisfaction), via remote working challenges with self-discipline as a moderator. The combination of structural demands, and resources with individual factors provides an enrichment for the study of remote working. While some of the findings might be specific for the pandemic situation, the conceptual model provides an innovative lens for future research in the domain of remote work.",

The declining career prospects (e.g., fewer jobs and reduced working hours) have heightened workers' experience of economic stress. While the workplace is a major point for the transmission of COVID-19, numerous employees are unable to simply step away from work to avoid being exposed to the virus due to their financial strain and the nature of the work status (e.g., essential work and physical contact-intensive work). Sinclair et al.'s (2021) paper looks at the dual threats that workplace virus exposure and economic stress associated with COVID-19 place on individuals in the pandemic era. Drawing from the occupational health and work psychology literature as well as integrating the COVID-19-related facts and examples, the authors have articulated how economic stress factors and COVID-19 occupational risk factors influence workers' safety-related attitudes/behaviors and health/well-being outcomes. By analyzing the roles of factors at the individual, organization (unit), and macro (society) levels in the influence of these dual threats, they offer initial insights that help explain when the harmful consequences of economic stress and occupational risk factors might be alleviated.",

(2021) set the scope of threatening occupational risk factors to be the nature of work manifested by essential work status, high exposure occupations, public-facing work, and congregate work. Their focus of COVID-19-related economic stress is on job insecurity, income (in) adequacy, and underemployment, all of which impact workers' financial status. In Sinclair et al.'s model, these two major categories of threatening factors can first prompt workers' risk perceptions and lead them to sense resource depletion; these undesirable psychological experiences in turn affect individuals' attitudes and behaviors toward COVID-19 and their health and well-being during the pandemic. Situated in this broad framework, they also highlight a potential causal relation denoting the influence of COVID-19 attitudes on health/well-being via behaviors (e.g., compliance with health guidelines), as well as a feedback loop linking these individual outcomes back to the perception of the threatening factors. Extending this rationally hypothetical chain of relationships, Sinclair et al. have further modeled the interaction effects of the two broad threat areas (i.e. occupational risk and economic stress) on risk perception and resource depletion. They have conceptualized that individual (e.g., demographics, COVID knowledge, and death anxiety), organizational (e.g., safety climate and organizational support), and more macro (e.g., governmental policy and societal culture) contextual factors may determine the strength of the chain of relationships described above. Overall, this theoretical framework has comprehensively captured individual workers' psychological, behavioral, and health-related reactions to the pandemic-incurred threats and has indicated possible intervention efforts that may help overcome these threats. We are confident that this framework offers valuable starting points for researchers in applied psychology to empirically test the impact of COVID-19 (and any similar situations) on individual workers.",

During the peak of the first wave, intensive care capacities in some countries did not meet the need of the high numbers of infected persons with a severe course of the disease. This situation even led to the necessity of triage, where decisions had to be made regarding who would get intensive medical treatment, and who would not. At the same time, the appreciation of the work of healthcare workers by the public has been enormous. Healthcare workers were welcomed with applause after their shifts by citizens.

Providing the necessary and matching resources for healthcare workers to stay healthy is not only important from an individual perspective, but becomes a societal concern in order to provide patients with the medical care and treatment they need. The current study sets the stage for studying these factors more rigorously in the future.",

(2021) conducted a qualitative study to understand the nature and the effectiveness of crisis management teams (CMTs) under the COVID-19 pandemic. CMTs are a specific type of team that perform difficult and highly responsible tasks, such as managing the impact of a global pandemic, which requires quick and appropriate operations in ambiguous, risky, and constantly changing environments. Using in-depth structured telephone interviews and online questionnaires with 144 members in various CMTs in Germany, the authors sought to identify specific challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic surrounding CMTs, the resulting specific demands CMT members face, the critical resources that are perceived to be important to cope with the demands, and the behaviors that are perceived to be effective for the work of CMTs during the pandemic.",

These characteristics lead to corresponding difficulties in the work of CMTs, such as high uncertainty, the coordination of various stakeholders, the risk of infection for team members, and long-term operational readiness. The authors then identified various job demands on CMT members imposed by the above-mentioned difficulties, and work-related, personal, and outside-of-work resources that are critical to cope with those demands. Further, their critical incident analyses revealed that the structuring of work processes and open, precise, and regular communication are essential in the operation of CMTs during a pandemic, which will lead to anticipatory, goal-oriented, and quick problem-solving. The authors integrate these results into a new model for CMT management and offer practical recommendations for future training of CMTs.",

In doing so she highlights three resilience trajectories experienced by employees that have been identified in previous work on workplace resilience after crises. The first is a survival trajectory which signals a stress response characterized by impaired cognitive and affective functioning in the immediate aftermath of a crisis. Over time and with adequate resources, this may result in an upward recovery trajectory, or, in the absence of support, may lead employees to experience a downward spiral in their personal well-being. The second is a recovery trajectory under which individuals are able to restore effective psychosocial functioning following a temporary phase of impairment resulting from the crisis. The third is a thriving trajectory, also known as post-traumatic growth, which is a resilience trajectory which ensues from recovery, and is characterized by the development of additional personal and social resources in the aftermath of a crisis. In reviewing the literature on the factors which lead employees to experience recovery or thriving trajectories after experiencing a crisis, she highlights the role of individual factors such as personality traits and early life experiences in supporting individuals to positively appraise adversity and adopt resilient responses. She also highlights organizational-level factors such as supportive leadership, feedback and organizational culture, and clear and supportive communication that may support the resilience trajectories of employees in the aftermath of a crisis.",

The collection of papers presented in this special issue broadens the scope of this research by studying and proposing potential protective factors as an additional focus.

The conceptual paper by Sinclair et al. (2021) highlights that direct and indirect effects of the pandemic hit diverse occupational groups differently. They develop a model of workers' responses to the dual threats of economic insecurity and exposure to health risks, including risk perception and resource depletion as mediating factors that influence the relationship of these threats to mental health and well-being. Studying differential effects is imperative in order to develop prevention and intervention strategies aligned to the needs of specific employment groups. There is still a lack of evidence-based guidance, for instance, for young people on the labour market, as well as for employees with a high-risk profile for developing a severe course of the disease.",

On the one hand, navigating family and work life can become stressful, on the other hand, singles and childless families are at risk, as they may not have \"natural\" boundaries and may face extra workload. Remote working often addresses the perspective of the employee, while it also presents challenges for the supervisor. Supervisors have to balance between allowing individual flexibility and the individual's interest, yet also need to assure team functioning. Setting the focus on leadership opens an interesting avenue for future investigations, especially given leaders' impact on employees' health and well-being. Thielsch et al.'s study (2021) on the demands, resources, and effective work strategies of crisis management teams can also inform us of how teamwork in general can be supported, and might thus be an interesting reference for those interested in team-level processes. There is especially a lack of multilevel perspectives, linking macro-events to organizational policies, human resource management strategies, as well as team-and individual-level processes.",

A different pace of \"normalization\" can be expected across countries and across different employment groups.

The pandemic will be overcome some day, yet the conceptual ideas and empirical evidence collected in this special issue will potentially prevail.
