An aspect, which is often neglected, is that network observations come with errors from different sources, such as estimation and measurement errors, thus a proper statistical treatment of the data is needed before network analysis can be performed. We show that node centrality measures can be heavily affected by random errors and propose a flexible model based on the matrix-variate t distribution and a Bayesian inference procedure to de-noise the data. We provide an application to a network among European financial institutions.",

In mathematical terms, a network can be represented through the notion of a graph and its properties.

A large number of different methodologies have been proposed for the estimation of financial networks from firm return series (e.g., Barigozzi and Brownlees, 2019; Br\u00e4uning and Koopman, 2020) , in particular in the Bayesian approach. For example, Billio et al. (2019) propose a Bayesian non-parametric Lasso prior distribution for vector autoregressive (VAR) models, which provides a sparse estimation of the VAR coefficients and classifies the non-zero coefficients into different clusters. They extract causal networks among financial assets and find that the resulting network topologies match the features of many real-world networks. Ahelegbey et al. (2016a,b) exploit graphical models to specify both the contemporaneous and the lagged causal structures in Bayesian VAR models. In a related contribution, Bianchi et al. (2019) investigate the temporal evolution in systemic risk using a Markov-switching graphical SUR model.",

Our empirical analysis confirms the presence of variability in the network edges.

In each plot, a node represents a firm and its size is proportional to its out-degree. The red dot indicates the most central node inB, that is the node with the highest out-degree inB, and directed edges are represented by clockwise-oriented arcs. The node with the highest out-degree is a financial firm, whereas the most central node according to the other measures belongs to the energy sector. The largest black dot in each plot of Figure 2 represents the most degree-central institution, that is the one with highest out-degree. As shown by the position of the largest dot in the middle and right plots, the most central node varies over the sample.

Motivated by this fact, we assess the importance of de-noising the network data by computing the network centrality measures on the raw data and on the de-noised network obtained using the method in section 2. The results are shown in Figure 4 , which reports the posterior distribution of the centrality measures computed on the denoised network (gray, with the black line representing the posterior mean) and the temporal average of the statistics computed on the raw data (red line). We find that all centrality measures of the de-noised data differ from the temporal average of the raw data; in particular, the eigenvector and betweenness centrality based on the raw data are underestimated, while the closeness centrality is overestimated. Overall, these findings provide evidence that the presence of noise in network data may jeopardize the validity of the ensuing analyses of the network structure.",
