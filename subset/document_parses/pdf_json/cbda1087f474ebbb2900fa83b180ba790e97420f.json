The most utilized remote learning activities for both ECE and ECSE teachers were the provision of activities for families to use at home, communication with families, online lessons, and singing songs and reading books. Both types of professionals spent more time planning and communicating with families than providing instruction to children. Results of chi-square tests of independence revealed differences in activities provided, how time was spent, and training received by professional role. Open-ended responses revealed particular challenges for ECE and ECSE teachers. Findings are discussed in the context of how the early childhood field adapted quickly to remote learning during COVID-19 and the implications for ongoing technology support for early childhood personnel based on their professional role.",

A small number of childcare centers remained open in each state, often to serve the children of essential workers (Hunt Institute, 2020) . However, many preschool programs shifted to remote learning; for example, 75% of New York City preschools and 50% of preschools in the rest of the state provided remote instruction (Tarrant & Nagasawa, 2020) . There was no precedent for providing online instruction to young children from birth through the age of five. The use of technology in early childhood education is often limited, due to the value placed on play-based approaches and concerns about the deleterious impact of screen-time on young children (Plowman et al., 2011) . Early childhood personnel are less likely to have professional access to technology hardware (e.g., laptops, iPads) and to be familiar with the use of learning technologies than K-12 educators (Blackwell et al., 2013; Myrtil et al., 2018) .",

Each pair of researchers compared their emergent codes and intercoder reliability was calculated using percent agreement (Gisev et al., 2013) . Percent agreement for emergent codes for ECE teachers ranged from 84% to 100% (M = 93.50, SD = 0.06). Kappa values for emergent codes for ECE teachers ranged from 0.34 to 1 (M = 0.75, SD = 0.23).

The researcher pairs met to discuss code comparisons, noting all matching codes. Then, the researchers discussed all codes that were not a match. For example, one researcher developed a code called \"families not tech savvy\" that the other researcher had not noted. Through discussion, the two researchers decided that this code should be merged with a code called \"family technology issues\".",

Specific strategies included piloting the survey prior to distribution, creating a comprehensive audit trail for all coding and analysis, conducting interrater reliability for the qualitative analysis of participant responses to the open-ended question about challenges, and peer de-briefing (White et al., 2012) . Member checking was conducted with six participants via Zoom interviews. Participants noted agreement with the resulting themes about challenges. For example, all participants described difficulties reaching some families. One teacher noted that there was a child that she hadn't heard from due to them staying with other family members during the shutdown. Five participants said they received no formal training in how to provide remote learning and did what they could find on their own or from other teachers in their program; one teacher said she was given a quick training on how to use Zoom. Three participants with children who engaged in member checking interviews indicated that it was challenging to provide remote learning with their own children at home. All member checking interview responses mirrored the survey results; there were no changes to the interpretation of findings.",

The reliance on families for remote learning may have placed additional responsibilities on families that were adjusting to public health measures and changes in family and work routines (Goldschmidt, 2020) . There is some evidence that families with children with disabilities may have had a harder time adjusting to remote learning and meeting their children's developmental needs during the pandemic than families with children without disabilities (Murphy et al., 2020) .

In March of 2020, the U.S. Department of Education provided guidance to school districts that they must provide equal access to remote learning for students with disabilities consistent with a free and appropriate public education and must, to the greatest extent possible, provide the special education and related services identified in the student's IEP.

            "text": "ECE and ECSE teachers will need additional resources and training in using remote learning technologies for young children than what they were provided in the spring of 2020. Specifically, ECE and ECSE teachers need training in how to use short activities, how to integrate the use of hands-on materials into synchronous remote instruction, and how to balance synchronous and asynchronous activities for young children (Edelman, 2020; Szente, 2020) . Training for ECE and ECSE teachers will need to focus on teachers' attitudes, their knowledge and skills, and their integration of new knowledge into practice (Chen & Chang, 2006) . ECSE teachers will need specific training, given their differentiated roles and obligation to provide special education and related services for children's IEPs. ECSE teachers were tasked with adjusting special education services for the home setting. There are reports that ECSE personnel struggled to make these necessary accommodations for some young children with disabilities, especially when families did not have therapeutic equipment for their children at home or access to social groups (Warner-Richter & Lloyd, 2020) . Ongoing support for ECSE teachers may focus on how to support families who may not have materials and equipment at home that are typically utilized to the support the child's educational goals and how to address social emotional goals virtually (Patel, 2020) . ECSE teachers will benefit from guidance on the integration of assistive technology into remote learning as well as use of online progress monitoring tools in order to measure progress on IEP goals (Warner-Richter & Lloyd, 2020). Some ECSE teachers who participate in the referral and eligibility determination process may also need support in conducting online assessments, such as those used during initial evaluations for early intervention or preschool special education (Centers for Disease Control, 2020). ECSE and ECE teachers should also receive extra guidance on how to promote the inclusion of young children with disabilities in general education classrooms participating in remote learning, as communication between professionals and a lack of adaptations for children with disabilities were noted as challenges by ECSE teachers.",

The spring of 2020 was a particularly difficult time for early childhood providers to provide remote learning as many programs and districts closed with little to no notice and without clear plans for how online instruction would be delivered. The use of some remote learning and/or hybrid educational approaches is likely to continue for some time, likely resulting in enduring feelings of uncertainty, confusion, and difficulty maintaining work-life balance issues among early educators (Kim et al., 2020) . Early childhood administrators should consider various supports for teachers in addition to training, including logistical support (e.g., childcare options), resources (e.g., material packets for families to accompany online instructional activities), and emotional support (e.g., access to mental health providers).",

Given this, the generalizability of results to professionals working with very young children is cautioned. Further, the results of the study need to be considered in light of the timing in which the survey was administered in the spring of 2020. It is possible that some findings were representative of this specific point in time during the start of the U.S. response to the pandemic and shelter in place orders for most states. Future studies should capture additional aspects of early childhood personnel's use of remote learning, including how ECE and ECSE teachers choose how to use technology in their teaching, how ECE and ECSE use hybrid teaching approaches, and ECE and ECSE teachers' concerns and use of precautions in the return to in-person teaching.",

ECE and ECSE teachers, who had largely eschewed the use of technology for instruction with young children prior to the pandemic, were forced to adopt remote learning technologies due to public health measures that closed many early childhood programs. This study suggests that ECE and ECSE teachers adapted to the situation and provided various remote learning activities, especially those focused on supporting families at home. There were differences in how ECE and ECSE teachers utilized online instruction, suggesting that ongoing training for early childhood personnel should consider their professional role. The conditions around the pandemic are likely to change, including a return to in person learning. However, ECE and ECSE teachers will likely continue to integrate technology into their teaching. Administrators should tailor their technology support to ECE and ECSE teachers based on their roles and responsibilities.",
