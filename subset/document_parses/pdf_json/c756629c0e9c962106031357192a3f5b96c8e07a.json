UAVs can accomplish complex or dangerous tasks in a reliable and cost-effective way but are still limited by power consumption problems, which pose serious constraints on the flight duration and completion of energy-demanding tasks. The possibility of providing UAVs with advanced decision-making capabilities in an energy-effective way would be extremely beneficial. In this paper, we propose a practical solution to this problem that exploits deep learning on the edge. The developed system integrates an OpenMV microcontroller into a DJI Tello Micro Aerial Vehicle (MAV). The microcontroller hosts a set of machine learning-enabled inference tools that cooperate to control the navigation of the drone and complete a given mission objective. The goal of this approach is to leverage the new opportunistic features of TinyML through OpenMV including offline inference, low latency, energy efficiency, and data security. The approach is successfully validated on a practical application consisting of the onboard detection of people wearing protection masks in a crowded environment.",

TinyML aims to bring ML inference into devices characterized by a very low power consumption. This enables intelligent functions on tiny and portable devices with a power consumption of less than 1 mW. As TinyML targets microcontroller unit (MCU) class devices, the trained and developed models must conform to the hardware and software constraints of MCUs. Therefore, many TinyML frameworks have been developed to fully exploit MCU resources and ensure the optimization of the model converted from the original model, e.g., the TensorFlow Lite for Microcontrollers (TFLM) framework.

In [12] , the authors present a long short-term memory (LSTM) inference algorithm to predict future mobile traffic using back-propagation-based neural network training. They proposed the division of the entire coverage area into clusters using a joint k-means and an EM algorithm of a Gaussian mixture model. As their approach required a central intelligence, the optimization was performed at the ground station. Q-learning is another technique used in many UAV applications to find an optimal flight path and recharge method that maximizes the total flight duration of the UAV. As an example, in [13] , the UAV received updated information at each step and a UAV base station was used for battery recharging by a wireless power transfer from another flight source. Although the proposed scheme probably required onboard computation, no implementation details were provided because the authors based their analysis on simulations. A meta-gradient inspired ML model over a wireless network was proposed in [14] , called hierarchical nested personalized federated learning (HN-PFL). Such a technique optimizes the trade-off between energy consumption and the performance of a machine learning model by configuring the exchange of data among UAVs.",

The proposed approach is completely centralized as it requires the interconnection of the UAVs to a network of interconnected base stations, which are coordinated by a central control node.",

As an example, a detection task might require a better framing of the target object; this in turn implies the positioning of the drone in a more suitable position, which has to be translated into a set of control commands.

This in turn led to problems in capturing sufficiently stable images (e.g., motion blur, imperfect framing), often resulting in the loss of the target. To solve this problem, we introduced a PID controller in the loop [23] . The PID provided a simple but effective solution to stabilize the drone as each variable could be treated separately within a limited range where the MAV action was roughly linear. For each control iteration, we calculated the error between the actual position and the target position (which considered the position of the target to be classified). If the actual value was greater than the target value, a positive error was sent back to the system. The error was then normalized and sent to the PID, which calculated the new values for the speed of the motors. For the proportional term, we multiplied the error by a gain factor, which was set at 0.5 after several experimental trials. To control the derivative term, the difference between the current and the previous error was calculated and again multiplied by a gain factor of 0.5. Accordingly, the integral term was set by summing the errors over various steps and applying a gain factor to the cumulative error. Once we calculated all the correction factors, we transmitted the new speed values to the drone. To deal with out-of-range situations, we truncated the values in the range of +/-100.",

In Figure 2 , we represent the dataset. Even after rescaling and color conversions, image features have a high dimensionality that prevents suitable visualization. For this reason, a dimensionality reduction was applied to reduce the image to a 3D space (the three visualization layers). To train the model, we randomly selected 1000 images, equally divided into images with and without face masks. Each image was resized to 96 96 pixels. The number of samples was chosen to comply with the constraints of the selected microcontroller and to optimize the model size. As far as the neural architecture was concerned, in our application we selected a convolutional neural network (CNN) to train a model compatible with the TinyML deployment. The face mask detection model uses MobileNet V2 architecture (see Figure 3) , a well-known and proven architecture developed for image classifications [26] . MobileNet V2 consists of a stack of 16 depth-wise separable convolutional layers with an average pool followed by a fully connected layer and a SoftMax at the end. The width multiplier was chosen at 0.35 as it was optimized for our microcontroller in terms of RAM usage and an effective computation reduction. One of the critical points in bringing a deep architecture onto a tiny processor is the need to reduce as much as possible the complexity without significantly affecting the accuracy. One of the common practices consists of reducing the precision requirements for both the weights and the activations [27] . This is an essential step to compress the model to meet the hardware constraints of the OpenMV microcontroller. Although quantization is still an open research topic, it has become a standard compression method for TinyMLrelated applications. It allows the consumption of less flash memory and RAM whilst maintaining almost the same accuracy of the original model [28] . Moreover, compressing the network from 32-bit to 8-bit results in a significantly faster processing, shorter inference time, and lower power consumption.",

The stability of a drone is controlled by three main sensors (i.e., gyroscopes, accelerometers, and barometers); the SoC was measured by the voltage and current sensors via a Tello software development kit (SDK). The energy consumption of a drone varies in different states including take off, reaching the desired altitude, hovering, and maneuvering. Therefore, it was important to create a consistent test scenario for all the setups. For this purpose, all the tests were performed in equal conditions where the UAV hovered at a relative altitude of 5 m.

The Arduino Nano was chosen because of its light weight and low power consumption. The Arduino was equipped with an OV7675 camera that was used to capture data as the input to our face mask detection application. Although the Arduino was able to run the model, it took 7 seconds to perform the inference during the live classification and most of the time it failed to fully complete the classification process due to the limited RAM. Overall, the Arduino Nano did not work when the model was used for practical testing. To test the OpenMV microcontroller, we used the same model to deploy the application and run the inference. The live classification time was 859 ms with the RAM peak still below the maximum of the device. OpenMV outperformed the Arduino Nano in all comparison criteria. Nevertheless, the decision matrix for the live classification of the model showed that both microcontrollers achieved the same results. Therefore, we concluded that OpenMV was more effective for our proposed system (see Figure 4 ). Table 2 shows the average energy consumption (kJoule) and flight time (min:sec) measured across the various tests in the different setups of the system (no payload, Arduino payload, and the proposed system based on the OpenMV payload). The performances were measured in different states and flight operations. For the idle state, the UAV was powered on without the four motors rotating; only the internal processing and LEDs were on, thus resulting in a rather stable and low power consumption. For the hovering state, the UAV was made to take off and hover at a certain altitude as hovering between altitudes caused fluctuations in the energy consumption due to sudden consumption spikes when climbing to higher altitudes. The results showed that the hovering state maintained a reasonably stable power consumption as when the UAV hovered, the forces acting on the UAV were ideally balanced. Moreover, the maneuvering state was the most energy-demanding state. In horizontal flight with a limited speed, the energy consumption fluctuated somewhat but tended to stabilize over time. The energy consumption during horizontal flight was slightly higher than the energy consumption of hovering at the same altitude. This was the result of the different thrust developed by the drone in the two different modes.",

The results in terms of the energy consumption and flight time are reported in Table 3 and could be compared with the proposed system (same data of Table 2 , Column 3). We noted that the distributed inference approach was slightly less energy-demanding compared with the completely onboard system and close to the Arduino-equipped setup. Nevertheless, it should be pointed out that in this case we lost the real-time capability as every decision (detection, classification, navigation) required a communication loop with a significant round-trip time. Furthermore, if the system needed to operate in an environment where it was not possible to establish a stable connection or to place a ground station, the distributed model fell short. ",

            "text": "In this paper, we presented a novel approach to endow drones with a larger autonomy and intelligence thanks to the integration of a joint flight and mission control embedded system. Thanks to the adoption of a powerful lightweight processing architecture and a suitably designed ML inference engine, the system implemented an edge computing solution that enabled the achievement of sophisticated mission goals without severely limiting the flight duration. The energy consumption of the system was tested in various setups and flying scenarios to demonstrate its energy efficiency. An experimental validation was performed on a significant sample application and showed that the impact of the integration of the microcontroller on the payload was tolerable with respect to the added value in terms of the intelligence of the system, thus making the system viable in practical contexts. Future work will include the implementation of further use cases in different application domains and the extension to other drone models to promote a broader adoption of the proposed technology.
