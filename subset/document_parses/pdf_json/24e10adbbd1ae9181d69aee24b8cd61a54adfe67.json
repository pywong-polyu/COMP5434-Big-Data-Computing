According to the theory of normative social behavior, network members are likely to share social norms and behavior [12] . Behavior, regardless of whether positive or negative, is modeled by and imitated from these similar others [13] .

Social networks include various types of relationships, such as family, friends, colleagues, or neighbors. Relationships might be further typed as strong or weak. Strong relationships are emotionally close, geographically close, or recurring interactions, such as family members, close-friends, or neighbors. Strong relationships may provide emotional support and practical support which can be important to make and maintain a healthy behavior change [17, 18] . Strong relationships are able to 'control' health behavior directly by facilitating resources or indirectly by introduction of norms and acting as 'role models' [15, 19, 20] .",

Until now, data are lacking on which social network aspects play a role in the practice of non-pharmaceutical infection-preventive behaviors. Here, we examine this role of a wide-range social network aspects in the period just preceding the COVID-19 pandemic. In line with findings in vaccination behavior [9, 10] , we hypothesize that informational support may also enable non-pharmaceutical infection preventive behavior, as well as the presence of positive role models, which can be family or friends.",

A respondent without household members was defined as living alone. Homophily by sex indicated the proportion of network members with the same sex as the respondent. Homophily by age was the proportion of network members with the same age (within a five-year range). Contact with children was defined for children younger than five years. Mode of contact was assessed in the past two weeks, indicated by the number of network members who were contacted only in-person, only via telephone/internet, or via both modes. The number of network members was then categorized into four categories: zero members, one to two members, three to five members and six or more members. Network density was indicated by whether the respondents' friends knew the respondents' family. Lastly, social participation was assessed as club membership, i.e., sports clubs, religious or volunteer organizations, or talking, self-help, or internet groups.",

Strong relationships also include members who live within walking distance or members from whom practical support was received, as this usually reflects people who are geographically close and with whom there has been in-person contact.

Multivariate logistic (for the separate preventive behaviors) and multivariate ordinal (for the count variable on behaviors) regression analyses were performed, calculating odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals. Multivariate model (I) included as independent variables the social network characteristics, and confounders (see below). Then, a multivariate model (II) was created including all social network aspects that were associated with the outcome (by a p-value <0.05) in model I, and including confounders. To obtain the final model (II), we used a stepwise backward method for the social network variables (while keeping the confounders in the model) [25] . Confounding variables were sociodemographic factors (sex, age, educational level) [26] [27] [28] [29] , chronic conditions (depression, type II diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular diseases, asthma/COPD) [24, [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] , lifestyle factors (BMI, current smoking) [5, 36] and self-reported upper and lower respiratory infections in the previous two months [25, 37] , as these variables previously were found to be associated with the dependent and independent variables.

Friends are likely to indirectly control health behavior, e.g., act as behavioral role models, introducing descriptive norms for specific behaviors [14, 19, 20, 38] . Friends may also provide all types of social support, i.e., emotional, practical as well as informational. Although no specific 'friends-provided' support type could be identified in our data, the association with share of friends was independent from receiving informational support, suggesting that the 'effect' of friends goes beyond providing informational support [17, 18] . Except for friends, no other social network aspect that may indicate 'strong relations' was found to be associated, as family members or neighbors, who may mainly provide emotional and practical support. Close family, spouses, or household members, have previously been identified important in promoting other lifestyle behaviors as healthy eating, smoking cessation, and vaccination uptake [3, [5] [6] [7] . It should be noted that what appears important from our model II, is to have a higher share of friends in one's total network composition, not just having more friends. Further, we noted two social network aspects that decreased the likelihood of practicing more preventive behaviors. These were age-homophily, i.e., when a larger share of the existing network was composed by same-age members, and social participation, i.e., having a club membership. Whether these aspects indicated strong or weak relations was unknown, as not all network aspects could be attributed to relationship-strength. One of the possible mechanisms explaining these inverse associations may be social influence. Individuals tend to adapt their behaviors or attitudes as a result of interaction with others [13, 39] . Another mechanism could be social selection processes. People tend to connect with other individuals who are similar to themselves [11, 40, 41] .",

Nevertheless, by also exploring the separate behaviors, we noted some additional social network aspects to be associated in model II, i.e., a larger overall network size in washing hands (thus in this behavior the mode of contact and support received was less important than the absolute number of relationships). For using paper tissues, having contact with children younger than five years of age, the proportion of network members of a younger age, and living alone was found to be associated (alongside informational support).",

Alternative explanations of observed associations are also possible. For example, the association with online/telephone only interactions may also reflect an active refraining from in-person contacts due to a fear of getting infected or due to fear of transmitting an infection to a network member, or when not being able/not wanting to have in-person contact due to illness or infection symptoms in the respondent. While the first possibility (fear) was not measured in our study, the latter two were considered unlikely to explain our results, since both multivariate models were adjusted for respondents' self-reported respiratory infections.",

This study identified several social network aspects that were positively associated with behaviors known to be effective in preventing respiratory infections. Results indicate that weak relationships that provide informational support, with whom there can be online/telephone interactions, and strong relationships, i.e., to have a large share of friends in the network, are potentially likely to play an important role in the adoption of infection prevention behaviors. It may now be further explored how to employ these network aspects for the strengthening of non-pharmaceutical infection-control strategies in the middle aged and older population, which is especially relevant in the current context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Basic preventive behavior can be induced by role models (e.g., friends) or receiving advice or information from more distant network members. Further, we may invent new strategies to increase the share of friends in the composition of one's network and employ such connections to promote infection preventive behaviors. Specifically, the strengthening of the so called 'weak relationships', as the modes of interactions that provide informational support, that do not have to be in-person, thus possibly via online channels, is worth to be explored further. Such online contact opportunities may especially be useful in the current situation, where the COVID-19 pandemic led to widespread application of isolation, quarantine, and physical distancing, already likely shifting the use of these modes of interactions. Previous studies have shown that the internet can be used to receive social support from or social interaction with others [42, 43] . This reasoning leads to exploring the promotion of new/linking to already existing online, interactive, informal information platforms that allow people to exchange information and advice. Existing public health websites may be included because these provide information about the reasons why preventive behavior can be important and how to apply preventive measures; interacting with social network members contributes to increasing awareness of one's behavior. Health care organizations could play an important role in such platforms, as they can facilitate validated information [43] . Future studies need to investigate how to promote such interactive, online platforms.",

(1) Although by our measures we assumed that the social network aspects precede the infection-preventive behaviors (current/recent behaviors are reported), the nature of the study is cross-sectional, precluding conclusions on the causality of observed effects. Yet, it is likely that the social network composition, that is usually more or less stable at least for some time in non-pandemic times [45] , precedes the current reported infection prevention behaviors. (2) Strong and weak relationships were defined by rough approximation only (more detailed information on relationship-strength was not available in the dataset). (3) Our outcome measures were behaviors, which were self-reported and therefore subject to information bias. Participants were asked if they washed their hands regularly with water and soap, but regularly was not further defined. Self-reporting also might result in socially desirable answers and thus possibly an overestimation of preventive behaviors. However, the questionnaire was online and could be filled in in the private environment of one's own home, limiting social desirability bias. Also, handwashing was reported quite frequently, somewhat limiting the power to detect associations when evaluating this specific outcome. (4) Respondents represented a middle aged to older population living independently at home, of whom one third reported one or more chronic conditions. Nearly half of the respondents were highly educated. Thus overall, respondents in this study may not completely represent the adult population of Limburg, the Dutch region of study.",
