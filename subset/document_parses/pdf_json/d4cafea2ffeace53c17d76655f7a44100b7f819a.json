Although our analysis of vaccination effectiveness may be limited by cohort size, importantly, a reduction in HR was observed with each vaccine dose, highlighting the benefit of vaccination in this cohort. These results form the basis for the guidance we provide our patients, which includes (1) the likely benefits of 2-dose vaccination regimens and (2) the importance of continued adherence to public health guidelines about masking and physical distancing to reduce infection risk. We were unable to directly address the role of mixed-dose vaccines, as only a very small minority received 2 different vaccines ( Table  S3 , SDC, http://links.lww.com/TP/C367). Importantly, although the antibody levels that confer resistance to infection are unknown, recent work demonstrates that a third vaccine dose yields greater immunogenicity in transplanted individuals. [3] [4] [5] [6] We note that our study predates the emergence of the Omicron variant, which is rapidly gaining dominance worldwide. Future studies must examine whether multidose vaccination strategies enhance real-world vaccine effectiveness among transplant patients in the Omicron era. The model adjusts for age (per 1 y increase), sex, transplant duration, latest eGFR, and geographical COVID-19 burden. The following were treated as time-varying variables: vaccine (none, 1, and 2 doses), transplant duration (0-3, 3-12, and >12 mo), and COVID-19 community infection burden per 100 000 population (HR reflects an increase in 10/100 000 population).
