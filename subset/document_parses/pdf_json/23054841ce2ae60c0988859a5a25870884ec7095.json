Analysis of genetic sequence data gathered over the course of the pandemic allows us to link the dynamics associated with networks of connected individuals with specific interventions. In this study, clusters of transmission were inferred from a phylogenetic tree representing the relationships of patient sequences sampled from December 30, 2019 to April 17, 2020. Metadata comprising sampling time and location were used to define the global behavior of transmission over this earlier sampling period, but also the involvement of individual regions in transmission cluster dynamics.

These population dynamics, though often reflective of the neutral processes of evolution (5) , can at times be traced to significant ecological and epidemiological events (6) . Sample collection dates are critical in these connections, as when combined with the assumption of relatively stable mutation rates over time, allow for genetic differences to be rescaled as differences in time. The timing of population changes, inferred from genetic changes, can then be compared with external, contextual data (e.g., (7) ) to investigate potential links between public health interventions (or other relevant events) and viral population growth and spread. Global analyses of viral spread using genomic data can reveal important information regarding the emergence of a novel virus, such as the phylogenetic analysis of H1N1 (8), which informed the community of the adaptive process of H1N1 from its original host (swine) to humans and its subsequent challenges in escape from the human immune system. Since then, large projects aimed at facilitating and optimizing the sharing of data and results for real-time projections of viral spread have helped in tracking SARS-CoV-2 global dissemination (e.g., (9, 10)). Yet, given that viruses evolve at a relatively rapid rate, considering separate isolated geographic areas as separate epidemics may also be warranted when attempting to understand how regional efforts drive viral evolutionary and population dynamic patterns. A virus from patristic distance (branch length separating sequences within the tree) of <0.009% (see Sup- plementary Materials) in a maximum likelihood (ML) phylogenetic tree inferred from 11,069 SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequences. This distance, representing the median genetic difference between two sampled individuals is less than the median difference observed within a single individual (0.014%) in the study by Shen et al. (2020) (15) on patients admitted with COVID-19 pneumonia. By only considering individuals that share a genetic distance less than would be expected during the evolution of the virus within a single host, we have greater confidence in infections separated by a short amount of time and thus an epidemiological linkage or connection;",

In terms of country representation within transmission clusters, the majority of the identified clusters included viral sequences isolated from patients in 1 \u2212 5 countries, with the majority country in clusters comprised of only two countries representing 50-99% of the sequences ( Figure 1B ). Clusters including 6-10 countries were more evenly distributed, while the majority country represented 70% of the sequences in the only cluster with strains from 11 countries. The results collectively indicate a significant role for travel in connecting several countries through putative direct transmission events, rather than isolated epidemics seeded by single introductions, consistent with previous studies (16, 17).",

            "text": "As with conventional epidemiological analyses, sampling bias can impact results and interpretation and has been inherent to SARS-CoV-2 sample collection throughout the pandemic (18). In our analysis, the number of clusters involving each of the countries with available sequence data as of April 24, 2020, were distributed similarly to the number of available genomes indicating, unsurprisingly, that the number of clusters detected for a particular country is limited 5 by the number of available samples from that locale (Figure 2A) . Hence, no direct comparison could be made regarding the number of clusters involving different countries. This was not the case, however, for the average size (number of persons) of clusters associated with each country, since large clusters were not always detected in countries with more samples available, such as the United Kingdom (UK) and United States of America (USA) ( Figure 2B ). In other words, despite potential lack of information from countries with reduced datasets, a global perspective on transmission cluster patterns related to cluster size might nevertheless be investigated. It is important to keep in mind that low sequence presence is not necessarily an indicator of low infection rates, as the fraction of total infected individuals that were sampled may, in fact, be high for these countries, resulting in a different type of regional sampling bias. For example, although as of April 24, over 3,000 sequences were submitted for the UK, this comprised < 25% of total infections, whereas Hong Kong reportedly submitted at least one genome for every confirmed case ( Figure 2C ). Given that individuals linked through transmission in a small amount of time share a small genetic difference, on which phylogenetic cluster inference relies, missed sampling can prevent the inclusion of individuals within a cluster. Hence, we anticipated that sampled individuals from countries with sequencing more representative of the infected population (i.e., genome per confirmed case value closer to 1) would be more likely to cluster, resulting in a larger fraction of clustered individuals. However, there was no clear relationship (linear regression R 2 < 0.0084) between the percentage of individuals within a country that are included in clusters and the number of retrieved genomes per confirmed cases ( Figure 2C ). This finding indicates that country-specific contributions to clustering were not biased toward countries with larger fractions of sampled individuals from the infected population. Therefore, sub-sampling as an effort to mitigate the effects of sampling bias at the country level, though often performed for phylogenetic analyses of viral geographical spread (19), was not deemed necessary for our study. On the other hand, it is important to notice that due to the lack of information on sam-6 pling strategies used to gather available sequence data, we could not rule out possible effects of selection bias (i.e., preferential sampling). For example, in certain countries for which representative sequencing was low but clustering rate was high, we cannot exclude that sampling efforts were focused on presumed contact networks in order to locate and quarantine infections.",

The time to the most recent common ancestor (TMRCA) of all sequence data was estimated to be For the majority of the transmission clusters detected in the tree, TMRCAs (i.e., a cluster's temporal origin) dated back prior to Feb 20, 2020, with a peak observed between the first week of February until the first week of March ( Figure 3A ). These results were robust to genetic distance thresholds of 0.006% and 0.013% ( Figure S2 ), the latter value representing the 2.5th percentile of tree-wide distances and maximum diversity observed in Shen et al. (2020) (15), as described above. Following this time, a sharp decline in number of newly formed clusters was evident. Furthermore, despite differing patterns in the number and size of clusters across individual countries, the global peak in clusters size coincided with the peak in number of new clusters, around the end of February, as did the number of countries represented in each cluster ( Figure 3A ). The overlapping peaks in cluster number and size, as well as number of countries/cluster in time, suggest a common underlying factor responsible for the decrease in the rate of cluster formation, growth, and connectivity at the global level. Thus, it appeared reasonable to hypothesize that efforts to reduce international travel at the beginning of the epidemic 7 played a role.",

The early, elevated rate of accumulation of travel bans, largely comprised of restriction on immigration from China began to slow on February 15 (slowed accumulation for Chinaspecific bans on the 6th) ( Figure 3B ). Accumulation in the number of restrictions remained low until the onset of nationwide lockdowns (first reported March 08), at which time the steep decline in overall cluster TMRCA, size, and geographical range began. These results strongly suggest that reduced international travel slowed the formation, growth, and connectivity of transmission clusters, whereas more local interventions were necessary, and more effective, in preventing local virus spread.",

While it is important to note that accuracy of R 0 estimation is reduced for outbreaks characterized by true R 0 \u2265 5 (23), clusters representing increased secondary infection rates as compared to the majority population are of importance in the control of infection. As R 0 > 1 is indicative of sustainable transmission and vice versa, we investigated the timing and duration of both low(< 1)and high(> 1)-R 0 clusters. High-R 0 clusters were more frequently observed between February and early March ( Figure 4C ), consistent with the temporal peak in global cluster size. There was no relationship between R 0 and duration (R 2 < 3.69E \u2212 06), suggesting clusters with R 0 < 1 were still sustained for various lengths of time. Although seemingly counter-intuitive, this finding can be explained by dynamic transmission patterns, such as a change in the contact network, or even a later introduction of unsampled super-spreaders. As the R 0 calculation is derived from early estimates of the viral effective population size, this value does not depict the full transmission potential of the group of individuals within the cluster.",

Identification of these putative transmission clusters, coupled with phylogenetic inference of cluster dynamics and relevant epidemiological parameters, has provided evidence of a global pattern in cluster formation, growth, connectivity, as well as transmission potential over time. The slow rise and subsequent rapid fall in the number and size of forming clusters over the period of December 30 to April 20, 2020, may have been the results of a change in global transmission patterns and/or a rate of sampling that did not adequately capture, as recently reported (28), the increased rate in the number of infected individuals. According to the latter scenario, missed sampling of individuals involved in a transmission cluster can prevent the detection of links via genetic data, or even conventional surveillance data. However, the similar temporal pattern observed for the number of countries connected by individual clusters also suggests a relationship between cluster formation, growth, and connectivity and that an outside force was responsible for changing global transmission patterns, rather than problematic sampling over time.",

Whereas additional modeling using recorded travel data would be highly beneficial in teasing apart the effects of international and 11 China-specific travel restrictions on transmission characteristics, the drastic halt in cluster activity beginning the first week of March directly coincides with the date of onset of nationwide lockdowns.

Using viral sequence data and the phylogenetic relationships among sampled individuals, particularly for an exponentially growing epidemic of limited data availability (23), we can model relevant epidemiological parameters of interest used in determining the transmission potential for clusters involving individual countries. It is important to keep in mind that the results of any phylogenetic study that are dependent on a single tree assume that that a tree best describes the underlying phylogenetic relationships. While it is often best to summarize results across a sample of similarly plausible trees using Bayesian methods (33, 34), Bayesian tree reconstruction methods are highly parametric and have difficulty converging on a reliable distribution of trees and related evolutionary parameters for datasets as large as that of SARS-CoV-2. For this reason, we only focused this study on portions of the maximum likelihood tree that were considered to be well supported. Similarly, invaluable methods exist for the detection and epidemiological characterization of transmission clusters within the Bayesian framework, such as the multi-state birth death model (bdmm) (35); however, even terventions. As our study is based on hypotheses regarding not only cluster characteristics but also cluster size distribution, a skew towards detection of larger clusters as a result of this loss of information was undesirable. Post hoc transmission characterization of individual clusters using a Bayesian framework for population dynamics estimates that has demonstrated accuracy for low-signal sequence data (i.e., small clusters) (23) was thus ideal for an in-depth investigation of transmission cluster dynamics at the global and regional scales. Using this method, four countries (the USA, Belgium and neighboring Luxembourg, and the UK) were identified as harboring isolated clusters with elevated transmission potential following the global initiation of nationwide lockdowns, potentially fostered by super-spreaders. Federal policies regarding lockdowns were put into place for Belgium, Luxembourg, and the UK beginning mid-March, which were likely necessary in absolving highly active clusters such as those observed in this study; though federal guidelines were issued at a similar time in the USA (March 16th), mandatory US policy regarding lockdowns was not put into motion, allowing individual states to adopt their own policies at different times. Depending on the location of transmission clusters within the USA, delayed lockdowns could have resulted in continued rapid transmission of the virus.",
