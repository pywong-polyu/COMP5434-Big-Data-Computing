They are rod-shaped (30-60 \u00d7 250-300 nm) large enveloped viruses with circular, supercoiled double-stranded DNA genomes, approximately 80-180 kb in size. While most of the baculoviruses infect their natural host, i.e., butterflies and moths (Lepidoptera), few are also known to infect sawflies (Hymenoptera) and mosquitoes (Diptera) (King et al. 2011 ). They have not been linked with any disease in any organism outside the phylum Arthropoda (Kost and Condreay 2002) . Baculoviruses are well known for their role as biopesticides and are efficient tools for heterogeneous protein production in insect cells (Summers 2006) . Morphologically, these enveloped viruses have been classified into two phenotypes: occlusion-derived viruses (ODVs) that are embedded in paracrystalline matrix forming polyhedral occlusion bodies (OBs) which are responsible for horizontal transmission between insects and the budded viruses (BuVs) present in the haemolymph which spreads infection from cell to cell (Luckow and Summers 1988) . Occlusion body morphology was initially used to define two major groups of baculoviruses: nucleopolyhedroviruses (NPVs) and the granuloviruses (GVs). NPVs obtain their envelop from host nuclear membrane and are occluded within main occlusion protein polyhedrin forming large (1-15 \u03bcm) polyhedral inclusion bodies, while GVs obtain their envelop from cell membrane to make oval-shaped single virion structure called granule or capsule with diameter in the range of 0.2-0.4 \u03bcm (King et al. 2011) . NPVs are further distinguished as single nucleopolyhedrovirus or multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus based on the number of nucleocapsids in a polyhedral inclusion body (O'Reilly et al. 1994) . OBs allow virions to remain infectious for long period due to their highly resistant and stable structure.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 433, "end": 450, "text": "(King et al. 2011", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 543, "end": 567, "text": "(Kost and Condreay 2002)", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}, {"start": 708, "end": 722, "text": "(Summers 2006)", "ref_id": "BIBREF86"}, {"start": 1091, "end": 1116, "text": "(Luckow and Summers 1988)", "ref_id": "BIBREF49"}, {"start": 1594, "end": 1612, "text": "(King et al. 2011)", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 1778, "end": 1800, "text": "(O'Reilly et al. 1994)", "ref_id": "BIBREF66"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Baculovirus-infected insect cell expression system has been used for the routine production of recombinant proteins, including several proteins of therapeutic nature over the last three decades.

It was produced with a recombinant Autographa californica multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus (AcMNV) by exploiting its polyhedrin promoter (Smith et al. 1983 ).

However, injection of only glycoprotein E2 in pigs is reported to sufficiently provide protection to CSFV (Van Rijn et al. 1996) . Therefore, a subunit vaccine has been produced on the basis of conserved glycoprotein E2 with a baculovirus vector in insect cells (Moormann et al. 2000) . Glycoprotein E2 being expressed as envelop protein, its C-terminal transmembrane domain was removed to secrete it into the medium, and the residual baculovirus was inactivated with 2-bromoethyl-imminebromide. This vaccine was manufactured and commercialized as \"Porcilis Pesti \u00ae \" by MSD Animal Health. The same vaccine was also commercialized as \"BAYOVAC CSF E2 \u00ae /Advasurea\" by Bayer AG/Pfizer Animal Health but was later discontinued. (b) Virus-like particle (VLP)-based vaccine for porcine circovirus type 2: Porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) vaccine was developed based on VLPs. PCV2 is the primary causative agent of postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS) in swine. Two major open reading frames (ORF1 and ORF2) have been identified in PCV2. ORF2 encodes a major structural protein with typespecific epitopes and is found to be highly immunogenic. Therefore, ORF2 that encodes the capsid protein was used to develop the vaccine with a baculovirus in Tn5 insect cells (Liu et al. 2008 MSD Animal Health got the same products licensed by two names in different geographical areas 9 Preventive, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Applications (c) VLP-based vaccine for porcine parvovirus (PPV): PPV, a non-enveloped DNA virus, causes major reproductive failure in swine. Its viral capsid is made up of 50-60 molecules of VP2, the major structural protein that are being targeted for vaccine development. VP2 gene was expressed under the control of late p10 promoter of baculovirus and the LacZ gene under the control of Drosophila hsp 70 promoter. The recombinant baculovirus AcAs3-PPV was used to infect Sp21 insect cell line to express VP2 that leads to self-assembled empty PPV VLPs in serum-free medium for safety point of view (Maranga et al. 2002) . Earlier, it was also produced in Sf9 cells in the presence of serum proteins. However, its commercialization at large scale still needs more developmental efforts. Monovalent and bivalent VLP vaccines are being developed for two serotypes 1 and 4 of BTV. BTV-1 exhibits more protection to virulent BTV live strain as compared to BTV-4. Earlier, VLP expressing capsid proteins VP2 and VP5 were developed by co-transfection of dual transfer vector DNA (pAcVC3/BTV-10-2/BTV-10-5) with wild-type AcNPV DNA in insect cells (French et al. 1990 ).

Rubella virus (RV) normally causes a self-limiting disease, but its infection during the first trimester of pregnancy may cause foetal damage. Therefore, serological diagnostic test was developed by expressing E1, E2 and polyprotein precursor of rubella virus as antigen for enzyme immunoassay (EIA) and immunoblot analysis of patient sera (Sepp\u00e4nen et al. 1991) . Trypanosoma cruzi causes Chagas' disease in Latin America. Flagellar repetitive antigen (FRA), part of T. cruzi-based improved diagnostic assay, was developed for Chagas' disease (dos Santos et al. 1992 ). Fulllength human glutamic acid decarboxylases (GAD65 and GAD67) with histidine tag were produced in their natural conformations for the development of an immunoassay for the diagnosis of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (Mauch et al. 1993) . Hantavirus which causes haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) nucleocapsid protein of strain SR-11 (rNP-SR-Sf9) was used as antigen for the indirect immunofluorescence antibody (IFA) diagnostic test that detects three serotypes (hantan 76-118, SR-11 and Puumala) of hantavirus (Yoshimatsu et al. 1993) . Purified human papillomavirus (HPV) E2 protein was used to develop ELISA to detect IgG and IgA responses in cervical neoplasia patients (Rocha-Zavaleta et al. 1997) . Houston/90 (Hou/90) is a human calicivirus (HuCV) strain in one of the three clades of Sapporo-like HuCVs that cause acute gastroenteritis in children. The viral capsid gene of Hou/90 capsid was used as antigen for immunoprecipitation and EIA (Jiang et al. 1998 ). Herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection is caused by two viruses HSV-1 and HSV-2. Diagnostic test that can distinguish between two strains has been developed that utilizes both type-specific and type-common HSV antigens in a single-step assay format to perform accurate diagnosis (Burke 1999; Wald and Ashley-Morrow 2002; Liu et al. 2015) . Eight different strains of human caliciviruses (HuCVs) capsid proteins have been used to develop antigen-antibody detection assay by EIAs that are highly specific (Jiang et al. 2000) . Causative agent of tick-borne encephalitis (TBE), C-terminus truncated form of protein E (Etr) of TBE complex virus tagged with histidine was used to develop sensitive and specific ELISA as well as immunoblot assay to detect the TBE virus-specific antibodies in infected individuals (Marx et al. 2001) . Fel dl, the major allergen from cats, consists of two polypeptide chains, chain 1 (ch1) and chain 2 (ch2), which are usually linked with a disulphide bond. Recombinant Fel dl (rFel dl Ch1 + Ch2) protein construct in which two chains are linked together with glycine/serine linker was used as more potent antigen than bacterial-derived proteins for the detection of IgE and IgG antibodies by radioimmunoassay (RIA) and ELISA (Guyre et al. 2002) . Coeliac disease (CD) is characterized by the presence of autoantigen transglutaminase (TG). Recombinant human tissue TG (hu-tTG) expressed with baculovirus system was used as antigen for ELISA that showed a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 98.6% (Osman et al. 2002) . The envelope glycoproteins: gB, gD, gC, gE and gG are thought to be the primary targets of IgG antibody response in patients with Herpes B virus (HBV) infection. Therefore, ELISA test was developed by using the cocktail of these recombinant glycoproteins along with other capsid proteins with high sensitivity and specificity (Perelygina et al. 2005) . Similarly, the recombinant proteins in single or multiple subunits for the diagnosis of different types of viral infections in humans have been developed with baculovirus expression system in insect cells.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 389, "end": 409, "text": "(Barber et al. 1990;", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 410, "end": 428, "text": "Saijo et al. 2007)", "ref_id": "BIBREF78"}, {"start": 771, "end": 793, "text": "(Sepp\u00e4nen et al. 1991)", "ref_id": "BIBREF79"}, {"start": 980, "end": 998, "text": "Santos et al. 1992", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 1225, "end": 1244, "text": "(Mauch et al. 1993)", "ref_id": "BIBREF57"}, {"start": 1532, "end": 1556, "text": "(Yoshimatsu et al. 1993)", "ref_id": "BIBREF99"}, {"start": 1695, "end": 1723, "text": "(Rocha-Zavaleta et al. 1997)", "ref_id": "BIBREF75"}, {"start": 1969, "end": 1987, "text": "(Jiang et al. 1998", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 2268, "end": 2280, "text": "(Burke 1999;", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 2281, "end": 2309, "text": "Wald and Ashley-Morrow 2002;", "ref_id": "BIBREF92"}, {"start": 2310, "end": 2326, "text": "Liu et al. 2015)", "ref_id": "BIBREF46"}, {"start": 2492, "end": 2511, "text": "(Jiang et al. 2000)", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 2797, "end": 2815, "text": "(Marx et al. 2001)", "ref_id": "BIBREF55"}, {"start": 3242, "end": 3261, "text": "(Guyre et al. 2002)", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 3518, "end": 3537, "text": "(Osman et al. 2002)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3866, "end": 3890, "text": "(Perelygina et al. 2005)", "ref_id": "BIBREF70"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Application in Humans"}, {"text": "BEVs express products like growth factors, cytokines, chemokines, enzymes, hormones and monoclonal antibodies that can be used for human therapeutic purposes.

Provenge (Sipuleucel-T) is an autologous active cellular immunotherapy that has shown evidence of reducing the risk of death among men with metastatic castrationresistant prostate cancer (Kantoff et al. 2010) . It consists of autologous peripheral-blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), including antigen-presenting cells (APCs), which have been activated ex vivo with a recombinant fusion protein (PA2024). The fusion protein PA2024 contains prostate antigen, prostatic acid phosphatase which is fused to an immune-cell activator called granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor. PA2024 is produced by BEV in Sf21 insect cells. Monoclonal antibody CO17-1A was prepared against colorectal cancer cells by using pFastBac vectors (Park et al. 2011) .

(b) Enzyme and hormonal therapy: Enzyme human adenosine deaminase, a key purine salvage enzyme required for immune competence, has been produced both in Trichoplusia ni and Spodoptera frugiperda insect cells as well as larvae. This enzyme possessed specific activity of 70 units/mg in crude homogenate that is 70-350 times higher than its two most abundant natural sources thymus and leukemic cells. Such biologically active, inexpensive, rapid and huge production of the enzymes by this baculovirus system opens up the avenues for other biologically active molecules. Human parathyroid hormone (hPTH) was produced both in Bombyx mori cells and larvae. Both of the host systems have been reported to be suitable for efficient synthesis and secretion of the correctly processed hPTH (Mathavan et al. 1995) . Similarly, recombinant full length human growth hormone (hGH) was produced in Bombyx mori nuclear polyhedrosis virus (vBmhGH) (Sumathy et al. 1996) . (c) Growth factors therapy: Growth factors are naturally signalling molecules required for myriads of biological processes for which the requirement of consistent, cost-effective and clinically efficient technologies is indispensable. Wound healing is one of such complex biological processes that requires the collaborative efforts of different tissues, cells and molecules. The repair process of wounds after injury is initiated by the release of various growth factors (GFs). GFs act as functional messenger molecules between cells which control the cellular processes in the regulatory network and sometimes require recombinant protein therapies. Currently, wound healing is being focussed on GFs and/or human skin substitutes, required for decreasing healing time by modifying inflammation and accelerating the proliferative phase. The beneficial effects of GFs to attract different kinds of cells at the site of wound healing have been demonstrated by many studies. Wider clinical and commercial applications of such GFs depend on their scalable cost-efficient production. BEVs have been successful in unblocking the bottlenecks for such inevitabilities. Three fully functional human GFs, the human epidermal growth factor 1 (huEGF1), the human fibroblast growth factor 2 (huFGF2) and the human keratinocyte growth factor 1 (huKGF1), have been produced with BEVs in Trichoplusia ni insect larvae (Dudognon et al. 2014 ).

Baculoviruses have been found to deliver genes into a wide range of vertebrate cells and species. However, the exact mechanism of entry of baculovirus in to the host cells is still not fully understood. Recently, phagocyticlike mechanism of entry into mammalian cells was found to be more convincing than pinocytosis (Long et al. 2006) . Baculovirus progeny production occurs in two forms, budded virus (BuV) and occlusion-derived virus that only differ in their envelops. BuV derives its envelop from cell membrane and spreads the infection within host, whereas occlusion-derived virus envelop is derived from nuclear membrane and spreads infection between hosts.

These capsid proteins assemble within BEV-transduced insect cells to produce icosahedral VLPs (Aucoin et al. 2007 ). More efficient rAAVs require co-infection of insect cells with three different kinds of baculoviral vectors. The first one is Bac-Rep, expressing the major AAV replication enzymes Rep 78 and Rep 52 essential for AAV genomic replication and packaging, respectively. Second is Bac-Cap, expressing the AAV virion capsid proteins (VP1, VP2 and VP3), and third is Bac-GOI, expressing the gene of interest flanked by AAV inverted terminal repeat elements required for the rescue, replication and packaging of the heterologous gene. Co-infection with these three vectors in insect cells produces efficiently replicated and encapsulated single-stranded AAV vector genome (Weyer and Possee 1991) . Further enhancement of AAV in terms of stability, robustness, scalability and high-titre production involves both Rep and Cap protein expression from a single baculovirus (Bac-Rep Cap), i.e. expression of both Rep 78 and Rep 52 transcription from a single mRNA and genetic modifications of the original Bac-Rep and Bac-Cap constructs (Virag et al. 2009 ).

Functional lipase is required for plasma triglyceride hydrolysis under normal condition. Inactivated enzyme results into hypertriglyceridemia characterized by frequent abdominal pain and fatty deposits in the skin and retina that in severe cases can lead to fatal pancreatitis, diabetes and onset of cardiovascular diseases. Earlier therapies targeted to lower the plasma triglycerides have not been proved much effective. Alipogene tiparvovec (also known as AAV1-LPL S447X in the early phases of clinical trial) is the first adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated gene therapy manufactured by UniQure that got market authorization and government approval in Europe. It is an AAV1 (serotype 1) vector expressing naturally occurring variants of LPL transgene, LPL S447X linked with improved lipid profile and is commercialized by the name of Glybera (Gaudet et al. 2010) . It is injected through intramuscular route in the patients that results in natural gain of function of LPL gene variants to muscle tissues. Glybera use significantly lowers plasma triglycerides by increasing the lipoprotein lipase enzyme activity. The major concern for using such vector-based gene therapy is to prevent both humoral and cell-mediated immune response elicited against viral capsid proteins that may impact the efficacy and safety of these drugs. Intramuscular injections of Glybera has been proved clinically safe and efficient drug that does not elicit any additional systemic and local immune response harmful for humans. This approach was found to be relevant and promising for the treatment of thousands of single gene disorders. Similar strategies are being investigated in diverse range of therapeutic areas, and many products for the treatment of human diseases are in different stages of clinical development. These AAV gene therapy drugs at different clinical development phases are being discussed here. (b) Haemophilia: It is a blood clotting disorder caused by the mutation in the clotting factor IX gene. Presently, four clinical trials are going on that involve rAAV serotype 2 or 8, designed to express factor IX. Haemophilia A, the most common severe inherited bleeding disorder caused by mutation in factor VIII gene, is significantly more problematic for this treatment because of a larger size of cDNA that prevents in achieving the adequate level of transgene expression and elicits the anti-factor VIII immune response (High et al. 2014 ). (c) Retinal degeneration: Recombinant AAV has been used to treat a number of animal models but is limited by carrying capacity, slow onset of expression and limited ability to transduce some of the retinal cell types from the vitreous. Next-generation AAVs have been produced to address these issues by creation of self-complementary AAV vectors for faster onset of expression and specific mutations of self-exposed residues to increase transduction. Such vectors were further improved for broader applicability and advantageous characteristics by directed evolution through an iterative process of selection (Day et al. 2014 ). Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) that leads to the central vision loss in elderly individuals due to choroidal neovascularization is marked by proliferation of blood vessels and retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells. It leads to photoreceptor death and fibrous disciform scar formation. Treatment of AMD patients requires neutralization of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) for which expression of modified soluble Flt1 receptor was designed and expressed in AAV2-sFLT01 vector. Presently, this study is in Phase 1 trial (MacLachlan et al. 2011) . Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA) is an autosomal recessive blinding disease that occurs due to mutations in RPE65 gene. Subretinal administration of AAV2-hRPE65v2 has been reported both safe and efficient for at least 1.5 years after injection. Currently six clinical trials, either in stage 1 or 2, are going on to treat this retinal disease (Simonelli et al. 2010 ). (d) Neurological diseases: rAAV has been used as an effective gene delivery system for the treatment of central or peripheral nervous system with almost no adverse effects in many clinical trials. First time, its clinical use in the human brain has been used to treat Canavan disease, a childhood leukodystrophy also known as Van Bogaert-Bertrand disease caused by the deficiency of enzyme aspartoacylase (ASAP). It involves neurosurgical administration of approximately 10 billion infectious particles of recombinant adeno-associated virus (AAV) containing the aspartoacylase gene (ASPA) directly to the affected regions of the brain (Janson et al. 2002) . To treat Alzheimer's disease, transfer of gene encoding nerve growth factor (NGF), which is essential for healthier nerve cells, is transduced by an adeno-associated nerve growth factor (CERE-110) (Bakay et al. 2007 ). Transduction of glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) and trophic factor neurturin was assessed successfully in different Phase 1 and 2 clinical trials for the treatment of Parkinson's disease (Marks et al. 2010; Kaplitt et al. 2007 ). (e) Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD): DMD is a severe recessive X-linked muscle disorder caused by mutations in gene encoding dystrophin. Gene therapy to treat DMD is a challenge due to the large size of DMD gene.
