As of November 2020, more than 63 million people have been infected, and approximately 1. 5 2020). In Japan, a large cluster of infections, in which more than 700 people were infected, occurred in a cruise ship in February. Thereafter, the first phase of the epidemic, in which more than 16,000 people were infected, occurred from March to May 2020. After several weeks, the second phase of the epidemic occurred, with a peak in the first half of August, in which more than 80,000 people were infected between July and the end of October (http://hazard.yahoo.co.jp/article/20200207, accessed on 30 November 2020). And then, the third phase started in November. Osaka General Medical Center (OGMC), with a tertiary emergency medical facility, has played a key role in treating patients with severe COVID-19 in Osaka Prefecture, and during each phase of the epidemic, more than a hundred patients with moderate to severe COVID-19 had been admitted. In this study, to confirm the effectiveness of infection protection among hospital workers, blood samples from one thousand hospital staff were collected in mid-July, just at the beginning of the second phase of the epidemic in Japan. The levels of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were measured using a radioligand assay (RLA) and the results were validated using other assays.",

Since N contains 7 methionine residues and T7-tag contains 3, a total of 10 35S-methionine per molecule could play the role of a marker for the protein. In-vitro transcription and translation were conducted using a reticulocyte lysate kit (TNT Quick Coupled Transcription/Translation SystemTM, Promega, Madison, WI, USA) and 35-S-methionine (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA, USA) by incubating at 30 \u2022 C for 90 min and radiolabeled N protein was separated from that with unincorporated 35Smethionine using a column (Nick ColumnTM, Cytiva, Marlborough, MA, USA). Products were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiographed to demonstrate the presence of SARS-CoV-2 N ( Figure 1 ). Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% bovine serum albumin and 0.1% Tween 20 was used for the antigen-antibody reaction. Ninety-six well-containing filter plates (MultiScreenTM, Merk, Darmstadt, Germany) were used as containers of a 50-\u00b5L reaction mixture, including 1 \u00b5L of serum. Resin adsorbing human IgG (Protein G Sepharose 4 Fast FlowTM, Cytiva, Marlborough, MA, USA) was added to precipitate the antigen-antibody complex. After incubation, the precipitate was washed with Tris-buffered saline containing 1% Tween 20 four times in one hour by aspirating the buffer through the filter at the bottom of the wells. After drying, the scintillation cocktail (Optiphase SuperMixTM, Perkin Elmer Life Science, Boston, MA, USA) was added, and radioactivities were counted. the average of the negative samples in the plate, excluding those with high or slightly high values, was considered to have an index value of 0, and the average from three positive controls was determined to have an index value of 8. The mean (standard deviation) index value of negative samples within each plate became 0 (0.2-0.3), and the mean (standard deviation) index value of the three positive samples in all 13 plates tested was 10.13 (0.57), 8 .33 (0.03), and 5.63 (0.54), respectively.

Most of them showed slightly high results with ELISA or CLIA, although many were below the cut-off value of CLIA. When assayed by two or more methods and slightly positive results obtained concordantly, the detected antibodies might be considered as ones attached to SARS-CoV-2 N antigens. Thus, there are two possibilities: cross-reactivity and low titer of the anti-SARS-CoV-2 N antibody.",

Since the sample had been taken more than 10 years ago, it would not be the real antibody against SARS-CoV-2; rather, it might be a cross-reaction of the antibody with a similar antigen. Hence, the slightly high values in some of the hospital staff samples may have been due to cross-reactions. In that case, those having slightly high anti-N titers and normal anti-S titers would not be incompatible.",

Most coronaviruses closest to SARS-CoV-2, which are registered in the GenBank database, are detected from bats. Although MERS, human coronavirus HKU1, and human coronavirus OC43 belong to the same beta coronavirus as SARS-CoV-2, they are less similar in sequence (approximately 50.9%, 35.6%, and 36.6%, respectively). Cross-reactions with similar unknown viruses cannot, therefore, be denied. H\u00f6rber et al. [9] found slightly high values near the cut-off point in one of three patients with influenza A and two of five patients infected with human coronaviruses. Flink et al.

Together with the Italian and American large-scale sero-surveillances cited above, these findings indicate that asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic infected people should be included in the group with slightly high values around the cut-off point. Infantino et al. [3] had previously evaluated the iFlashTM CLIA assay system for SARS-CoV-2 antibody employed in this study and reported that the highest sensitivity with a very good specificity performance was reached at a cut-off value of 7.1 rather than 10.0 proposed by the manufacturers. Similarly, Mairesse et al. [4] suggested a cut-off optimization from 10.0 to 4.86 to obtain maximum sensitivities for the same auto analyzing system.The Ministry of Health, Labor, and Welfare, Japan had conducted sero-surveillance for general citizens in Tokyo, Osaka, and Miyagi Prefectures in June 2020, and reported five out of 2970 Osaka citizens (0.17%) to be positive (https://www.mhlw.go.jp/content/ 10906000/000640184.pdf, accessed on 30 November 2020). In this study, two commercial kits from Roche and Abbott, both using N protein for antigen, were used. Ten citizens were found positive for Roche's kit, 16 were found positive for Abbott's kit, and five were found positive for both the kits. A follow-up study based on neutralizing antibody titration was performed, and only five samples with concordantly positive results had neutralizing antibodies (https://www.mhlw.go.jp/content/000648706.pdf, accessed on 30 November 2020). Since both kits are expected to be highly accurate, samples with high antibody titers cannot possibly be false negatives. Therefore, the discordant samples should have low counts around the cut-off points. Our results regarding neutralizing antibodies being found only in apparently positive samples agreed with the Government's results.One of the limitations of our study was the small sample size of COVID-19 patients. More samples from COVID-19 patients could clarify the distribution of the titers of positive samples. Another limitation was that we could not discriminate low-titer true antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 from cross-reactions. This should be clarified in the future. Because RLA is not automated, the lack of accurate procedures might lead to inaccurate quantitation.",

Ten or more samples showed slightly high counts, along with slightly high values in CLIA, although they were just below the cut-off point, hence suggesting that the antibody was attached to SARS-CoV-2 N. These results were speculated to imply crossreactions or low titers of true antibodies against SARS-CoV-2; their accurate evaluation would be useful for epidemiological surveillance in future. Overall, RLA was confirmed to be an excellent quantitative method for detecting very low titers of antibodies. Informed Consent Statement: Informed consent was obtained from all subjects involved in the study except blood donors because no individual information was linked to the samples.",
