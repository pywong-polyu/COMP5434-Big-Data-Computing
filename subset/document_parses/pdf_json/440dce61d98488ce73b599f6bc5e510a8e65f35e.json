As more data emerges from the UK National Flap Registry we expect there will be growing pressure to provide this service at all units. Logistical challenges continue to affect our service and we are functioning at approximately 65% of the capacity compared with last year. This is likely related to the restrictions that have been put in place to ensure patient (and staff) safety, such as shielding pre-operatively, but has resulted in difficulties populating available theatre lists.",
