Some authors even claim that this is the era of intelligence in machines. AI and BOTs are developed to mimic various human behaviors. The Systemic-Structural Activity Theory (SSAT) is the framework that offers numerous methods of analyzing and optimizing human performance and reducing the number of errors. This paper focuses on how the SSAT methodology can be utilized to develop AI and BOTs. The SSAT analysis of the tasks, their design, and testing can be improved via building a human algorithm of the task performance. Such analysis allows users to choose the most efficient method of task performance that can then be applied to the development of an AI or a BOT. This paper discusses the examples of BOT development and demonstrates the capabilities, utilization, and future applications of the SSAT framework.",

Such technologies as AI and BOTs are two that have currently been implemented to carry out repetitive and mundane tasks. An Internet BOT, in its most generic sense, is software that performs an automated task over the Internet. More specifically, a BOT is an automated application used to perform simple and repetitive tasks that would otherwise be time-consuming, mundane, or impossible for a human to perform.",

Our 2018 book (Bedny and Bedny 2018) presents an extensive study of the efficiency of the receiving orders operation at the warehouse. It demonstrates how the application of SSAT can improve efficiency and reduce the complexity of the task performance. Some results of this research are discussed below.

The described method attempts to apply an ergonomic approach to robots' efficiency to make orderpicking path planning more effective and precise, which would reduce the picking flow time and lower the human physical and mental load. An example considered in this study illustrates that the proposed method can improve the productivity and ergonomic quality of the pick-to-light sequence planning. The AI-based robotic equipment and the computer-aided picking system, which is driven by robots, has a major impact on close collaboration between material handling devices, people, and the environment. It should be taken into account that to satisfy human work and quality of life, the warehouse manager has to balance the workload with time constraints.",
