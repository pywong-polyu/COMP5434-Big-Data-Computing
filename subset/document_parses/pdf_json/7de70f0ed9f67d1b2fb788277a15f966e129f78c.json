We developed a novel SIR based epidemiological model (SIVRT) which allows the country-specific integration of testing information and other available data. The model thereby enables a dynamic inspection of the pandemic and allows estimating key figures, like the number of overall detected and undetected COVID-19 cases and the infection fatality rate. As proof of concept, the novel SIVRT model was used to simulate the first phase of the pandemic in Luxembourg. An overall number of infections of 13.000 and an infection fatality rate of 1,3% was estimated, which is in concordance with data from population-wide testing. Furthermore based on the data as of end of May 2020 and assuming a partial deconfinement, an increase of cases is predicted from mid of July 2020 on. This is consistent with the current observed rise and shows the predictive potential of the novel SIVRT model.",

The total number of cases and recovered patients is unknown as a fraction of the virus carriers do only show mild or no symptoms and hence, escape any diagnostics or could not get tested especially at the onset of the crisis due to a lack of infrastructure and test material. To a lesser extent, the number of cases is likely to be underestimated in countries that did not count deaths outside care facilities. Whereas other countries like Belgium included every fatality that has been tested positive for the virus regardless of the cause of death (https://www.politico.eu/article/why-is-belgiums-death-toll-so-high/). The lack of consistency among testing strategies and case counts prevents the reliable and comparable calculation of simple measures, such as the infection fatality rate (IFR) or the effective reproduction number",

Adaptations and extensions of SIR and SEIR models were published for COVID-19 already (Giordano et al., 2020; Siwiak et al., 2020; Tang et al., 2020) . Such models allow describing the dynamics of mutually exclusive states such as Susceptible (S) which for COVID-19 is assumed to be the entire population of a country, a region or city, the number of Infected (I) and Removed (R) that often combines (deaths and recovered), as well as the number of Exposed (E) for SEIR models. The variables I and R, are often unknown as the number of cases and announced recovered patients only accounts for a fraction of the real values that is dependent on the testing performed within a country. Therefore the numbers of Susceptible and Exposed that equals the total population minus Infected and Removed in SEIR models are also undetermined. Several studies extended the number of considered states in such models to further differentiate between detected and undetected cases (Susceptible (S), Infected (I), Diagnosed (D), Ailing (A), Recognized (R), threatened (T), Healed (H) and Extinct (E)), (Gaeta, 2020; Giordano et al., 2020) or took the severity of the disease into account in relation to the age of the infected person (Balabdaoui & Mohr, 2020; Wu et al., 2020) . However, with an increase in the number of states and parameters describing the transitions between these states, more data is required to calibrate the model, i.e. to estimate the model parameters. Roda et al (Roda et al., 2020) showed that an SIR model seems to better represent data obtained from case reports than SEIR models.",

Note that the model distinguishes between non-detected and detected values. Relevant summary outputs are reported in terms of overall Cases (CasesAct = I + ID + V + VD), Recovered (RCum = R + RD) and Dead (DeadCum = DeadD + Dead). All states are given per day, starting on Feb 28, 2020, resembling Day 0 of the simulations. The number of daily tests (T) is also modelled as a state, but its dynamics are fitted by a polynomial of 4 th order using the polyfit function in Matlab prior to the model simulation. The derivative of the fitted polynomial is then included as balance equation for T. The model contains 8 parameters (listed in Appendix 1, with a representative set of parameter values) describing the transitions between the states, as well as 1 additional parameter per event. An event thereby describes the change of the infection rate constant (kSI) when changing the lockdown strategy. For Luxembourg, the lockdown began on Day 17 of the simulations (resembling March 16, 2020). Concerning the model structure and parameter values, the following rationales and assumptions have been applied: The Susceptible S are infected by non-detected cases with a rate constant kSI and under the consideration of a Monod type saturation for S. It is supposed that detected cases are not contributing to the spreading of disease because of quarantine measures . This could be adjusted in other model versions if appropriate. After a lockdown event (one for Luxembourg on March 16 = Day 17) the value of rate constant kSI can be decreased during the fitting by a factor ranging from 0% to 100% of the starting value. Infected (I) and Detected Infected (I D ) can further transition to Recovered (R) or severe cases (V) and Detected Recovered (R D ) or Detected seVere cases (V D ), respectively. Severe cases (V) can evolve to Recovered (R) or Death cases (D) and Detected Severe cases (V D ) to Detected Recovered (R D )",

This second layer is reached by testing (blue arrows) from the first undetected layer. The overall number of tests is denoted by T.

Depending on the available data, this allows for a more accurate description of the full (hidden) pandemic dynamics and e.g. allows estimating non-symptomatic cases and the infection fatality rate. The model also allows simulating the effect of partial release of the lockdown (deconfinement) in combination with the planned testing.In this work, this is exemplified for the development of the first phase of the COVID-19 pandemic in Luxembourg (until end of May 2020). The cumulative numbers of detected cases (CasesDCum), the numbers of detected death cases (DeadD), as well as the numbers of active hospitalized cases in normal and intense care (as a surrogate for the detected active severe cases, V D ) and the cumulative numbers of performed tests (T) have been collected for the country in a time-resolved manner (Appendix 2). The model has been fitted to these data by repeated parameter estimation and the successful fits were used for simulation and prediction (Methods). The model nicely fits the observed pandemic in Luxembourg(Figure 2). Furthermore, estimates for the dynamic behavior of the non-observed variables are provided along with confidence intervals derived from the simulations of the successful fits. The rather large confidence intervals for some of the variables indicate that there is not yet enough data to fully identify all parameters of the models. This should be improved in the future by incorporating more data during the course of the ongoing pandemic.",

Subscript D indicates detected cases and the ending Cum indicates cumulative numbers of the respective variables, e.g. CasesCum shows the estimated overall cases in Luxembourg (detected & nondetected).Based on the current modelling, the number of overall cases (CasesCum) including detected and non-detected cases as of end of May 2020 is estimated to approximately 13.000 with a large confidence interval (7.000 -25.000). With an overall population in Luxembourg of 626.108, this gives an estimate of around 2,1% of the population (1,1 -4%). This estimate matches the result of the CON-VINCE study which indicated a population-wide infection in 1,9% of the Luxembourgish population in antibody-based testing(Snoeck et al., 2020). As mentioned the results of this study and similar studies in other countries can be used to further consolidate the model and improve its accuracy and predictive power.These model simulations can also be analyzed in terms of the infection fatality rate (IFR, deaths per infection) and the effective reproduction number Rt_eff. The model-based estimates of the IFR are around 1,3% with 13.000 estimated cases and 165 estimated overall deaths. This is in agreement with the Case Fatality Rate (CFR, a surrogate of the IFR) in Korea as calculated on",

Furthermore, based on the model trained with the data as of end of May, predictions for future scenarios can be performed, especially focusing on the (partial) lifting of the lockdown. A partial lifting of the lockdown can thereby result in a renewal of active cases within around 50 days (Figure 5). This matches the timeframe of the rise of cases which is currently seen in Luxembourg as of mid of July. With increased testing as now performed in Luxembourg, this second wave is predicted to stay small compared to the first wave (Figure 6). Adjustments of the infectability of detected cases might be necessary in future model version to quantitatively describe this second wave.",

Initially, Luxembourg performed diagnostic tests based on swabs in the nose or mouth to detect the presence of the virus by PCRs, thereby prioritizing travelers, and their close family circle. Later, Luxembourg could ramp up their testing facility and could test citizen and cross-border workers having a medical recipe. From the 27 th of May to the 28 th of July 2020, 17 drive-in stations were put in place that allowed 20.000 tests per day.

This would allow deriving country-specific numbers of undetected cases in dependency of the applied testing strategies and assess if key pandemic properties like the IFR or RT_eff are comparable between countries. Regularization approaches applied during parameter estimation could thereby help to consolidate significant similarities and differences among countries or regions. Finally, the model could be extended to include the age structure of the population or the geographic repartition of the cases. However this data is often only available later during the pandemic or for few time points, which limits its usefulness. Furthermore, increasing the number of states does not necessarily improve the prediction power of the model as more data will then be required to parameterize it. In general, simpler models should be preferred over complex ones, as at the onset of the epidemic, when the models are most needed, not enough information of sufficient quality is available and hence unknown parameters have to be obtained by model fitting, which increases the uncertainty of the model(Roda et al., 2020). However, these simpler models should still allow capturing the biological realism of the epidemic, which SIR and SEIR models often fail to do. The lack of integrated testing information could result in an inconsistency between i.e. the number of Infected described by the model and the respective available data. Hence without a correction for different testing, model predictions would yield very different IFR and Rt_eff for each country, resulting in a reduced general applicability of such models. The presented testing informed SIVRT model overcomes this issue and shows good predictive potential in this case study for Luxembourg. It thus might is a promising tool for assessing the dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic by incorporating the number of performed tests.Appendix 1: SIVRT model for Luxembourg in IQM toolbox format, resembling the testing data as of May 25, 2020.
