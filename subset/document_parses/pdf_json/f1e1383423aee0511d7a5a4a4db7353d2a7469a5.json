            "text": "Evidence for the real impact of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection on preterm birth is unclear, as available series report composite pregnancy outcomes and/or do not stratify patients according to disease severity. The purpose of the research was to determine the real impact of asymptomatic/mild SARS-CoV-2 infection on preterm birth not due to maternal respiratory failure. This case-control study involved women admitted to Sant Anna Hospital, Turin, for delivery between 20 September 2020 and 9 January 2021. The cumulative incidence of Coronavirus disease-19 was compared between preterm birth (case group, n = 102) and full-term delivery (control group, n = 127). Only women with spontaneous or medically-indicated preterm birth because of placental vascular malperfusion (pregnancy-related hypertension and its complications) were included. Current or past SARS-CoV-2 infection was determined by nasopharyngeal swab testing and detection of IgM/IgG antibodies in blood samples. A significant difference in the cumulative incidence of Coronavirus disease-19 between the case (21/102, 20.5%) and the control group (32/127, 25.1%) (P= 0.50) was not observed, although the case group was burdened by a higher prevalence of three known risk factors (body mass index > 24.9, asthma, chronic hypertension) for severe Coronavirus disease-19. Logistic regression analysis showed that asymptomatic/ mild SARS-CoV-2 infection was not an independent predictor of spontaneous and medicallyindicated preterm birth due to pregnancy-related hypertension and its complications (0.77; 95% confidence interval, 0.41-1.43). Pregnant patients without comorbidities need to be reassured that asymptomatic/mild SARS-CoV-2 infection does not increase the risk of preterm delivery. Preterm birth and severe Coronavirus disease-19 share common risk factors (i.e., body mass index > 24.9, asthma, chronic hypertension), which may explain the high rate of indicated preterm birth due to maternal conditions reported in the literature.",

Rates of preterm birth (before 37 weeks gestation) of up to 30% were reported in early COVID-19 patient cohorts [10, 12] ; more recent systematic reviews estimate the incidence at 15% [8] . Preterm births account for 75% of perinatal mortality and more than half of longterm morbidity; the impact of COVID-19 on preterm labor is a critical concern for obstetricians. Evidence for the impact of COVID-19 on preterm birth comes from series that have reported a high number of preterm deliveries which, however, were indicated (induction of labor or caesarean section) subsequent to worsening of maternal conditions due to severe COVID-19. This has made it difficult to determine the real impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on obstetric outcomes.",

Spontaneous preterm birth was defined as birth before 37 weeks of gestational age because of spontaneous labor or rupture of membranes. Indicated preterm birth was defined as birth following induction of labor or cesarean section for a maternal or fetal indication. Inclusion criteria were: spontaneous preterm birth, indicated preterm birth due to placental vascular malperfusion (pregnancy-related hypertension and its complications, such as hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet count [HELLP] syndrome or FGR). Exclusion criteria were: spontaneous preterm birth with a placental and fetal membrane sample positive for bacterial infection, indicated preterm birth for other obstetric reasons (diabetes, cholestasis, repeat cesarean delivery, multiple gestations, placental abnormalities) or for maternal severe COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2 infection before a positive pregnancy test, inability to give informed consent, and age less than 18 years. Women at full term pregnancy admitted to our Hospital for delivery during the same time period (20 September 2020 to 9 January 2021) were the control group. These women, according to our institutional protocol, had undergone seromolecular testing for SARS-CoV-2 infection at 12-weeks of gestation, at the time of noninvasive prenatal diagnosis, and subsequently at 16 and 21 weeks of gestation. Only women with last menstruation no later than one month after the date of the first reported case of COVID-19 infection in Piedmont (22 February 2020) were eligible for inclusion in the study. This was done to exclude the possibility of COVID-19 seroconversion before pregnancy. This strict recruitment criterion allowed us to define seropositivity in the control group as seroconversion that had occurred during pregnancy.",

Viral RNA was extracted from the NP swabs using a MagNA Pure Compact nucleic acid isolation kit (Roche, Mannheim, Germany) and analyzed using a RT-PCR assay (CFX-96, Bio-Rad, Milan, Italy) with a Liferiver Novel Coronavirus 2019-nCov real-time RT-PCR kit that targets genes N, E, and ORF1ab (Liferiver Bio-Tech, San Diego, CA, USA). Semi-quantitative detection of IgM/IgG non-neutralizing antibodies (nNAbs) against the nucleocapsid viral proteins was performed by automated fluorescent lateral flow assay (AFIAS\u2122 COVID-19, Boditech Med Inc, Gang-won-do, Korea); the AFIAS\u2122 COVID-19 gives semi-quantitative results expressed as a cut-off index (COI), where a COI of >1.1 indicates a positive result. Semi-quantitative detection of anti-S1 and anti-S2 specific IgG neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) was performed using a chemiluminescent immunoassay (Liaison 1 SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 IgG, DiaSorin, Saluggia, Italy); the antibody concentration is expressed as arbitrary units (AU)/mL and grades the results as positive when \ufffd15 AU/mL. Both serologic assays had emergency use authorization. Positive patients were defined as those who tested positive by NAbs or nNAbs or NP swab. Case group women with seroconversion during pregnancy were defined as those who tested positive by NP swab or IgM antibodies or IgG antibodies associated with COVID-19 related symptoms during pregnancy.",

            "text": "Preterm birth rate is not affected by SARS-CoV-2 asymptomatic/mild infection The reported increased rate of preterm births in SARS-CoV-2 infected women does not seem to be related to the spontaneous preterm birth, which is reported to be relatively low (5-6%) and comparable to that of the general population [8, 18] . Evidence is conflicting, however. Data for the impact of COVID-19 on preterm birth have come mainly from case series, observational studies without a control group, and population surveillance systems [10, 19] . Prospective comparative findings are based on a small number of recent studies with composite outcomes [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] . Furthermore, because the rate of preterm birth varies by sampling frames, participant selection, and risk status of the participants, no definitive conclusions can be drawn. Unlike previous studies that compared SARS-CoV-2 infected (cases) and healthy (controls) women and evaluated the incidence of preterm birth in each group, we planned an innovative study design: comparison between women who had a preterm birth (cases) and those who had full term delivery (controls) and evaluation of the incidence of COVID-19 risk factor in each group. Consistent with this way of \"seeing things from a different angle\", we screened cases and controls for variables known to be risk factors for severe COVID-19. We found that the preterm birth group was burdened by a higher prevalence of three known risk factors (i.e. BMI > 24.9, asthma, chronic hypertension) for severe COVID-19 [26] , which are also risk factors for preterm birth [27] . We can speculate that pregnant patients with such comorbidities are at greater risk for severe COVID-19 and consequently for indicated preterm birth because of COVID-19-related maternal respiratory failure. It follows then that the higher incidence of preterm birth reported in previous studies might be related to basal characteristics Table 1 predisposing to the disease rather than actually associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. This higher risk population group should receive intensive and dedicated care pathways once diagnosed with COVID-19, and ideally be vaccinated prior to infection. Since some findings suggest that SARS-CoV-2 infection increases the risk of preeclampsia [28] , the high rate of indicated preterm delivery reported in literature might have been due not only to COVID-19-related maternal respiratory failure but also to COVID-19-related preeclampsia. The placentas of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients often show decidual arteriopathy and other features of poor maternal vascular perfusion similar to placental changes in hypertensive disorders of pregnancy. This is not surprising, because COVID-19 can alter ACE2 expression and lead to a preeclamptic state; SARS-CoV-2 binding to this receptor may cause vasoconstriction resulting from renin-angiotensin system dysfunction. Therefore SARS-CoV-2 infection is thought to predispose pregnant women to severe preeclampsia, even if severe respiratory symptoms are absent [11] . It is unclear whether preeclamptic placental alterations lead to increased risk of preterm birth or aggravation of maternal conditions that would justify indicated preterm birth. A previous study focused on the incidence of preterm birth in women with SARS-CoV-2 infection and healthy patients, used NP swab testing only at the time of delivery and did not include past infections during pregnancy. Hence, the incidence of medically-induced preterm birth because of COVID-19-related preeclampsia could have been underestimated [29] .",

Most SARS-CoV-2-induced placental alterations need time to determine the related clinical outcome. Studies that focus only on active infection with RT-PCR-positive samples [19] [20] [21] [23] [24] [25] may rule out chronic conditions (chronic inflammation or placental vascular malperfusion) that can lead to preterm labor. Furthermore, the use of serological testing alone and not systematically associated to molecular sampling [25] , may lead to the underestimation of those asymptomatic conditions negative for antibodies but positive for RT-PCR at testing.",
