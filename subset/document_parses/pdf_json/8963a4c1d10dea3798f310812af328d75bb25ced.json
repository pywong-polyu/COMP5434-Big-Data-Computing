            "text": "ABSTRACT Introduction Domestic violence and abuse (DVA) is prevalent, harmful and more dangerous among diaspora communities because of the difficulty accessing DVA services, language and migration issues. Consequently, migrant/refugee women are common among primary care populations, but evidence for culturally competent DVA primary care practice is negligible. This pragmatic cluster randomised controlled trial aims to increase DVA identification and referral (primary outcomes) threefold and safety planning (secondary outcome) among diverse women attending intervention vs comparison primary care clinics. Additionally, the study plans to improve recording of DVA, ethnicity, and conduct process and economic evaluations. Methods and analysis Recruitment of \u226428 primary care clinics in Melbourne, Australia with high migrant/ refugee communities. Eligible clinics need \u22651 South Asian general practitioner (GP) and one of two common software programmes to enable aggregated routine data extraction by GrHanite. Intervention staff undertake three DVA training sessions from a GP educator and bilingual DVA advocate/educator. Following training, clinic staff and DVA affected women 18+ will be supported for 12 months by the advocate/educator. Comparison clinics are trained in ethnicity and DVA data entry and offer routine DVA care. Data extraction of DV identification, safety planning and referral from routine GP data in both arms. Adjusted regression analysis by intention-to-treat by staff blinded to arm. Economic evaluation will estimate cost-effectiveness and cost-utility. Process evaluation interviews and analysis with primary care staff and women will be framed by Normalisation Process Theory to maximise understanding of sustainability. Harmony will be the first primary care trial to test a culturally competent model for the care of diverse women experiencing DVA.",

            "text": "Open access or psychological harm, including aggression, sexual coercion and psychological abuse and controlling behaviours. 3 While IPV is the most common form of DVA, other family members, for example, in-laws, can significantly contribute to the abuse. DVA has a particularly damaging effect on women's mental as well as physical and reproductive health. 1 Women victim survivors experience higher rates of health problems, compared with non-affected women, including: physical injuries, chronic pain, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression and anxiety, unplanned pregnancies, gynaecological trauma and death. 4 In 2014-2015, almost two Australian women a week were murdered by an intimate partner. 5 Australia is a culturally and linguistically diverse society with 28% of the population born overseas and almost 50% from a migrant or refugee background. 6 Migrant and refugee families are often impacted by a multitude of intersectional barriers that impact their experience, particularly of DVA. 7 They can face significant hurdles to good mental health and safety-racism, lack of knowledge about Australian systems and services, and the broader challenges of acculturation. Furthermore, rigid cultural norms, stereotyped gender roles, visa limitations and fear of authorities can impact on migrant and refugee community's ability to engage with service providers. 8 In countries where war or social upheaval has recently taken place; few sanctions against DVA exist; and where women have no access to sanctuary, either as refuge or family support, rates of DVA are high. 9 Such countries, including South Asia (SA) countries, represent significant diaspora communities, especially those with young families. Women in these countries report poorer mental health, obstetric and child health outcomes than the nonabused women in their countries. 10 11 Risk factors and approaches to DVA among diaspora communities Surveys of DVA among diaspora communities are few. While none have random samples and use differing samples and measurement tools, some have found similar DVA rates to those in countries of origin. 8 12 Common risks for IPV include low education and employment status and perpetrator alcohol abuse, but migrant and refugee women experience additional risks with poor knowledge of rights and services. 13 14 An effective and acknowledged strategy to reach victims and families is the use of bicultural workers. 15 In Victoria, Australia, women from SA (India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal and Sri Lanka) comprise the largest group of migrants with young families and are disproportionately represented in DVA agency data. 16 With the resulting social isolation, combined with little or no knowledge of available supports, language barriers and different cultural norms, migrant and refugee women experiencing DVA can be at great risk of serious harm and femicide. 17 18 Domestic violence and interventions in primary care Due to greater ill health, victims and their children are over-represented in clinical settings compared with the general community. 19 There is a dearth of evidence for effective DVA interventions in primary care settings. 20 No DVA intervention studies in primary care have specifically addressed the cultural competency of clinicians. Primary healthcare providers are often the only contact with a healthcare professional for a woman who is experiencing DVA. 19 It is common for symptoms of abuse to go unrecognised by healthcare providers. 20 Primary healthcare providers are uniquely placed to identify DVA and provide support.",
