Furthermore, the intelligent research of TCM technology will further promote the improvement in TCM diagnosis and treatment rules and the leaping development of TCM intelligent instruments. In this article, we performed a systematic review of scientific literature about TCM and AI. Moreover, the practical problems of TCM intellectualization, the current situation and demand of TCM, and the influence of AI in the TCM field are discussed by searching for literature using TCM scientific databases, reference lists, expert consultation, and targeted websites. Finally, we look forward to the application prospects of AI and propose a possible future direction of intelligent TCM in the current health-care system in China.",

TCM not only contains herbal plants, but also includes Chinese herbal extracts and minerals. Chinese herbal medicine is considered as an important supplement and substitute medicine in the Western countries as they are generally extracted from natural products with mild therapeutic effects, few side effects, and no artificial additives [10, 11] . Artemisinin is a sesquiterpene lactone drug having a peroxy group extracted from Artemisia annua, so it can be considered a chemical medicine. Tu Youyou, a researcher in TCM, has successfully extracted artemisinin and saved millions of lives around the world and won the 2011 Lasker Award in clinical medicine and the 2015 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. In general, TCM is a medical system whose main content is to study the treatment of diseases and adapt to nature [12] [13] [14] .

            "text": "Western medicine was mainly introduced into China in the 19th century and gradually dominated the Chinese market. At present, TCM and Western medicine are two major schools of medicine in China. e Chinese have realized that TCM and Western medicine have different characteristics and functions, which manage to combine the best practices of TCM with Western medicine [15, 16] . Generally speaking, the characteristics and functions of TCM and Western medicine are reflected in four aspects. TCM usually uses inductive synthesis method, while the Western medicine uses simplified analysis method. TCM believes that the human body is an organic whole and pays attention to individual differences, while the Western medicine pays attention to physiological or medical test indicators. Due to the differences in theoretical basis, TCM tends to observe human pathogenic laws from the aspects of whole, dynamics, relationship, time, nature, and ecology, while the Western medicine tends to observe the laws of human disease from the aspects of local, detail, individual, structure, and material. From the perspective of diagnostic means, TCM takes inspection, listening, smelling, inquiry, and palpation as its basic skills. Although the inspection of Western medicine also includes questioning, listening, and smelling, the most important method is mainly based on medical records, physical examination, and laboratory test results to diagnose disease by modern scientific instruments such as blood analyzer, ECG monitor, etc. TCM focuses on the research objects with the method of system synthesis, while the Western medicine studies the objects with the method of analysis and reduction. Furthermore, TCM takes the overall concept and syndrome differentiation and treatment as the basic point. On the contrary, the purpose of the Western medicine is to clarify the focus of local diseases. In terms of medicine drugs, TCM drugs are natural animals, plants, and mineral medicine, and the Western medicine drugs are mainly obtained by chemical extraction or biosynthesis. To truly integrate TCM and Western medicine, we must first have a correct understanding of TCM and Western medicine and realize that TCM is as scientific as Western medicine. e Chinese and Western medicine are medical science with two different theoretical systems formed under different historical and cultural backgrounds. Only the complementary advantages of the two kinds of medicine can form a unique theoretical system of integrated Chinese and Western medicine. It should be made clear that induction, deduction, analysis, and synthesis are not mutually exclusive and incompatible. Importantly, the TCM and Western medicine should keep pace with the times and constantly move toward modernization.",

Nowadays, AI is widely used in the diagnosis of common clinical diseases in modern medicine. For example, Hirasawa et al. designed a CNN system capable of automatically identifying gastric cancer from a large number of endoscopic images, which is promising in aiding the diagnosis of gastric cancer [23] . Wang et al. summarized the research progress and clinical application value of AI in the investigation, early diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of colorectal cancer, to provide a comprehensive theoretical basis for AI as a promising diagnostic and treatment tool [24] . e combination of TCM and AI began in the 1970s, with the birth of the first international expert system of TCM, which was named \"TCM Guan Youbo Hepatitis Diagnostic and Treatment Procedures,\" as a landmark event. In the decades since, TCM expert system has made progress with the help of clinical practice guidelines, database, and the knowledge of specialists, assisting in standardizing TCM diagnostic models. For example, Weng et al. explored the quantitative diagnosis of the blood stasis syndrome, wherein the changes in tongue bodies of 352 patients of the blood stasis syndrome and 218 patients of non-blood stasis syndromes were observed by the expert system of tongue inspection of TCM [25] . Wang et al. constructed a novel self-learning expert system for diagnosis in TCM by incorporating several data mining techniques, and five representative cases were diagnosed to evaluate the performance of the system [26] . Silva et al. described an expert system for supporting the TCM consultation process both in terms of gathering and managing the patients' personal and symptomatic data, and of obtaining accurate diagnoses and treatments under regulated and reviewed protocols [27] . Nowadays, TCM began to combine with neural network [28] , database, and multimedia technology [29] , and the enrichment of AI algorithms brought new opportunities for the development of TCM. For instance, Zhang et al. proposed an AIbased TCM auxiliary diagnosis system, which can diagnose 187 common TCM diseases and related syndromes [30] . Huan et al. proposed a body constitution recognition algorithm based on deep convolutional neural network, which can classify individual constitution types according to face images [31] .",

At present, the multitype database of TCM has become a solid information for TCM with its abundant data. e TCM stroke prevention database contains data on the treatment of stroke with TCM, acupuncture, and massage from 1996 to 2006. It has established epidemiological information, diseases, syndromes, and other related content and realized the analysis of four categories of factors including clinical research, diagnosis, treatment, and disease relationship as well as the purpose of disease-related data sharing services and data mining. Ai et al. screened the literature on TCM treatment of diabetic retinopathy through the Web of Science, ScienceDirect, PubMed, Google scholar, and CNKI online databases. In addition, they summarized and analyzed the prescriptions, herbs, and identified compounds of TCM on the treatment of diabetic retinopathy from the aspects of anti-inflammation, antioxidative stress, antiangiogenesis, and antiapoptosis [45] .",
