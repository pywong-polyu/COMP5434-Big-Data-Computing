            "text": "A fundamental assumption of learning theories is that the credit assigned to predictive cues is not simply determined by their probability of reinforcement, but by their ability to compete with other cues present during learning. This assumption has guided behavioral and neural science research for decades, and tremendous empirical and theoretical advances have been made identifying the mechanisms of cue competition. However, when learning conditions are not optimal (e.g., when training is massed), cue competition is attenuated. This failure of the learning system exposes the individual's vulnerability to form spurious associations in the real world. Here, we uncover that cue competition in rats can be rescued when conditions are suboptimal provided that the individual has agency over the learning experience. Our findings reveal a new effect of agency over learning on credit assignment among predictive cues, and open new avenues of investigation into the underlying mechanisms.",

            "text": "The ability to predict outcomes of biological significance is essential to fitness and survival. To do so, animals, including humans, must identify which stimuli among the many present provide relevant predictive information 1 ; that is, they must solve the problem of structural credit assignment 2 . A dramatic example of this type of problem is provided by the COVID-19 pandemic, as societies around the world scrambled to ascertain which stimuli posed a risk of contagion and which did not. Failure to assign predictive credit to relevant stimuli (e.g., close physical contact with other individuals, shared meals, enclosed spaces) has led to dire consequences 3 , while misassigning credit to irrelevant stimuli (e.g., 5G mobile networks, mosquitoes, bleach) has likewise fostered maladaptive behaviors 4 . Given the intimate relationship between credit assignment and decision making, it is essential to elucidate how credit is apportioned among cues under various learning conditions. Credit assignment among environmental cues has traditionally been regarded as a competitive process in which the best predictor of the outcome acquires substantial credit over the course of learning at the expense of other predictors 1,5,6 . In support of this notion is evidence that cues compete for credit in a range of tasks 7-10 and species, from C. elegans to humans 11-16 . However, it has also long been known that cue competition is not ubiquitous 17-19 and can be disrupted across multiple learning conditions 20-22 . One such condition is experiencing the trials in massed fashion; that is, separated by an intertrial interval (ITI) that is typically shorter than twice the duration of the cue 23 , as reported in rats 24,25 , pigeons 26 , and humans 27 . This finding has profound implications because in our ever-complex world we are routinely bombarded with information presented in close succession. Diminished cue competition in such situations implies that a host of incidental stimuli may highjack the learning system and wrongfully gain control over behavior. Recently, Reverte et al. 28 reported that granting rats agency over trial presentations protects cue-reward learning from the well-known deleterious effects of massed training 29-31 . Here, we sought to determine whether agency over learning could specifically rescue cue competition under massed trial conditions. To this end, we embedded a trial self-initiating procedure within a powerful master-yoked design that allowed us to vary the degree of agency over learning while keeping the exposure to cue-reward relationships identical 28 . Using a variety of well-established and novel cue competition tasks, we found robust evidence of cue competition only in animals that had agency over learning. Importantly, this effect cannot be explained by differential levels of engagement, general discrimination competence, or ability to process compounded stimuli concurrently. Our data provide the first demonstration of a critical role for agency in how credit is apportioned among predictive cues and open up new lines of neural and theoretical inquiry.",

We first set out to test whether agency over learning rescues the blocking effect 7 from the deleterious effects of massed training in rats (Fig. 1B) . This and the remainder of the studies employed a within-subject design embedded within a between-subject, master-yoked procedure (n = 8; Fig. 1A ). Master rats (Agency group) were allowed to self-initiate their trials by performing a nose poke into a nose port at any point during a period of trial availability (max = 20 s) signaled by a nose-port light 28 . On any given trial, a nose poke would turn on one or more 10-s cues of the visual and auditory modality. In contrast, yoked rats (Passive group) received an identical sequence of events to their master counterparts (including the trial availability cue), but trial presentations were noncontingent on their behavior (i.e., standard Pavlovian conditioning).",

Conditioned responding was measured as the number of anticipatory head entries made by the rat at the dipper recess during the last 5 s of cue presentation 32 (\"Materials and Methods\"). Critically, the ITI was programmed to be only 10 s on average (range 5-15 s). Since Agency rats could forgo trial Figure 1 . Agency over learning rescues competitive credit assignment from the deleterious effects of massed training in a blocking task. (A) Trial structure in this and the remainder of the studies. On each trial offer, a nose-port light was presented in both groups signaling trial availability to Agency rats. A trial-initiating response (nose poke) by an Agency rat immediately resulted in a 10-s cue being presented to that rat as well as to its yoked animal in the Passive group. On reinforced trials, a sucrose US was presented at dipper magazine following cue offset. Trial offers were separated by a 10-s variable intertrial interval (ITI). (B) Experimental design. Letters A and B denote visual stimuli, whereas X and Y denote auditory stimuli. Digits in brackets represent the probability of reward for each trial type. The pretraining phase involved a simple discrimination between A and B. During the compound phase, these trials were interleaved with compounds AX (where A should block X) and BY (where B should not block Y), both continuously reinforced. To test for blocking (i.e., less responding to X than Y), two daily probe trials with X and Y were introduced on session 9 of the Compound phase. (C,D) Behavioral results in groups Agency and Passive, respectively. The left and center line plots depict performance during the Pretraining and Compound phases, respectively. The bar graphs on the right show average responding to X and Y on probe trials across the last four sessions. Conditioned responding is measured as mean number of head entries (\u00b1 SEM). www.nature.com/scientificreports/ offers, the mean ITI was effectively longer (\"Materials and Methods\"), but still considerably shorter than the mean ITI typically used in studies of conditioned magazine approach featuring 10-s cues (in the order of minutes). Both groups underwent two phases of training. In the first phase, rats were pretrained with a simple discrimination involving two visual cues, A and B. Cue A, which would serve as the blocking stimulus in the following phase, was reinforced with a probability of 1 [henceforward symbolized by A(1)], while B was never reinforced [B(0)]. Training continued for 14 days to allow the opportunity for asymptotic discrimination learning (Fig. 1 , Panels C and D, left). A group x session block x cue mixed ANOVA revealed a significant main effect of cue (F (1,182) = 398.24, p < 0.001) and group (F (1, 14) = 8.10, p = 0.013), and a group by cue interaction (F (1,182) = 15.65, p < 0.001). Bonferroni-corrected post-hoc analyses revealed that this interaction was likely driven by the slightly higher level of responding on A(1) trials in the Passive group (t (17.1) = \u2212 3.95, p = 0.006), as both groups significantly discriminated between A(1) and B(0) (Agency: t (182) = 11.31, p < 0.001; Passive: t (182) = 16.91, p < 0.001).",

Specifically, X accompanied A as the stimulus to be blocked, whereas Y accompanied B as the control cue for blocking [AX(1), BY (1) ]. Panels C and D (center) of Fig. 1 show that in both groups the compounds evoked similar levels of conditioned responding as A. A group x session block x cue mixed ANOVA revealed a main effect of cue (F (3, 266) = 187.35, p < 0.001), session block (F (4,266) = 4.28, p = 0.0002) and group (F (1, 14) = 7.07, p < 0.019), and a group by cue interaction (F (3,266) = 10.33, p < 0.001). Bonferroni-corrected post hoc analyses revealed that both groups successfully discriminated between reinforced and nonreinforced trial types In order to monitor the emergence of blocking (i.e., less responding to X than Y), two probe trials with each of X and Y were randomly interleaved daily from session 9 onward (Fig. 1 , panels C and D, center). Inspection of the results suggests that a blocking effect emerged at the end of the compound phase in the Agency, but not the Passive group. This impression was confirmed by a further group x session x cue mixed ANOVA that focused on the mean responding to X and Y across the last four probe sessions ( Fig. 1 , panels C and D, right). This analysis revealed significant main effects of cue (F (1, 98) ) = 7.80, p = 0.006) and group (F (1, 14) ) = 6.42, p = 0.024), and a significant group by cue interaction (F (1,98) = 6.28, p = 0.014). Exploration of this interaction with Bonferroni-corrected simple main effects confirmed a significant difference in responding to the cues in the Agency (t (98) = 3.75, p < 0.002), but not the Passive group (t (98) = 0.20, p = ~ 1). The results thus provide evidence that agency over learning rescues competitive credit assignment to cues from the adverse effects of massed trials.",

This is because X signals a decrement in the probability of reward if considered against the backdrop of A, which is otherwise always reinforced, whereas Y signals an increment in the probability of reward if considered against the backdrop of B, which is otherwise never reinforced.

A Bonferroni-corrected simple main analysis of the interaction confirmed that the Agency group responded significantly more to Y than X (t (126) = 3.04, p = 0.006).

However, X signals a net decrement in the probability of reward when considered against the backdrop of A, whereas Y signals a net increase in the probability of reward when considered against the backdrop of B. Thus, to the extent credit assignment is competitive, Y should evoke more responding than X, but the opposite should be true if credit assignment is noncompetitive. To test this, two daily probe trials with X and Y were inter leaved with training trials, starting on session 13 of the Compound phase.

Conditioned responding is represented as mean number of magazine head entries (\u00b1 SEM). Ruling out alternatives to the role of agency in competitive credit assignment. The results so far can be readily interpreted by assuming that agency over learning simply enhances the animals' attention to task, general discrimination competence, or ability to process compounded stimuli concurrently. To test these interpretations, we compared performance between Agency and Passive rats in a patterning task in which opposite credit must be assigned to compound cues and their constituent elements (Fig. 4A ). One such problem was a negative-patterning discrimination where two cues, a visual (A) and an auditory (X) stimulus, were rewarded when presented individually, but not in compound [A(1), X(1), AX(0)]. A second problem involved a positivepatterning discrimination in which another pair of visual (B) and auditory (Y) stimuli were rewarded when presented in compound, but not individually [B(0), Y(0), BY (1)]. If any of the aforementioned interpretations is correct, Passive animals should find this discrimination particularly difficult. Although both discriminations were trained concurrently, for simplicity's sake we treated them separately when displaying and analyzing the data (Fig. 4, Panels B Taken together, these findings suggest that the deficits in competitive credit assignment previously observed in Passive rats were unlikely due to an inferior level of engagement, ability to solve complex discriminations, process compounded stimuli concurrently, or form configural representations.",

Yet converging evidence indicates that competition is not automatically determined by the presence of other cues, but also by learning conditions such as trial spacing [20] [21] [22] ). Specifically, when information is presented in massed fashion, cue competition is diminished [24] [25] [26] [27] . Here, we provide evidence that granting rats agency over trial presentation can rescue competitive credit assignment from the detrimental effects of massed training. The beneficial effects of agency-often referred to as free (vs. forced) or self-determined (vs. imposed) choice-on performance has been documented in domains such as education 38 and creativity 39 . In the human cognitive literature, agency over what task 40, 41 or what feature of a task to engage with 42 has been shown to enhance performance, and the neural bases of this phenomenon are receiving increasing attention [42] [43] [44] [45] . Our data adds to this literature by showing that the way predictive credit is negotiated among environmental cues is dramatically altered by whether the individual has control over the occurrence of those cues, even when there is no knowledge of the specific cue being presented.",

Firstly, the beneficial effects of agency on competitive credit assignment are not simply the product of a heightened ability to process compounded stimuli concurrently or learn complex discriminations. Evidence for this comes from the superior performance of Passive groups in the patterning task. Secondly, neither can the contribution of background (contextual) cues to competitive learning explain our full pattern of results. While contextual conditioning could summate with responding to the target cues 46 and mask any differences when responding is at ceiling (e.g., Passive group in our blocking study), such masking would not occur when responding is below asymptote (e.g., in our novel cue-competition task studies). Thirdly, our data are likewise difficult to explain by a differential role of eligibility traces in Agency and Passive groups 2 . Specifically, in Passive animals, massed training might allow eligibility traces of recently presented cues to spill over the subsequent trial and contaminate credit assignment. This effect would be weaker in Agency rats if trial-initiating responses serve to precipitate the decay of eligibility traces, essentially fulfilling the role of a long ITI. The issue with this hypothesis is that it also predicts poorer performance for Passive rats in the patterning task, which our data disconfirmed.",

            "text": "Our findings speak to the necessity of incorporating agency into theories of associative and reinforcement learning. This raises the question of what mechanisms might be responsible for the effects observed. One possibility is that agency alters the computation of prediction errors (PE). Recently, various authors have posited that self-determined choices induce a positivity bias in PEs 47 , either because positive PEs are amplified 44 or because negative PEs are discounted 42 . Such an imbalance would give excitatory learning (i.e., cue-reward) the upper hand over inhibitory learning (cue-no reward). To explore this possibility, we conducted a series of simulations of our experimental designs using standard associative theory 5 , inspired by Chambon et al. 47 . We assumed that positive PEs are weighted significantly more during learning than negative PEs under Agency, but not Passive conditions ( Figure S3, Supplementary Materials) . Notably, the general prediction of a greater asymptote of responding in Agency animals was not confirmed by our data, although this may be due to ceiling effects in our dependent measure or differential learning-to-performance functions in the groups. More importantly, our simulations (Fig. S3 ) provided a proof of concept that a PE positivity bias can explain the basic effects we report. In our first blocking study (Fig. 1) , for instance, a positivity bias predicts faster conditioning of the blocking cue A during the Pretraining phase in Agency than Passive rats. Assuming that learning about A is preasymptotic at the end of this phase (asymptotic learning would produce complete blocking in both groups), this cue will be in a better position to block X in the Compound phase in the Agency group. In our third study (Fig. 3) , a positivity bias would readily accommodate the greater level of responding on BY(0.25) trials during the Compound phase in Agency relative to Passive rats, which, combined with the ongoing extinction of B on B(0) trials, would ensure that Y accrues more credit in the former group. Assuming that A blocks X from acquiring substantial credit on reinforced AX(0.75) trials in both groups, this would explain why Agency, but not Passive rats, responded more to Y than X on probe trials. A similar argument could be applied to the results of our second study (Fig. 2) . Therein, Y(1) trials, which were relatively infrequent in each session, may have enjoyed faster excitatory learning in Agency rats, which combined with the inability of X to acquire significant credit (as it is being blocked by A), would yield greater responding to Y than X in those animals. Finally, our simulations also showed that, in accordance with our findings, a positivity bias will disrupt the acquisition of a negative patterning discrimination in the Agency condition, although our data does not show a greater response summation on AX(0) trials as anticipated by the model. Overall, however, the positivity bias hypothesis 44,47 provides a parsimonious account of our results-and one that need not assume that the mechanisms directly responsible for cue competition (e.g., the computation of aggregate PEs 5,6 ) operate any differently in the presence or absence of agency.",

Consider the case of substance use disorders, where drug self-administration is known to mitigate some of the more dramatic and aversive effects of drugs of abuse 59, 60 . In addition to allowing a more accurate prediction of drug receipt, self-administration might also foster cue competition and thereby preclude irrelevant stimuli from contributing to cue reactivity in the future. We speculate that as the sense of agency over drug consumption wanes and drug-related behaviors transition from voluntary and goal-directed to habitual and compulsive 61 , credit assignment might also become less competitive. This transition would exacerbate the individual's vulnerability to drug abuse and relapse by drastically expanding the set of stimuli capable of inducing cue reactivity. Consistent with this, evidence suggests that long-term exposure to potent rewards such as cocaine, heroin, and sucrose undermine competitive credit assignment 62, 63 . In light of such implications, the present findings call for a closer investigation of the role of agency in credit assignment among predictive cues.",

            "text": "All studies used 16 experimentally-na\u00efve, gender-balanced, adult Long-Evans rats, making a total of 64 animals. The age and weights of the rats at the outset of each experiment was as follows. In Exp. 1, rats were ~ 20 weeks old (wo) and weighed 441-516 g (males) and 257-290 g (females); in Exp. 2, rats were ~ 13 wo and weighed 342-388 g (males) and 234-269 g (females); in Exp. 3, rats were ~ 20 wo and weighed 448-529 g (males) and 269-298 g (females); in Exp. 4, rats were ~ 22 wo and weighed 475-554 g (males) and 284-325 g (females). All animals were bred at Brooklyn College from commercially available populations (Charles River Laboratories). They were housed individually in standard clear-plastic tubs (10.5 in. \u00d7 19 in. \u00d7 8 in, Charles River Laboratories) with woodchip bedding. The colony room was maintained on a 14:10 light/dark cycle schedule. Behavioral sessions were conducted between 7-10 h after the onset of the light phase of the cycle. Throughout training, water access was restricted to 1 h/day following each experimental session while food was provided ad libitum. All animal care and experimental procedures were carried out in compliance with the ARRIVE guidelines 64 Apparatus. Behavioral training was conducted in eight modular conditioning chambers (32-cm long X 25-cm wide X 33-cm tall, Med Associates, Inc.). Each chamber was enclosed in a ventilated sound-attenuating cubicle (74 cm \u00d7 45 cm \u00d7 60 cm) fitted with an exhaust fan that provided a background noise level of \u223c50 dB. All reported locations of stimulus and response apparatus were measured from the grid floor of the conditioning chamber to the lowest point or edge of the apparatus. The left wall of the chamber housed two white jewel lamps (28 V DC, 100 mA) mounted on the left and right panels 9.3 cm from the grid floor. Above each of these lamps was a speaker located 20.6 cm above the grid floor and connected to a dedicated tone generator capable of delivering a 2.5-Hz, 80-dB clicker (left panel) and a 70-dB white noise (right panel). Two additional speakers were located on the left and right panels of the right wall of the chamber 24.8 cm above the grid floor. Each of them was also connected to a dedicated speaker capable of delivering a 12-kHz, 70-dB tone (left panel) and a 1-kHz, 80-dB tone (right panel). The right wall also housed a third jewel lamp located on the center panel 17.2 cm above the grid floor. Below this lamp, 4.6 cm above the grid floor, was a circular nose port 2.6 cm in diameter, equipped with a yellow LED light and an infrared sensor for detecting nose entries. This nose port was flanked by a recessed liquid reward magazine (aperture: 5.1 cm \u00d7 15.2 cm) located on the right panel, 1.6 cm above the grid floor. This magazine was equipped with an infrared sensor for detecting head entries, and connected to a liquid dipper that could deliver a 0.04 cc droplet of a 10% sucrose solution. The chambers remained dark throughout the experimental session except during presentations of the visual stimuli. In the same room was a computer running Med PC IV software (Med Associates Inc., St. Albans, VT, USA) on Windows OS which controlled and automatically recorded all experimental events via a Fader Control Interface.",

            "text": "Procedure. Magazine training. Prior to the beginning of each study, rats were first randomly assigned to either the master or yoked group-labeled Agency and Passive, respectively-with the constraint that each group be gender-balanced. Each animal assigned to the Agency group was paired with an age and sex-matched Passive group animal. All sessions began with a 2-min acclimation period in the conditioning chambers. Rats initially received a session of magazine training in which they learned to retrieve a sucrose reward from the dipper cup. This session lasted 62 min and consisted of 60 trials. For the first 10 trials, sucrose was made available for 30 s every 30 s; for the second 20 trials, it was available for 20 s every 40 s; and for the last 30 trials, it was available for 10 s every 50 s. www.nature.com/scientificreports/ Shaping. In all four studies, Agency rats went on to receive five shaping sessions in which they learned to selfinitiate trials, following the procedure developed by Reverte et al. 28 . On the first shaping session, the nose-port light was turned on for a maximum of 20 s, during which a nose poke at the nose port immediately resulted in the termination of the nose-port light and a 10-s period of sucrose availability. Trials were separated by a 10 s variable ITI (range: 5\u221215 s). Failure to respond at the nose port resulted in the nose-port light coming off and the trial being repeated after a regular ITI. Over the following four shaping sessions, we introduced and progressively increased a delay of 2, 4, 6, and 8 s between the rat's response at the port and sucrose availability. During this delay, the nose-port light would flash at a 1-Hz frequency (on for 0.5 s, off for 0.5 s). Concurrently, reward availability was progressively shortened (8, 6, 4, and 3 s). Throughout shaping training (and for the remainder of the experiment), Passive were yoked to their Agency counterparts to ensure that they received the same exact sequence of events and at the same time, except, of course, for the trial-initiation response.",

Agency rats would then be presented with their first opportunity to start a trial as signaled by trial-availability cue (the onset of the nose-port light). The duration of this cue was 20 s, during which a response at the nose port would immediately turn off the nose-port light and turn on one of various possible visual, auditory, or audiovisual compound cues which were always 10 s long. The trial types specified by these cues were selected from a pseudorandom list built with the constraint that no trial type could be presented more than three times in succession. On reinforced trials, the cues' offset coincided with the delivery of a 0.04-cc bolus of sucrose, which remained available for 3 s, after which a short ITI followed (mean: 10 s; range 5-15 s). As during shaping, failure to self-initiate a trial terminated the nose-port light after 20 s and led to a regular ITI period (mean: 10 s; range 5-15 s). Passive rats received the same sequence of events-including the same trial types at the same time and in the same order-as their Agency counterparts, but in standard Pavlovian fashion (i.e., noncontingent on any response). For any yoked pair of rats, a session terminated once the Agency rat completed all scheduled trials or timed out after 90 min. Since Agency rats self-paced their training, they could take breaks that elongated the effective average ITI. Such pauses were of course also applied to their yoked counterparts. Supplementary Table S1 provides the effective ITI durations as well as the total session durations for each experiment. Furthermore, granting agency over trial presentation necessarily entailed the risk that rats would not complete all scheduled trials within the imposed time limit of 90 min, in which case the session would time out. Once again, the use of a master-yoked procedure ensured that this issue affected both groups equally. Supplementary Table S2 Fig. 1 ). In the first, pretraining phase, rats in both groups received 14 sessions of A(1) vs. B(0) discrimination training, where A and B were visual cues and the numbers in parenthesis represent the probability of reward. One visual cue was constructed by flashing the two jewel lamps on the left wall alternately at a 2-Hz frequency (on for 0.25 s, off for 0.25 s), whereas the other was provided by the steady illumination of the white jewel lamp located on the right wall. These cues were counterbalanced, and were presented 48 times each in a session.",

Focusing the analysis on the latter half of the cue has two advantages. First, it provides a cleaner measure of goal-tracking behavior, as sign-tracking behavior-which we did not measure, and which may have differed between the groups-tends to concentrate in the first half of a 10-s cue 32 . Second, it filters out any bias in conditioned behavior resulting from the fact that Agency and Passive rats began their trials at different locations in the chamber relative to the sucrose magazine. Indeed, whereas Agency rats necessarily had their snouts in the adjacent nose port at the time of cue onset, Passive rats were free to roam in the chamber and approach the magazine at all times, compromising any between-group comparison at the start of the cue period.",
