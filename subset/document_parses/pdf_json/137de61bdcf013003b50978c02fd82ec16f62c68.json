Methods: This is operational research by actively involving the community to carry out self-screening through the mHealth application.

To evaluate the potential of community-based self-screening of CVD risk, we use several indicators: responses rate, level of CVD risk, and community acceptance.",

By referring to the EZ-CVD risk score, this mHealth application develops a self-assessment and does not require laboratory testing as early detection to predict CVD risk. Furthermore, Mansoor et al. (2019) argued that the inability to access comprehensive examinations is a major limitation that can result in many patients being missed for CVD risk assessment and receiving recommendations for preventive therapy. A similar study conducted at LMIC showed a slightly higher risk Fig. 2 ) [21] . The results of the analysis of the risk score on the mHealth application meanwhile show a proportion of CVD risk that is more or less comparable to the results of EZ-CVD and ASCVD (see Fig. 2 ) [10, 20] . Even mHealth that is not equipped with laboratory test results has a proportional rate close to ASCVD, which has a high sensitivity for identifying future CVD events of around 80%, with a fairly high specificity (69%) and a positive predictive value (17%) [22] . These findings indicate that at least the mHealth application easily provides CVD risk predictions. In the future, of course, it is necessary to undertake further research to show the extent of the sensitivity and specificity of this application as a tool for the early detection of CVD.",
