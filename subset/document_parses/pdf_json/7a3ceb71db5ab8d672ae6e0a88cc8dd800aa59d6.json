TDI scores were calculated using data from the UK 2011 Census. The TDI score combines information on car ownership, household overcrowding, owner occupation, and unemployment aggregated for small areas of residence [18] . Higher TDI equates to a higher level of socioeconomic deprivation. We computed the quintiles (Q) of TDI, and categorised it as Q1 for the least deprived and Q5 for the most deprived group. Age was calculated from dates of birth to baseline assessment. Ethnicity was self-reported and categorised as white or white British, black or black British, Asian or Asian British, and others, including mixed ethnicities and all other, ethnic groups. Smoking status was categorised into never, former, and current smokers. The WHO criteria were applied to classify BMI as underweight (<18.5 kg/m 2 ), normal weight (18.5-24.9 kg/m 2 ), overweight (25.0-29.9 kg/m 2 ), and obese (\u226530.0 kg/m 2 ) [19]. However, due to data sparsity we recategorised BMI as obese (BMI \u2265 30.0 kg/m 2 ) vs. non-obese (BMI < 30.0 kg/m 2 ). Employment was categorised as employed or self-employed (baseline category), retired, and unemployed or unpaid. Types of cancers were classified as haematological, non-haematological, melanoma of the skin, and other types of cancer. This categorisation was not based solely on clinical characteristics and largely on the number of positive COVID-19 cases per each distinct cancer type (it had to be >20 diagnosed cases). Finally, we included the duration of time following the cancer diagnosis, classified as being diagnosed with a malignant tumour less than five or more than five years ago.",

The overall incidence in our study was 4.7 cases per 1000 incident cancer patients (95% CI: 3.8-5.8). Overall, 4090 (21.6%) participants were in the most deprived category, and 3604 (19.1%) in the most affluent group. The median age of the test positive group was 74 years (interquartile range [IQR], 68-78 years) and 52.8% were male. The majority of them were white (91.0%), while 4.5% were black. 74 of 89 test-positive patients (83.1%) had non-haematological cancer, of which malignant neoplasm of the breast, prostate, colorectal, and urogenital were the most common primary tumour sites (Supplementary Table S1 ). We did not find statistically significant differences between the cases and controls regarding the distributions of cancer types, or the duration of time following the cancer diagnosis. In univariate analysis, black patients had nearly four times higher risk of testing COVID-19 positive than whites (i.e., crude risk ratio [cRR] of 3.77 and 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1. 39-10.20) . Individuals living in more deprived areas had approximately 4 times higher risk of testing positive for COVID-19 than those individuals from the least deprived areas (i.e., the least deprived quintile of the Townsend index (Q5) vs. the most affluent quintile (Q1) was 3.40; 95% CI: 1.56-7.38) ( Table 2) . Furthermore, being unemployed or unpaid, current smoker or ex-smoker, having high BMI, or being diagnosed with haematological cancers were strongly associated with an increased risk of testing positive for COVID-19. In multivariate analysis, we controlled for confounding adding successively one variable at a time in the multivariate regression model (Table 3 ). Our final completecase model (Model 8) found a consistent and independent association between being socioeconomically deprived (TDI Q5) and testing positive for COVID-19, with an adjusted risk ratio (aRR) of 2.52 (95% CI 1.00-6.33). Black patients had almost 6 times higher risk of testing positive for COVID-19 in comparison with white patients (i.e., aRR 5.79; 95% CI 1.88-17.85). Furthermore, this risk among unemployed was two times higher than among employed patients (aRR 2.35; 95% CI 1.06-5.20) and increased by 41% for each 5 kg/m 2 increase in BMI (aRR 1.41; 95% CI 1.20-1.67) ( Based on the risks estimated from Model 8, we predicted the probabilities of testing positive for COVID-19 for the most and least deprived individuals of the studied cohort, given their respective observed distribution of the covariables included in the model. The probabilities are stratified by sex ( Figure 2 ) and BMI (Figure 3 ). Overall, we found a clear deprivation gap, but the figures show no evidence of significant differences in COVID-19 positive tests between men and women. Differences between the two sexes were, however, more pronounced among the most deprived group (Figure 2) . Figure 3 shows a constant deprivation gap in the probability of testing positive between the most and least deprived cancer patients that widens with increasing levels of BMI and even strengthens among obese cancer patients (i.e., BMI > 30.0 kg/m 2 ). Results of the sensitivity analysis are detailed in supplementary Technical notes 1 and Table S2 . The effect estimates for being most deprived were consistent in sensitivity analyses based on controls consisting of either test negative or non-tested participants.

As published by the Office for National Statistics in the UK, the rate of COVID-19 related deaths was 2.7 times higher for black African men then for white men [23] . Thus, we argue that an increased risk of testing COVID-19 positive among black ethnic groups may partially explain the increased mortality risk observed in the UK. Furthermore, the incidence rate in our study (i.e., 4.7 cases per 1000 people) was consistent with the reported figure for the whole UK. The total population in the UK was 66,796,800 (mid-year estimate in 2019 according to the Office for National Statistics of the UK) and the total number of cases as of the 1st August 2020 was 303,942 [25, 26] , corresponding to an incidence rate was 4.6 per 1000 people. COVID-19 incidence was similar in both populations (general and cancer patients) while external contacts were lower for cancer patients. The is likely to be due to cancer patients' caution (\"shielding\"), dramatically reduced delivery of non-COVID-19-related care by the NHS during the first wave of the pandemic, the fear of healthcare interactions during the COVID-19 pandemic or misunderstanding that healthcare services were not available to all but limited to COVID-19 patients only [27, 28] .",

A multi-sectoral approach would reduce disparities by considering the vulnerabilities at a social, educational, economic, and provision-of-care levels. Furthermore, findings from our study may help to prioritise future COVID-19 preventive strategies, especially vaccination priority, among cancer patients undergoing active treatments However, more research is needed regarding comparative risk assessment for COVID-19 infection among cancer and the overall population and the cancer specific survival after COVID-19 infection. UK Biobank has been meticulously tracking the health status of its participants for over a decade. Many participants are now in the age range likely to be most vulnerable to COVID-19 infection as well as at higher risk of being diagnosed with cancer. Using the case-cohort approach we derived risk estimates for positive COVID-19 test results based on a valid and consistent methodological approach [40, 41] . However, there are possible issues around generalisability of the UK Biobank data, which was previously criticised [42] . Although the UK Biobank might not be completely representative of the UK population and therefore the results may not be entirely generalizable, or suitable for identifying disease prevalence or incidence rates, its large size and heterogeneity of exposure measures provide valid scientific inferences of associations between exposures and health conditions that are generalizable to other populations [42] . Furthermore, we were unable to perform cancer specific analysis due to small number of confirmed COVID-19 cases by cancer sites. However, we were able to classify malignancies in clinically relevant categories, i.e., haematological cancers, non-haematological cancers, skin melanoma, and other types of cancers. The classification was not based on clinical characteristics; rather it was based on the number of positive COVID-19 cases per each distinct cancer type (it had to be >20 diagnosed cases).Finally, we assume that controls that were not tested for COVID-19 do not develop the disease which may have induced a selection bias because some of the cancer patients might be asymptomatic [43] . We argue that given their cancer status the majority of control patients developing symptoms compatible with COVID-19 they would have been tested, also we have performed sensitivity analyses demonstrating consistency of results even if non-tested patients were excluded from analysis. Furthermore, in our sensitivity analysis, the results were consistent when restricting the controls to only nontested patients excluding those testing negative on COVID-19 (comparing test positive versus non-tested patients).",
