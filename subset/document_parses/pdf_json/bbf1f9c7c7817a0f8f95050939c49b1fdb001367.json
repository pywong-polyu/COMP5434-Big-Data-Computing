The team of Nanshan Zhong found that 87.9% patients had fever after hospitalization and in 15.7% patients this developed to severe pneumonia [1] . When COVID-19 progresses from severe to critical, patients may develop severe cytokine storm, secondary acute respiratory distress syndrome, followed by shock, tissue perfusion disorders, and even multi-organ failure [2] . Cytokine storm is an important factor in the rapid progression of COVID-19. Therefore, the treatment of cytokine storm is an important part of rescuing severe patients. Currently, there is no specific drug for SARS-CoV-2 and cytokine storm induced by COVID-19. The IL-6 receptor antagonist tocilizumab has been approved by the US FDA for the treatment of cytokine release syndrome (CRS). Since IL-6 is one of the key cytokines involved in infection-induced cytokine storm, the treatment of cytokine storm induced by COVID-19 with tocilizumab has broad prospects. \"Diagnosis and Treatment Plan of Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia (seventh trial edition)\" in China recommends tocilizumab as an immunotherapy drug for critical patients [3] . However, the clinical experience and data of tocilizumab in the treatment of COVID-19 are limited. In this paper, several authors who participated in the treatment and consultation of critical and difficult patients and had specific experience in the clinical application of tocilizumab will explain the role of cytokine storm in COVID-19, the mechanism of tocilizumab in treatment of COVID19 and the key points of pharmaceutical care according to the latest research reports and clinical trial progress, so as to provide reference for the treatment of COVID-19.",

When the human body is invaded by bacteria and viruses, the immune system will release a large number of cytokines [5, 6] .

            "text": "It can be considered that cytokine storm is a kind of over-immune phenomenon produced by the body in response to external stimuli and then an uncontrolled release of cytokines will lead to systemic inflammation. In 1993, Ferrara et al. first proposed the concept of cytokine storm in graft-versus-host disease [8] . Then in 2003 after SARS, the concept of cytokine storm gradually emerged due to the extremely high mortality associated with multi-organ failure [9] . In recent years, chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR-T) cells, as immunotherapy, have used transgenic T cells to attack cancer cells, and have shown remarkable efficacy against previously refractory malignancies. However, patients treated with CAR-T cells produce many potentially life-threatening toxic reactions, and one of the most clinically significant toxic reaction is CRS. The clinical symptoms of CRS involve multiple organ systems, with life-threatening complications including fluid-refractory hypotension and cardiac dysfunction, respiratory failure, coagulopathy, renal and liver failure. CRS occurs because of the high level of immune activation of lymphocytes, macrophages, or myeloid cells with a subsequent massive release of inflammatory cytokines.",

            "text": "A data analysis of 138 hospitalized COVID-19 patients was published in JAMA on February 7, 2020 [13] , and the course of disease was revealed for the first time in the deceased patients. Neutrophil counts, D-dimer levels, blood urea nitrogen and creatinine levels continued to increase in the dying patients, while lymphocyte counts continued to decrease. It was suggested that the virus induced an increase in the number of neutrophils caused by cytokine storm, leading to clotting activation, hypoxia, shock, and acute kidney injury. These pathological mechanisms may be closely relevant to the death of COVID-19 patients [14] . A number of recently published articles have analyzed the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients, and consistently found that the lymphocyte count was significantly reduced in patients with pneumonia, especially those with severe pneumonia, while numerous cytokines (such as IL-6, IL-10, IL-2 and TNF and IFN-\u03b3) were significantly increased, and pointed out that the high levels of IL-6 and other cytokines in vivo were the main cause of the cytokine storm [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] . Jing et al. studied the lymphocyte subsets and cytokines in peripheral blood of 40 patients with COVID-19, and found that the T cell count and cytokine levels of the survivors with severe infection gradually recovered to the same level as those with mild infection in the following time points [17] . As an inflammatory trigger IL-6 was highly expressed in patients with COVID-19, and could induce the differentiation of B lymphocytes and the production of antibodies, and also participate in the immune response of the body by inducing the proliferation and differentiation of T lymphocytes [18] . The team of Haiming Wei showed that after the SARS-CoV-2 infection, CD4 + T lymphocytes were rapidly activated to become pathogenic Th 1 cells and generate GM-CSF, etc. The cytokines environment induced inflammatory CD14 + CD16 + monocytes with high expression of IL-6 and accelerated the inflammation. These aberrant and excessive immune cells might enter the pulmonary circulation in huge numbers and play an immune damaging role in leading to lung functional disability and quick mortality [19] . IL-6 is also considered to be a key mediator of CRS. Thus, targeted drugs that inhibit IL-6 can block CRS or cytokine storm [20] .",

            "text": "The mechanism of tocilizumab in the treatment of COVID-19 remains unclear. According to previous studies, IL-6 is secreted by almost all stromal cells and immune system cells, such as B lymphocytes, T lymphocytes, macrophages, monocytes, dendritic cells, mast cells and other non-lymphocytes, such as fibroblasts, endothelial cells, keratinocytes, glomerular mesangial cells and tumor cells [23] . Under normal circumstances, the level of IL-6 in the body is very low, and it can be quickly synthesized to strengthen the body's defense function when there is an infection or injury. Excessive release of IL-6 can cause CRS, and the more severe the CRS, the higher the serum peak concentration of IL-6. IL-6 binds to its receptor IL-6R to form a complex, and then binds to the signal transducer glycoprotein 130 (gp-130) to initiate signal transduction and trigger downstream signal transduction and gene expression. IL-6R exists not only in membrane-bound form (mIL-6R), but also in soluble form (sIL-6R). In the classical signal transduction pathway, IL-6 binds to mIL-6R to form a complex, and then binds to gp-130, causing downstream reactions, such as anti-inflammatory effects, that are limited to such cells that express mIL-6R. In the trans-signaling pathway, IL-6 forms a complex with sIL-6R and gp-130, which initiates intracellular signal transduction in the absence of mIL-6R, and the pathway has inflammatory effects [24] . The next steps were to induce the synthesis of acute reactive protein through two completely different signaling pathways. One IL-6 signaling pathway is mediated by the JAK/STAT tyrosine kinase system, while the other is mediated by the Ras/mitogenactivated protein kinase (MAPK)/NF-\u03baB-IL-6 pathway. The former is a major pathway [25, 26] .",

However, when the level of IL-6 increases, IL-6 signal is widely expressed, because gp-130 is everywhere. In this way, IL-6 trans signaling via the sIL-6R can activate virtually all cells of the body and then regulate pro-inflammatory reactions. Blocking of trans-signaling was effective in a variety of preclinical chronic and autoimmune disease models [28] . Tocilizumab, which is a humanized anti-IL-6R monoclonal antibody, can bind to both mIL-6R and sIL-6R and then inhibit classical and trans-signals. This may be its potential mechanism for the treatment of cytokine storm in COVID-19 (see Fig. 1 ).",

It is not yet possible to predict drug-related birth defects and the risk of miscarriage. In animal reproduction studies [32] , intravenous administration of tocilizumab during organogenesis in cynomolgus monkeys may result in miscarriage or stillbirth at doses higher than the maximum recommended dose of intravenous administration of 8 mg/kg every 2-4 weeks. Animal experiments have shown that inhibition of the IL-6 signal may interfere with cervical maturation, expansion and contraction of the uterine muscle, which may be potentially dangerous to the fetus [32] .",

Currently, the usage and dosage of tocilizumab for COVID-19 are still being explored. The clinical use of tocilizumab can be referred to drug instruction from the US FDA for the treatment of CRS or \"Diagnosis and Treatment Plan of Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia (seventh trial edition)\" in China. Be aware of the risk of serious infection, neutropenia or thrombocytopenia, and liver damage caused by tocilizumab. There is no need to adjust the dose of tocilizumab in patients with mild or moderate renal insufficiency, and the data of using tocilizumab in pregnant women and patients with liver injury are insufficient.",
