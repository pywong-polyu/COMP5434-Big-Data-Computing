Outbreaks of diseases such as Ebola, meningitis, Lassa fever, cholera, yellow fever, and malaria have at one point or the other ravaged the continent. Many of these have been successfully curtailed with occurrences in limited geographic areas. For instance, in 2014, the Ebola virus disease affected some countries in West Africa (WA), especially Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone. Lassa fever is also almost a yearly occurrence in some parts of WA [1] . However, the impact was localized in the areas of prevalence. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID- 19) , which is also an infectious disease, was first identified in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, and has since spread globally [2] . COVID-19 was declared a global pandemic on March 11, 2020 , by the World Health Organization [3] .",

It is capable of increasing morbidity and mortality rates leading to substantial economic, social, and political disturbances. The tendency of pandemic occurrence might be due to climate change as well as increased urbanization and globalization. Thus pandemics will always occur as long as humans and infectious pathogens coexist. Proactive measures through national and international policies have focused on COVID-19 is disrupting some agricultural activities and supply chain in WA. The cropping system in WA is mainly rainfed and rain had just commenced when COVID-19 broke out in the region, when majority of crop farmers were planting. Currently, inputs (planting materials, agrochemicals, and fertilizers) are scarce. Livestock and fish farmers are badly hit due to the lockdown particularly in the marketing of produce due to food stores, hotels, and shopping malls that are shut. This reduces cash flow among the food vendors and farmers, thereby discouraging farmers from continuous production. Similarly, there are disruptions in supply chains because of transportation problems and other issues. COVID-19 is an unprecedented challenge for WA; its large population and the economy's dependence on farming make lockdowns and other social distancing measures hugely disruptive.",

Such instances are the efforts in India where the government put in place measures to lessen the impact of COVID-19 on the country [10] . The efforts included a 21-day national lockdown with some exemptions for farm operations, protecting farmers by regular testing and ensuring they practice social distancing, ensuring farmers have continuous access to market and the needed inputs, adding farmers and agriculture workers to government assistance packages, ensuring that the supply chain functions effectively, among others. In the United States, Reidy et al. [11] indicated that the agricultural industry was labeled as critical and allowed to operate under increased hygienic operations despite lockdown. In addition, major agribusinesses were allowed to operate under stricter hygienic and sanitary conditions. In Europe, flour millings are working flat out to satisfy demand [11] . According to the report of the World Economic Forum [12] , COVID-19 is worsening food insecurity in Africa; in that, lockdown measures have hampered internal food supply chains stopping production, locust swarms have destroyed crops especially in Eastern Africa, and the availability of food for import from other continents has been reduced. Furthermore, the World Food Programme [13] reported that COVID-19 will negatively affect the economic sectors (especially agriculture, extractive industry, and tourism), migrant remittances (very important income sources for households), and subsistence farming and inputs for the same in WA and Central Africa. A study conducted by Deguenon et al. [14] on the knowledge status and potential impact of socio-economic factors on the spread of COVID-19 in WA countries found a sharp decline in the use of public transport and an increase in the price of hydroalcoholic gels.",

We also want to propose policies and provide scientific measures that can be adopted to address these disruptions and mitigate such future occurrences in case other pandemics or such issues arise in the future.

However, in case of a similar problem conditional on a third nominal variable, the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test [15] is more appropriate, hence its use in this study. In fact, the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test investigates the null hypothesis that two nominal variables are conditionally independent in each stratum, assuming that there is no three-way interaction [15] . The test rejects the null hypothesis at a level of significance if the P-value of the test is less than a (set to 0.05). This test requires that the sample size in each stratum must be greater than unity. We used the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test to determine whether there is conditional independence between either effectiveness of lockdown at farmers' locations or farmers' preparedness for current COVID-19 crisis and the impact of COVID-19 and lockdown policies on farm or business revenue.",

Most of the respondents were men, 91.24% and 77.98% from Ghana and Nigeria, respectively. The higher number of men than women might be attributed to the fact that men who are involved in agriculture are more educated than their female counterparts and thus have access to social media, which was the major channel through which the data for the study were collected. The same reason can also be offered to explain why respondents were mostly aged between 31 and 40 years: 51.55% in Ghana and 39.45% in Nigeria. Fig. 11 .2 presents the distribution of respondents in both Nigeria and Ghana based on some parameters, which include gender, age groups, status of lockdown, preparedness of respondents, and rating of impact of COVID-19 crisis on respondents' farm or business revenue. It is observed from Fig. 11 .2 that 86.5% of the total number of respondents are men while 13.5% are women and 67.1% of the total number of respondents are at most 40 years old. About 53.6% respondents' farm locations are under lockdown policies, while there is no lockdown policy in 46.4% of the respondents' farm locations. It is also observed that 65.5% of the respondents are not prepared for the COVID-19 crisis in their farm locations, while 34.5% claimed they are prepared for the crisis in their locations. Similarly, 82.6% of the respondents experienced at least the negative impact of COVID-19 crisis and lockdown policies in their farm or business revenue, while 8.9% of the respondents could not infer whether their farm or business revenue were positively or negatively affected by the COVID-19 crisis and lockdown policies. The ratings of the impact of COVID-19 and lockdown policies on respondents' farm or business revenue based on age distribution of the respondents in the two countries are summarized in Fig. 11 .3. More than 80% of respondents in each country were negatively or very negatively affected by COVID-19 and the lockdown policies, irrespective of the country. Very negatively affected respondents were relatively more common in Nigeria than in Ghana (Fig. 11.3) . Interestingly, 4.2%e12% of respondents were positively to very positively impacted in both countries for all age groups. None of the respondents older than 50 years were positively to very positively impacted in Ghana. Many of the respondents in Nigeria and Ghana, across all ages and gender, were negatively affected by COVID-19 and lockdown policies. The negative effect was relatively more common in Nigeria than that in Ghana. Interestingly, a few respondents still had some positive impact of the situation on their business. A higher proportion of women were positively affected in Ghana than men. The chi-square test of independence shows that the ages of respondents do not influence the impact of COVID-19 and lockdown policies on respondents' farm or business revenue (P-value \u00bc .475) in Nigeria. Similarly, no association between these variables was detected in Ghana (P-value \u00bc .163). That is, the ages of the respondents and the opinions of the respondents in the two WA countries on the impact of COVID-19 and lockdown policies on respondents' farm or business revenue are dependent on each other. The ratings of the impact of COVID-19 and lockdown policies on respondents' farm or business revenue based on the gender of the respondents in both countries are shown in Fig. 11 .4. For both genders, most of the respondents were either negatively affected or very negatively affected in their farm or business revenue by COVID-19 and lockdown policies irrespective of their countries. However, there were more respondents from Nigeria who were very negatively affected than in Ghana.",

The high number of youth could be attributed to the recent involvement of youth in agriculture because of unemployment, insufficient white-collar jobs, and government/NGO incentives [17] . _ It can also be due to the fact that younger people have more access to social media, which is the major channel through which the data were collected during this study. Many of the respondents in both countries, across all ages and gender, were negatively affected by COVID-19 and the lockdown policies. On a general note, majority of the respondents claimed that the current COVID-19 crisis was not well prepared for in their farm and farming business. This is worrisome because it threatens food security in the region and aligns with the earlier prediction of food insecurity as a result of COVID-19 [12, 13] . The study also revealed that being either in the location where lockdown is applied or not does not affect the impact of the lockdown on their activities. The negative effect of COVID-19 was relatively more common in Nigeria than in Ghana. Interestingly, a few respondents still had some positive impact of the situation on their business. A higher proportion of women were positively affected in Ghana than men. The fact that none of the older farmers (older than 50 years) were positively impacted in Ghana might be attributed to inadequate awareness of COVID-19 among this group of farmers, that planting season has just begun in WA, or that due to their relatively old age, they are relatively less involved in agricultural activities and consequently did not feel the impacts of the epidemic as the other respondents.",

Generally, the impact of COVID-19 with respect to gender in this study revealed that most respondents were either negatively or very negatively affected. Ghanaians were mostly affected negatively, while most Nigerians were very negatively affected. The negative impact among Ghanaians and Nigerians was higher in men than in women. A higher proportion of women in Nigeria were very negatively affected by COVID-19 than men; this was quite similar for both men and women in Ghana. In Ghana and Nigeria, agriculture (farming) and its related activities are highly gendered, mostly dominated and controlled by men [18e22], partly due to culture and gender recognition. Wilbers [18] reported that the patrilineal inheritance in Ghana limits women's access to land acquisition and control of farm produce. Ogunlela and Mukhtar [21] stated that in Nigeria, women constitute a larger (60%e80%) share of the agriculture labor force but have limited access to land, inputs, labor, and extension services. It must be noted that both men and women make significant contributions to agriculture and its related activities needed to ensure food security of the family. In this study, a higher proportion of women than men were positively affected by COVID-19 in Ghana. Also in Nigeria, a higher proportion of women than men were very positively affected. These findings suggest that women in agriculture and its related activities have better adaptative strategies to pandemics than men in the same. It has been indicated that in most rural communities in sub-Saharan Africa, the roles of women, especially in agriculture and rural economy, cannot be overemphasized [20] . Their roles range from producing, trading, and processing of crops and animals and maintaining and caring for their homes and family members, among others. Despite this, women have no or limited role to play in decision-making processes regarding agriculture development [21] . Howbeit, recognizing the role of women in agriculture is very important in promoting food security and resilience agriculture to combat future pandemics, especially in the food supply chain. Futhermore, older people, especially smallholder farmers, might be more vulnerable to the impact of lockdown policies because their farming activities are mostly oriented toward subsistence and any disruption might have important negative feedback on their activities [23] . Our study indicated rather no significant differences across age categories with respect to the impacts of COVID-19 and lockdown policies on their farm or business revenue. Futher analyses should consider the agricultural sector in which the respondents are operating and the size of their exploitation (small, medium, or large) to provide better insights of the epidemic impacts.",

Evidence of this is seen in the rise in the cost of some food items across WA. Similar reports were reported [13, 14] . A study [24] across some Asian countries reveals the same trend. Some of the negative impacts of the pandemic and the consequence of the lockdown policies include disruption of agricultural activities and supply chains, produce distribution issues, change in domestic demand, and stoppage of night farmers' markets. It was envisaged that the agricultural community will face acute shortage of inputs such as fertilizer, seed, feed, and pesticides if the pandemic continues for an extended period. This will affect the replenishment of food stocks in exporting countries and on local farms. Invariably, potential shortages of labor for farming and food processing due to measures to limit the spread of the virus may occur [24] . This calls for attention not only in WA but also all over the world. Some efforts have been exerted in this regard [25, 26] . One such effort is that of the United Nations [25] entities working closely with national governments, community groups, the health sector, and the health industry to respond to the crisis of strains placed on health systems, essential public services, and communities globally by the pandemic. Another significant response, especially focused on gender-sensitive response to the negative impact of COVID-19 on agriculture and food security, is the effort by the International Food Policy Research Institute to involve researchers and professionals in a virtual discussion [27] . Some of the response efforts suggested by Hossain [24] include recommendation of group purchases and farmers' markets. This is expected to assist farmers and grain producers to promote diversified products, improve the efficiency of transportation, and lengthen the shelf-life of vegetables and fruits.",
