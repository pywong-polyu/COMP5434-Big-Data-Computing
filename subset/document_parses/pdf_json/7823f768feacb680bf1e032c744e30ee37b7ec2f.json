However, the additional workload for the IM departments' medical and nursing staff led to a rapid decrease in morning discharges, returning to pre-intervention rates. Throughout the period of the new throughput intervention, morning admissions increased from 30 to > 70%, and were sustained. The number of patients in each department increased from 36 to 38 to a new steady state of 42-44, included constant hallway housing, and often midday peaks of 48-50 patients. Mean length of stay did not change. IM physician and nurse dissatisfaction led to increased number of patients being admitted during the evening and night hours and fewer during the morning.",

This data is not controlled for variables such as age, diagnosis, and functional status [1, 2] . In addition, the MOH financially penalizes hospitals that increase bed numbers in relationship to the national population growth rate, without factoring in the growth in the significantly increasing elderly population and the rising burden of chronic disease. The result of this policy has been a > 100% bed occupancy rate almost nationwide in internal medicine (IM) departments, overcrowding of emergency departments (ED), and a decreased incentive to build additional departments or add beds. While this is a nationwide problem, the capacity strain at the Shaare Zedek Medical Center (SZMC) has been exceptional [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] .",

After making observations in our ED and analyzing occupancy and admission data, the consultants recommended that there be an increase in patients admitted by 11:00 am, as this coincided with peak ED occupancy. This led the hospital's management to experiment with a quality improvement (QI) intervention, i.e., transferring a large number of patients from the ED to the IM departments by 11:00 am according to a specified formula without regard for bed availability in the departments.

The general ED has 45 beds with a surge capacity up to 120 beds, and services 90,000 patient visits per year (pre-Covid-19). The IM division consists of three general medical departments (A, B, and C), each staffed to take care of 36 patients, a smaller 22-bed medical department (D) for short admissions originally situated next to the ED, and a 39-bed acute geriatric department [9] . During the study period, only a marginal number of beds (less than 5) were added to the IM division, which were not expected to have a significant influence on the outcomes of the new intervention. In addition, there is a medical \"observation\" unit in the ED taking care of the overflow of medical patients for whom no bed is available, mainly consisting of high-functioning patients with expected admissions spanning less than 48 h. Oncology and Cardiology are separate departments, not part of the IM department. The data analyzed and collected included demographic data of patients entering the ED and being admitted to the IM departments over 5 years, starting 2 years prior to implementation (2014-2015) of the new admission intervention and subsequently throughout its 3-year course (2016) (2017) (2018) .

This does not include patients admitted to geriatrics, cardiology, or hematology-oncology. Demographic data of the patients admitted to the IM departments are shown in Table 1 . Although the majority of patients arrive from the ED, an additional 10-20% of patients were transferred from other departments. Over the timeline of this study, there remained a significant similarity of patients admitted to IM departments A and B, as indicated by comparable mean age, median and mean duration of stay, as well as mortality rates. IM department C moved from its original location next to the ED to its current site next to IM department A and B on the eighth floor at the end of 2017, upon which its patient demographics changed rapidly; specifically, the mean age increased from 68 to 77 years, median length of stay from 3 to 4 days, and mortality from 3.7 to 8.5%, nearly closing the gap with IM departments A and B. IM department D, consisting of 22 beds, was located in a small hospital in down-town Jerusalem. IM department D was closed at the end of 2017 and reopened in the space vacated by IM department C. For IM department D, the mean age of its patients in 2018 was younger than the other medical departments, median LOS was 3 days, and they had a 3.3% mortality rate. While containing about half as many beds as the other medical departments, IM department D's number of annual admissions equaled that of the other departments due to a rapid turnover of patients.",

As mentioned, the first stage (June 2014-January 2016) consisted of a major organizational effort in the medical departments to increase morning discharges. Prior to this study, IM department physicians would round on admitted patients in the morning, discharge patients after noon, and admit new patients in the afternoon and evening. Starting in June 2015, morning discharges increased from a baseline 4% (of all patients discharged during the 24-h day) to 18%. During the morning hours, a nurse supervisor would also circulate in the IM departments to assist the staff and troubleshoot any logistic challenges possibly preventing timely discharges that day. However, cleaning the discharged patient beds and rooms, along with other demands on the nursing and medical staff would prove this increase in morning discharges unsustainable. With time, discharge rates decreased, prohibiting the desired transfer of 15-20 patients every morning to the IM departments. Accordingly, the second stage was initiated.",

The number of patients present in each department at 7:00 am increased from a previous steady state of 36-38 to 42-44 patients. Peak daily number of patients became 45-50.

Exposure to over-crowded conditions in the ED has been shown to be associated with delays in care, decreased patient satisfaction, increased hospital LOS, and increased short-term mortality. Various strategies have been tried to improve throughput including ambulance diversion [11] , a nurse navigator [12] , a high turnover unit [13] , and hold-over admissions [14, 15] -all of which are currently being assessed at our hospital. Nonetheless, ED boarding is endemic and increasing in our institution and elsewhere throughout the western world. In order to control the amount of money that the HMOs spend on the purchase of hospital services (such as hospitalizations, procedures, etc.) and in order to prevent a dramatic increase in hospital services utilization, Israel created an economic mechanism more than two decades ago aimed at managing this process. The mechanism requires hospitals (service providers) to give discounts to the HMOs (service buyers) when the cost of services purchased (i.e., the HMOs) exceeds the amount they spent in a previous period. Typically, the comparison point is the average amount of service costs in the preceding three years. It should be noted that this mechanism may create a lack of incentive for the HMOs to prevent hospitalizations or create alternative services in the community.",

This policy discourages referrals, and also aids in creating an impetus to develop community-based medical services and infrastructure (e.g., community emergency centers, call centers, and tele-medicine capabilities) to try and limit ED referrals. In contrast to the ER reimbursement policy, HMOs do receive a significant (up to 80%) discount for patients that are admitted to IM in cases where there is an increase in hospitalizations in the IM department compared to previous years [16] . This annual offset mechanism attempts to bridge financial gaps from year to year, as well as increase efficiency in the HMO's.

The secondary purpose In fact, on some days, the IM departments actually receive as many, or more, admissions than the number of patients discharged. While it was thought that resultant hallway admissions and crowding could be an \"incentive\" to increase patient discharge rate, this was not the case. Admitting a fixed number of patients to the IM departments regardless of bed availability was eventually associated with a decreased rate of discharge. This was probably multifactorial, to include lack of true incentive, observed overall increase of admissions to the ED over time, a intervention that effectively obviated the need for communication between the receiving IM department and ED, and system fatigue.",

However, early in the study period, it appeared that the IM departments were unable to absorb the necessary number of patients determined by the prescribed formula. Consistent with our findings, the Israeli Ministry of Health published a report on emergency department admissions during 2017 (overlapping our study) (Fig. 4 ) [17] . SZMC demonstrated the greatest percentage of morning admissions from the ED to IM. In addition, this figure reflects the effect of ED overcrowding at other Israeli hospitals, not attempting the SZMC intervention. Even though peak admissions to the ED are during the evening hours, most Israeli hospitals admit patients to the hospital departments 24 h a day. The message to glean from this report is that the challenges we are witnessing with the present system are systemic. Over time, the number of patients getting admitted to IM and leaving the ED in the morning hours decreased. The median IM length of stay was unchanged during the study period. However, outlier patients remained in the hospital for a significantly longer period of time. This observation speaks to the more flexible discharge culture of our hospital, the lack of appropriate placement options and beds in the community, and the impact of significantly exceeding department occupancy rates. The data show that the main impact for the IM departments was an increase in number of patients taken care of by the department teams, from a daily mean of 36-38 patients to 42-44. Furthermore, about 80% of all admissions to each medical department were in the morning hours, in addition to which each department received transfer patients from other departments. The medical or nursing teams did not increase in size, so the workload per staff member increased. Physicians responded by breaking up their teams. Instead of rounding together, allowing for discussion and teaching, each resident and intern was assigned a number of patients, with the attending physician overseeing their work. This fragmented care came at a cost of meaningful clinical interaction and learning opportunity, and increased dissatisfaction among physicians at all levels of seniority. The situation for the nurses was more complicated as the number of patients increased during the study to a peak ratio that strained the ability to deliver consistent high-quality care. In addition to the growing number of seriously ill patients per nurse, there was a dramatic increase in time each nurse has to spend on computer data entry (as result of MOH and Joint Commission accreditation requirements), leaving less time for patient interaction, leading to increased dissatisfaction.",

This biased selection process leaves the youngest and least ill in the ED, of whom a significant proportion will be discharged within 24-48 h.

This has led to the accumulation of patients in IM departments waiting for placement.

In addition, SZMC is burdened with the largest aged population in country [18] . Not unexpected, hospitalization LOS at SZMC is longer than most of Israeli hospitals. Jerusalem is also home to the largest aged population in Israel and is expected to be so for years to come (Fig. 5) . These demographics coupled with the significant lack of community healthcare beds only compound the problem of overcapacity within the hospital.

In spite of initial expectations, the intervention did not contribute to a very significant outflow of patients from the ED, in particular in the morning hours. The initially larger number of patients leaving the ED gradually decreased IM bed availability. IM departments reached a new steady state, taking care of a mean of 42-44 patients (peaking at the middle of each day at 48-50) rather than 36-38. It remains to be determined whether the larger number of patients per staff member leads to decreased efficacy, although some observations raise concerns about quality of care and patient safety. In addition, SZMC started to actively solicit patient experience feedback only since 2021. Therefore, we were unable to assess patient satisfaction during the study. The concerns that the intervention did not realize its major goals, in addition to physician and nurse dissatisfaction, led to a set of corrective measures. First, the admission formula was changed to reduce the number of morning admissions and increase the number of afternoon and evening admissions. Second, IM Department D was moved from its site next to the ED to a full-size department next to the other three medical departments. Finally, a larger ED is being planned along with the addition of a full-size short-admission department. Hospital administrators need to demand system changes, some of which are suggested as policy targets in Table 2 , that can only be implemented by the MOH [20] .",
