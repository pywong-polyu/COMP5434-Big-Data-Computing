Moreover mine structure is full of twists and turns with long-walls. Excavation process makes a mine structure dynamic. Due to mining operations, accidents like explosion, roof fall (common in underground mines), and landslides (common in opencast) are very frequent in occurrence in a mine thus endangering life of miners. For faster response to any untoward event, proper communication connectivity inside the mine, among the miners and also with above the surface personnel is very important. Safety measures like proper exchange of information regarding the environmental conditions, and transmission of position-based information of the miners during emergency [4, 5] , should be considered. This will also help in improvement of miner's mental and physical health. Implementation of such technologies inside a mine is a challenging task due to the perilous and adverse mine environment. Various mine communication system, namely wired communication systems (coaxial, fiber optics, twisted pair), radio communication system, carrier current communication system and a mix of these two named as hybrid system has been developed over the years. Among these, wired communication is most inappropriate; as mine structure is dynamic and underlying wire get damaged during mining operations and can cause accidents inside the mine [6] . Radio communication system provides wireless connectivity but uses RF band for establishing communication. RF signal experiences multipath fading and path-loss while propagating inside the mine [6] . Moreover, it is not feasible to use surface technologies in underground mine. Underground mine is global positioning system (GPS) denied area, as signal gets attenuated easily in the presence of heavy mining machineries. Also GPS terminals are unable to process the beacons received from the satellite because of the obstructions present in underground mine [7] . Other wireless technologies such as radio frequency identification (RFID), wireless fidelity (Wi-Fi) and Zigbee, popular for indoor positioning above the surface [8] also fail to provide expected outcome in underground mine because of signal attenuation and path-loss, as these technologies operate in RF band.",

Visible light communication (VLC) technology is introduced in mine area to gather location information as it offers illumination, high speed data communication and localization [9] . It offers low cost, precise and accurate localization information [10, 11] . Unlike conventional RF-based system, VLC system uses unlicensed and unregulated [11] visible light spectrum (with wavelength 380-740 nm and frequency from 400 to 790 THz). VLC system is capable of providing high data rate. The signal is immune to electromagnetic interference. Line-of-sight (LOS) communication ensures reliability and security. VLC system is less prone to attenuation due to the use of high frequency. In this system LEDs act as transmitters and receivers comprises of photo-diodes (PDs) or image sensors (ISs). LEDs also help to illuminate [11] the gloomy mine environment which helps to boost the mental condition of miners. Along with this, low power wide area network (LPWAN) technology is also integrated in mine [12] for data transmission.",

From both the graphs, it is evident that SNR value decreases at the edges of the defined zone. SNR value could decrease, if strong interference is experienced by the receiver. But with the novel zone division method, this interference can be almost nullified. In the proposed method, decrease in SNR only means the miner moving away from the center point to the edge of the zone. Once the miner leaves that zone he will be latched with adjacent zone's LED. Thus signal overlapping problem is also reduced in this method. This concept will help in locating the miner's position accurately with respect to the transmitting LED. ",
