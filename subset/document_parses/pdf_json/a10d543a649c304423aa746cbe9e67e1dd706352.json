Starting in emergency departments and incorporating these diverse, broad, and separate data streams presents technical, operational, and logistical challenges but allows for a greater scientific understanding of the long-term effects of trauma. Our manuscript describes incorporating and prospectively linking these multi-dimensional big data elements into a clinical, observational study at US emergency departments with the goal to understand, prevent, and predict adverse posttraumatic neuropsychiatric sequelae (APNS) that affects over 40 million Americans annually. We outline key data-driven system challenges and solutions and investigate eligibility considerations, compliance, and response rate outcomes incorporating these diverse \"big data\" measures using integrated data-driven cross-discipline system architecture.",

At the same time, response rates are declining while concerns about privacy are growing [1] [2] [3] . These forces are all at play in the collection of data from emergency department (ED) trauma patients. Operationalizing this complex and extensive data collection effort requires an integrated and tailored data-driven web-based Information Management System (IMS). In addition to connecting big data sources with baseline health data, the IMS must also control the data flow, allow and enable system interconnections and linkages, enrich compliance prospectively, and adhere to safety, security, and human subject regulations while being user-friendly for participants and clinical and laboratory-based researchers.",

Of the 140 million Americans seen in US EDs [4, 5] , more than onethird (over 40 million Americans) present to US EDs for evaluation after trauma exposure [4, 6] , and the vast majority of the subset 40 million are discharged home after evaluation and only 10% are hospitalized [4, 6] . Although most of these individuals recover, an important subset develops adverse posttraumatic neuropsychiatric sequelae (APNS). The AURORA cooperative agreement targets the third group, or the ED traumatic event patients discharged home after evaluation, as the sample of interest. However, AURORA also recruits a small subsample of patients from those who are hospitalized to increase the external validity of findings and to facilitate comparison with other major studies that focus exclusively on patients who were hospitalized after ED evaluation [4] .",

Most germane to this manuscript are the different definitions and concepts and data sources. AURORA clearly meets the various definitions of healthcare big data across the five Vs: volume, variety, velocity, veracity, and value. We also meet other common big data definitions of energy and life-span [8] , types of healthcare data [9] , and analytic challenges [8, [10] [11] [12] [13] . AURORA encompasses many of the data sources [7, 14] typically referenced as part of healthcare big data: (1) clinical and medical (electronic medical records, diagnostic, prescription, brain imaging, functional magnetic resonance imaging, ancillary); (2) patient-generated (phenotypic, survey, audio recordings); (3) sensor and technology platforms (Verily Study Watch TM , digital phenotyping whereby participants use their own smartphones via Mindstrong Discovery APP TM , neurocognitive assessments via TestMyBrain TM web-based technology); and (4) genomic (DNA, RNA, and plasma via blood specimens; saliva).",

When budgets are restricted or timelines are tight, the ability to integrate IMS data with the primary survey/phenotypic tools is critical. The IMS allows for and integrates using wearables (i.e., Verily [Google] Study Watch TM ), smartphone data collection via digital phenotyping, neurocognitive assessments, biobehavioral data, and genomic data with survey data to achieve scientific aims and objectives. Given the magnitude of concurrent data collection across 30-40 EDs and participants being enrolled daily over a 4-to 5-year period, we needed to factor that having 5000 separate Study Watches was unrealistic and not needed for scientific objectives. Integration allows for adaptive sampling, immediate data access and sharing between surveys, and external data collections apps and tools while being cost efficient. To meet these challenges, RTI International has developed flexible and configurable systems with interoperable goals such as an internal study management system (Nirvana) [18] and survey authoring tools (Hatteras) [19] that allow for immediate sharing of case management data with newly collected survey data for sophisticated study management system purposes. They were also architected for customizations to meet studies' unique needs, establishing new accounts with apps for launching ecological/wearable technologies, neurocognitive assessments, mobile digital phenotyping, and other data sources to create a biobehavioral health data warehouse.",

This can be up to a 10-hour period. \" RTI's IMS included data quality and consistency checks to ensure that a participant's designated blackout period did not overlap with any of their best times to contact (i.e., to maximize compliance and response rates) previously collected in the same survey. Data collectors asked participants for clarification if there was overlap between these dichotomic periods. Table 4 summarizes the percentages of participants' blackout periods for the n = 2641 included in this analysis from September 2017 through February 2020. Over 93% of AURORA participants self-reported what appeared to be their sleeping hours as the blackout period.",

Because RTI hosted and housed AURORA's personally identifiable information/protected health information within our secure, NIH-compliant computing center, we balanced competing and diverse regulatory requirements via a tiered approach and adherence to (1) our cooperative agreement terms and conditions with the Prime contractor; (2) NIH and Prime security and IRB policies; (3) RTI's access, security, and monitoring policies; and (4) any third-party DUAs.
