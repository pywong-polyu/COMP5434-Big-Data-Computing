This study aimed to describe the online interactive content created for delivery of an undergraduate nutrition course and to evaluate student engagement with the online interactive content. We collected online questionnaire data in 2018 and 2019 from two cohorts of students enrolled in a Deakin University undergraduate nutrition unit. Two-sample unpaired t-tests were used to examine differences in participant engagement with online topic guides between static text-based and interactive content. A total of 89 participants (19-56 years) were included. Sixty four of students reported always/usually reading static text-based topic guides most weeks and 64% perceived them as moderately/highly effective. While 60% of participants reported reading the online interactive topic guides most weeks and 93% perceived them as moderate/highly effective. Most participants indicated the interactive topic guides were more effective than static text-based topic guides they experienced in other courses (76%). Hours dedicated to the online interactive topic guide were higher (6.4 SD 2.9 vs. 1.7 SD 1.7 h; P < 0.001) as was the rating of how engaging the topic guides were (7.2 SD 1.6 vs. 6.7 SD 2.5; P = 0.008). These findings suggest that interactive content is more engaging. However, this content may not be accessible to all students, and so familiarization and training prior to engaging in an interactive online unit may be needed.",

High quality interactive online content enables students to receive immediate formative feedback, encourages critical thinking and better supports students to meet their learning outcomes (5, 6) .",

            "text": "There is evidence that students are more engaged when curricula use online interactive content (7, 8) . Nonetheless, engagement is likely to differ depending on the learning design (9, 10) . To date, most research on nutrition student engagement has focused on in-person interactive learning and flipped classroom active learning approaches (11) (12) (13) (14) . A paucity of studies has examined engagement with online interactive content in nutrition undergraduate students. In a study in 29 US undergraduate students, formative online assessment was an effective and feasible method to improve student engagement (15) . In contrast, in a study of 31 UK undergraduate nutrition and dietetics students, students reported that online content was engaging, but they still preferred face-to-face learning (16) . In both studies there was limited reporting of how the online content was designed, or what it included, thus the optimal design of engaging online learning material is unclear. While commercial platforms have been developed for increasing online student engagement, these may not be appropriate for all settings. Moreover, the learning theories that underpin the design of online learning for students vary, and the evidence is mixed for the optimum balance between interactivity and cognitive load (17, 18) .",

The authors (KML and SM), with input from the learning design team, created the interactive content using HTML5 Package (HP5) and embedded content into HTML pages. An example of an interactive activity is presented in Figure 1 . In this \"drag and drop\" activity students were presented with a section of text describing three dietary assessment methods with missing words, and were asked to drag the words into the correct boxes to identify the advantages and disadvantages of each method. Immediate feedback was provided with the option to retry until the correct responses were achieved. Interactive explanatory materials were also provided to students in the form of video notes from the lecturer describing a key concept. An example of an interactive video is presented in Figure 2 , where students were presented with a video of the lecturer explaining the different applications of five key Nutrient Reference Values, and at certain points were prompted to answer a question to test their understanding of these Nutrient Reference Values before the video continued. Information in the online content was also presented in a more visually rich manner than the PDF documents, with images and symbols used to signpost sections of content and activities (Figure 3) . A comment from the lecturer was also placed on each HTML page to provide a sense of teacher presence.

Lifespan Nutrition is a core unit of the undergraduate Bachelor of Nutrition Sciences course offered by the School of Exercise and Nutrition Sciences. A combined total of 576 students were enrolled in the 2018 and 2019 units. The unit is delivered across Victoria, Australia, as a hybrid in-person/online campus as well as online for students enrolled online-only. Students enrolled in a hybrid in-person/online campus attend weekly 2-h lectures and seminar discussions in-person or online. Online-only students join these lectures via livestream and attend online synchronous seminars. Students are able to interact with peers and educators during in-person lectures and seminars or via written chat if joining via the livestreaming. Deakin University's Learning Management System Blackboard Ultra also provides a Discussion Board monitored by educators on which all students can post and respond to questions at any time. All students had access to weekly topic guides. In the 2018 unit, students had access to online static text-based topic guides only. These topic guides were in the form of a structured PDF document and provide content that is more detailed than that presented via oral presentation with PowerPoint slides in the face-to-face lectures. In the 2019 unit, students had access to online interactive topic guides in the form of HTML pages instead of static text-based topic guides. The content and sequence of information in these topic guides were the same in both units, but the modality and format in which the information was presented was different.",

Demographic data collected included age (categorized into 18-21 years and 22-56 years), sex (female or male) and campus (categorized into hybrid in-person/online, or onlineonly). Information on personal learning experiences within the unit were collected. Participants were asked how often they read the topic guide, with response options of always, usually, sometimes, rarely, never. Participants reported how effective they found the topic guides for meeting the unit learning outcomes (scale 0-10). These were re-grouped into tertiles for descriptive purposes: low, moderate and high effectiveness. Information was collected on how many hours per week participants studied the topic guides and how engaging they were (scale 0-10). In the 2019 unit with interactive online topic guides, participants were asked if they preferred the online interactive topic guide to the static text-based topic guide (Yes, No). A short description of static text-based and online interactive topic guides was included in the questionnaire for standardization; an interactive topic guide was described as including online activities and opportunities to test learning and get immediate feedback/answers.",

In a study of 2,196 students from 29 Austrian universities, students indicated online learning provided a clear and coherent structure and advocated for its use when developing skills in self-regulated learning (25) . However, there is evidence that the design of online learning material is imperative for delivering coherent and engaging content. In particular, studies have shown students prefer formative assessment tools, such as practice quizzes and case studies, over text readings and PowerPoint slides (26) . Thus, while online interactive content is designed based on best practice learning paradigms, such as constructivism and cognitivism (4), the learning materials are also designed with the aim of improving engagement. For example, the inclusion of interactive and multimedia content enables the student to be an active agent in their learning and to develop critical thinking and problem-solving skills, while also creating a fun and engaging learning experience for the student (8, 27) .",

In constructivist theory, there is a focus on learning design that encourages active engagement, or participation, with the content (4, 28). As described by Carwile, \"the notion that students actively construct their knowledge fits within the framework of online education because students are separated from their teachers and expected to have the autonomy to regulate their learning\" (29) . However, the literature in this area is still emerging, and limited research exists in the field of nutrition education. In a recent nutrition and health virtual classroom case study in Portuguese students, the use of a pedagogical strategy for higher education highlighted the benefit of problem-based learning and online interaction (with peers and teachers) for achieving successful learning outcomes (30) . This aligns with the present study, where quizzes, case studies and the presence of the educator in the learning content and discussion forums provided a constructivist and student-centered learning environment. Moreover, the consideration of strategies to minimize extraneous cognitive overload, such as being mindful of coordinating visual and verbal cues, align with previous literature on the optimal design of constructivist online learning (17, 21) .",

These findings support the use of online interactive learning content grounded in constructivist and cognitive theory. However, the small sample of students included in this study means that this content may not be accessible to all students, and so familiarization and training prior to engaging in an interactive online unit may be needed. As these data were collected prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, future research should extend these findings to identify further opportunities for improving nutrition student outcomes in a blended or fully online learning environment.",
