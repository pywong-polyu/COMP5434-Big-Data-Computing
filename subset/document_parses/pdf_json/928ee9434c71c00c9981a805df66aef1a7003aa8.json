At the level of the test itself, performance characteristics including the analytical sensitivity and specificity must be considered alongside the clinical pre-test probability. Tests detecting viral nucleic acids or proteins are time-dependent, displaying the greatest sensitivity and diagnostic utility shortly after symptom onset. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing remains the gold standard method of case definition (2); the sensitivity of PCR tests depends on the type of body fluid analyzed (7) and time from symptom onset (8, 9) . Rapid antigen tests have been deployed in asymptomatic screening programmes in an attempt to interrupt viral transmission (10, 11) . These tests appear less sensitive that PCR but may be helpful in detecting individuals with relatively high-viral loads (PCR cycle thresholds <30) and guiding selfisolation policy (12, 13) .",

The overwhelming majority of respondents considered antigen tests critically important (63.3%) or very important (27.1%) in the control of the COVID-19 pandemic (Figure 1A) . By comparison, fewer respondents considered antibody tests important for the control of the pandemic (critically important 44.0% or very important 34.9%, \u03c7 2 = 1513, df =3, p < 0.0001). LMICs attributed greater importance to antigen tests in the control of the pandemic than HICs (\u03c7 2 = 201.8, df = 3, p < 0.0001), while a greater percentage of respondents from HICs considered antibody tests of critical importance in pandemic control (\u03c7 2 = 228.9, df =3, p < 0.0001). Accordingly, the likelihood of respondents requesting antigen tests was significantly greater than that for an antibody tests overall (\u03c7 2 = 510.5, df =4, p < 0.0001, for trend); this effect was more marked when LMICs were compared to HICs (Figure 1B) .",
