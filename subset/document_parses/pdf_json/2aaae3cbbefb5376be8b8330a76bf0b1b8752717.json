Paralinguistic cues, such as repeated punctuation, are used to compensate for the lack of non-verbal cues in textbased formats. However, it is unclear whether these cues indeed bridge the potential gap between the writer's intentions and the reader's interpretations. A pilot study and two experiments investigated the effect of using repeated punctuation on behavioral intention to assist an email writer in a work-related situation. Findings demonstrate that while the intentions behind using repeated punctuation relate to signaling situational importance or affective state, behavioral intentions are driven by dispositional rather than situational attributions. Specifically, the use of repeated punctuation reduces perceived competence of the message writer and consequently decreases positive behavioral intentions. Overall, the study challenges the simplified view of paralinguistic cues as communication facilitators, highlighting their potential harmful effects on impression formation and behavioral intentions in the digital age.",

Specifically, more and more communication is being conveyed via text-based media, such as emails (Radicati and Levenstein, 2015; Goodman-Deane et al., 2016) , known to be lean in social cues compared to face-to-face (FTF), video, or voice interactions (Daft and Lengel, 1986) . While emails enable quick communication and increase productivity (Derks and Bakker, 2010) , people often experience work-related email overload (Dabbish and Kraut, 2006) , which is no surprise as an enormous amount of work emails is being exchanged daily (app. 130 billion according to Radicati and Levenstein, 2015) . Clearly, not all emails are equally important or urgent to the email writer. Cues, such as repeated punctuation (\"!!\" and \"??\"), are often used as non-verbal signaling of importance (Oberlander and Gill, 2006) . Adding various cues to emails is prevalent (Kalman and Gergle, 2014) ; however, their impact on message interpretation has received scant attention. When on the receiving end, do we interpret the use of repeated punctuation as a sign of importance, and do we respond accordingly? The present study's aim is to systematically investigate how the use of repeated punctuation shapes the interpretation and consequent behavioral intentions of the message receiver in work-related email communication.",

However, as emails are asynchronous and relatively lean in social information, they leave much room for the reader's interpretation. Due to this interpretation challenge, readers tend to actively search for additional information embedded within an email text that can help with the interpretation process, including paralinguistic cues (Byron, 2008; Johri, 2012; Tong and Walther, 2015) . Moreover, the growing reliance on textbased digital services (Przegalinska et al., 2019; Yang, 2021) has led to the use of programmed chat bots. It is important that these digital tools \"understand\" the true intention of customers and, as importantly, communicate back in such a manner that would lead to the clearest and most effective message. Thus, understanding the impact these cues have on text-based interaction and communication is paramount.",

Social information processing theory suggests that paralinguistic cues are utilized in place of non-verbal cues to overcome CMC limitations of lack of social presence (Walther, 2007 (Walther, , 2016 . Overall, paralinguistic cues have been argued to enrich the expressiveness of the text, disambiguate it, convey affect and a sense of immediacy, and emphasize intended statements (Aldunate and Gonz\u00e1lez-Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez, 2017; Prada et al., 2018; Liu and Sun, 2020) . However, some empirical research that examined interpretation of paralinguistic cues in textual communication has challenged this notion. For example, Riordan and Trichtinger (2017) found that paralinguistic cues did not facilitate accurate interpretations of email messages, despite feelings of (over)confidence in perceiving the intended message. Thus, whether paralinguistic cues are accurately interpreted and convey the communicator's intentions remains an open question (Scott and Fullwood, 2020) .",

There is a plethora of research showing how people interpret and attribute situational as well as dispositional inferences when judging actions of others (e.g., Cramton et al., 2007; Kammrath et al., 2007; van Kleef et al., 2012; Hareli, 2014; Elsbach and Bechky, 2017; Riordan and Glikson, 2020) . Two fundamental dimensions on which people predominantly judge others are warmth and competence (Judd et al., 2005; Fiske et al., 2007) . Warmth reflects perceived social intentions (e.g., friendliness), while competence stands for perceived capacity to achieve goals (e.g., skill). Notably, these judgments were found to beget important behavioral intentions in social settings, such as deciding whether or not to hire a candidate for a job (Cuddy et al., 2011) . Thus, it is not merely interpretations; these interpretations have consequences on future actions.",

            "text": "The underlying assumption of the present study, based on CMC literature described above, is that people use repeated punctuation in CMC to convey situational cues. Purposely, they wish to convey through these cues the importance or immediacy of their message and express their emotions and are not intentionally attempting to convey information about their character. To establish this assumption, we conducted a pilot study. Sixty-three undergraduate students from a large American university (52% female, M age = 25.9) filled the questionnaire on a voluntarily basis. The questionnaire described the use of multiple question marks in CMC and consisted of a variety of filler questions regarding paralinguistic habitual use. The relevant question for the present work regarded the role of repeated question marks and, particularly, what they convey. Items included multiple affective reasoning (\"negative affective state\") and contextual reasoning (e.g., \"emphasizing the urgency of the issue\"), as well as personrelated reasoning (e.g., \"inability of the person to express themselves with words\") rated on a Likert scale from 1 (\"Strongly disagree\") to 7 (\"Strongly agree\"). As expected, the affective and contextual reasons received significantly higher ratings (M = 4.32, SD = 1.22, Cohen's d = 0.56, M = 4.63, SD = 1.57, Cohen's d = 0.68, respectively) than person-related reasons (M = 3.58, SD = 1.54), p's \u2264 0.006. Moreover, only affective and contextual reasons differed significantly from the scale's medium value (p's < 0.001). These results offer empirical support to the theoretical notion that paralinguistic cues in CMC are perceived as a means to convey information about the context the writer is experiencing (i.e., situational), rather than information about the writer's traits or personality (i.e., dispositional).",

(2017) found that using a salutation with an exclamation mark harmed the perception of competence for female, but not for male writers. Butterworth et al. (2019) found that perceptions of appropriateness and likability of email writers were also malleable to gender and type of emoji used. Thus, the use of repeated punctuation by women might strengthen negative female stereotypes, which are associated with overexpressiveness and are generally related to negative trait assessments (Greenwood and Isbell, 2002; Barrett and Bliss-Moreau, 2009 ). We therefore examined gender as a potential moderator:",

To further understand the process by which people interpret paralinguistic cues, we aimed to examine whether the clarity of the message content would affect the relationship between using repeated punctuation and interpretation. As mentioned, paralinguistic cues are often used to clarify the message and its context (Houghton et al., 2018) . Therefore, the use of paralinguistic cues with ambiguous messages should be more justifiable than such use when the content of the message is clear. This means that for ambiguous messages the use of repeated punctuation could be less harmful with regard to dispositional attributions and intentional behaviors than such use for messages with a clear content. This novel factor was examined in Experiment 2 by asking participants to rate the clarity of the message. As gender did not moderate our findings in Experiment 1, we did not address it in Experiment 2.",

This gender-blind phenomenon can be attributed to the strength of communication norms, violation of which drives negative attributions for both genders. In contrast, we did find a moderating role of message clarity. When messages were perceived as ambiguous, repeated punctuation cues did not have an adverse effect. Only when the content of message was clear did these added cues have a negative impact. This highlights the role of message clarity as a novel potential moderator for interpretation of paralinguistic cues in CMC, suggesting that when people do not understand the written message, they try to use additional cues as information and do not penalize the punctuation (ab)user.",

Thus, the negative consequences we find in our experiments might be related to interpretation of these cues as an inappropriate emotional display (Cheshin, 2020) .

While the focus of the present study was impression formation of novel situations, it will be interesting to further examine how reciprocal interactions play out when repeated paralinguistic cues are used. In addition, the effect of repeated paralinguistic cues could be influenced by the hierarchical roles of the correspondents. Future research should explore whether the unequal social roles between the writer and the reader moderate the repeated marks impact. Second, these were all lab-based studies; despite the use of real emails in Experiment 2, the evaluations given were requests from researchers, and we can only assume that these also take place in real-life settings. Third, we ran our experiments in two different countries with different cultural norms and values. The first experiment was run in the Netherlands, in English, while the second experiment was run in Israel in Hebrew.
