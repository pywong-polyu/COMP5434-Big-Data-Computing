ST23 has caused both epidemic and sporadic cases between 1995 and 2018 and was analysed at genomic level and compared with ST23 isolated in other countries to determine possible similarities and differences. A core genome multi-locus sequence typing (cgMLST), based on a previously described set of 1,521 core genes, and single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) approaches were applied to an ST23 collection including genomes from Italy, France, Denmark and Scotland. DNAs were automatically extracted, libraries prepared using NextEra library kit and MiSeq sequencing performed. Overall, 63 among clinical and environmental Italian Lp1 isolates and a further seven and 11 ST23 from Denmark and Scotland, respectively, were sequenced, and pangenome analysed. Both cgMLST and SNPs analyses showed very few loci and SNP variations in ST23 genomes. All the ST23 causing outbreaks and sporadic cases in Italy and elsewhere, were phylogenetically related independent of year, town or country of isolation. Distances among the ST23s were further shortened when SNPs due to horizontal gene transfers were removed. The Lp1 ST23 isolated in Italy have kept their monophyletic origin, but they are phylogenetically close also to ST23 from other countries. The ST23 are quite widespread in Italy, and a thorough epidemiological investigation is compelled to determine sources of infection when this ST is identified in both LD sporadic cases and outbreaks.",

The illness develops after inhalation of contaminated aerosols mainly produced by different man-made water systems, including showers, cooling towers, and decorative fountains (Chauhan & Shames, 2021) . In Europe between 2018 and 2019, the LD incidence was 2.2 per 100,000 inhabitants, showing an increasing trend compared with previous years (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2020) . According to the ECDC surveillance atlas of 2019, Italy reported the highest incidence equal to 5,29 per 100,000 inhabitants and the highest number of LD cases in the EU (n = 3,143). In 2020, the number of cases decreased by 35% compared with 2019, but Italy still had the highest number of reported cases in the EU. The decline might be correlated with the COVID-19 pandemic which led to travel restrictions (fewer travel-associated cases), worldwide government instigated lockdowns and to wearing masks in public areas.

This was based on mapping sequence reads to reference genomes followed by the analysis of either single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) or a gene-by-gene approach that reproduces on a larger scale the multi-locus sequence typing (MLST). Whole-genome MLST (wgMLST) has been applied to study the genomic diversity of Lp clinical strains, unrelated to specific epidemic events, and interestingly previously unknown clusters were revealed (Raphael et al, 2019) . WGS also showed that a single Lp1 clone was the cause of three outbreaks when SNP, core genome MLST and pangenome approach was used (Timms et al, 2018) . Recently, a core genome MLST (cgMLST) scheme, based on 1,521 core genes, has been proposed to investigate LD outbreaks (Moran-Gilad et al, 2015) and has been demonstrated to be very useful during LD outbreak investigations. Petzold et al (2017) , showed that Lp isolates, sharing a unique ST, that fell into two separate clusters, were only different because of recombination events in specific regions of the genome.",

ST23 isolated in Scotland from patients who had travelled to Southern Europe differed by between 1 and 33 cg loci from ST23 isolated in Italy and France. Generally, the loci differences found in ST23 genomes mainly corresponded to genes encoding proteins related to the carbohydrate, amino acids, and lipid metabolism, and several for transport and binding (Table S9) .

SNP analysis identified six polymorphisms (pairwise 2,417-3,933) among strains undistinguishable by cgMLST. To verify the origin of SNP in this collection, ST23 were aligned against a reference genome using snippy and the maximum pairwise SNP difference calculated for the entire ST23 collection was 4,799 and was found in the HL05063005 genome from France (Table S8) . As determined by Gubbins, a range of 37.5-99.9% of SNP differences were due to recombination. The genomes that showed least recombinations were those from (DK10) and Southern Europe (4697). After removal of the SNP due to recombination, which represented a mean of 4.62%, the maximum pairwise differences was 46 and again it was found in 299C genome (Fig S1) .",

This behaviour has already been observed in ST23 and in ST1, ST37, and ST62 but not in ST47, where recombinations events were not found (David et al, 2016a ). It has been described that regions encompassing several genes, with a high number of polymorphisms, have exchanged DNA with different strains and species, and this phenomen is more frequently found in strains isolated in the environment (Gomez-Valero et al, 2011) . Consisting with the \"dead-end\" nature of Legionella infection, only the environment can exert a selective pressure. Therefore, it appears surprising that genomes isolated in different countries could be so phylogenetically close. The pangenome data highlighted the presence of accessory genes shared by unrelated ST23, but also specifically present in ST23 closely related in terms of country of origin. This pool of accessory genes could have been determined by plasmids and other mobile genetic elements that have not contributed to divergence of the ST23 genomes. Understanding the origin of these genes will be the subject of further investigations, Minimum spanning tree based on the set of 1,216 cgMLST targets shared by all the ST23 object of this study and by 14 not-ST23 is shown.
