However, PrEP continuation and high adherence remain challenges to its impact. Existing PrEP adherence interventions can be time-and cost-intensive. Widescale PrEP delivery will require the identification of layered PrEP support strategies for AGYW with diverse prevention needs. We describe the design of a sequential multiple assignment randomized trial (SMART) to evaluate a PrEP adherence support model using scalable, stepped interventions in AGYW in South Africa.",

However, these approaches have either been evaluated as standalone interventions or as part of a package. Therefore, results from these PrEP studies do not provide evidence about the optimal sequence of combination adherence interventions that is most effective for AGYW. These interventions can be quite cost-and time-intensive, and widescale PrEP delivery will require understanding the characteristics of AGYW who adhere well to PrEP with only minimal adherence support and identifying layered intensive strategies that will work for those who need more intensive support. A stepped PrEP adherence support model has the potential to be feasible, resource-saving, and similar to differentiated care models for HIV in which frequent visits with more intensive support are directed to the minority of patients who may benefit from them most [32, 33] .",

We aim to enroll up to 500 AGYW to ensure that we retain approximately 350 AGYW who complete at least three months of study procedures in Johannesburg, South Africa. This will ensure that we follow AGYW and provide PrEP interventions to the group interested in PrEP after the first several months of use, when PrEP drop-off is expected to be high. We will follow participants for nine months to assess the interventions' effect on PrEP adherence (Figs 1 and 2) . Trial conduct and reporting will be informed by the Consolidated Standard of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) evidence-based recommendations for randomized trials.",

Second, we aim to evaluate, among those who do not achieve PrEP adherence by two months, the proportion who adhere well to PrEP after receiving one of the two intensified interventions (monthly visits with issue-focused counseling, quarterly visits with counseling based on PrEP blood levels, called drug-level feedback counseling). This analysis will be restricted to those with low PrEP adherence in the first two months, defined as having tenofovir diphosphate (TFV-DP) drug concentration less than 500 fmol/punch or missing PrEP refills. Additional details are provided in the \"Rationale for SMART Design\" section below. Third, we will evaluate the optimal sequence of intensifying adherence support.",

In the iPrEx study among men who have sex with men (MSM) and transgender women (TGW), the TFV-DP threshold of 700 fmol/punch represented dosing \ufffd 4 times a week and was associated with 100% efficacy [36] .

While the TFV-DP threshold of 700 fmol/punch will be used for our primary outcome assessment as previously described, we will use a threshold of 500 fmol/punch at the two-month study visit to determine whether a participant is a \"responder\" or \"non-responder,\" which corresponds to an average of 2-3 doses per week [36] . It is a more sensitive threshold to classify consistent dosing after only two months of PrEP use and will ensure that we are allocating additional adherence support resources to participants with the greatest difficulty taking PrEP regularly.",

A recent meta-analysis found that two-way text messaging can be effective for antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence, particularly with messaging provided on a less than daily basis and tailored content and timing [43] . The recent HPTN 082 study built off this evidence base to develop a two-way SMS intervention for PrEP adherence among AGYW in South Africa and Zimbabwe [29] . Study participants were sent a weekly discrete SMS message, \"Are you well, girlfriend?\", and were asked to respond \"yes\" or \"no\", where \"no\" responses could indicate that they needed a staff member to follow up and discuss side effects, adherence challenges, or other issues. Participants who responded \"no\" or those who did not respond received a call-back from staff within 24 hours. This intervention was feasible and acceptable for AGYW and PrEP SMART follows a similar model.",

Prior research has found that peer support clubs improve adherence among outpatients starting ART [44] [45] [46] , hard to reach patients [47] , and adolescents [48] . Peer groups may improve adherence by offering social and emotional support to encourage the management of health behavior [49] . Evidence from recent PrEP studies (HPTN 082, EMPOWER) has shown that monthly, in-person peer adherence clubs were well-attended and highly acceptable among AGYW initiating PrEP [26, 50] . In HPTN 082, 50% of participants attended three or more peer support/adherence clubs in the first six months of PrEP use. However, in-person groups posed logistical barriers to participation, particularly for AGYW with competing school and work priorities, and are difficult to implement in the context of regional lockdowns and requirements for social distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic. WhatsApp groups may overcome barriers to in-person adherence groups while impacting health behavior change through peer support and coping skills.

            "text": "The rationale for the use of drug-level feedback counseling first arose from an early PrEP randomized trial where women reported a desire for feedback on their PrEP adherence through pharmacologic testing and directed counseling [27] . More recently, HPTN 082 tested a PrEP adherence support package that included drug-level feedback counseling based on TFV-DP levels in DBS obtained at the prior visit. This study did not find statistically significant differences in adherence levels between the retrospective drug-level feedback counseling and standard counseling arms during follow-up [29] . However, notably, 31% of women in the drug-level feedback counseling arm did not receive their counseling because DBS results were not available at the visit, as they had to be batch-shipped and performed, or they did not receive the appropriate counseling message due to miscoding of the laboratory results [29] . Retrospective drug-level feedback also may not have improved PrEP adherence because it was provided one month after the DBS sample was collected, and reflected adherence in the fourto-six weeks prior to the visit at which the DBS sample was taken. It may have been difficult for women to remember their pill-taking behavior and adherence barriers from approximately two months before they received the counseling. In addition, HPTN 082 provided drug-level feedback counseling alongside monthly PrEP adherence support clubs and two-way SMS messages, and had an observed HIV incidence of 1.0 per 100 person-years, which was significantly lower than the estimated HIV incidence of 3.7% from a counterfactual estimate of HIV incidence, indicating the success of this intervention package overall and making it difficult to disentangle the effect of only drug-level feedback on PrEP adherence [51] . We will be able to improve the drug-level feedback counseling procedures using key lessons learned in HPTN 082 and, through our SMART design, we have the unique potential to answer questions about the impact of drug-level feedback for AGYW in this stepped-up care approach.",

Recruitment is led by an experienced team of community health workers who are known and trusted in the areas where we are recruiting PrEP SMART participants. We developed a PrEP SMART recruitment flipchart to explain study rationale, procedures, and potential risks and benefits of participation using adolescent-friendly language and graphics. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, schools were closed and individuals' movement between geographic regions has been restricted. As a result, the team has devised new strategies to identify eligible AGYW, including recruitment via housing associations, religious groups, daycare centers, social media advertisements, and geographic and social media mapping to identify clusters of AGYW where we could target informational sessions and outreach. We also developed social media flyers to circulate via Facebook and our study clinician has held Facebook virtual sessions to answer AGYW questions about PrEP and the study. We will purposively sample potential participants to include young women between ages 18-25 years and to ensure a mix of young women who are in university and those who have less than university education.",

Each group is led by a staff facilitator and a young woman who is experienced in taking PrEP (a \"PrEP Ambassador\") who moderate and answer questions about PrEP, facilitate discussions, introduce topics of interest, monitor member conduct and enforce group rules. Each month, facilitators develop a plan that consists of activities and topics such as \"Ladies Night\", \"Ask a Doctor\", games, memes, etc., to stimulate discussions. The topics are informed by participants, public holidays, and issues trending in social media and the news. The group facilitator is responsible for adding and removing individuals from the group when they exit the study, request to be removed, or violate the group rules. Groups are also given the option to meet in person, for about one to two hours approximately quarterly, to stimulate group cohesion. Secondary interventions: Drug-level feedback counseling. Women who are randomized to drug-level feedback counseling at Month 3 will move to quarterly visits and receive counseling based on DBS TFV-DP levels obtained at Months 2 and 6. Adherence counseling based on these drug levels will be provided in person at the Month 3 visit (based on results from the DBS sample taken at Month 2) and telephonically after the Month 6 visit (based on results from the DBS sample taken at Month 6).

Recruitment activities resumed on 1 June 2020, while adhering to local guidance on personal protective equipment (PPE) and physical distancing. We are conducting remote visits for monthly counseling, HIV and pregnancy self-testing, and qualitative interviews via telephone when feasible, and collect quantitative and qualitative data on satisfaction with and acceptability of remote visit procedures.",

Our initial intervention approaches are \"light touch\" mHealth approaches which could be implemented in PrEP programmes-two-way SMS messages and WhatsApp peer support groups-followed by either monthly counseling or quarterly drug-level feedback counseling for participants who require additional adherence support. A stepped approach to adherence counseling may maximize the individual and public health impact of PrEP among young African women by supporting women who are motivated to use PrEP but encounter issues with daily pill-taking in a scalable, feasible, and resource-saving manner [6, 22] . Our study has several potential limitations. Our sample size calculations for the second objective assessing differences in PrEP adherence between monthly counseling and drug-level feedback counseling is based on hypotheses around how many individuals will be non-adherent to PrEP after the first few months in the study. However, we may have fewer re-randomized individuals and would be less able to detect a statistically significant difference in PrEP adherence between our secondary interventions. We selected a time point of three months for re-randomization (based on month 2 drug levels) given prior evidence about drop-offs in PrEP adherence and persistence among young women around this time, but our results may be different with a longer time period until re-randomization. Finally, we did not include a run-in period and may therefore re-randomize young women who wanted to try PrEP for a brief period but decided that it was not the right HIV prevention option for them.",
