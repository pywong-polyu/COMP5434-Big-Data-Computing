In active screening, at-risk settlements are targeted for the mass screening of all residents [2] . Passive surveillance is conducted in fixed health centers with available gHAT diagnostic tools, where patients with symptoms can self-present and be tested for infection. These surveillance strategies, designed to deliver effective control for gHAT, also double to provide valuable information on monitoring and evaluation of the gHAT situation across endemic settings.",

This is true in several health zones of the former Equateur province (now consisting of the 5 provinces Nord-Ubangi, Sud-Ubangi, Equateur, Mongala, and Tshuapa). The former Equateur province had the highest burden of gHAT in the DRC in 2000 but, following extensive active screening campaigns, now reports far fewer infections [1, 5, 6] . This low reporting introduces the possibility that local EOT may have already been achieved in some health zones-administrative regions made up of approximately 100 000 inhabitants. However, with intensified disease management infections, such as gHAT, the interplay between surveillance and control is complex; gHAT active screening will reduce in regions with little or no reporting, but this in turn could lead to less chance of detecting remaining infection if it is stopped too early.",

These health zones have all had zero or low numbers of reported gHAT cases in the last decade, despite varying active screening efforts. We estimate the changing transmission over time and thereby calculate the probability that these health zones have already achieved EOT. We also project forward to determine the probability of EOT up until 2040. Due to a reduction in active screening in these health zones, we examine how increasingly limited data impact the certainty of our model estimates and highlight that active screening is a key tool in measuring elimination.",

In this study, we use data from 2000 to 2018 of the annual screening numbers and the number of confirmed cases in active screening and passive surveillance for 3 health zones (Bominenge, Budjala, and Mbaya). In addition to case numbers, the infection stage of most cases is known from 2015 onward, and this provides some information about the duration of infection in these patients. Stages of gHAT are defined by the point at which parasites cross the blood-brain barrier, and stage 2 (late stage) is diagnosed through detection of trypanosomes in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) or an elevated white blood cell (WBC) count in the CSF (>5 WBC/\u00b5L). Traditionally, different treatments were required for the different stages, which is why lumbar puncture was routinely performed. The new treatment-fexinidazole-removes the need for staging in patients without severe symptoms; however, this was not approved for use in DRC until after the data period [13] .",

Similarly, we consider what would happen to the probability of achieving EOT by 2021 if either the mean active screening was conducted and no cases were reported in each health zone, or if a very large active screening with 50% coverage was performed, also with no cases reported. Under model S, perfect specificity was assumed for this active screening, but not in other years.

In Bominenge and Budjala, the models produce relatively tight credible intervals for case reporting and new infections due to the high case numbers in the early 2000s and the high coverage active screening, both of which reduce our uncertainty. During 2000-2016, the 2 models' credible intervals are largely overlapping for each of these health zones. In Mbaya, there has not been very high case reporting nor screening during 2000-2016, and uncertainty in the inferred transmission and predicted future reporting is larger. Model W has a wide tail on new infections for Mbaya compared to model S and is, in part, explained by model S assuming improvement in passive surveillance during the data period, whereas model W assumes constant passive detection rates throughout.

In Mbaya, only one case has been reported since 2009, which, on the surface, may suggest EOT is likely to have been achieved. This corresponds well with modelling predictions of a 72% (model W) and 96% (model S) probability of EOT by 2020 ( Figure 2 , first column).

By selecting subsets of our simulations that match the zero case reporting that occurred in 2017 and 2018 for Budjala and Mbaya, we see that the probability that EOT has already been met increases for both models and in both health zones. These additional 2 years of zeros raise the probability more under model W (57% to 92% for Budjala and 72% to 94% in Mbaya) compared to model S (98% to >99% for Budjala and 98% to >99% in Mbaya). In total, 33% and 0.3% of simulations match the 2017/18 zero case reporting in Budjala and 62% and 90% match it in Mbaya (models W and S, respectively). Bominenge has had low level case reporting in 2017 and 2018; however, if there were no cases reported in 2021, there would be an estimated 99% probability of having met EOT under model S and 89% under model W. Without this information, the models currently have lower certainty in EOT: 86% in 2020 for model S and 61% in model W. It is noted that the mean coverage of active screening for 2014-2018 is very low in all the health zones (12% for Bominenge, and virtually no screening in Budjala and Mbaya); however, by doing a single large screen covering 50% of the population in 2021, this could further raise the estimated probability that EOT had been achieved to 94% if zero cases were found under model W; model S finds this still results in a >99% probability (virtually no change).",

This underlines the importance of a passive surveillance system that can provide data on the testing of individuals within health facilities. Additional information, that no cases were reported in 2017-18, provides a greater certainty of EOT for future times (Figure 2, second column) , which is further increased if another active screening reported no cases (Figure 2 , third and fourth columns). For Budjala and Bominenge, we have estimated high probabilities of EOT within the next 5 years, assuming active screening will continue with similar coverage. Past high coverage of active screening (eg, up to 62% in Bominenge and 53% in Budjala) enables better model estimation of transmission patterns in the health zone. Maintaining a high active screening coverage can both reduce any remaining transmission, by the detection and treatment of infection, and provides the surveillance mechanism required to have confidence that EOT has been reached. A single year of high-coverage active screening resulting in no new case detections would be very informative in establishing EOT in locations where there was lower certainty based on past data.",

Furthermore, we do not account for a reservoir of asymptomatic humans that are infected but are difficult to detect due to the parasites surviving in the skin, rather than the blood. These individuals are known to exist, but the extent and consequence for elimination campaigns remains unknown [22] .
