Analysis of neutralizing 26 antibody titers in the sera of vaccinated individuals without previous history of infection and from 27 convalescent individuals showed partial resistance of the viruses. In contrast, sera from 28 individuals with a previous history of SARS-CoV-2 infection who were subsequently vaccinated, 29 neutralized variants with titers 4-11-fold higher, providing a rationale for vaccination of infection-30 experienced individuals. The heavily mutated C.1.2 spike was the most antibody neutralization-31 resistant spike to date; however, the avidity of C.1.2 spike protein for ACE2 was low. This finding 32 suggests that the virus evolved to escape the humoral response but has a decrease in fitness 33 suggesting that it may cause milder disease or be less transmissible. It may be difficult for the 34 spike protein to evolve to escape neutralizing antibodies while maintaining high affinity for ACE2. 35 36 J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 84 infectivity was similar on ACE2.A549 cells, except that the infectivity differences were greater, 85 most likely due to the low level of ACE2 on these cells.

The neutralizing titers 105 against Beta, Delta and Delta+N501S were decreased 4.8-, 3.4-and 3.4-fold, respectively.

Viruses with the variant spikes 51 were partially resistant to neutralization. The C.1.2 variant, which is highly mutated, was the most 52 resistant. Sera from previously infected patients vaccinated with BNT162b2 had high neutralizing 53 titer against all of the variants, providing a strong rationale for the vaccination of previously 54 infected individuals. The resistance of the C.1.2 spike protein to neutralization was largely 55 mediated by the Y449H mutation in the RBD. However, the mutation resulted in a significant 56 decrease in avidity of the spike protein for ACE2.
