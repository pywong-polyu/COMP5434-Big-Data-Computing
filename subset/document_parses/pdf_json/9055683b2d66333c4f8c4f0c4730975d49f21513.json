The range of gestational age was 25-40 weeks. There was no death associated with COVID-19 in pregnant women. The obstetric outcomes in pregnant women with COVID-19 include decreased fetal movement, intrauterine fetal distress, anemia, PROM, preterm labor, Multiple Organ Dysfunction Syndrome (MODS) and etc. The most common delivery mode in women affect with COVID-19 was cesarean section. Expect for one case with MODS, in the majority of the studies reviewed, no severe morbidity or mortality occurred. The neonatal outcomes were stillbirth, prematurity, asphyxia, fetal distress, low birth weight, small for gestational age, large for gestational age, multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, disseminated intravascular coagulation and neonatal death. In addition, five neonates born to mothers with COVID-19 were positive for SARS-CoV-2. However, the studies report these outcomes but the exact causes of theme are not known. Conclusion: In this systematic review, we summarize the diverse results of studies about the obstetrics and neonatal outcomes following COVID-19. This infection may cause negative outcomes in both mothers and neonates. However, there were evidence about neonate infected with COVID-19, but there is controversial information about the vertical transmission of COVID-19.",

These viruses can cause respiratory, intestinal, liver, and nervous system diseases (1, 2) . In December 2019, a high incidence of pneumonia with unknown causes was detected in Wuhan, China in January 2020 and the scientists identified the cause of this pneumonia as a new type of coronavirus called SARS-Cov-2 as the cause of 2019 novel coronavirus infectious disease (COVID-19) (3). This virus belongs to the family Coronaviridae from the Nidovirales order (4) . The transmission route of this virus similar to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), occurs via respiratory droplets and secretions thought nosocomial contacts (5) . The incidence of COVID-19 and pneumonia related to it is higher in people with weakened immune systems, such as the elderly, people with underlying diseases, and pregnant women (6) . The immunological changes during pregnancy period put the pregnant women at high risk group (7) . The increased risk of viral pneumonia during pregnancy is also attributed to physiological changes that are responsible for shift cellular immunity to humoral immunity; moreover, pregnant women do not tolerate severe pneumonia combined with a significant reduction in ventilation capacity as well as non-pregnant women (8, 9) . Fetuses also poorly tolerate hypoxemia and acidosis, and these complications induce preterm labor (9) . Studies showed the high rates of maternal mortality, stillbirth, abortion, and preterm labor after viral pneumonia caused by the influenza A, H1N1, MERS, and SARS viruses (10) (11) (12) . Despite the criticality of these conditions, however, information on the impact of COVID-19 on obstetrics and newborn outcomes is very limited. Despite the researchers reported some pregnancy complications of COVID-19 (6, (13) (14) (15) (16) (17) but be-cause the obstetricians and pediatricians need to comprehensive information about the obstetric and neonatal effect of COVID-19, so this review study was conducted to investigate the impact of COVID-19 on obstetrics and neonatal outcomes.",

The checklist includes five subcategories of goal reporting, diagnostic criteria, clinical techniques and methods, and symptom reporting, factors related to clinical existence, and the authors' conclusions (19) .",

In all participants, diagnosis of COVID-19 was confirmed by using laboratory tests and/or imaging examinations. All studies were published in China from December 8, 2019 to March 26, 2020. The qualities of three studies were satisfactory and the qualities of the remaining studies were excellent. After reviewing included studies, the findings were categorized ob-stetrics and neonatal outcomes and signs and symptoms in neonates and mothers represented in Table 1 . ",

If the mother is severely or critically ill, separation should be considered (35) . The result of a review showed that in SARS vertical transmission were not seen (36) .
