It is endangering the health of millions of people, and resulting in severe socioeconomic challenges due to lock-down measures. Governments worldwide aim to devise exit strategies to revive the economy while keeping the pandemic under control. The problem is that the effects of distinct measures are not well quantified. This paper compares several suppression approaches and potential exit strategies using a new extended epidemic SEIR model. It concludes that while rapid and strong lock-down is an effective pandemic suppression measure, a combination of other strategies such as social distancing, active protection and removal can achieve similar suppression synergistically. This quantitative understanding will support the establishment of mid-and long-term interventions.

To suppress the spread of the virus and to prevent dramatic situations in the healthcare systems, many countries have implemented rigorous measures for a general lock-down. Evaluation of the epidemic status and forecast of future development is based on statistical methods and on epidemiological models. While statistical methods allow for accurate characterization of the population's health state, epidemiological modeling can provide more detailed mechanisms for the epidemic dynamics and allow investigating how epidemics will develop under different assumptions. A classical epidemiological model is the SEIR model, that considers individuals transitioning from Susceptible \u2192 Exposed \u2192 Infectious \u2192 Removed state during the epidemics (Anderson and May, 1979) . Its essential control parameter is the basic reproduction number R 0 (Legrand et al., 2007) . Worldwide general suppression strategies against the current COVID-19 pandemic aim at reducing this quantity. To improve R 0 estimation, this paper develops an extended SEIR model. It incorporates additional compartments reflecting different intervention strategies. In particular, the model focuses on three main suppression programs: social distancing (lowering the rate of social contacts), active protection (lowering the number of susceptible people), and active removal of latent carriers (Anderson et al., 2020) . This study investigates how these programs achieve repression both individually and combined. This information can supply Government decisions, helping to avoid overloading the healthcare system and to minimise stressing the economic system (associated with lock-down).

They assume homogeneous propagation media (or fully connected graphs) and focus on the evolution of mean properties of the closed system. Although more realistic versions exist, e.g. SEIR with delay (Yan and Liu, 2006) , spatial coupling (Arino et al., 2005) , or individual-based models (Ferguson et al., 2006) , these models are classical tools to investigate the principal mechanisms governing the spread of infections and their dynamics. Main compartments of SEIR models (see Fig. 1 , framed) are: susceptible S (the pool of individuals likely to be infected), exposed E (corresponding to latent carriers of the infection), infectious I (individuals having developed the disease and being contagious) and removed R (those that have processed the disease, being either recovered or dead). The model's default parameters are the average contact rate \u03b2, the inverse of incubation period \u03b1, and the average duration of contagious period \u03b3. When focusing on infection dynamics rather than patients' fate, the latter combines recovery and death rate (Noorani, 2010) . From these parameters, epidemiologists calculate the \"basic reproduction number\" R 0 = \u03b2/\u03b3 (Fraser et al., 2009 ) at the epidemic beginning. During the epidemic progression, isolation after diagnosis, vaccination campaigns and active suppression measures are in action.

Notably, the new compartments P (protected) and Q (quarantined) open the classical SEIR closed system by a negative flux out of the original mass-conserving model. An additional link from Q to R, even though realistic, is neglected as both compartments are already outside the \"contagion system\" and would be therefore redundant from the perspective of infectious evolution.

The model has in total 6 parameters. Three of them (\u03b2, \u03b1, \u03b3 in Fig. 1 ) are based on the classical SEIR model. The new parameters \u03c1, \u00b5, \u03c7 account for alternative repression programs (see Table 1 for details). Commonly, social distancing is modeled by the parameter \u03c1. It tunes the contact rate parameter \u03b2, resulting in the effective reproduction numberR = \u03c1\u00b7\u03b2\u03b3 \u22121 . This occurs in a closed-system setting where all individuals belong to the susceptible pool but interact less intensively with each other. The parameter \u00b5 stably decreases the susceptible population by introducing an active protection rate. This accounts for improvements of public health, e.g. stricter lock-down of communities, or physical reduction of a country's population like reduced commuters' activity. This changes the effective reproduction number intoR = \u03b2\u03b3 \u22121 (1\u2212\u00b5) T with T being the number of days the measures are effective (Peng et al., 2020) . The parameter \u03c7 introduces an active removal rate of latent carriers. Intensive contact tracing and improved methods to detect asymptomatic latent carriers may enhance the removal of exposed subjects from the infectious network. Following earlier work (Heffernan et al., 2005; Li et al., 1999) and adjusting the current parameters,R can be then expressed asR = \u03b2\u03b3 \u22121 \u03b1 (\u03b1 + \u03c7) \u22121 . Parameter values that are not related to suppression strategies are taken from recent COVID-19 epidemic literature (Kucharski et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2020b) .

Different synergies lead to different timing, even though the peak is contained similarly (Fig. 7a) . This has an impact on the cumulative number of cases (Fig. 7b ) that will be reflected on the death toll. This holds even when theR values are very close, as in scenarios 1 to 4. Focusing on scenarios 2 and 3, we notice that prevention measures and latents quarantine accelerate the suppression, even when isolating only vulnerable people. This achieves similar effects as strong social distancing. In addition, active protective measures with relatively low values further concur in suppressing the peak. This finding asks for rapid assessment of masks and sanitising routines. Overall, the strength of suppression measures influences how and how fast the epidemic is flattened. AnR < 1 suffices to avoid breakdown of the health system, but its effects could be too slow for the economic system. Decreasing its value with synergistic interventions could speed up epidemic suppression. Given the importance of magnitudes in achieving suppression, it is hardly conceivable to transfer 7 .

They have different effects on epidemic evolution in terms of curve flattening and eradication timing. As with previous studies (Ferguson et al., 2020; Peak et al., 2020) , we have observed the need to enforce mitigation measures (i.e., slow down viral spread in the community with social distancing) along with containment (i.e., detect and isolate cases, identify and quarantine contacts and at risk neighborhoods). By extending the classic SEIR model into the SPQEIR model, we distinguished the impact of different repression programs in flattening the peak and anticipating the eradication of the epidemic. Depending on their strength and synergy, non-pharmaceutical interventions can hamper the disease from spreading in a population. It is now necessary to move from idealised representations to realistic scenarios and to map policy measures to abstract programs. This will require ad-hoc or post-hoc quantification of specific interventions, e.g. how effective masks are in protecting people, how much proximity tracing apps increase P f ind , how changes in behavior are associated with epidemic decline (Cowling et al., 2020) and so on. Some real measures might also affect multiple parameters at once, e.g. safety devices and lock-down could impact both \u00b5 and \u03c1. Their assessment is demanded to close discussions between modelers and experts of public hygiene. We also acknowledge that practical implementations have to consider available resources in crisis periods. A word of caution: the present model aims at informing researchers and policy-makers by examining possible abstract scenarios and comparing quantitative, model-based outputs. It is not intended to faithfully represent specific countries nor to fully reproduce the epidemic complexity within societies. Any conclusion should be carefully interpreted by experts, and the feasibility of tested scenarios should be discussed before reaching consensus. Overall, this work could contribute to quantitative assessments of epidemic repression strategies.
