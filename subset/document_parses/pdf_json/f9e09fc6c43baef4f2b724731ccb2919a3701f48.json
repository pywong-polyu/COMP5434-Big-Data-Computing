About 80% of patients remain in the best condition for five years after being diagnosed with this type of cancer. Air pollution is one of the main causes of this disease. Early diagnosis of lung disease will have a major impact on the likelihood of definitive treatment of the disease. Major diagnostic methods for lung cancer include imaging, radiography and CT scan, biopsy, bronchoscopy, and examination of the breast mucosa. Pulmonary nodule is a small, round, opaque mass that forms inside the lung tissue. In other words, nodules are spherical radiographic opacities less than 30 mm in diameter. So far, various researches have been done in order to identify and describe lung diseases. Due to the removal and high number of radiographic images of the lungs, as well as its complex and uneven structure, it is difficult for a specialist physician to diagnose nodules from vessels, wounds, etc. A computer diagnostic aid system is a system that assists a physician in diagnosing a disease. Such systems are used as an intelligent tool that expresses a second option to the radiologist, which shows suspicious situations in the images to the radiologist and thus helps the radiologist to make the most accurate diagnosis. e basic idea is not to leave the diagnosis to a machine, but to use it because it increases the sensitivity of the work and reduces the rate of positive error. Several works were introduced in this subject.",

Afterward, the output of the network is compared with the desired output to achieve the amount of Computational Intelligence and Neuroscience the error value. en, the weights and biases are selected to minimize this value. e training of the network parameters can be established based on two ways: training after each training sample which is called \"sequential,\" or the training updated after applying all of the training samples which is called \"batch.\" e first method needs less memory, but, it has less stability because each training sample can address the network parameters into a new direction. In the second method, although it needs more memory for storing the parameters, it will have more stability. erefore, in the following, we used the batch mode. In this study, we use batches with scale 32 to train the database images. In the deep neural network's architecture, 3 numbers of \"convolutional\" layers and three numbers of \"max pooling\" layers have been used. Figure 4 shows the total architecture. e convolutional layer contains the main kernel of the CNN, and output mass can be as a 3D mass of neurons. Convolution is a mathematical operation for the process of the signal that is utilized for applying the convolutional operations to the inputs by the neurons. e most important parameter in the convolutional layers is their filter size where, in the proposed model, the three layers of 32 \u00d7 32, 64 \u00d7 64, and 128 \u00d7 128 have been used. After the convolutional layer, to reduce the special size (depth), pooling layer has been utilized. is helps to decrease the parameters numbers and to increase the network speed. e pooling layers reduce the number of the output layers of the filter. In this study, we used 2 \u00d7 2 filter for this purpose. Indeed, the main idea is to subsample the input image to reduce the complexity cost, memory, and the number of parameters in the network. e size reduction of the input image also decreases the sensitivity of the neural network. In the pooling layer, like convolutional layer, each neuron is connected to the output of some neurons. To reduce the size and increase the computation speed, pooling layer for sampling is used. In this research, the pooling layer with a 2 \u00d7 2 window steps on the image. From the four existing pixels in this window, the maximum pixel is selected and transferred to the next layer. e method of max pooling is shown in Figure 5 . After each convolutional layer, an activation layer is used where its target is to introduce nonlinear operations to a system that completely computed the linear operations in the computational layers [13] .",

Research by scientists has shown that the early detection of this disease makes it easier to treat, and the risk of death from this disease is reduced. In this article, we will discuss a new method for early detection of lung cancer. Here, an automatic system based on deep neural networks was proposed for optimal diagnosis of the CTbased lung images, in medical images. e proposed method used a metaheuristic technique, called marine predators algorithm for optimal arrangement and better network accuracy. Due to the extraction of the high-level features based on deep networks in the proposed method, the classification and diagnosis accuracy were high. Moreover, the feature vector size was reduced, and in the initial steps, its accuracy was increased that accordingly reduced the saving space and increased the speed and accuracy. In the future work, we study modifying the proposed method to provide the system with higher speed to be feasible in the real-time application.",
