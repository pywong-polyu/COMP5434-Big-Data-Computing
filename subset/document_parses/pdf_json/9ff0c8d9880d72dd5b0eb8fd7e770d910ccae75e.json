            "text": "The patterns of respiratory virus illness are expressed differently between temperate and tropical climates. Tropical outbreaks often peak in wet seasons. Temperate outbreaks typically peak during the winter. The prevailing causal hypotheses focus on sunlight, temperature and humidity variations. Yet no consistent factors have been identified to sufficiently explain seasonal virus emergence and decline at any latitude. Here we demonstrate close connections among global-scale atmospheric circulations, IgE antibody enhancement through seasonal pollen inhalation, and respiratory virus patterns at any populated latitude, with a focus on the US. Pollens emerge each Spring, and the renewed IgE titers in the population are argued to terminate each winter peak of respiratory illness. Globally circulated airborne viruses are postulated to subsequently deposit across the Southern US during lower zonal geostrophic winds each late Summer. This seasonally refreshed viral load is postulated to trigger a new influenza outbreak, once the existing IgE antibodies diminish to a critical value each Fall. Our study offers a new and consistent explanation for the seasonal diminishment of respiratory viral illnesses in temperate climates, the subdued seasonal signature in the tropics, the annually circulated virus phenotypes, and the northerly migration of influenza across the US every year. Our integrated geospatial and IgE hypothesis provides a new perspective for prediction, mitigation and prevention of the outbreak and spread of seasonal respiratory viruses including Covid-19 pandemic.",

Interestingly, much like any SRV vaccine, the antigenic reaction triggered by pollen is also accompanied by the production of antibodies 4 . The well-known IgE antibody emergence over pollen season appears to affect all who are exposed, whether or not they develop allergies 5 . These antigenic reactions from pollen are not widely credited for diminishing ILI, perhaps because the associated IgE antibodies are not found in significant concentrations in human subjects other than during pollen season. Yet cross reactivity of antibodies is a common research area, and some publications have identified this attribution for IgE to counter SRVs 6,7 as well as potentially for the treatment of tumors 8 . This suggests that although larger than viruses, pollens trigger IgEs and, once the IgE titers in a population rise, this antibody type might also target SRVs.",

            "text": "It has been suggested that viruses as drifting \"accumulation mode\" particles could be widely distributed through the atmosphere and could circulate in part according to their sizes 9 . We recognize that this conceptualization is consistent with the Navier Stokes formulation of fluid flow and particle transport. The vertical settling velocity of any small particle as described by the Stokes equation (Eq. 1, described subsequently) is also countered by the lift of particles as a function of the wind speed via the Reynolds number 10 . Typical atmospheric residence times of bioaerosols including viruses and pollens are outlined in Table 1 and Fig. 1 . Wet removal of aerosol particles through atmospheric precipitation is illustrated by the graded blue shading. The susceptibility of a particle to washout increases with its particle size. Given average dimensions of 0.1 micron, viruses are more prone to lift and less prone to sedimentation than larger particles. As a result, their environmental range extends from the surface to the region above the Planetary Boundary Layer (PBL), approximately 1000 m above the Earth's surface. Accordingly, viruses exhibit the longest atmospheric residencies among the categories considered. Given that atmospheric velocities typically range from a few meters per second slightly above the planet's surface to 70 m per second above the PBL, viruses lofted high in the atmosphere along certain tracks are expected to circulate globally around the Earth several times a month. In contrast, pollen dimensions are several orders of magnitude larger, ranging roughly from 10 to 100 microns, and accordingly have much lower atmospheric residence times. These particles would rapidly settle out of the atmosphere simply by gravity and rainfall. As noted, pollens are of significant interest in this investigation due to indications that they possess immunological properties against seasonal respiratory viruses SRVs 7 .",

            "text": "No seasonal ILI studies to date have considered pollen in concert with global circulation of viruses in the atmosphere. Agent-based transmission from host to host remains the primary conceptual model for virus spread, as demonstrated in the widespread use of Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious, and Recovered (SEIR) models 19 . Some of these models have considered the atmospheric survivability of SRVs. For example, recent work 1, 3 proposed that humid air diminishes transmission of an influenza virus in temperate zones. Yet rainy seasons in tropical regimes are also humid seasons, and those can be the times in those latitudes when influenza is most prevalent. Other studies that factored in the atmospheric transport of bioaerosols sought to explain episodes of sudden and extensive viral outbreaks covering vast regions 9 . Whon et al. 20 first reported the seasonality of airborne viruses and their genetic diversity across regions of South Korea. Recent investigations by Reche et al. 21 further demonstrated the exceptional variety and intensity of viral flux from above, through the PBL at two sites within Spain's Sierra Nevada Mountains. Although the circulation of viruses around the planet is no longer controversial, the application of this knowledge to better understanding SRV outbreak and spread has not been extensively explored. Some work has pointed out intriguing seasonal and geographic patterns of flu onset across tropical locations including Brazil [22] [23] [24] . As noted in Tamerius et al. 23 , the rainiest periods across Brazil highly correlate to flu outbreaks. Moreover, the flu season is described to originate at the northern boundary of Brazil in the tropical latitudes by April and migrate towards the south, in the subtropical latitudes over several months every year 24 . Those studies also assume an agent-based transmission paradigm, and accordingly ILI patterns were believed to initiate or intensify from a weather feature but not spread further due to climate. Furthermore, both the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have on occasion noted a geospatial pattern of south to north migration of flus in temperate climates 25, 26 . That pattern is accordingly somewhat symmetric to the reported Brazilian ILI pattern. A confirmation of this migration direction within the US is found in Charu et al. 27 where the authors noted \"seven of eight (ILI) epidemics likely originated in the Southern US\".",

The tropical regions are accordingly known for \"pollen rain\", where pollen falls directly to the ground from the overlying tree canopy. Pollen rains explain why regional pollen collection in tropical zones are challenging 28 . In contrast, temperate Albuquerque's two pollen stations (mapped in Fig. 2b ) provided an extensive record of a wide variety of wind-mediated pollens. Moreover, the influenza surveillance for that city covered a similar time span and resolution. As shown in Fig. 2c , two pollen time series (blue and green dots) and one ILI series (red dots), were accordingly developed based upon resources provided directly by the New Mexico Department of Health 30 for ILI, and the City of Albuquerque 31 for pollen. As indicated in Fig. 2b , the two Albuquerque pollen stations were placed to monitor environmentally distinct locations, one for the west mesa region and the other in the residential northeast, near the base of the Sandia Mountains. The west station is more exposed to westerly winds crossing unirrigated lands and has lower pollen levels (green) than the urban eastern pollen station (blue). By virtue of the general arid environment, both series show lower ranges of pollen than many other sites throughout the wetter central and eastern US. Figure S6a charts raw Albuquerque time series for a selection of pollen types. Figure S6b further complements the ILI patterns over time by the addition of ILI series representing NM's quadrants. The NM ILI information is also shared with the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the development of their \"FLUView\" ILI dashboard 32 .

In contrast, no consistent trends have been observed for pollens 33 . Given the size and source of pollen particles (Fig. 1) , their concentration trends are likely to be controlled by local environmental factors.",

            "text": "The data from Albuquerque, US and Fortaleza, Brazil clearly indicate a close association of pollen emergence and decline with viral outbreak episodes in both climate regimes (Fig. 2 ). Just as with ILIs, airborne pollen concentrations rise and fall exponentially within any given year, with each ILI peak occurring between two successive pollen peaks. Other seasonal variables, both surface and geostrophic, rise and fall significantly across any year (Fig. S7a,b) . For both locations, Evaporation minus Precipitation (EP) for the full atmosphere (\"geostrophic rain\") closely follow the surface rainfall (Fig. S7 ), thus adding confidence to the use of geostrophic information in correlating weather to SRVs. As shown in Fig. S7a and b, many aspects of the Albuquerque and Fortaleza climatological curves are similar when factoring in a two-to-three-month shift in general, as well as the North American Monsoon (NAM) impact on rainfall in Albuquerque. Pollen emergence coincides with the decline of viral spread in both climate regimes (Fig. 2a) Albuquerque ILI count 30 and normalized geostrophic wind 35 , and geostrophic 35 www.nature.com/scientificreports/ late fall and winter because pollens are not produced then. Over heavy rainy seasons in tropical zones, airborne pollens are also diminished due to washout. As discussed above, while viruses can be transported by upper atmosphere circulation over extended periods, pollens are expected to be controlled by local climatological factors. This is supported by Albuquerque data. Figure 3a and b show the comparisons of surface winds to pollen concentrations (top panel) and of ILI to geostrophic winds (bottom panel). In these figures the raw datasets were interpolated into weekly increments to cover available spans up through the past two decades. Figure 3a confirms an anticipated synchrony between surface winds (solid green curve) and pollen loads (transparent green curve), and a closer synchrony for the final decade. Figure 3b shows an equally strong synchrony between ILI percentages (red curve) and geostrophic winds (dotted green curve) as well as inverted temperatures, both geostrophic and surface (dotted and solid pink curves, respectively). Figure 3b summarizes the correlation analysis of pollens, winds, temperatures and precipitations to monthly ILIs at both Albuquerque (bright red) and Fortaleza (maroon) using the Pearson's method. The monthly lags for each correlation are indicated in black. Because all variables are normalized first and there are 12 entries per variable for each test, any R value greater than 0.5 is statistically significant. It is not surprising that SRVs and each category of weather and pollen variable are correlated, but that the strength and direction of the correlation relations can vary between temperate and tropical locations. Tamerius 23 indicated a high correlation between ILIs and rainfall at Fortaleza, which is confirmed in Fig. 3b by the high correlation coefficients of geostrophic and surface rain to ILIs with no time lag. For Albuquerque, the low lag high correlations (whether positive or negative) were found for winds and temperatures. Precipitation is also found to correlate, but only at certain lags. This is attributed to the NAM which reaches Albuquerque every late summer. For Albuquerque pollen, although the peak month occurs two months after the peak ILI month, the diminishment of ILIs and the emergence (as opposed to the peak) of a high pollen level are highly correlated practically with no time lag, both for Albuquerque and Fortaleza (Fig. 2a) . Moreover, the figure demonstrates a 6 month lag between peak pollen and the subsequence re-emergence of ILI for both locations. It is reasonable to expect that any primary factor controling virus seasonality would exhibit a consistent correlation with ILIs for both locations. Accordingly correlations would express either the same signs or the opposite signs with a time lag of ~ 0 or 6 months. From Figs. 2a and 3b, only three factors are identified to be possible candiates: pollen, geostrophic wind, and surface temperature. As shown below, the surface temperature can further be eliminated.",

States east of the continental divide which are best aligned to the northern and southern boundaries of the US were identified, and ILI information was developed accordingly from the CDC's FLUView resource 32 .

Figure 4a presents timelines of ILIs for those two data bands, which indicate that ILIs persist throughout the whole year in both southern and northern bands, but the northern band expresses significantly lower ILI rates.

Accordingly, the emergence slopes of ILI and of pollen are nearly identical, at approximately 5 days/degree latitude, for both ILI and pollens (grass and oak pollens). Because of the constant slope, the pollen emergence precedes the subsequent SRV emergence by 6 months, regardless of the temperate latitude.

However, as shown in Fig. 4 , warmer regions emerge into a flu season before colder zones. In addition, it is evident that in the Western US, sunshine remains abundant throughout the winter even as flu outbreaks appear to parallel those in the eastern US.

As shown in Table 1 , because of the particle size difference, viruses would settle far more slowly than pollen particles in the air, leading to a long residence time for viruses in the atmosphere. Conversely, a much smaller uplifting wind velocity is required to lift virus particles in the air than pollens. The proposed geostrophic circulation mechanism for virus renewal is consistent with our correlation analysis (see Fig. 3b ), which identifies the geostrophic wind as an important covariate. After virus seeding from the atmosphere, a conventional SEIR model can then be used to explain the remaining part of virus transmission within a population over that season. The geostrophic circulation and pollen-based notions introduced in this study therefore offer a somewhat challenging but possibly complementary concept to an agent-based model.",

            "text": "The atmospheric seeding concept seems supported by the geostrophic wind pattern observed in the US. The July-August summer monsoonal pattern of Fig. 4c is distinctive, because lower geostrophic winds are coincident with the southern US state band. Given that July follows the season of peak pollination, the lower zonal winds are therefore understood to signify a period of extensive airborne pollen washout and perhaps extensive airborne virus deposition, leading to an earlier Fall viral outbreak in the south. Subsequently, as the Fall geostrophic winds intensify (Figs. S4 and S5) , an effective large-scale virus circulation may be re-established, contributing to a large-scale virus circulation and therefore a highly synchronized peak ILI between the two geographic bands Fig. 4a (see more \"Discussions\" section below). Therefore, the patterns of SRV outbreak and spread can be consistently explained by considering large-scale virus transport and local-scale pollen cycles. This large-scale virus circulation may explain observations by Reche et al. 21 that virus loads monitored in southern Spain often arrive from over the Atlantic Ocean. As noted in the southern band of US states (Figs. 4c and S2-S5), low geostrophic wind levels prevail over the later summer, and those winds are part of a larger atmospheric gyre rooted in the Atlantic Ocean as well. The potential \"pooling\" of the general atmospheric virus load can be further distinguished in comparison to expected conditions of the northern state locations in Fig. 4c . That northern band is aligned with the well-known North American Jet Stream, evident by the lighter color tones of the map. With stronger lateral winds comes greater lift. Whatever the transport mechanism, and depending on further observations and confirmation, a greater concentration of viral particles across the broad and diverse surfaces of the southern US every summer might then ultimately explain the greater intensity of ILI each winter in the southern band.",

Again, this virus-wind explanation is consistent with the study by Reche et al. 21 . Those researchers indicated that viruses appeared to have longer residence times than the larger bacteria. Moreover, they noted a significant sedimentation of virus across their study area in Southern Spain over August.

            "text": "Antigenic properties of pollen. We noted in the Introduction that although larger than viruses, pollens trigger IgEs and, once the IgE titers in a population rise, this antibody type might also target SRVs. In other words, a virus might not trigger the production of an IgE antibody, but once those antibodies have emerged, they may challenge SRVs. The concept that an IgE antibody could challenge an SRV appears to be largely unexplored, given that the majority of SRV vaccination research and development is tailored towards IgA, IgG, and IgM antibodies. Yet in Fig. 5a which reproduces common representations of antibodies, those epitopes are similar in geometry and composition to the IgE epitope. Moreover, the antigen-binding peptides (blue and violet components), are the same for all, at this level of detail. Table 1 of Roux 40 and diagrams and immunoelectron micrographs of Roux et al. 41 further confirm the geometric similarities between IgG, IgA, IgM, and IgE, including dimensions and angular degrees of freedom and flexibilities. Moreover, Sutton et al. 8 indicates that IgE antibodies may be the most flexible of all types. Finally as noted in the previous sections, the numbers of cases of ILI in temperate latitudes uniformly recede when pollens become airborne. The recession continues in alignment with the half-life of many antibodies, typically covering only a few months 37 . Antigen-triggered IgE antibodies provide a mechanistic explanation for this seasonal phenomenon. www.nature.com/scientificreports/ Those flying creatures happen to have the greatest mobilities and most extensive migrations through the atmosphere, where primary viral loads likely always reside. It may also be remarkable that, for several orders of wild migratory birds, including Anseriformes (including ducks) in North America, and Charadriiformes (including gulls), the prevalence of SRVs has been observed to be highest and lowest at approximately the same months as for humans in North America. In other words, avian flus appear to emerge in early fall and to decline in the following Spring 45 . Thus, avian flu patterns appear to be another manifestation of the proposed geostrophic circulation-pollen cycle regulated viral outbreak and spread mechanism. By considering large-scale virus transport and pollen-induced immunity, the conventional SEIR model can be modified into a new environmentally influenced transmission model: where x, y and z are the spatial coordinates with z pointing upward from the land surface; C v is the virus concentration in the air; D is the dispersion coefficient tensor of a SRV in the geostrosphic layer; C p is the pollen concentration, determined by local monitoring; \u21c0 V is the velocity field of geostrosphic wind; N is the total population at geographic location (x, y); N S , N I , and N Im are the susceptible, infected and immunized populations, respectively;",

Then in under 2 years, the strain www.nature.com/scientificreports/ no longer prevailed over the summer in the US 54 .

The recent limitations which have been applied to surveillance and to SRV geospatial reporting, may now challenge the completeness and/or accuracy of any near term geospatial updates.

Given the added but largely unexamined potential that pollens might act as a type of broad-spectrum immunogen, this research points in general to possible improvements to the existing SRV forecasting, prevention and mitigation. More broadly, the potential role of pollens can be viewed as a specific example of a new general concept of environmental immunity in which the ambient environment may endow a local population with a natural resistance to viral infection. Since both environmental immunity and viruses constantly evolve with time, a better understanding of their interplay would be critical for prediction, mitigation and prevention of outbreak and spread of seasonal respiratory viruses including the current Covid-19 pandemic.
