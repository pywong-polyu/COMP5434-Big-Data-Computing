[5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] To achieve health equity, there is a pressing need to understand how to implement evidence-based interventions. 14 Dissemination and implementation research methods can tailor programs to address needs at multiple levels as health disparities develop due to complex determinants across the individual, interpersonal, community, and environmental levels. [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] Late-stage (T4) implementation research identifies strategies to achieve sustainable uptake of proveneffective interventions into routine clinical practice and communitybased settings and maximizes impact on population health. 20 In 2020, the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI) created and funded the Disparities Elimination through Coordinated Interventions to Prevent and Control Heart and Lung Disease Risk (DECIPHeR) Alliance to support late-stage T4 implementation research strategies for optimal implementation and sustainment of evidence-based multi-level interventions to reduce disparities in communities with a high burden of cardiovascular and/or pulmonary risk factors. DECIPHeR is funded as a cooperative agreement using the UG3/UH3 administrative mechanism. During an initial 3-year UG3 planning phase, project teams engage partner communities to identify programs and health areas of most importance for implementation strategies and to identify strategies most appropriate and effective in the community. If milestones for the initial UG3 phase are achieved, a subsequent 4-year UH3 phase will conduct a prospective study of implementation strategies refined and adapted through the UG3 phase. Here we describe the DECIPHeR Alliance with an overview of study designs, disparities populations, evidencebased interventions, planned implementation strategies, and outcomes as well as the organizational structure promoting cross-center partnership and collaboration. At this early stage of the project, the approach to the research planned for the UH3 phase remains flexible and will likely change as information from our communities and their barriers and facilitators expands.",

In the LAC Department of Health Services (DHS) 43% of patients have hypertension, of which 60% are inadequately controlled. The study will focus on racial/ethnic populations within LAC DHS with high rates of hypertension, including Latino (42%), African Americans (48%), Chinese (31%), Filipino (62%), and Korean (34%) populations. Population differences in healthy eating, physical activity, obesity, and antihypertensive pharmacotherapy use, medication adherence, community awareness of hypertension, and communitylevel physical and social resources contribute to disparities in blood pressure (BP) control. In partnership with 51 adult primary care clinics in LAC DHS, we plan to significantly reduce hypertension disparities by leveraging our team's expertise in multi-ethnic, multi-level evidence-based strategies, community/stakeholder engagement, public-private partnerships, implementation science, and behavioral economics. Using the Exploration, Preparation, Implementation, Sustainment (EPIS) framework, we are planning a multi-level intervention for hypertension control that will complete Exploration/ Preparation stages in the UG3 phase and the Implementation/ Sustainment stages in the UH3 phase. 21 Through patient and stakeholder interviews, we will first assess multi-level (patient, clinician, health system leadership, and community) barriers to, facilitators of, and preferences for a menu of culturally tailored evidencebased practices and sustainable implementation strategies with established efficacy for hypertension control (Aim 1; UG3). Our initial focus will be on medication therapy management, home BP monitoring, and cultural adaptation of lifestyle modification with support from community health workers. We will then link preferred multilevel (patient-, clinician-, or community-directed) implementation strategies to behavioral science approaches, for example, patient incentives to attend initial pharmacy visits or clinician peer comparisons for patient BP control. (Aim 2; UG3) To test the effectiveness of these behavioral-science linked implementation strategies, we plan a stepped-wedge cluster randomized trial design using RE-AIM to guide assessment of uncontrolled hypertension, and BP disparities in comparison to non-minority LAC populations, and evidence-based practices. 22 The effectiveness outcomes are BP control in the electronic health record (primary), medication adherence, and costs. The implementation outcomes are acceptability of the intervention components and sustainment of the intervention strategies and BP control.",

The EPIS is used for developing intervention program and implementation strategies and the RE-AIM for evaluating study outcomes. 25, 26 Implementation strategies include CHW-led health coaching on lifestyle changes and medication adherence; church-based exercise and weight loss programs; self-monitoring of physical activity, BP, and glucose; and provider education and engagement. The primary effectiveness outcome is the difference in proportion of participants having \u22654 ideal or improved CVH metrics, 27 defined as a healthy diet score of 4-5 components or increase of 2 components from baseline; 150 min/week moderate-or 75 min/week vigorous-intensity physical activity or a combination; never smoking or quitting \u22656 months ago; BMI <25 kg/m 2 or weight loss \u226510 pounds; A1c <7.0% (or <8.0% with complications); use of statin therapy as appropriate; and BP <130/80 mmHg or systolic BP reduced by \u226510 mmHg.

The DECIPHeR Alliance's organizational structure promotes cross-center partnership and collaboration and the project's study designs, populations, evidence-based interventions, planned implementation strategies, and outcomes as currently planned.

We define asthma \"hot spots\" as regions with both high rates of uncontrolled asthma and high levels of socioeconomic need. Using community-based participatory methods with stakeholders representing schools, clinics, families and public health in each region, we will adapt our Col-SBAP that reduces asthma exacerbations and missed school days to meet the needs, priorities, practices, and resources of these diverse communities. 32, [35] [36] [37] The EPIS framework is being applied during our Planning phase of the UG3 award with community stakeholders to iteratively adapt our current implementation guide into a set of common implementation strategies that meet local community and school setting needs. 26 During the exploration phase, we are conducting meetings with stakeholders in our five targeted regions of Colorado to understand the needs, resources, and outcomes of success. We are using this information in the Preparation Phase to develop implementation strategies for each region tailored for their abilities to conduct the Col-SBAP as well as access and manage SDOH for their school children with asthma who suffer health disparities. We will use this information to design and conduct a cluster-randomized trial in participating regions in the Implementation Phase, using a randomized stepped-wedge study design to compare two interventional elements with a control population: (1) our original evidence-based Col-SBAP that addresses a targeted subset of SDOH that limit health care access, and (2) a comprehensive assessment and case management approach to SDOH. This complex, combined program is termed Stop Asthma Attacks (SAA). Meanwhile, for the Sustainment Phase, we intend that the interventional elements will be designed for T A B L E 1 (Continued) sustainable delivery by school nurses, in partnership with trained asthma navigators who provide \"high-touch\" care coordination with students/families, primary care and community SDOH resources. 38 We will also work with the community stakeholders to identify the appropriate support to sustain the program (Table A1 ). We will have to determine what capacity each region has for sustaining the Col-SBAP and/or the SAA Program. The central hypothesis is that SAA will have broad and equitable Reach (primary outcome) and yield important benefits in reducing asthma attacks and symptoms, as compared to schools that have not yet implemented SAA. Cost effectiveness of each program will also be assessed.",

Using Proctor's Implementation Outcomes Framework, the implementation phase will evaluate the impact of PACE on BP control, adoption and fidelity at 18 months compared to usual care (UC) via a stepped-wedge cluster RCT of 20 NYU PCPs in 500 Black patients with uncontrolled hypertension. The project includes partnership with a payer (Healthfirst) to assess cost-effectiveness and inform the sustainability and scalability of integrated community-clinical linkage models. We hypothesize that rates of BP control and costeffectiveness will be higher during the PACE intervention period than during the UC period at 18 months and that rates of BP control will be higher in practices that exhibit higher levels of adoption and implementation fidelity of PACE at 18 months. Payer reimbursement mechanisms will be explored to sustain and scale the model across the NYU health system. 71 Life Goals is a self-management-focused intervention that aims to help individuals cope with mood symptoms and improve health by using healthy behavior changes such as physical activity and eating habits and also incorporates care coordination. 72 Replicating Effective Programs (REP) Framework components will lay the groundwork alongside Coaching and Facilitation implementation strategies, addressing provider and organizational barriers respectively. 72 In the first phase, we are partnering with community mental health programs in Maryland and Michigan to tailor IDEAL/Life Goals and implementation strategies to fit site needs. In the second phase, we plan to conduct a nonrestricted SMART with these community mental health programs to determine the effectiveness of Coaching and Facilitation augmentations to REP on IDEAL/Life Goals delivery, risk factor care quality and control, assessing mechanisms, moderators, and other implementation measures.",

While behavioral health homes have shown improved cardiovascular risk factor screening, to date they have not resulted in risk factor improvement, likely because they are not implementing evidencebased interventions. 67 The overarching project goal is to partner with Michigan and Maryland communities serving persons with serious mental illness to improve uptake of (IDEAL) and Life Goals evidence-based interventions to reduce cardiovascular risk in behavioral health homes. 68-70 IDEAL is a comprehensive cardiovascular risk reduction intervention consisting of individual education and counseling sessions and care coordination/care management addressing all CVD risk factors.",
