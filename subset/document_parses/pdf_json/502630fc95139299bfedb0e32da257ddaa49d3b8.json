Correlation studies and logistic regression models were performed that adjusted for age and gender to evaluate the association between hyponatremia and hsCRP level. The associations between hyponatremia and clinical outcomes (i.e., ICU admission, use of mechanical ventilation, in-hospital death) were assessed with unadjusted and multivariable logistic regression models that included variables associated with death using backward stepwise selection (retention P-value < 0.2). The association of hyponatremia and all-cause inhospital death at 30 days was evaluated using the Kaplan Meier method with a log-rank test as well as unadjusted and multivariable Cox regression. The multivariable Cox regression model included variables associated with 30-day inhospital mortality using backward stepwise selection (retention P-value < 0.2). ",

Multiple logistic regression analyses showed after adjustment for potential confounders that hyponatremia remained associated with higher hsCRP (adjusted OR 4.70 [95%CI: 2.33-9.49], p < 0.01). In-hospital mortality was higher for hyponatremic patients in an unadjusted model (OR 1.90, 95%CI: 1.30-2.78). Hyponatremia persisted as an independent risk factor for increased in hospital mortality after adjustment for age, AKI, and several comorbidities (OR 1.80, 95% CI: 1.16-2.81). Crude 30-day survival was lower for patients with hyponatremia at admission compared with normonatremic patients (Figure 3) . Multivariable Cox regression survival analysis for in-hospital mortality adjusted for age, AKI, hypernatremia, and several comorbidities indicated a HR of 2.76 [95% CI:1.87-4.06] in hyponatremic patients (Figure 4; Table 4 ). In another model adjusted for hypertension and Charlson score, hyponatremia at the time of admission was associated with HR of 2.50 [95% CI: 1.72-3.65]) for in-hospital mortality (Figure 5; Table 4) . A sensitivity analysis of 84 patients who were admitted to the hospital for different pathologies and who got infected with COVID 19 showed the same development of hyponatremia and inflammation as patients admitted with COVID 19 alone ( Figure 6 ; Table 4 ). Thus, collectively, the present study suggests that mild hyponatremia at admission is associated with systemic inflammation and is an independent risk factor for hospital mortality. The prevalence of hyponatremia at admission in patients with COVID 19 has been variable in different retrospective or cross-sectional series ranging from 30% (12, 13) to 47.8% (14) . In our series, prevalence of hyponatremia was high (45.8%), probably because of the prospective nature of the study.",

However, in our population hyponatremia was present at admission before any therapeutic intervention took place. At admission no differences were found in vomiting, diarrhea, or fever between hyponatremic and nonhyponatremic patients ( Table 1) . Increased ADH release may be due non-osmotic ADH release associated with inflammation (9) . IL-6 has been demonstrated as stimulus for ADH secretion from magnocellular neurons present in the hypothalamus (9) . IL-6 is increased in COVID 19 infected patients with severe pneumonia and these higher IL-6 levels have been correlated with lower serum sodium levels in these patients (15) . Our data supports that hyponatremia at admission is due to nonosmotic release of ADH as our hyponatremic patients had higher hsCRP and serum ferritin levels than non-hyponatremic patients ( Table 2) . Moreover, in recent paper by Duan et al. (16) the two factors with the best distinguishing power of progression to severe cases in patients with COVID 19 at admission were serum sodium and C-reactive protein (CRP) (15) . Taken together these results suggest that inflammation is the main contributor to the hyponatremia seen at admission in our population.",

Hyponatremia was found to be an independent risk factor for death in SFTSV patients (22) . In the nonsurvivor group, hyponatremia occurred in 60% of the cases while in the survivor group it was present in 20% of them.

In sensitivity analysis performed on 84 patients that were admitted to the hospital for different pathologies and got infected with SARS-CoV-2 during hospital stay, the presence of hyponatremia was also associated with a higher rate of 30 day in-hospital mortality from all causes with a similar adjusted HR of 3.08 [95% CI: 1.35-6.99]). Thus, our prospective study confirms previous retrospective and cross-sectional studies that have shown a strong association of hyponatremia and mortality in COVID 19 infected patients. The present study although have limitations. As an observational study, this study is susceptible to residual confounding, as it relied on information from electronic medical record to identified potential confounders and did not included all possible characteristics such as the use of certain counter medications (NSAIDs, proton pump inhibitors), that may be associated with the development of hyponatremia but were not systemically available. In addition, results from the study sample may not be fully generalizable to all population, given the limited racial/ethnic diversities. Thus, future studies are needed in other populations to confirm our findings.",
