To accommodate differences between the general population considered by the SIRS model and the symptomatic subpopulation on which flu tests were performed, we introduced a scaling parameter that is estimated from the data using a penalized likelihood strategy. In this way, we obtained a full generative model for the data and were able to estimate all free parameters by maximum likelihood (ML), with the exception of a single tuning parameter, \u03bb, that controls the strength of the penalty for a truncated sampling probability. We find that the results of our analysis are qualitatively similar for a wide range of choices of \u03bb (Supplementary Materials).

The additional improvement in fit from local sunrise time, however, must represent a specific impact from this variable, because it is decoupled from day length only by the convention of seasonal daylight savings time. In other words, our model comparison is conservative in attributing as many seasonal effects as possible to day length, and then only attributing to sunrise specific effects that become apparent through the disruption of changing the clocks in the spring and fall. Interestingly, we find that the maximum-likelihood estimate (MLE) of the parameter describing the peak impact of sunrise time on R 0 (t) occurs between 6 and 7 am (0.5 < s 0 < 0.58; Supplementary Table S1), consistent with the typical morning rush hour in most US cities (see Discussion). Thus we find that local sunrise time is significantly associated with influenza even after accounting for other seasonal effects, and the nature of this association is consistent with an elevated infection rate when sunrise occurs around the time of the morning commute.

We found that eliminating seasonal clock changes, through either the permanent standard time or permanent DST policies, did indeed reduce the expected number of annual flu infections (Fig. 2B) . Interestingly, however, the permanent-DST strategy results in a clearer reduction in infections (6.0%\u00b11.7%) than the permanent-standard-time strategy (0.8%\u00b12.2%) ( Fig. 2B&C ; see Discussion). Here, we report model predictions and uncertainty as MLE \u00b1 SD, where SD is calculated by bootstrapping over states (see Discussion and Supplementary Materials). Owing to a variety of factors, this reduction varies considerably across states (Fig. 2C) , but the permanent DST policy always reduces infections, and always by more than permanent standard time.

However, we faced additional technical challenges in this case. First, the data on COVID-19 infections are less reliable than for influenza infections, because of the prevalence of asymptomatic cases, the limited testing capacity, and overlap in symptoms with flu and other respiratory diseases.

Interestingly, our models suggest-for both influenza and COVID-19-that the permanent-DST strategy is considerably more effective at reducing infections, overall, than the permanent-standard-time strategy. The reason for this difference is that permanent DST tends to lead to a substantially earlier and milder winter peak, whereas permanent standard time tends to delay the winter peak only slightly. These effects are particularly clear in the case of flu, where we have more data and closer-to-equilibrium conditions (Fig. 2A&B) . They can be understood by considering the timing and duration of the window of susceptibility during which the typical morning commute coincides with local sunrise time, and hence, increased susceptibility. Seasonal DST tends to artificially extend this window, even doubling it in some locations (Fig. 5) , thereby contributing to a pronounced increase in infections. Of the two strategies that do not involve changing the clocks, permanent standard time causes this window to occur substantially earlier in the fall, which has the effect of not only making infections peak earlier but also considerably reducing their number. In some states (such as GA; see A major challenge in this exercise is quantifying the uncertainty in these counterfactual predictions. We attempted to account for uncertainty by bootstrap-resampling at the level of the states (see Supplementary Materials and ref. 12 ). This bootstrapping approach accommodates various sources of error, including failures in numerical optimization or selection of suboptimal local maxima, and leads to substantial estimates in uncertainty, with the range of counterfactual predictions by our COVID-19 models often exceeding 10 percentage points (Fig. 3B,   Supplementary Fig. S6) . However, this approach still has the limitation that it only accounts for uncertainty in parameter values, and not for misspecification of the model itself-for example, owing to changes in hospitalization or death rates over time, evolving mitigation strategies, or the omission of critical covariates. For these reasons, it is likely that our error bars 13 .

For example, while our models were able to capture the spring and fall peaks in 2020 COVID-19 cases, they were not able to resolve the spring and summer waves in certain regions of the US, particularly in the south. This distinct summer peak may reflect evolving mitigation strategies during the first half of 2020, seasonal day-break hours for vulnerable groups such as agricultural workers, or other missing covariates in our model. In addition, the versions of the model we fitted to hospitalization and death data, while generally concordant, did not agree in all respects. For example, the estimated parameters differ somewhat between the two versions (Supplementary Tables S2 & S5) , possibly owing to deviations from our assumption of constant death and hospitalization rates. Similarly, we obtained somewhat different parameter estimates at the city and state levels. One recurring issue is that our estimation procedure inevitably sacrifices goodness of fit for cities or states with smaller numbers in order to accommodate ones with larger numbers, causing population centers to dominate the model fitting procedure. These limitations of our models attest to the substantial impact of lockdown and social distancing measures on the epidemiology of COVID-19, and therefore their indispensable role in combating pandemic respiratory viral diseases [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] . Nevertheless, despite these caveats, the models generally fit the data fairly well and were in reasonable agreement with one another and with other published observations (Supplementary Figs.

Our framework allows this question to be addressed by running our model forward under hypothetical alternative relationships between sunrise time and day length, consistent with various policies for clock time. We focused on three possible policies: (1) the one currently used in most US states (seasonal DST); (2) a policy where DST is completely eliminated (permanent standard time); and (3) a policy where DST is maintained throughout the year (permanent DST). We evaluated all three schemes using average values of the covariates over the past 10 years under the version of the model that allows for both day length and sunrise time to obtain an estimate of the expected effect of each 6 .",

S7-S9), given the complexities of modeling a newly emerging pandemic. Moreover, our relative model fits and parameter estimates were reasonably robust to different hospitalization and death rates (SupplementaryFig. S4, Supplementary Tables S3-S7).

Second, and more broadly, the model suggests a simple intervention to reduce the length and severity of \"winter\" epidemics: abandoning the practice of changing the clocks each spring and fall. As the post-pandemic trajectory of COVID-19 hinges on a complex interplay between immunity and seasonality 1,21-23 , a change in clock policy could serve as a relatively inexpensive mitigation strategy in conjunction with vaccination efforts and other interventions.We attempted to quantify the potential effect of this intervention by running our models forward under the alternative time policies. The predicted reductions in overall influenza cases under permanent DST were substantial, ranging from 4.3-7.7% (including estimated standard errors; see Supplementary Materials). Even more strikingly, we predicted an overall reduction in COVID-19 deaths of 14.8-27.0% and an overall reduction in hospitalizations of 14.5-26.9%.",

DST was re-adopted as a Federal standard in 1967, just in time for the H3N2 Hong Kong Flu (1968-70), and was expanded in 2007, just in time for H1N1 swine flu in 2009. DST was also observed in Hong Kong during the Asian (1957) and Hong Kong (1968) flu pandemics. But currently, Asian and African countries do not have DST, and have lower incidence and severity of COVID-19 than most countries in the Americas, Europe and the Middle East, where seasonal clock changes are widely observed (SupplementaryFig. S12). While there are many important exceptions, and many confounding factors, this worldwide trend supports our counterfactual modelling predictions that seasonal clock changes should be abandoned, a proposal already approved (though not yet implemented) in the European Union 29 . If zeitgeber zero hour-sunrise-does play a role in transmission and severity, these proposals to abandon seasonal clock changes are likely to reduce the impact of circadian immunity on ongoing and future seasonal epidemics.",
