When combining detection with nucleic acid detection, antibody detection can effectively compensate for nucleic acid detection. Virus infection always induce high antibody titer against SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein (N protein), which can be used to detect COVID-19 at both infected and convalescent patients. In this study we reported the expression and purification of N protein in E.coli from inclusion bodies by a combination of two cation exchange chromatography, and the yield of N protein was around 50 mg/L fermentation broth with more than 90% purity. A corresponding colloidal gold detection kit prepared with our purified N protein was used to verify the efficiency and accuracy our N protein in antibody detection method. Of the 58 COVID-19 PCR positive patients' inactivated serum samples, 40 samples were IgM positive (69.0%), and 42 samples were IgG positive (72.4%), and all 95 COVID-19 negative patients' inactivated serum samples were both IgM and IgG negative. Our results indicates that the refolded soluble N protein could be used for the preliminary detection of IgG and IgM antibodies against SARS-CoV-2.",

It is foreseeable that the epidemic will have a significant and far-reaching impact on human health management, social behavior and habits, and even international economic and trade relations. COVID-19 is a pneumonia caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV-2), which belongs to the \u03b2 -coronavirus of coronaviridae, a spherical, enveloped positive-strand RNA virus. The genome mainly encodes four structural proteins: spike protein, envelope protein, membrane protein, nucleocapsid protein (N protein). N protein is composed of 413 amino acid residues and binds to the viral genome RNA to form a nucleocapsid. N protein has strong immunogenicity and can induce a high antibody response in the serum of convalescent patients [1] [2] [3] .",

Studies have revealed that N protein is a compact, interwoven dimer, similar to SARS coronavirus and other related coronaviruses [4] . Bioinformatics analysis combined with the existing experimental spiritual evidence showed that SARS-CoV-2 N protein could form or regulate biomolecular aggregates in vivo by interacting with RNA and essential host cell proteins. The N protein of SARS-CoV-2 may use this activity to control the virus life cycle and host cell response to virus infections [5] . Static light scattering, size exclusion chromatography, and small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) showed that the purified N protein was mainly dimer in solution. Fluorescence polarization analysis showed that the purified N protein had a nonspecific nucleic acid binding ability. Western blotting confirmed IgA, IgM and IgG antibodies against N protein in the blood serum of COVID-19 patients, which proved the importance of this antigen in host immunity and diagnosis [6] .",

Researchers tested and compared samples with and without thermal inactivation. The results showed that anti SARS-CoV-2 N protein antibody was more sensitive than spike protein antibodies at early infection [7] . Rapid developments of immunoassays have been made to detect SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, including the neutralizing antibody assay, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), chemiluminescence immunoassay (CLIA) and lateral flow immunoassay (LFA). These detection methods have the potential to improve the diagnosis and control of different types of infection. These methods are based on detecting IgG and IgM antibodies against N protein and S protein in serum [8] [9] [10] . ELISA based on recombinant N protein was used to detect antibodies (IgM and/or IgG), the detection rates of positive samples were 68.2% and 70.1%, respectively. The positive rate of IgM and IgG increased as days exceeded but decreased after 35 days [11] . The Lanthanide-Doped Nanoparticles-Based Lateral Flow Immunoassay using N protein shown that N protein could be used for rapid and sensitive anti SARS-CoV-2 IgG detection [12] . With the continuous improvement of methodology, the serological method is used as an auxiliary tool for RT-PCR detection protocol [13] .",

We found that soluble N protein could be expressed under mild induction conditions, but the expression level was very low, this make a very big challenge for large scale production. Inclusion body expression harvested a large amount of N protein and was very conducive to further purification and application. Like most of nucleocapsid protein, SAR CoV-2 N protein has a high pI value (10.07), could bind with RNA and some host cell proteins which will copurify with N protein in the final products. These contaminations may eventually lead to false positive result when it was used for the immunoassay detection. The conventional affinity chromatography for N protein purification by nickel resin did not achieve the desired effect in our lab, so we designed a purification process based on the subtle differences between strong ion exchange chromatography and weak ion exchange chromatography. This combination purification procedures could get highly purified N protein and could get rid of most nucleic acid and host protein contaminations, and the process is simple, convenient and low cost, which is very conducive to the large-scale production and application of N protein. The colloidal gold immunoassay kit prepared with refolded soluble N protein could meet the needs of rapid and preliminary detection.
