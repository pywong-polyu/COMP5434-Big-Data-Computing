Methods This retrospective, single-center cohort study included 562 consecutive patients who underwent cardiac surgery in a tertiary hospital from January 2015 to December 2016. We assessed VS occurrence and its relationship with HD duration and other risk factors. To assess the effect of the HD duration on VS occurrence, we constructed ordinal variables: HD = 0 (non-HD), 0 < HD \u2264 5 (HD \u2264 5 years), 5 < HD \u2264 10, and 10 < HD.",

Cardiac surgeries included all coronary artery bypass graft procedures, all valvular procedures, and aortic surgery involving cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). Sixty-six patients (10%) developed VS. Most preoperative patient characteristics were comparable between the VS and no-VS groups; a chronic HD status and a total CPB time of > 180 min were significantly more common in the VS group (P < 0.0001 and P = 0.02, respectively). Longer term HD significantly correlated with VS incidence (P < 0.0001). Ordinal variables for the HD duration and age and known risk factors for VS (preoperative use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and beta-blockers, low left-ventricular ejection fraction, and CPB time > 180 min) were subjected to multivariate regression analysis. Long-term HD was identified as an independent predictor of VS (odds ratio, 2.29, 95% confidence interval, 1.66-3.18). Conclusions Longer term HD may be associated with a higher VS incidence after cardiac surgery. VS should be given attention after cardiac surgery in chronic HD-dependent patients.",

Although there is an overall agreement regarding the effect of specific risk factors for VS, other factors are more controversial. In recent literature, chronic hemodialysis (HD)-dependent renal failure has been suggested to be a risk factor for VS because of its chronic inflammatory status [10, 11] . Repeated dialysis treatments in patients with chronic renal failure (CRF) are considered to promote an inflammatory response [12] , although the duration of HD has not yet been examined in detail. We hypothesized that a longer period of dialysis results in an increased frequency of VS. Thus, our study aimed to evaluate whether longer term hemodialysis (HD) is associated with a higher incidence of VS after cardiac surgery.",

[11] demonstrated that CABG procedures with CPB in patients with CRF requiring dialysis therapy were an independent risk factor for the development of postoperative VS. However, accurate assessment of chronic HD as an independent risk factor for VS was difficult because of the small number of patients with chronic HD. In the present study, we demonstrated this by directly comparing chronic HD-dependent patients with non-dependent patients and adjusting the results for confounding factors in a multivariate regression analysis. We then examined the association between HD duration and the incidence of VS and found that a longer period of dialysis resulted in more frequent occurrences of VS, with a statistically significant difference.

The pathophysiological mechanisms underlying VS remain controversial; however, there is a clear association between the expression of proinflammatory mediators and subsequent induction of nitric oxide production and cyclic guanosine monophosphatemediated severe vasodilation [2, 15, 16] . Moreover, chronic inflammation is prevalent in patients with CRF [17] , and repeated dialysis treatments in such patients lead to leucocyte activation and consequently, cytokine production [12] . We expected that longer term HD-dependent CRF would Fig. 1 Association between the hemodialysis duration and incidence of vasoplegic syndrome after cardiac surgery increase the risk of post-cardiac surgery VS. Moreover, we showed that chronic HD dependence is a risk factor for VS, and that VS develops more frequently in patients who require longer term HD. It is reasonable to surmise that the intrinsic chronic inflammatory status in patients with HDdependent CRF promotes an inflammatory response leading to VS, and that longer term HD develops a strong tendency for this response. Our findings can be utilized in clinical practice. When patients with chronic HD dependence, particularly longterm HD, exhibit distributive shock in postoperative care, VS should be considered as a differential diagnosis. It is very important to distinguish VS from other possible diagnoses, such as septic shock and anaphylactic shock, because this may change the treatment plans. The use of vasopressin did not produce a statistically significant improvement in the mortality rate of patients in a meta-analysis [18] . However, Hajjar et al. [14] found that vasopressin can be used as a first-line vasopressor for post-cardiac surgery VS and improves patient clinical outcomes. In the future, the threshold for vasopressin initiation for the treatment of distributive shock after cardiac surgery may change.",

            "text": "Our study had several limitations. First, because of the retrospective design, confounding factors may have affected our results. The influence of unknown risk factors cannot be ruled out. We included major known risk factors in the multivariate analysis to eliminate the influence of more confounding factors, but this might not have been sufficient. Second, we devised the diagnostic criteria for VS based on previous reports, because there are no clear or standardized criteria. The appropriate timing for evaluation also remains unclear. We determined the timing for evaluation as 0, 2, 4, 8, and 16 h after transfer to ICU in accordance with a previous representative report that specified these timings [5] , but these different intervals may have affected VS diagnosis. The purpose of evaluation at two consecutive time points was to increase the specificity of the diagnostic criteria for VS. The early postoperative period is especially important for diagnosis because VS is characterized by occurring early after surgery; therefore, we consider our criteria to be clinically appropriate. Third, severity of VS in this study may have been relatively mild compared to previous reports. There were very few patients categorized as having severe VS, and the overall mortality rate was relatively low compared with previous reports [7, 10] . However, it cannot be said sweepingly, because there is no definitive severity classification of VS and there are very little data about VS mortality. Further studies are needed to clarify severity and prognosis of VS. Fourth, our study only assessed chronic HD dependence or non-dependence; thus, we did not assess the direct relationship between CRF and VS. It is unclear whether the main predictor of VS is HD or CRF, and whether mild CRF is a risk factor for VS. Further research is needed to assess the relationship between CRF, renal function, disease duration, and post-cardiac surgery VS.",
