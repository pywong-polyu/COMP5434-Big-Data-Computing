[35] performs an exhaustive analysis of the international organizations involved in Smart City standardisation. It presents a complete study about Smart City vendors and their software systems. It starts by exposing the two barriers to Smart City solutions. First, the current Smart City technologies are based on non-interoperable custom systems that are not replicable in other cities. Second, the architectural design efforts have not yet converged to a clear reference, creating uncertainly among stakeholders. It compares 47 different Smart City software systems based in their domain work, communication protocols, training and promotion resources, location of deployments and open software design and architecture. It emphasizes the importance of the methodology to choose a Smart City software architecture system.

Ref. [35] shows that the FIWARE Platform covers all the main domains expected in Smart City solutions. FIWARE is an open system that offers a public API and is compatible with main communication protocols which has been successfully deployed, for example in some cities in Spain and Argentina. In addition, it is used in some research projects.

It indicates that the use of FIWARE as a core element can rely on a basic configuration for low load levels, but in the case of high load levels deploying an appropriate shared cluster to be used as global data storage facility is recommended. That work used the official FIWARE agents to access to the data from heterogeneous data sources. In addition, it is worth explaining that the implementation of IoT agents and connectors between data sources and middleware layer need to be improved to support the load of current and future large-scale scenarios for IoT.

According to the previous, all NGSI agents needed to be developed in one experiment must follow the three-step processing. Within the syntactic and semantic transformation, several other computations such as filtering, grouping, cleaning, discarding may take place. Additionally, all interoperability agents have certain inseparable parameters, which are the refresh time (RT) and the \"kpiName\" field name. In the experiment of this paper, a total of seven agents were developed to ensure proper storage and usage of historic and real-time data. In Table 4 details are found of their development.

This drove the design to couple the traffic on one side (gates of the port and city), vessel information on other side and weather information on a third and final string. The leaf nodes (KPIs) were also individually separated by isolated pieces of information (Gate 16 of the port, Gate 10A of the port, vessel count, temperature, wind speed and precipitation intensity). This led to a three-levels composition, being the KPIs the leaf nodes, three subindices and the TCI as the root node, resulting in a 7:3:1 matrix. \u2022 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of available historical data: Authors carried out a thorough EDA of the historic of data (see Section 3.3). A summary of that EDA is attached in Appendix B. The main aim of this EDA was to discover how the data performs through time, noticing seasonality, and, mainly, to find the correlation between the different data with the main reference source: the traffic at the gates of the port. The results of this correlation were the following: \u2022 Weighting: The last-but-one configuration for the CI was to select the weighting method and values to give to each node. This is a crucial action that has been widely studied in the composition of CIs [108] . There is not a universal weighting method and it must be analysed case by case, introducing a challenging choice [109] . The most used method is equal weighting, followed by analytical methods (regression analysis, benefit-of-doubt, principal component analysis), with opinion-based methods only used marginally. The choice depends on the nature of data and indicator items: (i) equal weighting tends to be used when no historical data is known, (ii) analytical methods are case-to-case analysed depending on the items and (iii) opinion-based methods are mostly used in social sciences (cases where the target indicator is highly subjective). In this experiment, the authors opted for an analytical method driven by the analysis of historic data available. The specific scheme selected was to base the weighting values on the correlation of all items with the main reference item. For establishing those values, g the authors came to map KPI-weight, sub-index-weight, which brought to solve three equations systems (see numbers and structure of the points above).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 188, "end": 192, "text": "[99]", "ref_id": "BIBREF105"}, {"start": 1394, "end": 1399, "text": "[108]", "ref_id": "BIBREF114"}, {"start": 1515, "end": 1520, "text": "[109]", "ref_id": "BIBREF115"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "\u2022"}, {"text": "Wi \u00d7 Corri \u2212 other_sources_in_string = 1 (1)", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "\u2022"}, {"text": "The relation among KPIs is known by Table 5 , therefore the Gauss method was used to solve them and come up with the weights, which are displayed in Figure 13 .", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 36, "end": 43, "text": "Table 5", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 149, "end": 158, "text": "Figure 13", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}], "section": "\u2022"}, {"text": "Aggregation method: According to the literature, there are three widely used aggregation methods [108] : additive aggregation, geometric aggregation and non-compensatory aggregation, being the first one the most popular by far.

Non-compensatory methods are the most computationally expensive of the three. For this experiment, the authors considered that the relevance of all indicators was not equal, being the traffic at the gates the reference item. Noticing the previous, the choice was to select additive aggregation. However, the framework developed in this paper has been designed to allow the selection of any of them for future uses. \u2022 Normalization method: The items to build the indicator must be comprehended in the same scale in order to be aggregated. Thus, a normalization step was included in this computation. A lot of methods for normalization are available, and to be able to finally select one as definitive several robustness test must be done. The objective of the work in this paper was to demonstrate the use of these calculations using a specific IoT architecture rather than going deep into normalisation arguments.

Last but not least, visibility and acceptance from the community. From the municipality perspective, the TCI can be useful for another set of targets. Understanding the main contributor to the traffic congestion may help the administration to apply tailored control, influencing demographics, urban development, taxes or fines. Public bodies may also benefit from experiments like the TCI as a tool for auditing performance and ensuring to keep traffic levels among reasonable thresholds. Additionally, the semaphores and other signaling rhythms adjusting systems would have another input to be fed from.
