The Department of Neurology at the Santa Maria University Hospital in Terni, in which we work, serves as a comprehensive stroke center for southern Umbria. We collected data on the neurological consultations and admissions from the Emergency Department between 08:00 AM on 26th March and 02:00 PM on 27th March 2020, and we compared these results with similar periods (2 working days) in November 2018 and 2019, to determine whether there was any reduction in acute neurological events (Table 1) . Furthermore, of the 44 patients admitted to the neurology ward during the first month of lockdown, 11 underwent acute stroke treatment (4 intravenous thrombolysis, 1 mechanical thrombectomy and 6 both treatments). These data are similar to those from the previous 2 years.",

Furthermore, despite the fall in the overall number of hospital admissions (16.7% vs 22.3% in 2018 and 30.5% in 2019), admissions to the neurology ward increased if compared with the previous 2 years (50% vs. 7.7% in 2018 and 9.5% in 2019). These outcomes may be explained by a drop in the number of requests for neurological consultations in general whereas the number of admissions to the neurology ward confirms that serious neurological events requiring hospitalization did not decrease in the period considered, which is in line with the expected number of acute treatments performed for ischemic stroke.",

A possible explanation for the discrepancy between our data and those reported by other Italian centers may be the significantly lower prevalence of COVID-19 infection in our region than in other regions, particularly those in northern Italy. The prevalence of COVID-19-positive subjects in the resident population has varied considerably in Italy, with figures ranging from 860 per 100,000 in Valle d'Aosta to 50 per 100,000 in Calabria (150 per 100,000 in Umbria) (see https ://www.gimbe .org/downl oad/ CS_GIMBE _COVID -19_mappa _risch io_regio ni%20(figur e).pdf). This variability has also been reflected by the temporary relocation/dismissal of neurological units, including stroke units, in some of the regions affected most (to increase the number of beds available for COVID-19 patients).",

It thus becomes even more important to increase awareness among health professionals and the members of the public, especially those who are at high risk, of how to recognize a stroke and help launch the network to avoid significant delays in management [5] . Stroke networks should, if necessary, be adjusted to minimize the risk of infection for health professionals and patients when suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients with stroke are treated. Since COVID-19 patients are affected by enhanced coagulopathy, which is accompanied by a higher risk of arterial and venous thromboembolism that may affect multiple sites (heart, brain, kidney, lung), we expect to observe an increased number of COVID-19-specific or COVID-19-mediated strokes in the coming months. We should, therefore, be prepared to deal with the consequences of any COVID-19 outbreak on neurological care that may result from the increased prevalence of patients with this virus according to specific protocols and the best scientific evidence.",
