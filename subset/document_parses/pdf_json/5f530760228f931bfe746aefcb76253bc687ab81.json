The patient developed severe symptomatic COVID-19 despite her third (booster) vaccination. She did not * Corresponding author. complained of increased cognitive deficit for which she will receive a cognitive evaluation. This case illustrates that at least a proportion of MS patients on anti-CD20 therapies may not generate a humoral response, even after three vaccinations and/or a concomitant COVID-19 infection. This raises the question if and to which degree booster vaccinations can succeed in improving humoral responses in MS patients on anti-CD20 therapies. Even though T cell immunity can be demonstrated in most anti-CD20 therapies treated patients, ( Tortorella et al., 2021 ; Apostolidis et al., 2021 ) impaired humoral immunity may still lead to increased susceptibility for and severity of COVID-19, although prospective clinical data after a third vaccination is lacking. This case indicates that high clinical vigilance for (breakthrough) infections is needed in these patients, regardless of vaccinations and previous infections, as early treatments for COVID-19 preventing severe infection have become available.

In 2021 the patient received ocrelizumab infusions in March and September, she was vaccinated with Spikevax (Moderna) in April and May 2021 and received the booster vaccination in October. One to two weeks prior to the ocrelizumab infusions in March and September the patient was B-cell depleted (1 CD19 B-cell/\u03bcL in March and 0 CD19 B-cell/\u03bcL in August). At time of the third booster vaccination in October the CD19 B-cells were 1 cell/\u03bcL. Eleven days after the booster vaccination the patient was tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by PCR. She experienced symptoms of dyspnea and fever and was admitted to the hospital for eleven days where she was treated with oxygen and dexamethasone. As a participant in a prospective multicenter cohort study on SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in patients with various immune mediated diseases (T2B!; Trial NL8900; Dutch Trial register), SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were measured 28 days after each vaccination and after her COVID-19 infection.( Steenhuis et al., 2021 ) Our patient failed to mount any humoral response after first, second or third vaccination and even after suffering from severe COVID-19. At time of last serology, 28 days after third vaccination and 17 days after positive SARS-CoV PCR, the patient remained negative for anti-RBD as well as anti-nucleocapsid protein antibodies. The patient fully recovered from COVID-19, however two months after the breakthrough infection(December 2021) she still https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nerep.2022.100072 Received 16 December 2021; Received in revised form 11 January 2022; Accepted 29 January 2022 2667-257X/\u00a9 2022 The Authors.
