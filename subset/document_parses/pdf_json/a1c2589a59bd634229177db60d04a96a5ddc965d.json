(1) It is a quantitative science concerned in infectious diseases with the circumstances under which disease processes occur, the factors that affect their incidence and the host response to the infectious agent, and the use of this knowledge for control and prevention. (2) It includes the pathogenesis of disease in both the community and the individual. For infectious diseases, one must study the circumstances under which both infection and disease occur, for these may be different. Infection is the consequence of an encounter of a potentially pathogenic microorganism with a susceptible human host through an appropriate portal of entry and usually involves a demonstrable host response to the agent. Exposure is the key factor, and the sources of infection lie mostly outside the individual human host, within the environment, or in other infected hosts. Disease represents one of the possible consequences of infection, and the factors important in its development are mostly intrinsic to the host, although the dosage and virulence of the infecting microbe play a role. These intrinsic factors include the age at the time of infection, the portal of entry, the presence or absence of immunity, the vigor of the primary defense system, the efficiency and nature of humoral and cell-mediated immune responses, the genetic makeup of the host, the state of nutrition, the presence of other diseases, and psychosocial influences. These factors that result in the occurrence of clinical illness among those infected have been called the \"clinical illness-promotion factors,\" (3) and many of them remain unknown. The host responses can include death, the classic clinical features of the disease, mild or atypical forms, subclinical and inapparent infections, and the carrier state, which may exist in the absence of a detectable host response. While the clinician is primarily concerned with disease, the epidemiologist is interested in both infection and disease. Infection without disease is a common phenomenon, so that a study limited to clinical illness alone would give an incomplete epidemiological picture and would be a poor basis for control and prevention.

Some of the differences between viral and bacterial infection include the intracellular position of all viruses, their smaller size, the requirement of living tissues for viral multiplication, the ease with which many viruses are spread by respiratory routes or by insect vectors, the relatively high order of immunity following viral infection, the usefulness of serological tests for the diagnosis of most viral infections, and the failure of viral infections to respond to antibiotic therapy. Highly sensitive and specific molecular methods are being increasingly employed to define the agent and the host response to it. (6) (7) (8) Many concepts and methods of epidemiology apply to both infectious and noninfectious diseases, and there should be no essential dichotomy between the two. (9) In general, epidemiology can be regarded as the development, pathogenesis, and expression of infection and disease in a community in much the same way as clinical medicine is concerned with the development, pathogenesis, and expression in the individual.

Epidemiological studies may be descriptive or analytical. Descriptive studies are based on available data sources and describe the patterns of disease in population groups according to time, place, and person factors. Epidemic investigations begin with a descriptive study. These data often suggest clues to the etiology of the condition or to the risk factors involved.

Cohort Study. This is the most definitive and expensive type of study and is based on identifying a group or groups of persons (cohorts) who are followed over time for the development of disease (or infection) in the presence or absence of suspected risk factors that are measured at the start of the study. These studies are usually carried out by identifying a cohort or usually two or more cohorts at the present time and then following them longitudinally over time. One cohort will be the group exposed to a risk factor or there may be several cohorts, each with a different degree of exposure. There usually is another cohort of unexposed persons who are followed in the same way. The cohorts are followed until the effect of the exposure occurs or the study is terminated for other reasons. If the occurrence of disease is the expected outcome, persons immune to the disease at the beginning of the study would not be included in a study cohort. This has been called a prospective cohort study or simply a prospective study. In infectious disease epidemiology, it may be possible to identify the persons in the cohort who are susceptible or immune at the start of the study by measuring the presence or absence of antibody in the initial serum specimens. Serial serum samples are then taken in which the appearance of antibody indicates the approximate time at which infection occurs. The occurrence of clinical disease at the same time provides information of the clinicalsubclinical ratio. If the appropriate serum samples are taken and frozen, the actual testing can be delayed to the end of the study.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Methods"}, {"text": "An alternative method of conducting a cohort study is to identify a group of persons at some time in the past who were presumably free of the disease under investigation at that time, as indicated by examining existing records.

This can be calculated using the format of a fourfold matrix as depicted in Table 1 .

When a significant difference in the prevalence of a characteristic or risk factor is found, then the possibility of a causal association is suspected. Further studies using the cohort method are then often carried out to add strength to the association. The case-control study is usually the first type made because it is based on existing data, can be completed in a relatively short time, and is the least expensive. However, it cannot define the true incidence of the disease in relation to the various factors because the denominator at risk is not known.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 235, "end": 242, "text": "Table 1", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}], "section": "Methods"}, {"text": "A variation of the case-control study, and one encompassing the concept of a cohort study, is termed the nested case-control study.

Various attributes of the two groups defined at the start of the study can then be compared. This method is very useful for diseases or conditions of low frequency in which analysis of the entire cohort would be an overwhelming task. An example of this is a recent study of Hodgkin's disease in relation to elevated levels of antibody to Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). (23) In this analysis, 240,000 persons whose sera had been collected and stored in four serum banks were followed for 5 years through cancer registries or hospital records for the development of Hodgkin's disease. Fortythree cases were identified in this manner and the EBV and other antibody levels were determined in sera from the group and compared with results from matched controls bled at the same time.

Ideally, this would assume that all patients with the disease seek medical attention, that the correct diagnosis is made and substantiated, that all medical facilities are canvassed, and that all cases are detected. In practice, these criteria are seldom met, and patients, for example, from a single hospital may be the only ones studied. This introduces a bias, since certain patients may be excluded from a given hospital because of such factors as age (e.g., no pediatric wards), socioeconomic level, or military or civilian status; the patient or physician may select a given hospital because of nearness, religious affiliation, the physician's privileges, nature of payment, or other considerations.

Five circumstances in which epidemics occur can be mentioned: first, when a new group of susceptibles is introduced into a setting where a disease is endemic; second, when a new source of infection is introduced into an area from which the microbial agent has been absent and many susceptibles are therefore present, as in the return of visitors from a foreign country, or the arrival of new immigrants, or the contamination of food, water, or other sources of exposure by an agent not normally present; third, when effective contact is made between a preexisting infection of low endemicity with susceptible persons as a result of changes in social, behavioral, sexual, or cultural practices. Crowding as in a prison camp or institution or exposure of a new portal of entry are examples. A fourth possibility is an increased susceptibility to infection or disease or both through immunosuppression or other factors that influence the host response, such as a preceding viral infection, nutritional disorder, treatment with immunosuppressive drugs, or presence of a chronic disease. The devastating effect of HIV on the immune system has resulted in a worldwide epidemic of enormous and increasing proportions. A fifth circumstance might be the increase in the virulence or dosage of a microbial agent. This may have accounted for the massive outbreak of waterborne Cryptosporidium infection that occurred in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in March-April 1993, which involved 404,000 infected persons of whom 4,400 required hospitalization. (28) Epidemics or outbreaks are often classified from the standpoint of the source of infection. A common-source or common-vehicle outbreak may result from exposure of a group of persons to a single source of infection. This could be an exposure to a common source occurring at a single point in time, as in most foodborne outbreaks (point epidemics), and characterized by a sharply defined and limited epidemic curve, often within the incubation period of the disease. It could be exposure on a continued or extended basis, as would be the case from a contaminated water supply or air source (airborne) and would result in an extended epidemic curve. In the latter setting, variations in the epidemic curve could result from differences in the dosage and time of occurrence of the microbial contaminant in the common vehicle or in the amount consumed, or they could result from changes in the frequency of exposure of the persons at risk to infection. The secondary spread of certain infectious agents from human to human in a common-source outbreak will also alter the epidemic curve, often producing a group of scattered cases after the initial epidemic wave subsides; these are called secondary cases and can lead to tertiary cases.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1930, "end": 1934, "text": "(28)", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Pathogenesis of an Outbreak"}, {"text": "A second type of epidemic spread called propagated or progressive is due to multiplication and spread of an agent from one host to another. This is also called contact spread and may be direct, indirect, or by droplets (see Section 7). This is most often human-to-human spread, but could involve animal or arthropod intermediates. Here, the epidemic curve depends on the number of susceptibles, the degree of contact with an infected host, the incubation period of the disease, the mechanism of transmission, the portal of entry, and the infectiousness of the causative agent. In either common-source or propagated outbreaks, the epidemic decreases or stops when (1) the number of susceptibles effectively exposed to the source is diminished by natural attrition, by immunization, by antibiotic prophylactics, or by actual development of the disease itself; (2) the source of infection is eliminated; or (3) the means of transmission is interrupted.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Pathogenesis of an Outbreak"}, {"text": "The general strategy in the investigation of an outbreak includes establishing whether an epidemic actually exists, determining its extent, identifying the circumstances under which it occurred (e.g., time, place, person), evaluating its probable mode of spread, and initiating the steps to be taken for its control.

One is the infectiousness, expressed as the ratio: number infected/number susceptible and exposed. A second is pathogenicity, a term used to denote the potential for an infectious organism to induce disease. It can be expressed quantitatively as follows: number with disease/number infected. The determinants of pathogenicity include mobile genetic elements such as plasmids, bacteriophages, and transposons. (33) The pathogenic process is complex and represents sequence of events in which many components are involved. (34) The adherence of organisms to host surfaces is a highly specific and essential step for subsequent events to develop. Epithelial surfaces provide appropriate sites for many bacteria. M. pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae find attachment sites in the respiratory epithelium, Neisseria gonorrhea in the urethral epithelium, and many enteric organisms (V. cholerae, E. coli, Salmonella typhosa, Shigella flexneri) in intestinal or colonic epithelium. Pathogenic organisms must possess characteristics that protect them against such host defenses as mucus and phagocytic cells. These protective features of the bacteria themselves include polysaccharide capsules (pneumococci, Klebsiella, Haemophilus), hyaluronic acid capsules and M proteins (\u03b2-hemolytic streptococci), and a surface polypeptide (B. anthracis). Toxins and certain extracellular enzymes may be important in the establishment of infection and in spread through tissues. The latter include collagenase (C. perfringens), coagulase (staphylococci), hyaluronidases (staphylococci, streptococci, clostridia, pneumococci), strepto-kinase or fibrinolysin (hemolytic streptococci), hemolysins and leukocydins (streptococci, staphylococci, clostridia, gram-negative rods), and proteases (Neisseria, streptococci) that can hydrolyze immunoglobulins, such as secretory IgA.

Molecular studies of the determinants of virulence include how agents enter epithelial cells, a property that may be carried in different ways. In enteroenvasive E. coli it may be on a large plasmid, whereas for Yersinia pseudotuberculosis it is by a small DNA segment of the bacterial chromosome. (35) This property may be exchanged between bacteria, making noninvasive bacteria invasive. Some organisms may lose apparent virulence if their structural identity is too close to the host's carbohydrates (for which the term camouflage strategy has been suggested).

The exotoxins liberated by many gram-positive bacteria cause local cell and tissue injury; some damage phagocytic cells and thereby facilitate the spread of the organism. Examples include Clostridium welchii, Clostridium botulinum, C. tetanus, Corynebacterium diphtheriae, S. dysenteriae, V. cholerae, B. anthracis, Bordetella pertussis, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Staphylococcus aureus. (36) Some exotoxins are directly responsible for the characteristic clinical features of the disease, some are antiphagocytic, and some promote spread in tissues. They cause little or no fever in the host. Endotoxins are an integral part of the cell wall of gram-negative organisms. They are liberated in soluble form both during bacterial growth and presumably during death and disintegration of the organism. Endotoxins are strong immunologic adjuvants. They may produce fever in man and many other vertebrates; the pyrogenic action is mediated by a product synthesized by monocytes (\"endogenous pyrogen\") that acts on the thermoregulatory center in the hypothalamus. Other endogenous agents, such as prostaglandins and catecholamines, may also play a role. The lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is the most important component of endotoxin and is composed of a core polysaccharide common to many gram-negative bacteria, an O-specific polysaccharide conferring virulence and serological specificity, and a lipid A portion, mainly responsible for toxicity. (35) The effects of endotoxins appear to be mediated through leukotrienes, prostaglandins, and cachectin/TNF. Cachectin, which is identical to tumor necrosis factor, (37) is indistinguishable functionally from lymphotoxin, a product of activated T cells. This protein is produced by macrophages and by T cells in response to bacteria, viruses, and parasites and also occurs during cancers, resulting, in order of increasing dosage, in the following sequence of events: inflammation, cytotoxicity, cachexia, organ failure, irreversible shock, and death. There is a synergism between it and interleukin-1 in this phenomenon. Monoclonal antibody to cachectin/TNF can inhibit these responses and glucosteroids can also prevent endotoxin deaths. The gene for cachectin has been identified, and when put into hamster ovarian cells and then into nude mice results in cachexia. Despite these deleterious effects, cachectin/TNF in small doses appears to be beneficial in serving as a growth factor for macrophages and as a tissue remodeler, a role for which it may have been designed in nature. It is not clear whether all these effects are mediated directly by cachectin/TNF or through mediators released by them. With large doses of endotoxins, there is also an effect that produces vascular collapse and death. Unlike exotoxins, endotoxins are heat-stable and are not fully convertible to protective toxoids. Endotoxins are normally released by many gram-negative bacteria in the intestines of healthy individuals, presumably absorbed in small amounts, and degraded by the Kuppfer cells. This occurs without pathological consequences on a continual basis and has a beneficial effect in stimulating the development of the immune system in the immature individual. (33) Exotoxins are excreted by living cells, are quite unstable to heat, and consist of polypeptides of molecular weights from 10,000 to 900,000. They are highly antigenic and result in high titers of antitoxin that can neutralize the toxin. This antigenic property is useful in immunization with toxins rendered nontoxic by formalin, heat, and other methods. Different toxins produce disease via different mechanisms. (31) C. diphtheriae toxin results in inhibition of protein synthesis and necrosis of epithelium, heart muscle, kidney, and nerve tissues. The toxin of C. tetani reaches the central nervous system by retrograde axon transport where it increases reflex excitation in neurons of the spinal cord by blocking an inhibitor mediator. C. botulinum exerts its effect on the nervous system by blocking the release of acetylcholine at synapses and neuromuscular junction. Gut organisms, such as Clostridium difficile, produce a necrotizing toxin that leads to antibiotic-associated colitis, and that of S. aureus stimulates neural receptors from which impulses are transmitted to medullary centers controlling gut motility. V. cholerae toxin binds to ganglioside receptors on the villi of the small intestine, leading to a large increase in adenylate cyclase and AMP concentrations and the resulting massive hypersecretion of chloride and water and the impairment of absorption of sodium that characterizes the severe diarrhea and acidosis of cholera. Other toxins, such as that of hemolytic lysogenic streptococci, result in the punctate maculopapular rash of scarlet fever.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 531, "end": 535, "text": "(36)", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 1580, "end": 1584, "text": "(35)", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 1746, "end": 1750, "text": "(37)", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 3337, "end": 3341, "text": "(33)", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 3756, "end": 3760, "text": "(31)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Characteristics of Organisms That are Involved in Production of Disease"}, {"text": "The production of clinical disease through immunopathologic mechanisms is more important for viral than for bacterial infections, but there are some examples of the latter. In streptococcal infections, antibodies may develop against an unknown component of the organism that is antigenically similar to heart muscle, leading to myocarditis. Immune complexes may also form, deposit in the kidney, and result in glomerulonephritis. In infections due to M. pneumoniae, the production of \"heterophile\" antibodies against human O erythrocytes (cold agglutinins) occasionally leads to acute hemolytic anemia. In primary infections by M. tuberculosis, the pathological picture is dominated by a vigorous and persistent cell-mediated immune response to the invading organism.

The effects of the environment on the organism itself are discussed in Section 4.1. The environment also contains the physical and biological mechanisms required for spread. The former includes air, water, and food and the latter animal, bird, and insect vectors. For some bacterial infections, the primary host is not man but some other living creature in the environment. This includes anthrax, brucellosis, leptospirosis, Lyme disease, Q fever, bubonic plague, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, salmonellosis, and tularemia. For infections involving insect transmission such as louse-borne typhus, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, and bubonic plague, the humidity, temperature, vegetation, and other factors in the environment may play a central role in limiting the occurrence of the infection to well-defined geographic areas favorable to the vector. Through climatic factors, the environment exerts an influence on exposure of the host to microorganisms. Warm weather and tropical climates result in recreational and occupational exposures to water, sewage, swimming pools, wild animals, and insects; they promote spread of skin infections in unclothed persons with abrasions on their skin. Certain organisms grow or survive better in warmer environments, especially enteric organisms. Intestinal infections flourish under such conditions. Inadequate refrigeration leads to foodborne outbreaks. Epidemics of Legionnaires' disease appear to depend on a chain of warm weather events. These include appropriate temperature and humidity for the organism to grow in soil or water, the contamination of a water-cooling tower or air conditioner, and airborne carriage or propulsion of the organism to susceptible humans, frequently in an enclosed environment (e.g., hotel, hospital, institution, club); July and August are good months for this.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Environment"}, {"text": "The colder winter months, as well as school seasons in temperate climates of the northern hemisphere, bring individuals into close contact in a closed environment, facilitating spread of infections by the respiratory route.

The peak period of different disease varies from one season to another. For example, pertussis and M. pneumoniae infections tend to occur most commonly in the fall and streptococcal infections in the spring. In addition, longer-term temporal trends in infection and disease occur within the same environment (as discussed in Chapter 2, Section 8.2). These changes reflect the complex interplay of agent, host, and environment.

Antibiotic-resistant organisms are frequent in this setting. In prisons and in institutions for the mentally retarded or ill, low levels of personal hygiene and crowding contribute to the spread of respiratory, intestinal, and skin infections. Exposure in meatpacking and slaughterhouses or tanneries, or travel to developing countries, involves the risk of infection by various bacterial agents within that environment. With regard to children, the day-care center is posing an increasing hazard for them, as well as their parents for certain infectious diseases, especially respiratory and intestinal infections.

(41) Thus, rifampin prophylaxis of contacts may be unnecessary in these settings, although some other investigators disagree with this. For HIV infection, the environments of the brothel, the bar, and the bathhouse have provided ready transmission of this and other sexually transmitted infections, as has the \"shooting gallery\" of intravenous drug abusers.

Typhoid fever is transmitted by food or water contaminated by the feces or urine from a patient or carrier and sometimes through contaminated shellfish or canned goods.

Tissue damage results from the direct action of the bacteria, microbial toxins, indirect injury, inflammation, or immunopathologic processes. Most bacteria have specific attachment sites on epithelial surfaces (see Section 4.2). Examples of localized infections include diphtheria and streptococcal infections of the throat, gonococcal infections of the conjunctiva or urethra, cholera, and most Salmonella infections of the intestine. Many gram-negative bacteria have a limited capacity to invade tissues and tend to remain localized; some are able to invade only in debilitated, malnourished, or immunocompromised patients. Host antibacterial forces limit the spread of many bacteria. At the subepithelial level, three important defense mechanisms are called into play: (1) tissue fluids, (2) the lymphatic system leading to the lymph nodes, and (3) phagocytic cells (macrophages) in tissues and polymorphonuclear cells in the blood. Each of these mechanisms depends on the inflammatory response for its action, (35) as manifested by four cardinal signs: warmth and redness due to vasodilatation, swelling (vasodilatation and exudate), and pain (tissue distention, pain mediators). Polymorphonuclear cells enter, as well as macrophages and lymphocytes; exudation occurs. Tissue fluids provide plasma proteins, including immunoglobulins, such as IgG, complement, and properdin. The primary mediators of inflammation include histamine, 5-hydroxytryptamine, and kinins. Prostaglandins E and F are thought to play a role in the termination of the response. Microorganisms in peripheral lymphatics are rapidly carried to lymph nodes, where they are exposed to macrophages lining the sinus that act as a bacterial filter. Here, too, polymorphs, serum factors accumulating during inflammation, and the initiation of the immune response limit the infection. The phagocytic cells play a key role in the interaction with microorganisms, ingesting and killing bacterial invaders. Among the chemotractant factors for phagocytosis are platelet-activating factors, leukotriene B4, C5a, and certain formyl peptides. (33) The details are fully described by Mims, (32, 36) as are the ways in which some bacteria are able to resist or interfere with phagocytic activity.

Bacteria may exist free in the plasma (pneumococci, B. anthracis, Leptospira), intracellularly in monocytes (Listeria, tubercle and leprosy bacilli, Brucella), or in association with polymorphonuclear cells (many pyogenic bacteria). The bacteremia may be transient and with little or no systemic response, as follows dental extraction in a healthy person; even a continuous bacteremia may exist with few toxic signs, as in leprosy where the organism exists in large numbers inside blood monocytes. On the other hand, severe systemic manifestations may accompany the presence of large numbers of organisms in the blood such as the pneumococcus, meningococcus, or group A S. pyogenes. This is called a septicemia. Bacteria may succeed in setting up foci of infection in areas where the blood flow is slow enough, or they may establish multiplication in sites previously damaged by disease or injury, such as Streptococcus viridans on abnormal heart valves producing subacute bacterial endocarditis, or staphylococci in the traumatized long bones of children may lead to osteomyelitis. Depending on the site of the infection, the liver and lung may receive many organisms during bacterial invasion of the bloodstream. The lung, liver, spleen, and bone marrow may also serve as important foci of dissemination of organisms, as in brucellosis, leptospirosis, and typhoid fever. Rashes accompany the dissemination of many viral and some bacterial infections to the skin. They may result from localization and growth of the organism in small blood vessels, producing thrombosis, infarction, and hemorrhage as in the rickettsial diseases, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, and typhus, as well as the petechial and purpuric lesions of meningococcemia. Immunopathologic processes involving sensitized lymphocytes, antibodies, and immune complexes play a role in many rashes, especially viral. A bacterial toxin may induce the rash as in scarlet fever.

IgM is the predominant antibody produced during the first exposure to an antigen. In serum, pentameric IgM has the highest binding avidity of any of the isotypes of immunoglobulin. It is extremely efficient at agglutinating bacteria and is an excellent opsonin, promoting phagocytosis by macrophages and neutrophils. In addition, IgM is the most effective antibody at activating complement. 2. IgG is the most abundant immunoglobulin in serum, making up 75% of the total serum antibody. It is the predominant antibody produced in a secondary or anamnestic immune response. Four distinct subclasses of IgG are recognized. All four subclasses of IgG can activate the complement cascade, although with widely different efficiencies. In addition, specific receptors for the constant region of all four IgG subclasses have been identified on a variety of cell types, including macrophages, mast cells, neutrophils, and lymphocytes. The combination of antibody with these other cell types either confers opsonic capacity or leads (in the presence of specific antigen) to the release of mediators. On lymphocytes, the binding of immunoglobulin molecules to such receptors appears to have regulatory functions, such as switching off the secretion of antibody. IgG is the only immunoglobulin that is capable of crossing the placenta, a process that is mediated by a specific receptor for IgG located on placental cells. In addition to its other activities, IgG is the most important neutralizing antibody in the serum, by virtue of its relative abundance. 3. IgA is the principal antibody found in local secretions. IgA antibody can be found in tears, saliva, milk, sweat, lungs, nasal passages, the urogenital tract, and the gut. IgA plays a crucial role in the defense of mucosal surfaces, neutralizing bacteria and viruses at local mucosa before they have an opportunity to invade. The presence of large quantities of IgA antibody in milk and colostrum enables the efficient transfer of maternal humoral immunity to newborn infants. IgA is incapable of fixing complement. It serves primarily as an agglutinating and neutralizing antibody. IgA in local secretions occurs as a dimer, bound by J chain. IgA transport to local mucosa is mediated by a molecule called the secretory piece, produced by cells adjacent to mucosal sites. IgA associates with the secretory piece on the cell surface and is endocytosed, transported across the cytoplasm, and deposited at local mucosa. 4. IgE makes up less than 0.01% of the total serum antibody. IgE is best recognized for its role in mediating immediate-type hypersensitivity, caused by the degranulation of mast cells and basophils in various mucosal tissues. IgE has an important role in the response against parasites. The purpose of the release of vasoactive substances when IgE bound to the surface of a mast cell or basophil encounters antigen is to enhance the accessibility of neutrophils and eosinophils, serum IgG, and complement to the site of parasitic infection. 5.

It is mediated by T lymphocytes. T cells are superficially indistinguishable from B cells. The T-cell receptor for antigen is structurally similar to the B-cell receptor, and yet the two cell types recognize specific antigen in fundamentally different ways. B cells recognize intact antigen and respond with the production of molecules that bear an exact copy of the surface receptor's binding site. T cells have no capacity for recognizing intact antigen. To engage a T-cell receptor, antigen first must be processed into small peptides, which are then inserted into the binding cleft of a major histo-compatibility (MHC) antigen. The MHC antigens are a highly polymorphic family of dual polypeptide proteins, at least some of which are expressed on nearly every cell type in the body. Because there are at least several hundred allelic variants of MHC antigens, and because no human being can express more than 12 different variants (up to two each of six different subclasses), the likelihood of two randomly selected individuals expressing the same panel of MHC antigens is remote in the extreme. Thus, the MHC antigens expressed by an individual to a very large extent define the property of self. This is particularly true for T cells. During the process of maturation in the thymus, nascent T cells undergo a rigorous selection process, and only cells displaying an antigen receptor that has a weak binding affinity for one or more self-MHC antigens are permitted to complete their differentiation into mature T cells. Cells with no affinity for self and cells with too strong an affinity, i.e., strong enough to activate a T cell on its own, are destroyed. When a foreign peptide is inserted into the cleft of an MHC molecule, its affinity is altered. A small number of T cells, perhaps one in half a million, will bind to this altered MHC with a high enough affinity to activate.

Once activated, these cells recognize their specific combination of foreign peptide and MHC on a target cell and have two methods for dispatching the target. The first involves the deposition of perforin pores, which bear a striking resemblance to the terminal complement complex, onto the surface of the cell. The second approach is to induce apoptosis in the target, directing the cell to essentially commit suicide. Both processes result in the destruction of the target cell.

All of these cell types are capable antigen-presenting cells, since CD4 + T cells also have the central role in the regulation of T-cell responses; the limited expression of class II antigens in the body is thought to reflect a safety restraint aimed at limiting the responsiveness of immune cells.

As such, the level of intercellular interaction in the immune system is extraordinarily high. As mentioned previously, B-cell responses are generally not possible in the absence of T-cell help. If specific cytokines, such as IL-2 for proliferation, are not made available to the antigen-stimulated B cell, a suboptimal response will result. The generation of T-cell help, in turn, is absolutely dependent on the presence of a suitable antigen-presenting-cell-bearing peptide on a class II MHC antigen.

Risk factors that contribute to lower tract infection in women include sexual intercourse, diaphragm-spermicide use, and voiding behavior. (84) UTI is the most common infectious disease of the elderly and is especially prevalent in debilitated, institutionalized older individuals. Unlike UTI in younger women, which tends to be related to frequency of sexual intercourse and is uncomplicated, in the elderly it is more difficult to treat and its pathogenesis is related to abnormal bladder function, bladder outlet obstruction, vaginal and urethral atrophy, use of long-term indwelling catheters, and puddling related to bed rest. The spectrum of organisms causing infection relates to the ecology of the patients' environments; those residing in nursing homes, and especially with permanent indwelling catheters, tend to have a greater variety of pathogenic organisms, many of which may be relatively antibiotic resistant. (85) The immediate diagnosis of UTI is based on relatively simple techniques. The presence of pyuria and bacteriuria, the two most important indicators of UTIs, is most accurately determined by standard techniques.

C. trachomatis (immunotypes D-K) is responsible for 30-50% of symptomatic cases of nongonococcal urethritis (NGU) and is more common in white than in black men and in higher than in lower socioeconomic levels.

These are infections acquired after an admission to a hospital and are discussed in detail in Chapter 25. More than 2 million patients annually in the United States develop nosocomial infections. In the largest study to date, 5.7% of 159,526 patients in 338 hospitals developed a nosocomial infection. (90) Each such patient stayed an average of four extra days in the hospital, paying an extra $2,100 for each infection. Some 19,027 deaths were directly attributable to a nosocomial infection and it was a contributory factor in 58,092. In reports to the CDC's National Nosocomial Infections Surveillance program in 1991-1992, which involves 149 hospitals, urinary tract infections were the most common site (33.1%), followed by pneumonias (15.5%), surgical site infections (14.9%), and primary bloodstream infections (13.1%), and this order was similar irrespective of the size of the hospital. Among 71,411 isolates from all sites, E. coli and S. aureus were the most common (12% each), followed by coagulase-negative staphylococcus (11%), Enterococcus spp. (10%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (9%), Enterobacter spp. (6%), and all other organisms 5% or less. (90) Unfortunately, the major nosocomial pathogens either are naturally resistant to clinically useful antibiotics or are potentially able to develop resistance.

Simple microscopic examination of an unstained, uncentrifuged specimen of urine that shows bacteria indicates a quantitative bacterial count of 10 4 -10 5 /ml, and the morphology may point to the proper etiology.

Commercial kits are becoming rapidly available for many of these techniques. (94) A number of molecular techniques are now being used for both phenotypic and genotypic identification of organisms and are well reviewed in a recent article. (95) Those used for epidemiological studies of phenotypic variants include antibiotic resistance patterns (antibiograms), biotyping, bacteriocin production, serotyping, outer membrane protein analysis, phage typing, immunoblotting, and multilocus enzyme electrophoresis. The limitations of these techniques are that they do not take genetic exchange or mutations into account, are nonspecific, and are not widely applicable. Independent isolates of the same strain may vary in their phenotype. Genotypic typing methods are used to identify the genetic composition of the organism by study of chromosomal, plasmid, or transposon DNA. The techniques include plasmid profile analysis, restriction endonuclease analysis, ribotyping, pulsed field electrophoresis, polymerase chain reaction digests, arbitrarily primed polymerase chain reactions, and nucleotide sequence analysis. Variations in the reproducibility and discriminatory power of the two general methods differ; in general, those that involve genotypic methods are better. Their application permits identification of specific patterns of transmission of an organism, differentiation between reinfection and reactivation, and recognition of the geographic distribution of a particular strain. The epidemiology of antibiotic resistance involves (1) R plasmid spread (inter-and intraspecies), (2) strain (clonal) dissemination, and (3) transposition of R genes into R plasmids or chromosomes. These many techniques now provide the epidemiologist the means for the rapid identification of many organisms, including the specific strain involved, so that transmission patterns can be followed. Of special interest are the so-called emerging infections, which in the United States include E. coli O157:H7 disease, cryptosporidiosis, coccidioidomycosis, multidrug-resistant pneumococcal disease, vancomycin-resistant enterococcal infections, and Hantavirus infections. Special surveillance and diagnostic centers have been established to monitor these infections. (96) The culture media used will depend on the organisms suspected and whether they are aerobic or anaerobic. Blood agar plates and broth cultures are widely used as a starting point. See individual chapters for specialized media for specific organisms. A useful table indicating the bacteria found by common culture media (and the media used), by type of specimen (urine, respiratory secretions, genital, etc.), and the specialized media needed to detect organisms missed by these standard procedures is available in the appendix of a recent microbiology text. (32) Once the organism is isolated its antibiotic sensitivity is usually determined and is useful not only in the selection of the proper antibiotic but also in \"fingerprinting\" the organism for epidemiological tracing. However, this is not necessary for some organisms that are known to be uniformly sensitive to certain antibiotics or that are uniformly resistant to all but one or two antibiotics. In vitro antibiotic testing is not always relevant to a particular infection, especially if the infection is due to mixed organisms. It often does not provide quantitative data or express the effect of an antibiotic on different points in the growth cycle of the organism, and the testing procedure may not include the antibiotic best suited to the clinical situation. The tests must be made on organisms obtained before antibiotic therapy is initiated.

The presence of specific IgM antibody is often diagnostic of an acute infection, if demonstrable, as for B. burgdorferi, the cause of Lyme disease, but the laboratory diagnosis of this infection is subject to wide variation and standardization of procedures is badly needed. For rickettsial infections, both the organism itself and Proteus antigens are useful in serological diagnosis. In streptococcal infections, an increase occurs in a group of antienzyme tests but is too late to be useful diagnostically; a high titer is said to place the person at greater risk of developing rheumatic fever. In syphilis, a great variety of serological tests have been used, employing both nontreponemal and treponemal antigens. The VDRL test is most widely employed as an initial test and is highly sensitive and well standardized but lacks high specificity. The diagnosis can be confirmed by the fluorescent-treponemal-antibody absorption (FTA-Abs) or hemagglutination (MHA-TP) tests, which are highly specific and available at most state and a few large private laboratories, as well as at the CDC.

False-positive rises can result from cross-reacting antigens, nonspecific inhibitors, double infection with the other organism causing the illness, and antibody response to vaccination rather than to natural infection. False-negatives, i.e., failure to demonstrate an increase in titer, can occur when the serum specimen is taken too late in illness, two samples are taken too close together to demonstrate a titer rise, the organism is a poor immunogen, the wrong antigen is used in the test, some inhibitor or nonspecificity (as in immunofluorescence tests) obscures a true rise, or the wrong type of test is used for the timing of the serum specimens. Serological tests are also not available for many bacterial infections. One of the common problems is the interpretation of a high IgG antibody titer in a single specimen. The demonstration of IgM-specific antibody is strong but not absolute evidence of a recent infection; it could result from reactivation. The presence of antibody to a rare infection, or to one not usually present in that area as in a returned traveler, or the history of some recent unusual exposure such as in hunting, a new occupation, or a visit from overseas friends also adds weight to the recency of that infection.

(100) A recent book has reviewed the development and subsequent changes in these postulates. (101) The postulates are presented in Table 12 . While fulfillment of these postulates provides strong evidence of a causal association, the failure to fulfill them does not exclude this relationship. Even at the time of presentation in 1890, Koch himself recognized some of these limitations, especially the inability to reproduce some diseases in experimental animals. At that time, this was true of cholera, typhoid fever, diphtheria, leprosy, and relapsing fever, for which Koch felt it necessary to fulfill only the first two postulates. Since then, many other limitations have been recognized, (102) as our knowledge of microbiology, epidemiology, and pathogenesis has increased. These include recognition of the asymptomatic carrier state, which would invalidate the second postulate if an individual were carrier of organism A and his disease was caused by organism B. The concepts of multiple causation, of inapparent infection, and of the biological gradient of disease are also limitations. The postulates are not generally applicable to viral and parasitic diseases or for organisms that cannot be grown in culture or induce an immune response. Criteria are also needed for chronic diseases. In an effort to cover these various possibilities, a \"unified\" set of postulates based mainly on epidemiological criteria have been proposed. (103) It is clear that all postulates and guidelines of causation are limited by the technology available to prove them and by our knowledge of disease mechanisms at the time.

With this in mind, the CDC has issued recommendations for the prevention of transmission of HIV, hepatitis B, and other blood-borne pathogens in medical care settings. (115) These standard precautions are to be applied to all patients, including those coming into emergency rooms, where there is often risk of such exposures and the status of the patients is usually unknown. The approach also applies to outpatient settings that involve handling of blood or body fluids. Standard precautions specifically involve the use of gloves whenever contact with blood or other such body fluids is anticipated and other barrier techniques (masks, gowns, and protective eyewear) whenever splashes of such fluids are expected. This would apply to the use of gloves when touching blood and body fluids, mucous membranes, or soiled articles or surfaces, and when doing venipunctures or inserting intravenous lines, and to the use of masks in operative or invasive procedures.

Immunization. The specific protection of the individual against infection and disease is the key to modern preventive practice. It may be either passive protection by the transfer of a specific antibody (or antitoxin) from another person or animal immune to it or active immunization through induction of antibody by the organism itself or an antigenic derivative of it. An ideal vaccine closely simulates the protection from natural infection, i.e., it produces good humoral, cellular, and local immunity of long duration. Preferably, it should be better than the short-lived or incomplete immunity found in certain infections such as cholera or shigellosis. It should be in a form of administration and at a cost acceptable to the public. The cost of the vaccine and any side effects should be less than those of the natural disease prevented by it. These ideals are most closely met by well-attenuated live vaccines or antigenic derivatives thereof. The live bacterial vaccines include bacille Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin (BCG) for tuberculosis, a recently developed and licensed oral vaccine (using strain Ty21a) for typhoid fever, and tularemia vaccine. BCG is sparsely used in the United States, and controversy exists about its efficacy (see below). Tularemia vaccine is used in rather small, high-risk groups.

The Institute of Medicine of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences has published a comprehensive evaluation of vaccine priorities for both developed and developing countries based on their feasibility, cost, need, effectiveness, acceptability, side reactions, and other factors. (117) In developing countries, the WHO's Expanded Program in Immunization is making an enormous effort to vaccinate the young children of the world against six targeted diseases using diphtheria-pertussis-tetanus (DPT), polio, measles, and BCG vaccines, as well as hepatitis B and yellow fever vaccine in some regions. Important progress is being made, and the worldwide coverage in 1996 was approximately 70%. Other organizations are now joining in this effort, as part of a \"Child Survival Program,\" and there is a focus on \"growth, oral rehydration therapy, breast feeding, and immunization\" (GOBI). The Children's Vaccine Initiative, the organization that manages the technological transition toward new vaccines, has outlined the desired characteristics of such vaccines and has stated that they should be capable of being given orally in the first year of life. In the United States, the recommendation by states that all children be immunized before being allowed into school has greatly expanded coverage in this country. Of the nine diseases against which children are routinely vaccinated, the reported number for five of these and for congenital rubella syndrome was at or near the lowest levels ever. (118) The reported number of these five diseases in 1996 were diphtheria (2 cases), measles (508 cases), poliomyelitis (wild virus-0 cases), rubella (238 cases), and tetanus (36 cases). Only seven cases of congenital rubella syndrome were reported. Measles is a good example of the progress made. After an outbreak of measles between 1989 and 1991 that involved more than 50,000 cases and 11,000 hospitalizations, reported cases declined from 9,643 cases in 1991 to only 281 in 1993.

(120) For example, sero-surveys indicated that 49-66% of persons 60 years or over lacked reliable protective levels of circulating antitoxin against tetanus, and 41-84% lacked adequate protection against diphtheria. Tetanus is a completely preventable disease, and persons over 50 account for 70% of reported cases; thus, special emphasis must be placed on this age group for tetanus boosters, or an initial series if not previously vaccinated. Pneumococcal vaccine is also badly underutilized as indicated by the fact that less than 10% of the higher-risk groups have been vaccinated. A similar lack of protection of our adult population exists against many viral diseases, especially influenza, measles, mumps, rubella, and hepatitis B, as well as pneumonia. Today, some 50,000-70,000 adults die each year of influenza, pneumococcal infections, and hepatitis B, with a cost to society of these and other vaccinepreventable diseases of adults exceeding 10 billion dollars each year. (121) Detailed recommendations have been issued to improve this situation (121) and a call for action issued by the CDC. (122) Recommendations for the immunization of persons with altered immunocompetence, such as AIDS, have been made by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practice (ACIP). In general, live viral or bacterial vaccines are contraindicated in persons with severe immunodeficiency due to any cause, including HIV-infected persons. However, evaluation and testing for HIV infection of asymptomatic persons are not necessary before administering measles-mumpsrubella (MMR) vaccine, since no documented serious adverse reactions have been noted in either asymptomatic or symptomatic persons infected with HIV. Thus, MMR vaccine is recommended for both adults and children when otherwise indicated, regardless of HIV status. Enhanced, inactivated poliomyelitis vaccine is preferred in HIV-infected persons, as is pneumococcal vaccine of these persons over age 2 years. HIV-infected children under 2 years should receive Hib vaccine according to the routine schedules. Both HIV-infected children may have suboptimal immune responses to such vaccines. Recent studies suggest, however, that the benefits of measles, mumps, and rubella vaccines outweigh the risks to children with AIDS, at least in developing countries. It should be noted that in developing countries where the risks of exposure are higher, greater use of live vaccines is recommended. The WHO thus recommends use of standard Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI) vaccines in persons with symptomatic or asymptomatic HIV infections, (123) but suggests that inactivated poliomyelitis vaccine (IPV) be considered as an alternative to oral polio vaccine (OPV). Some complications have arisen with BCG vaccine in such immunosuppressed children, and its use should be suspended in unimmunized individuals with symptomatic AIDS in countries where the other targeted diseases remain serious risks; in asymptomatic HIV-infected individuals in areas where the risk of tuberculosis is high, BCG is recommended at birth or soon thereafter. Guidelines should be consulted for updated recommendations, as data are often incomplete. Separate needles are required to avoid the possibility of parenteral transmission of HIV (and hepatitis B virus).

The available inactivated vaccine offers rather poor protection (about 50%) over a short period (3-6 months); the transmission of infection is not prevented. No country or territory currently requires immunization for entry. (126) However, local authorities may require it, and one dose satisfies such regulations and is valid for 6 months. For persons highly exposed in highly endemic areas, a three-dose primary series is given 1 week to 1 month apart and a booster dose every 6 months. The vaccine is probably not effective against the newly discovered V. cholera 039 strain. A number of oral cholera vaccines are under development and testing, some of which contain the V. cholera 039-Bengal strain. Table 13 ).

Meningococcal infections can result in epidemics but, in U.S. civilians, most commonly occur as single cases or localized clusters, with a third of the cases occurring in persons 20 years of age or over. Two polysaccharide vaccines are currently available in the United States: a bivalent A-C and a quadrivalent vaccine containing A, C, Y, and W-135 polysaccharides. A single dose of either is adequate to induce serospecific immunity. (32) Routine vaccination is not recommended in the United States because of the relatively low risk of infection and because a good group B antigen is not available. Vaccine usage is recommended as an adjunct to antibiotic chemoprophylaxis for household and other close contacts of persons with meningococcal disease due to serotypes A, C, Y, and W-135. The quadrivalent vaccine is recommended for travelers to endemic areas. The duration of protection is unclear. Side reactions are infrequent and mild, but the safety for pregnant women has not been established. Because of the high risk in military recruits, they have received meningococcal vaccine on entering the services since the early 1970s. Currently, they receive groups A, C, Y, and W-135. (See also Chapter 23.) 14.2.3.7. Plague. The vaccine consists of formalininactivated organisms; its efficacy has not been critically evaluated. It should be given only to high-risk groups such as field and laboratory personnel exposed to the organism and possibly to workers in plague enzootic or endemic rural areas where avoidance of rodents, fleas, and wild rabbits is not feasible (agricultural advisors, Peace Corps volunteers, or military personnel on maneuvers). (24) The schedule consists of five injections, with dosage varying with age. In the face of continued exposure, single booster doses at about 6-month intervals are given for two doses, then at 1-to 2-year intervals. Local reactions are common, sterile abscesses are rare, and systemic reactions (fever, headache, and malaise) may occur on repeated injections. (See also Chapter 27.) 14.2.3.8. Pneumococcal Infections. The estimated annual incidence of pneumococcal pneumonia in the United States is 68-260 cases per 100,000 population and of bacteremia is 7-25 per 100,000. Mortality is highest in patients with bacteremia, meningitis, underlying medical conditions, and those over 60 years of age. The currently available pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine contains purified capsular materials from 23 types of S. pneumoniae, which together account for 87% of recent bacteremic pneumonia in the United States. The vaccine is particularly recommended for three groups: (1) adults with chronic diseases, especially of the cardiovascular or pulmonary systems; (2) adults with chronic illnesses specifically associated with an increased risk of pneumococcal infection or its complications (splenic dysfunction, Hodgkin's disease, multiple myeloma, cirrhosis, alcoholism, renal failure, CSF leaks, and in immunosuppressed patients); and (3) older adults, especially those 65 years of age and over, regardless of whether they are healthy or diseased. Vaccination is recommended for hospitalized patients in these high-risk groups before discharge. A single dose is recommended without a booster. Mild side reactions consisting of erythema and pain at the site of injection occur in about half the recipients. Medicare helps pay the cost in these designated groups. Pneumococcal infections are also a problem in young children in developing countries, so that there is increasing interest in the use of the vaccine in these groups. (See also Chapter 28. Tuberculosis. This disease remains the most important cause of death in the world due to an infectious agent. It is a major killer of individuals in persons aged 20-30 years. In 1994, the WHO declared this disease to be a public health emergency, (128) and it is believed to be \"out of control\" in many parts of the world. The WHO identified 10 industrial countries in which cases of tuberculosis increased 5-33% in recent years. In the United States, an estimated 15 million persons are believed to be infected. The increase of infection in HIV-infected persons with the emergence of multidrug-resistant strains in this group and in others who were inadequately treated is of special concern. Such resistant strains spread readily to others. About 4.5% of tuberculosis in the United States was associated with HIV infection, and a rise to 13.8% is anticipated by the year 2000. As Comstock (129) has pointed out, the patterns of change and reasons for it are multiple and complex both in the United States and other areas of the world. While HIV is widely blamed, there are many other factors such as migration, poverty, malnutrition, and decreased tuberculosis control efforts, and it is difficult to assess the relative importance of each in the trends observed. In 1991, 56% of active cases were reported among Hispanics and African Americans. The only vaccine available is BCG, and contradictory evidence exists as to its efficacy. An excellent brief review has recently summarized the evidence. (130) More people have received BCG vaccine than any other vaccine, yet its efficacy remains in doubt. It is a part of the routine WHO EPI program. For example, the WHO estimates that 85% of all children born in 1990 received BCG vaccine in their first year of life. Estimates of its efficacy range from 0 to 80% in different settings. Such great variation has been attributed to different vaccine strains, methodological differences, variation in the infecting organism in different countries, the genetic background of the exposed groups, and environmental interactions with other mycobacterial strains in the population. Indeed, a higher efficacy has been seen against leprosy than tuberculosis in some studies. One recent meta-analysis involving 14 trials and 12 observational studies concluded that BCG reduced the risk of tuberculosis by 50%, (131) despite great heterogeneity in the data. In another meta-analysis of results showing homogeneity, BCG was 86% effective against miliary tuberculosis and tuberculous meningitis; the preventive effect against pulmonary tuberculosis showed such heterogeneity that they did not calculate a summary measure. (132) It seems reasonable to believe that BCG is effective against the spread of tuberculosis within the body, such as miliary spread and spread to the meninges, but that its protection against infection varies greatly in different settings and with different vaccines. Comstock (129) has discussed the use of BCG and the CDC has outlined its use in control in a joint statement with the ACIP and the Advisory Committee on the Control of Tuberculosis. (133) General problems in the production standards for BCG and the need for recombinant technology in the development of a vaccine whose mechanism of action and efficacy can be better understood and evaluated have been recently presented. (134) (135) (136) BCG use is not routinely recommended in the United States because of the generally low incidence of disease and because BCG interferes with the interpretation of the tuberculin skin test. These recommendations may have to be modified for high-risk groups, in view of recent increases in incidence and resistant organisms. (See also Chapter 39.) 14.2.3.11. Typhoid. Not recommended for routine use in the United States or for international travel except for areas where there is a recognized risk of exposure to Salmonella typhi. It is recommended for travelers who will have prolonged exposure to potentially contaminated food and water in smaller cities or villages in rural areas in Africa, Asia, and Central and South America. An oral, live attenuated vaccine is licensed containing the Ty21a strain. It is taken in an enteric-coated capsule on alternate days for four doses, with a booster dose every 5 years if exposure continues. (137) An inactivated parenteral vaccine is also available and soon a Vi capsular polysaccharide vaccine will be available. Few reactions are due to the oral vaccine, but local and systemic reactions lasting 1-2 days are common with the inactivated parenteral vaccine. (See also Chapter 42.) 14.2.4. Antibiotic Prophylaxis. The success of preventing natural infection or disease or both with antibiotic prophylaxis depends on the sensitivity of the organism to the drug employed, whether single or multiple bacterial species are involved, the timing of administration in relation to infection, and the ability of the drug to reach effective concentrations in body sites before the organism is present. It has been employed in persons at high risk after known exposure in epidemics (meningococcus), in household contacts of cases (e.g., streptococcus, meningococcus, tuberculosis), and in sexual partners (gonococcus, syphilis), one of whom is infected. It has been employed after infection is diagnosed to prevent further spread or to limit complications (tuberculosis, rheumatic fever) or to limit the duration of the carrier state. The major limitations have been the development of antibiotic resistance, multiple organisms causing the disease, and poor patient compliance for long-term prophylaxis. Any mass prophylactic program aimed at a large group, especially a closed population, over a long term sets the stage for the development of resistance in the organism of interest as well as other circulating organisms. Antibiotic prophylaxis has met with debatable success when the bacterial sensitivity is not high, if the antibiotic is inhibitory but not bactericidal, if multiple organisms are involved (especially gram-negative), and if the risk of infection is relatively low, as in clean surgical operations. For greater detail, see books on clinical infectious diseases (38) or reviews on antibiotic usage, (138) as well as specific chapters in this book. Table 14 lists some uses of antibiotic prophylaxis. The most successful are the prevention of recurrent streptococcal infections in persons with rheumatic heart disease and the prevention of disease in persons with infections due to M. tuberculosis, especially recent infections. Antibiotic prophylaxis with sulfadiazine for sulfa-sensitive organisms or rifampin for sulfa-resistant organisms is advocated for family or close contacts of patients with meningococcal meningitis or outbreaks in closed settings. These principles apply in large community outbreaks when sulfadiazine is given on a mass basis for sulfonamide-sensitive meningococci; of resistant strains in this situation, rifampin is not recommended because of the possibility of developing resistance to this drug. (17) \"Epidemiological treatment\" after known sexual exposure to gonorrhea or syphilis is effective, but requires a full therapeutic regimen. Prevention of infection during and after surgery is advocated in surgical procedures at high risk to infection such as total hip and knee replacement, colonrectal surgery, and transurethral resection of the prostate. (139) Patients whose immune status is compromised by steroids, irradiation, alkylating and antimetabolic agents, and other immunosuppressive drugs are at high risk to certain bacterial, fungal, and viral organisms, including some that are not normally pathogenic, but no antimicrobial prophylaxis has been effective. They may be placed in protective isolation (see Section 14.2.1) and closely watched and antibiotic therapy instituted if infection occurs. A possible exception to the ineffectiveness of antibiotics in preventing infections is the prophylactic use of isoniazid in immunosuppressed patients with inactive tuberculosis. Antibiotics or other prophylactic measures for prevention of traveler's diarrhea are recommended only for the long-term traveler in high-risk endemic areas (80, 106) ; for short-term visitors, bismuth subsalicylate has proved useful.
