Our experiment provides important proof-of-concept that such experiments are not only possible, but yield recognizable results as well as new insights, blurring the line between laboratory and field experiments. Specifically, our findings from 8 different experimental economics games and tasks replicate existing results from traditional laboratory experiments despite the fact that subjects play those games/task in a specific order and regardless of whether the experiment was conducted in person or remotely. We further leverage our large subject population to study the effect of large (N = 100) versus small (N = 10) group sizes on behavior in three of the scalable games that we study. While our results are largely consistent with existing findings for small groups, increases in group size are shown to matter for the robustness of those findings.",

However, recent advances in cloudbased platforms and mobile payments mean that laboratory-type studies can now be conducted outside of the traditional laboratory setting, involving much larger numbers of participants thereby blurring the line between laboratory and field experiments. In this paper, we report on a break-through, incentivized experimental study comparing the behavior of subjects playing eight classic interactive laboratory games or individual decision-making tasks either in-person or remotely using entirely mobile devices. Our experiment took place during a summer camp at Xiamen University in July 2019 (Experiment 1, 633 subjects). It was repeated again with different Xiamen summer school participants a year later, in July 2020 (Experiment 2, 585 subjects), when subjects played remotely from home during the COVID-19 pandemic.",

            "text": "We have several aims in conducting and reporting on this experiment. First, we demonstrate proof-of-concept that such large scale, interactive experimentation can be done entirely using subjects' own mobile platforms to both collect data and to make payments. Second, we show that our approach yields recognizable and comparable results. Indeed our results with small groups of 2-10 subjects largely replicate findings from traditional laboratory studies despite the fact that subjects in our experiment play several different games in a sequence (a within-subjects design) as opposed to the between-subjects designs of most laboratory studies. Third, we further demonstrate that experimental results are not substantially different if we conduct our large scale experiment in-person, as in the 2019 Experiment 1, or remotely with live streaming as in the 2020 Experiment 2. These encouraging findings support the prospect of conducting efficacious and incentivized human subject experiments remotely online without sacrificing comparability to results from traditional in-person laboratory experiments. Fourth, we leverage our large subject pool to explore how group size differences of 10 (small) versus 100 (large) subjects can matter for the play of three highly scalable classic laboratory games: a p-beauty contest game, a voter turnout game, and a linear public goods game. We find some significant differences in behavior between the large and small groups among the three games we study for which group size is easily scalable, which reinforces the notion that group size can be an important factor in evaluating laboratory findings. In addition to the three games exploring group size effects, subjects also participated in a 2-player ultimatum bargaining game [1] , an individual risk preference elicitation task similar to [2] , a 2-player centipede game played 3 times [3] , a 2-player trust game [4] and an individual 3-round real-effort task exploring gender differences in compensation schemes [5] . The collection of data on the play of many games by the same subjects enables comparisons to be made in the way subjects behave across games, which we believe will be an important area for future research using the large scale mobile experimental methodology that we propose here, and we provide some preliminary analysis in the S1 File.",

Exceptions include studies using mobile devices to provide subjects with nudges to complete certain tasks, e.g., an online course e.g., [7] or energy conservation, e.g., [8] . The use of subjects' own mobile devices to collect experimental data on games of strategic interaction and/or economic decision making tasks is still nascent and typically involves collection of data on a single game or task, e.g., [9] . By constrast, we consider play by subjects of a large number of games of interest to experimental researchers and show that behavior is similar to that found in traditional laboratory settings.",

However, that study primarily examines the stability of individual characteristics like risk-taking, confidence and cognitive abilities across populations, with only a few interactive games (a dictator game and a prisoner's dilemma game). By contrast, in this study we compare whether there is any difference in the play of a wider variety of interactive laboratory games as well as some individual decision tasks all using mobile devices. In three of these games we vary the scale of the groups in which subjects interact with one another. We compare play of such games and tasks in person (as in a laboratory study where an observer is present) or remotely by the same sample of subjects, in our case university students and like [10] we find little evidence that observer effects matter.",

            "text": "The idea that group size can matter for experimental results has also been previously examined. In one of the earliest studies of the public goods game, [11] considered groups of size 4, 10, 40 and 100 and found that average contributions increased with the group size, e.g., from 10 to 100, but only if the marginal per capita return (MPCR) on contributions to the public good was low (0.30). [12] replicate this finding in comparisons of groups of size 4 and 8, but find that larger groups contribute less than smaller groups when the MPCR is high (0.75). [13] report on beauty contest games conducted among the readership of three newspapers resulting in sample sizes of 1,468 to 3,696 participants. [14] study voter turnout in the laboratory in small groups of size 3 as well as in larger groups of up to size 53, while [15] conduct a similar experiment involving groups of size 30 or 300 using an Mechanical Turk's online workforce. A main finding from all of these studies is that group size can matter for the behavior observed. Other experimental studies focusing on group size effects include [16, 17] who look at how large groups of players, up to size 100, play the volunteer's dilemma; [18] [19] [20] who look at asset pricing in markets with large number of subjects, between 40-300. Still, these studies are typically conducted on different dates in time or on different populations (laboratory subjects versus newspaper readers, combining several laboratories at once) or lack other elements of control, e.g., newspaper readers can discuss their choices with one another. Thus, an important contribution of our paper is that we conduct the large versus small group treatments simultaneously via random assignment of members of a single population to either the small or large group sizes. Thus, our design does not mix populations making better use of random assignment and therefore resulting in a more controlled test of group size effects. Nevertheless, we will compare our results on group size differences with the existing literature to examine whether there is any impact from collecting data on mobile platforms or whether data is gathered in-person versus remotely.",

We chose to include the beauty contest game in our experiment comparing large and small groups as this game is one for which the payoff incentives do not change as the size of the group gets larger. Fig 1 shows the cumulative distributions of guesses in the 2/3-beauty contest game across experiments, treatments, and rounds. For comparison purposes we also include [21]'s lab data and [22]'s Financial Times experimental data for the 2/3 \u00d7 the average treatment. We use Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) tests to show that guesses in our large group treatment are distributed lower and thus closer to the equilibrium prediction of 0 than in our small group treatment by round 2 of Experiment 1 (KS = 0.2709, p < 0.001) and by round 3 of both experiments (Experiment 1: KS = 0.5125, p < 0.001; Experiment 2: KS = 0.2450, p < 0.001), although the difference is not statistically significant in round 1 (Experiment 1: KS = 0.1457, p = 0.080; Experiment 2: KS = 0.0924, p = 0.251). We speculate that in larger groups, subjects may react to the greater competitive pressure by iterating their reasoning somewhat further than they would in smaller, less competitive groups. Alternatively, in larger groups the effects of outlier choices such as a guess of 100 may be more greatly diminished, and subjects may react to this difference by making guesses that are closer to the equilibrium prediction. In comparison with [21]'s data, we find using KS-tests that with the exception of round 1 of Experiment 1, there is no significant difference in the distribution of guesses over rounds 1-3 between [21]'s experimental data and the data from our Large group treatment (both Experiments 1 and 2). However, KS-tests reveal that the distributions of guesses in rounds 2-3 of our Small group treatment in both Experiments 1 and 2 are significantly different from [21]'s data in the direction of being further from the equilibrium prediction (p <.05 for all tests). Panel D of Fig 1 indicates that there are no differences in mean round 1 guesses between [21]'s data and any of our experiment/treatments, according to the bounds of 95% confidence intervals. Further, we do not find differences in mean guesses for rounds 2-3 in our large N = 100 treatment and [21]'s data with groups of size 15 \u2212 18. However, our small groups of size 10 have mean rounds 2-3 guesses that are greater than found in [21]'s data, significantly so in the case of Experiment 1. It may be that the 5-8 additional subjects in [21]'s experiment as compared with our small treatment group size of 10 are responsible for this difference.",

As panel A of Fig 1 clearly reveals, the distributions of guesses in all other experiments/treatments first order stochastically dominate the distribution of guesses found in Thaler's study which is a strong indicator that group size matters. What we add to the discussion is the demonstration that group size differences can become apparent as randomly formed groups of different sizes gain experience from repeated play, all using the same mobile platform to make choices and therefore reducing the role of possible confounding factors. Clearly, more research is needed on the precise threshold for which the size of a group begins to have statistically detectable effects on behavior in strategic interaction games such as the beauty contest.",

While IWW did not find significant differences between contributions made by players in small groups of 10 who were rewarded in extra credit points versus those who were incentivized (in earlier experiments reported on in [28]) using money payments, they do not report a similar comparison between the large group (N = 100) treatments they ran, where subjects were rewarded with extra credit points and treatments (not run) where subjects in the N = 100 group treatments earned monetary payments. Thus, it is possible that money payments, as in our design, reduce the amounts that participants are willing to contribute to the public good in the large group treatment, as this is where we find the greatest difference with IWW's findings.

For instance, a meta-analysis of 27 linear public goods game experiments by [30] found insignificant effects of group size for public good contributions. Fig 3 panels 3A -3C also reveal player classifications into two main behavioral types, free riders and altruists. Panels 1B-2B, and 1C-2C reveal differences in the patterns of contributions made by these different behavioral types over time between Large and Small groups. (See Section B.3 in S1 File for type definitions and a more detailed analysis). In Small groups we find a significantly larger proportion of free-riders while in Large groups we find a significantly larger proportion of altruists (Experiment 1: \u03c7 2 test p-value = .006; Experiment 2: \u03c7 2 test p-value = .039). We find similar patterns in our analysis of IWW's data where the differences in the proportions of the two types are statistically even greater (\u03c7 2 test p-value <.001), than in our data, which may further account for why we do not observe the large differences between large and small groups that they observe. These differences in the proportions of player types by group size are new and suggest that individual behavior may be quite malleable and dependent on the size of the group that subjects find themselves in. For instance, subjects in the large (small) group treatment might believe that free-riding is more likely (less likely) and might respond to such beliefs by contributing more (less). Future work on this topic would require a more careful, within-subject experimental design that varied the group size and elicited subjects' beliefs about the contributions of others.",

To keep this factor constant while maintaining the dominant strategy of 0 contributions, we would have to lower the MPCR in our large group treatment from.30 to.03 (making two changes rather than the single change in group size). While other researchers have made such adjustments (see, e.g., [28]), this is less easy to do when subjects are participants in a single, synchronous session, where they are given a single set of instructions and are randomly assigned to small or large group settings as in our experiment. Despite the 10 fold increase in the payoff from full contribution in the large group treatment, we do not find significant increases in the fraction of subjects' endowments they are willing to contribute to the public good, which is surprising. Further, we do not find that free riding behavior is more pervasive in larger groups as compared with smaller groups and in fact, the evidence seems to point to the opposite conclusion.",

Further, the asymptotes for Experiment 2 would be adjusted downward by 5.224. For the voter turnout game (the second column of the table), although players in large groups are initially less likely to follow the BNE, the group size effect vanishes in the long run while players in Experiment 2 are 12.09% more likely to follow BNE. In the public goods game (columns 3-5) players in large groups are asymptotically more likely to be strong free riders by 7.56% and altruists by 8.72%. However, players in large groups are 5.09% less likely to be a free rider suggesting that large groups have more extreme players in the long run. In the centipede game (columns 6-7) there is no difference in group sizes and for the two experiments in the estimated asymptotes, though a higher CRT score significantly reduces the probability that a subject chooses Take in the second node. Table 2 summarizes the regressions for the one-shot games. For the trust game (regression specifications 1-2), female subjects invest less on average and subjects in Experiment 2 invest more. In addition, specification (2) shows that players with higher CRT scores tend to return more. For the Ultimatum game (regression specifications 3-4), female proposers offer marginally more than do males. Furthermore, more risk averse proposers are more likely to make a higher proposal. From a logistic regression, we find that the responder's acceptance rate is monotonically increasing in the proposal offer and Experiment 2 has a higher conditional acceptance rate. Regarding the choice of tournament or piece rate in the individual choice experiment where subjects first have experience with both compensation schemes, we confirm that females are significantly less likely to choose the tournament than males and we find that risk averse subjects are also less likely to choose the tournament. On the other hand, winning the tournament (in Round 2) makes it more likely that a subject will choose the tournament scheme, particularly for males.",

We have further demonstrated that our approach does not require that subjects participate in-person; we have repeated our experiment a second time with subjects playing the same set of games remotely, and we obtain similar results. This replication of our original findings one year later with similar results builds confidence in the robustness of our findings and suggests that differences in the degree of physical control and/or social context between participating in-person or remotely may be less impactful on subject behavior for the scenarios we tested than was previously thought.",

Experiments hosted on the cloud can scale efficiently to run with hundreds or thousands of in-person or remote participants. Whether such scaling also require an adjustment to payoffs is an important consideration that will depend on the game being studied as we have noted. Nevertheless, user interfaces and incentives can be kept consistent across device types to ensure comparability of results and minimization of other confounding factors, such as the manner in which data are collected.

However, using commonpool online workforces also has its drawbacks; worker payments are low and set by marketwide conditions rather than by the experimenter; there is the risk of bot players, or players playing on multiple accounts at the same time leading to more screening of subjects and cleaning of data; experimenters typically have less control over participants' attention, participation, and interactions; finally, players on such platforms might be very experienced (less naive, less pro-social) about social science research questions than is the general population.
