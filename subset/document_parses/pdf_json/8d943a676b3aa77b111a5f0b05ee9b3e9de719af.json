Patient visits to the cancer clinic increase the potential risk of infection when the alternative is self-isolation at home, and some cancer treatments may predispose patients to moderate or severe harmful effects of COVID-19 (3, 4) . Current precautionary management decisions being made for cancer patients are based on assumptions supported by limited evidence, based on small case series from China and Italy (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) and larger series from New York (14, 15 ) and a recent consortium of 900 patients from over 85 hospitals in the USA, Canada, and Spain (16) . As a result of their limited sample sizes, most studies were not able to distinguish between the effects of age, cancer, and other comorbidities on COVID-19 outcomes in this population (17, 18) . Moreover, the case series from New York analyzed which patient characteristics are associated with COVID-19 death, but only made a comparison with noncancer patients (14, 15) . The first results of the COVID- 19 and Cancer Consortium provide insights from a large cohort in terms of COVID-19 mortality, though a wide variety of institutions with different COVID-19 testing procedures were included (16) . In addition, recently published prognostic studies in COVID-19 positive patients have been judged to be at high risk of bias, mainly due to non-representative selection of control patients, exclusion of patients who had not experienced the event of interest by the end of the study, high risk of model overfitting, and limited information on model building strategies used (19) .",

This may result in a delayed or missed COVID-19 diagnosis, which could lead to the confounding of cases and infection mortality rates, as well as late interventions for more life-threatening diseases (21) . In addition, COVID-19 may be a barrier to dignified and humane end-of-life cancer care (17) . Finally, the pandemic is causing huge service reconfiguration for both curative and palliative oncology care, resulting in fewer clinic visits due to social distancing (22) , cessation of screening, and delays or changes in treatments that will inevitably have serious impacts on cancer-related mortality and morbidity (17, 21) .

Most variables had several categories for the purpose of these descriptive analyses but were collapsed for the purpose of regression analyses due to the sample size of our cohort. Socioeconomic status (low, middle, high) was determined based on the English Indices of Multiple Deprivation for postcodes (27). Lymphocyte count (\u00d710 9 ) was categorized as \u22640.5, 0.6-0.8, 0.9-1.2, and >1.2 based on the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v.5 (CTCAE). For the other laboratory variables, we created tertiles instead of clinical cut-offs due to cancer patients already having abnormal values for most of these blood markers (Ferritin, C-reactive protein, and albumin). Radical treatment was defined as those patients with a chance of longterm survival or cure. For the second aim, we conducted logistic regression analyses. Mild/moderate COVID-19 was defined as pneumonia with or without sepsis (i.e., those patients managed on the ward), whereas severe COVID-19 was defined as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or septic shock (i.e., those patients where severity reached the criteria for Intensive Care Unit admission, if deemed clinically appropriate). These definitions were based on the WHO COVID-19 classification (28) . The models used to quantify the association between each factor and COVID-19 severity were defined through a directed acyclic graph (DAG) (Figure A1 ). Each factor was individually set as the main exposure variable in the model in order to determine the minimal adjustments required for each factor ( Table A1) .",

Higher levels of CRP and ferritin were also associated with more severe COVID-19 disease in infected cancer patients. During a median follow-up of 37 days, the following cancer patient characteristics were found to be positively associated with COVID-19 death: Asian ethnicity, palliative treatment, initial cancer diagnosis >24 months, dyspnea at presentation, and high CRP levels.

Zhang et al. (5) estimated that in their cohort, 29% of patients tested positive for COVID-19 following hospital admission, whereas this was estimated at 51% in our cohort. Interpretation of this statistic is difficult given the latency between exposure and manifestations of infection, meaning patients diagnosed after admission may have been infected outside of the hospital. Several studies (6, 10) noted that hypertension, diabetes, and coronary heart disease were the most commonly reported comorbidities. Our cancer cohort is similar in distribution of age, sex, and comorbidities to the case series reported to date. The ethnicity and SES of our COVID-19 positive cancer patients are most likely a reflection of the catchment area of our Cancer Center in South-East London (29) , covering more deprived boroughs (Lambeth and Southwark). Based on the number of cancer patients treated at our Cancer Center in 2019, about 49% of patients are of a White ethnic background. Variations observed with the published data in terms of cancer type, stage, and treatment may be a reflection of clinical practice (e.g., intensity of treatment and frequency of hospital visits), of relative cancer incidence, or of extent of treatment changes introduced as mitigation in the face of the emerging pandemic. For example, the most recently reported age-standardized lung cancer incidence rates for males and females in Wuhan are 54.1 and 19.1 per 100,000, whereas these are estimated to be 37.5 and 24.3 per 100,000 in London (30) . Early modification and prioritization of treatment was introduced at our center, in accordance with now-published guidance (31).",

Severe events were reported for 54% of the study population and mortality for 29% in the Zhang study, as compared to 18 and 22% in our cohort. Zhang et al. also reported that recent treatment within 14 days was associated with an increased risk of developing severe events (28 days) (5). This difference with our observations may be attributed to different definitions of severe events, as it was not entirely clear how these were defined by Zhang et al. As highlighted by Wynants et al. in their assessment of current statistical models published for COVID-19 (19) , there is a need for consistent use of outcome definitions. However, our observations of a positive association with CRP levels is in line with most COVID-19 studies published to date (32) . Apart from the CCC-19 Consortium (16) , no study to date has specifically looked at COVID-19 severity at presentation in COVID-19 positive cancer patients and hence our observation of an association with time since cancer diagnosis and presenting symptoms needs further validation in other large cohorts with homogenous definitions of inclusion criteria, testing strategies, and outcome measures. However, it is possible that time since cancer diagnosis is also a reflection of the extent of the disease and progression along the palliative patient pathway from diagnosis to death.",

In our cohort, the overall case fatality rate was 22%, with 25% for hematological cancers and 21% for solid tumors.

No firm conclusions in terms of prognostic modeling can be drawn as of yet (19) . Current analyses aimed to generate further hypotheses on patient or tumor characteristics indicative of severity or of death from COVID-19 in the context of cancer. Our data for some of the patient characteristics is limited; for example, smoking status was missing for 29% of patients and hence likely underestimates the proportion of smokers. COVID testing in the UK has only been implemented gradually during the period of our data collection, and there is selection bias in favor of patients being tested as inpatients. Our analysis is likely to have missed cancer outpatients under our care diagnosed with COVID-19 at other hospitals-however this is most likely to be an even more important issue for global Consortia with many hospitals only adding a few cases to the overall dataset.",

A standard clinical approach was used, with concurrent antibiotics to cover bacterial infection and early escalation of treatment decisions, including appropriateness of ITU admission. No standard use of other agents (steroids or antivirals) was applied unless within the context of a clinical trial. Moreover, our general oncological approach was to maintain standard anti-cancer treatment (including surgery, radiotherapy, and systemic treatments) where it was safe and reasonable to do so. Our Cancer Center managed to continue oncology services throughout the COVID pandemic, whereas other Centers may have redeployed staff that precluded this.",

Reflecting the general population, presenting with fever, dyspnea, gastro-intestinal symptoms, higher levels of CRP, or ferritin were also indicators of COVID-19 severity in the cancer population. Similarly, we noted that dyspnea at presentation, high CRP levels, and low levels of albumin were associated with death from COVID-19. With respect to cancer specific observations, patients who have lived longer with their cancer were found to be more susceptible to a greater infection severity, possibly reflecting the effect of a more advanced malignant disease-as almost half of the severe cohort were on third line metastatic treatment-or the impact of this infection. The latter was also found to be associated with COVID-19 death in cancer patients, as were being of Asian ethnicity and receiving palliative treatment. Further validation will be provided from other large case series, as well as from those including longer follow-ups, to provide more definite guidance for oncological care.",
