The UK Government's lockdown, implemented on March 23, 2020, stipulated severe restrictions on social contact, on the ability for many people to work, and greatly reduced access to services. Early indications suggest a serious impact on employment and liveli hoods, income, and personal debt. 1 Coupled with a substantial amount of worry about future insecurity, 2 there are increasing concerns about the mental health sequelae of the pandemic in the UK. 3 Policymakers, commissioners, and service providers need reliable information about mental health changes associated with the pandemic so that decisions are underpinned by knowledge of the scale of changes in population mental health, and who is most vulnerable to symptoms of mental distress. 4 Evidence from around the world on change in population mental health potentially attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic has been limited by use of convenience samples, modified or unvalidated mental health measures, and a lack of comparable, pre-COVID-19 baseline data against which to measure change; either within individuals or across the population as a whole. 5 One study found increased rates of psychological distress among US adults in April, 2020, compared with those in 2018, and that the increase was greatest in young people aged 18-24 years and women. 6 Well described demographic effects on mental health such as sex, age, and socioeconomic resources, in addition to pre-pandemic life circumstances, are likely to remain important determinants of people's mental health during the pandemic. 7 However, changes in mental health during the public health emergency might not be evenly distributed across the population. 8 Effects pertinent to lockdown include acute financial strain (low income, unemployment), household dynamics (domestic violence, living alone or with young children not attending nursery or school), 9 and having an underlying mental or physical health condition; specific effects include being a key worker exposed to potential infection. 10 For some people with high levels of socioeconomic security, the suspension of commuting, changes to education and work activities, and increased time with family potentially could have reduced stress and increased mental health and wellbeing. For others, anxieties about infection risk could be particularly high. 11 WHO has emphasised concerns for older adults, especially those in isolation, and those with cognitive decline or dementia, who could become more anxious, angry, stressed, agitated, or with drawn during the outbreak or while in quarantine. 4 We did a secondary analysis of data from a national, longitudinal cohort study to test the hypothesis that psychological distress in people in the UK increased one month into the COVID-19 emergency to a greater extent than expected given previous annual trends since 2014 . We hypothesised that the following groups would experience greater than expected deterioration in their mental health: younger and older people, women, ethnic minorities, those living without a partner, those living with children, key workers, those living in the poorest homes or who are unemployed, people in urban areas or regions first affected by COVID-19, and those with preexisting health conditions.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 476, "end": 477, "text": "1", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 546, "end": 547, "text": "2", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 638, "end": 639, "text": "3", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 933, "end": 934, "text": "4", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1299, "end": 1300, "text": "5", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1499, "end": 1500, "text": "6", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1739, "end": 1740, "text": "7", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1865, "end": 1866, "text": "8", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 2065, "end": 2066, "text": "9", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 2205, "end": 2207, "text": "10", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 2522, "end": 2524, "text": "11", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 2764, "end": 2765, "text": "4", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 3033, "end": 3037, "text": "2014", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "The UK Household Longitudinal Study (UKHLS; Understanding Society) is an ongoing panel survey of more than 40 000 households that began in 2009. 12, 13 From April 23 to April 30, 2020, members of households who participated in either of the two most recent UKHLS data collections (Waves 8 or 9), who were older than age 16 years, were invited to complete the first wave of the COVID-19 web survey. 14, 15 Invitations and reminders were sent via email, text message, or postal letter.

Mean scores were used for the outcome measure, rather than fitting a fixed-effects model for a binary outcome indicator.

Particularly steep increases were evident in young people and in women; for example, 44\u00b70% (95% CI 39\u00b72-48\u00b79) of women aged 16-24 reported clinically significant distress in April, 2020, compared with 32\u00b70% (27\u00b75-36\u00b75) in 2017-18 (appendix p 2). Table 4 presents the results of the fixed-effects regression analyses. The adjusted model controls for variables that were significantly associated with change in GHQ score in unadjusted analyses (p<0\u00b705): age, gender, household income, employment status, living with a partner, age of the youngest child in the household, and presence of an underlying health condition. Overall, GHQ-12 scores were 0\u00b748 points (95% CI 0\u00b707 to 0\u00b790) greater than would have been expected had trends observed in the years before the COVID-19 pandemic continued. There was clear evidence, after adjustment, for hetero geneous effects by age and gender (both effect modifiers, p<0\u00b70001). The mean score in 18-24-year-olds was 2\u00b769 points (95% CI 1\u00b789 to 3\u00b748) higher than would have been expected from the trends observed before the pandemic, and in 25-34-year-olds was 1\u00b757 points (0\u00b796 to 2\u00b718) higher. Adjusted estimates indicated that women experienced an increase of 0\u00b792 points (95% CI 0\u00b750 to 1\u00b735) whereas there was no evidence of higher than expected scores for men (0\u00b706, -0\u00b737 to 0\u00b748). Living with children in the house significantly modified the effect (p=0\u00b70003): those with children younger than 5 years had a 1\u00b745 (0\u00b779 to 2\u00b712) point increase in GHQ-12 score after adjustment for other factors.

The factors that we hypothesised would be most strongly linked with mental health deterioration were those associated with pre-existing health inequalities, such as gender, age, and low income, and factors specific to the unique circumstances of societal lockdown such as household dynamics, being a keyworker, and having a pre-existing health condition. Our findings suggest that being young, a woman, and living with children, especially preschool age children, have had a particularly strong influence on the extent to which mental distress increased under the conditions of the pandemic. Although rates of mental distress were higher in people who, before lockdown, were unemployed or in other economically inactive roles such as being a full-time student, the increase in mental distress relative to previous trends was greater among those who were employed before the pandemic. Some in this group will have lost their jobs, seen their income plummet, been furloughed, attempted to shift to homeworking, or been required to work in ways that exposed them to COVID-19 infection. As of late April, 2020, we found no clear pattern of variation in change by income group. However, consistent with established patterns, mental distress was more common among people living in low-income households. Contrary to our hypothesis, we did not find a significant additional independent increase in an individual's change in mental distress because of the COVID-19 pandemic according to other pre-existing characteristics. These characteristics included being an ethnic minority, living without a partner, being a keyworker, being unemployed, living in an urban area, or having a preexisting health condition that would put a person at greater risk from infection with COVID-19. For these categories, established pre-pandemic inequalities in mental health were main tained, but they had not significantly increased by the end of the first month of the lockdown period.

As the economic consequences of lockdown develop, when furloughs turn to redundancies, mortgage holidays expire, and recession takes effect, we believe it is reasonable to expect not only sustained distress and clinically significant deter ioration in mental health for some people, but emergence of well described long-term effects of economic recession on mental health including increasing suicide rates 22 and hospital admissions 23 for mental illness. 24 Women, young people, and those with preschool aged children are experiencing the greatest increase in mental distress.

The COVID-19 pandemic has produced many new challenges for health research, policy, and service provision. 3 The problems for mental health from COVID-19 and governmental responses to the pandemic are not necessarily new; instead, pre-existing mental health inequalities could become more entrenched and tackling them might be even more challenging. The pandemic has brought people's differing life circum stances into stark contrast: access to outside and inside space, household crowding, lack of school provision and childcare, food insecurity, domestic violence, addiction, access to internet and maintenance of social connectivity, as well as economic reserves are all relevant to mental health. 9, 10, 29, 30 An appropriate, proportionate response to mitigate and manage additional needs requires more high-quality information to be included in public health messaging about mental health during the pandemic, alongside adequately resourced services. 4, 31 Contributors KMA and SMcM devised the study concept.
