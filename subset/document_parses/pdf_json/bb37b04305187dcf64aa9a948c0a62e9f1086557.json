The usual way out of this dilemma is to impose norms, maintain reputations and incentivize individuals to contribute. In situations of high uncertainty, however, such as confrontations of protesters with a dictatorial regime, the usual measures are not feasible, but cooperation can be achieved nevertheless. We use an Ising model with asymmetric spins that represent cooperation and defection to show numerically how public goods can be realized. Under uncertainty, people use the heuristic of conformity. The turmoil of a confrontation causes some individuals to cooperate accidentally, and at a critical level of turmoil, they entail a cascade of cooperation. This critical level is much lower in small networks.",

People first have to agree on the public good and the way to realize it, but even if they arrive at a consensus, the provision of these goods is non-obvious because individuals are tempted to freeride on others' efforts. Cooperation is a dilemma [18] that usually requires time to solve, during which people develop norms and form a network to transmit information (gossip) about one another, on the basis of which reputations are established that in their turn are used to reward cooperators and punish defectors [8, 17] .",

It argues that if a critical number of actors starts cooperating, the others are won over to join in, thereby making cooperation self-reinforcing. Individuals are assumed to know at each moment how many cooperators there are in total, and to have fairly accurate expectations of their marginal payoff. On the basis thereof they can rationally decide to contribute to the public good or to freeload. In highly uncertain situations, however, these rationality assumptions are unlikely to hold true. Moreover, the theory does not show the effect of network topology, and does not explain the cooperation of the initiative takers before the critical point is reached. We, in contrast, explicate the effect of topology, explain the initiative takers endogenously, and instead of rationality assume one simple heuristic: under high uncertainty, people become conformists to the majority of their network neighbors [20] . This may turn out bad for them in a specific situation but may serve them on average over many occasions [2] . Conformism can be observed as behavioral synchronization [15] . When people conform to their initially defecting network neighbors, they might eventually cooperate when many others do, but who would start?",

Turmoil can be measured by participant's heart rates that indicate their arousal [13] or, in an information theoretic manner, by accelerating situational updates to the same effect [12] . Arousal causes \"trembling hands\" [6] as game theorists say, denoting a chance that some individuals accidentally cooperate, which in turn might entail a cascade of cooperation. An example of turmoil is the mutual provocation of soccer fans of opposing camps to a boiling point when fighting breaks out; their public good is the humiliation of their opponents. To show that turmoil can drive cooperation, we use an Ising model [1, 4] , for which we make the behavioral options (spins) asymmetric, reflecting the asymmetry of defection versus cooperation. This provides a parsimonious explanation of cooperation without the usual mechanisms developed over longer time, and without rationality assumptions.",

A cooperator's payoff is a share of the public good at a cost P C = r(M + C/n) \u2212 C, with a synergy parameter r > 1; a defector's payoff is P D = r(M \u2212 D/n) [19] . In conventional game theory, C = 1 and D = 0 [19] , but since payoffs are used only comparatively, it does not matter if they are negative here. If people believe that C \u2264 D, this payoff function does not apply and people will not cooperate anyway. If they believe that C > D, they may cooperate provided that enough others do. Because under high uncertainty, participants can't assess the synergy of their collective effort, don't know the costs and benefits, and in large groups can't see all cooperators, they can't calculate their payoff. The conformism heuristic then works as a collective lever that minimizes H and can maximize the mean payoff indirectly, even without individuals knowing the payoff function. Individuals' heuristic decision making is implemented computationally by the Metropolis algorithm [1] . Over a large number of Monte Carlo steps, a node i is chosen randomly, its behavior S i is flipped from D to C (or the other way around), and H is compared to H that has the flip implemented and is otherwise identical to H.

            "text": "The relation between cooperation, M , and turmoil, T , turns out to be qualitatively the same for all networks. At low turmoil, there is no cooperation but it emerges at a critical level T c , illustrated in Fig. 2 . Then the turmoil overcomes the \"energy\" barrier (the mountain in Fig. 1) , and drives the transition to the cooperative state. For as long as T < T c , the chance that this happens in a finite number of Monte Carlo steps is zero. If T keeps increasing beyond T c , the effect of turmoil becomes progressively more dominant until individuals randomly alternate cooperation and defection. Here, turmoil trumps conformism. If not by this chaos, cooperation will end when the public good is realized, others intervene, the participants get exhausted, or if they get to understand the situation (i.e. their uncertainty lowers) and start behaving strategically (i.e. freeride). Social networks, if large, are clustered and sparse with a skewed degree distribution [16] . We therefore examine the effects of clustering, density, degree distribution and size on the tipping point T c , and subsequently zoom in on local variations of S. As a characteristic example of clustering, we start with ten cliques (fully connected networks) with n = 10 each (Fig. 2) . When randomly rewiring ties with a probability p, the network becomes more random at higher p and thereby less clustered, as in small world networks [16] . Decreasing clustering results in increasing T c . In Fig. 3 this is demonstrated by starting with a strongly clustered network, and by rewiring the links, which will often form random cross-cluster connections. From the most strongly clustered network onward, the largest effect on T c is at small numbers of rewired ties. The effect of network size on the tipping point is larger than of clustering, though, in particular at the smallest network sizes (Fig. 4) . T c is also lower in sparser networks but the effect of density is much weaker than of size and more variable across simulation runs (not shown). When varying the degree distribution between Poisson and power law, T c does not change at all. In sum, changes of T c are largest at small network size, high clustering, and low density. Elsewhere we show that the Hamiltonian, once written in a symmetric form, becomes a conventional Ising model plus a global external field and a locally varying field that depends on the network [3] . We use this generalized form in a mean field analysis, from which we infer that for given \u0394, higher S 0 (that corresponds to a stronger interest in the public good) results in lower T c [3] . We now use different S 0 in a network with two clusters, keeping \u0394 = 0.75. When p = 0 the two groups are disconnected, but within-group links can be randomly rewired with a probability p and thereby connect the two groups. In (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) (19) (20) does not cooperate. Bottom row left: for the same two groups, ties are randomly rewired with a chance p = 0.1, resulting in connections between the groups that are visible in the adjacency matrix. Bottom row right: the group with higher S0 (1-10) wins over the other group (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) (19) (20) to cooperate after few Monte Carlo steps. The different gray tones for the two cooperating subgroups are due to their different S0 values.",

This solution holds for a broad range of networks, although the critical level of turmoil is markedly lower in small ones, which implies that turmoil-driven cooperation is more likely in small than in large groups. This result is consistent with empirical findings on violent group confrontations, where most of the physical violence is committed by small subgroups [5] . Small fighting groups increase overall turmoil, though, which may agitate larger groups to join. The model also shows that there is no need for especially zealous initiative takers (with high S 0 ) to get cooperation started, even though they help to get it started at lower turmoil.",

Second, we provided computational evidence that the dilemma of cooperation can be solved without complicated and costly mechanisms such as reputations, selective incentives and rationality. Third, we showed which networks are most conductive to cooperation under high uncertainty. Future studies could confront the model with empirical data, perhaps even of different species, for example buffalo herd bulls who chase a lion together [7] . One could also investigate more systematically the numbers of necessary Monte Carlo steps for different networks and distributions of S 0 .",

Accordingly, the values chosen in our examples imply S 0 = 0.25 and \u0394 = 0.75.",
