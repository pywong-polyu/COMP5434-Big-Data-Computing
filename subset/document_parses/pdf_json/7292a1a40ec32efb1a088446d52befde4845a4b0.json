Novel third-generation sequencing platforms offer an extended read length and promise to resolve how distant polymorphic sites along individual genomes are linked. In the present study, we established a long amplicon PacBio sequencing workflow to identify the absolute and relative quantities of unique HCMV haplotypes spanning over multiple hypervariable sites in mixtures. Initial validation of this approach was performed with defined HCMV DNA templates derived from cell-culture enriched viruses and was further tested for its suitability on patient samples carrying mixed HCMV infections.",

Artificial HCMV DNA mixtures were correctly determined down to 1% abundance of the minor DNA source when the total HCMV DNA input was 4 \u00d7 10 4 copies/ml. PCR products of up to 7.7 kb and a GC content < 55% were efficiently generated when DNA was directly isolated from patient samples. In a single sample, up to three distinct haplotypes were identified showing varying relative frequencies. Alignments of distinct haplotype sequences within patient samples showed uneven distribution of sequence diversity, interspersed by long identical stretches. Moreover, diversity estimation at single polymorphic regions as assessed by short amplicon sequencing may markedly underestimate the overall diversity of mixed haplotype populations.",

Individual polymorphic sites within the HCMV genome, either comprising a complete gene or a highly variable section thereof, have been widely investigated with first and second generation short read sequencing [16, 17] . These investigations uniformly show that almost all polymorphic regions cluster into defined genotypes [18, 19] . This allows assignment of even short sequence reads to reference genotype sequences by the use of genotype-defining signature sequence patterns of the respective polymorphic regions [10, 19, 20] . In recent years, widely used in-depth short read sequencing of the whole genome comprehensively assessed genome-wide intra-and inter-host diversity at the nucleotide level, and intrahost variability over time [18, 19, [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] . Moreover, these studies revealed that recombination between and within polymorphic regions of different HCMV strains have been common and single nucleotide variants that may emerge during replication periods will further contribute to the overall strain diversity. Accordingly, it appears that a huge variety of different HCMV strains circulate in the human population and the frequency of occurrence of completely identical \"strain genotypes\" among HCMV-infected persons seems to be very rare [19] .",

Total DNA was directly isolated from HFFs infected with HCMV strain TB40-BAC4-luc or Merlin and used either as PCR template (amplicons) or directly without any further enrichment (non-enriched) before sequencing. After demultiplexing, circular consensus sequencing reads (ccs) for each forward and reverse strand were generated to prevent incorrect analysis due to heteroduplexes. Resulting ccs reads per sample showed an average length of 3583 to 6162 bases (Table 2 ). For comparison of PacBio with Illumina sequencing quality filtering was similarly performed for both, Illumina-derived (Supplementary Table 5 ) and PacBio-derived reads. Quality trimming, which was performed with a base-calling error probability (pError) of 0.01 (equals Q > 20) and 0.001 (equals Q > 30), respectively, resulted in a substantial reduction in read length. This reduction was even more pronounced when raw reads were trimmed to Q > 30. Remarkably, up to 19% of all reads had a length < 500 bases when quality trimmed to Q > 20, and up to 37% when quality trimmed to Q > 30. Thus, for subsequent mapping all reads \u2264500 bases were excluded after removal of human-specific DNA reads. Host read removal led to a reduction of up to 56% of reads for amplicon samples and up to 95% for non-enriched samples ( Table 2) . HCMV-specific mapping rates were \u2265 85% for non-enriched samples and \u2265 95% for amplicons. Illumina-derived reads were similarly analysed, except for length trimming of reads < 500 bases (Supplementary Table 5 ). In the top track, a mini-map of the genome with a total bases of 235,646 is shown. Annotated CDS and non-coding RNAs are depicted in grey and black, respectively. Target regions for amplicon generation are depicted in red and are described in detail in track 2-4. For track 2, defined polymorphic regions were put through a blastn search. Over 200 published haplotypes for the described regions were aligned. The mean pairwise identity over all pairs in the column is depicted. Green: 100% identity, greenish-brown: at least 30% identity but less than 100%, red: less than 30%. Displayed above the sequences (3rd track), grey and black arrows again represent CDS and non-coding RNAs, respectively. Forward and reverse primer (red and blue) are depicted below the sequence. The bottom track indicates individual fragment sizes and GC content of eight polymorphic target regions. Annotations were generated with geneious prime 2019.0.3 The error rate was estimated from mapped reads either quality trimmed with pError of 0.01 or 0.001. A comparison between non-enriched and amplicon-enriched DNA allowed us to specifically determine the error rates introduced by long range PCR. Substitutions, deletions, and insertions relative to the reference sequence were counted and the percentage of mismatches out of the total number of matched bases was calculated. As shown in Table 3 , PacBio sequencing displays a 5.5-fold to 9.5-fold (pError 0.01 and 0.001, respectively) higher substitution error rate for PCR-enriched compared to non-enriched DNA. Indel errors are similarly high in both sample types. Notably, more stringent quality trimming parameters have almost no effect on substitution errors, but can substantially reduce indels. Moreover, insertions are ~ 2.0 to 5.0-fold more frequently found than deletions. Taken together, these data show that substitutions are mainly introduced by PCR whereas deletions and insertions mainly result from sequencing. No difference was seen between the two template DNAs, TB40-BAC4-luc and Merlin, and between the distinct target regions for PCR enrichment (Supplementary Table 8 ).",

Figure 3 displays the intra-and interpatient diversity of HCMV haplotypes determined by PacBio long amplicon sequencing. We observe no clustering between individual haplotypes of the same patients. Samples with the same genotypes identified by short amplicon Illumina sequencing can still be phylogenetically distant on a haplotype scale (e.g. BAL2_F4_hap1 and BAL2_F4_hap2). When both trees are compared, no consistent phylogenetic clustering pattern between the two non-neighbouring loci (F3, F4) is observed suggesting that there are no linkages between individual haplotypes of different regions. The overall nucleotide diversity (p-distance) for F3 sequences was 0.045 (range: 0.001 to 0.062) and for F4 was 0.07 (range: 0.034 to 0.099). Sequence comparison of the patient's haplotype population shows that two sequences can be identical over more than 200 bases and longer stretches of similarity often differ only by a few SNVs (Fig. 2 ). This clearly indicates that short reads are often not long enough to cover non-adjacent diversity. Of note, for all haplotype sequences similar sequences (> 97%) were found in the NCBI Nucleotide (nr/nt) database ( Table 5) .",

In BAL4 and BAL6, a higher number of genotypes than haplotypes was detected. These results indicate that low level HCMV DNA sequences are still amplifiable by short range PCR but not by long range PCR. Remarkably, in BAL2 a higher number of haplotypes than genotypes was found. Further inspection of all sequences over the gN, gO, and UL146 region revealed that two distinct F3 haplotype sequences share the same gN3b and gO2a genotype, and two distinct F4 haplotype sequences share the same UL146-13 genotype (Table 5) . These shared genotypes, however, vary by a few SNVs. In Fig. 4 , the data for the two gN3b variants are displayed. Precisely, the two gN3b variants of the respective haplotypes differ by 3 SNVs (p-distance 0.008) over the genotype-defining region whereas the p-distance over the complete F3 amplicon length was 0.026. Further sequence alignments of PacBio and Illumina reads for BAL2 gN and UL146 are provided in Supplementary Figs. 1 and 2 . These findings impressively demonstrate the information benefit of long amplicon over short amplicon sequencing. Additionally, BAL4_F4_hap1 was found to have a 1 bp insertion in a homopolymeric region when compared with the Illumina reads ( Supplementary Fig. 3 ). As our error estimation analysis shows, PacBio sequencing has a higher indel error rate compared to Illumina sequencing (Table 3 ). These calculations suggest that the insertion might have been introduced as a sequencing error. Nevertheless, as of this state, it is not possible to reliably determine which of the two homopolymeric sequences is correct. This observed discrepancy illustrates that both sequencing techniques can complement each other and improve data certainty. ",

We tested the amplification of 8 HCMV specific target regions, with sizes from 6.7 to 18 kb and observed substantial variations in performance even when highly purified low fragmented HCMV DNA (BAC) was used as template. Irrespective of the average GC content target regions which comprise a GC content of 72% over a 1 kb segment (fragments F2, F2.2, and F1.2) were especially difficult to amplify. Hence, for GC rich regions alternative target enrichment techniques such as solution-based capture [22, 32, 33] and molecular inversion probes [34] might be considered. The enzyme with the best performance was picked out for further optimisation of PCR conditions for the three target regions, F1, F3, and F4, (all < 8 kb) using HCMV DNA isolated from cell culture supernatant. In addition to genome specific limitations, successful amplification of long range amplicons depends on the Fig. 4 Nucleotide variation between genotype and haplotype sequences of region gN. A depiction of the polymorphic region F3 (7.7 kb) can be seen on the top. While annotated CDS are depicted with grey arrows, genotypes gN (UL73) and gO (UL74), for short read sequencing, can be seen in dark blue.

Moreover, it has been reported that PacBio long read sequencing is associated with a higher error rate than short read sequencing techniques [37] . In order to precisely define the substitution and indel error rate of long amplicon sequencing, we compared PCR-enriched with non-enriched cell culture-derived samples. Although we observed a substantial reduction in the overall number of reads (25 to 54%) and in the average read length (42 to 72%) depending on the stringency of quality trimming parameters, this was similar for both sample types. Substitution errors, in contrast, were found to be 6-fold to 9-fold higher in amplicons compared to non-enriched samples, yet without any influence of the stringency of quality trimming. These findings suggest that substitution errors are largely introduced by PCR which is well in accordance with previous reports [36] . Overall substitution error rate was about 0.08% which means that low-level single nucleotide variants (SNV) down to 1% could be well distinguishable from PCRmediated substitutions. SNVs lower than 1%, however, may require additional steps for validation such as performance in duplicates. The number of indels was similar for non-enriched and amplicon-enriched samples indicating introduction by long read sequencing rather than by PCR. For non-ambiguous determination of true insertions and/or deletions either reanalysis with highly quality trimmed reads or an additional short read Illumina sequencing, which shows a very low indel error rate, could be performed. Alternatively, high coverage ccs can be aimed for in order to decrease the error rate down to ~ 0.001% [38] . As can also be seen within our haplotypes, indels are usually the second most abundant form of genetic variation. The reliable detection of indels is still a challenging problem, as our understanding of their origins and functional effects lags behind that of other types of variants. Indels have the potential to generate great changes in a viral population, as truncated or extended genes can be created through frameshifts or by the removal of stop codons. Overall, indels contribute to genetic variation in a virus genome. Within our haplotypes in the subset of samples we did not observe additional stop codons or significant changes in gene length.",

First, our findings indicate a potentially higher detection rate of low abundance populations by short amplicon compared to long amplicon sequencing as observed in two samples. Since short range PCRs usually show a higher sensitivity and are less prone to fragmented DNA found in patient samples, low abundance templates are easier to amplify. This makes this genotyping approach particularly suitable for initial screening of mixed infections. Second, short amplicon genotyping may strongly underestimate the intra-host diversity.",

            "text": "Our data show that individual haplotypes can carry the same genotype sequences across the respective target region but are otherwise substantially diverse. Moreover, SNVs of the same genotype which can be detected by short amplicon sequencing will not represent the overall haplotype diversity. Third, intra-host haplotype sequences show stretches of identity interspersed by diverse sections. This observation underlines the usefulness of long sequencing reads to identify co-linearity of multiple polymorphic regions of individual haplotype sequences which could not be assessed by short reads. Third generation long read sequencing platforms, such as SMRT sequencing from PacBio and Nanopore sequencing from Oxford Nanopore Technologies open this possibility due to its extended read length [28, 29] .",

This strategy for haplotype determination allows linkage analysis of multiple non-adjacent polymorphic sites along up to 7.7 kb. This allows a better approximation to the true strain diversity in mixed samples, which short read sequencing approaches failed to do. Taken together, this study provides the basis of a novel HCMV genome characterization strategy which will lead to an improved understanding of intra-host diversity and the dynamics of mixed HCMV strain populations.

For this, F3 amplicon-derived reads below 7500 and above 8000 and F4 amplicon-derived reads below 6500 and above 7000 number of nucleotides in reads were excluded. Remaining reads were processed with following parameters: quality trimming with a base-calling error probability of 0.01, ambiguous limit of 2 in a read and exclusion of low quality reads. Only reads that span more than half of the amplicon length (4000 nucleotides for F3-and 3500 nucleotides for F4-derived amplicons) were retained and human genomic DNA reads removed. Remaining reads were mapped to 236 HCMV full genomes (Supplementary Table 7) , with default setting parameters for match/mismatch scores and insertion/deletion costs, length fraction of 0.7, and similarity fraction of 0.8 and non-specific mappings were ignored. Consensus sequences were generated from mappings with a consensus length of > 6.9 kb for F3-and > 5.9 kb for F4-derived amplicons, and with a minimum coverage of > 0.1% of the average coverage ( Supplementary Tables 12a and 12b ). Extracted consensus sequences were aligned by muscle [42] and visually inspected in BioEdit 7.2.5 (Ibis Therapeutics). Unique consensus sequences were used as new reference sequences to repeat the mapping with length and similarity fraction of 0.9. New consensus sequences from mappings spanning over the complete amplicon length showing a uniform coverage were extracted. Ambiguity codes were inserted using a noise threshold of 0.1 and a minimum nucleotide count of 5. Unmapped reads were further mapped to human and HCMV genomes to confirm that no haplotype sequences got lost during the analysis steps. After alignment and visual inspection unique consensus sequences were counted as independent haplotypes. To visualise the diversity among distinct haplotypes, nucleotide alignments and phylogenetic tree analysis of all haplotypes were performed in Geneious Prime \u00ae 2019.0.3 and Mega 7.0.14 [43] , respectively. Phylogenetic trees were inferred by using the Maximum Likelihood method based on the HKY + G (0.05) + I (0,27) for F3 haplotypes and Kimura-2 + G (0,47) + I (0,62) for F4 haplotypes. Best fit substitution model (lowest BIC score) was assessed with Mega 7.0.14.",
