Therefore, we conducted a multicenter prospective cohort study looking at the outcomes of 40 MS patients with confirmed COVID-19. Severity of COVID-19 infection was based on hospital course, where a mild course was defined as the patient not requiring hospital admission, moderate severity was defined as the patient requiring hospital admission to the general floor, and most severe was defined as requiring intensive care unit admission and/or death. 19/40(47.5%) had mild courses, 15/40(37.5%) had moderate courses, and 6/40(15%) had severe courses. Patients with moderate and severe courses were significantly older than those with a mild course (57[50-63] years old and 66[58.8-69.5] years old vs 48[40-51.5] years old, P = 0.0121, P = 0.0373). There was differing prevalence of progressive MS phenotype in those with more severe courses (severe:2/6[33.3%]primary-progressing and 0/6[0%]secondaryprogressing, moderate:1/14[7.14%] and 5/14[35.7%] vs mild:0/19[0%] and 1/19[5.",

Diseasemodifying therapy prevalence did not differ among courses (mild:17/19[89.5%], moderate:12/15[80%] and severe:3/6[50%], P = 0.123). MS patients with more severe COVID-19 courses tended to be older, were more likely to suffer from progressive phenotype, and had a higher degree of disability.

In fact, it appears that more patients with moderate and severe courses were not on any DMT compared to those with mild courses. DMTs have been hypothesized to attenuate the cytokine-storm response in COVID-19, though this is still purely speculative [14] . In fact, Louapre et al. found that there were higher proportions of severe COVID-19 cases in MS patients that were not receiving DMTs [15] . Nonetheless, usage of DMTs do not necessarily appear to be associated with more severe COVID-19-courses. These findings correspond to those in ongoing North American COVID-19 MS survey database (covims.org) and Italian cohort surveyed by Sormani el al. where patients who died tended to be older, have PPMS or SPMS, and have significant disability and comorbidities, but were less likely to be on DMT [3, 16] .",

Our cohort did not show any statistically significant difference in terms of MS characteristics and outcomes based on race, however it appears that patients with more severe courses tended to be African American. This may be due to significant socioeconomic disadvantages and higher prevalence of comorbidities (i.e hypertension, diabetes) among African Americans, however our cohort was small and more studies are required to investigate this racial disparity [19] .",

Larger studies are therefore required in order to correct for potential confounding variables. Also, there was a significant discrepancy in sample-size for each course, as there were only 6 patients with severe disease course. Therefore, significant differences may not have been detected in post hoc comparisons and only very strong factors were found to be associated with disease outcomes. Regardless, we showed that certain MS-characteristics were more frequent in those with more severe COVID-19 courses.",
