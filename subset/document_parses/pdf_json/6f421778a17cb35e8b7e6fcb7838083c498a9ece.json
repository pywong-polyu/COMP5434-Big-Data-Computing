Current polio vaccines take two forms-live-attenuated oral polio virus (OPV) and inactivated polio virus (IPV) [2] . OPV advantages include low cost, ease of administration and ability to induce both mucosal and humoral immunity. However, OPV has the disadvantages that it is heavily reliant on the cold chain for retention of vaccine potency and OPV has the propensity to revert to wildtype and cause vaccine-derived poliomyelitis [3] . IPV is much safer as it cannot cause poliomyelitis, but its disadvantages include weak immunogenicity and the need for multiple booster injections, together with high manufacturing costs [4, 5] . There is therefore a pressing need to develop more immunogenic and cost-effective IPV vaccines to replace OPV vaccines in global polio eradication programs.",

Current IPV vaccines induce 90% protection against all three serotypes after two doses, and 99% after three doses [8] . Current IPV vaccines, whilst effective, could be improved in a number of ways. Notably, the level and duration of protective immunity could be enhanced, reducing the number of booster doses required for protection of infants. Increased immunogenicity could also allow antigen dose sparing, thereby reducing its cost. Although IPV vaccines currently do not contain adjuvant, animal studies have shown the feasibility of using various adjuvants including MF59, calcium, aluminum hydroxide, vitamin D and TLR9active cytosine-phosphodiester-guanosine (CpG)-motif containing oligonucleotides in IPV vaccines [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] . However, most of these studies only evaluated adjuvants with the IPV in their monovalent form and not formulated as TIPV, limiting the interpretation of such results. However, these studies do support the potential benefit of adjuvants for enhancing IPV immunogenicity and for antigen dose-sparing.",

When used in the immunization of pregnant mothers and newborns, Advax adjuvant was safe and well tolerated and enhanced immunogenicity despite pregnancy-associated immunosuppression or neonatal immune immaturity [21] [22] [23] . The immunogenicity of Advax adjuvant was further extended with the addition of TLR9active CpG oligonucleotides to the formulation to create Advax-CpG adjuvant, with the CpG oligonucleotide helping to drive a strong Th1 vaccine response [24] and acting synergistically with Advax to enhance vaccine immunogenicity [25] [26] [27] [28] .

Sera were collected at weeks 2, 4, 9, 13, 26, 30, 35 and 44 after the first immunization for measurement of antibody levels and neutralization activity. For studies with the SSI TIPV vaccine, female BALB/c mice (n = 9/group) received two i.m. immunizations into the hind thigh 3 weeks apart with SSI TIPV vaccine (10 DU type adjusted by dilution with saline for injection1, 2 DU type 2 and 9 DU type 3) alone or formulated with Advax (1 mg) with or without CpG (10 \u00b5g). An addition group was set up to test monovalent forms of the IPV vaccine at three different doses (10, 1 and 0.1 DU, DU adjusted by dilution with saline) alone or formulated with Advax-CpG or CpG adjuvant alone. Sera were collected at weeks 2, 5, 13, 26, 39 and 52 after the first immunization for measurement of antibody levels and neutralization activity. For rat studies with the SSI TIPV vaccine, female Wistar rats (n = 3/group) were immunized i.m. twice (0.2 mL per mouse) 3 weeks apart with SSI TIPV (10 DU type IP1, 2 DU type IP2 and 9 DU type IP3, DU adjusted by dilution with saline) alone or formulated with Advax (2 mg) and/or CpG (20 \u00b5g). Blood samples were collected at weeks 2 and 4 for measurement of antibodies and neutralization activity. ",

            "text": "As an initial first step, we assessed the ability of Advax-CpG adjuvant to enhance the antibody responses to a commercial human TIPV vaccine, IPOL \u00ae (Sanofi, Swiftwater, PA, USA). To mimic the manufacturer's recommended vaccine schedule in human babies, BALB/c mice were immunized with four doses of IPOL \u00ae vaccine at weeks 0, 3, 7 and 12 with IPOL \u00ae alone or formulated with Advax or Advax-CpG adjuvant. While ELISAs could be performed on individual mice samples, due to larger sera requirements for the neutralization titer (NT) assays, these were unable to be performed on individual mice, with sera from each member of a group being assembled into a single pooled sample to run the NT assay. Overall, unadjuvanted IPOL \u00ae vaccine had low immunogenicity after administration of two consecutive 0.1 mL doses, with NT on the pooled group sera of 36, 113.7, and 5.6 for IPV1, IPV2 and IPV3, respectively ( Figure 1A ). By contrast, when the IPOL \u00ae vaccine was formulated with Advax-CpG adjuvant, the NT for each of the three IPV antigens were markedly boosted in the pooled sera from each group, achieving NT > 1:1024 against each of the three IPV strains ( Figure 1A ). While the use of pooled group samples precluded the use of statistics to compare groups, the 10-200-fold higher NT for each serotype in the adjuvanted groups clearly demonstrated a major effect of the adjuvants, and this was further supported by the ELISA data on individual mice. We then boosted the mice with two additional higher doses of the IPOL \u00ae vaccine (triple-dose-0.3 mL equivalent) at weeks 12 and 14 to see whether this could boost the low titers induced by the IPOL \u00ae vaccine alone and then followed the resulting antibody titers for a total of 52 weeks. Notably, even after a total of four doses including two triple-dose boosters, the commercial IPOL \u00ae vaccine was, by itself, unable to match titers achieved after just two standard doses of IPOL \u00ae combined with Advax or Advax-CpG adjuvants. IPV3 neutralization antibody titers, in particular, remained significantly low even after four doses of unadjuvanted IPOL \u00ae vaccine. By contrast, high neutralization titers to IPV1, IPV2 and IPV3 were achieved in the Advax and Advax-CpG adjuvated vaccine groups with titers remaining above levels predicted to be protective (titer of 1:8) all the way to study termination at 52 weeks post-immunization. Due to insufficient sera being available to run NT assays on individual mice, sera from each members of a group were assembled into a single pooled sample to run the NT assay, resulting in a single result for each serotype (A). Typespecific antibodies were determined by ELISA and OD values are shown as mean \u00b1 SD (B-D). The significance for ELISA results was analyzed by one-way ANOVA with the Kruskal-Wallis test and was indicated as * p < 0.05. Arrows indicate the immunization timing.

Th1 cells produce proinflammatory cytokines, such as INF-\u03b3, that enhance cellular immune response effective against intracellular pathogens, such as polio virus, whilst Th2 cells predominately produce cytokines, such as IL-4, that boost antibody production [31] . Antibody subclasses are governed by the balance of cytokines produced by Th1 and Th2 cells, with IL-4 promoting the production of IgG1, whilst IFN-\u03b3 enhances the production of IgG2 subtypes [32] . The Advax-CpG-driven Th1 response, as reflected by high IgG2 production, is consistent with the literature in showing that CpG oligonucleotides induce Th1 immunity [24] . This Th1 bias of Advax-CpG adjuvant may help to reduce the risk of vaccine allergic sensitization. For example, Advax-CpG adjuvant prevented eosinophilic lung immunopathology caused by inactivated SARS coronavirus vaccine [27] . Yang et al. [13] demonstrated that CpG formulated with alum enhanced the immunogenicity and provided 4-16-fold dose sparing for a Sabin poliovirus vaccine although, a major limitation was that the IPV antigens were only evaluated in monovalent form. While other studies have reported that CpG adjuvants can cause local reactions [33] , no local or systemic reactogenicity was observed in the immunized mice or rats in the current study. The lack of reactogenicity or pyrogenicity in the Advax-CpG may be attributed to the unique anti-inflammatory properties of Advax [14] .",

Unlike the IPOL \u00ae TIPV, the SSI TIPV vaccine appeared to have a major inbuilt Th1 bias, as reflected by predominant IgG2a/b antibody induction even when administered without adjuvant. While protective levels of type 2 and 3 neutralization activity persisted long-term (>1 year), type 1 neutralization titers remained below protective levels. Similar results were seen in rats immunized with SSI TIPV, although in that case the low type 1 neutralization titer was overcome to an extent by the addition of Advax-CpG adjuvant. Immunization of mice with type 1 monovalent antigen formulated with Advax-CpG enhanced neutralization titers compared to the same antigen dose in the TIPV formulation. Thus, these data suggest that when the three SSI antigens are formulated together as TIPV, there might be an antigenic competition which then preferences B cell responses to type 2 and 3 antigens over type 1. Antigenic competition is not an uncommon problem in multivalent vaccines, particularly where the antigens are closely related. A previous study evaluating the SSI TIPV vaccine similarly reported lower type 1 titers neutralization in microneutralization assays run by the Centre for Disease Control laboratory when compared to type 2 and 3 run in their inhouse assays, suggesting possible differences in assay protocols or antigens [34] . As Advax-CpG had a dose-sparing effect on type 2 and 3 antigens inducing very high antibody titers to these antigens, future studies could examine whether reducing the dose of type 2 and 3 antigens in the TIPV formulation could overcome type 1 antigen competition.",

In particular, the SSI IPV antigens appeared to have a major inbuilt Th1 bias, as reflected by predominant IgG2a/b antibody response even when the antigens were administered without adjuvant. By contrast, the Sanofi commercial TIPV vaccine induced almost exclusively IgG1 antibodies when given without adjuvant. One explanation for SSI antigens to have a high Th1 bias would be if it contained residual nucleic acids after inactivation which are thereby able to bind to TLRs and induce innate immune activation, thereby behaving like an inbuilt adjuvant. This was also seen in the recent Dietrich et al. [34] paper where in fact they saw no IgG1 production in response to the TIPV antigen either alone or combined with CAF01 adjuvant, but instead only detected IgG2a/c and IgG2b, suggesting an Th1-bias of the IPV antigens. Such an intrinsic adjuvant effect could mask the full benefits of added adjuvants. Whilst some residual nucleic acids may assist a vaccine by acting as adjuvants, they could also be a major cause of reactogenicity. For example, an Australian pediatric seasonal influenza vaccine had to be withdrawn from the market after causing febrile convulsions in children, a problem identified to be due to unusually high levels of residual nucleic acids due to inadequate splitting of the beta-propiolactone inactivated virus particles [35, 36] . IPV, like seasonal influenza vaccine, is based on an inactivated RNA virus and hence high Th1 activity of IPV antigens may predict excess reactogenicity and potential to cause fevers in very young children, something that will need to be carefully monitored.",

The results to date indicate that antigen absorption and depot formation is not required for Advax adjuvant action, with an adjuvant effect observed even when Advax was injected 24 h in advance of the antigen, but not when injected 24 h after the antigen [19] . An extensive monocytic cell infiltrate is observed at the muscle site within 24-48 h of Advax injection indicating that it has major chemotactic effects, and recruited mononuclear cells exhibit upregulation of co-stimulatory molecules including major histocompatibility molecules, CD11c and CD86, but not inflammatory cytokine production, suggesting its major action is on regulation of antigen presenting cell function. Human subjects immunized with Advax-adjuvanted trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine demonstrated an enhanced day 7 post-immunization plasmablast response, with the plasmablasts showing greater frequency of non-silent mutations in the B-cell-receptor CDR3 sequence together with higher levels of activation-induced cytidine deaminase [37] . This supports the idea that Advax adjuvant enhances B cell affinity maturation, which we hypothesize is via an effect to enhance the action of T follicular helper T cells. Hence, delta inulin-based adjuvants particularly when co-formulated with a TLR9 active CpG oligonucleotide potently enhance vaccine immunogenicity and may be useful for antigensparing for TIPV vaccines being used in global eradication campaigns.",
