This has increased the workload on radiologists, and a number of cases are in backlog. This is not only the case for COVID-19, but for the other abnormalities needing radiological diagnosis as well. In this work, we present an automated technique for rapid diagnosis of COVID-19 on computed tomography images. The proposed technique consists of four primary steps: (1) data collection and normalization, (2) extraction of the relevant features, (3) selection of the most optimal features and (4) feature classification. In the data collection step, we collect data for several patients from a public domain website, and perform preprocessing, which includes image resizing. In the successive step, we apply discrete wavelet transform and extended segmentation-based fractal texture analysis methods for extracting the relevant features. This is followed by application of an entropy controlled genetic algorithm for selection of the best features from each feature type, which are combined using a serial approach. In the final phase, the best features are subjected to various classifiers for the diagnosis. The proposed framework, when augmented with the Naive Bayes classifier, yields the best accuracy of 92.6%. The simulation results are supported by a detailed statistical analysis as a proof of concept.",

            "text": "Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is highly contagious and has rapidly spread globally infecting almost all the countries with millions of positive cases and more than 0.4 million deaths [1] , and is continuously on the rise; see Table 1 and Figs. 1 and 2. The key factor to limit this pandemic situation is the early testing and diagnosis. However, due to its pandemic nature, quick collection and testing of samples from the suspected patients is a challenging issue for clinical management. Its early detection is possible with Nucleic Acid Amplification Tests (NAAT), such as reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) [2] , which is required to be interpreted by trained clinical laboratory personnel [3] . The initial symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, fatigue and dry cough, and it predominantly affects lungs. The affected lobes with ground glass changes and/or consolidations etc. can be recorded in chest radiology images [4, 5] . This is why the clinicians worldwide are using chest X-rays (CXR) and computed tomography (CT) images as an alternative and fast method for the screening the cases of breast screening [22] , diagnosis and quantification of emphysema severity [23] , tuberculosis detection [24] and claims of detection of diagnosis idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis with similar accuracy to a human reader [25] . During the past year, several imaging-based diagnosis techniques of COVID-19 backed by AI and machine learning have been presented, along with their correlation with the RT-PCR [26, 27] . CT and CXR images are processed for the detection of pneumonia like imaging features using AI techniques. In [28] , CXR images and deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are used to diagnose COVID-19. The models used are ResNet 50, Inception V3 and a hybrid approach based on Inception-ResNetV2, claiming accuracies of 98%, 97% and 87% , respectively. In another approach [29] , COVID-19 and bacterial and viral pneumonia are diagnosed and classified into negative or positive by using X-ray radiographs. The approach makes use of GoogleNet as a deep transfer model, claiming 100% accuracy. In another approach [30] , the authors have claimed 86.7% accuracy in diagnosing the early signs of COVID-19, using chest CT images with deep learning . Authors in [31] propose to use twodimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) deep learning models combination and claim an accuracy of 98.2% and specificity of 92.2% with chest CT images. In [32] , the authors combined the Inception CNN with Marine Predators algorithm to select the most relevant features from COVID-19 X-ray images, achieving an accuracy of 98.7%. In another study, the deep learning methods are used to extract COVID-19 graphical features and provide clinical diagnosis quite ahead of the pathogenic test helping in timely control of the spread. The authors claim a rather constrained accuracy of 85.2% [10] .",

Furthermore, these systems normally give binary decision of either negative or positive, and do not incorporate any qualitative analyses based on the recommendations of Radiological Society of North America (RSNA) [33, 34] . Hence, it may be concluded that most of the available methods are either not sufficiently reliable, or achieve a constrained diagnosis efficiency. Especially for contagious diseases, such as COVID-19, there is still space for a thorough framework that could address the aforementioned discrepancies.",

Some studies have shown that imaging should be discouraged as primary screening tool, because these may suffer from selection bias (from inter observer variability among radiologists) with the claims that it is ten times less sensitive and less specific as compared to RT-PCR [35] . This implies that it can be negative in the early stages of the disease, and imaging features can overlap with many other infectious and noninfectious disease processes. However, in China, the chest CT has proven to have relatively higher sensitivity for COVID-19 as compared to the initial RT-PCR from swab samples [27] , possibly due to the high sensitivity of CT images to lung lesion even before RT-PCR [36, 37] . As the RT-PCR takes more time, that is at least 6 h, imaging was a much faster and readily available screening tool in the surge of patients during the pandemic situation especially where RT-PCR were not available; therefore, it has played an important role in the risk stratification and screening for COVID -19. Chest radiographs are less sensitive as compared to chest CT and can give negative diagnose in case of early or mild infection, but can be used as a first line imaging modality [38] . On CXR, the findings may be airspace opacities or Ground Glass Opacities (GGO) mostly distributed in bilateral, peripheral and lower zone [38, 39] .",

It is important to note that many respiratory viruses, such as influenza, organizing pneumonia and connective tissue disorders, can cause pneumonia like changes on both chest radiograph and CT similar to that of COVID-19, and therefore, their proper interpretation and differentiation from COVID-19 is a challenging issue [40, 41] .

The whole idea revolves around the fundamental property of the feature randomness calculated by the entropy function. More the entropy value is, greater the chances of a healthy chromosome. Here, the entropy calculator identifies the maximum randomness by controlling the uncertainty. For a real-valued chromosome vector C 1 j = {(G 1 1 , G 1 2 , G 1 3 , \u2026 , G 1 m )} , the Shannon entropy is calculated using the relation:",

The experimental process is performed on the collected COVID-19 positive and healthy samples and shows the proposed method to be effective. The main contribution of this work is an optimized genetic algorithm for best selection. Using this algorithm, the accuracy of individual feature type is improved and when all selected features are combined, then a significant change has been observed in the accuracy. Based on the performance of this algorithm, we concluded that the selection of most relevant features improves the accuracy, but on the other side, it is a high chance that we miss the important features that play a contribution in the improvement of prediction accuracy.
