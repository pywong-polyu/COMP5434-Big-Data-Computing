We use March 13, 2020, when President Trump declared a national state of emergency as a time anchor to define the pre-pandemic and on-pandemic periods. The pre-pandemic experiment was conducted on February 21, 2020. There are three on-pandemic rounds conducted 10 days, 15 days, and 20 days after the COVID-19 emergency declaration. We include four different risk-preference measures. Men are more sensitive to the pandemic and become more risk-averse based on the Balloon Analogue Risk Task (BART). Women become more risk-averse in the Social and Experience Seeking domains based on the results from the Domain-Specific Risk-Taking (DOSPERT) and Sensation Seeking Scales (SSS). Both men's and women's risk-preference are stable during COVID-19 based on a Gamble Choice (GC) task. The results match our hypotheses which are based on the discussion about whether the psychological construct of risk-preference is general or domain-specific. The differential outcomes between incentivized behavioral and self-reported propensity measures of risk-preference in our experiment show the caveats for studies using a single measure to test risk-preference changes during COVID-19.",

            "text": "Based on classical economic theories, preferences (including risk preferences) are stable and unaffected by experience over time (Stigler and Becker, 1977) . However, evidence from empirical studies shows that people's risk attitudes can be affected by negative shocks (Bogliacino et al., 2021) , such as natural disasters (Eckel et al., 2009; Page et al., 2014; Hanaoka et al., 2018; Kahsay and Osberghaus, 2018; Abatayo and Lynham, 2020) , financial crisis (Jetter et al., 2020) , and violent events (Callen et al., 2014; Jakiela and Ozier, 2019) . COVID-19 has affected the global economy substantially. Many people lost their jobs and business during COVID-19 (Kawohl and Nordt, 2020) . Thus, COVID-19 may change the background risk for people by changing the living and working environment and bringing more uncertainties to the life (Gollier and Pratt, 1996; Quiggin, 2003; Guiso and Paiella, 2008) . The change in background risk may bring changes in the risk-taking behavior of people (Eeckhoudt et al., 1996; Tsetlin and Winkler, 2005; Lee, 2008) . More recently and related to this article, studies on risk-preference comparisons between pre-COVID-19 and on-COVID-19 show mixed results. Angrisani et al. (2020) , Lohmann et al. (2020) , and Drichoutis and Nayga (2021) find no significant change in risk preferences during COVID-19; Gassmann et al. (2020) and Shachat et al. (2021b) suggest less risk aversion or increased risk tolerance during COVID-19; the results from Harrison et al. (2020) and Li et al. (2021) , however, exhibit more risk aversion of subjects under COVID-19; Shachat et al. (2021a) find decreased risk tolerance in the loss domain and less risk aversion in the gain domain. All of these studies use only one (type) measurement of risk-preference, and they all use experiments conducted in 2019 as a pre-pandemic baseline. The subjects are all students.",

(2002) , the Gamble Choice (GC) developed by Eckel and Grossman (2008) , Domain-Specific Risk-Taking (DOSPERT) developed by Blais and Weber (2006) , and Sensation Seeking Scale (SSS) developed by Zuckerman et al. (1964) . BART and GC are incentivized behavioral measures, and DOSPERT and SSS are self-reported propensity measures. Frey et al. (2017) found a substantial gap between revealed risk-preference by behavioral measures and stated risk-preference by self-reported measures. Frey et al. (2017) acknowledge that the vast majority of past empirical work on risk-preference has typically used single measures of risk-preference, and suggest that using several instruments to measure risk-reference may reduce measurement error for future empirical work.",

            "text": "Second, we believe the timeline of our study can reflect the most immediate and salient changes in risk preferences by the COVID-19 shock. We implemented an online experiment to verify the robustness of Zhang and Palma (2021) on February 21, 2020, that serves as a baseline (pre-pandemic) 1 . The experiment was about risk-taking behavior with insurance, and it consists of the four risk-preference elicitation methods mentioned above. On March 13, 2020, President Trump declared a national state of emergency. We use March 13, as a time anchor and implemented three rounds of parallel experiments conducted online on March 23, 2020, March 28, 2020, and April 2, 2020, respectively. The three dates were selected to be 10, 15, and 20 days after the state of emergency declaration. Note that on February 21, the effects of COVID-19 had not yet spread widely in the United States, and there were only 19 daily confirmed cases based on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) data tracker. Starting March 13, the number of COVID-19 cases in the U.S. increased exponentially. The new daily confirmed cases on our on-pandemic rounds are 11,400, 20,820, 30,157, respectively (refer to Appendix 7 for the trend of daily cases from February 21 to April 2). We argue that the rounds of our experiment reflect the pre and on-pandemic times. Third, we implement an online experiment with more a general population than students as subjects. All four rounds were conducted using Amazon Mturk. The average age of subjects in our experiment is 41, and all subjects are located in the United States. Subjects of the pre and on-pandemic are from the same population. We do not find significant differences in demographic characteristics between pre and on-pandemic rounds, except that there are only marginal significant differences in age and household size (refer to Appendix 8). In regressions in the result section, we control for those demographic variables.",

The main measurement used to assess risk-taking behavior was the BART. We also included three other risk preferences elicitation methods to validate BART as a measurement of risk-taking behavior. The original experiment contains three treatments varying in the insurance types set in BART. For the pre-pandemic round on February 21, 2020, we implemented the entire original experiment with three treatments; we only ran the \"Voluntary Insurance\" treatment for the other three on-pandemic rounds. The reason is that the focus of this article is risk-preference changes instead of insurance. For the on-pandemic rounds, we added a question at the end of the experiment about whether participants were in self-isolation or not. Around 81% of subjects answered \"Yes.\" This to some extent confirms that our subjects were experiencing COVID-19 impacts when they were participating in our on-pandemic rounds.",

Our results also focus on the heterogenous effects of COVID-19 on men and women's risk preferences. We do not obtain consistent results across all four risk-preference elicitation methods. Based on the BART results, men are more sensitive, and become more risk-averse during COVID-19; there is no change in women's risk-preference according to BART. We find a gender gap in risk preferences in the pre-pandemic period based on BART, however, this difference disappears during the pandemic. In both DOSPERT and SSS, women respond more to COVID-19 compared to men and become more risk-averse in the specific Social and Experience Seeking domains. There are no changes in risk-preference for both men and women according to a GC task (Eckel and Grossman, 2008) .",

I often wish I could be a mountain climber. B. I can't understand people who risk their necks climbing mountains.\" Participants must choose one of the two options for each item. The SSS yields one total score and four primary sub-scales with 10 items for each sub-scale: (1) Thrill and Adventure Seeking (TAS, desire to engage in sports or activities involving speed and danger; e.g., mountain climbing), (2) Experience Seeking (ES, desire to experience through the mind and senses, travel, and a non-conforming lifestyle; e.g., dressing in strange ways), (3) Disinhibition (DIS, desire for social and sexual disinhibition; e.g., \"uninhibited\" parties), and (4) Boredom Susceptibility (BS, aversion to repetition, routine, and dull people; e.g., preference for unpredictable friends). The SSS has been shown to be reliable across cultures, ages, and genders (Zuckerman et al., 1978) . The concept of sensation seeking is presumed to account for differences in people's willingness to participate in risky activities across a wide range of behaviors (Zuckerman, 1994) . Higher scores in SSS indicate higher risktaking. The self-reported risk-taking measures in SSS have been found to be associated with risky behavior in different settings (Zaleski, 1984; Wong and Carducci, 1991; Zuckerman, 2007) . The description of the scales and item loadings are listed in the Appendix.",

BART and GC are incentivized behavioral measures eliciting the revealed risk preferences. DOSPERT and GC are self-reported propensity measures accessing the stated risk preferences. The question about whether risk-preference should be conceptualized as a general psychological construct, or as domain-specific construct, or as a combination of both has received a great deal of attention in psychology and economics (Zhong et al., 2009; Benjamin et al., 2012; Highhouse et al., 2017) . If the nature of risk-preference is a general construct, then risk-preference should be a stable psychological trait across time and domains; if risk-preference is domain-specific, then it includes various traits in different domains such as finance, health, and experience. Frey et al. (2017) used 39 riskpreference measures to study the psychometric structure of riskpreference, and they suggest that the construct of risk-preference contains both general and domain-specific components, with a general factor of risk-preference explaining half of the variance and a series domain-specific factors explaining the other half. Frey et al. (2017) also suggest a substantial gap between behavioral and propensity risk-preference measurement traditions. Both Frey et al. (2017) and Mata et al. (2018) argue a primacy of self-reported propensity measures over behavioral measures by studying the temporal stability, convergent validity, and predictive validity of the measures.",

We published a Human Intelligence Task (HIT) on MTurk. The HIT provided instructions about the type, length, payment, and IRB information for the experiment. The workers on MTurk decided whether they want to participate or not after reading the instruction 4 . The experiment was computerized in Inquisit (Inquisit, 2016) . Interested workers were instructed to click on a link included in the HIT that took them to the experiment implemented by the Inquisit web lab. The first page of the experiment was the electronic consent form. Participation was voluntary and workers could decide to quit at any time. For those who completed the experiment, a unique random ID was generated on the last page of the experiment. Workers were required to submit their code through MTurk. We later used these ID-codes to make the payments by linking the codes recoded on our experiment to the workers' MTurk account. Workers' earnings included a fixed participation fee and a bonus from the incentivized BART and GC tasks during the experiment. The average payment was $2. The experiment consists of four rounds. The first round was conducted on February 21, 2020, which we refer to as the prepandemic round. For the pre-pandemic round, we use the entire between-subject treatments in Zhang and Palma (2021) . The original design in Zhang and Palma (2021) was between-subjects with three treatment groups varying in insurance schemes set in the BART: Voluntary Insurance, Compulsory Insurance, and Mixed Insurance. In each treatment group, participants were asked to work on the tasks in the following order: BART, DOSPERT, SSS, and GC. A demographic survey was included at the end of the experiment. Each subject was only allowed to participate in one treatment, and hence there is no income or order effect concerns.",

The difference in risk-taking behavior for men between the pre and on-pandemic rounds is significant (p = 0.001). We further find the change in men's risk-taking is overall swift, instead of just from a small subgroup. Table 3 compares the distribution of men in each pump range between pre-pandemic and on-pandemic rounds 6 . There is swift from pumps over 64 to pumps less than 64. Figure 2 shows that the gender gap in risk-taking behavior assessed by BART is present before COVID-19, with women being more risk averse than men (Mann-Whitney U-Test, p = 0.048). However, due to the reaction of men to COVID-19, the gender gap in risk aversion disappears during the on-pandemic rounds (p = 0.790). We further show that there are no significant differences by age (p = 0.612), education (p = 0.523), race (p = 0.443), or income (p = 0.342) between men and women.

In addition, the change is an overall swift of the distribution of females in each score range (refer to Appendix 9). The Socialdomain in DOSPERT tests for the willingness to challenge social norms or social risky behavior such as confronting coworkers or family members. Social-domain in DOSPERT contains six items. We find the changes in womens' risk-preference mainly come from two items \"Choosing a career that you truly enjoy over a more prestigious one\" and \"Starting a new career in your mid-thirties.\" During COVID-19, many companies started to lay off workers, freeze hiring, and cut bonuses. The worries about losing jobs or being not able to find new jobs during the pandemic may cause people to become more risk-averse in the Social domain, especially for women based on our results. This is also in line with the literature about the gender layoff gap in the labor market during COVID-19 (Lin-Sperry, 2021). Figure 5 shows the comparisons of DOSPERT-Total scores by gender. Based on the risk-attitudes elicited by DOSPERT, women are more risk-averse than men before COVID-19 (Mann-Whitney U-Test, p = 0.009). Since we only find changes in the Social sub-domain for women, and there is no significant change in the total score of men and women during COVID-19, there is still a gender gap in risk-attitudes elicited by DOSPERT during COVID-19 (p = 0.001).",

The change in SSS-Total scores for women is mainly contributed by the sub-scale \"Experience Seeking\" (p < 0.001). \"Experience Seeking\" measures the desire to experience through travel and non-conforming lifestyles. COVID-19 makes women more riskaverse in the \"Experience Seeking\" aspect. Figure 6 shows that the effects of COVID-19 on womens' riskpreference assessed by SSS are persistent for 2 weeks.

These results match our hypotheses about the stability of risk-preference based on different measures. The only result which conflicts our hypothesis is the increased risk aversion of men measured by BART. One possible explanation is that BART measures risk-taking by averaging choices over 30 balloons, instead of only based on one choice as in GC. The process of pumping repeated 30 balloons can be dynamic with the choice being affected by outcomes of previous balloons 8 . When different measuring processes interact with the pandemic, ",

Table 7 shows that in our experiment risk-preference measured by BART is positively correlated with risk-preference measured by the GC and SSS. The correlation of risk-preference measured by BART and DOSPERT total scores is not significant; however, the riskpreference measured by the Social sub-domain is significantly correlated with risk-preference measured in BART (Spearman's \u03c1 = 0.107, p = 0.055). We find similar outcomes for riskpreference elicited by the GC, and it is significantly correlated with the risk-preference measured by the Financial sub-domain in DOSPERT (Spearman's \u03c1 = 0.178, p = 0.001). The riskpreference measured by SSS is significantly correlated with all other three methods. We further test the degree of correlations in Table 7 , and we have three arguments. First, all the correlations are positive, and this to some extent provides evidence of the validity of each method for assessing risk-preference. Second, the correlation between self-reported risk-preference (measured by DOSPERT and SSS) is stronger than the correlation between revealed risk-preference (elicited by BART and GC). This result is in line with the suggestions about lower convergent validity of revealed behavioral measures compared to self-reported propensity measures in both Frey et al. (2017) and Mata et al. (2018) . Third, the correlations between two different types of measures are the weakest (BART/GC & DOSPERT/SSS), which is also suggested by Frey et al. (2017) .",
