A systematic review and metaanalysis found that older adults with higher resilience were less likely to have depressive symptoms [8] ; however, no Australian studies were included. To our knowledge, only two studies of resilience and depression have been undertaken in Australia. One study among Iranian immigrants living in Australia found lower levels of resilience associated with higher levels of depression [9] . In contrast, another study found no significant associations between resilience and depression among homeless people in regional Australia [10] . The association between resilience and anxiety was also investigated in another study that found higher levels of resilience was associated with less anxiety among Australians aged 55-90 years [11] . Additionally, several pilot interventions that aimed to improve participants' resilience through education workshops appeared to have positive effects in mitigating workplace stress among Australian nurses [12] [13] [14] . However, these previous studies are limited by their cross-sectional design or were not conducted among the general population. A more recent study of Australian parents reported loneliness as a significant contributor to stress during the pandemic, however high levels of social support were associated with both lower stress and anxiety [15] . Healthcare professionals are also predisposed to significant distress and anxiety, despite high levels of resilience, suggesting resilience alone is insufficient as a protective toll against poor mental health [16] .",

For example, a positive item states \"I tend to bounce back quickly after hard times\" while a negative item states \"I have a hard time making it through stressful events\". Responses were provided on a 5-point Likert scale with anchors at 1 (strongly disagree) and 5 (strongly agree). The scale was scored by reverse coding the negative items and then averaging the total score for the six items. Final scores range from 1.0-5.0 with a score of 3.0-4.3 considered a normal level of resilience [25] .",

This is likely due to the samples (both longitudinal and cross-sectional) including mostly Australian adults (about three quarters) with high or normal levels of resilience. Therefore, they may manage and adapt well to the impacts caused by the pandemic. Another factor may be that the Australian government was effective in responding to the pandemic (ranking 3rd among OECD countries) and providing Australians with financial support and mental health consultation via telehealth [30] , and therefore helping to alleviate the impacts. It is less likely, but also possible, that levels of resilience may have decreased between pre-COVID-19 and our first survey. Unfortunately, pre-COVID-19 data are not available for comparison. However, one study comparing two cross-sectional samples in small towns in upstate New York found no significant difference in resilience between pre-COVID-19 (November and December 2019) and peak-COVID-19 (mid-April 2020) [5] .",

The positive effects of physical activity on resilience may occur through improving mental health and possible underlying mechanisms for this were discussed by Silverman et al. (2014) [20] . For example, physical activity could serve as a buffer against stress and stress-related disorders. Physical activity also has benefits on brain and hormonal stress-responsive systems that could improve mood and cognition [20, 40] . In this study, we found that physical activity was associated with resilience, independent of depression, anxiety, and stress levels. Although the effect size of physical activity (adjusted difference of 0.07 points) was small compared to that of depression (0.30 points), anxiety (0.19 points), and stress (0.12 points). Given that physical activity has other benefits on both physical and mental health [17] , it is still an important factor for consideration in interventions targeting resilience levels.",

Second, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first longitudinal study to explore levels of resilience during the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia. However, the study has limitations. Participation in this study was voluntary with nearly half of the sample having at least one chronic health condition and therefore, the findings may not be generalisable to populations with different characteristics. The self-reported questionnaires are also subject to recall bias, despite being validated instruments. In addition, the first survey started when the pandemic had already begun; and no pre-COVID-19 data was available. Therefore, it is not possible to know whether (and how) resilience scores changed between the pre-COVID-19 period and the first survey.",

Primary health care providers, Government websites, not-for-profit, or other mental health services could provide rapid screening then direct people to appropriate care.",
