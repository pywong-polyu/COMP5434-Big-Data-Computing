Methods We distributed a questionnaire in Jordan among physicians, dentists and nurses who received a COVID-19 vaccine to explore the side effects (SE) they encountered after the first or the second dose of one of three vaccines namely: AstraZeneca Vaxzevria (AZ), Pfizer-BioNTeck (PB), and SinoPharm (SP) vaccines. Results A total of 409 professionals participated. Approximately 18% and 31% of participants reported no SE after the first dose and second dose, respectively. The remainder had mostly local side effects related to injection site (74%). Systemic side effects in the form of fatigue (52%), myalgia (44%), headache (42%), and fever (35%) prevailed mainly after the first dose. These were significantly associated with AZ vaccine, and age \u2264 45 years (p = 0.000 and 0.01, respectively). No serious SE were reported. Conclusions We can conclude that SE of COVID-19 vaccines distributed in Jordan are within the common range known so far for these vaccines. Further studies are needed to include larger sample size and longer follow-up period to monitor possible serious and long-term SE of the vaccines.",

The lower rate of side effects in second dose recipients noticed in this study is probably correlated to the variation in numbers of various vaccine recipients among first and second dose recipients. Less than 4% of the second dose recipients (compared to 44% of first dose recipients) have received AZ vaccine which was found to be the one highly associated with side effects. On the other hand, approximately 45% of second dose recipients have received SP vaccine, the one with minimal side effects. Most participants who received SP vaccine did not report any side effects after any of the two doses indicating the weak immunogenic potential of the vaccine. Inactivated vaccines are said to have a good safety profile, however, they need a booster plan to create immune memory [12] . Most participants had local side effects associated with post-injection pain and numbness. Among systemic side effects, fatigue represented the most common symptom after both first and second doses. Other cited side effects included myalgia, headache, fever, arthralgia, and bone pain. According to Centers of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the common adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccines include pain, swelling and redness at injection site, as well as fatigue, chills, fever, myalgia, headache, and nausea [5] . A minority of participants reported gastrointestinal side effects (nausea, Vaccines 2021, 9, 577 8 of 10 vomiting, diarrhea), respiratory side effects (dyspnea), and there were some sporadic cases of ear symptoms, facial pain, sleepiness, and diuresis.",

It was reported that Vaxzevria had mild adverse reactions including chills, fatigue, headache, fever, nausea, muscle aches, malaise, and painful injection sites within a week post-vaccination [15] . As a prophylactic measure, paracetamol was recommended to reduce these post-vaccination local and systemic reactions [16] . It was noticed that there were not significant differences between males and females in development of systemic side effects, however, participants who were 45 years or younger had significantly more systemic side effects. Vaxzevria was described as being better tolerated in older adults than in younger adults and has similar immunogenicity across all age groups after a boost dose [4] . Most of the reported local and systemic adverse events in the literature were mild to moderate in severity, and it was found that booster vaccination was associated with fewer adverse effects than the first dose of vaccination and reactogenicity reduced with increasing age [4] . Age restrictions in vaccine selection have been applied in several countries. Although the MHRA recommended against age restrictions in AZ vaccine use, the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) in the UK advised that people younger than 30 should be offered alternative vaccines where available [17] . Currently, several countries inside and outside Europe have put age restrictions to AZ vaccine recipients [17] . If there are going to be age restrictions in Jordan as well, there is a possibility that a large sector of the population will be offered other alternatives because the median age is estimated to be 23.8 years. Of interest are the gastrointestinal symptoms affecting recipients of AZ vaccine. The vaccine was found to be clearly associated with diarrhea, nausea and vomiting. This may be explained by the nature of this vaccine (S glycoprotein) and its influence on the gastrointestinal system, an influence that was previously elucidated for SARS-CoV-2 itself [18] . No serious SE are being reported by our study. According to EMA, 30 cases of thromboembolic events (predominantly venous) had been reported by 10 March 2021, among the approximately 5 million recipients of the Vaxzevria in the European Economic Area [19] . It is recommended that people who have persistent and very severe headaches within the first 2-3 weeks after vaccination get further evaluation. A safety update released by the EMA on 16 April 2021 specified thrombocytopenia as a new common side effect (in <1 in 10 persons) and thrombosis in combination with thrombocytopenia as a new very rare side effect (in <1 in 10,000 persons). Side effects included shortness of breath, chest or persistent abdominal pain, leg swelling, severe or persistent headache, blurred vision, persistent bleeding, and skin bruising or round, pinpoint spots beyond the site of vaccination appearing after a few days [20] .

            "text": "Our study included three vaccines, two of them have attracted attention worldwide. SP vaccine has been under the spotlight because of its rather \"quiet\" profile, while AZ vaccine has been surrounded by noise in several pivotal areas of the world. The results of this study confirmed that SP is really a \"quiet\" vaccine since it was significantly associated with symptom-free vaccination. However, these findings neither confirm its efficacy, nor exclude its long-term SE. On the other hand, AZ vaccine was found to be most significantly associated vaccine with post vaccination side effects. However, it should be noted that no serious SE were reported, and that recovery in all affected participants was achieved in a duration of days.",

Contracting COVID-19 infection after being vaccinated is consistent with the less than 100% efficacy rate that the producers of COVID-19 vaccines reported after both doses. Vaccine effectiveness in preventing COVID-19 was reported to be 95% for PB [24] and 70.4% for AZ vaccine [25] . As for SP the picture is not yet clear, with efficacy ranging from 50% to 78% according to trials conducted on this vaccine in some countries [11] .",

Another limitation is that the study did not investigate medical status of participants, and how this could have influenced their responses to the vaccines. Therefore, we cannot rule out the influence of medical status as an important confounder in determining vaccine SE. Not all our participants have received the second dose yet because it is to be taken in the near future. It was important to include all those who received one or two doses due to the urgent and ongoing nature of vaccine evaluation. Further, response rate could not be determined because at the time of conducting this study the total number of vaccinated healthcare workers in Jordan was not yet known. Therefore, we included a convenient sample. The main strength of this study is that the study sample was derived from healthcare professionals who are expected to provide transparent information based on their medical and scientific background.",
