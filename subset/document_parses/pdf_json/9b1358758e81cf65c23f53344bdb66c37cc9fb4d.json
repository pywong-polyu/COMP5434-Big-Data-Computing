Tafenoquine [TQ], an FDA-approved 8-aminoquinoline [8AQ] antimalarial, can be administered orally, weekly, for up to six months, and is differentiated relative to the 4-aminoquinolines [4AQs] hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and chloroquine (CQ) in that it does not prolong QTc interval and acts more broadly against a variety of malaria life cycle stages via different mechanisms of action [1, 6, 10]. Specifically, 4AQs kill malaria parasites with the same mode of action as has been proposed for their anti-coronavirus effects, by increasing intravacuolar pH [22, 24]. While mechanisms of action of 8AQs are poorly defined, recent studies have suggested malaria parasites are killed site-specifically by hydrogen peroxide accumulation generated by a two-step biochemical relay involving monooxygenases and cytochrome P450:NADPH oxidoreductase [6]. Also, tafenoquine is active against the lung pathogen Pneumocystis in vitro and in vivo at pharmacologically relevant concentrations and doses [4, 16] .

Supernatants were harvested and virus titer determined at each time point via virus yield assay as described earlier.

This observation provides indirect evidence of a differing mode of action between the 8 and 4-aminoquinolines against SARS-CoV-2 that warrants further investigation. For the purposes of establishing proof of hope (i.e. expectation that pharmacologically relevant concentrations at the target site can be achieved clinically and a likelihood that a relevant therapeutic index exists), we sought to estimate TQ lung concentrations achieved following the first four doses of the FDA-approved dose of TQ for malaria prophylaxis [200 mg/day for three days, followed by 200 mg seven days later [1]].

The EC90u was determined by multiplying the EC90 by the estimated unbound fraction to correct for non-specific binding in culture medium containing 2% FBS, a protein concentration of approximately 90 ng/mL.
