Salvianic acid A sodium (SAAS) is an active compound derived from the well-known herbal medicine Danshen, which has been widely used for clinical treatment of cardiovascular diseases in China. This study aimed to confirm the cardioprotective effects of SAAS in rats with myocardial infarction and to investigate the underlying molecular mechanisms based on proteome and transcriptome profiling of myocardial tissue. The results showed that SAAS effectively protected against myocardial injury and improved cardiac function. The differentially expressed proteins and genes included important structural molecules, receptors, transcription factors, and cofactors. Functional enrichment analysis indicated that SAAS participated in the regulation of actin cytoskeleton, phagosome, focal adhesion, tight junction, apoptosis, MAPK signaling, and Wnt signaling pathways, which are closely related to cardiovascular diseases. SAAS may exert its cardioprotective effect by targeting multiple pathways at both the proteome and transcriptome levels. This study has provided not only new insights into the pathogenesis of myocardial infarction but also a road map of the cardioprotective molecular mechanisms of SAAS, which may provide pharmacological evidence to aid in its clinical application.",

The animals were randomly divided into four groups: (1) a sham group, in which the rats underwent the same surgical procedures as the rats in the other groups without ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery (n = 20); (2) a myocardial infarction (MI) model group, in which MI rats received saline at the same volume as that used for injection of SAAS (n = 30); (3) a 24 mg/kg SAAS group, in which MI rats received SAAS at 24 mg/kg every day (n = 30); and (4) a 96 mg/kg SAAS group, in which MI rats received SAAS at 96 mg/kg every day (n = 30). Before surgery, animals in the SAAS treatment groups were administered SAAS intraperitoneally at doses of 24 and 96 mg/kg for ten days, while animals in sham and model groups received the same volume of saline. The myocardial infarction model was induced by ligation of left anterior descending coronary artery as described previously [14] . Briefly, the rats were anesthetized with ether and placed on a warming pad for maintenance of body temperature. The thorax of each rat was shaved and disinfected with 75% alcohol. A left thoracotomy was performed in the intercostal space at the muscle layer between the third and fourth rib. The pectoralis muscle groups were separated transversely, exposing the rib cage. The pericardium was gently opened, and the left coronary artery was isolated. A 3/8 needle carrying a 5.0 suture was inserted approximately 2 mm below the root of the left atrial appendage, and the left anterior descending artery was rapidly ligated.

Twenty-four hours after surgery, the serum contents of LDH, CK, CK-MB, and cTnI in the model group were markedly increased compared with those in the sham group. In the groups subjected to MI and treated with SAAS (24 or 96 mg/kg), the levels of these myocardial markers were significantly decreased compared to those in the MI model group (P < 0.01; Fig. 2a ). The LDH levels were decreased by 9.2% and 28.9% (P < 0.01), CK release was decreased by 25.0% and 36.9% (P < 0.01), the CK-MB levels were decreased by 6.7% and 45.9% (P < 0.01), and cTnI was decreased by 37.3% and 59.2% (P < 0.05) in the 24 Cardiac function was examined by echocardiography on the 21st day after coronary artery ligation. As shown in Table 1 and Fig. 2b (upper panel) , the left ventricular internal diameter in diastole (LVIDd) was increased by 26.9% and the internal diameter in systole (LVIDs) was increased by 93.5% (P < 0.01) in the MI model group compared to the sham group. Concomitantly, in the MI model group, the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and fractional shortening (LVFS) were decreased by 47.7% and 57.0%, respectively, compared with those in the sham group (P < 0.01). SAAS treatment at doses of 24 and 96 mg/kg effectively improved left ventricular function compared with the model group. LVIDd was decreased by 12.8% and 17.1% (P < 0.01), LVIDs was decreased by 27.2% and 33.7% (P < 0.01), LVEF was increased by 47.8% and 67.6% (P < 0.01), and LVFS was increased by 59.5% and 98.6% (P < 0.01) in 24 and 96 mg/kg SAAS groups, respectively, compared to the model group. Nitrotetrazolium blue chloride (NBT) staining showed obvious myocardial injury due to MI, while SAAS reduced the infarct size ( Supplementary Fig. S1 ). H&E and Masson's trichrome staining illustrated that the epicardium and endocardium of left ventricle in the sham group were intact, presenting neat myocardial cell arrangement with adjacent myofibrils. Conversely, in animals subjected to ligation surgery, myocardial cells were infarcted, swollen, and degenerated. These changes were accompanied by cardiac necrosis, loss of transverse striations, and thinning of the ventricular wall. SAAS therapy significantly decreased cardiac apoptosis and attenuated cardiac fibrosis in MI rats, another feature of ventricular remodeling (Fig. 2b, middle and lower panels) .",

Cellular myosin plays an important role in cytoskeletal reorganization, and studies have found that the absence of Myh10 leads to a decrease in the number of embryonic cardiac myocytes [20] . Cardiac fibrillary collagens determine the physical properties of the left ventricular chamber and integrate adjacent cardiomyocytes into a coordinated biologic pump for blood circulation, which is of vital importance for the development of heart disease [21, 22] .

As sources of oxidants in the heart, monoamine oxidases might be beneficial for therapy of cardiovascular pathologies [24] . The annexins are a group of calcium-dependent phospholipid-binding proteins closely associated with the progression and metastasis of certain cancers, and accumulated studies have indicated that some annexins might play roles in cardiovascular diseases [25] . Anxa2 has been identified as an MI drug target by network analysis, and Anxa1 is an important effector of inflammation [26, 27] . Postn has been reported to induce proliferation of differentiated cardiomyocytes and recruit activated fibroblasts through FAK-integrin signaling to promote cardiac repair, which is essential for cardiac healing after MI [28, 29] . In contrast, there is also evidence that Postn inhibition might contribute to cardiac remodeling after MI [30] . Fbn1 is an important constituent of the myocardium, and its increased expression may affect myocardial stiffness, contributing to tissue fibrosis and repair [31] . Microfibrillar-associated proteins belong to the fibrinogen-related protein superfamily and are important for the development of the cardiovascular system [32] . Reduced activity of the Ptgis gene could be a genetic marker for MI and lead to its pathogenesis [33] . Macrod1 has been found to be a biomarker for the prediction and detection of MI [34] . Tmod4 was found to be a critical gene in postnatal mouse myocardial proliferation and development by a genomics approach [35] . These 14 potential molecules could be novel biomarkers for the prediction and detection of MI-induced injury.",

Phagosomes participate in tissue remodeling, clear apoptotic cells, and restrict the spread of intracellular pathogens [43] . Autophagosomes are present in surviving cardiomyocytes during chronic stages of myocardial infarction to inhibit apoptosis and mitigate deleterious effects, which may alleviate cardiac dysfunction and enhance remodeling [44] . A number of studies have clearly established roles for focal adhesion kinase (FAK) in angiogenesis and the development of the cardiovascular system and possible roles in heart diseases, including cardiac hypertrophy [45] . Tight junctions are essential for establishing a selectively permeable barrier to diffusion through the paracellular space between neighboring cells [46] . MAPK signaling, which regulates a variety of cellular activities including proliferation, survival, differentiation, and death, has been reported to be active in cardiovascular health and diseases [47] . Wnt signaling is an essential regulator of cardiovascular differentiation, morphogenesis, and progenitor cell self-renewal [48] .",

Numerous findings indicated the existence of coordinated regulation of important structural molecules, receptors, transcription factors, and cofactors and suggested that these molecules were mainly involved in regulation of actin cytoskeleton, phagosome, focal adhesion, tight junction, apoptosis, MAPK signaling, and Wnt signaling pathways at both the transcriptome and proteome levels. Taken together, the results indicate that SAAS may exert its cardioprotective effects by targeting multiple pathways at the proteome, transcriptome, and probably metabolome levels, which may provide pharmacological evidence to aid in its clinical application.",
