            "text": "S100A12 (calgranulin C) and the S100A8/A9 (calprotectin or calgranulin A/B) complex belong to the S100/calgranulin subfamily of Ca 2+ -binding proteins that play a central role in the innate immune responses (Foell et al., 2007) . S100A12 and calprotectin are released from activated macrophages and/or neutrophils and accumulated at sites of inflammation . Recent studies suggest fecal S100A12 and fecal calprotectin concentrations to be clinically useful markers of gastrointestinal inflammation in dogs . Increased fecal S100A12 concentrations are associated with clinical and endoscopic disease severity in dogs with chronic intestinal inflammation, can help to distinguish subgroups of canine chronic enteropathy and might be useful to predict the response to immunomodulatory treatment (Heilmann, Volkmann, et al., 2016) . Increased fecal calprotectin concentrations are also associated with the severity of clinical disease and can aid in predicting the response to immunomodulatory treatment (Grellet et al., 2013; Heilmann, Berghoff, et al., 2018) . The role of the fecal S100/calgranulin concentrations as biomarkers of localized inflammation such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is also an area of intensive investigation in human medicine (Foell et al., 2007; Lopez et al., 2017; Mendall et al., 2016; Wright et al., 2014) . Evaluation of the calgranulins as markers of inflammation further showed that the expression of S100A12 relative to that of the calprotectin complex (calgranulin ratio) has potential to characterize better and to offer further insight into the mechanism of particularly localized inflammatory disease processes (e.g. by differentiating acute and chronic diseases) (Heilmann et al., 2017; Lorenz et al., 2008) . The calgranulin ratio has been evaluated in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from people with inflammatory respiratory conditions (Lorenz et al., 2008) and in urine specimens from dogs with inflammatory or neoplastic urinary or urogenital diseases (Heilmann et al., 2017) . The calgranulin ratio in feces (fCalR) has not been evaluated or reported in humans or dogs with gastrointestinal conditions. Fecal S100/calgranulin concentrations were shown to be affected by increasing age, obesity, diet and also other lifestyle factors in people (Mendall et al., 2016; Park & Kim, 2018; Poullis et al., 2004) . However, knowledge about the effects of patient factors (e.g. body condition) or lifestyle factors on fecal inflammatory markers, such as the S100/calgranulins, is currently scarce in small animal medicine. One investigation found healthy research colony dogs to have significantly higher fecal calprotectin concentrations than healthy pet dogs (Heilmann et al., 2008) . Very young age was linked to higher fecal calprotectin concentrations in puppies (Grellet et al., 2016) . However, there was no age effect on fecal calprotectin concentrations in healthy adult dogs (Heilmann et al., 2008) . Fecal S100A12 concentrations were not associated with age in healthy puppies and adult dogs (Heilmann, Grellet, et al., 2018; Heilmann, Lanerie, et al., 2011) . Sex-related differences in fecal S100A12 concentrations were also not observed in that study (Heilmann, Lanerie, et al., 2011) . Shedding of enteropathogens (viral and/or parasitic agents) did not affect fecal S100A12 or fecal calprotectin concentrations (Grellet et al., 2016; Heilmann, Grellet, et al., 2018) , but the fecal score and breed size affected fecal S100A12 concentrations in healthy puppies (Heilmann, Grellet, et al., 2018) .",

Thus, more work is needed to determine factors influencing fecal S100/calgranulin concentrations in normal dogs, and evaluation of the possibility of such associations is an important prerequisite for further clinical validation of the fecal S100/calgranulins as biomarkers of gastrointestinal disease in dogs. To fill this knowledge gap, the effect of age, sex, reproductive status, body weight and body condition, breed, vaccination, endoparasite prophylaxis, diet, environment and travel history on fecal S100A12 and fecal calprotectin concentrations was evaluated in a large cohort of healthy adult dogs. We hypothesized that in dogs, the body condition, but not any other variables, is associated with fecal S100/calgranulin concentrations-but not their relation to each other expressed as fCalR. A second aim of this study was to establish reference intervals for fecal S100A12 and fecal calprotectin concentrations using single-spot fecal samples.",

Exclusion criteria were the previous diagnosis or a suspicion of a gastrointestinal disorder and the administration of medications that are known to affect the gastrointestinal tract (e.g. non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs). Twenty-one dogs (all recruited in the USA/Texas) were retrospectively excluded from the study due to the lack of sufficient information about the dog, leaving 181 dogs included in the study (Table 1) . Information gathered about each dog included: dog and owner identification; time and date of fecal sample collection; the age of the dog and/or date of birth; sex and neuter status; breed and breed size (small breed dogs: mean adult body weight of the respective breed \u226410 kg; mediumsized breed: 10-25 kg average adult body weight; and large-breed dogs: >25 kg average adult body weight); body weight and body condition score (BCS, using the 5-point scale (Kant et al., 2013) ); housing primarily indoor (with or without outdoor access) or housing outdoor; travel history (travel outside the country of residence); diet (premium diet or supermarket brand); medication, supplements and nutraceuticals given within 6 months prior to the dog being enrolled into the study; last vaccination and type of vaccine; last endoparasite treatment and dewormer used; and any medical condition. Dogs were considered to be current on vaccines if vaccinated within 12 months of study enrolment, and recent vaccination within 4 weeks of study enrolment and fecal sample collection.

Interestingly, increases in fecal calprotectin concentrations were associated with changes in the gastrointestinal microbiome in one human study (Verdam et al., 2013) , and changes in the gastrointestinal microbial profiles were shown to also differ between healthy lean and healthy obese dogs in one investigation by our group (Handl et al., 2013) . However, fecal calprotectin concentrations were found only to be associated with obesity in a research colony of dogs but not in pet dogs in a smaller follow-up study (Handl et al., 2010) .

However, an interesting finding in our study is an effect of reproductive (i.e. neuter) status on fecal calprotectin and (based on the ES), even more relevant, on fecal S100A12 concentrations (but both showing opposite trends), particularly in female dogs, in univariate analyses. This has not previously been reported, likely because the size of subgroups of dogs in previous studies(Heilmann, Lanerie, et al., 2011;Heilmann et al., 2008) precluded further analyses and thus the possibility of finding such an effect. Interpolation of results from other species is also very difficult because the effects of patient characteristics and environmental factors on fecal S100/calgranulin concentrations have only been evaluated in people. The possibility of an effect of postmenopausal status or oral contraceptive use on fecal S100/ calgranulin concentrations in women has not been investigated or reported (and would probably not be directly comparable with the situation in a spayed dog). Postmenopausal hormone changes are associated with altered immune profiles(Au et al., 2016) and",
