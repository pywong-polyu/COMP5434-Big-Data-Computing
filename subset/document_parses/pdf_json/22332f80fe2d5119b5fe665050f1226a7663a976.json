Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is characterized by persistent deficits in social communication and interaction skills as well as repetitive and restricted behavior patterns, interests, and activities. Communication and interaction impairment are shown in different contexts including socio-emotional reciprocity, nonverbal communicative behaviors, and in developing, understanding, and maintaining relationships. Stereotypy can be found in motor movements, use of objects, and speech; inflexible adherence to routines and hyper-or hypo-reactivity to sensory input are other characteristics. The spectrum integrates four pervasive developmental disorders that were considered distinct diagnoses in the DSM-IV: Asperger's disorder, autistic disorder, childhood disintegrative disorder, and pervasive developmental disorder are not otherwise specified. Prevalence in the U.S. and non-U.S. countries is around 1% of the population [25] . Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is characterized by persistent symptoms of inattention, impulsivity, and/or hyperactivity that interfere with functioning. Inattention may manifest in having difficulty sustaining focus, straying from activities, and being disorganized, for example. Impulsivity is defined by precipitous actions realized without forethought and potentially hurting the person. It may display in deciding without considering consequences and having socially intrusive behaviors. Hyperactivity is shown with excessive and inappropriate motor activity, resulting in extreme restlessness or also talkativeness. In the general population, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder is more frequent in boys than in girls. ADHD seems to occur across cultures in about 5% of children and about 2.5% of adults [25] .",

The cognitive deficits interfere with independence in everyday activities for which the person needs assistance, at least in complex instrumental ones. The maintenance of independent functioning distinguishes the mild and major neurocognitive disorders. Indeed, the mild neurocognitive disorder is characterized by a modest cognitive decline in the same cognitive domains, but cognitive impairment does not interfere with independent functioning in everyday activities [25] . Here, daily tasks become more laborious, and the person needs compensatory strategies [26] . Mild neurocognitive disorder represents a framework for the commonly used diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) [26] . Estimates of prevalence for dementia-congruent with major neurocognitive disorder-are about 1-2% at 65 years and 30% by 85 years, while for mild cognitive impairment-congruent with mild neurocognitive disorder-are variable, from 2 to 10% at 65 years and 5 to 25% by 85 years [25] .",

First, we proceeded in searching for scientific studies about LEAP Motion applications in the following four psychological domains: attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, autism spectrum disorder, dementia, and mild cognitive impairment. The authors accomplished their task using the EBSCO host platform and consulting the databases of PsycInfo, PubMed, Science Direct, Sociological Abstracts, PsycArticles, and Academic Search Complete. The authors also searched in Google Scholar to increase the chances of identifying the widest range of possible sources. Search terms were \"Leap Motion\" and \"ASD\", \"Leap Motion\" and \"ADHD\", \"Leap Motion\" and \"dementia\", \"Leap Motion\" and \"MCI\".",

Among the 71 results, 52 were excluded, based on the following exclusion criteria for a work: (a) it did not directly test or review LEAP Motion upon or for the target populations; (b) it encompassed physical rehabilitation only; (c) it did not assess the intervention effectiveness on psychological dimensions; (d) it was written in languages other than English or Italian. Finally, it was possible to identify 19 peer-reviewed publications that described LEAP Motion applications in the four psychological domains.",

Table A2 shows the main risks of bias within the selected reports. Nine studies did not report sampling criteria [14] [15] [16] 34, [39] [40] [41] 44, 48] . The possible absence of eligibility criteria may have induced a biased recruitment process. Furthermore, five studies did not report any information about blinding [14, 34, 41, 43, 48] . The possible absence of blinding could have had an influence on the outcomes. In two studies, participants were informed on the nature of the game beforehand [39, 40] . This could have modified participants' performance. Two studies used a non-probability sampling technique based on recommendation [39, 40] . A nonprobability sampling of this kind may have induced a biased recruitment process. Moreover, two studies did not include a clinical sample [42, 43] . One study included a sample with a diagnosis diverse from the targeted one [41] . Two studies did not specify sample diagnosis [44, 48] , and thus, their results are not easily generalizable to the target population. Besides, two studies used a male-only sample [35, 39] . Two studies excluded participants with technophobia from the sample [46, 47] . One study was unable to include very young children in the sample because of LEAP Motion accuracy issues [36] . One other study reported technical issues with LEAP Motion with older children [15] . Therefore, gesture-recognition problems could have affected the results. One study sampled the study population relying on scores from a non-diagnostic tool [23] . Participants with a normal score but a subjective cognitive impairment may have been wrongly included in the control group. One study used an assessment module that was originally used for rehabilitation and then adapted for cognitive screening [23] . Tasks included in the assessment module may have been difficult to deal with not because of the participants' cognitive impairment, but due to the prototype content design. Moreover, in two studies, the authors claimed that they used statistical models with a limited number of covariates, and they may have omitted some important confounders [46, 47] . This could have modified the outcomes. Finally, two studies used a single subject research design [37, 38] .",

[48] addressed them in a dual system for the rehabilitation of cognitive functions of children. Using an eye-tracker and LEAP Motion, participants could interact with an arithmetic gamified application and perform operations with numbers displayed on virtual flower's petals. Users could introduce the correct solution using the eye gaze and the hands, by stretching the same number of fingers as the number of the result. The main outcomes showed that this hand-eye coordination exercise helped to improve users' skills and attention, whereas the natural interaction devices proved to be engaging alternatives to handwriting or other kinds of interfaces. The underlying idea is that learning requires the interaction of different sensory modalities with activities that stimulate not only visual analysis and cognition, but also physical movements. This is also suggested by Capelo et al. [34] who used LEAP Motion in a multisensory virtual game, in which participants had to place different geometric figures (i.e., blocks, cubes, spheres) in color-matching containers. The authors found an increase in concentration and motivation levels, in a natural and entertaining interaction. Besides, the game promoted relaxation when children interacted with LEAP Motion because the device turned out to be easy to use.",

They employed it together with other devices to collect information about the rate of change in users' functional impairment in a task of fire evacuation of a virtual apartment, designed with different scenarios of growing difficulty. The authors aimed at improving the ecological validity of such measures as a screening tool for early dementia. The participants had to move on a treadmill to approximate the actual movements in front of a projection screen, and they could interact with the environment thanks to hand gestures (i.e., Leap Motion and Kinect), planning a strategy to evacuate safety. The results showed that virtual reality, motion tracking, and natural tasks could help in pre-dementia diagnosis, executive function assessment, and intervention.",

Considering the role of virtual reality, this could contribute to overcoming barriers to access assessment, therapies, and smart monitoring. For example, conducting therapeutic sessions at home could help to reduce economic and logistical costs for patients and families. Moreover, studies report that virtual-reality-based interventions provide settings that are similar to games, offering motivating and involving environments, thus allowing a prolonged training session and a better adherence to treatment [64] . Researchers should integrate in future studies training and analysis with caregivers, as they could help in extending interventions with patients, children, or the elderly at home with the device if correctly trained. This is relevant, considering that a wide range of studies supports the mediation of caretakers in interventions that, in this way, can lead to improvements for both patients and caregivers [65] . Here, the compact size and intuitive usage of the controller are valuable and make its application easily accessible for people with different technological expertise.",
