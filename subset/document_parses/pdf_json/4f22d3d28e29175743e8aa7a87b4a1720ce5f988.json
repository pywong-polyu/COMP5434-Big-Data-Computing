Pregnancy and the postpartum period are lifestages characterized by rapid change, new routines and experiences. Reproductive decision-making during these periods may include lifestyle changes to mitigate modifiable risk factors, creation of birth plans, selection of prenatal care providers, and choices about breastfeeding, infant care and other postnatal practices [1, 2] . Reproductive health promotion provides information, skills, and resources in preparation for conception, pregnancy, labor and delivery and the postnatal period. Prenatal health promotion, typically emphasizing labor and delivery, often takes the form of prenatal classes, delivered by public health units both in person and online [3] . For those not yet pregnant, a life-course approach to sexual and reproductive health promotion can help mitigate lifestyle risk factors and promote smoking cessation, appropriate gestational weight gain/physical activity and healthy diet in advance of conception [4] . Online prenatal health promotion can bridge gaps in healthcare access, using social media to address emerging health topics, [3] such as Zika virus and the COVID-19 pandemic.",

As with the Zika outbreak, COVID-19 has serious implications for pregnancy, necessitating perinatal-specific public health guidance [30, 31] . Pregnancy emerged gradually as a risk factor for severe COVID-19 illness [32] . COVID-19 vaccine roll-out across much of the Western world began in late 2020, including Canada, however this was complicated by the initial recommendation by the National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI) and other agencies, to withhold COVID-19 vaccination from pregnant people pending further evidence [33] . As our social media analysis was restricted to 2020, we did not capture public health government-Facebook promotion of COVID-19 vaccines, however our review of Canadian government health website content into early 2021 did yield updated NACI-messaging regarding vaccine safety during pregnancy and breastfeeding [34] . Whereas a limited number of government websites addressed COVID-19 risks of pregnancy complications/disease severity, Facebook posts predominantly focussed on disruptions to health services and related visitor restrictions/need for infection control -masks, physical distancing-at healthcare centers.",

In response to the heterogeneous public framing of any health risk issue, influenced by gender, race/ethnicity, emotions and experience, risk communication is most effective if the agency/spokesperson inspires trust [39] . Trust in government agencies may be gained by transparency, credibility, and acknowledgement of scientific uncertainty in the face of evolving information, [27, 39] however countering this trust is social media's contributions to the increasingly political polarization of science and the recognition of society's structural racism which contributes to inequities [40] . Performance indicators identified for Canadian public health emergency preparedness included credible, culturally-competent emergency leaders with bilateral crisis communication skills, community engagement, and redundant in emergency communication channels including social media [41] . Ottawa Public Health's creation of a distinct Parenting in Ottawa Facebook page with 100 perinatal-themed posts in 2020 suggests this agency has fully embraced social media and opportunities of community engagement. Ottawa Public Health consistently attributed authorship of perinatal health Facebook posts to named healthcare professionals with credentials (e.g. registered nurses, lactation consultants, nutritionists)-thereby imbuing their posts with expertise, credibility and authority. Beyond perinatal health, Ottawa Public Health emerged as the most followed local public health unit in North America on Twitter, entertaining and informing over 130,000 followers in 2021 with empathy, honesty, nuance, humor and celebrity endorsements to promote COVID-19 and other public health messaging. Although most public health social media applications emphasize community engagement, social media may also provide platforms for health professionals to network, collaborate and exchange emerging science and practices [42] .",

NGO websites more consistently provided COVID-19-themed perinatal health promotion, including content related to disease severity, vertical transmission, breastfeeding and pregnancy outcomes. Similarly, NGO Facebook posts more frequently mentioned infection control, breastfeeding and emotional health, in the context of COVID-19. Two NGOs profile important aspects of perinatal health that are often overlooked-fatherhood and the realities facing Indigenous pregnant people in Canada. Cohabitating fathers and non-biological partners, contribute to both the physical and psychosocial environments of pregnant people. The impact of the non-pregnant partner on pregnancy outcomes has been largely studied heteronormatively, using marriage status among the determinants of concordant health behaviors [43] . Bringing attention to fathers, and non-biological partners recognizes their contributions to modifiable risks to pregnancy such as smoking, exposure to secondhand smoke, physical activity [23] and intimate partner violence and social support [44] . Perhaps due to social support and relationship integrity, fathers' involvement in pregnancy is associated with better pregnancy outcomes and improved maternal health behaviors [45] . Influenza vaccination exhibits spousal concordance, with female partners generally influenced by positive health behaviors exhibited by male partners, [46] suggesting similar dynamics may occur with COVID-19 protective behaviors, although this remains to be studied.",
