Even though the distribution of false news in national disaster situations has been reported for a long time, little attention has been given to the quantitative research of the fake news problem from the audience's perspective. This study, therefore, aims to estimate how much tax taxpayers would gladly pay for a virtual public-run fact-checking system. Using a one-and-one-half bounded dichotomous choice contingent valuation method, a survey was conducted on 525 respondents in Korea, and the spike model was applied to distinguish zero willingness-to-pay (WTP). The results show that a household's WTP for the public fact-checking system is 10,652 KRW (9 USD), on average, in the form of income tax for five years. Given the amount is a regular payment in perpetuity, the total WTP is estimated at 23 billion KRW ($196 M) every year. The result also shows that an individual's WTP increases as his or her psychological damage caused by fake news is high, as well as his or her high reliance on news in a disaster situation.",

At the Munich Security Conference on February 15th, 2020, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus stressed that as information spreads rapidly through social media, like the spread of virus, it has become as important to fight against the infodemic as to fight epidemics (WHO, 2020) . Because of the long-run persistence of COVID-19, more and more information which should not be questioned are circulating easily and widely as the form of fake news through social media (Apuke and Omar, 2020) . The head of Public Health Emergencies at UNICEF, Carlos Navarro pointed out that much incorrect information in social media comes from traditional mass media (Zarocostas, 2020) . In this situation, some companies, such as Facebook, Twitter, Tencent, Pinterest, and Tiktok, working with WHO to track fake news, make an effort to provide evidence-based facts on their own platforms. Facebook, Twitter, and Google have even started cracking down on COVID-19 information not provided by reliable sources such as WHO website or the ministry of health.",

            "text": "Therefore, this study aims to confirm the necessity of fake news policies from the receivers' perspective by using the contingent valuation method (CVM). According to the previous literature, we are well aware that studies on users' acceptance are important in supporting public policies. If the direction of the organization's new business corresponds to individuals' common values and their interests, a high level of trust will be built between them, leading to strong support of their business (Hurley, 2006) and affects positively on the operation of policy such as reducing the costs of implementation (Chanley et al., 2000) . This applies equally to the fake news policy. In this study, a new media policy that supports to develop a technique tracking the fake news is considered as one of methods to deal with the fake news problem. By asking respondents' willingness-to-pay (WTP) for the new policy, especially in a disastrous situation, this study helps to identify correspondence between respondents' common values and the policy. As the quantitative amount of investment that the taxpayers actually want to pay is determined, the measured value can be used as the objective indicator of cost estimation for the relevant industries and public policies. Moreover, by analyzing the correlation between the characteristics of receivers and their payment, it can be used in the policy-making process that prevents fake news production and dissemination when national disaster strikes.",

They have studied the history of fake news, tried to define it, and to find patterns of fake news itself and its distribution. According to Burkhardt (2017) , information sharing in groups have caused fake news problem from the preprinting era. As the internet is publicly provided, the scale of fake news has increased and spread faster. In this trend, discussions on how to define the term 'fake news' have been actively conducted, and scholars have reached an agreement that fake news can be categorized into six types; satire, parody, fabrication, manipulation, propaganda, and advertising (Tandoc et al., 2017) . After establishing the definition of fake news, studies to determine the features of fake news have been conducted. Fake news has characteristics that are easy to assimilate emotionally and usually spread on social networks (Bakir and McStay, 2018; Vicario et al., 2016) . Additionally, there are specific linguistic features that distinguish legitimate information from fake news (Clarke et al., 2019) .",

According to the previous studies, there have been lots of fake news issues and numbers of people easily tend to be blinded by false news even if there are pieces of evidence telling the truth (Lewandowsky et al, 2012; van der Linden et al, 2020) . Not only the controversial political issues but also the various fields of news including the public health issue have had difficulties in correcting widespread belief from the false news. Similarly, in the financial investment issue, it is revealed that fake news has less effect than real information, but it causes statistically significant abnormal transactions and can draw more attention than genuine news (Clarke et al., 2019) . In other words, even though the outward effect of fake news is still less (some researchers even say that it is impossible to measure the influence of fake news itself), the previous studies have commonly agreed that the psychologically perceived effects of fake news are significant (Jang and Kim, 2018) . Moreover, in terms of policy, people are less able to distinguish fake news and true information than they think, so researchers stressed that it is more appropriate for governments to support individuals to develop their media literacy skills instead of instituting stronger regulations (Tambini, 2017) .",

Given that most people are aware of the fake news problem and how fast it spreads, publishers have critically important roles in solving the fake news problem (Nielsen and Graves, 2017) . Therefore, many studies have focused on developing automated detection technologies. A study revealed that based on the imperfect and unformatted features of fake news, it is possible to detect them by using an individual's social network (Shu et al., 2017) . Additionally, by learning the existing fake news data and linguistic features of fake news, it is possible to develop a highly accurate detection program (Wang, 2017). Using Twitter data related to the Moore Tornado and Hurricane Sandy in 2013, Rajdev and Lee (2015) established a highly accurate automated detection program of fake news through horizontal and vertical classifiers of users' behavior characteristics and linguistic features.",

Thus, many studies on how to solve the fake news problem have been conducted, and most of them focus on media literacy skills and detection technologies. However, the important thing is that the research on how much taxpayers are willing to pay and feel the necessity of the relevant technologies and policies is still lacking. In addition, although many researchers revealed that the fake news strongly stimulates and affects readers' cognition, the extent of their psychological damage remains unmeasured. Therefore, in this study, by using the CVM, we estimate WTP for the development of fake news technologies and policies in the shoes of real users. Furthermore, this study has significance for measuring the effect of fake news on readers' cognition and giving numerical evidence of future policies.",

In CVM, based on the utility difference model, respondents answer 'yes' if they are willing to pay the proposed cost, and otherwise, they answer 'no' (Kim et al., 2019) . Random utility function can be shown as Eq. (1), where j means whether they would like to pay (1) or not (0), S represents respondents' characteristics, and y indicates respondents' income. The random utility function is constituted by the deterministic part v and the random component \u220a that is not observable.

Reflecting the previous studies that indirect regulation supporting media literacy skills is more appropriate than legal restrictions (Jang and Kim, 2018; Tambini, 2017) , we described a reliability warning program of news sites or articles by referencing the French press Le Monde's fact-checking widget 'Les D\u00e9codeurs' as a virtual scenario (Les D\u00e9codeurs, 2017; Declambre, 2017; Bathke, 2016) . Additionally, we used the annual income tax for five years as a payment vehicle in that it is used to prevent fake news in 'national disaster situations'. For the WTP questions, we used open-ended questions for the pilot survey, and the main survey was designed with 1.5 bounded dichotomous choice questions (OOHBDC) like Fig. 1 (see the Appendix A for the CVM questionnaire). Table 2 is the distribution of 525 WTP responses by asking respondents to pay for the fake news policy for five years. The proposed initial value in the main survey was set in seven sections, as shown in Table 2 , based on the results of the pilot survey. It shows that the larger amount of bid proposed, the fewer people answered 'yes.' Table 3 shows the results of the OOHBDC model. Model 1 is a result without covariates, and Model 2 is the coefficient estimates for the explanatory variables. At first, Model 1 indicates that the estimated coefficient of the bid is negative, and the estimated coefficient of alpha is positive, which are statistically significant. In particular, according to the distribution of responses depending on proposed value, as shown in Table 2 , it can be confirmed that the negative coefficient of the bid is reasonably estimated.",

Given that the virtual scenario is about the program for the online news content, it is consistent with the media consumption pattern that younger people are more likely to pay for the online news media (Goyanes, 2014; Fletcher and Nielsen, 2017 ). Meanwhile, the education level is not statistically significant. The meaningful result is that the degree of psychological damage has a significant influence on their willingness-to-payment. Moreover, in disaster situations, the higher credibility of news media people have, the more WTP they are willing to pay; in other words, in a disaster situation, the higher reliance on mass media they have, the more sensitive to psychological damage they are due to a fake news problem. This reflects that in national disaster situations, the role of news content and media becomes more important than usual because they change audiences' attitudes about national hazards, increasing their ability to prepare and media work as communication tools connecting the affected areas and others in terms of reducing high level of uncertainty. (Perez-Lugo, 2004; Cheng et al., 2015) . Lastly, they think the seriousness of fake news problems and the disaster situation also have a positive correlation with their WTP.",

In this respect, this study is important because it confirms the necessity of the fake news policy from the position of real taxpayers. Secondly, the results of this research can be highly utilized because it presents the value of the policy in quantitative way. Given that individuals are willing to pay additional 1,089 KRW (0.94 dollars) for a fake news policy every year, the total amount of its funding, 22.76 billion KRW (196 million dollars) is 0.27% of total income tax levied by government in 2019 which is approximately 83.6 trillion won (72.21 billion dollars) (Korea National Tax Service, 2020). In this way, it is helpful to measure its value compared with other numerical figures in the policy-making process. Lastly, as the psychological damage makes people more sensitive to the fake news problem in national disaster situations, we can confirm that proactive policies are more important than reactive policies.",

Firstly, we need to notice that as the estimated value, willingness-to-pay for the fake news policy in this study is based on stated preference data, so it does not mean the quantitative scale of actual effects of fake news. In addition, since there are various ways for the government to respond to fake news, such as legislation, media literacy education, fact-checking institutions, and so on, the policy-makers should consider the possibility of changes on how much taxpayers are willing to pay and support the policy depending on the ways of response. Lastly, the study asked respondents to pay for the policy of preventing the spread of fake news in a narrow sense, national disaster situations. However, given that the interest and requirements of fake news policy have increased due to the prolonged national disaster situations with COVID-19, the audiences' needs for public action to regulate fake news are noteworthy.",
