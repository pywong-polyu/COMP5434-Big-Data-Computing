However, limited literature has investigated the role of the P2X7 receptor in lipid metabolism during adipocyte differentiation. This study sought to explore the regulatory roles of P2X7 in adipocytes. This study utilized the in vitro 3T3-L1 differentiation model. Lipid accumulation, intracellular triglyceride, and extracellular glycerol were determined. The selective P2X7 agonist BzATP and antagonist A438079 were administered to investigate the functions of P2X7. We found that the expression of P2X7 and the lipid accumulation increased during adipocyte differentiation from D0 to D4. When administered at D0/D2, A438079 attenuated, while BzATP enhanced the degree of lipid accumulation during adipocyte differentiation. Neither did BzATP and A438079 administration affect the expression of PPAR\u03b3 and C/EBP\u03b1 genes that increased at D4. In addition, both intracellular triglyceride and extracellular glycerol levels at D4 were reduced by A438079 treatment and enhanced by BzATP administration. When administered at stage 2 of adipocyte differentiation, BzATP consistently enhanced lipid accumulation and intracellular triglyceride and extracellular glycerol levels without affecting mRNA and protein levels of PPAR\u03b3 and C/EBP\u03b1 that increased at D4. However, treating A438079 or BzATP at D4 did not affect intracellular triglyceride formation and extracellular glycerol release in differentiated adipocytes at D7. Notably, BzATP administration at stage 2 exerted a concentrationdependent inhibition on the enhanced expression of PRDM16, PGC-1\u03b1, and UCP-1 at D4. Furthermore, BzATP administration at D0/D2 inhibited the protein and mRNA levels of sirtuin-3/5 at D4. BzATP treatment at stage 2 also suppressed the mRNA levels of sirtuin-3/5 genes upregulated by insulin. In conclusion, this study demonstrated P2X7 enhances lipid accumulation during adipogenesis by suppressing the expression of sirtuin-3/5 and the browning genes.",

Adipocyte differentiation involves a temporally regulated set of gene-expression events. Among them, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor \u03b3 (PPAR\u03b3) and members of CCAAT enhancer-binding proteins (C/EBPs) functionally synergize in adipogenesis. PPAR\u03b3 is the principal regulator of adipogenesis, and C/EBPs function at least in part by modulating PPAR\u03b3 expression (Mota de S\u00e1 et al., 2017; Ghaben and Scherer, 2019) . In addition, PPAR\u03b3 is required to maintain the differentiated state (Imai et al., 2004; Lefterova et al., 2014) . Expression of a dominantnegative PPAR\u03b3 in mature 3T3-L1 adipocytes causes dedifferentiation with loss of lipid accumulation and decreased expression of adipocyte markers like insulin-dependent glucose transporter (GLUT4), insulin receptor substrate (IRS), and C/EBP\u03b1. The activation of the transcription factor C/EBP\u03b1 is an essential downstream effect of PPAR\u03b3 (Ghaben and Scherer, 2019) . Furthermore, C/EBP\u03b2 and C/EBP\u03b4 play early catalytic roles in the differentiation cascade that induces the activation of the gene encoding C/EBP\u03b1 (Yeh et al., 1995; Wang and Hai, 2015) . These transcription factors can bind to several adipocyte gene promoters during differentiation, including PPAR\u03b3 (Ntambi and Young-Cheul, 2000; Wang and Hai, 2015) .",

            "text": "White adipocytes act as storage cells upon excess calories. In addition to adipolysis (also called lipolysis) that refers to the degradation of triglyceride (TG) to fatty acid and glycerol in white adipocytes, the browning effect of adipocytes is another crucial process in response to positive energy balance (Verkerke and Kajimura, 2021) . The browning of white adipose tissue (WAT) leads to reduced lipid accumulation and increased production of brown fat-like adipocytes within WAT, called beige adipocytes (Bartelt and Heeren, 2014; Abdullahi and Jeschke, 2016) . These beige adipocytes have a brown adipose tissue (BAT)-like phenotype and non-shivering thermogenic actions, with PR domain containing 16 (PRDM16), uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1), PPAR-\u03b3 coactivator (PGC) -1\u03b1, and silent information regulators (SIRTs) highly expressed (Bartelt and Heeren, 2014; Demine et al., 2019; Shuai et al., 2019) . Among them, mitochondrial sirtuin-3 (SIRT3) and sirtuin-5 (SIRT5) counteract oxidative stress and exert interconnected roles in metabolic networks (Ji et al., 2021) . Both SIRT3 and SIRT5 promote adaptive thermogenesis in BAT (Favero et al., 2018; Sebaa et al., 2019; Shuai et al., 2019) , although the exact mechanisms are still unclear. The inherent property of dissipating energy in brown and beige adipocytes might be beneficial in counteracting obesity and other metabolic diseases.",

            "text": "The purinergic receptors regulate cellular functions through their capacity to use extracellular ATP, adenosine, and other nucleotides and nucleosides for triggering intracellular signal transduction mechanisms (Coccurello and Volont\u00e9, 2020) . Among all purinergic receptors, the P2X7 receptor is a ligand-gated ion channel activated by high extracellular ATP concentration (Burnstock, 2006) . Because ATP is constitutively and passively released upon tissue injury or cell damage, the ATP-mediated signaling downstream from activation of P2X7 (possessing a higher dissociation constant for ATP compared with other P2 receptors) is related to the damage-associated molecular patterns. Activation of P2X7 for milliseconds rapidly triggers K + and Ca 2+ ions across the plasma membrane (Seeland et al., 2015) , leading to membrane permeabilization and a large, non-selective pore formation. Such a large pore allows molecules with molecular weight up to 900 Da to enter the cells. Consequently, it initiates several cellular events, including nucleotide-binding domain leucinerich repeat family pyrin domain-containing protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome formation, the opening of pannexin 1 and connexin hemichannels, membrane blebbing, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, and eventually cellular death (Schroder and Tschopp, 2010; Idzko et al., 2014; Lin et al., 2015; Di Virgilio et al., 2017; Sekar et al., 2018; Chiu et al., 2022) . P2X7 is widely expressed in several tissues, but it is not highly expressed in white or brown adipose tissues unless activated upon pharmacological agents or pathological environments (Jain and Jacobson, 2021) . Considering that P2X7 is unique in activating inflammatory cascades and chronic inflammation contributes to obesity development (Xu et al., 2003) , it is interesting to explore the relevance of P2X7 in adipose tissues. A human study revealed that the expression of P2X7 in visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissue of patients with metabolic syndrome was higher than controls (Madec et al., 2011) . Consistently, both mRNA and protein levels of P2X7 in WATs were significantly increased in ob/ob mice relative to age-matched WT lean mice (Sun et al., 2012) . The P2X7 mRNA level was elevated starting at six weeks of 60% high-fat diet (HFD), and the P2X7 protein was induced in adipose tissue after eight weeks of HFD (Sun et al., 2012) . Furthermore, P2X7-deficient mice on a regular diet have increased adipose tissue mass but decreased energy expenditure and fat oxidation (Beaucage et al., 2014; Giacovazzo et al., 2018) . However, P2X7-deficient mice on HFD exhibited no changes in metabolic phenotypes, inflammatory responses, or inflammasome activation compared with the wild-type controls (Sun et al., 2012) . On the other hand, a study focused on the role of P2X7 in the development of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease showed that P2X7 gene deletion protected mice from HFD-induced non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, possibly through blunted activation of NLRP3 inflammasome (Blasetti Fantauzzi et al., 2017) . Recent studies also suggest that P2X7 may regulate lipid metabolism in microglia or adipocytes through modulating ROS production (Bartlett et al., 2013) , mitochondrial activity (Seeland et al., 2015) , and autophagy (Fabbrizio et al., 2017) . Nonetheless, little literature has directly characterized the nature of P2X7 regarding adipogenesis and lipid metabolism. Therefore, this study utilized mouse 3T3-L1 adipocytes as the cell model to decipher the roles of P2X7 in adipocyte differentiation and lipid metabolism.

To verify adipocyte differentiation, two sequential adipogenic factors PPAR\u03b3 and C/EBP\u03b1 were measured. The immunoblotting data validated the in vitro adipocyte differentiation in the 3T3-L1 cell model by showing marked increases in PPAR\u03b3 expression from the end of D2 and C/EBP\u03b1 expression at the end of D4 (Figure 2A) . Compared with a maximal induction of PPAR\u03b3 and C/EBP\u03b2 expression at D2 followed by a decline at D4, a continuous increase in mRNA level up to D4 was observed for C/EBP\u03b1. The early rise of PPAR\u03b3 and c/EBP\u03b2 gene expression at D2 accounts for the sequentially remarkable gene expression of C/EBP\u03b1 observed at D4 ( Figure 2B ). We found that A438079 (10 \u03bcM) and BzATP (50 \u03bcM) administration at D0/D2 did not affect the protein levels of both transcription factors during adipocyte differentiation ( Figure 2A) . Moreover, A438079 did not alter the upregulated mRNA levels of these transcription factors upon adipocyte differentiation since D2. BzATP increased the mRNA level of PPAR\u03b3 at D2 and D4 but did not alter the mRNA levels of C/EBP\u03b1 and C/ EBP\u03b2 at D2 and D4 ( Figure 2B) . These data suggest that P2X7 does not affect adipocyte differentiation. TG is the major lipid component in adipocytes. It can be metabolized to free fatty acid and glycerol by hormone-sensitive lipase. Because glycerol can be secreted via AQPad (aquaporin adipose), we determined intracellular TG and extracellular glycerol. As shown in Figure 2C , intracellular TG level was increased in differentiated adipocytes at D4 compared to preadipocytes. A438079 treatment attenuated, while BzATP administration increased this effect. Similarly, secreted glycerol level was higher in differentiated adipocytes at D4 than in preadipocytes, and this increase was reduced by A438079 treatment while further enhanced by BzATP administration. These findings suggest that P2X7 is involved in lipid metabolism by increasing lipid accumulation in differentiated adipocytes at D4.",

            "text": "Obesity has been linked to several chronic diseases, cardiometabolic comorbidities, malignancies, and COVID-19 severity (World-Health-Organization, 2021; Chiang et al., 2013; Chiang and Huang, 2014; Chen et al., 2021; Gammone and D'Orazio, 2021) . The impaired inner energy regulation and the obesogenic environment lead to the risk of arriving at a pathological state of obesity (Grannell et al., 2021) . The majority of excess energy is sequestered as TGs in lipid droplets of WATs. One promising weight-reducing strategy is to increase energy expenditure by activating thermogenic brown and beige adipocytes (Verkerke and Kajimura, 2021) . In a pathological environment with high extracellular ATP levels such as obesity, the ATP-activated P2X7 receptor acts as a sensor and arouses accumulating concern in metabolic disorders (Jain and Jacobson, 2021) . However, inconsistent directions between P2X7 and adipose tissue accumulation have been reported from experiments using P2X7-deficient or diet-induced obesity mouse models (Sun et al., 2012; Beaucage et al., 2014; Buzzetti et al., 2016; Blasetti Fantauzzi et al., 2017; Giacovazzo et al., 2018) . Older male mice lacking P2X7 fed a standard chow diet were found to exhibit adipogenesis and abnormal adipose tissue distribution (Beaucage et al., 2014) . Nonetheless, conventional knockout methods would inevitably be confounded by the inactivation of cell types other than adipose tissues. On the other hand, knockdown of CD36 downregulated P2X7 and decreased lipid accumulation in 3T3-L1 cells (Gao et al., 2017) . The mRNA levels of P2X7 in epididymal WATs using a HFD mouse model were significantly increased after six weeks (Sun et al., 2012) . Of note, the increased P2X7 expression upon HFD does not necessarily mean activation of the P2X7 receptors and P2X7-mediated signaling pathways (Burnstock, 2006) . Therefore, the effect of P2X7 activation on adipogenic and browning genes warrant revisited during adipocyte differentiation. This study administered the selective P2X7 agonist BzATP and antagonist A438079 in the 3T3-L1 differentiation model to investigate the effects of P2X7 activation and inactivation on two sequential adipogenic factors, PPAR\u03b3 and C/EBP\u03b1. Whether cells were treated at D0/D2 or at stage 2 of adipocyte differentiation, BzATP enhanced the degree of lipid accumulation, intracellular TG formation, and extracellular glycerol release at D4. Although BzATP administration increased mRNA levels of PPAR\u03b3 at D2 and D4, it did not affect protein levels of PPAR\u03b3 and C/EBP\u03b1 at D2 or D4. C/EBP\u03b1 is an essential downstream adipogenic factor of PPAR\u03b3 (Ghaben and Scherer, 2019) . More detailed cascades should be elucidated for the role of P2X7 in these sequential adipogenic factors. In contrast, A438079 treatment at D0/D2 attenuated lipid accumulation, intracellular TG formation, and extracellular glycerol release at D4 without affecting protein and mRNA levels of PPAR\u03b3 and C/EBP\u03b1. Our results showed the effects of P2X7 on lipid accumulation and metabolism are independent of the expression of adipogenic factors; thus, other determinants such as browning genes should be explored. Given that browning of WAT inhibits lipid accumulation (Bartelt and Heeren, 2014) , obesity and HFD feeding, on the contrary, results in a WAT-like morphology in BAT called BAT whitening (Scheja and Heeren, 2019) . Obesogenic stimuli and HFD may also increase BAT thermogenic capacity to maintain body weight (Garc\u00eda-Ruiz et al., 2015) . The feeding-induced mesencephalic astrocytederived neurotrophic factor was recently shown to ameliorate diet-induced obesity by promoting adipose browning (Wu et al., 2021) . A study detected an increased gene expression of P2X7 not only in WAT but also in whitened BAT of diet-induced obesity and ob/ob mice. In contrast, the expression of P2X7 receptors upon 1-day cold exposure was not affected in adipocytes (Tian et al., 2020) . Nevertheless, no studies have investigated the association of P2X7 with browning genes during adipocyte differentiation.",

We demonstrated that the mRNA levels of PRDM16, PGC-1\u03b1, and UCP1 significantly increased at D4. BzATP administration exerted a concentration-dependent inhibition on the enhanced expression of PRDM16, PGC-1\u03b1, and UCP-1 at D4, compatible with the observed timing of P2X7 activation on lipid accumulation and metabolism. BzATP treatment at stage 2 of adipocyte differentiation consistently suppressed the mRNA levels of PRDM16, PGC-1\u03b1, and UCP1 initiated by stage 2 inducer insulin. Furthermore, BzATP administration during adipogenesis inhibited the protein and mRNA levels of SIRT3/5 at D4. BzATP treatment at stage 2 of adipocyte differentiation also suppressed the mRNA levels of SIRT3 and SIRT5 that were upregulated by insulin. SIRT3 and SIRT5 are located in mitochondria and have been implicated in upregulating the expression of browning genes (Shuai et al., 2019; Gao et al., 2020) . SIRT3 may promote brown fat thermogenesis by targeting upstream pathways of UCP1 (Sebaa et al., 2019) . SIRT5 was also required for brown adipocyte differentiation (Shuai et al., 2019) . Because our data revealed more apparent inhibitory effects on SIRT3/5 mRNA levels exerted by BzATP administration at stage 2 of adipocyte differentiation than at D0/D2, more experiments are needed to understand the detailed mechanisms through which P2X7 downregulates sirtuin gene expression along with the two-stage differentiation period.",
