The recognition of the association of psychiatric issues and distress with epilepsy has a long history (2) , and the need for assessing psychiatric comorbidities for an adequate therapy has received increasing awareness (3) . Whereas psychiatric disorders and depression in particular are considered as relevant comorbidities (4) , anxiety has been under-researched so far. Recent studies, however, suggest that in people with epilepsy, anxiety is at least as frequent as depression and dysphoria (5) . In recent years the different forms of anxiety in PWE and their pathophysiological and clinical appearance have been debated. These do not only differ in their temporal relation to seizures, but also in terms of their subjective quality and behavioral consequences (5, 6) . Thus, anxiety does not appear to be a uniform comorbidity of epilepsy but rather encompass a spectrum of manifestations. This spectrum also represents different pathogenetic mechanisms, including preictal prodromes possibly indicative of proictal alterations in excitability, direct neurobiological mechanisms related to the involvement of brain structures involved in emotional perception and regulation, early ictal anxiety reflecting a loss of control, and interictal anxiety, e.g., in expectation of further seizures, and social stigma manifesting as phobic behavior (7, 8) .",

This phobia may also refer to particular aspects of the seizure type, including loss of consciousness, motor phenomena, postural instability or autonomic signs with highly stigmatizing potential like drooling or enuresis. A resulting avoidance of social interactions is a particularly debilitating aspect, as it may persist over time and render the patient prone to loneliness and social isolation. \"Epileptic panic disorder\" is according to (5) a specific panic disorder that occurs in association with agoraphobia, an entity that is not described by other researchers, as far as we know. In our opinion this supposedly interictal form of anxiety could be an expression of ictal fear, thus, could be a part of the seizure semiology. The term \"fear of seizures\" (45) is quite extensive and refers to fears that follow from assumed preconditions or consequences of seizures, but also to the fear of losing control during a seizure or the unpredictability of the next seizure (anticipatory anxiety, see above).",
