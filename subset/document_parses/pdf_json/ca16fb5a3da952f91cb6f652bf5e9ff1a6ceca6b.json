Although the relevance of new technologies as strategic levers for crisis resolution has been widely debated before the pandemic, especially in the smart cities' context, how individuals have agreed to include the technological changes dictated by the pandemic in their daily interactions remains an open question. This paper aims at detecting citizens' sentiment toward technology before and after the emergence of the Covid-19 pandemic using Fuzzy Formal Concept Analysis (FFCA) to analyze a large corpus of tweets. Specifically, citizens' attitudes in five cities (Berlin, Dublin, London, Milan, and Madrid) were explored to extract and classify the key topics related to the degree of confidence, familiarity and approval of new technologies. The results shed light on the complex technology acceptance process and help managers identify the potential negative effects of smart technologies. In this way, the study enhances scholars' and practitioners' understanding of the strategies for enabling the use of technology within smart cities to manage the transformations introduced by the health emergency and guide citizens' behaviour.",

Smart cities are instrumented, interconnected, and intelligent urban areas (Harrison et al., 2010 ) that pursue shared growth through an integrated set of technologies that shape interactions between actors (Nam & Pardo, 2011) . In today's complex scenario, the role of the smart cities (and of their human resources and technology) as leading actors to face Covid-19 and future pandemics has been highlighted to challenge the global emergency. Even before the pandemic, smart technologies contributed to redesign the configuration of urban spaces. However, despite the revolutionary role of technology in smart cities, it has been noticed that intelligent tools do not automatically allow the achievement of well-being and innovation . Adopting technology could be necessary but not a sufficient condition for the effective readaptation and redefinition of the organizational models imposed by the desire to overcome the health emergency. Human interaction with technology is mediated by the political and institutional context in which the technologies are implemented (Kummitha, 2020) . The most recent contributions in literature highlight the need to explore how humane smart cities can help manage critical issues in the administration of smart cities through entrepreneurship, governance, and citizens' inclusion (Kitchin. 2015; . Moreover, individuals and organizations do not always own the right digital skills or the right propensity towards adopting new technologies (Azoulay & Jones, 2020) . Recent studies show that technology use may also have negative implications on users' wellbeing by determining stress toward applying ICT (information and communication technologies) to daily lives (Hauk et al., 2019; Nimrod, 2018) . To fully integrate technologies into their habits and routine, users should learn to manage technological tools. In addition, they should refocus their cognitive strategies to accomplish the cultural and social requirements related to their use.",

For these reasons, there is the need to explore whether and how individuals-citizens have agreed to include the technological changes dictated by the pandemic in their daily interactions by changing their habits and remodeling behaviours and attitudes. Detecting citizens' sentiment toward technology can permit to clarify the current directions of technology acceptance. Furthermore, it could support exploring the (social, economic, psychological) barriers to using technology and removing them to tackle the pandemic or other similar future emergencies by turning crises into opportunities for innovation and improvement of public services. As an economical, social, and political global epidemic, Covid-19 should be studied to support healthcare management and capture all the shades (e.g., distress, anxiety, fear) of its psychological and behavioural consequences (Abd-Alrazaq et al., 2020) . Recent research emphasizes the urgency to define the drivers of a digital mental health revolution that can support citizens in managing pandemics through e-services platforms and mobile applications. This study explores citizens' attitudes toward technology (and the technological transformation determined by through public sentiment analysis. In this way, the goal of the empirical research is to assess the degree of the propensity to use technology employing the variables and indicators of technology anxiety scale (Meuter et al., 2003; Tarafdar et al., 2007) , which operationalizes the key factors and stimuli that induce stress in the use of ICT. Thus, two research objectives are pursued: 1) to explore citizens' sentiment towards the adoption of technologies to challenge Covid-19 by detecting their degree of technology anxiety; 2) to reveal the change of attitude and behaviour toward technology by comparing the different variations of technology anxiety before and after the advent of the pandemic. The empirical research analyses the different citizens' sentiment in selected European smart cities, of which-following Brexit-four are European Union (EU) member-states (Berlin, Dublin, London, Milan, and Madrid) . In detail, the attitude toward the changes induced by Covid-19 is analyzed by detecting citizens' sentiment towards a series of topics related to the use of the new digital tools, facilities, and services from an emotional and linguistical point of view in the pre-and post-pandemic period. The five cities have been selected based on their size, level of smartness, and strategic influence in Europe and, thus, based on their representativeness of contemporary urban trends.",

            "text": "For about twenty years, the concept of \"smart city\" has received increasing attention in urban planning and governance (Nam & Pardo, 2011; . As broadly discussed in the literature, a smart city can be defined as complex sets of technology (infrastructures of hardware and software), people (creativity, diversity, and education), and institutions (governance and policy) (Nam & Pardo, 2011) . Smart cities should be explored according to an all-inclusive perspective that does not overrate the technological dimension but that considers the economic, social, governmental, and environmental dimensions (Stratigea, 2012; Albino et al., 2015; Neirotti et al., 2014) as a set of integrated enabling factors for urban and service improvement. In such a scenario, smart cities can create a fertile environment to drive innovation from a technological, managerial, and organizational point of view by fostering environmental and social wellbeing (Karvonen et al., 2018; Polese, 2021) . Therefore, creating effective and really \"smart\" cities can be considered a key lever for community welfare. Smart city networks can provide suitable instruments to empower data sharing in outbreaks or disasters, leading to better global understanding and management of emergencies (Allam & Jones, 2020) . The development of more efficient and widespread smart city initiatives can improve the way critical data is retrieved, processed, stored, and disseminated, potentially improving the detection and mitigation of outbreaks while reducing the execution time when taking critical actions (Costa & Peixoto, 2020) . Smart city approaches can drive individuals to use data and knowledge on vulnerable groups and poor urban areas to support the social and economic crisis (S\u00f6derstr\u00f6m, 2020) . Accordingly, the increasing use of ICTs has improved the internet of things applications in healthcare and citizen participation for epidemic detection during Covid-19 (Giffinger et al., 2007; Abusaada et al., 2020) . In this way, the multiple technological points and their real-time ability to collect and share data can significantly improve well-being and quality of life by strengthening citizens' involvement in policymaking (Vanolo, 2016) and generating added value and crisis response capacity in the urban context .",

Technology anxiety is defined as a complex set of emotions such as nervousness, uncertainty, and fears associated with using and learning to use technology. This concept is related to apprehension about the negative consequences of using technology, such as losing important data or making mistakes (Compeau & Higgins, 1995) . It involves both the (objective) lack of technological skills and the (subjective) low confidence in their abilities to use specialized tools. In addition, it can be related to the user's state of mind about general technology tools (Meuter et al., 2003) or to hidden social and psychological factors, such as cost concerns, dependency concerns, trust in technology providers and organizations adopt technology, privacy concerns.",

Hence, differently from the concepts of technostress (Ayyagari et al., 2011; Tarafdar, Gupta, & Turel, 2013) or general computer anxiety (Heinssen et al., 1987; Tekinarslan, 2008) , this construct defines a temporary state deriving from environmental turbulences (such as the advent of global emergencies) and permits to observe in-depth the individual psychological reactions to technology rather than analyzing a more \"general\" behavioural aspect. For this reason, it seems to be a more easily generalizable concept that can also be used outside the business context. Moreover, technology anxiety allows the exploration of the development of negative emotions and fear as consequences of the introduction of a given technology by evaluating the emotional state of individuals and not the acceptance and use of technology per se (e.g., such as the technology acceptance model, Davis, 1989) . Thus, investigating the degree of technology anxiety in contemporary cities can shed light on the different emotional shades of public sentiment and citizens' behaviors.",

            "text": "Despite the increasing diffusion of the analysis of the opportunities and challenges in adopting technology to face pandemics in smart cities, two main issues emerged from the brief overview conducted above. Firstly, there is the need to explore the weight of human capital in the use of ICT: citizens' digital culture, their attitude toward technology (Hollands, 2008; Mora et al., 2017) , and their propensity to change their lives through technology-mediated interactions (Kunzmann, 2020) . Secondly, future research must shed light on the negative effects that technology can have on citizens' wellbeing and identify the obstacles of the acceptance and adhesion to smart technologies and of their advantageous application (Hollands, 2008; Hauk et al., 2019; Mora et al., 2017; Nimrod, 2018) . Therefore, the true turning point for the resolution of a pandemic would also concern citizens' behaviour by referring to their acceptance of technological changes, their willingness to use technology to reframe their lives, and in the removal of psychological barriers (privacy concerns, perception of inability, etc.) for employing technology successfully and solving the socio-economic crisis introduced by a public health emergency. For this reason, albeit the relevant literature highlighted the potential of smart technologies during the pandemic, contemporary debate on smart cities should explore how relationships between people and technologies can be redesigned to identify the most adequate strategies to involve citizens in the active resolution of the crisis and global emergency and to co-develop innovative solutions and social changes, which still represents an open question. To address the first gap identified in literature on smart cities (the lack of studies on the key role of users'/citizens' attitude as an enabling factor of wise use of technology, cf. paragraph 2.1), this study explores the public sentiment of citizens during the public health emergency as a predictor of their potential behaviour and its possible variations. Despite the increasing diffusion of research that examines the public reaction to the contemporary health emergency, a deep understanding of the most common themes, concerns, and sentiments related to the perception of Coronavirus has not been achieved yet. This study analyzes citizens' sentiment shared through Twitter, one of the most popular microblogging platforms, with over 350 million users and 152 million daily users who produce 500 million tweets a day (Statista, 2020) . Microblogging is a quick communication means that can capture tweeters' perception at any moment and can help to catch insights into their attitudes and opinion on the usefulness and usability of specific smart-city services and applications (Oulasvirta et al., 2010) .",

Therefore, through the co-occurrence of words like \"lack\", \"knowledge\", \"learn\", a lack of self-confidence in technology adoption can be noticed (Anger Knowledge Learn Lack Difficulty Want Care) and a negative user's state of mind regarding the ability and willingness to use technology-related tools can be observed. The Dubliners in the sample also express the difficulty in using technology for private life and the perception of asymmetry and unbalance in the detection of technological power and skills (Anger Hard Business Work Power). This finding is in line with citizens' anxieties about the centralization of the profits deriving from smart services and the lack of social usefulness (Lytras et al., 2021) . The shortage of self-confidence to employ technologies is one of the key concerns identified in extant empirical research. The perception of inability is an obstacle to adequate knowledge sharing and skills acquisition (P\u00e9rez-delHoyo & Mora, 2019), which can be considered the crucial factors for the success of a smart city .",

Thus, technological anxiety is related to an individual dimension before the advent of Covid-19; this negative attitude can lead citizens to conceive smart technologies as a \"luxury\", or a means to enrich the powerful men. The rage against technology expressed by the Italian citizens is related to the distrust toward society and public management of technologies and the non-acceptance of changes (Anger Care Public People Change Milan). Resistance to technology and the inability to accept new technologies (and the modification they bring in users' lives) are among the most assessed barriers to technology acceptance (Davis, 1989; Bhattacherjee et al., 2007) . In previous studies, resistance towards technology is considered a key determinant of technology anxiety. Moreover, it can predict potential users' perception and behaviour (Lytras et al., 2021) and discard technology.",

For this reason, the low significance associated with its coefficient can be explained through the presence of this issue in the two times periods, which determines the almost total independence from the dependent variable (period).

Psychological factors can motivate users to adopt smart-cities services and help individuals achieve their personal and professional tasks (Macke et al., 2019) . The psychological impact of technology is widely debated in the literature. For example, perceived self-efficacy, self-confidence, and self-esteem are considered threatening factors for developing technology anxiety (Bandura, 1986) and the decrease of the sense of control over daily activities. Therefore, reducing anxiety can increase the sense of control and make the events more predictable by decreasing the feeling of risk. One of the effective strategies to reduce citizens' perception of the inability to use technology is to increase digital skills and culture. For this reason, the development of digital competencies (for children, practitioners, urban managers, and citizens as a whole) has been settled as one of the priorities of the European Digital Agenda 2020. Digital citizenship, as the exertion of active engagement in the development of cities and communities, has been promoted over the last years in international smart cities to address the lack of digital skills in students, citizens, and public administration workers. For instance, UK Government is encouraging the implementation of digital citizenship as a mandatory subject in schools. Similarly, Common sense, a British non-profit organization, is devoted to providing services for the improvement of kids' and families' education by offering them trustworthy information and the right competencies and attitude to thrive in the digital era. Fear and uncertainty are other recognized enabling factors of technology anxiety. If anxiety is related to the lack of control, fear stems from an emotional state of fright that leads users to perceive a threat in their lives.",

Moreover, the adoption of a collaborative mindset based on data can be fostered through the constant sharing of information, technical experiences, and knowledge between experts and civil society to involve citizens in the active use of technology and the proposition of innovative policies for the territory. Open data projects and hackathons seem to be useful practices to raise citizens' involvement in a better and more acknowledged use of technology and the co-development of innovative solutions. For instance, the open data hackathon at the municipality of Livorno held in 2018 aimed at increasing citizens' digital culture and simplifying the access and use of data (geographic, geo-referenced, or geo-referenced data) to make every actor understand how to extract relevant content from data.

It has been demonstrated that the primary cause of failure in technology implementation is the absence of a totalizing digital culture rather than the structural characteristics of technology (LaValle et al., 2011; Ross et al., 2013) . In the sample of tweets, a positive attitude to the use of data for cities growth and innovation has been revealed. A data-driven culture is defined in the literature (McAfee & Brynjolffson 2012) as an approach to decision-making based on the relevance of data (and of the insights extracted from it) as a strategic asset to undertake more effective decisions. Extant research shows that the enhancement of digital literacy (Axelsson et al., 2010; Wiig, 2016) can enable citizens' engagement in cities decision-making by implementing a series of digital strategies and smart projects that can create an ecosystem of citizen-centric services. For instance, the activity \"Smart Polis2020\", launched by the Puglia Region in 2019, aims at creating a new version of smart cities that involves citizens in the design and implementation of policies. Smart polis can be intended as a physical and geographical place built on a network of new technologies, but also as a relational space \"delimited\" by cultural, social, political, and economic connections which, if exploited appropriately, can permit users to co-create innovative services and satisfy individual and community's needs.",

The national culture and the political context can influence citizens' attitudes and behaviours toward technology and can prevent the acceptance of technological changes (Harris & Davison, 1999) .

Moreover, the four macro-dimensions detected in the framework can be generalized to smart cities contexts. They can be broadened to analyze the key levers to reduce the digital divide in smart communities (Li et al., 2019) and smart villages in which, according to extant research (Tran et al., 2017; Yu et al., 2017) , there is the need to reveal some strategies to support underprivileged people or individuals that do not have the right skills to use technology. By clarifying the means to reduce technology anxiety, the study can suggest how to enhance citizens' perceived usefulness of technology to challenge pandemics and foster the restarting of the economy and social activities. Policy-makers should highlight the potential benefits of technology, such as improved efficiency and performance of healthcare, mobility, and public services in general. In the EU, as discussed above, several attempts are made to coordinate the policies on smart cities through a series of initiatives on sustainability and digital culture (Agenda 2020; SDGs, etc.); however, the power of decision remains at the city level, and this can prevent a full harmonization of the strategies across the different nations. The discussion of some international cities that can be considered best practices in implementing smart projects advances the first step for applying the framework to other urban contexts by confirming the generalizability of the four dimensions. In this way, it can be noticed that citizens' inclusion and digital literacy are relevant issues that do not apply only to urban contexts and should be addressed to solve societal, economic, technological, and political problems worldwide. Thus, a new mindset for education that goes beyond the urban context is spreading to pursue the objectives of technological access and digital literacy for children, students, teachers, policy-makers, practitioners, and managers to build a shared digital world (Johnson et al., 2021) . The categorization of the main determinants of the technology anxiety developed after the advent of the pandemic can be intended as a starting point for further qualitative and quantitative research to explore the drivers of the change in citizen's sentiment before and after the spread of Covid-19. First, a mixed-method approach can enrich and extend the framework proposed in the study through observations and the administration of semi-structured interviews to a sample of citizens to identify a most detailed classification of the key indicators of technology anxiety. Then, by transforming the indicators into items, a measurement scale of technology anxiety can be tested and validated through quantitative analysis based on regression and structural equation modelling. A limitation of the study can be found in the discrepancy between online behaviour and offline behaviour and the difficulty in exploring psychological characteristics through social media analysis. However, it is acknowledged that users currently perceive their online profiles as an extension of the self rather than a separate entity, revealing their real psychological features. Moreover, the technique employed (and actual data mining and machine learning techniques) can ensure a great level of accuracy to predict characteristics based on online data (Gouda & Hasan, 2019) .",
