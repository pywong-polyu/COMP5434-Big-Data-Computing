A scoping literature was conducted and included articles from 1980 to present. Since 2004, major growth and advancements in peer support have occurred from the development of new specializations to training, certification, reimbursement mechanisms, competency standards and fidelity assessment. Peer support is now a service offered across the world and considered an indispensable mental health service. As the field continues to evolve and develop, peer support is emerging as a standard of practice throughout various, diverse settings and shows potential to impact clinical outcomes for service users throughout the globe. While these efforts have enhanced the professionalism of the peer workforce, hopefully this has enhanced the positive elements of these services and not diluted them.",

Peer support/ peer-supported services include inpatient, outpatient, digital, and community-based services for people with mental health conditions and/or substance use challenges by individuals who identify as experiencing similar lived experiences [1, 6] . More than 30,000 peer support specialists (also called: peer providers, peers, peer specialists, peer supporters, peer mentors, peer navigators, certified peer support specialists) in the United States offer Medicaid reimbursable services in 43 states [7] [8] [9] . The spread of peer support and its' growth in evidence related to the effectiveness for service users [2] [3] [4] , have led to major advancements. As such, an update to the seminal article on peer support by Solomon [1] , which was published over 17 years ago, is warranted.",

However, today it is more about supportive service provision based on experiential knowledge delivered to service users by those sharing a mental health challenge. Thus, rather than being mutually offered, where the intent was to benefit both parties to some extent, currently the purpose of peer support services emphasizes assisting those served, with benefit to the deliverer being a secondary gain, as noted by peers workers themselves [10] . Therefore, the definition needs to be modified from mutually offered and provided to being delivered by mutual agreement.",

Consequently, the service is more structured today, rather than primarily providing informal support, and may involve the delivery of evidence-based interventions, such as self-management programs including Wellness Recovery Action Planning [11] , developed by a peer, and Illness Management and Recovery [12] , which was developed by professionals and is delivered by both peers and non-peers [13] . Other programs provided have been developed by peers such as emotional CPR [14] or co-produced by peers and non-peer scientists such as PeerTECH [15, 16] .

Thus, the concept of lived experience expertise goes beyond just mental health per se to include living with chronic medical conditions and having experienced forensic and child welfare involvement and being a parent with a mental illness [18] . This has led to specialized chronic disease self-management programs delivered by peers, such as Health and Recovery Peer program (HARP) [19, 20] and peer navigators to enhance health and health care utilization [21] , wellness coaches [22, 23] , and employment of forensic peer specialists.

However, there is a need for slight modifications to the definition to reflect these important advancements. Thus, the updated definition of peer support is social and/or emotional support that combines expertise from lived experience that is delivered with mutual agreement by persons who self-identify as having or had mental health as well as other social, psychological and medical challenges to service users sharing similar challenges to bring about self-determined personal change to the service user. Self-identification is important today given designated positions and reimbursement requirements. The definition is not confined to any particular mode of service delivery, but leaves the modality unspecified. This definition is consistent with the definition of the role of peer support worker defined by Mead et al. [6] that is used globally as \"offering and receiving help, based on shared understanding, respect and mutual empowerment between people in similar situations\".",

Although these categories remain relevant today, it is apparent that there is overlap among some categories (e.g., peer delivered and peer employees) and mixes mode of delivery with support types (e.g., internet self-help versus self-help); therefore, this categorization requires refinement. Swarbrick and Schmidt [25] offered a taxonomy that maintains the integrity of this classification with enhanced mutuality of categories: peer-delivered self-help, peer-run services, peer partnerships, and peers in recovery as employees. For purposes of this article, these categories will be utilized. However, some of these categories have been greatly expanded in terms of settings, substantive content and mode of delivery, particularly in the use of technology, compared to an earlier time. All of which will be elaborated upon below.",

Peer self-help is more commonly delivered in a group format, such groups are defined as \"voluntary small group structures for mutual aid in the accomplishment of a specific purpose\u2026 usually formed by peers who have come together for mutual assistance in satisfying a common need, overcoming a common handicap or life-disrupting problem, and bringing about desired social and/or personal change\" [26] . This is the fastest growing category of peer support services in low and middle-income countries. Peer self-help groups for mental health challenges gained increasing prominence in the era of deinstitutionalization, as people were frequently discharged into communities with limited community-based mental health services and many had negative experiences with professional mental health services, particularly state psychiatric hospitals. Thus, these support services were more acceptable, feasible, and accessible to people with mental health challenges. Self-help groups cover just about every mental health-related challenge/condition and co-morbid physical health or social health challenge (e.g., loneliness). The most noted ones relevant to the current topic that offer global self-help services, some exist for many years, are Recovery International, Schizophrenics Anonymous, Emotions Anonymous, Depression and Bipolar Support Alliance, and the Hearing Voices Network. Recently, self-help groups have arisen to meet the growing demand for additional services, including those that focus on mental health and physical health challenges and aging with a serious mental illness such as the COAPS Facebook group.",

These self-help groups are not restricted to location, size, or time. Generally, these groups are informal and facilitated by untrained, often voluntary, peers [3] , but may be facilitated or co-facilitated by a professional (hybrid self-help groups) [31] . While the use of technology for support groups has been around for about 20 years, they are now much more pervasive and sophisticated than previously. At the time of the original article, the technology that was used was more listservs, bulletin boards or email, and very limited, if at all, plus synchronous communication was only possible through a telephone. Currently, synchronous communication is readily available via platforms like Zoom, What's App, or Facetime.

Twenty years later, 43 states now reimburse for peer support services [8, 9] and have developed peer support certification to meet Medicaid standards for qualifications and training. Hence, these peers are often referred to as certified peer specialists.

Since 2005, there have been advancements in digital peer support including smartphone apps, web-based platforms, and social media tools [3] . Soon after 2005, Asia, Europe, and Australia developed digital peer support programs financed through grant-funded positions or commercial health insurers [3] . Many peers in the United States own or have a smartphone provided to them by their employer for business use [16] . The COVID-19 outbreak and the subsequent National Emergency Declaration [55] allowed for many states with Medicaid reimbursable peer support services to offer Medicaid reimbursable digital peer support through telehealth. Globally the United Kingdom's response to COVID resulted in a National Emergency Declaration in Europe [56] , followed by the National Emergency Declaration in Canada, both of which allowed for many provinces and territories to offer reimbursable digital peer support services issued under national safety and privacy laws [57] .",

As noted previously, the pervasiveness of consumerism, increasing distrust of professionals and the growing value placed on lived experience to enhancing access to health care has resulted in the rise of similar positions in the medical care system, specifically Community Health Workers (CHW). However, it is important to note that they are not peer support employees as CHWs lack self-identification as having a lived experience of a mental health challenge [58] . As defined in the Affordable Care Act, a community health worker (CHW) is an individual based in the community who promotes health or nutrition through liaison activities between health care agencies and the community, provides social assistance and guidance to community residents, enhances communication between residents and health care providers, offers health and nutritional education that is culturally and linguistically appropriate, supports referrals and follow-up services, and proactively identifies and advocates for the enrollment of eligible individuals in covered health service programs [59] . Although CHW share similar positive benefits and outcomes as peer supporters; there are important distinctions between the two positions. A CHW is an individual with little to no formal clinical training, but are members of the community in which they work with medical patients who share similar ethnic and racial characteristics by providing support for medical-related issues such as long-term medication management, rides to and from appointments [8] . Different terms are used to describe CHWs, including patient navigators, peer whole health coach/wellness coach, and promotors. Unlike peers, they do not have a mental health challenge or for that matter do not share the common lived experience of a medical challenge, but rather share cultural and community characteristics.",

While these continue to be relevant, Fortuna et al. [65] expands on this theoretical basis by the addition of self -determination theory [66] . Self-determination theory proposes that when psychological needs for autonomy/control, self-sufficiency, competence, and connectedness to others are met, then individuals strive for continuing psychological development in terms of well-being and recovery [66] . As the consumer movement has highlighted the importance of choice in treatment and relationship to others like themselves, this naturally extends to the service approach of the peer support workforce. Peers regard autonomy as a key objective in their work with people with a lived experience of a mental health challenge and collaboratively assist in fulfilling their self-determined goals [65] .",

Peers help other peers to enhance their power so they are able to obtain essential resources, and attain control over their life to successfully achieve their own personal goals. They offer strategies for and information about accessing needed resources, therefore helping to critically enhance awareness and appraisal of their environment enabling them to more effectively participate in decisions relevant to their own well-being [68] .",

Since the original publication in 2004, there has been a number of systematic reviews of peer provided services (e.g., [2, [69] [70] [71] [72] [73] , and specialized ones on digital peer support [3] ,on one-to-one peer support [4] and another on low-and middle income countries [74] . Reviewers have had different criteria for inclusion and exclusion, and studies have been diversified with regard to designs (i.e. experimental, quasi-experimental, etc.) and in outcomes and measures. Reviews with more rigorous designs employing meta-analyses have found less impact [75] . All have found some positive effects, but most reviews have noted small to moderate effects. A consistent challenge has been the lack of methodological rigor in studies (i.e., lack of randomized designs) [2, 3] , which has precluded reviews from establishing peer support services as achieving an evidence-based practice status.",

The issuance produced a list of the value of peer support or from peer support specialists service provision. Due to the lack of consistent methodological rigor, we highlight these outcomes as promising to the field. These outcomes included increased self-esteem and efficacy, sense of control, empowerment, hope, belief in bringing about change in their lives, sense of belonging, social support, engagement in self-management, services, treatment and community; and improved social functioning, quality of life and life satisfaction. Further, peer support also resulted in decreases in hospitalizations, self-stigma, psychotic symptoms, depression, substance use and fewer feelings of social isolation. Most relevant research usually determined some positive results, although they may not have found support for all outcomes hypothesized. Clearly, not all who engage in peer support services will receive all of these benefits, each has a chance for some benefit from receipt of peer support services, although there was a lack of consistency across study outcomes.",

Further, being a peer employee helps to challenge self-stigma, to engage in one's own recovery and self-discovery, to enhance their social support network, find positive means to spend their time, and gainful employment therefore, achieving a better quality of life. Moreover, they are offered opportunities for professional growth in terms of learning positive work habits and job skills, as well as having the potential for developing and achieving career goals.

Furthermore, the teaching of medical, psychiatric, and social health self-management may impact inappropriate service use from the system.

These attitude changes help to combat societal stigma of persons with mental health conditions. Peer support services are possibly more likely to be used by those who eschew the traditional mental health services, such as those who are homeless, who have had negative interactions with the system, or for other reasons feel alienated from and mistrustful of professional services. Peer supporters help to engage or re-engage these individuals into the professional treatment system, are more inclined to do outreach to those in need and to make referrals to self-help groups.

Although these elements remain relevant, there are now guidance and standards for peer employees that are up to date in their conceptualization and more appropriate as standards. SAMHSA issued competences for peer workers in behavioral health services in 2015 and in 2016 Chinman et al. engaged in preliminary efforts for the development of a fidelity measure for peers. These will both be discussed below. It is also important to note that the proliferation of peers and their expansion in the past two decades such that now even accrediting bodies such as the Commission on Accreditation of Rehabilitation Facilities (CARF) has developed standards to include peer support specialists in the workforce [77] . For example, human resource policies and practices within an organization need to promote integration of the peer workforce in the following areas, including responsive hiring practices, acceptance of lived experience expertise in place of formal credentials, and job structures offering opportunities for advancement.",
