            "text": "To provide an interpretable summary of the impact on mortality of the COVID-19 pandemic we estimate weekly and annual life expectancies at birth in Spain and its regions. Methods: We used daily death count data from the Spanish Daily Mortality Surveillance System, MoMo, and death counts from 2018, and population on July 1 st , 2019 by region (CCAA), age groups, and sex from the Spanish National Statistics Institute. We estimated weekly and annual (2019 and 2020*, the shifted annual calendar period up to May 17 th , 2020) life expectancies at birth as well as their differences over a short period of time. Results: Weekly life expectancies at birth in Spain were lower in weeks 11-20, 2020 compared to the same weeks in 2019. This drop in weekly life expectancy was especially strong in weeks 13 and 14 (March 23 rd to April 5 th ), with national declines ranging between 6.1 and 7.6 years and maximum regional weekly declines of up to 15 years in Madrid. Annual life expectancy differences between 2019 and 2020* also reflected an overall drop in annual life expectancy of 0.8 years for both men and women. These drops ranged between 0 years in several regions (e.g. Canary and Balearic Islands) to 2.7 years among men in Madrid. Conclusions: Weekly and annual life expectancy are easy to interpret measures for understanding the heterogeneity of mortality patterns across Spanish regions. Weekly life expectancy is a valuable indicator of the immediate intensity of health impacts from the pandemic. This sensitive indicator is also useful for understanding disparities and communicating the gravity of the situation because differences are expressed in intuitive year units.",

This has put health systems in struggling and challenging situations (5) , and thus potentially leading to increases in morbidity and mortality indirectly related to COVID-19. For example, some excess mortality could result from healthcare avoidance, from a delay in treatment, or from insufficient care for other urgent conditions resulting from a reduced capacity to treat other medical emergencies. Other kinds of mortality may be temporarily reduced, such as deaths from acute respiratory conditions related to air pollution, or traffic accidents, but those mortality reductions may be outweighed by excesses. While total excess mortality and total number of COVID-19 deaths provide some measure of the impact of the pandemic within populations, their interpretation is not always straightforward, and comparisons between populations can be challenging.",

The most common misunderstanding is to treat it as a forecasted expectancy. In monitoring mortality patterns in non-crisis times, annual life expectancy is a standard indicator because it accounts for differences in age-specific mortality, and it is expressed in intuitive year units, making it easy to grasp and compare across populations and over time. The current pandemic, with fast mortality increases in specific weeks, makes it useful to shorten the calendar reference period of mortality rates in order to measure life expectancy changes. When calculated over short time intervals in this way, life expectancy should be understood as an annualized summary index of mortality. This index is much more volatile than standard period life expectancy calculated over a year, and it should be reported alongside traditional calendar-year life expectancy measures, possibly with shifting calendar reference windows. A few studies that have documented life expectancy declines have found notable declines in annual life expectancy in highly affected Spanish and Italian regions, Madrid and Bergamo (6, 7) , and declines in weekly life expectancy in Sweden (8) .",

            "text": "Furthermore, the effects of delayed care of chronic conditions, cumulative anxiety, alcohol consumption, and other factors during the pandemic may contribute to elevated mortality in the coming months. However, mortality may also decrease in the coming months due to the mortality selection of frail individuals which usually occurs after severe flu episodes. That is, the COVID-19 pandemic has been more fatal among elderly individuals with pre-existing health conditions (14, 15) as well as individuals residing in nursing homes (15, 16) . Therefore, it is plausible that some individuals who would have been expected to die in the remaining part of the year have already died, which could lead to mortality reductions in the second half of 2020. Other populations seem to be as affected or more affected by COVID-19 than Spain. For instance, the UK is at the time of writing the country with the highest relative excess mortality (17) , and important geographical inequalities exist as well, with London leading the negative All rights reserved.

These changes in life expectancy correlated strongly with the prevalence of antibodies against SARS-COV-2. Our estimates of the 2-3 years drop in annual life expectancy for Madrid, the most severely hit region, are slightly lower than similar estimates from the Italian province of Bergamo (7). However, this comparison should be taken cautiously as the time frame and pandemic timing differed between studies, and life expectancy was compared to 2017 in the Bergamo study whereas we compared with 2019 levels.

In contrast, the average annual increase in life expectancy in Spain increased on average two months per year from 2009 to 2019.
