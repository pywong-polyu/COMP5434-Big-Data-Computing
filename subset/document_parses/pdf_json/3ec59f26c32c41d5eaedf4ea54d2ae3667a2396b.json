            "text": "Several registry studies from high socio-demographic Index (SDI) countries have shown that COVID-19 illness in patients with hematological malignancies is associated with worse outcomes [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] . There are limited data regarding the outcomes of such patients from low SDI countries [7] . To understand the real-world outcome of COVID-19 patients with hematologic malignancies(HM) from India, the COVID-19 Hematologic Cancer Registry of India (CHCRI) started collecting data from patients of all ages with a current or history of HM and a laboratory-confirmed (positive RT-PCR or antigen test) COVID-19 infection from ten tertiary referral centers across India. These patients either attended the outdoor clinic or were admitted to these hospitals with COVID-19 illness. The current analysis describes the outcome of patients reported to the registry from March 21st, 2020, till March 20th, 2021. Data were submitted via individual case entry through an online CHCRI case record form maintained by Hematology Cancer Consortium(HCC). The cases from each site were not necessarily consecutive, and the denominator of cases at each site is not known. Data collection was retrospective from 21st March 2020 till 30th October 2020 and prospective from 1st November 2020 till 20th March 2021. The status of all patients was updated on May 1st, 2021. Double entries, nonhematologic diagnoses, and entries with incomplete outcome information were excluded from the analysis. The local Institutional Review Boards (IRB) approved the study at each center, and the study procedures complied with the Helsinki declaration. Any patient who received any form of therapy for the HM in the past 4 weeks was defined to be on active anticancer therapy. A delay in planned anticancer therapy by more than 2 weeks was considered as \"interruption\", while the use of lower dose chemotherapy was considered \"de-escalation\". COVID-19 severity was classified as mild: asymptomatic for COVID-19-related symptoms (asymptomatic positive) or SpO2 > 94% on room air; moderate: SpO2 ranging from 90 to 94% on room air; Severe: SpO2 < 90% on room air. The disease severity was analyzed using univariate and multivariable penalized logistic regression analysis. The Kaplan Meier method was used for time-to-event outcomes, and the Log-rank test was used to compare two survival curves. The variables significant at p-value < 0.05 were included in the multivariable Cox regression model. Table 1 shows the baseline study characteristics and mortality among the three COVID-19 severity categories. Among the 565 patients of COVID-19 with HM reported to the registry over 12 months, 379 (67.1)% patients had mild COVID-19 while 71 (12.6%) and 115 (20.5%) patients had moderate and severe COVID-19, respectively. Seventy-six percent of these patients were admitted to the hospital (Supplementary Fig. 1, 2) . The mean age of the whole cohort was 41 (SD\u00b119) years, and the male: female ratio was 2.2:1. In the entire cohort, the three common diagnoses in order of prevalence were Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL), lymphoma, and Multiple Myeloma. Most of the patients (66%), had COVID-19 within six months of being diagnosed with HM. 30% of patients were in remission for their HM at the time of COVID-19 diagnosis. 76% of patients were receiving active anticancer therapy when COVID-19 was diagnosed. 50.5% of patients received steroids, and 15.2% had received monoclonal antibodies in the previous 4 weeks as a part of their treatment for HM.",

            "text": "On Table 2 ). The study presents registry-based data of patients with HM and COVID-19 from one of the worst-hit low SDI countries in the initial 12 months. Several registry-based retrospective studies are describing the short-term follow-up (up to 6 weeks) outcomes of patients with HM and COVID-19 [5, 6, [8] [9] [10] [11] . Most of these studies are from regions with well-equipped healthcare resources and predominantly include patients with severe COVID-19 (>70% in most studies). The mortality in hospitalized/ severe COVID-19 in the high SDI countries exceeds 30% (Supplementary Table 3 ). We noted a mortality rate of 20.5% in our whole cohort that had 67% patients with mild COVID-19. The mortality was~8%, 16%, and 65% in patients with mild, moderate, and severe COVID-19, respectively. Age > 60 years is a common factor affecting mortality in the current as well as other studies. However, concerning the risk of developing severe COVID-19, any age >20 years was found significant in the current study. Most studies concur that patients with Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML), lymphoma, and Multiple Myeloma have an increased risk for COVID-19 mortality [6, 9, 11, 12] . In the current study, AML was associated with an increased risk of mortality, while low-grade lymphoma including Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia and Multiple Myeloma were only associated with an increased risk of severe COVID-19. A quarter of AML patients died within a month of COVID-19 diagnosis; the risk of death in multiple myeloma patients was uniform over the six-month follow-up period (Supplementary Table 4 ). In the current study, the use of steroids or monoclonal antibodies as a part of treatment for underlying malignancy was not associated with either COVID-19 severity or mortality. These results have been contradictory in lymphoma patients in different studies [12, 13] . With regards to outcomes in post-HCT patients, our study concurs with the CIBMTR and EBMT studies, which also showed an increased risk of COVID-19 mortality post-HCT [14, 15] .",

The true denominator of cases from a given site was not known. Though treatment interruption or de-escalation was not prospectively captured in a fraction of patients, the study does indicate the need to keep the interruptions/de-escalations to a minimum to avoid the increased risk of mortality, specifically in those patients not in remission. The strengths of the study include a large data set from one of the severely COVID-19 hit, low SDI regions [16] . Additionally, this study comprises broad hematological malignancies including leukemia, lymphoma, and myeloma, with a relatively longer followup post-COVID-19. As the study included patients from India up to March 20, 2021, most of the patients were unvaccinated, and therefore, the impact of vaccination in this population was not analysed. In conclusion, the study highlights the high mortality due to COVID-19 in patients with HM especially AML and post-HCT patients. More than one billion population in India is already vaccinated and it will be interesting to know the impact of the COVID-19 vaccine on the outcome of cancer patients in the future.",
