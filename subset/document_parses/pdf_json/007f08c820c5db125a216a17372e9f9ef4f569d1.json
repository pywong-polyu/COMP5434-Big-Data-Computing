Orthopaedic subspecialty rotations were stopped in March 2020, and trainee involvement in theatres was reduced to make way for consultant-delivered procedures while also making sure that fewer individuals were exposed to these aerosol-generating procedures. Finally, there is an ongoing postponement of elective cases. All this is occurring against a background of many emerging technically challenging techniques (e.g., arthroscopy and navigated surgery) and a reduction in theatre exposure secondary to the European Working Time Directive (Fitzgerald and Caesar 2012) . Regardless of these disruptions, the Joint Committee on Surgical Training (JCST) surgical curriculum in the UK has maintained the minimum number of certain index procedures that are deemed crucial for all orthopaedic surgeons to formally complete their training.",

The instructivist pedagogy of VR, with an absence of crucial personal interactions, runs against experiential learning theories, which highlight the importance of peer and multidisciplinary learning. The loss of this sensitive interaction renders VRBT incapable of developing skills that centre on communication and analysis, key requirements of the surgical curriculum (ISCP: Intercollegiate surgical curriculum programme 2020). We must therefore consider that VRBT cannot truly fully replace the \"hands on\" learning of the OR but could become integrated as an adjunct to theatre learning, for example with femoral neck guidewire placement. This would be supplemented with self-reflection and reflective practice, integral aspects for the professional development of orthopaedic trainees (Cruess 2006) . Altogether, given these aforementioned deficiencies, the future development of this technology could see the incorporation of \"group\" VRBT, whereby individuals could communicate and interact together on a case to truly mimic the multidisciplinary nature of the theatre environment.",
