            "text": "The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a highly contagious virus that underlies the current COVID-19 pandemic. SARS-CoV-2 is thought to disable various features of host immunity and cellular defense. The SARS-CoV-2 nonstructural protein 1 (Nsp1) is known to inhibit host protein translation and could be a target for antiviral therapy against COVID-19. However, how SARS-CoV-2 circumvents this translational blockage for the production of its own proteins is an open question. Here, we report a bipartite mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 Nsp1 which operates by: (1) hijacking the host ribosome via direct interaction of its Cterminal domain (CT) with the 40S ribosomal subunit and (2) specifically lifting this inhibition for SARS-CoV-2 via a direct interaction of its N-terminal domain (NT) with the 5' untranslated region (5' UTR) of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA. We show that while Nsp1-CT is sufficient for binding to 40S and inhibition of host protein translation, the 5' UTR of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA removes this inhibition by binding to Nsp1-NT, suggesting that the Nsp1-NT-UTR interaction is incompatible with the Nsp1-CT-40S interaction. Indeed, lengthening the linker between Nsp1-NT and Nsp1-CT of Nsp1 progressively reduced the ability of SARS-CoV-2 5' UTR to escape the translational inhibition, supporting that the incompatibility is likely steric in nature. The short SL1 region of the 5' UTR is required for viral mRNA translation in the presence of Nsp1. Thus, our data provide a comprehensive view on how Nsp1 switches infected cells from host mRNA translation to SARS-CoV-2 mRNA translation, and that Nsp1 and 5' UTR may be targeted for anti-COVID-19 therapeutics.",

The mScarlet reporter used an expression vector that contains the cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter and 5' UTR (referred as control 5' UTR) and is commonly employed for mammalian cell expression. Compared to cells transfected with the MBP control, MBP-Nsp1-transfected cells showed markedly reduced mScarlet expression.

The 40S structure was rigidly fit using the PDB entry 6g5h (Ameismeier et al., 2018) . The Nsp1-CT could be traced in the cryo-EM map, which revealed a tight helical hairpin (Figure 2A-C) . However, the MBP tag and the Nterminal domain (Nsp1-NT) are invisible in the cryo-EM map, suggesting that they are flexibly linked to the CT. Consistently, there is a predicted ~20 residue linker between Nsp1-NT and Nsp1-CT. Nsp1 interacts with the 40S at the mRNA channel located at the interface between the head and body of the 40S ( Figure 2B ). As such, Nsp1 binding blocks mRNA entry to the ribosome to inhibit protein translation, in agreement with recent structural studies (Schubert et al., 2020; Thoms et al., 2020) .",

It is worth noting that three out of the four binding interfaces are between Nsp1 and the body of the 40S (uS5, eS30, 18S); only one interface, at the most proximal region of the Nsp1-CT, is with the head of the 40S (uS3) ( Figure 2D ). The Nsp1-uS3 interface has a buried surface area of 283 \u00c5 2 with mostly charge-charge interactions, and is mediated by Nsp1 residues, including D152, E155, E159 and D156 ( Figure 2E ). In contrast, the Nsp1-uS5 interface has a larger buried surface area of 440 \u00c5 2 , with mainly hydrophobic interactions ( Figure 2E ). At the interface with the18S rRNA, Nsp1 residues H165 and K164 stack with the bases of U607, U630, and U631, while R171 and R175 form charge-charge interactions with the phosphate backbone of A604, G606 and U607 ( Figure 2E ). For the Nsp1-eS30 interaction, negatively charged residues E172 and E176 of Nsp1 interact with positively charged residues K52 and K53 at one extended loop of eS30 ( Figure 2E ).

Consistent with this hypothesis, we observed certain degrees of movement between the head and body of the 40S during 3D classification and reconstruction; as a result, high-resolution cryo-EM maps were obtained using focused refinement ( Figure S1 ). We postulate that the flexibility of the head, as well as its limited interaction with Nsp1-CT, may be important for the ability of SARS-CoV-2 5' UTR to dislodge the Nsp1-40S interaction to evade the translation block (see DISCUSSION).",

In contrast to the control 5' UTR, expression of the mScarlet reporter downstream from SARS-CoV-2 5' UTR in MBP-Nsp1 transfected cells was not significantly different from MBP transfected control cells. As expected, MBP-Nsp1-NT, which does not interact with the 40S, also did not affect mScarlet reporter expression. By contrast, a severe reduction in mScarlet expression was observed by MBP-Nsp1-CT (p < 0.001). Co-expression of MBP-Nsp1-NT did not remove the inhibitory effect of MBP-Nsp1-CT on mScarlet expression, suggesting that only covalently linked NT and CT could rescue mScarlet expression downstream the SARS-CoV-2 5' UTR.

In contrast to the intact SARS-CoV-2 5' UTR, which showed no change in reporter activity in the presence or absence of Nsp1, cells expressing the SARS-CoV-2 \u0394SL1 5' UTR reporter showed dramatically reduced mScarlet mean fluorescence intensity upon Nsp1 co-expression ( Figure 4E ). We also generated SARS-CoV-2 SL1 or \u0394SL1 5' UTR luciferase reporter and found that SL1 conferred partial antagonism to translation suppression by Nsp1, while \u0394SL1 lost the ability to escape the translation suppression ( Figure 4F ). Together, these data support the role of SL1 in SARS-CoV-2 5' UTR as an important element in the evasion of translation inhibition. Curiously, a previous study failed to show SARS-CoV-2 5' UTRmediated evasion of Nsp1-mediated translation inhibition (Schubert et al., 2020) . However, judging from the primer used, the 5' UTR in the experiment did not contain SL1, consistent with our data on SARS-CoV-2 \u0394SL1 5' UTR.",

Consistent with recently published cryo-EM structures (Schubert et al., 2020; Thoms et al., 2020) , our data showed that the helical hairpin at the CT of SARS-CoV-2 Nsp1 interacts with the 40S subunit of the ribosome to block mRNA entry ( Figure 5 ), confirming that Nsp1-CT is a general inhibitor of the cellular translation machinery. More importantly, we revealed that Nsp1-NT directly interacts with SARS-CoV-2 5' UTR, and that this interaction relieves translational inhibition imposed by Nsp1-CT to allow successful translation of the SARS-CoV-2 mRNA ( Figure 5 ). Thus, coronaviruses like SARS-CoV-2 have evolved a clever strategy to selectively hijack the host translation machinery to support their own replication while counteracting the host immune response.",

When SARS-CoV-2 5' UTR is bound to Nsp1-NT, the covalently linked Nsp1-CT cannot bind 40S likely due to a steric factor in which Nsp1-CT is unable to reach 40S for a productive interaction. This in turn allows loading of the SARS-CoV-2 mRNA for translation initiation. Consistent with this hypothesis, increasing the linker length between Nsp1-NT and Nsp1-CT greatly reduced SARS-CoV-2 5' UTR-mediated translation in the presence of Nsp1 ( Figure 5 ). Even when an Nsp1 molecule is already bound to a ribosome, we postulate that the SARS-CoV-2 5' UTR can interact with Nsp1-NT to strip off the Nsp1-CT-40S interaction to proceed with viral mRNA translation. One possible scenario is that the binding of SARS-CoV-2 5' UTR to Nsp1-NT exerts a pulling force via the short linker to the N-terminus of Nsp1-CT, which is weakly bound at the flexible head of the 40S, to dislodge Nsp1-CT from the 40S. This mechanism may be analogous to how newly synthesized I\u03baB\u03b1 can remove the NF-\u03baB transcription factor from the bound DNA (Oeckinghaus and Ghosh, 2009) .",

The forward primer of SARS-CoV-2 5\u2032 UTR is 5' ATTAAAGGTTTATACCTTCCCAG 3', and the reverse primer is 5' CTTACCTTTCGGTCACAC 3'. Cells were collected and lysed in RIPA lysis buffer (Thermo Scientific) with complete protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche Applied Science). The protein levels were determined using Western blot analysis. Equal portions of the cell lysate were run on a 15% SDS-PAGE gel and blotted onto a PVDF membrane, which was subsequently probed with HRP Anti-Strep tag antibody (Abcam) and developed with an ECL substrate (Amersham Biosciences).",

First, Nsp1 blocks host mRNA from binding to the 40S ribosomal subunit due to physical occlusion by the bound Nsp1-CT. Second, Nsp1 supports viral mRNA translation by interacting with SARS-CoV-2 5' UTR using Nsp1-NT, which results in dissociation of the Nsp1-CT-40S complex to overcome inhibition. This mechanism of evasion of Nsp1-mediated translation inhibition is illustrated by the failure of linker-lengthened Nsp1 to support viral mRNA translation. With the longer linker, the Nsp1-NT-5' UTR complex can co-exist with the Nsp1-CT-40S complex. ",
