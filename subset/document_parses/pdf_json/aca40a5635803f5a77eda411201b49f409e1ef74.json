            "text": "Recent studies have advocated using the total dissipation rate under topology optimization to realize material designs involving the flow of fluids through porous media. However, these studies decided how to pose the design problem, such as maximizing the total dissipation rate for some situations while minimizing for others, by solving one-dimensional problems and justifying their choices using numerical experiments. The rigor is lacking-a bottleneck for further scientific advancements to computational material design. This paper provides the missing theoretical justification. We identify four classes of boundary value problems using the adjoint state method and analytically calculate the sensitivity of the total dissipation rate to the permeability field. For two of those classes in which the flow of fluids is pressure-driven, the sensitivity is positive-the total dissipation rate increases if the medium's permeability increases. While for the other two classes, in which the flow is velocity-driven, the trend is the opposite. These sensitivities provide rigorous answers to the central question: how to pose a material design problem for flow through porous media applications. The impact of our work is multi-fold. First, this study further elevates the role of the dissipation rate in posing well-posed material design problems using topology optimization. Second, besides the theoretical significance, the results benefit computational scientists and practitioners to realize optimal designs. Third, given their simplicity yet far-reaching impact, both the approach and results possess immense pedagogical value.",

For instance, in water filtration using membranes, the surface of the pores is coated with (chemical) functional groups so that microbes, which have surface charges, are removed via electrostatic attraction or repulsion. The question in such applications is how to manipulate pore surfaces to extract pathogens optimally. In applications involving thermal regulation (e.g., heat exchangers), researchers alter the multi-phase characteristics of the fluids to maximize cooling efficiency. Yet, in some other applications, one designs the very geometrical nature of the pore structure. In this paper, the material design optimizes the dissipation rate via the spatial distribution of porous materials with different permeabilities.",

Although the early studies focused on structural optimization, topology optimization is increasingly popular in several other fields involving the flow of fluids through porous media; these emerging fields include the design of microfluidic devices [Alexandersen and Andreasen, 2020; Kreissl et al., 2011] and medical devices such as dialyzer (filter) used for hemodialysis [Alonso and Silva, 2021; Cancilla et al., 2022] . However, many works apply topology optimization in these relatively new application areas by mimicking the material design problem from solid mechanics. For example, some of these works replace the compliance with a similar-looking quadratic functional or replace the principle of minimum potential energy from structural mechanics with the principle of minimum power [Guest and Pr\u00e9vost, 2006; Phatak and Nakshatrala, 2021b] . However, such a translation from solid mechanics to flow through porous media may not be physically meaningful and sometimes not even consistent with the state equations. For example, the minimum power principle does not apply to nonlinear porous models but is limited to linear models such as Darcy and Darcy-Brinkman. More importantly, the said principle is not a physical law but rather a restatement of the governing equations for linear models using the calculus of variations [Phatak and Nakshatrala, 2021b] .",

Since then, researchers have applied this method in the design of structural systems [Haug et al., 1986] , seismology [Tromp et al., 2005] , topology optimization [Jensen et al., 2014; Nakshatrala and Tortorelli, 2016; Nakshatrala et al., 2013] , reliability studies and parameter identification [Tortorelli and Michaleris, 1994] , check-pointing in computer codes [Wang et al., 2009] , machine learning [Zhuang et al., 2020] , PDE-constrained optimization [Bradley, 2013; Hinze et al., 2008] , and inverse problems in subsurface modeling [Sun, 2013] . The main advantage of the adjoint state method is in the calculation of the sensitivity of an objective function to a set of design parameters. The method circumvents the explicit calculation of the sensitivity of the solution fields by introducing Lagrange multipliers, calculated by solving an adjoint problem (also referred to as the adjoint state problem), which itself is a system of partial differential equations.",

Two of them are pressure-driven, and the other two are velocity-driven; the adjoint problem is analytically solvable for these classes of problems. As shown in this paper, the answers to the questions raised above-how the total dissipation rate alters with the permeability field and how to pose material design problems-depend on the class of problems. Notably, for the two pressure-driven classes of problems, the total dissipation rate increases with an increase in the permeability field; in comparison, the reverse trend holds for the two velocity-driven classes of problems. Thus, for example, trivial designs occur under different scenarios for pressure-driven and velocity-driven problems. These findings have theoretical, numerical, practical, and pedagogical significance. The research will place the total dissipation rate for material design problems on a sound theoretical footing, achieved by rigorously answering the aforementioned design-related questions.",

However, in a material design problem, say topology optimization, the permeability field is the design variable-an unknown by itself. During design iterations, the permeability field changes, altering the solution fields in each iteration. Regarding this paper, we address changes to the total dissipation rate upon changes to the permeability field. To quantify such changes (i.e., to calculate sensitivities), one must account for the implicit dependence of the dissipation rate on the permeability field via the solution fields.

The solution to above forward problem is again denoted by v DB (x; k(x)) and p DB (x; k(x)).Using the adjoint method, the sensitivity of the total dissipation rate to the permeability field can be written as follows:By following a similar procedure as before, we get the following adjoint problem corresponding to the alternative form of Darcy-Brinkman equations:Even under this alternative form, the expression for the sensitivity of the total dissipation rate with respect to the permeability field is same as before:where \u039b(x) satisfies the adjoint problem (A3a)-(A3d).
