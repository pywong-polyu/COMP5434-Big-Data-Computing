            "text": "Objective: To examine changes in outpatient visits for mental health and/or substance use disorders (MH/SUD) in an integrated healthcare organization during the initial Massachusetts COVID-19 surge and partial state reopening. Methods: Observational study of outpatient MH/SUD visits January 1st-June 30th, 2018-2020 by: 1) visit diagnosis group, 2) provider type, 3) patient race/ethnicity, 4) insurance, and 5) visit method (telemedicine vs. inperson). Results: Each year, January-June 52,907-73,184 patients were seen for a MH/SUD visit. While non-MH/SUD visits declined during the surge relative to 2020 pre-pandemic (\u221238.2%), MH/SUD visits increased (9.1%)-concentrated in primary care (35.3%) and non-Hispanic Whites (10.5%). During the surge, MH visit volume increased 11.7% while SUD decreased 12.7%. During partial reopening, while MH visits returned to 2020 pre-pandemic levels, SUD visits declined 31.1%; MH/SUD visits decreased by Hispanics (\u221233.0%) and non-Hispanic Blacks (\u221224.6%), and among Medicaid (\u221219.4%) and Medicare enrollees (\u221220.9%). Telemedicine accounted for ~5% of MH/SUD visits pre-pandemic and 83.3%-83.5% since the surge. Conclusions: MH/SUD visit volume increased during the COVID surge and was supported by rapidly-scaled telemedicine. Despite this, widening diagnostic and racial/ethnic disparities in MH/SUD visit volume during the surge and reopening suggest additional barriers for these vulnerable populations, and warrant continued monitoring and research.",

Within weeks, a series of additional community stressors followed: state and federal declarations of emergency, closures of non-essential businesses, schools and child-care facilities, and a burgeoning unemployment rate [30] . The purpose of this research is to examine changes in outpatient visits for MH/SUD in a large Boston-area healthcare system before the initial COVID-19 pandemic medical surge, during the surge and community state of emergency, and initial state partial reopening periods, and to examine disparities by diagnosis and patient race/ethnicity. We examine outpatient visits for MH/SUD care across all providers in the health care system (i.e., specialty behavioral health, primary care, or non-behavioral health specialty care). Also, we examine the extent to which telemedicine was able to replace in-person MH/SUD care.",

In early March, the healthcare system was in the early stages of implementing EHR-integrated video visits using a vendor product. Recognizing that rapid, wide-scale adoption of EHR-integrated telemedicine visits was not feasible as part of imminent-pandemic planning, the organization instead provisioned stand-alone telemedicine accounts as an initial implementation strategy. Additionally, the initial vendor product that was planned for wide-scale EHR-integration could not accommodate group psychotherapy (i.e., connections with one or more providers and multiple patients/participants), an important treatment in MH/SUD care. Therefore, for group therapy sessions, the organization decided also to implement a second vendor product that was being used by the organization for non-clinical business purposes but for which the organization had in place a Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) complaint Business Associates Agreement (BAA). This second product could accommodate multiple participants in a meeting for group therapy. Therefore, at the outset of the pandemic there were two different telemedicine vendor products being implemented in the organization: one product for \"1:1\" (i.e., 1 provider and 1 patient) sessions, and another for group therapy sessions. Within the first week of wide-spread use of the 1:1 vendor product, providers across the organization (MH/SUD and non-MH/SUD providers) were experiencing frequent connectivity and technical difficulties that were disrupting outpatient patient care. Due to the difficulty in using the original 1:1 telemedicine vendor product, on March 25th the healthcare organization decided to discontinue its use and instead use only the second, stand-alone, product for all healthcare visits (i.e., 1:1 connections and group sessions), with a plan for eventual and phased integration of this second product into the EHR. Additionally, during the pandemic providers were encouraged to use either telephone or video visits to maintain patient care, if clinically appropriate.",

During the surge and state's partial reopening, SUD visits decreased below pre-COVID-19 levels. MH visits, while not statistically lower, appear to be on a downward trend as well; primary care MH/SUD visits decreased to pre-pandemic levels. These changes in MH/SUD visits were in the context of a dramatic decrease in non-MH/SUD visits (during the pandemic surge) and still low but recovering volume of non-MH/SUD visits (during the partial reopening). It is perhaps not surprising that primary care would be the initial setting for increased MH treatment-seeking during the surge. Specialty behavioral health providers are in short supply [31] , and in a recently published national qualitative study, early in the pandemic surge at least one type of MH/SUD specialist-psychiatrists-described being able to continue care of existing patients but that was more difficult to see new patients due to challenges in learning and navigating the rapid transition to virtual care [14] . Also, patients commonly receive MH care in primary care [32] . Under these circumstances, contacting one's primary care provider is an understandable response to initial increased psychiatric distress. Primary care providers can assess a patient's MH/SUD clinical needs, and either treat and/or assist in triage and referral to specialty care if needed. Different communities are undergoing COVID-19 surges at different time points in the U.S.; knowing that initial increases in demand for mental health services may be concentrated in primary care provides important information for healthcare systems looking to prepare for these needs. For example, integrating primary care with behavioral healthcare [33, 34] could help organizations to better address the needs of these patients. However, transitioning quickly to supporting primary care with integrated behavioral health care may not be easy for organizations. Some services in integrated care are not routinely reimbursed by insurance, which could pose as a barrier in some organizations, absent alternative payment model contracting (such as accountable care organizations (ACOs)) that could encourage care that is not solely tied to fee-for-service care in the organization [35] .",

While possible that patients sought care outside of the health system, it seems unlikely that community providers would have the capacity to absorb a greater proportion of MH/SUD care during the surge or partial opening, relative to pre-COVID. The large relative decrease in SUD visits in both periods is particularly concerning given reports of increases substance use and opioid overdose during the pandemic [8, 9] . Further, the pandemic has disrupted self-help groups such as Alcoholics Anonymous and Narcotics Anonymous [36] , important recovery supports for individuals with SUD. These reductions in visit requires further evaluation and monitoring.",

There is recent evidence that the rise in unemployment has left more individuals and households without health insurance [41, 42] . We explored whether visits associated with commercial insurance decreased, but this was not the case. However, visits associated with Medicaid and Medicare plans decreased during reopening phase. It is unlikely the decrease in Medicaid visits during the partial reopening reflects disruptions in Medicaid eligibility in the population; Massachusetts suspended Medicaid terminations and initiated a premium waiver for hardship during the pandemic emergency [43] . More likely is that the decrease in visits from individuals who are enrolled in Medicaid and Medicare reflects the additional challenges faced by individuals who are poor, disabled and/or elderly in terms of the \"digital divide\" in access to digital technology, broadband, and/or ability or proficiency in using these tools [44] [45] [46] . While more research is needed, this finding suggests that other factors, likely related to social determinants of health, may be influencing access to MH/SUD care. Telemedicine, particularly video visits, scaled quickly for MH/SUD care-and more so than for non-MH/SUD visits. Our results are consistent with recent research describing that as telemedicine visits increased during the pandemic, MH/SUD visits experienced the least decline among medical specialties [13] . The rapid diffusion of telemedicine occurred in the context of more permissive policy, licensure and reimbursement changes by federal and state governments, and health plans. Its future use will depend upon to what extent these policies revert back to the pre-pandemic state. Our study finds that telemedicine enabled a rapid, system-wide ability to maintain and early on increase access to MH care. Still, our findings of decreased MH/ SUD visit volume and racial/ethnic disparities during the surge and reopening suggest additional access to care challenges that future research needs to address. While telemedicine can preserve access to MH/SUD care for some patients, these results suggest that it is unlikely to overcome other barriers related to structural inequalities/disparities and social determinants of health.",

            "text": "There are several limitations to note in this study. First, not all patients with MH/SUD diagnoses associated with visits may meet diagnostic criteria for these disorders. Also, MH/SUD visits are undercounted for patients with visits outside of the organization. We defined visits for MH/SUD as being limited to those with a primary diagnosis that is a MH/SUD condition because we were interested in understanding what was happening with visits for MH or SUD. While some MH/SUD treatment may occur in outpatient visits for which a MH/SUD is not the primary diagnosis/reason for the visit, absent review of the clinical content of notes, the focus or active management of MH/SUD in a given visit is less clear when it is not the primary diagnosis. Additionally, while visit counts may not reflect the total MH/SUD care received by these patients, they do reflect important changes in MH/ SUD care that are occurring in the healthcare system. Another limitation to consider is that our findings of rapid and sustained implementation of telehealth for outpatient MH/SUD care in this healthcare organization may not generalize to other healthcare organizations or U.S. regions. For example, recent analysis of Medicare data from April 2020 finds that urban areas saw greater growth in telemedicine primary care visits compared to rural areas (likely due to urban areas having greater broadband access), and that even among urban areas, there was wide variation in telemedicine use-with Boston having the highest proportion of Medicare fee-for-service primary care telemedicine visits compared to other urban areas [10] . Important strengths of this study are that the healthcare organization is large, includes a diverse array of settings, and has an integrated EHR system. Other strengths are that our data include visits from patients of diverse insurance types (e.g., commercial, Medicare, and Medicaid), and our use of several years of data available as comparisons to pre-COVID healthcare use.",

            "text": "MH/SUD visits increased during the COVID surge, largely in primary care. Telemedicine can be rapidly scaled across a healthcare system to address what would otherwise be drastic decreases in patient access to MH/SUD care, particularly during the pandemic surge. However, as the pandemic and its associated economic crisis continue to unfold, subsequent decreases in MH/SUD visits suggest additional barriers to care. In particular, we found concerning disparities of care for patients with SUD, those who are racial and ethnic minorities, and patients from vulnerable, underserved populations. These findings highlight the importance of future research aimed at better understanding barriers to MH/SUD care during the pandemic, particularly for populations that appear to be especially vulnerable to disruptions in care such as individuals with SUD, as well as those who are racial/ ethnic minorities or for whom structural health equity and/or digital divide challenges may be affecting access to care.
