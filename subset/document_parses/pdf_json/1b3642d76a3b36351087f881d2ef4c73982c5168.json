This study aims to develop the application of a quality function deployment approach to increase the resilience of the food supply chain by understanding customer needs and logistical risks in the food supply chain. In-depth studies with empirical analysis were conducted to determine the importance of customer needs, food supply chain risks, and actions to improve supply chain resilience of SMEs in the agri-food industry. The result shows that the top three customer needs are \"attractive, bright color\", \"firm texture\" and \"fresh smell\". The top three risks in the agri-food supply chain are \"improper storage,\" \"Harvest Failure\" and \"Human Resource Risks\" and the top three resilience actions are \"continuous training,\" \"preventive maintenance,\" and \"supply chain forecasting.\" The implications of this study are to propose an idea that broadens the perspective of supply chain resilience in the agri-food industry by incorporating the needs of customers in considering how to mitigate the existing risks to the satisfaction of customers, and it also highlights the relatively low skill and coordination of the workforce in agri-food supply chains.",

            "text": "Instead of using a closed strategy to compete in the industry, companies are forced to form a system to work together in today's global economic era [1] . Since food supply chain is an important human need and many organizations are involved in the value creation process, it is exposed to various risks caused by nature or human actions. Intense competition in the market in satisfying customer needs increases the demand of suppliers, which leads to increasing dependency among organizations [2] . This phenomenon makes the food supply chain vulnerable and poses the potential risk of disruption spreading throughout the supply chain [3] . Supply chain disruption can affect the company's cost efficiency, customer satisfaction, and the company's ability to generate profits [4] . To survive in the industry, companies must have a resilient supply chain. Supply chain resilience is the ability of a supply chain system to sustain the system by returning to its original state or adopting a new, more desirable state after a disruption and avoid system failure [5] . Supply chain resilience gives the firm the ability to proactively respond to changing market conditions and disruptions that may occur outside of competition. The literature used in this study focuses on operational aspects such as quality and risk in food logistics and supply chains. In addition, the academic literature related to this study provides several specific studies that can suggest a structural framework for implementing supply chain resilience.",

Agri-Food SMEs were selected as the research subject because of the importance of the supply chain and its logistical processes for a sustainable food system and its impact on food security and economic stability in general. QFD was first introduced in Japan by Akao [6] as a method for generating customer satisfaction and quality assurance points using information about customer needs. QFD is seen as a method to translate customer needs as business requirements into the company's production processes to ensure that companies understand customer expectations of the product and service development process [7] .",

Companies need to accurately identify customer needs to obtain information that can be used to design supply chains that meet customer needs in order to gain competitive advantage and increase customer satisfaction. Several studies have examined quality attributes in the context of agri-food industry [17] [18] [19] . Attributes related to product quality, such as freshness, safety, and hygiene, have always been the most important factor in agri-food product selection, followed by attributes related to price. This is because the agri-food industry has different product attributes than other industries where fresh, perishable products dominate. The product value decreases when the freshness of the product decreases due to the spoilage process [20] .",

The literature on risk management in agri-food supply chain is significant, but still very limited. Dai and Liu [27] identify several risks in the agri-food business, namely the risk in the production chain, such as the impact of natural disasters leading to losses in the production process, the risk in the distribution chain, such as risks arising from transportation and unexpected loss of goods during transportation. Retail chain-based risk, which is caused by incomplete information about the product leading to the disappointment of the end consumer, and consumption chain-based risk, namely the risk arising from the estimates of customer behavior, buying habits, and customer demand based on historical data, which may be the risk of inaccurate business forecasts. In addition, Yazdani et al. [13] conducted a comprehensive analysis of agricultural supply chain risk management decision making framework which successfully identified agricultural supply chain risks including natural disasters and weather changes, biological and environmental risks, logistical and infrastructure risks, management and operational risks, public policy and institutional risks, and political and security risks, while Jianying et al. [28] stated that economic risks, such as problems related to production and logistics costs, social risks related to public policies, laws, and regulatory changes, and cooperation risks, such as lack of organizational capabilities of enterprises in terms of coordination and control caused by a weak sense of cooperation, are the most significant risks among all existing risk factors of the agricultural supply chain.",

[29] emphasized the importance of detailed product information related to production, processing, and preparation to reduce the risks associated with contamination of agricultural products by diseases, to increase the resilience of food systems to protect food security and learn how perishable agricultural products are handled before they reach the consumer. The researchers also pointed out the common problem of unclear information flow in the food supply chain and low awareness of the importance of understanding supply chain risks [30] . Regulations such as mobility restrictions during the pandemic COVID-19 further increase risks in the agricultural and food supply chains. Logistical risks are associated with delivery delays due to mobility restrictions. Socio-economic risks such as the risk of child labor due to lower household income of workers producing agricultural products due to production disruptions. then environmental risks associated with the impact of agricultural product waste due to logistical delays and risks to global food security [31] .",

            "text": "Research related to supply chain resilience is generally concerned with the ability of supply chains to overcome the impact of unavoidable risks and return to their original operating conditions or transition to new, better conditions after a disruption [32] . Specifically, companies can take actions to improve the resilience of their supply chain by meeting unexpected customer demands. In this way, they can gain a competitive advantage by creating plans to respond to and recover quickly from supply chain disruptions [33] . From the literature of several researchers, supply chain resilience has been successfully evaluated in the context of agrifood industry using different approaches. One of them is Coopmans et al. [34] , who uses mixed methods to describe supply chain resilience as a measurable assessment of a company's ability to make decisions by considering quantitative and qualitative indicators that are efficiently used to recover quickly from losses. Soni et al. [35] then present the implementation of supply chain resilience measurement using a deterministic modelling approach that is able to measure resilience with a single numerical index as a form of supply chain resilience quantification that will help companies evaluate the effectiveness of various risk mitigation strategies to facilitate supply chain resilience decision making. In addition, the qualitative discussion by Hecht et al. [36] identifies factors related to supply chain resilience in food companies including formal contingency plans, employee training, food suppliers, locations, service providers, post-event learning and infrastructure, redundant food supply, staff presence, and insurance. how these factors can provide a response in terms of risk mitigation and how these factors relate to the company's ability to withstand disruptions to ensure reliable access to food availability and safety.",

            "text": "Researchers have presented various ways to improve supply chain resilience. For example, Rajesh [37] stated that supply chain resilience can be improved by increasing supply chain flexibility, but to build a flexible supply chain, the complexity within a supply chain must be reduced as much as possible. Companies need to carefully develop a flexible business strategy that considers reducing elements that have less impact on supply chain resilience. A flexible supply chain has the ability to be both proactive and reactive to anticipate internal and external disruptions and uncertainties required to achieve excellent performance outcomes [38] . Li et al. [39] propose a specific example of supply chain flexibility by implementing a volume flexibility contract which can encourage producers to build capacity as the retailer's reserves and maintain channel coordination. It also helps retailers to reduce the mismatch between supply and demand as a risk sharing mechanism with lower reservation costs and more flexibility, which can encourage companies to expand and improve performance to achieve more overall profit for the supply chain as a whole. Spieske and Birkel [40] show that the visibility and collaboration aspects of supply chain planning can have an impact on increasing the sustainable resilience of the supply chain. Visibility is considered an important factor as it helps companies to obtain information about the origin of materials and components, which increases the company's understanding of its supply chain partners, which can help companies to mitigate the risk of problems at the supplier's location [41] . Collaboration in terms of interactions in the process of information dissemination, decision making, constructive communication and goal alignment has a positive effect on increasing supply chain resilience. However, collaboration can also increase interdependence among supply chain actors, which increases the risk of creating ripple effects throughout the supply chain [42] .",

The advantage of the model proposed in this study is to create a supply chain resilience design based on customer needs. Essentially, we propose an approach with two HoQ matrices. The first one links CNs to agri-food supply risk (AFSCRs) in terms of the risk performance on CNs. Then link AFSCRs to supply chain resilience actions (SCRAs) to determine how SMEs can mitigate emerging risks. The two HoQ matrix structures can be seen in Fig 1. The process used to create the HoQ matrix is described below. Preliminary consultations with industry representatives and a literature review were conducted to identify CNs and resilience designs. Resilience design in this study is an analysis of resilience measures that produce solutions in the form of priorities for action. We validated the CNs, AFSCRs, and SCRAs by conducting in-depth interviews with industry stakeholders and questionnaire surveys of end-users. Based on the data obtained from the interviews and surveys, we then developed a HoQ matrix based on the degree of importance and relationship between CNs, AFSCRs, and SCRAs. As explained earlier, there are two HoQ matrices used in the QFD approach in this study. The first matrix links CNs to agri-food supply chain risks (AFSCRs) to define AFSCRs in terms of their impact on SME business continuity based on the defined CNs attributes. CNs are represented as attributes that relate to what customers want. Therefore, SMEs need to properly identify and determine the importance of CNs, while AFSCRs are represented as factors that directly affect CNs attributes related to disruptions in achieving customer satisfaction. The initial HoQ matrix was created based on the adaptation of the QFD model by Wicaksono et al. [20] with the main steps described in detail in Section 4.1.",

In this study, semi-structured in-depth interviews were conducted with ten loyal customers of SME retailers to identify CNs. Similar in-depth interviews were also conducted with twenty of the largest and most influential actors in the agri-food industry, including SME owners, suppliers, and logistics actors, to identify risks in the agri-food supply chain, assess the relationship between CNs and AFSCRs and between AFSCRs and SCRAs, and assess the priority of agri-food supply chain resilience actions (SCRAs). Conducting interviews with economic actors and industry stakeholders is a common method for data collection in studies related to QFD [50, 51] . This study also uses a Likert scale (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) questionnaire to survey 341 customers of small and medium enterprises in the agri-food industry to create a summative score to measure a construct. The customer profile can be found in Table 1 .

To reduce the risk of harvest failure, it is also necessary to implement a cropping plan adapted to the local climate based on the planting calendar, use better pest-resistant varieties, vaccinate livestock, and regularly monitor livestock health and environmental conditions. Training in quality management correlates least with the harvest failure attribute, as the phenomenon of force majeure is very difficult to predict even with advanced training. Bullwhip effect. Accurate supply chain forecasting is an effective way to prevent the negative effects of the bullwhip effect. Such forecasting capabilities require adequate knowledge of supply chain resilience, which can be improved through continuous training. We support the findings of Mithun Ali et al.

The results show that the skills and knowledge of the agri-food SMEs actors in the studied supply chain are relatively low. This also affects the weak coordination among organizations in the supply chain. Efforts to improve supply chain resilience need to be carried out with systematic coordinated actions between organizations in the supply chain. Companies need to understand the importance of maximizing the benefits of the entire supply chain and not just focusing on their own profit motive. Retailers can undertake coordination and collaboration initiatives that are flexible and with guaranteed mutual benefits in terms of increased profits by minimizing costs and risks.

First, this study is able to provide new ideas and successfully fill the literature gap presented in Section 2 by considering attributes of customer needs and combining them with risk attributes to find resilience solutions that can also satisfy customers in the agri-food supply chain of SMEs. Secondly, this study is able to provide ideas for future researchers as a reference for the practical procedural steps in using two levels of HoQ as a tool to determine the what and how in the QFD method. The thorough understanding gained from a recent literature review on agri-food quality, agri-food risk and supply chain resilience provides the basis for identifying and developing attributes for customer needs, agri-food risk and resilience to build HoQ, which is also confirmed by customers and relevant industry stakeholders. Third, this study proposes an idea for a list of customer needs, risks and resilience solutions that could become a standard for future research. This study also has practical implications for agri-food SMEs to build a resilient agri-food supply chain. Firstly, this study has succeeded in highlighting the low skills and knowledge of agri-food actors, especially in the area of supply chain and total quality, so as to raise enthusiasm for improving skills. In addition, agri-food SMEs are weak in coordination among organizations in the supply chain as they are only concerned about internal operational benefits. In view of the findings of this study, it is recommended that agri-food SMEs, starting from producers to suppliers to distributors and retailers, can improve coordination and collaboration to overcome customer satisfaction risks.",
