This requires age-appropriate tools that allow students to develop a comprehensive understanding of Machine Learning in order to become creators of smart solutions. Following the trend of visual languages for introducing algorithms and programming in K-12, we present a ten-year systematic mapping of emerging visual tools that support the teaching of Machine Learning at this educational stage and analyze the tools concerning their educational characteristics, support for the development of ML models as well as their deployment and how the tools have been developed and evaluated. As a result, we encountered 16 tools targeting students mostly as part of short duration extracurricular activities. Tools mainly support the interactive development of ML models for image recognition tasks using supervised learning covering basic steps of the ML process. Being integrated into popular block-based programming languages (primarily Scratch and App Inventor), they also support the deployment of the created ML models as part of games or mobile applications. Findings indicate that the tools can effectively leverage students' understanding of Machine Learning, however, further studies regarding the design of the tools concerning educational aspects are required to better guide their effective adoption in schools and their enhancement to support the learning process more comprehensively.",

            "text": "Yet, teaching fundamental AI (including ML) concepts and techniques has traditionally been done only in higher education (Torrey, 2012) . And, although computing education is increasingly being included in K-12 worldwide, these programs rarely cover AI content at this educational stage (Hubwieser, 2015) , although studies have shown that children are able to learn ML concepts from a relatively young age (Hitron et al., 2019) . The exposure to this kind of complex knowledge has even the potential to enhance children's everyday skills, better equipping them to deal with the social, economic, and ethical issues that are arising from the use of ML (Kahn et al., 2020) . Furthermore, AI literacy may encourage more students to consider careers in this area and provide solid preparation for higher education and their future profession., According to AI4K12 (Touretzky et al., 2019a) , AI education should cover five big ideas in K-12, including Machine Learning that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed (Touretzky et al., 2019a; Wollowski et al., 2016) . This includes an understanding of basic ML concepts, such as learning algorithms and fundamentals of neural networks as well as the limitations and ethical concerns related to ML. And, for students to become not just consumers of AI, but creators of intelligent solutions, this also requires teaching the application of these concepts, e.g., by developing image recognition models, since students who experience in a hands-on manner the possibilities, strengths, and weaknesses of ML are more likely to obtain a deeper understanding Kandlhofer et al., 2016; Touretzky et al., 2019b) . Therefore, primarily active learning that emphasizes doing and direct experience by the student is important, as it helps to make ML transparent, enabling students to build correct mental models, and encouraging them to develop their own ML applications aiming at an engaging education (Wong et al., 2020) .",

Therefore, to popularize ML, it is desirable to reduce the cognitive effort so the user can focus on the logic to solve the problem at hand (Knuth & Pardo, 1980) . For this purpose, visual languages have been introduced that let users create programs by simply drag-and-drop a visual element on a canvas and subsequently connecting that element with other elements rather than by specifying them textually (Idrees et al., 2018; Weintrop & Wilensky, 2017) . Such visual representations can take diverse forms, including block-based or flow-based languages (Burnett & Baker, 1994; Pasternak et al., 2017) . Visual languages can improve learnability for novices by helping them to prevent errors, favor recognition over recall, and provide domain-specific limited instruction sets reducing the cognitive load (\u00c7akiro\u011flu et al. 2018 ). These advantages have led to widespread adoption within introductory programming contexts across different educational stages (Bau et al., 2017) . Especially in K-12, block-based programming languages such as Scratch, SNAP!, Blockly, and App Inventor are widely used for teaching algorithms and programming concepts (Weintrop, 2019) .",

Reviews on teaching ML in K-12, such as Marques et al.

On the other hand, reviews on ML tools in general, such as by Dudley and Kristensson (2018) analyze only the user interface design of interactive ML tools. Therefore, we present in this article the results of a systematic mapping study on visual tools for teaching ML in K-12 of the last decade (2010) (2011) (2012) (2013) (2014) (2015) (2016) (2017) (2018) (2019) (2020) .

In this context, the AI for K-12 Working Group (AI4K12) aims at developing guidelines for teaching K-12 students about Artificial Intelligence. To frame these guidelines, \"big ideas\" in AI that every student should know are defined, including perception, representation & reasoning, learning, natural interaction, and societal impact (Touretzky et al., 2019a) . Thus, while AI is \"the science and engineering of making intelligent machines that have the ability to achieve goals as humans do\", Machine Learning (ML) is a subfield of AI dealing with the field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed (Mitchell, 1997) . ML algorithms build a mathematical model based on sample data, denoted as \"training data\", to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to perform the task. ML can be applied for a wide range of application domains and tasks, including image recognition, object detection, and segmentation, motion and pose recognition, as well as text, sound and speech recognition, sentiment analysis, among others (Blott et al., 2019) .",

            "text": "Yet, as machine learning is a complex knowledge area, students may have difficulties with the first steps when learning ML (Sulmont et al., 2019) . And, as K-12 students often do not have any prior computing experiences, it is important to carefully define the sequence of learning goals to be achieved. Thus, an effective way to learn ML should begin with lower-level competencies first, then progressing upwards. On the other hand, it is also important to not remain on lower levels, as this may hinder the development of creative competencies requiring open-ended and ill-defined learning activities. Therefore, the \"Use-Modify-Create\" cycle (Lee & Chen, 2015; Lytle, 2019) commonly used for the progression of learning computing concepts and practices, can also be adopted for ML education. Following this cycle, students ease into ML topics Requirements analysis During this stage, the main objective of the model and its target features are specified. This also includes the characterization of the inputs and expected outputs, specifying the problem. This may also involve design thinking approaches to define the objectives with existing needs and problems Data management During data collection, available datasets are identified and/or data is collected. This may include the selection of available datasets (e.g., ImageNet), as well as specialized ones for transfer learning. The data is prepared by validating, cleaning, and preprocessing the data. Data sets may be labeled for supervised learning. The data set is typically split into a training set to train the model, a validation set to select the best candidate from all models, and a test set to perform an unbiased performance evaluation of the chosen model on unseen data Feature engineering Using domain knowledge of the data, features are created including feature transformation, feature generation, selecting features from large pools of features among others",

The evaluation of ML models is not trivial, and many methods can be applied for model evaluation with various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1, mean absolute error, among others, which appropriateness depends on the specific task Model deployment and monitoring During the production/deployment phase, the model is deployed into a production environment to create a usable system and apply it to new incoming events in real-time by first \"using\" and analyzing a given ML artifact, then \"remixing/modifying\" an existing one, until eventually \"creating\" new ones. This progression incorporates a smooth transition from reusing a predefined artifact to learner-generated creative construction. This is important to go beyond coding or using ML applications following predefined tutorials, as these will not provide enough opportunity for a deeper understanding and creativity (Bellettini, 2014) . Furthermore, adopting a \"computational action\" strategy (Tissenbaum et al., 2019) , which allows students to learn ML concepts while creating meaningful artifacts that have a direct impact on their lives and their communities, is crucial to give learners the opportunity to be creative and express themselves through the application of ML (Kahn et al., 2020) . In order to support such learning by creating ML models, age-appropriated tools are required that should have a low floor and high ceiling to make it easy for novices to get started and possible to work on increasingly sophisticated projects (Resnick & Silverman, 2005) . In addition, they should support and suggest a wide range of different ML models, e. g, ranging from the recognition of pet images to music understanding to allow students to work on projects motivated by their interests and passions (Resnick & Silverman, 2005) .",

Therefore, we analyze the following questions: AQ1. What visual tools for teaching ML exist? AQ2. What are their educational characteristics? AQ3. What are their characteristics concerning the ML platform? AQ4. What are their characteristics concerning the deployment platform? AQ5. How have the tools been developed and evaluated? Inclusion and exclusion criteria. We consider only English-language publications that present a visual tool for the development of ML models, not including generic visual programming languages or tools for other domains. Due to the emergent nature of the topic of the review and the rapid evolution of ML recently, we focus on tools from the last decade (2010-2020). We focus on tools that allow to create custom ML models, excluding tools for demonstration purposes. We also exclude any approach focusing only on the visualization of ML models or aiming at the complete automation of their development. Furthermore, we only include tools that have been developed or used for educational purposes in K-12. Consequently, we exclude any ML tool targeted exclusively for professional or adult end-users. We consider only articles that present substantial information allowing the extraction of relevant information regarding the analysis questions. Therefore, abstract-only or one-page articles are excluded.",

Six tools, such as DeepScratch, eCraft2Learn, ScratchNodesML, and SnAIp provide block-based support by extending the respective programming environment providing specific ML blocks for data preparation, training, and evaluation. Yet, the majority (8 tools), including Google Teachable machine, PIC, and LearningML, adopt a workflow-based approach supporting the development of the ML by guiding the user step-by-step via a web browser or app-based visual user interface. We also encountered reports of the usage of two data flow-based tools (Orange and RapidMiner) for teaching ML in K-12. Adopting a dataflow-based approach, they use boxes as entities, connected by arrows, lines, or arcs which represent directed relations and the data flow. Such data flow-based tools provide much more detailed and complex functionality, enabling the user to even build the neural network architecture. This approach is typically adopted in visual ML tools for professional use. All tools are limited concerning the ML task they support, focusing mainly on recognition, such as image or speech recognition, being the tasks in which current ML applications are being very successful ( Fig. 5 and Table 9 ). Only eCraft2learn recently also added blocks supporting object detection and segmentation, while Zhu (2019) supports object detection. Other tasks covered, include speech synthesis by eCraft2Learn, clustering by Milo, and a game agent by SnAIp. The tools largely support all basic steps of a human-centric ML development process ( Fig. 6 and Table 9 ): first, they encourage the collection of small amounts of data and its labeling by organizing it into categories created by the user. Then, this data is used to train an ML model using transfer learning, which allows to build accurate models in a time-saving way, using diverse ML backends such as IBM Watson, Keras, Tensorflow. Once the model is trained, its performance can be evaluated. This is done mostly by allowing the user to test the model with new data for which the model gives as output the predicted label. Fewer tools visualize also performance metrics, such as accuracy and loss function (Carney et al., 2020) , or provide support to analyze the performance per image (Godec et al., 2019; Tang et al., 2019) . Most tools support also the export of the created model for its deployment either directly to a block-based programming environment or in diverse formats (such as Tensorflow.js, Python, etc.). Yet, none of the tools supports requirements analysis. Feature engineering is also covered only by Orange and RapidMiner, as they support more comprehensively a variety of ML techniques, including decision trees, etc.",

Yet, although some tools provide brief information on the vocabulary and/or these parameters, no further help tailored to the target audience is provided to guide the selection of their values. As uncertainty is an inevitable characteristic of ML models in most real-world applications, and, thus, when interacting with an ML model, it is important that users are aware of this uncertainty to manage their expectations on the model's performance (Dudley & Kristensson, 2018 ). Yet, the concept of a probabilistic model and its limitations can be difficult to convey to the students, who may have difficulties comprehending the implications as studies show that even a single outlier in a classifier can result in significant confusion for users (Kim et al., 2015) . In this respect, most tools also provide support for the evaluation of the trained ML model (Table 11) , mostly by allowing the user to test the model with new data (captured via webcam, etc.) for which the model gives as output the predicted label to which the input belongs, and the confidence value representing the hit probability.",

Another approach is the visualization of a correctness table and/or confidence graph (Fig. 9) . A correctness table shows all of the testing images and whether or not they were classified correctly. This helps users to infer why specific images were classified correctly or not by comparing the images to find similarities. A confidence graph shows all testing images for one label at a time based on model confidence. It allows users to infer the characteristics of images that a model learns for specific labels so that users can find patterns in how the model makes decisions to improve its accuracy. LearningML intends to show in advanced mode also a confusion matrix, a table that in each row presents the examples in a predicted class while each column represents the examples in an actual class. These visualizations of the results of the classification, facilitate the identification of data that are not accurately classified, and thus, support the analysis of the students to improve the model's performance. The use of examples to support the understanding of classes appears to be a promising solution that resonates with users (Kim et al., 2015) .

Taking into account the current situation, in which most students in K-12 do not have any previous knowledge on Artificial Intelligence or Machine Learning, most of these tools are appropriately designed for novices. Thus, following the design principles proposed by Resnick Middle school students Based on the results, ML can be used as a powerful tool to successfully conduct interdisciplinary education at the middle school level. Students combined knowledge, observations, and teamwork efforts to achieve the goal of using the ML model for prediction. Students had more fun, engagement, and hands-on interactivity in the workshop compared to their regular classroom, even though the topic of AI is much more complex and challenging 2005), these tools provide a low threshold, high ceiling, and wide walls. By concentrating on essential features allowing users to learn how to use them and to assemble models quickly in a completely no-code fashion, especially workflowbased tools are well aligned with the novices' cognitive process. On the other hand, block-based tools adopting a programming approach to the development of ML models are more complex, requiring the students to have a prior understanding of coding concepts and practices. Data flow-based tools, such as Orange or Rapid-Miner, that even enable the user to assemble the ML model from scratch, are mostly used in advanced contexts being designed rather for professional use than K-12 education. And, by providing support for the development of custom ML models, the tools also provide support for a \"high ceiling\", which means that the tools are sufficiently powerful to create sophisticated, complete solutions. Furthermore, to allow students to create their own ML models adopting a computational action strategy to make computing education engaging, it is also necessary that these tools provide a structure for common processes while remaining flexible to account for variability in problems (Patel, 2010) . Considering object recognition being currently one of the most typical ML tasks, the majority of the tools only support the development of ML models for recognition tasks, mostly image recognition. Being one of the most straightforward ML tasks, this seems to be adequate for starting to learn ML. Following the current trend on transfer learning, most of the tools provide adequate support for this technique adopting prominent Deep Learning models, such as TensorFlow.",

Especially workflow-based tools are in alignment with this requirement abstracting the ML process as much as possible. For example, training an ML model in ML4K is reduced to click one action button. These tools are also designed most straightforwardly, limiting the features they offer to only essential ones, leaving part of the process as a black box. Yet, this concealing of ML concepts limits people's ability to construct a basic understanding of ML concepts and seems to not only result in a smaller learning effect but no learning at all (Hitron et al., 2019) . Therefore, the goal has to be to create an ML learning environment with sufficient scaffolds for novices to start to create ML models with little or no formal instruction (low threshold) while also being able to support sophisticated programs (high ceiling). To simultaneously target different kinds of users, some of the tools (i.e., DeepScratch, Google TM, Orange, PIC, SnAIp) offer advanced modes in which they allow more advanced students to define hyperparameters for training (such as learning rate, epochs, batch size, etc.) or more detailed evaluation metrics while hiding these details from novices. Yet, designing these tools, one of the most important decisions is the choice of the \"primitive elements\" that users will manipulate. Future research is necessary to explore this issue and identify the balance between uncovering carefully selected underlying concepts while minimizing the cognitive load as much as possible and adequately support learning progress.",

It also provides the opportunity of an interdisciplinary insertion of ML education in traditional K-12 disciplines as well as supporting education paradigms such as \"computational action\" that aims at learning the creation of useful computational artifacts for social aims, empowering young people to impact their communities by becoming creators in the digital economy (Weintrop et al., 2020) . It can be expected that future research will further explore the vast possibilities of applying ML for different data types and tasks such as object detection and natural language processing including support for a larger variety of tasks and data types by these visual tools.",

For example, although Google Teachable Machine provides code snippets for deploying the created model as a tensorflow.js within a web browser, more detailed and age-adequate educational support teaching deployment on this educational level is not yet available.

This includes for example the provision of instructions and constructive hints as part of the tool environment. And, although some of the block-based visual tools are directly integrated within the same environment in which the deployment of the custom ML models takes place, this is not the case for most other tools. Therefore, a better integration of the visual tools within the deployment environment would eliminate the need for the usage of different tools. Another issue is collaborative learning, commonly adopted in computing education in K-12 by students working together in small groups to maximize their own and each other's learning and motivation (Bellanca et al., 2010; Gillies, 2016; Johnson & Johnson, 2014 ). Yet, we did not encounter any support for developing the ML solutions as a team, which may complicate their application in an educational context in practice. Observing also the popularity of sharing projects as part of several block-based programming communities (such as Scratch), only mblock, as part of their community platform, supports students to share their created ML models and/or to remix ones from the community.",

However, we do not consider this a critical threat to our research as rather than focusing on the impact of these tools, we aimed to characterize the tools themselves. To mitigate the omission of relevant studies, we carefully constructed the search string to be as inclusive as possible, considering not only core concepts but also synonyms. The risk of excluding relevant primary studies was further mitigated by the use of multiple databases and the inclusion of secondary literature. Threats to study selection and data extraction were mitigated by providing a detailed definition of the inclusion/exclusion criteria.

As a result, we identified 16 tools providing a visual interface that allow the students to interact and execute a human-centric ML process in an interactive way. Most of the tools are targeted mainly at beginners at the high school level or K-12 in general. Following design principles proposed by Resnick et al. (2005) , these tools provide a low threshold and wide walls concentrating on essential features to allow users to learn how to use them and to assemble results quickly, while some simultaneously target \"high ceilings\", offering advanced modes that allow the configuration of the ML process. Most tools focus on recognition tasks, providing support for the complete ML process, from data preparation to evaluation using different types of visual representations. The majority of the tools are integrated into common block-based programming languages, allowing for the direct deployment of ML models created as part of intelligent software solutions. Several tools are accompanied by educational units for teaching, yet, most of them are only available in English. Therefore, further educational material is required to facilitate a wider application in other countries considering also locally relevant problems to adequately motivate the usefulness of this kind of knowledge. Furthermore, the tools need to be enhanced in order to support collaborative teamwork and the sharing of the learning outcomes, as well as to provide in some cases a more direct integration with the deployment environment. This also includes the need for support for automatic assessments guiding in a timely fashion the learning process of the students as well as easing the teachers' effort.",
