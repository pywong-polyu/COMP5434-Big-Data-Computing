Most of the available data have indicated 382 thus far a lack of clear synergy for cocktails of mAbs targeting non-competing sites, with the 383 exceptions of S309 and S304 (Pinto et al., 2020) or COV2-2195 and COV2-2130 mAbs (Zost 384 et al., 2020) with the latter combination showing enhanced neutralization potency in vitro, Full occupancy of binding to S trimer by the non-RBM mAb S309.

This model illustrates how the non-RBM mAb S309 may 393 shield S trimers to sterically prevent ACE2 binding on target cells. S309 is the precursor of 394 VIR-7831, recently renamed sotrovimab. 395 396 Role of Fc-dependent effector functions of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing mAbs 397 The relevance of effector functions for the efficacy of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing 398 mAbs in humans is not well established. These could even be detrimental, by enhancing 399 inflammation and therefore disease, at least under certain circumstances. MAbs can recruit 400 immune cells and complement, facilitate the elimination of infected cells that display S at 401 their surface and promote phagocytosis and elimination of opsonized virions. In addition, the 402 formation of immune complexes with mAbs can contribute to enhanced presentation of viral 403 antigens to CD4 + and CD8 + T cells that may contribute to controlling viral infection. The 404 relevance for antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) in the context of a range of different 405 viral infections, including SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, is reviewed in (Arvin et al., 2020; 406 Bournazos et al., 2020b; Lee et al., 2020). Safety analysis in multiple mAb-based ongoing 407 clinical trials for COVID-19 will reveal if ADE is an issue in any of the treatment modalities 408 under investigation. 40913 Several factors may play a role in determining the ability of anti-RBD mAbs to exert 410 Fc-dependent effector functions. The factors are: i) epitope specificities of the mAbs, as 411 previously shown for mAbs against IAV HA and NA (Dilillo et al., 2016; Dilillo et al., 412 2014), ii) orientation and distance of the Fc fragment relative to the plasma membrane (Dilillo 413 et al., 2016; Pinto et al., 2020; Tang et al., 2019), iii) steric hindrance of effector cells, iv) 414 high-density binding of mAbs for efficient Fc\u03b3 receptor cross-linking and engagement of the 415 hexameric C1q and v) the ability of some RBD-specific mAbs to trigger shedding of the S 1 416 subunit and S conformational change, which limit their ability to trigger effector functions 417 (Lempp et al., 2021; Tortorici et al., 2021). Indeed, mAbs that do not promote Fc-mediated 418 effector functions seem to be those mAbs selecting for open RBD states and all are likely 419 triggering S, leading to S 1 (and mAb) shedding. 420 The study of antibody effector functions in vitro does not necessarily correlate with in 421 vivo activity, due to the high complexity of the complement and Fc\u03b3 receptor biology. 422 Protection by antiviral neutralizing antibodies in animal models of Influenza A and HIV-1 423 was shown to require the contribution of effector functions mediated by Fc-Fc\u03b3 receptor (Fc-424 Fc\u03b3R) interactions for optimal efficacy (Dilillo et al., 2014; Hessell et al., 2007). Similarly, in 425 a mouse model of COVID-19 the elimination of effector functions through the introduction of 426 GRLR mutations in the Fc fragment that abrogates binding to Fc\u03b3Rs and complement resulted 427 in a reduced antiviral efficacy in terms of viral load in lungs of infected mice (Schafer et al., 428 2021",

            "text": "Overall, the emergence of resistant variants has at least three constraints: i) the low 490 rate of mutations of SARS-CoV-2 limits the frequency of random mutations to one nucleotide 491 per codon, restricting the spectrum of possible amino acid substitutions at each position. This 492 is further limited by the fact that positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses undergo more 493 transitions in their genomes than transversions. Indeed, a 3 times higher frequency of 494 transitions over transversions was observed in the SARS-CoV-2 genome(Roy et al., 2020;  495   Sarkar et al., 2021); ii) high affinity binding to ACE2 and possibly to other co-receptors or 496 auxiliary receptors needs to be retained for viral fitness. In a recent study, the mutation 497 N501Y found in multiple SARS-CoV-2 VOC was shown to increase by 6-fold the affinity for 498 human ACE2(Collier et al., 2021), and was also associated to an increased interaction with 499 murine ACE2 (Gu et al., 2020), raising the possibility that mutations in the spike may also 500 emerge as a result of inter-species exchange of SARS-CoV-2, like the two-way transmission 501 of SARS-CoV-2 on mink farms observed in Denmark in late 2020 (Oude Munnink et al., 502 2021); iii) mutations shall not affect RBD folding and expression. As an example, the RBD 503 N343 glycan, which is part of the S309 mAb epitope (Pinto et al., 2020), is highly conserved 504 in all sarbecoviruses as well in 100% of the more than 1 million sequences of SARS-CoV-2 505 available to date. The removal of this glycosylation site by mutagenesis resulted in impaired 506 RBD folding, decreased expression as well as in reduced infectivity (Li et al., 2020; Starr et 507 al., 2021a; Starr et al., 2020), most likely explaining its strict conservation. 508 It is possible that the colossal number of infected patients, with very large estimated 509 local seroprevalence at some locations, have imposed an immune pressure on the virus. In the 510 early phase of the pandemic the only mutation in S that became prevalent was D614G and 511 was associated with higher viral loads and younger patient age (Volz et al., 2021). Since 512 November 2020, SARS-CoV-2 has started to mutate more drastically with the accumulation 513 of several mutations and deletions in the RBD, NTD and in the S 2 subunit. This rapid 514 evolution led to the simultaneous appearance of a plethora of SARS-CoV-2 VOC or variants 515 of interest (VOI), such as B.1.1.7 (UK), B.1.351 (SA), B.1.525 (Nigeria), B.1.526 (New 516 York), P.1 (Brazil), B.1.427/B.1.429 (California), B.1.258 (Scotland), and A.23.1 (Liverpool), 517",

            "text": "Prevalence of variants of concern (VOC) over time. Prevalence was calculated 547 based on the cumulative counts of sequences retrieved from GISAID belonging to any of the 548 listed VOC over the total number of sequences deposited by month. GISAID sequences were 549 filtered based on the quality of the sequences (<10% Xs) and the coverage of most of the S 550 sequence (>80% full length). The PANGO lineage designation (Rambaut et al., 2020) of each 551 variant along with the location where they were first identified are indicated on the right. 552 553Overall, immune-evading SARS-CoV-2 variants, that may be defined as a beginning 554 of antigenic drift of SARS-CoV-2, may potentially continue to emerge and co-evolve when 555 herd immunity will be reached, with implications for reinfection, vaccines, and both mAb and556 polyclonal antibody therapeutics. Monitoring resistance of mAbs to circulating new variants 557 will be key to define whether some of the developed mAbs should be discontinued or if 558 different combinations of clinical-stage mAbs should be investigated, as recommended in a 559 recent guideline by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) (FDA, 2021). As a striking 560 example of the effect of the evolution of SARS-CoV-2, in mid-April 2021, Eli Lilly requested 561 revocation of the EUA for bamlanivimab citing an increase in variants resistant to the mAb 562 monotherapy. However, some mAbs in development are not sensitive in vitro and in vivo to 563 the mutations present in the current VOC/VOI due to targeting of highly conserved epitopes, 564 as is the case for VIR-7831, COV2-2196 and other mAbs (Chen et al., 2021b; Dong et al., 565 2021; McCallum et al., 2021a; Pinto et al., 2020; Starr et al., 2021a; Tortorici et al., 2021). 566 Monotherapy approaches are not necessarily inferior to mAb cocktails if they are based on 567 mAbs with high barrier to resistance and optimal coverage of circulating variants. Monitoring 568 the emergence of resistance may be important if single mAbs are used in the clinic but 569 becomes equally important when one of the mAbs of a cocktail is found to be sensitive to the 570 circulating variants. This is already the case for the REGN-COV2, bamlanivimab/etesevimab 571 and ABBV-2B04/ABBV-47D11 cocktails, found to be sensitive to the E484K and/or 572 K417N/T mutations found in the B.1.351, B.1.525, B.1.526, A.23.1 and P.1 VOC (Figure 573 5C). Moreover, regdanvimab (CT-P59), and to a smaller extent etesevimab, showed a 574 reduction in neutralization potency against the B.1.427/B.1.429 VOC, whereas bamlanivimab 575 (LY-CoV555) entirely lost its neutralizing activity due to the central location of L452R in the 576 epitopes recognized by these mAbs (McCallum et al., 2021a). If one mAb in a cocktail is 577 inactive against a VOC, the clinical dosing of the administered mAbs is reduced by half, and 578 the cocktail becomes a monotherapy. 579 580 Figure 5.

Engineered 177 mAbs with dual or triple specificities, as well as with engineered Fc to modulate the 178 adaptive immune response (i.e., vaccinal effect) are under development and results in the 179 coming years will inform on the potential of HIV-1 broadly neutralizing mAbs to provide 180 sustained remission or to represent an ultimate cure for HIV-1 infected patients. The lessons 181 from HIV-1 trials may be relevant for the development of COVID-19 mAbs in that coverage 182 of highly divergent co-circulating viruses is key in the long term and that in therapeutic 183 settings, a combination of mAbs, even if broadly reactive, might be required to prevent viral 184 escape during treatment. However, this may not necessarily apply to acute viral infections 185 and be more an issue in the treatment of prolonged infections in immunocompromised 186 individuals, such as has been observed with COVID-19 (Avanzato et al., 2020; Choi et al., 187 2020; Kemp et al., 2021; McCarthy et al., 2021). Reciprocally, the HIV-1 field might benefit 188 from the knowledge that will be gained from deployment of COVID-19 mAbs, particularly 189 from use of an antibody (VIR-7832, described below) that was Fc engineered to leverage the 190 so-called vaccinal effect, i.e. the boost of T cell responses during infection, as shown for",

In the same study, authors have also shown a lack of correlation between in vitro 429 neutralization and in vivo potency, arguing that neutralization of viral entry in vitro may not 430 be the sole determinant of anti-viral activity in vivo. Another study byDiamond and  431   collaborators showed that in huACE2 mice (K18) and in hamsters, Fc-dependent effector 432functions are dispensable in prophylactic settings, while required for optimal protection under 433 therapeutic settings. In particular, mAbs with wildtype Fc were shown to reduce SARS-CoV-434 2 burden and lung disease in animals more efficiently than mAbs with Fc mutated to abrogate 435 binding to Fc\u03b3 receptors, and required monocytes intervention for therapeutic efficacy 436(Winkler et al., 2021). Of note, studies testing SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing mAbs at limiting 437 doses to reach sub-neutralizing levels did not provide evidence for enhancement of disease, 438 not even when the Fc was modified to match the target host Fc receptors (e.g., hamsterized in 439 hamsters) (Baum et al., 2020a; Cathcart et al., 2021; Lempp et al., 2021; Rogers et al., 2020). 440 Collectively, these data indicate that at least in the animal models and therapeutic modalities 441 tested the antibody Fc can contribute to in vivo efficacy. 442 Due to the initial uncertainty around the beneficial or detrimental role of effector 443 functions, different groups have adopted opposite strategies in the choice of Fc formats for the 444 clinical development of human IgG1 antibody-based products. In particular, 5 of the 14 mAbs 445 analyzed here have been engineered to remove (e.g., LALA or TM Fc mutations) or reduce 446 (e.g., YTE) mAb effector functions, while the remaining were developed as wild-type IgG1 447 (REGN-COV2) or half-life extended Fc versions (VIR-7831 and ADG2) (Figure 2c). VIR-448 7832, which is a derivative of VIR-7831, is an exception as it was further Fc engineered to 449 carry the GAALIE mutation that was previously shown to mediate enhanced dendritic cell 450 maturation and the induction of protective CD8 + T-cell responses against influenza A virus 451 (Bournazos et al., 2020a). VIR-7832 is currently tested in a phase 2 study in parallel with its 452 parent VIR-7831 to assess the potential beneficial effect of the so-called antibody vaccinal 453 effect in humans. The use of half-life extending mutations such as LS or YTE may also 454 contribute to an improved biodistribution in mucosal tissues, such as lungs, as previously 455 observed in non-human primates (Ko et al., 2014). RNA viruses, such as SARS-CoV-2, are evolving biological entities. During the first months 463 of the COVID-19 pandemic a modest rate of sequence divergence was observed, likely due to 464 the coronavirus exonuclease 'proof-reading' activity enhancing replication fidelity (Denison 465 et al., 2011). This initial low level of mutations led the field to underestimate the risk for the 466 virus to escape immunity elicited by vaccines and provided by mAb administration. It was 467 also assumed that targeting the RBM with mAbs could offer the potential advantage of 468 functional constrains for mutations in this region, possibly increasing the barrier to resistance 469 for RBM-directed mAbs. However, the in vitro selection of resistant viral variants from RBM 470 mAbs provided evidence for a high degree of plasticity of this region, leading to the clinical 471 development of several cocktails of non-competing RBM mAbs (Liu et al., 2021b; Weisblum 472 et al., 2020). Deep mutational scanning of all possible RBD mutations (Starr et al., 2020) 473 highlighted the considerable mutational tolerance of this domain although some substitutions 474 are deleterious for RBD expression or ACE2 binding. These analyses were also extended to 475 map the escape landscape of polyclonal antibodies and of several mAbs, including some that 476 are in the clinic (imdevimab, casirivimab, sotrovimab bamlanivimab, etesevimab, AZD8895 477 and AZD1061 mAbs; see Figure 2a for correspondences between initial and generic names of 478 mAbs) (Dong et al., 2021; Greaney et al., 2021a; Greaney et al., 2021b; Starr et al., 2021a; 479 Starr et al., 2021b; Starr et al., 2021c). These in vitro experiments provided evidence that the 480 RBM can accommodate a large set of mutations while retaining or even increasing ACE2 481 binding. The higher frequency of mutations in the RBM over the rest of the RBD (Starr et al., 482 2021a; Thomson et al., 2021) may result from immune pressure, consistent with the 483 observation that antibody responses to the RBD are dominated by anti-RBM antibodies 484 (Piccoli et al., 2020). A similar phenomenon is observed with the highly immunogenic 485 globular head domain of the influenza virus hemagglutinin that evolves faster than the stem 486 region although it comprises the sialic acid receptor-binding site. This process is the basis for 487 antigenic drift and the continuous requirement to update influenza vaccines (Doud et al., 488 2018; Kirkpatrick et al., 2018). 489",
