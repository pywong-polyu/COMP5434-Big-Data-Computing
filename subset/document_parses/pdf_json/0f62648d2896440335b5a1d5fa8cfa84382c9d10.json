According to BIOPEP-UWM\u2122 database of bioactive peptides (formerly BIOPEP), over 4300 BP have been reported to date, which may be classified based on the bioactivity they exhibit, i.e., antimicrobial, antithrombotic, antihypertensive, opioid, immunomodulator, mineralbinding and antioxidants, among others . Such activities have been related to the prevention or treatment of different diseases, including, but no limited to cancer, immune disorders, and cardiovascular diseases (Chalamaiah, Yu & Wu, 2018; Lammi, Aiello, Boschin & Arnoldi, 2019; Skj\u00e5nes, Aesoy, Herfindal, Skomedal, 2021) . Both the composition and the sequence of amino acids are known to be key factors on their bioactivity (S\u00e1nchez & V\u00e1zquez, 2017) . These short chains of amino acids (2-20 amino acids) are encrypted within the parent protein sequence and must be released to exert their effects.",

These methods have been found to be laborious, time-consuming, and expensive on an industrial scale. Hence, new bioinformatic approaches have emerged to obtain and characterize functional peptides, that, unlike conventional methods, can be useful to select the appropriate protease(s) for protein hydrolysis by narrowing down the number of enzyme combinations, to predict possible bioactivity or interaction with specific molecules and receptors by homologybased searches in specific databases and by molecular docking and structural alignments (Agyei, Tsopmo & Udenigwe, 2018) . Therefore, the use of these in silico tools avoids the expense of laboratory time and reagent money. Additionally, they have allowed to find new BP from alternative sources, e.g., kefir milk (Amorim et al., 2019a) , collagen (Nu\u00f1ez, Guzm\u00e1n, Valencia, Almonacid & C\u00e1rdenas, 2020) , fish skin (Elaziz, Hemdan, Hassanien, Oliva & Xiong, 2017) , invasive sea grass Halophila stipulacea (Kandemir-Cavas, P\u00e9rez-S\u00e1nchez, Mert-Ozupek & Cavas, 2019) , Chlorella sorokiniana (Tejano, Peralta, Yap, Panjaitan & Chang, 2019) , cyanobacterium Arthrospira platensis (Ji et al., 2018) , among many others.",

The selection of the protease and the hydrolysis time are decisive factors in the types of peptides to be generated (Daliri et al., 2017) .

Indeed, this biological process has widely been emulated and used to evaluate the formation of BP produced after the consumption of food-protein. In this sense, it has been recognized that this biological process can influence the peptide profile of foods, either by degrading BP or by releasing new ones, which implies that the health benefit of dietary proteins is obtained after the hydrolysis by gastrointestinal digestion (Giromini, Cheli, Rebucci, & Baldi, 2019) . Hence, the impact that digestive process has on the production and presence of BP is highly relevant considering that some of peptides are resistant to digestion, but others are released during its passage through the gastrointestinal tract.

Results showed that different BP were released by simulated digestion, particularly the ACE-inhibitor \u03b2-casein [203] [204] [205] [206] [207] [208] [209] , which increased its concentration 10,000-fold after digestion. Conversely, these results have not been observed in other studies (Mora, Bolumar, Heres, & Toldr\u00e1, 2017; do Nascimento et al., 2021) . Such differences could be related to the digestive model selected, since it has been reported that both the concentration of digestive enzymes and the hydrolysis time used can influence the release and concentration of BP (Daliri et al., 2017) .",

In this same study, authors reported an optimal hydrolysis time of 4 h for bromelain and ficin to obtain antioxidant peptides, although the DH was close to 12%. For this study, papain showed to be more effective to obtain a higher DH at shorter time; however, this does not always ensure a higher bioactivity, since in this case the hydrolysate with bromelain obtained the highest DPPH antioxidant capacity. The authors attributed the differences to the specificity of each enzyme, since papain is a monothiol cysteine endoprotease, and bromelain prefers to break out proteins to poly-and oligopeptides (Holyavka et al., 2019) , having a specificity in hydrophobic and non-polar amino acid residues (Selamassakul et al., 2020) .

Consequently, the application of microbial proteases to obtaining BP from different food proteins has not been long in coming, e. g., alcalase has been used to hydrolyze the proteins of edible insects. In their study, Hall et al., (2018) shown that an 3% enzyme level yield up to 85% DH. However, as previously mentioned, higher DH did not necessarily correlate to higher bioactivity, since antioxidant activity did not show significant differences between hydrolysates with a degree of hydrolysis (DH) ranging from 15 to 85%, whereas ACE and DPP-IV inhibition activities were significant higher for hydrolysates with 60-85% DH.",

Despite of this, microbial fermentation may present certain advantage over other peptide delivery techniques, for instance, the process is cheaper than enzymatic hydrolysis. Besides, peptides with greater biological activities may be generated due to the high diversity of microbial proteases, with high level of It should be highlighted that the type of microorganism used is crucial for optimal production and high bioactivity of peptides obtained. For example, Chi and Cho (2016) , reported the formation of smaller peptides from soybean meal when fermented with Bacillus amyloliquefaciens U304, compared to that fermented with Lactobacillus acidophilus, L. plantarum or Saccharomyces cerevisiae CJ169. This could be due to the presence of a highly active protease in B. amyloliquefaciens. Additionally, an increase in antioxidant activity was found, attributed to the formation of low molecular weight of BP, which proves that the bioactivity also depends on the proteolytic capacity of the microorganisms.",

Some authors haver reported that different factors may intervene in the growth of the fermenting microorganism (e.g. temperature), thereby affecting the DH and therefore in the release of BP. Mazorra-Manzano et al. (2020) described that temperature and time influences the release of peptides with ACE-inhibitory activity during the fermentation of cheese whey with native microorganisms. However, the authors overlook the fact that repeatability is not assured, since it was performed with endogenous microbiota of cheese whey; and as mentioned by Daliri, Lee, & Oh (2018) in a previous research, certain conditions during fermentation, including temperature, time of fermentation, and microorganisms, can result in the production of non-reproducible peptide profiles.",

The method to evaluate this activity consists of determining the amount of hippuric acid formed by a reaction of Hippuryl-L-histidyl-L-leucine with the sample previously incubated with ACE. The quantification of hippuric acid can be carried out using high-resolution reversed-phase liquid chromatography or by spectrophotometry. The results are expressed as ACEinhibitory activity (IC 50 ) (Tsai et al., 2008; Parmar et al., 2018;  Auwal, Zainal-Abidin, Zarei, Tan, & Saari, 2019). Antihypertensive peptides have been shown to contain sequences between 2 and 12 amino acid residues. However, its activity is mainly related to the type of amino acid present in the sequence; for example, peptides that have Pro, Phe, Tyr, or Trp at the C terminal (Auwal, et al., 2019) , as well as Val, Leu, and Ile at the N-terminal, are present in most reported ACE inhibitor peptides (Daskaya-Dikmen, Yucetepe, Karbancioglu-Guler, Daskaya, & Ozcelik, 2017).",

In silico hydrolysis was performed using the Enzyme Action tool in the BIOPEP database (http://www.uwm.edu. pl/biochemia/index.php/en/biopep), with the enzymes subtilisin and pepsin (pH 1.3 and > 2).

First, the protein source is subjected to an in vitro hydrolysis with an enzyme selected according to its known specificity. Afterward, the hydrolysates are assessed by in vitro tests for the bioactivity of interest. Then the peptides are identified and can be synthesized or separated by molecular weight (fractions). Subsequently, the in vitro bioactivity is evaluated again in the peptide previously identified. In case of finding positive results, a promising new peptide should be validated through ex vivo and in vivo studies and, finally carry out clinical trials. While the in silico approach consists of a series of bioinformatics methodologies. Previously known proteins of interest are downloaded from a database (e.g., UniProt), to be loaded into specialized databases on BP (e.g., BIOPEP), where hydrolysis can be performed with different enzymes at the same time. As a result, peptides are obtained, which are evaluated using computational tools to predict their bioactivity (e.g., PeptideRanker), allergenicity (e.g., AlgPred), and toxicity (e.g., ToxinPred). After data analysis, important information can be obtained that indicates the way forward (i.e., proper selection of proteins and enzymes to obtain BP) and, in the case of hybrid approach, these conditions are replicated by in vitro hydrolysis, but also within this approach can synthesize peptides and follow conventional strategies. Subsequently, molecular docking is carried out, where the interaction between peptides and receptor molecules of interest is predicted. However, it has been highlighted that these interactions must be verified by conventional methods, in order to generate a new BP by a hybrid approach.
