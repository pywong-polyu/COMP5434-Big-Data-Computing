Being an ADHD child's parent is a daunting and sometimes stressful job that becomes more challenging during the COVID-19 pandemic and its negative consequences. This cross-sectional study was applied to 54 mothers of ADHD children and adolescents; the data of the ADHD children and adolescents have been registered before the lockdown on their regular follow-up visits on the child and adolescent's clinic of the psychiatry department. Data of the study were collected through an electronic Google form included a COVID-19 questionnaire, The Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale-21 Items (DASS-21) (Arabic version), and Conners' Parent Rating Scale Revised-short version (CPRS-48). We aimed to assess symptoms of anxiety, depression, and stress symptoms among the mothers of ADHD children and adolescents during COVID-19 outbreaks and determine the relationship between these symptoms and the changed circumstances that occurred by the COVID-19 pandemic, also with the behavioral problem of their children that may deteriorate by their mothers' psychological state.",

In total, 29.6% of the mother of ADHD children had confirmed COVID-19 cases among their family members, while 11.1% of our subjects lost a family member due to this epidemic, 22% of our sample lost their work because of COVID- 19 . We found that the COVID-19 pandemic has a big financial drawback on the family of our participants by a percentage of 31.5%. We noticed that 48.1% of our sample documented domestic violence toward them compared to before COVID-19. A total of 92.6% of the mothers who participated in our study assessed the period of change and restrictions as being very demanding. We found that 74.1% of ADHD patients were not compliant with their medications than before the epidemic. Also, we found that the mothers of ADHD children have bigger challenges in managing the child's meals, structured activities, and sleep compared to before COVID- 19 . We showed that 53.7% of the mothers had depressive symptoms, 61% had anxiety symptoms, and 53.7% had stress symptoms. These symptoms were statistically associated with the lost family member due to COVID-19, the financial drawbacks of the COVID-19 outbreak, and the domestic violence toward mothers, compared to before COVID-19, the non-compliance of their children on the medications compared to before COVID-19, the presence of confirmed COVID-19 cases among family members, mother's assessment of the period of change and restrictions as being very demanding compared to before COVID-19, and the non-compliance of their children on the medications compared to before COVID-19 as well as the increased behavioral symptoms of their children. Conclusion: COVID-19 pandemic has psychological influences on mothers of children with ADHD. A significant number of them may have depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms that could affect their children's compliance with the medication and, consequently, their symptomatology.",

Gerdes et al., in their study, assumed that experiencing these events and, as a result, having increased pressure led mothers to be unable to react to the child's negative behavior [8] . This interferes with the ability of the mother to solve problems and further enhancing their depressive symptoms. Related to these theories, being in the COVID-19 pandemic is a major life-threatening problem. And as the coronavirus pandemic progresses quickly worldwide, there is a significant amount of uncertainty, worry, and concern in the general populace and, precisely, among some populations, such as older adults, caregivers, and people with pre-existing medical or mental conditions. To date, excessive levels of depression and anxiety are the significant psychiatric consequences of public mental health. However, recent interventions, especially quarantine and its effects on many people's habits, schedules, or livelihoods--are also predicted to increase anxiety, stress, depression, unhealthy alcohol and substance use, and self-harm or suicidal behavior [9] . Quarantine brings an overload of psychological stress, several neuropsychiatric symptoms [10] . Home isolation has an acute and lasting psychosocial effect on children, particularly ADHD children, because of the significant changes in their lifestyle and physical activity [11] .",

This association is not only understood by the manifestations of ADHD themselves but also explained by the multiple issues associated with child ADHD, including oppositional defiant disorder or learning disabilities [17, 18] . Since the COVID-19 pandemic and its negative consequences, this has become more complicated. Children with ADHD were not likely to get adequate educational help. Many of these children's parents may be considered not to be experts in the field of education. Still, they are forced to be responsible for educating their children in addition to struggling with all the children's emotional and behavioral problems 24/7. Furthermore, the COVID-19 pandemic has been a big battle for everyone, including parents. Their anxiety about this event could even increase the psychological and behavioral problems of the children [19] . That is why incidents of child abuse, negligence, oppression, and domestic violence are on a horrid increase during the COVID-19 pandemic and its quarantine [20] . In this research, we intended to assess symptoms of anxiety, depression, and stress symptoms among the mothers of ADHD children and adolescents during COVID-19 outbreaks and determine the association between these symptoms and the changed circumstances that occurred by the COVID-19 pandemic, also with the behavioral problem of their children that may increase during the pandemic.",

It is a quantitative measurement scale of depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms (each calculated by seven phrases) over the previous week. The subscales measure depression symptoms (e.g., life was meaningless), anxiety symptoms (e.g., trouble relaxing), and overall stress symptoms (e.g., feeling rather touchy). Every mother involved in the research should decide how intensely each of the statements of scales applies to her with a score from zero to three where 0 is \"never felt,\" 1 is \"feels it to a degree or some degree,\" 2 is \"feels it to a substantial amount or to a great deal of time,\" and 3 is \"feels it too much and most of the time.\" The scaling scores are as follows: (0-9) for depression is recognized to be normal, mild (10-13), moderate (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) (19) (20) , and severe and very severe cases are scored (\u2265 21), (0-7 for anxiety) are accepted as normal; (8-9) for mild cases, moderate to very severe cases are scored (\u2265 15), and scoring stresses; (0 \u221214) are considered normal, and (15-18) for mild cases, (19\u221225) scores means moderate cases while severe to excessively severe cases (\u2265 26). The Arabic translation was handled by Taouk Moussa et al. [24] . An Egyptian study announces the findings of a differential item functioning analysis of the DASS-21 in a group of Egyptian drug consumers with a coefficient alpha of 0.883 and inter-item correlations of (0.249) [25] . In our study, the (DASS-21) scale (Arabic version) was tested for content validity by two panels of the Psychiatric Department experts. These experts assessed the tool for clarity, relevance, comprehensiveness, applicability, and understanding. The reliability of the scale was tested by measuring its internal consistency. It demonstrated an excellent level of reliability (Cronbach's alpha = 0.84).",

They could be a continuous cause of disruption for family members, and families can also have difficulty managing them [32] . The study of Coghill et al. [33] and Yousefia et al. [34] believed that raising a child with ADHD is a great stress for parents. In normal circumstances, what about the frustrating situation associated with the COVID-19? We aimed in our study to assess symptoms of anxiety, depression, and stress symptoms among the mothers of ADHD children and adolescents during COVID-19 outbreaks and determine the relationship between these symptoms and the changed circumstances that occurred by the COVID-19 pandemic, also with the behavioral problem of their children that may deteriorate by their mothers' psychological state. We conducted our study on 54 participants of the mothers of ADHD patients. Our research identified that (22%) of the participating mothers lost their work because of COVID-19, while 14.8% of the fathers lost their job because of COVID-19. Also, we found that the COVID-19 pandemic has a big financial drawback on the family of our participants by a percentage of 31.5%.",

This study revealed that the period of change and restriction related to COVID-19 was associated with worsening of ADHD symptoms in the form of increased conduct, learning, impulsive hyperactive, and particularly the psychosomatic and anxiety problems in these patients during the pandemic as compared to before it. Furthermore, the problems remained in a large number of children. Just a few children showed any improvement in their behavioral difficulties over the lockdown time. ADHD patients have poor tolerance for ambiguity, making it difficult for them to follow instructions and comprehend the complexities of the pandemic scenario. According to Cortese et al., the imposed situation at home and the hostile setting, which alters their usual pattern, may raise the likelihood of more severe hyperactivity and impulsive behaviors. Also, this worsening of symptoms is consistent with the disorder's nature and the constraints enforced as part of the shutdown [47] .",

Also, the cross-sectional design of this study failed to analyze the direction of the effect of the psychological state of the mothers on the behavioral symptoms of their children. Another limitation was the small sample size which is still less than expected according to previous studies. We were constrained by the available number of records in our clinic as the lockdown measures unenabled us to increase our sample size. Also, the lockdown measures prevented us from performing a structured psychiatric interview to diagnose the psychiatric disorders that may present in our participants or apply specific questionnaires instead of the subjective questions for assessment of certain points like the financial impacts and the domestic violence as this study was done through an electronic Google form questionnaire not face to face interview, so we were not able to use multiple questionnaires as many of our participants may find difficulty in completing it. So, we tried to make it as concise as possible and at the same time give us accurate data regarding our sample and what we try to assess in our study.",
