Throughout the evolution of the pandemic, governments around the world responded by implementing different measures to contain the viral spread, including instituting home confinement and travel restrictions, as well as limiting capacity in indoor spaces. UNESCO data indicate that, in early April 2020, these restrictions led to closures of schools and higher education institutions, including universities, in 185 countries. These closures affected 1,542,412,000 learners, constituting 89.4% of total enrolled learners [1] .",

The fact that the universities were closed greatly impacted higher education institutions and their attending students. To minimize the impact of this situation on the~1.5 million attending students, the Spanish university system adapted to allow students to finish their academic courses online [3] . In line with such changes, in September 2020, the University of the Basque Country in Spain began a new academic course using blended learning for health sciences students, combining in-person and remote classes. This model was implemented because, on the one hand, large class sizes were difficult to hold in person due to social distancing requirements and, on the other hand, specific practices discussed in these courses cannot be taught remotely and require in-person interaction.",

The selection criteria for participation in the study were: being a nursing or medical student at the beginning of the second year or a physiotherapy student at the beginning of the third year, and to complete the questionnaire in person. In September 2019, we recruited 132 nursing students at the beginning of their second year of the nursing degree program (the response rate was 82%), 128 medical students at the beginning of their second year of the medical degree program (the response rate was 37.5%), and 49 physiotherapy students at the beginning of their third year of the physiotherapy degree program (the response rate was 89.1%). In October 2020, 149 nursing students, 260 medical students, and 47 physiotherapy students completed questionnaires, resulting in 92.5%, 76.0%, and 85.5% response rates, respectively. On all occasions, we gave all students who wanted to participate in the study the opportunity to do so. Thus, the final sample consisted of 113 nursing students, 109 medical students, and 45 physiotherapy students who completed both pre-and post-questionnaires (2019 and 2020).",

Normality distribution of the quantitative variables was evaluated using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Quantitative variables were presented as mean and standard deviation and qualitative variables were presented using absolute frequencies and percentages. To analyze the difference between MedDiet scores, moderate and intense physical activity, and eating habits before and during the COVID-19 pandemic, a nonparametric bivariate analysis was performed using a Wilcoxon signedrank test. Paired t-tests were used to calculate mean differences (MD) by subtracting before versus during the COVID-19 pandemic with a confidence interval (CI) of 95%, so a negative result reflected an increase in the values. To compare paired proportions between adherence to the MedDiet and physical activity frequency before and after the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, a McNemar test was performed. Statistical significance was determined when p < 0.05.",

Study subjects included 267 health science university students, of whom 64 were male (24%) and 203 were female (76%). When classifying students according to where they lived and with whom they lived, the majority (70.8%) lived in cities with more than 20,000 inhabitants and with their parents and siblings (74.7%). Most participants were single (86.5%). The vast majority of parents of health sciences students had very high education levels. Specifically, 59.1% of mothers and 45% of fathers had received higher levels of education. When assessing participant adherence to the MedDiet, we observed a significant improvement in adherence during the COVID-19 pandemic versus before (p < 0.012; MD, \u22120.240; 95% CI \u22120.044, \u22120.436; Table 2 ). Of note, the mean score before the pandemic was just at the cutoff (9 points) between low and good adherence to the MedDiet. When further analyzing only participants with good adherence to the MedDiet (scores \u22659), we observed that adherence increased from 61.4% to 68.2% when assessed longitudinally (p < 0.005). We found no differences in the frequency or intensity of physical activity (Table 3) . Despite slight increases in moderate (p < 0.311; MD, \u22120.050; 95% CI \u22120.051, \u22120.151) and intense (p < 0.318; MD, \u22120.043; 95% CI \u22120.042, \u22120.128) physical activity during the pandemic, the results are not statistically significant. Abbreviations: CI, confidence interval; MD, mean difference; SD, standard deviation. Table 4 shows changes in the intake of different food groups. Of note, the consumption of vegetables increased significantly during the pandemic (59.8% to 65.8%; p < 0.048). We also observed that the consumption of fatty meats tended to increase (68.8% to 75.9%; p < 0.061). We observed the same trend for the consumption of nuts (56.2% to 62.2%; p < 0.076).

            "text": "The MedDiet, known worldwide for its health benefits, is characterized by a high consumption of fruits and vegetables, olive oil, and nuts. Consistent evidence supports the association of the MedDiet with lower mortality and reduced risk of cardiovascular disease [11, 12] . In fact, during the COVID-19 pandemic, the MedDiet was recommended for strengthening the immune system [13] . We found an initial MedDiet adherence score of 9.03 \u00b1 1.69 points among university students, indicating that participants had good dietary habits before the pandemic. Other similar studies examining the dietary habits of university students demonstrated lower or similar scores to those observed in the present study [8, 14, 15] ; however, we did not find any studies demonstrating higher scores. These data are relevant if we compare them with those of the COVIDiet [7] study performed in an adult population during the confinement period in Spain. The scores of our student population were much higher than those observed in the COVIDiet study [15] , where participants scored an average of 6.53 \u00b1 2 points before the pandemic and 7.3 \u00b1 1.93 points during home confinement between March and April 2020 [2] . One explanation for these differences between the two studies, as indicated in the DIMERICA study [16] , may be that adherence to the MedDiet is affected by different aspects, such as place of residence and education level, and involves not only dietary patterns but also lifestyle, sociocultural, cultural heritage, and environmental aspects. In our study, the percentage of parents with higher education was high, especially for mothers (59.1%). Some articles suggest that the mother's education level is positively associated with the degree of adherence of their children to the MedDiet [17, 18] . In addition, our observations coincide with those reported in other studies suggesting that dietary choices for children and adolescents are made mainly by the mother [18] . Therefore, mothers with higher education levels may influence their children's dietary choices by making certain foods available and accessible, as well as by being a role model. It is also possible that a higher academic status is associated with higher income and, consequently, a greater availability of healthy foods [19] .",

This increase was mainly due to the increased consumption of vegetables and nuts, which are two of the most characteristic components of the MedDiet. Our results are consistent with most studies [8, [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] which agree that vegetable consumption increased during the pandemic, although G\u00f3rnicka et al. (2020) reported a higher percentage of people who decreased vegetable consumption [25] . This increase in vegetable consumption may be related to a higher frequency of food purchase, and it is possible that this increase is also associated with the perception that, in conditions of confinement, it is necessary to eat healthier. In the same sense, other studies [7, 8] note that the sale and consumption of legumes, vegetables, and fruits increased significantly after the onset of the pandemic. During the COVID-19 pandemic, people have spent more time at home and take more time cooking than before. In fact, recipe searches on Google skyrocketed [26] .",

One of the hypotheses for observed increases in physical activity is that the environment in which students live affects their sedentary behavior patterns [27] . Rather than being an obstacle, the effect of a restricted social life has benefitted the practice of physical exercise. In the case of health science students, another factor to consider is that their training in promoting healthy habits may have influenced their decision to exercise at home [28] . However, as in our study, the percentage of people who did not engage in physical activity also increased slightly during the pandemic, as did sedentary time [28] . In line with these findings, Di Renzo et al. observed that the lockdown increased activity among people who were active occasionally before the pandemic because they spent more time at home, but those who did not undertake any exercise before the pandemic did not use the situation as an opportunity to start [8] .",

Thus, the fact that participants tend to underestimate negative parameters and over-report positive ones must be considered.

However, this limitation does not preclude reliable results. Third, this study was designed to be conducted face-to-face to ensure the reliability of the reported information. Thus, one of the selection criteria was that the students complete the questionnaire in person, or else unequal attendance in the different grades could have led to a selection bias.",

Given the uncertain course of the COVID-19 pandemic in the months and years to come, the findings presented here provide valuable information for planning and implementing interventions aimed at maintaining healthy lifestyles in young adults, and thus preserving their health. Indeed, our results indicate that when students do not have to attend university every day and spend more time at home, their adherence to the MedDiet improves. Strategies should be explored to maintain greater adherence to the MedDiet when the pandemic ends and students return to face-to-face classes. Encouraging and facilitating the consumption of vegetables and nuts at the university could be a good strategy to improve adherence to this diet in the future. To this end, it would be advisable for vending machines in the faculties to always offer the option of nuts and fresh fruit. In addition, university menus should always include vegetable-based dishes at an affordable price for university students.",
