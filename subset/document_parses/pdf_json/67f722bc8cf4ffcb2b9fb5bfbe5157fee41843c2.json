            "text": "A broad spectrum of molecular testing in medicine influences patients' diagnoses, treatment, and/or prognoses. Thus, physicians and other medical staff need to balance these requirements and cost procedures that influence the budget of medical institutions and insurance companies. Pathologists use a wide spectrum of analysis daily. However, immunohistochemistry is the routine that is performed at a high volume every day. Thus, seeking new approaches to increase the volume of IHC stained slides while decreasing the laboratory costs and time spent on manual application of IHC protocols led pathologists to introduce the automated process into their laboratories [1, 2] . However, despite numerous advantages of automated IHC labeling, which allows better standardization [3] [4] [5] , reliability, and reproducibility of IHC, particularly in the clinical setting [6] , the introduction of an innovative automated immunostaining has never undergone profound analysis of its efficacy, and only suggestions and speculations of costs and time reductions exist [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] . Automation improves performances in clinical laboratories [12] , but it still represents a great challenge, considering the implementation of numerous changes required for the successful automation of procedures, involving a completely new approach to managing the existing processes. Moreover, it is very important to choose carefully the type of innovative equipment that will automate the process, either completely or partially [13, 14] . IHC staining cannot be completely automated, since there are several steps in the IHC protocol that depend on manual work [15] . This process is considered the process of partial automation, whereas a fully automated process would be conducted completely by machines, including all steps during biopsy sample preparation for further IHC procedure. These steps are acquisition of formalin-embedded paraffin-fixed tissue blocks, their cutting using microtome, slide labeling, and IHC staining. Finally, fully automated procedures would also require quality control as well as slide delivery and interpretation [7] . However, regardless of these disadvantages, partial automation is extremely important because it allows laboratory technicians to be focused precisely on specific activities that require their expertise, skills, and concentration, while routine activities could be performed by machines through the automation process [16, 17] . In addition to the aforementioned economic benefits, the optimization of the process achieved by automation has an exceptional significance considering turnover rate and shorter time to obtain the histopathological results, allowing physicians to get precise diagnoses and act in a timely manner by prescribing the appropriate treatment [18] . Numerous laboratories for clinical microbiology that automated some or most of their processes have found that testing can be done accurately, while reducing the time required for analyses, improving laboratory efficiency, and increasing flexibility in terms of skill levels required to perform laboratory work [1, [19] [20] [21] . Furthermore, new technologies create the ability to perform steps that could not be performed by manual work for any reason. Automation of processes enables reduction of human mistakes, allowing successful processing independent (or dependent to a lesser extent) on human knowledge, skills, and expertise [22, 23] . Finally, both patients and institutions would achieve great benefits. Patients would get quick and accurate results, while institutions would have higher turnover rates and be able to create new jobs.",

The key question became how to ensure sustainability and stability in the continued work of the laboratory with limited and reduced resources. Considering that the healthcare system was extremely affected in every segment, in addition to the available resources in terms of professional staff, special attention is paid to the financial effects. The COVID-19 pandemic caused a decrease in the capacity of the laboratory considering professional staff, due to their redistribution to other places within our healthcare system; reduced staff due to illness and prolonged absences from work; as well as increased analyses due to reduced capacity in related laboratories.

For the current experimental design, both manual and automated runs were performed with four different antibodies, in order to make direct comparisons of two procedures accurate as far as possible. In real daily situations in the lab, an automated IHC single cycle is usually performed with the most frequently used antibodies by our pathologists, and an automated immunostainer mostly works with four to six different antibodies. On the other hand, real manual run IHC protocols involve many different antibodies performed by one technician, thus slightly increasing the time required for reagent preparation, such as dilution of numerous antibodies. The total procedure time in the automated process for full capacity working (48 slides) is fixed at the maximum volume, and it slightly depends on the hands-on time during the preparation steps and at the finalization of the staining procedure ( Table 1 ). The total IHC procedure time to run 48 slides manually by one technician was 460 min (7 h 40 min), while the automated process finished a cycle within 390 min (6 h 30 min), resulting in 15.22% less time to finish the cycle.

However, this is almost negligible considering the high annual volume of IHC slides performed in an automated immunostainer (12,000 slides). It is important to mention that due to the complete cost-effectiveness of the use of the equipment, the automated immunostainer never turns on unless there is a sufficient volume of microscope slides. So, the automated immunostainer always works at full capacity. The cost of an annual automated immunostainer service was 0.08 EUR per slide. Table 4 describes in detail all the variables that influence the final cost of an IHC slide.

Although it has been previously suggested by other researchers that automation could reduce total costs of IHC [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] , for the first time here, we performed profound and precise calculations involving direct comparison of automated procedure and manual process. Similarly, Zanatta et al. observed savings from 55 to 89% for an automated FISH analysis procedure compared to costs in manual procedure [26] . Regardless of the type of analysis in a molecular pathology laboratory, these results indicate significant cost savings using automated processes. However, there are still suspicions concerning the introduction of automation in IHC laboratories worldwide. Most concerns relate to staff numbers, which usually remain the same; therefore, the salary costs remain and the investment in an automated immunostainer is believed to be an additional cost, increasing the budget of the department. However, our current study clearly indicates that investment in equipment does not increase the overall budget, since long term usage, despite depreciation and annual service costs, saves a significant amount of money.",

Altogether, these results are significant, as IHC is often considered a labor-intensive methodology and therefore cost and time savings, and ease of use are high priorities for IHC users [27] . Since the modern molecular pathology laboratories are continuously requested to accommodate higher testing volumes and increasing numbers of biomarkers and technologies, through robust automation, laboratory staff can accommodate more assays, produce more reliable results, and increase hands-free time for other important tasks. Moreover, a low turnover analysis rate produced in non-automated laboratories would be improved by the implementation of automated procedures, thereby producing higher analysis volumes of higher quality, with decreased total costs and reduced technicians' workload [27] . Considering also social aspects, patients would be more satisfied with the decreased time required to obtain a final histopathology report that usually depends on IHC analysis and which significantly affects further therapy options and disease outcomes.",

At our institute, there is annual preventative maintenance, which also covers unpredictable costs and services during the year. Nonetheless, the system operates robustly and thus far has not malfunctioned or required any significant maintenance. Thus, as presented here, these maintenance costs increased the price per microscope slide by only 0.08 EUR, which can almost be neglected. The current study is a specific example of when automating IHC was applied in this particular laboratory.
