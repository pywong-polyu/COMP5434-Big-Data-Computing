Data are drawn from a 2017-21 classroom-close study of enactment of such courses in 13 fairly representative centres, using an institutional ethnographic approach. The pandemic picture was generally one of the significant and sustained negative impacts, though over the course of the study, respondents reported progress in addressing early limitations in the harnessing of digital platforms for learning. A small number of participating students reported home-based study beneficial for their mathematics learning, and a bigger group identified some wider benefits that partly offset the challenges. Most participating 16-18-year-old students, though, reported finding remote learning of mathematics both demanding and limiting. Pandemic constraints impacted most strongly on opportunities to engage with newer emphases within A Level courses: problem solving, reasoning, modelling, statistics and mechanics. Receiving academics reported that mathematical preparedness, and confidence, for mathematics-intense university courses has also been widely affected, with a bigger range of preparedness and confidence than usual. The study draws attention to the importance of studying subject-specific impact and drawing on student as well as teacher perceptions. It exposes a range of consequences of the cancellation of examinations and a need to develop and share effective pedagogies for working remotely with pre-university students.",

As a key subject, progression in mathematics-specific attainment, even if somewhat coarsely assessed, has received some attention. In England, generic studies have found that teachers were often professionally ill-equipped to pivot to remote teaching. Individual schools' responses have diverged, and students' engagement with learning opportunities offered has also varied considerably, often exacerbating existing underprivilege. There has also been some small-scale mathematics-focused work (e.g. Hodgen et al., 2020; Royal Society and Joint Mathematical Council, 2021; Drijvers et al., 2020) . Such studies complement pre-existing evidence on school closure periods and on fulltime remote learning (e.g. Gill, 2015) . Earlier evidence pre-dates recent progress in access to digital technologies for learning. The reported study is therefore distinctive in offering mathematicsspecific, digitally imbued, 'stories' of pandemic impacts on students approaching transition to university.",

They also need a capacity to transfer and adapt face-to-face mathematics teaching capacity to the new medium, redesigning familiar teaching approaches for remote (synchronous or asynchronous) use (Smith & Bretscher, 2018; Ruthven, 2009) . However, at a pre-university level in England, sustained and systemic use of remote digital teaching and learning had not in March 2020 been well developed. Many teachers were not well equipped or pedagogically or technologically knowledgeable about moving their teaching online (Ofsted, 2021) . It might be reasonable to assume that most 16-18 year olds in an affluent country, the subjects of this study, would be 'digital natives', as well equipped and mature as any school-age students to engage with, and possibly benefit from, the affordances of those technologies. However, students, also, need not only access to and fluency with the technology used: even more than in face-to-face learning, they depend on intrinsic motivation and self-regulation for learning (Education Endowment Fund, 2020).",

Students themselves had identified enhanced organization for learning as a benefit. While the data suggest that many universities could perhaps usefully revisit their approach to supporting transition, these responses from academics do very much point to what might be missed when the usual structures and roles of examinations are suddenly removed. Teachers and students in centres offered supplementary data relating to perceived impact on learning of the use of centre-or teacher-assessed grades in place of external examinations, and it is to those we now turn. Year 12 students, the second cohort considered, had experienced use of centre-assessed grades (CAGs) in year 11. These were largely based on centres' existing assessment data, moderated by a variety of teacher and managerial inputs that differed between centres. Some reports of perceived 'unfair' calculation of CAGs were strongly expressed, though only 2% of responding students thought their progression to year 12 had been directly impacted. At least an additional 4% thought the grades awarded might later have an adverse impact on their progression to university. Looking forward given their continuing-disturbed teaching in year 12, about a third of students thought standard A Level examinations were the 'fairest' method of assessment despite learning having been lost, with some concerned about loss of credibility from CAGs. Another third thought that in similar circumstances in the future, focused teacher-run assessments would be preferable and often argued that such an approach supported steady application through the course. The remainder had more mixed views, with some proposing innovative solutions that combined teacher assessment and examinations.",

Within distance learning as operationalized by teachers in this study, and the somewhat constrained in-centre practice adopted to accommodate pandemic-safer working, many newer and highly valued aspects of the specifications remained both marginalized and more difficult to teach and learn in meaning-making ways.

Further, a minority of students from a variety of backgrounds have continued to experience significant constraints on their productive working because of limited technological access. It is easy to imagine that these older, digital generation school and college students are likely to be minimally affected by such challenges, but this would appear not to be the case. Even where there are not technological or practical impediments, remote and isolated learning of mathematics makes very different cognitive, emotional and organizational demands from many of the digital activities with which these young people engage. Where there are financial or working space issues, families reluctant or unable to make additional or newer technical investment, or poor internet access, equitable solutions are not obvious. Limitations in access to work experience, to enrichment opportunities, to university visits and 'widening participation' opportunities in a pandemic, as well as 'imposter syndrome' consequences of cancelled examinations, are also likely to impact hardest on students from disadvantaged or under-represented backgrounds.",

The exceptions were students in those three centres already making significant use of blended approaches to learning. However, teachers and students both reported progress with the range of such issues, via the expanded use of technological affordances, over time, and especially evident during the early 2021 home learning period. However, the constraints of technological access and domestic constraints during fulltime home learning continued to limit students' access to enhanced remote provision. Throughout the pandemic to July 2021, it remained the case that the evidenced degree and detail of pandemic impact was highly variable by individual student.

Indeed, the validity and reliability of teacher-sourced summative assessments remains an open question (Torrance, 2018) . Going forward for the affected cohorts, it is important that learning opportunities in both preuniversity and university settings offer alternative routes that support consolidation and synthesis of learning and credible affirmation of learning. This might also address a wider question, namely whether high-stakes examinations are themselves productive of an unhealthy dependence on them for catalysing productive learning.

Going forward, it will be important to establish how the evidenced general and mathematicsspecific affordances of technology to support learning can be harnessed and developed further over time, and some of the constraints addressed. It would also be helpful to learn from those contexts where more progress is being made. The subject-specific impacts on students' learning, as well as on them more widely, including on their mental and emotional health, should be recognized and addressed: those are likely to affect progression for some time to come. The study has also focused attention on some constructive impacts of the examination system in catalysing synthesis of learning, and as trusted accreditation of that, while simultaneously bringing into focus some constraints of the current reliance in English mathematics assessment on terminal written papers. Findings suggest that a more mixed assessment economy might better support the development of highly valued aspects of mathematics functioning, as well as greater validity of some outcomes.
