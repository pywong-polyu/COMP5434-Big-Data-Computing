These limitations have encouraged the search for alternative techniques for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 7 . Among them, LAMP (Loop mediated isothermal amplification) has gained popularity due to its high specificity, sensitivity, simple protocols, more tolerance to inhibitors and potential to deliver results without the use of expensive instruments [8] [9] [10] . These advantages make it ideal for decentralized testing and surveillance of human pathogenic agents (e.g. Dengue 11 , MERS 11 , and HIV 12, 13 ).",

BstLF DNA sequence from the OpenEnzyme collection was cloned into pET15b with a 6x His-tag at its N-terminus. The BstLF sequence in the Open Enzyme collection was obtained from Geobacillus stearothermophilus (GenBank U23149, UniProt P52026). The large fragment (LF) was selected between the amino acids 298-876 of the full length protein. The wild type BstLF sequence was then codon optimized for E. coli through the OPTIMIZER 29 web server, using the E. coli codon usage from the HEG database and a guided random method. Sequences were verified by Sanger sequencing services from Eton Bio and full sequence files are provided here 30, 31 . Both DNAs can be obtained from the Open Bioeconomy Lab and/or FreeGenes collection 32 . M-MLV and BstLF were expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) and C41 respectively and purified following two open access protocols described in detail on the protocols.io Reagent Collaboration Network (ReClone) collection 33,34 . Briefly, protein production was induced with 0.5 mM IPTG for 16 hours at 18 \u00baC at 200 rpm after plasmid-containing E. coli cells grown in ampicillin-supplemented LB media reached OD 600 = 0.8.

            "text": "A variety of isothermal DNA amplification techniques have recently been developed and present themselves as highly versatile molecular biology tools to enable simple, in-thefield screening assays or point of care clinical diagnostics. Unlike traditional PCR, these reactions can be carried out at a constant temperature; eliminating the need for a thermocycler. Among these approaches is RT-LAMP, which has emerged as a promising and simple diagnostic tool for identifying SARS-CoV-2 9 . Advances on detection methods for LAMP reactions have described a series of alternatives with different degrees of equipmentdependency (or none), such as turbidity, gel electrophoresis, calcein, colorimetric indicators, pH-sensitive dyes, and DNA-intercalating fluorescent dyes (e.g. SYBR Green, SYTO dyes, EvaGreen) 44 . Our implemented protocol relies on the use of intercalating dye EvaGreen, as it has been shown to perform better than SYBR green 45, 46 . A potential limitation of our proof of concept method is that the use of intercalating dyes can make target-specific real-time detection challenging 44 , and could pose as a barrier for use in resource limited areas. Future lower resource implementations of our method could substitute EvaGreen for 100-200 \u00b5M halochromic dyes, like Cresol Red, in pH 8.8 buffered reaction mix to cause detectable colorimetric change when amplification products have been produced 47 . Alternatively more advanced detection methods utilizing sequence specific methods based on the use of probes (e.g. LAMP-BEAC 23 , OSD 48 , DARQ 49 and QUASR 50 ) could also be utilized as end-point detection methods, and remain to be tested in future work. Such methods would be advantageous as they could be multiplexed for different targets in the same reaction.",

These concentrations were used for further assays and final tests with clinical samples.Homebrew reaction tested with clinical samplesTo address the potential use of in-house prepared RT-LAMP reactions for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 from patient purified RNA, we tested16 positive samples (8 of high and 8 of low Ct RT-PCR values with primer set N1 and N2) and 8 negative samples with NEB WarmStart commercial kit and the homemade BstLF/M-MLV RT-LAMP reactions. The samples corresponded to RNA extracted from nasopharyngeal clinical samples (Fig. 1C). Although both reactions, commercial and homemade, were able to detect high viral load samples (i.e. low Ct values), negative samples tested with commercial enzymes showed no amplification in any tube (0/8) whereas homemade enzymes exhibited one false positive (1/7). Samples with low viral load (i.e. high Ct values), on the other hand, were more likely to be classified as negatives with both systems (4 out of 8 in commercial reactions and 3 out of 8 in homemade reactions). A careful analysis of melting curves showed that the positive results presented the expected curve for the target, indicating non-spurious amplification of the specific sequence (data not shown but provided in the Zenodo repository link with raw . The reactions from negative clinical samples (i.e. negative RT-PCR reaction) were classified as negative with the commercial RT-LAMP system whereas one tube was classified as positive in the homemade system. The melting curves showed that the positive result presented the expected curve of the target (i.e. not an amplification of spurious nonspecific sequences), as it was the case for the two RT-LAMP negative results with Tt values between 40 and 60 min, indicating a possible cross-contamination from other tubes. Positive control reactions were correctly classified as positives in both systems. Negative controls (NTC) were correctly classified with the commercial system whereas the homemade reaction misclassified one tube as positive. The melting curves showed that the positive result presented the expected curve of the target (i.e. not an amplification of spurious non-specific sequences), indicating a possible cross-contamination from another tube. Nevertheless, the time to threshold of false positives are clearly different from positive samples; indicating that a proper Tt selection (e.g. 30 min) should differentiate them. Although the analysis of melting curves suggests the absence of spurious unspecific amplifications, the homemade system provided faster times to threshold than the commercial reactions, which can be prone to deliver false negatives in reactions with high loads of nontarget RNAs such as clinical samples 22 . Nevertheless, these results demonstrate that RT-LAMP reactions composed of in-house purified BstLF and M-MLV have comparable performance to commercial kits. The costs of consumables for the homemade reactions (USD 0.36 per reaction) is one order of magnitude cheaper than the costs of reactions with commercial enzymes (NEB WarmStart kit USD 3.86 per reaction and NEB RTx and Bst2.0 WarmStart enzymes bought separately USD 3.38 per reaction), enabling the development of more affordable alternatives for diagnostics. These results are in agreement with recent publications demonstrating the use of homebrewed enzymes for RT-LAMP detection of SARS-CoV-2 from patient samples 15,22,28 . These efforts have demonstrated the use of in-house",

US7056716B2 51 ) with anticipated expiration date of 15 March 2021. Future work will, therefore, explore the use of off-patent enzymes Open-MMLV or HIV RT 15 from the E. coli expression toolkit from ReClone initiative 52 in order to have freedom-to-operate in any country. The use of public domain enzymes would also permit commercial partnerships seeking to scale-up production locally. ReClone is a reagent collaboration network that addresses this challenge by providing access to open protocols and off-patent reagents for diagnostics under more permissive material transfer agreements (openMTA 53 ), mitigating shortages as well as building preparedness in the long-term. Overall the Open RT-LAMP approach presented here demonstrates a viable method to replicate the detection sensitivities of traditional commercial RT-LAMP protocols at a fraction of the cost and with minimal resources. While we demonstrate the utility of the Open RT-LAMP protocol in the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA isolated from clinical samples, this approach could easily be applied to a broad range of screening assays to identify other infectious diseases or common pathogens at low cost. Our open RT-LAMP protocol aims to contribute to the global effort of making diagnostic capabilities more distributed, affordable and equitable.

Positive controls correspond to 10.000 copies of a ssRNA fragment from the Nucleocapsid (N) gene. Threshold not reached label corresponds to RT-LAMP reactions that did not amplify its target during the whole time of testing.
