Method: Between April 22nd and June 21st 2020, Saudi adults aged \u226518 years voluntarily completed a selfadministered web-based cross-sectional survey, distributed through social media (WhatsApp) and emails to representatives in education, health, business, and social sectors across all Saudi Arabian regions. The survey included questions on anxiety level, COVID-19 risk perceptions and adoption of preventive measures. Weighted percentages, Pearson's chi-square tests, and multiple logistic regression were applied to evaluate associations between these factors and socio-demographic variables. Results: A total of 2393 respondents completed the survey. A majority (74%) were worried about the COVID-19 outbreak and of those, 27% reported that it was likely that they would be infected with COVID-19; 16% believed it would be life-threatening or severe. However, only 11% of respondents reported high anxiety level. Adoption of hygiene practices and social distancing were lower among older (> 65 years) compared to younger (18-24 years) respondents (OR: 0.06; 95% CI: 0.01, 0.28 and OR 0.06; 95% CI: 0.01, 0.27 respectively). High percentages of respondents reported being able to (88%) and were willing to (82%) self-isolate. Those with the lowest gross household income and those with at least one flu symptom were less able and willing to self-isolate. A significant increase in levels of anxiety, perceived effectiveness of social distancing and hygiene practices was reported in the post-lockdown compared to during the lockdown.",

Examples of such suppressive measures included closure of schools and worksites. Suppressive measures had shown short term success in China and South Korea [5] . The key aim of suppressive measures was to reduce the average number of secondary cases each COVID-19 case generated, known as the reproduction number or R, to below one. This was intended to reduce the number of cases or eliminate human-to-human transmission [5] . However, as this was a temporary measure to reduce the peak of the COVID-19 outbreak, the question remained for how long and how many times such measures would need to be enacted. Applying these suppressive measures over a long period of time was thought to be likely to have a substantial economic and social impact [6, 7] .",

Identifying risk perception will not only help mitigate the devastating mortality and morbidity burden, but also economic loss. With the relatively long period needed for the majority of the population to be vaccinated against COVID-19 and the emergence of new COVID-19 variants [8] [9] [10] [11] , understanding and addressing behavior to reduce transmission and spread of infection is imperative [12, 13] to avoid further spikes of new cases and unavoidable enforcement of lockdowns [14] . Such insight will help identify population groups with relatively low risk perceptions or low adoption of preventive measures and enable the design of policies and interventions tailored to these populations. It will allow governments to strengthen key public health messages and design health awareness campaigns tailored to the different stages of an outbreak [5, [15] [16] [17] [18] . Furthermore, gaining insights into risk perception and behaviors can help build community resilience and influence behavior to increase uptake of future vaccination and/or treatment [5, 13, [15] [16] [17] [18] .",

Each section was displayed separately, and respondents had to respond to each item before moving on to the next section. Respondents could go back to edit previous answers, but once they submitted the survey they were not allowed to change any of their responses. On average, respondents spent 15 min to complete the survey.",

Additionally, a request to circulate the survey to their mailing lists was sent to different institutions and organizations representing the main sectors in the community: education (e.g. public and private universities), health (e.g. Saudi Arabia Center for Disease Control), business (e.g. Council of Saudi Chambers), and social (e.g. Family Affairs Council) sectors across all Saudi Arabian regions. A web-based survey was used as it was likely to capture a greater number of harder-to-reach individuals than a paper survey [21, 22] especially during the lockdown period where access to people was limited . In addition, according to the Saudi Communication and Information Technology Commission, WhatsApp was the most widely used social media application [23] . A 2017 report by Statista showed that Saudi Arabia's WhatsApp penetration rate was around 73%, which is one of the highest worldwide [24] .",

As a result, a sample size of 2180 is sufficient to cover all gender and age ranges of the adult population. Age and gender were considered for post-stratification weights to compensate for the fact that people with certain characteristics were not as likely to respond to the survey [26] . Non-response weights were also used to compensate for bias in the final sample. The weight that combines age and gender is calculated by the rate between population and initial sample proportions of each age and gender range (%). The initial sample corresponds to 4067 individuals that answered the survey (complete and incomplete responses). The weight of the non-response is the rate of the proportion in the initial sample to the proportion in the final sample (complete responses). The final weight is the product of both weights.

Agreement scores on the translation were obtained by three bilingual researchers (GA, FA and SA) with experience in survey development and methodology. All the researchers used a Likert scale of 5 points with the values 4 and 5 corresponding to substantial or strong agreement, respectively. The Kappa value, which was significantly different from zero indicated agreement (p = 0.004) and the agreement scores presented a mean = 89.6%, median = 91.7%, min = 75% and max = 100% implying an almost perfect agreement. Next, pretesting and cognitive interviews were conducted on a subgroup of 23 respondents (not included in final analysis) following the WHO steps for translating instruments and to ensure all questions and responses adapted to the Saudi Arabian context were clear [29] .",

Most respondents reported that they were worried about the spread of COVID-19 and believed that if they were infected it would be either a moderate infection that requires bed rest or a severe one. Around 11% reported high anxiety levels in 14 days prior to participating in the survey. The level of anxiety postlockdown was higher than that during the lockdown period, accompanied with an increase in the perceived effectiveness of hygiene practices and social distancing to reduce the chances of COVID-19 infection. Washing hands frequently with soap and water and avoiding crowds and social events were reported as the most adopted measures to protect oneself. While protecting others involved mostly covering one's nose and mouth while sneezing or coughing rather than wearing a mask.",

Unlike the study based in the UK, but similar to the study based in HK, the perceived effectiveness of preventive measures and their adoption was high in this study. This might reflect the experience Saudi Arabia and HK had with the previous epidemics of SARS [33] and MERS [34] , respectively. Also, the first case in Saudi Arabia was reported later than these countries and the survey was distributed a month later, so respondents had the opportunity to learn the positive experiences of other countries with high adoption of preventive measures through news and other forms of media.",

This study found that official websites and their social media platforms were commonly used to seek information about Covid-19 in Saudi Arabia. Adoption of social distancing measures was higher in Saudi Arabia (98%) compared to the UK (45.2%) [27, 28] and HK (range: 39-93%) [17] . The greater use of official websites and level of adoption of social distancing measures might be explained by the differences in context, timing and duration of data collection. In Saudi Arabi, the survey was available for almost two months during lockdown and post lockdown; additionally, the government used a transparent approach by having a large media presence and awareness messages provided by Saudi Arabia's Ministry of Health on a daily basis through their scheduled media conferences [4, 35] . The effect of their approach is clear in this study with official websites and their associated social media outlets being used as the main source of information and perceived as the most reliable source of information by the majority of respondents. That might reflect trust in the government, which was reported by another cross-sectional study that assessed Saudi Arabian population's trust and compliance with measures enforced by the government to prevent or reduce COVID-19 transmission during the early phase of the pandemic and found high levels of trust [36] .",

This finding contradicts the findings of the study in the UK, where social distancing was adopted more amongst those aged 70 years and older [27, 28] . This association between age and adoption of preventive measures has been explored in other studies and it showed inconsistencies across different countries and during different pandemics [28, 33, 37, 38] . In addition, perceived susceptibility levels were also lower among this age group, and that was similar to a survey conducted in Germany where the elderly reported lower risk perception [39] . This might be related to optimism bias where people expect better results than reality [40] (i.e. in the case of Saudi Arabia, there might be a belief that the risk is low if they are practising some degree of preventive measures). Moreover, in Saudi Arabia, religious beliefs tend to have a stronger effect on elderly health behaviors and perceptions [7] . As for the differences in gender, females tend to have higher perceived susceptibility and adoption of preventive measures compared to males across studies [17, 33, 37, 38, 41, 42] . Females also had higher levels of anxiety compared to males, which was also measured in another study conducted in Saudi Arabia during the pandemic [43] . The same study showed that those practising social distancing or hygiene practices were less likely to report anxiety, but this was not seen in the present study [43] . Even for certain older age groups who had lower anxiety levels compared to the younger age groups, they were not practising preventive measures. Respondents in the higher income groups were less likely to worry about the pandemic, as they were more likely to be educated and less likely to be affected by the impact of COVID-19 pandemic in terms of employment and household finance compared to those in the lower income group due to existing inequalities that were heightened by the pandemic [44, 45] . The difference in perceived susceptibility and severity between the higher and lower income groups might be due to the former having better access to accurate/reliable sources of information while the latter group are more likely to be exposed to misinformation about COVID-19 [46] .",

In addition, temporal changes were investigated as the pandemic progressed and the government's suppressive measures changed. The survey tool used in this study was also applied in other international research groups, which may enable cross-country comparisons. The translation process followed the WHO guidelines for translating instruments [29] and used quantitative and qualitative methods to ensure a rigorous process. As for the limitations, the study design does not allow for causal inferences. Most of the participants were from urban areas which might have affected generlisability of results, although most of the COVID-19 cases were located in Riyadh and Mecca (both large urban cities). The online method might have excluded an important group of the population (the elderly, people with learning disabilities or those without access to the internet), who might have been equally or more vulnerable to COVID-19, also, self-reported data may be a possible source of error. Response bias might be an issue, this was reduced through making the survey anonymous and participation voluntary. Furthermore, the sample was obtained through convenience sampling and contained people from a higher socio-economic status, which might potentially exclude the deprived socio-economic groups and other groups that did not or were unwilling to fill the survey.",

            "text": "This study has certain implications for public health and health policy. The most prominent one is the trust that people have in the government recommendations in Saudi Arabia. This was highlighted when the majority of the respondents reported official government social media accounts and websites as their first trustworthy source of information, and the reason for adherence or adoption of preventive measures was based on government recommendations; other cross-sectional studies showed similar favorable attitudes toward the government during the early phase of the pandemic [36, 47] . The willingness of the public to report their symptoms to health authorities and the high rate of preventive measures adoption might be to some degree influenced by government efforts. Social media and websites of health authorities were effective means of spreading key Covid-19 related messages and as they were commonly used by many different population groups in Saudi Arabia. These communication channels should be used when promoting non-pharmaceutical interventions and Covid-19 vaccinations or treatment when available [48] [49] [50] . The temporal differences in anxiety levels between lockdown and post lockdown might indicate a need for well-being intervention programs and a focus on designing health awareness messages that do not raise anxiety to the degree that could increase the burden of poor mental health associated with the pandemic worldwide [43, [51] [52] [53] . Furthermore, the heighted anxiety and poorer mental health caused by the pandemic might need to be further addressed through increased universal and targeted access to mental health support and services at national level.",

            "text": "Another point to consider is how to facilitate the process of self-isolation which is currently recommended for those with mild COVID-19 symptoms or those who were in contact with a COVID-19 case in Saudi Arabia [3] . There are certain factors that were associated with a decrease in willingness or/and ability to self-isolate that need to be targeted. The first one was having at least one flu symptom in the last 14 days of filling the survey, people who had symptoms were less likely to be able or willing to self-isolate; that might have reflected their own experience. The second involves those with the lowest category of income compared to others. Those two groups need to be targeted to facilitate their adoption of self-isolation as they are more likely to be [1, 3, 17, 28] . While taking into consideration the most common worries with regard to self-isolation, e.g. inability to provide food and medication or inability to self-isolate from family members or those living in the same household. Interventions or programs to provide practical support e.g. delivering food and medication to those who are self-isolating especially those with no help available from friends and families or are economically disadvantaged, need to be available. Examples of such services may include help with grocery shopping, collecting medication from pharmacies, and befriending services for people who suffer loneliness. Public health officials also need to use strategies for identifying and communicating with at-risk populations (specifically the elderly) through site visits to nursing homes, senior citizens centers, and similar settings hosting this at-risk group. They also need to prioritize research in areas of elderly COVID-19 perceptions, particularly around barriers and facilitators to adherence to preventive measures.",

For Saudi Arabia specifically, research interest during COVID 19 is oriented more toward epidemiology and understanding the disease's pathway and treatment. However, it is important to understand why older population and those with lower socio-economic status have lower risk perception and adoption of preventive measures compared to the younger population. By understanding their perceptions and barriers, interventions can be developed for these groups informed by evidence. And understanding how people in general perceive risk of the disease and react to system and individual level preventive measures for the control of future outbreaks is urgently needed and can be gained through the use of qualitative studies [19] .",
