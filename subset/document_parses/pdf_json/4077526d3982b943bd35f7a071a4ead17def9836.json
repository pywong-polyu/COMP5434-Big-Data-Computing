For example, feedback from online conferences suggests that having a digital component (e.g., recordings) can increase accessibility by reaching audiences that would be unable to attend otherwise, those who have disabilities, and those who are neurodiverse [20] . Additionally, conferences can support the attendance of underrepresented individuals by raising funds for those individuals and by encouraging invited speakers who do not need the funding to return their travel money on the condition it supports the travel of diverse trainees (Fig 1) .",

We suggest that providing equal opportunities to diverse trainees to present at conferences, write reviews/research articles, and engage in networking events may potentially help retain trainees in our community. An example of this inequality is that trainees who do not descend from 'science power houses' may experience lower attendance at their posters/talks. As a result, membership in prestigious and well-connected lab lineages amplifies disparities in the community. To promote interactions within the community, we encourage organizers of conferences to design structured networking schemes that encourage all scientists to interact either at random or in a categorized fashion, thereby encouraging the inclusion of underrepresented individuals (Fig 1) . Examples of innovative networking schemes include the \"meet the speakers/experts\" lunch at FASEB conferences and the name tag ribbons at Genetics Society of America conferences that allow attendees to proudly declare groups they identify with and their goals (e.g., on the job market, recruiting trainees, editor) encouraging interactions.",

There remains extremely low visible representation of other groups including people of color, members of the LGBTQ+ community, people with physical disabilities, and neurodiverse individuals [24] [25] [26] [27] . The lack of representation of underrepresented individuals in leadership positions (e.g., department chairs, PIs, and group leaders) can discourage diverse trainees from pursuing academic careers [28] [29] [30] .

Research experience is usually unpaid or underpaid, thereby excluding economically disadvantaged students who cannot afford to work for little or no salary. Because of this, we recommend normalizing compensation for undergraduates with economic needs either by increasing work study opportunities to include research or paying minimum wage. Increased compensation will increase diversity in STEM through expanding the number of research opportunities for those with financial barriers [7, 8] . In addition, the financial cost of the Graduate Record Examination (GRE) and application fees are barriers during the graduate school admissions process (Fig 3) [33, 35] . Although the GRE requirement is becoming less frequent, we recommend that graduate programs that have not yet done so, abolish the GRE requirement as it discriminates against underrepresented groups and is not predictive of career success [36, 37] . Given that many applicants are not aware of the option of waiving application fees or are concerned about negative consequences associated with asking for a waiver, we recommend graduate programs have clear policies for needbased fee waivers or eliminate fees entirely and that they make such policies transparent. Additionally, graduate programs need to be transparent about stipend and relocation costs as underrepresented individuals may be disproportionately less able to afford relocating [38] .",

Some institutions have variable salaries but even at those with clear salary tiers, startup package negotiations can lead to unequal resources (e.g., funds, lab space, etc.) for new faculty and unseen inequality between faculty. This inequality can create large disparities in productivity and affect retention and tenure [55] . To help ameliorate this, we recommend that negotiation training for graduate students and postdocs become a standard part of their training. We also strongly encourage senior faculty to advocate for junior colleagues to prevent disparities. Furthermore, departments and institutions should develop consistent, fair, and transparent hiring processes.",

This is especially an issue at the postdoctoral level as postdocs are usually on yearly contracts and have fewer benefits compared to permanent employees. Herschberg et al highlight the problems of haphazard institutional policies for postdocs [57] . Furthermore, there are examples of active discrimination against women of childbearing age as some advisors are worried about the loss of productivity that occurs with family leave and whether trainees will be 'serious' about their careers [47] . One action item that was discussed as a solution to increase retention of trainees who feel they must choose between academia and children is to provide more financial support (either internally or externally) to support a technician to cover a trainee's work during family leave. For example, the NIAID has a program to give a supplement for this purpose (https://grants.nih. gov/grants/guide/pa-files/PA-18-926.html), we encourage other grant giving institutions to support similar initiatives. More recently, NIH issued a notice providing graduate students and postdocs that hold a Ruth L. Kirschstein NRSA access to funds to support childcare costs (https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-21-070.html). Increasing support during family leave will also help combat hiring discrimination that occurs against trainees who are perceived to want children.",

For example, the scarcity of underrepresented individuals in the scientific community may deter feelings of inclusion [9, 60] . Hence, increasing the number of diverse individuals in our labs and institutions is absolutely critical to achieving retention of these groups in academia. To specifically increase retention of diverse faculty in tenure-track positions, we recommend deliberate and targeted recruitment of postdocs from underrepresented groups with dedicated financial and space commitments from institutional leadership. One way to accomplish this is through cluster hires as they can promote diversity and support inclusion and retention. Flaherty describes the substantial benefits to the establishment and maintenance of diversity using a cluster hire [61] . Other strategies to enhance diversity in faculty positions have been highlighted and discussed in [6] . Finally, these efforts should not be viewed as fulfilling a quota or an imposition of a new source of bias, but instead as a measure to counterbalance longstanding biases that have hampered the inclusion and promotion of brilliant colleagues.",

These groups include, but are not limited to, members of the LGBTQ+ community, people with disabilities, first generation students, and neurodiverse individuals. People with disabilities can find themselves excluded from labs that are not physically set up to accommodate them [25] . Furthermore, those with disabilities can be at a disadvantage at events such as large conferences that require standing and walking for long periods of time. As a community, we need to be aware of seen and unseen disabilities and work to increase access to labs, conferences, and institutions. It should also be noted that members of other underrepresented groups are not easily identified and may be afraid to 'out' themselves for fear of discrimination. As a result, the issues these groups face are mostly unknown and unrecognized. A great example of change occurring within the publishing community is the creation of new policies to allow name changes on publications for transgender and non-binary individuals [62, 63] . Policies like this help educate the community about barriers particular groups face while providing a solution. However, there are many bigger steps which need to be taken to make members of these often-overlooked groups feel welcome in science.",
