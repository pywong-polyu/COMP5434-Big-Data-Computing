            "text": "Background: Nutrition therapy is essential in critically ill adults. Little is known about appropriate nutrition therapy in patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019 infection. Methods: This was a retrospective, observational study in adult patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection receiving mechanical ventilation. Data regarding patient demographics and nutrition therapy were collected. Patients that received enteral nutrition within 24 hours of starting mechanical ventilation were compared with patients starting enteral nutrition later. The primary outcome was inpatient length of stay. Propensity score matching was conducted to control for baseline differences in patient groups. Results: One hundred fifty-five patients were included in final analysis. Patients who received enteral nutrition within 24 hours received a significantly greater daily amount of calories (17.5 vs 15.2 kcal/kg, P = .015) and protein (1.04 vs 0.85 g/kg, P = .003). There was no difference in length of stay (18.5 vs 23.5 days, P = .37). The propensity score analysis included 100 patients. Following propensity scoring, significant differences in daily calorie (17.7 [4.6] vs 15.1 [5.1] kcal/kg/d, P = .009) and protein (1.03 [0.35] vs 0.86 [0.38] g/kg/d, P = .014) provision remained. No differences in length of stay or other outcomes were noted in the propensity score analysis. Conclusion: Initiation of enteral nutrition within 24 hours was not associated with improved outcomes in mechanically ventilated adults with COVID-19. No harm was detected either. Future research should seek to clarify optimal timing of enteral nutrition initiation in patients with COVID-19 who require mechanical ventilation.

            "text": "Nutrition therapy plays an important role in the management of critically ill patients. Significant delay in initiation of enteral nutrition with accumulation of caloric deficit has been associated with more nosocomial infections, longer length of stay, and higher mortality. [1] [2] [3] 4 Enteral nutrition is the delivery route of choice, as it promotes gut integrity and reduces systemic inflammation when compared with parenteral nutrition. 5, 6 Guidelines recommend initiation of enteral nutrition within 24-48 hours of onset of critical illness in patients who cannot take in nutrition orally on their own. 7, 8 Although early nutrition intervention is widely accepted as standard of care, much is unknown about optimal nutrition therapy practices. Although some studies have found that early, aggressive calorie provision via enteral nutrition is beneficial, other studies have demonstrated that trophic or hypocaloric feeding may yield similar outcomes. 9,10 Early use of parenteral nutrition to meet 100% of caloric goals has not been shown to significantly improve outcomes. 11, 12 The optimal amount of nutrition provision is especially controversial in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome and acute lung injury (ALI). One randomized controlled trial in patients with ALI found no benefit to full enteral nutrition as opposed to trophic feeding for the first 6 days of mechanical ventilation. 13 Another randomized controlled trial in patients with ALI was terminated early because full nutrition was associated with higher mortality. 14 Like many other therapeutic modalities, the role of nutrition intervention in critically ill patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is poorly understood. Previous literature in ALI suggests that early, goal enteral nutrition does not improve outcomes. However, others have suggested that because of the severity of inflammation and illness observed in patients with COVID-19, risk of acquiring malnutrition may be higher. 15 Additionally, patients with COVID-19 may have had poor oral intake for days prior to admission. Statements from nutrition societies have recommended early consideration of parenteral nutrition in patients with COVID-19 who cannot tolerate enteral nutrition. 16, 17 The objective of this study was primarily to associate provision of early enteral nutrition with outcomes in mechanically ventilated patients with COVID-19 and secondarily to describe practical nutrition practices in mechanically ventilated patients with COVID-19.",

Total calorie intake from enteral nutrition, protein supplements, intravenous (IV) lipids via propofol, IV continuous dextrose infusions, and parenteral nutrition was totaled each day. Total protein intake was also calculated each day. Concomitant use of enteral nutrition and vasopressor administration was recorded, in addition to instances of bowel ischemia within 24 hours of these concomitant therapies. Owing to staffing limitations and limits of staff exposure to patients, calorie intake was not recorded in patients that were able to tolerate a diet within the first 7 days following mechanical ventilation. Use of a prokinetic medication, defined as metoclopramide or erythromycin, was recorded. Days of severe hypophosphatemia (defined as a serum phosphorous level below 2 mg/dL) were recorded. Days with hyperglycemia (defined as a blood glucose reading >180 mg/d) and days with hypoglycemia (defined as a blood glucose reading <70 mg/dL) were recorded as well. Blood glucose levels were obtained from serum values, point-of-care readings, or blood gases. For patients receiving IV vitamin C, point-of-care readings were disregarded owing to inaccuracies in readings. Ideal body weight was calculated using the Hamwi method. For this analysis, weight-based daily provision of calories and protein was calculated using ideal body weight for all patients. In clinical practice, registered dietitians recommended weight-based protein and calorie goals using ideal, actual, or adjusted weight based on clinical judgement. Modified Nutrition Risk in Critically Ill (NUTRIC) scores were also retrospectively calculated for all patients using laboratory values drawn within 24 hours after initiation of mechanical ventilation; all modified NUTRIC scores were conducted without incorporating interleukin-6. 21 Outcomes were compared between patients who received enteral nutrition within the first 24 hours of starting mechanical ventilation at the study institution and patients who initiated enteral nutrition at a later time. The primary outcome of the study was to compare inpatient length of stay in patients in whom enteral nutrition was initiated within the first 24 hours of mechanical ventilation vs patients with later initiation. Secondary outcomes were measured at 60 days after admission and included inpatient mortality, days alive and free of mechanical ventilation, tracheostomy, and discharge on oxygen in patients who received enteral nutrition within the first 24 hours of mechanical ventilation compared with patients with later initiation. 16 Additionally, patients were compared based on receipt of at least 15 kcal/kg/d (using ideal body weight) of nutrition vs <15 kcal/kg/d. The value of 15 kcal/kg/d was chosen because it has been suggested as a possible minimum calorie target for patients in the acute phase of critical illness. 22 Inpatient length of stay, inpatient mortality, days alive and free of mechanical ventilation, tracheostomy, and discharge on oxygen were also compared between patients who received at least 15 kcal/kg/d and patients who received <15 kcal/kg/d.",

These variables were selected because differences either likely predisposed patients to a poor outcome or indicated a higher severity of illness. Patients were included in the final propensity score analysis based on a match tolerance of 0.1. After propensity score matching was completed, 100 patients were included for analysis. Following propensity score matching, no differences were found for standardized mean differences and each covariate assessed.",

            "text": "In this retrospective study of mechanically ventilated patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, patients presented with a high severity of illness, as evidenced by high baseline APACHE II and SOFA scores in addition to low P:F ratios. Over 70% of patients had a modified NUTRIC score of \u22655, which indicates that they may particularly benefit from aggressive nutrition therapy. Despite this, initiation of nutrition support within 24 hours of mechanical ventilation was not associated with improved clinical outcomes. The results of this study conflict with previously published data. A meta-analysis conducted by Marik and colleagues demonstrated that early enteral nutrition was associated with fewer infectious complications and a reduction in inpatient length of stay. 2 Similarly, Doig et al also demonstrated a reduction in pneumonia and mortality when enteral nutrition was started within 24 hours, in a separate meta-analysis. 1 Both of these meta-analyses pri-marily included studies conducted in surgical and trauma patients. Medical patients, such as those with COVID-19, may not derive a similar benefit from very early nutrition. Although less than half of the overall cohort was fed within 24 hours of mechanical ventilation, nearly 70% of patients started enteral nutrition within 48 hours, which aligns with current guideline recommendations. Thus, the relative delay in initiation of nutrition observed in this study may not have been long enough to contribute to patient outcomes. Future studies could investigate if delaying enteral nutrition for 48 hours in COVID-19 patients affects patient outcomes. In this study, patients who initiated enteral nutrition within 24 hours of mechanical ventilation were compared with a later initiation of enteral nutrition. This selection of the 24hour cutoff may be controversial. The current recommendation in COVID-19 patients is to initiate enteral nutrition within 12 hours of starting mechanical ventilation. In the experience of the authors, the 12-hour threshold can be challenging to meet in the setting of surge staffing, and the significance of a 24-hour threshold was thus studied instead.",

These small differences may, in part, explain why early nutrition did not impact outcomes. However, similar outcomes were observed when patients were compared with those who received a daily calorie provision of at least 15 kcal/kg. The Permissive Underfeeding or Standard Enteral Feeding in Critically Ill Adults (PERMIT) trial compared permissive underfeeding to standard feeding in critically ill adults. Patients in the permissive underfeeding arm received 46% of goal calories compared with 71% in the standard-care arm, with no differences in outcomes observed. 23 The Initial Trophic vs Full Enteral Feeding in Patients with Aute Lung Injury (EDEN) trial compared initial trophic with full enteral feeding in patients with ALI and found that a greater calorie provision did not increase the number of ventilatorfree days or reduce mortality. 13 Early parenteral nutrition in patients with contraindications to enteral nutrition has also been examined in a randomized control trial. Patients receiving early parenteral nutrition received more calories and protein per day, yet no differences mortality, length of stay, or complications were observed. 11 Aggressive nutrition has also been shown to potentially harm outcomes in patients with ALI.

            "text": "To the knowledge of the authors, this is one of the first reports describing nutrition support for COVID-19 patients in the United States. The results of this study have implications for the care of critically ill COVID-19 patients. Despite a high severity of illness, it was still possible to deliver enteral nutrition to these patients often within 48 hours of being intubated. The presence of gastrointestinal symptoms on admission did not appear to limit the ability to provide enteral nutrition once mechanically ventilated in this cohort. However, the severity of these gastrointestinal symptoms is unclear, given the retrospective nature of this study. Over 70% of patients received enteral nutrition despite also receiving vasopressor medications. This practice was associated with an excellent safety profile, as no patients developed bowel ischemia that required intervention. Although greater calorie provision was not associated with improved outcomes in this study, very few patients received 100% of goal calories. Previous trials have demonstrated that it is very challenging to provide 100% of goal calories with conventional enteral nutrition strategies alone. 12, 13 Volume-based enteral nutrition strategies or supplemental parenteral nutrition may be necessary to provide 100% of caloric goals in this patient population. More research is necessary to clarify the role of parenteral nutrition in patients with COVID-19. An ongoing prospective, observational trial examining caloric needs in mechanically ventilated COVID-19 patients, using indirect calorimetry, should provide more information. 26 This study does have several limitations. Nutrition assessment was limited by an inability to examine patients and perform nutrition-focused physical assessments. Oral intake prior to admission was likewise often unclear. It is possible that many patients, after several days of experiencing COVID-19, presented with poor oral intake and that they were already at a significant calorie deficit prior to the initiation of mechanical ventilation. A supplemental multivitamin was not routinely administered to patients during the first 7 days of mechanical ventilation. Owing to the retrospective nature of this project and documentation inconsistencies, gastric residual volumes, vomiting, and the decision to stop enteral nutrition on the basis of gastric residual volumes could not be assessed. Glucose control was challenging in these patients. Insulin infusions were generally avoided because of the need to frequently enter patient rooms to check glucose levels and adjust infusion rates. Overall incidence of hyperglycemia in these patients was nevertheless higher than ideal. Because of the risk of infection spread and surge staffing, daily calorie counts were not recorded for patients that were extubated and eating. This study is subject to the limitations inherent to retrospective evaluations (bias, confounding variables, etc). However, we attempted to minimize the impact of these limitations through the use of propensity score matching. Following propensity score matching, differences in calorie and protein provision still existed despite no apparent differences in severity of illness. These differences in enteral nutrition provision could be attributed to heterogeneity in practice among different providers. However, other undetermined variables that were not collected may have contributed to nutrition provision as well.",
