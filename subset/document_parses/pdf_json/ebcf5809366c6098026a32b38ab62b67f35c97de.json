This results in na\u00efve estimators which can be very far from the truth.In this work, we present a method that removes these two sources of error directly. Moreover, our procedure can be easily extended to the stratified error situation in which a test has very different error rate profiles for symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals as is the case for rapid antigen testing. The result is an easily understandable four-step algorithm that produces much more reliable prevalence estimates as demonstrated on data from the Israeli Ministry of Health. Thus it may re-open the debate about whether we are under-valuing rapid testing as a surveillance tool and may have policy implications in Third-World countries or disadvantaged communities",

Serological tests, by their counting of antibodies are more apt to detect past COVID-19 infection, and rapid antigen tests and PCR tests can detect current viral infection. However, since rapid antigen tests are known to have very high false negative rates amongst asymptotic individuals, [1] they have fallen out of favor as as surveillance tool and are preferentially used now to test symptomatic individuals and to determine whether that individual is infectious or not. This is a shame because rapid tests can be much more easily deployed, can be administered at home, do not require lab-based assays, and are much more cost effective. This could have made them ideal tools to use particularly in Third-World countries, which remain vulnerable to the virus due to persistently low vaccination rates.",

[4] The world has thus relied mostly upon convenience or surveillance sampling (i.e. not random sampling) to estimate the prevalence of the disease. Convenience here implies that typically there is over-sampling of symptomatic individuals, and since the probability of testing positive for these individuals is higher than for asymptomatic individuals, this results in an over-estimation of the population prevalence using the biased sample na\u00efve prevalence estimate of the proportion in the sample who tested positive.",

Interestingly, the third group, corresponding to the na\u00efve estimator of symptomatic and non-infected individuals is nonzero, since false negatives will make the na\u00efve estimate positive. On the other hand, notice that the na\u00efve estimators in the left-hand side are determined by the testing errors and the sampled individuals of each group. Therefore, if the sample is not random, there will be bias. This is easy to see when we assume that there is no error in testing, in whose case the previous na\u00efve estimators are the total sampled from each group. In fact, to reflect our initial hypothesis of overrepresentation in the sample of the symptomatic group, we assume that p I (1) 1 \u2265 q \u2265 1/2.
