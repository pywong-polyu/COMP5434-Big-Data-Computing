A double-sided strip silicon Tracker gives a precise measure of the first Compton scatter interaction and tracks of pair-conversion products. A novel CdZnTe Low Energy Calorimeter with excellent position and energy resolution surrounds the bottom and sides of the Tracker to detect the Compton-scattered photons which enhances the polarization and narrow-line sensitivity. A thick CsI High Energy Calorimeter contains the high-energy Compton and pair events. The instrument is surrounded by a plastic anti-coincidence detector to veto the cosmic-ray background. We have performed detailed simulations to predict the telescope performance and are currently building a prototype instrument. The AMEGO prototype, known as ComPair, will be tested at the High Intensity Gamma-Ray Source in 2021, followed by a balloon flight in Fall of 2022.

To enhance the Compton scattering cross-section, and to minimize the effect of Doppler broadening on the angular resolution, 6 a low-Z detector material should be used for the first Compton scatter interaction. However, the photon must be fully absorbed to measure the total energy of the event, so a high-Z material should then be used around the scattering detector to enhance the chance of photoabsorption for the Compton-scattered photon. In the pair regime, high-Z materials promote pair-conversion, while thin layers of a low-Z detector material are ideal for tracking the pair-products. Typically this is handled by combining layers of high-Z conversion foils with position sensitive detectors, similar to the design on the Fermi-LAT. 7 However, these high-Z foils limit the angular resolution and energy measurements at lower energies due to multiple scattering; therefore, a pair telescope optimized for the MeV range should use the tracker detector material itself as the converter. The pair event must be fully contained to determine the energy, so a thick high-Z absorber detector should be used under the tracking layers to measure the initial gamma-ray energy.",

Both interactions require fine position resolution (typically \u223cmm) in the scatterer or tracker, while the resolution elements of the absorber detector are not as critical to the reconstruction. Additionally, Compton event reconstruction necessitates a precise measure of the energy deposited (typically \u2206E/E of a few %) in the scatterer, and both event types require a spectrally-sensitive absorber.",

Figure 1 illustrates how a Tracker and Calorimeter geometry work to detect both event types. At energies less than \u223c10 MeV, a photon will predominantly Compton scatter in the Tracker layers, and the Compton-scattered photon will then be absorbed in the Calorimeter. By a precise measure of the interaction position and energy deposited in the Tracker and Calorimeter, the standard Compton equation can be used to determine the Compton scatter angle \u03b8 of the first interaction, which constrains the initial photon direction to a circle on the sky called the \"event circle.\" An added advantage of using a tracking detector is that the direction of the Compton-scattered electron can be measured if it subtends multiple layers, and with this additional kinematic information, the initial direction of the gamma ray can be constrained to an arc on the sky, as opposed to a circle. At energies greater than \u223c10 MeV, a gamma ray will predominantly undergo pair conversion in the Tracker, and the path of the electron-positron pair can be tracked to determine the initial direction of the photon. The Calorimeter contains the electromagnetic shower that develops as the electron-positron pair enter the high-Z detector volume to give the total energy in each event. Additionally, the position sensitive absorber allows for the shower profile to be imaged, which provides an important background discriminator and allows for reconstruction of events that are not fully contained.",

The first line of defence again the background in orbit is an anti-coincidence detector (ACD) which vetoes interactions in the detector from cosmic-rays. At the lower energies, one of the dominant background sources is activation of the instrument from the bombardment of these cosmic rays. An additional challenge in the MeV range is the adverse effects of passive material; interactions in Figure 1 : AMEGO detects gamma rays through both Compton scattering and pair production. At energies less than \u223c10 MeV, a photon will predominantly Compton scatter, and a precise measure of the position and energy of each interaction can constrain the initial photon direction to a circle on the sky. If the direction of the Compton-scattered electron is measured, this circle can be reduced to an arc, which reduces the background contribution. At energies greater than \u223c10 MeV, a gamma ray will undergo pair conversion, and the track of the electron-positron pairs in the instrument determine the initial photon direction. The energy is measured in the calorimeter. passive material render Compton events useless and affect the energy and angular measurements for pair events.

DSSDs are chosen as the Tracker detector element because they provide excellent 3D position resolution, good energy resolution, and have a high technology readiness level (TRL). Surrounding the bottom of the Tracker sits the cadmium zinc telluride (CZT) Low Energy Calorimeter, which has excellent spatial and spectral resolution to measure Compton-scattered photons and low-energy pair showers. This novel subsystem also operates as a standalone Compton detector, not requiring a first interaction in the Tracker, which dramatically increases detection efficiency of AMEGO at the lowest energies. At the bottom of the instrument, the cesium iodide (CsI) High Energy Calorimeter measures the electromagnetic shower from high-energy pair events. Finally, these detector systems are surrounded by a plastic scintillator ACD that rejects the charge-particle background in orbit.

The specific design choices for the Tracker, such as the separation between layers, thickness of the silicon, and the strip pitch, are determined by the instrument requirements. The angular resolution in the pair regime, for example, is driven by the thickness, position resolution, and separation of the DSSDs, while the distance between layers additionally drives the FOV. Furthermore, passive material in the Tracker can be detrimental to accurate Compton and low-energy pair event reconstruction, and therefore must be kept to an absolute minimum.

This high-precision detector needs to be thick (\u223ccm) to provide stopping power for MeV photons, and the coverage of this calorimeter up the sides of the Tracker is a balance between detecting large Compton scatter angles and maintaining a large FOV.

Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) has recently developed thick CZT detectors that achieve excellent spatial and spectral resolution, 14, 15 while operating at room temperature. By using a large geometric ratio detector and placing a grounded electrode near the anode, the virtual Frisch-grid effect shields the anode from the holes. Analogous to a drift chamber, the relative anode and cathode signals give the depth of interaction within the thick detector volume. The novel aspect of the BNL work has been the segmentation of this virtual Frisch-grid electrode into a four sensing electrode; using the relative amplitude of the induced charge on each side pad, the X-Y position of interaction within the detector can be measured. This additional position information can in turn be used to make correction for deformities in the CZT crystal structure and improve upon the energy measurement. Laboratory measurements have shown <1% energy resolution at 662 keV, and a sub-mm position resolution in all 3 dimensions. 16 Compared to pixelated CZT, these virtual Frisch-grid detectors can be made thicker, require fewer electronic channels, and can utilize lower quality detector material. Since these virtual Frish-grid detectors have been developed at BNL for ground-based research, there are a number of design considerations necessary for a space-based Compton-telescope application, such as detector packaging and high-voltage risks. The AMEGO team is currently developing and optimizing these detectors for space applications and this work is discussed further in Sec. 4.2.",

Here, we defined the effective area as the number of valid events qualified by MEGAlib's reconstruction tool, revan, divided by the number of simulated incident events entering the telescope, and scaled by the simulated area surrounding the mass model. The events are separated based on the three classification defined above and there is no further selection on the reconstructed energy or photon origin. Figure 7 (a) shows the simulated effective area for the three event classifications in AMEGO. By combining the detection of Compton and pair events, AMEGO has an effective area that ranges from 500 to 1000 cm 2 across four decades of energy. The untracked Compton events are further separated into two categories. \"Untracked Compton in Silicon\" events require their first interaction to be in the silicon Tracker. If this restriction is not made and we also allow events which interact first in the CZT Low Energy Calorimeter, the effective area increases dramatically. Although the Low Energy Calorimeter cannot track the direction of the scattered electron, with the excellent energy and position resolution of the CZT, these events can still be reconstructed and used for imaging, particularly for sources of narrow-line emission. The effective area is not directly an instrument requirement, but it feeds into the sensitivity, as discussion in Sec. 3.4. ",

The angular resolution for a Compton telescope is described by the FWHM of the 1D point spread function (PSF), also known as the ARM distribution. The ARM, or angular resolution measure, is the smallest angular distance between the nominal source location and the event circle for each event; the distribution of all ARM values from a sample of Compton events gives effective 1D PSF of a Compton telescope. In the pair regime, the angular resolution is defined as the 68% containment radius of the PSF. The pair PSF is given by the angular distance between the nominal and reconstructed photon direction for events for a point source. Measuring the track of a Compton-scattered electron is not expected improve the ARM for an event since the direction of the Compton-scattered electron is so poorly measured. In fact, as shown in Fig. 7 (b) , the angular resolution for tracked events is slightly worse than untracked events for the same energies. This, however, is due to a selection effect: for an event to be tracked at 1 MeV, for example, a significant fraction of energy must be transferred to the Compton-scattered electron, which, by the Compton equation, will result in a large Compton scatter angle. Events with a larger Compton scatter angle inherently have a worse angular resolution due to the propagation of error in the Compton equation. ",

Figure 7 (c) shows the energy resolution for Compton events. An energy resolution of 1% FWHM/E is achieved at 1 MeV. The energy resolution for Untracked Compton events is better than that seen for tracked Compton events for two reasons. First, the Low Energy Calorimeter dominates the Untracked Compton event classification and the CZT has better energy resolution than the DSSDs in the Tracker. Second, the energy resolution for tracked events will often be worse since more interactions are recorded (at least two in the tracker, by definition), and the errors add up for each measurement.",

The The Trigger Module currently has 16 different trigger conditions that account for all possible coincidence outcomes in the four subsystems of the instrument. The ideal trigger condition corresponds to two hits in the Tracker (coincidence between X-Y (top/bottom) strips in a single detector), and one in either calorimeter; however, other trigger conditions are being explored. The Tracker itself has 3 different coincidence models: 1) only one side of one detector has a hit (very susceptible to noise), 2) coincidence between X-Y on a single Tracker layer, and 3) any two Tracker layers have a hit on one side of a detector. The variety of coincidence modes, in addition to a pre-scalings option which can be applied to the different trigger modes, allow for a flexible system which can accommodate noisy and dead strips. The Trigger Module has been tested with mock detector inputs and has been fully integrated with the Low Energy Calorimeter. Tests with the High Energy Calorimeter and Tracker are expected to take place over the next few months. See Ref. 36 for a detailed description of the AMEGO prototype Trigger Module.",
