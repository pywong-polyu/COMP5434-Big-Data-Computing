Scientists rely on competitive grant funding to finance their research; this is an opportunity for researchers to communicate their scientific vision and engage funders, major players in defining how public funds and government policies are prioritized to drive research and innovation. PE is often still seen as a box-ticking or persuasion exercise, yet establishing the right communication channels with the public is pivotal for a scientist's job to impact society. We believe that evidencebased communication is becoming essential in a world dominated by an excess of information, where verified sources are under pressure. Support in the form of dedicated training and allocated resources, particularly for early career researchers, can help establish what we describe as a long-lasting virtuous circle, in which public funds are spent effectively toward scientific advances that the public and policy makers can embrace.",

For commercial entities, this can mean previous funding success, the expected commercial outcomes and impact. Impact can be measured in different ways, with scientific publications being the main output considered, particularly for academic researchers. This can be problematic as bibliometric studies in various fields have shown that the ''top'' journals (those with high number of citations and most prestige) are heavily dominated by research produced in a small number of countries, mostly the United States and the United Kingdom (Mason and Merga, 2021). Furthermore, a report suggested that some of the most relevant international funding schemes are affected by institutional bias, with funding panels more likely to give prestigious European Union early career grants to applicants connected to the institutions of some of the panelists (Kwon, 2021) . In the United Kingdom, funding bodies have a shared policy for research assessment that is informed by the Research Excellence Framework (REF) , which aims to provide accountability for public investment in research, to produce evidence of the benefits to the economy and society, and provides benchmarking information to inform the selective allocation of funding for research (REF, 2021) .",

This will likely entail the establishment of new methods to measure research impact and scientific excellence beyond the sole use of publications and impact factors.

An example in this direction is the MPscientist partnership promoted by the Royal Society since 2001, which helps to create a common language and establish personal trust relationships to promote evidencebased policies. Some researchers also have roles in advising policy makers, for instance, as chief scientific advisers, although once again these tend to exclude early career researchers and efforts should be made to change this pattern.",

This ''infodemics'' is plagued by the rapid and wide spread of false news or unverified information (not only in science), forcing the scientific community to find ways to effectively engage the widest possible audiences. Because it is generally accepted that evidence should guide decisions, evidence communication should increasingly become an integral part of a researcher's career. Key to a successful engagement is trust; scientists need to rely on their expertise, but also require the public to perceive that they are being offered an honest message conveyed with good intentions (Blastand et al., 2020) . Rather than cherrypicking the most persuasive data, it is crucial to provide the full picture, being clear on the uncertainty of the data available and highlighting the unknowns.",

With increasing economic pressure on funding availability and the ongoing infodemic, it is imperative that early career scientists are offered the opportunity and, crucially, the time and resources to develop their science communications skills. For instance, dedicated science communication jobs should be further supported to enable scientists to focus on research and ensure science is communicated effectively across society. This would enable early career researchers to become valuable members not only of the scientific community but also of society as a whole, and make it easier for them to participate in and nurture this virtuous circle.",
