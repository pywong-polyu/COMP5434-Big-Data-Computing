What other enterprise but science can unite so many diverse 32 cultures and nationalities in global uncertainty and discord, and mobilize an effective response 33 against a common enemy. The efforts of science are in stark contrast to those of populism that 34 has introduced division and a self-serving attitude that are not simply ill-matched to tackle the 35 pandemic, but foster its spread and severity.

Criticism is second nature to science and its underlying 66 driving force for discovery and advancing knowledge. The peer review process is a fundamental 67 pillar of the scientific process, so certainly the growth of preprint publications should be viewed 68 with some concern.

            "text": "79SARS-coV-2(Liu et al., 2020). It rapidly spread around the world, causing great distress and 80 death and wreaking havoc on all societies. Ironically, the pandemic has revealed the fallacy and 81 insipid intellectual underpinnings of populism(McKee et al., 2020), as the virus is not deterred 82 by any physical or rhetorical barriers that populist may try to erect, even within the same 83 country. A common enemy has revealed the need to marshal a common response, and no one is 84 J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f scientists of diverse backgrounds and economic resources, from developed and less developed 86 countries, sharing their thoughts and ideas on tackling this staggering challenge. Unlike 87 populism, science is dependent upon a respectful exchange and critical appraisal of ideas. 88We trust that the readers of European Journal of Pharmacology will discover new ideas 89 and concepts in our special COVID-19 series. This collection of both review articles and original 90 research exhibits a broad breadth of coverage. Yet, the contributions share an enthusiasm in a 91 desire to put forward a fresh perspective and make a positive difference by the exchange of 92 ideas. 93There is no miracle drugs or cures for the pandemic, but rather the promise of drugs or 94 cures that are grounded in the guiding principles of solid scientific effort. That is not to discount 95 the importance of individual faith as a motivating force for some in science, or the lack of faith 96 in others. Unlike populism, science respects our differences, while acknowledging our 97 commonality.
