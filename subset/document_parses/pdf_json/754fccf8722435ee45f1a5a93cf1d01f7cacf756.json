For example, the Simulation Use for Global Away Rotations (SUGAR) curriculum uses simulated cases to prepare residents for the emotional challenges of global health rotations. An online training curriculum, Procedural Education for Adaptation to Resource-Limited Settings (PEARLS), was developed soon thereafter to teach trainees how to adapt clinical procedures to resourcelimited settings. According to self-reflections on individual learning, this simulation-based training has demonstrated positive learning outcomes and effectively prepared trainees for situations during clinical experiences abroad [14] . Examples of online global health didactics have also been reported globally [2, 15, 16] , with successful results. In an online multidisciplinary global health course taught in Mexico, students reported gaining empathy for global health inequities and an understanding of complex global health issues [15] . A virtual telesimulation program at Yale School of Medicine, developed during the COVID-19 pandemic, resulted in positive feedback from students and faculty. Furthermore, there were no statistically significant differences in evaluation results between students who completed the virtual program compared to those who completed inperson training [17, 18] . Online courses during both the COVID-19 pandemic and the 2014-15 Ebola epidemic in West Africa were successful in providing standardized education [2, [17] [18] [19] .",

Previous research indicates that online health education has demonstrated no significant difference in student satisfaction compared to in-person learning and even has demonstrated improved performance in student evaluations of knowledge and skills; [3, 20, 21] however, there remain significant gaps in the literature when considering transferring practical clinical skills in global health. A review of online learning methods in health education reported that although e-learning generally facilitates learning through flexibility and adaptability to individual learning styles including in the clinical applications of health education, it may not be a suitable method of learning for disciplines that require practical demonstrations [22] . Although student perceptions of online clinical teaching methods have been comparable to in-person methods, performance has depended on self-directed student engagement with online learning materials [23, 24] . There remain several knowledge gaps relevant to remote global health education: (a) whether clinical global health skills can effectively be taught via an online platform, (b) whether faculty and students would find a remote platform to be an acceptable method of instruction, and (c) whether the advantages of online learning outweigh its disadvantages.",

Course content covers the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in low-and middle-income countries, including, for example, malnutrition, malaria, diarrheal illnesses, perinatal illnesses, tropical diseases, HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and chronic non-communicable diseases. The course also includes discussion of health systems, healthcare delivery, humanitarian assistance, global health ethics, and career development in global health.

The 10 evening sessions of the 2021 course offering are outlined in Table 1 . Platform features such as live polling and virtual breakout rooms were utilized when possible. Meanwhile, participatory skills sessions remained a central component of the course, and thus, hands-on learning required students to find common household items for the simulations ( Table 2 ). For example, in place of the resuscitative equipment and newborn mannequins used for basic newborn resuscitation training in previous years of the course, each student was asked to bring an empty shampoo bottle (or similar) to simulate a self-inflating bag-mask device, hand towels for drying the newborn, and something to roughly approximate a newborn mannequin, such as a relevant-sized doll, stuffed animal, or even a rolled towel.

This institutional survey instrument was a well-established, previously-validated instrument used by the school for all electives and covered, for example, student satisfaction, course strengths, course weaknesses, and faculty professionalism. The remaining two surveys -one for all the course's students and one for all the course's faculty -were our own RED-Cap-based (Nashville, TN, USA) online questionnaires (see Supplemental Digital Appendices 2 and 3 for survey instruments), which were developed in consultation with two external experts in medical education evaluation and included closed-and open-ended questions related to the course and its remote-learning approach, specifically, the effectiveness of each teaching component and of remote teaching as a whole.

The course's highest-ever enrollment was in 2021, with more than twice the students enrolled compared to previous years, including third and fourth-year students who attended during clinical rotations. Some of this growth may be attributable to increased demand because of increased public attention to global health, although this additional attention requires adapting for students otherwise unable to access such courses. A second advantage is that the virtual platform allows students to hear from speakers around the world engaged in various facets of global health work. A major critique of Western academic global health is its failure to integrate global voices [36] . There is clear value to using virtual learning to 'globalize' global health classes, ensuring that content is taught by individuals with personal and professional ties to the communities about which the students are learning. With 100% of students giving them the maximum possible score on preparation and knowledgeability, the guest lecturers were clearly a major highlight of the class.

While virtual delivery had multiple advantages, the transition to an online class was imperfect. The major disadvantages noted by students and faculty were a lack of community, personal interactions, and the difficulty teaching hands-on skills sessions. One student reflected that the course's only weakness was the lack of community, and a lecturer noted that it was 'more difficult to recreate informal discussion. ' Based on these comments, it is possible that students may find a remote course to be a less effective approach to choosing a career direction and finding a mentor. Despite these limitations, students had an overwhelmingly positive impression of the course and its educational value. The Net Promoter Score of this course was excellent at 92, exceeding those of popular high-loyalty consumer brands (Starbucks Coffee 77, Apple iPhone 63, Harvard Business School 41) [37] . This positive impression corroborates previous research that student satisfaction and performance in remote health education courses are comparable to in-person learning [3, 20, 21] . Along with the online course's demonstrated advantages of accessibility and integration of global voices, it may be valuable to incorporate virtual learning methods to clinical global health courses in the future.",

While video-conferencing platforms offer multiple features to add interactivity to the learning experience, most lectures were delivered using only basic videoconferencing, live chat, and screen-sharing capabilities. Communication and community may be enhanced by encouraging the use of more video-conferencing features such as breakout rooms and polls. Other suggestions included pre-scheduling virtual office hours which would allow students a chance to interact in a more conversational setting with both the instructors and one another, as well as asking students to enable their cameras during class time.",

While most faculty felt that remote teaching is less effective compared to in-person teaching, no faculty recommended resuming only in-person learning. A hybrid model could deliver the majority of lectures online, supplementing with in-person skills exercises. This model could address the major noted limitation of the course regarding difficulty in disseminating practical skills virtually, as well as some of the limitations noted by students and faculty regarding lack of community and informal discussions by providing a space for in-person mentorship and career development. This proposed model would also maintain reported positive components of remote learning, including accessibility of lectures and diversity in global speakers, a particular advantage for global health education.",

However, there are several additional theoretical frameworks of learning that may serve to inform future hybrid models of clinical global health education [46] . Future research is also needed to demonstrate the impact of hybrid models in students' performance in clinical evaluations in global health.

The success of Clinical Topics in Global Health suggests that a remote or hybrid model of medical education may be amenable to adaptation for other global health courses. Further research is needed to leverage the strengths while addressing the challenges of remote online global health training. ",
