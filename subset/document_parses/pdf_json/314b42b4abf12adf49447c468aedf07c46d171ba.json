We use SEIJR and SIJR models involving populations of susceptible, exposed, infective, diagnosed, dead and recovered individuals to infer from covid-19 data rate constants, as well as their variations in response to lockdown measures. To account for confinement, we distinguish two susceptible populations at different risk: confined and unconfined. We show that transmission and recovery rates within them vary in response to facts. A key unknown to predict the evolution of the epidemic is the fraction of the population affected by the virus, including asymptomatic subjects. Our study tracks its time evolution with quantified uncertainty from available official data, limited, however, by the data quality. We exemplify the technique with data from Spain, country in which late drastic lockdowns were enforced for months. In late actions and in the absence of other measures, spread is delayed but not stopped unless a large enough fraction of the population is confined until the asymptomatic population is depleted. To some extent, confinement could be replaced by strong distancing through masks in adequate circumstances.",

An increasing number of mathematical studies assess the efficacy of different policies [1, 4, 5, 11, 17, 22] . Moreover, mathematical models and data analysis are employed to estimate relevant epidemiological parameters [13, 22, 24, 28, 29, 34] and to try to forecast the evolution [2, 14, 16, 23, 25, 30, 35] . While some of this research is based on direct data analysis [22, 29] , machine learning techniques [2, 35] or empirical laws for different populations [17] , the use of balance equations to predict population dynamics is a common approach.",

            "text": "After the pioneering work of Kermack and McKendrick [21] , SIR type models have become a standard tool in epidemiological studies [12] . The specific structure of the selected models depends on the available information and on assumptions about the epidemic spread [18] . Basic SIR models involve populations of susceptible S, infected I, and recovered R individuals, expecting immunity of the latter [3, 11, 16, 34] . SEIR variants distinguish also the individuals exposed to the virus E, which may become infective [24, 25] . Immunity of the recovered is suppressed in SEIRS systems [23, 30] . During the 2002-04 SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) outbreak, these models were adapted to describe the SARS epidemic in different countries by singling out the diagnosed infective J [10, 13] , becoming SEIJR or SIJR models. Diagnosed individuals are isolated. The virus SARS-CoV-2 responsible for the illness covid-19 belongs to the same family as the virus SARS-CoV, responsible for SARS. The epidemics triggered by them share some features, such as the role of asymptomatic individuals in superspread events, see [28] for a quantification of the fraction of asymptomatic population during covid-19 spread following this approach. Here, we will study the effect of confinement measures on covid-19 spread by distinguishing two susceptible SEIJR populations: confined and non confined.",

In the case of the current covid-19 pandemic, different countries, and regions within them, define the diagnosed, recovered and dead individuals they count in their official reports in different ways. The number of dead individuals may refer only to patients who die in hospitals or include also deaths at homes and care homes. Furthermore, the death of covid patients with previous health issues may be officially attributed to other causes. On the other hand, the number of diagnosed individuals may refer only to cases confirmed by a PCR (Polymerase chain reaction) test or include also positive antibody tests, or probable cases with compatible symptoms and clinical history. Moreover, the results of tests may arrive with a variable delay, which results in fluctuations and exclusions. Undated cases may not be counted at all. Tests repeated for the same individuals may be counted as different. Additionally, the number of tests performed varies largely over the weeks due to supply shortages and changes in local testing policies, and the accuracy of the tests employed may fluctuate, yielding false negatives or positives.",

Instead of fixing specific guesses for the model coefficients, it is convenient to explore approaches that quantify uncertainty [5, 7, 11, 17, 28] . Unlike most work which does not distinguish undocumented and documented infected individuals, here we follow the SEIJR approach and compare data to model predictions of diagnosed infected J [10, 13, 28] , including quarantine measures for them and taking into account the diagnose rate due to testing. We develop a general framework to infer SEIJR model coefficients from data with quantified uncertainty, taking into account confinement measures as they are sequentially enforced or lifted by means of two populations: confined and unconfined. This allows us to analyze variations in the model rates and in the distributions of the different populations a time grows as a result of the measures implemented, including undiagnosed infected individuals and asymptomatic individuals. We focus on the case of Spain, where drastic late global lockdowns were enforced at the same time in the whole country, producing well differentiated periods in the data along a long time period, see Fig. 1 . The situation is quite different from the german case, in which mild measures were implemented very early to curb the spread [11] , the italian case, where strongth spatiotemporal differences between regions occurred [4, 16] , and from studies of initial stages [24, 25] . Nevertheless, our methods apply to data for diagnosed, dead and recovered individuals from any other country. The key idea is introducing a susceptible subpopulation at lower risk, which might also be achieved by milder measures such as generalized distancing through masks instead of confinement in a closed system, no individuals enter or exit the system. The analysis of migration and spatial dynamics are relevant topics [14, 4, 28] , still out of the scope of the present study.",

We intend to quantify uncertainty when fitting these models to data from the current covid-19 pandemic. We use the SIJR simplification for the initial stage of the outbreak, before contention measures were taken, and compare to the full SEIJR results. SIJR predictions usually underestimate the total number of affected people. Section 3 explains how to obtain guesses of model parameters, which play the role of prior knowledge for the Bayesian studies in Section 4. Section 5 analyzes the initial stage while Section 6 considers the effect of contention measures, with spanish data. We adapt the SEIJR framework to study parameter uncertainty through the different stages, inferring also key magnitudes such as the time evolution of the number of asymptomatic and undiagnosed individuals affected by the virus, or the global number of affected people. In late interventions, and in the absence of other preventive measures, spread is delayed but not stopped unless a large enough fraction of the population is confined for a long enough time, until the number of asymptomatic and undiagnosed individuals is depleted. Once confinement is over, the usage of masks plays a similar role keeping a fraction of the population at a lower risk in a closed system. Section 7 summarizes our conclusions.",

They may progress to the infective state I at a rate k. The class I is composed of symptomatic, infectious, and undiagnosed individuals. Infectious individuals I become diagnosed J at a rate \u03b1. The recovery rate of the infective I is \u03b3 1 , whereas the recovery rate of the diagnosed J is \u03b3 2 . The recovered individuals R keep track of the cumulative number of sick individuals who become healthy again. Diagnosed individuals J are isolated from the rest. Their reduced impact on transmission is represented through a parameter . Mortality of infected I and diagnosed J individuals caused by the virus is denoted by \u03b4. Finally, \u03b2 represents the transmission rate: how susceptible S individuals become virus spreaders. Time is measured in days. The model has to be complemented with initial conditions. This fact introduces an additional parameter t in to locate the time at which local spread started [13] . Other approaches assume the initial data unknown instead [11] , in our case that choice would increase considerably the number of unknowns. Furthermore, we consider that the risk of infection for S 2 is lower than the risk for S 1 by a factor p. The total population is partitioned as S 1 = (1 \u2212 \u03c1)S, S 2 = \u03c1S, \u03c1 being the fraction of the susceptible population S at a lower risk of infection.

Their solutions admit analytic expressions, detailed in Appendix 8. Thanks to that fact, they have been used to analyze the influence of isolation measures on the inflexion point, see [13] and references therein. Notice that sign balances in (3) govern the increase of the number of infected people.

We have superimposed the predictions for \u03bd max and \u03bd mean . Note that \u03bd max does not have a statistical meaning, it keeps track of a possible best fit to the data. On the other hand, \u03bd mean represents some kind of average behavior. When the distributions under study are symmetric, it will be close to \u03bd max . Otherwise, it may depart from it. In our case, slight asymmetry is caused by discarding negative values. In principle, we could try to improve our estimate of the parameter values that maximize the likelihood by optimization procedures [8] .

No parameter t in appears in the next periods, we set it equal to zero. Instead, we introduce \u03c1 \u2208 (0, 1) to quantify the abrupt changes in the fraction of people confined at the start of each period. We assume that the transmission rate for S 2 is lower by a factor p, that is, p\u03b2 instead of \u03b2, due to the reduction of contacts with other people. Due to possible interaction with already sick people or people still working outside at home, we cannot set it equal to zero. We adapt the framework presented in Section 4 ensambling these periods as we explain next. To consider stages i, i = 1, . . . , Q, we multiply the number of parameters by Q. The first block of 9 parameters is the standard one for the first period. The remaining blocks correspond each to one additional period, with t in replaced by \u03c1. We keep the same initial guesses of the parameters used in Section 5 as prior knowledge in all the periods, except for \u03c1, which is set equal to 3/4, 4/5, 15/16 respectively, an approximation of the population switches at the different stages. The deviations are kept equal to 0.1 for all, except t in , for which we set it equal to 10. As for the data, we keep the same deviations as in Section 5 in all the periods, in the absence of better information. Let us consider first the initial confinement period. Figure 5 (a) compares to data the evolution of the diagnosed subpopulations. Population dynamics is calculated solving the SEIJR model in two sequential steps, in [t in , T 1 ] and [T 1 , T 2 ], using in each of them the parameter values obtained for that period and the initial data stipulated earlier. Panel (b) represents the solutions of the SEIRJ model including the contribution of undiagnosed and asymptomatic individuals. Panel (d) compares the distribution of some parameters in the two periods. The transmission rate \u03b2 increases slighty in the second period, while the diagnose rate remains low. These histograms are discretizations of the probability, so that the height of each bin is the number of samples divided by the total and by the basis of the bins (which is the same for the histograms corresponding to the same parameters in this figure and the previous ones to allow for comparisons). Figure 5 (e) quantifies uncertainty in the total number of people affected by the virus after these two periods. If we keep the parameter values \u03bd max or \u03bd mean up to time T 3 > T 2 , growth slows down, but it does not stabilize, see Fig. 5 (c).",

According to the information available on the spanish outbreak, and taking into account that infected people can take up to 14 days to show symptoms, this might be a delayed reflection of crowd gatherings occurred at the end of the first period, or also, a result of the lack of protective equipment for overwhelmed health care and security workers.

This may be a consequence of fixing prior guesses for the model parameters that worsen with time. Note that the predictions that would be obtained using the prior are rather poor, compared to true counts, as time grows. However, the predictions provided by \u03bd max fit the data quite well, even for later times, see Fig. 2(b) . Note that as we add data from new periods, we are including more information in the analysis. The best coefficient values estimated for previous periods change slightly and we infer more moderate numbers of affected individuals, as compared with the previous studies done using less data. However, the same trends persist: increase of \u03b2 in the second period, while \u03b3 1 and \u03b3 2 decrease, decrease of \u03b4 and low diagnose rate \u03b1. Very few tests were done during these periods. In fact, the usefulness of tests would be to increase the diagnose rate, augmenting the number of quarantined infected and asymptomatic individuals. Figure 2 (b) provides a global view of our analysis. Shaded areas represent the total number of diagnosed cases J + D J + R J obtained solving (1) and (10) for the last 1000 sampled parameters in each of the four frameworks we have considered: red for Period 1, green for Periods 1-2, blue for Periods 1-2-3, magenta for Periods 1-2-3-4. Dotted lines represent the mean of the curves obtained for all the samples. Thicker lines represent the total number of diagnosed cases J + D J + R J for \u03bd max (solid), \u03bd mean (dashed) and \u03bd 0 (dash-dotted). Yellow circles represent the data: total counts of diagnosed people (dead, recovered and active). Colored triangles separate the 'inference' from the 'prediction' regions for each of them. At the back of the triangles, we have the inference region, corresponding to the data we use to infer the parameter values and the total number of affected people. At the front of the triangles, we use model solutions to predict the time evolution keeping the conditions of the last period considered in the inference studies. Taking no measures leads to the evolution represented in red. Confining people who are able to work online or do not work in basic activities results in the dynamics marked in green. Extending the confinement to all the population not working in strictly essential activities leads to the forecast painted in blue. Releasing this last fraction of the population results in the evolution represented in magenta. Notice that the solid magenta curve corresponding to \u03bd max agrees very well with the data past day 68 (last day used to calculate it), whereas some magenta samples deviate considerably. This fact is reflected in the dotted averages, which define somehow a confidence region. After day 68 the population was released from confinement by stages, and the use of masks was enforced, lowering the risk for the users. The country remained closed. The different predictions associated to the four inference studies we carried out are not only due to the confinement or the release of population fractions, but to the fact that we allow for variations in the model coefficients in the different periods to adapt them to additional amounts of data. The fact that the transmission coefficient \u03b2 decreases with time due to improved conditions is fundamental.",

As mentioned earlier, the order of magnitude of the population counts in official records changes noticeably when only PCR confirmed cases are taken into account or also probable cases are included. In the spanish outbreak, the number of probable cases may have been five times higher and the number of dead individuals twice as much. Repeating our previous studies scaling the data in that way, we find estimates about 2 million people, consistent with the official conclusions inferred from selected testing campaings.",

We have developed a Bayesian framework to quantify uncertainty in the effects of lockdown measures through the coefficients of SEIJR and SIJR models for human-to-human transmission. A key idea is the introduction of two populations, one of which has a lower risk of infection than the other. Lower risk may be due to confinement, as it happens for the data we consider here, or to preventive measures, such as the use of masks. Therefore, our methodology is not constrained to lockdown measures.",

We show how enforcing measures that deplete the number of undiagnosed and asymptomatic individuals, while reducing the transmission rate, we can stop the spread. We have focused on the data available for Spain, which shows well differentiated data periods according to the measures taken. We see that the model coefficients in each period vary with the circumstances. For instance, transmission rates may augment as a result of increased interaction and lack of protective measures and recovery rates may decrease as a result of scarceness of resources. The diagnose rate is low, resulting in large number of undiagnosed individuals. Performing more PCR tests increases the diagnose rate, allowing to quarantine more infected and asymptomatic individuals.",

Calculations with daily data do not show significative differences in the observed trends in our case. Moreover, we have used official data for PCR confirmed patients only. The effect of adding probable cases, which may have been five times higher, would require further consideration.",

Introducing spatial mobility [4, 28] is an important issue that should be a subject for future work. Moreover, imperfect implementation of contention measures leads to delays, which might be better described by differential-delay models [33] . We have focused on human-to-human transmission here. Coronaviruses originate in animals, such as bats, and arrive to humans through intermediate animal species which act as reservoirs for future waves [9] , subject deserving further studies.",
