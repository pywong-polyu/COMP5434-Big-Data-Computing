We describe a cohort of patients with a constellation of symptoms occurring four weeks after diagnosis causing different degrees of reduced functional capacity.

Moreover, we only obtained this sensitivity with a specific nucleic acid diagnostic kit. Thus, sensitivity limitations of the different RT-PCR kits may explain why viremia was not detected in all patients despite reporting similar symptoms. Most patients received a combination of antiviral treatment, lopinavir/ritonavir and hydroxychloroquine. No decrease in mortality was seen with the administration of lopinavir/ritonavir in a randomized clinical trial of COVID-19 patients [27] ; however, the study included only severe patients and these findings cannot be extrapolated to our context [28, 29] . Recently, two randomized clinical trials have published their results, the RECOV-ERY trial a randomized open clinical trial who did not find any benefit in 28-days mortality rate in hospitalized COVID-19 patients who received lopinavir/ritonavir [30] ; and the MIRACLE trial a double blind randomized clinical trial exploring the combination of lopinavir/ritonavir and interferon Beta-1b in the treatment of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) that demonstrated a lower mortality with this combination, especially if started in the first 7 days of symptoms [31] . A randomized SARS-CoV-2 post-exposure prophylaxis trial with hydroxychloroquine, probably the best scenario for a drug, did not reduce the rate of infections in exposed patients [32] . Currently there is an ongoing clinical trial exploring lopinavir/ritonavir monotherapy in COVID-19 patients as an early treatment in the outpatient setting prior to hospitalization (NCT04372628) [33] .",

Thus, we do not know if the viremia also persists in asymptomatic patients, in which case symptoms may not be related to viremia. Patients received treatment outside a clinical trial setting with the absence of a placebo-controlled group; therefore, improvements seen in treated patients should not be interpreted as related to the treatment. Treatment bias, in favour of patients with the worst functional status, is another relevant limitation, i.e., patients that will probably have better outcomes because self-reported differences between symptoms will be greater. To assess functional outcomes, we applied a functional scale that has not been validated for patients with the characteristics of this cohort. Finally, we detected RNA but were not able to perform cultures to assess viral viability.",

These patients may benefit from antiviral treatment an issue that should be evaluated in randomized placebo-controlled trials. ",
