Excess weight is associated with an increased risk of hospitalisation, admission to intensive care and death from COVID-19 [16, 17] . This has led to interest in the potential for interventions to treat obesity to reduce the risk of adverse COVID-outcomes. In the UK, the National Institute for Clinical Excellence recently consulted on the addition of two new Quality and Outcomes Framework indicators, to be applied from 2021 [18] . These would financially incentivise referral from primary care of eligible adult patients to a weight management programme, resulting in a likely increase in number of patients accessing these services. Clarifying the effect that this may have on symptoms of depression and anxiety is of high importance if weight loss programmes are to be offered at scale.",

A recent comprehensive systematic review highlighted larger transparent data sets, regular reporting, comparison with an appropriate inactive comparator group and longer follow up as a priority areas for future RCTs [20] . This data set offers unique insights into the longer term effects of group based weight loss programmes on symptoms of anxiety and depression due to the 24 month follow up. Measurements were taken at baseline, 3, 12 and 24 months, so changes in anxiety and depression scores were monitored over time. Participants were randomised to either a brief intervention encouraging a self-help approach (a realistic inactive comparator group), or a programme provided by a commercial weight loss provider over 12 or 52 weeks, so that confounding from other variables such as adverse life events and co-morbidities was mitigated. The aim was to examine the impact of group-based weight loss programmes on mental health, specifically symptoms of anxiety and depression, compared to self-directed weight loss attempts. The main analysis will explore the average impact on the population studied. However, there may be individual differences in who benefits and who experiences harm. Baseline levels of anxiety or depression is one such factor and subsequent analysis will investigate whether any effect is greater amongst those with higher depression or anxiety scores at baseline.",

The participants were selected through electronic patient records at 23 primary care practices across England between 18 th October 2012 and 10 th February 2014. Exclusion criteria included previous or planned bariatric surgery; planned (within 2 years) or current pregnancy; participation in a concurrent structured weight loss programme; eating disorders; non-English speakers or special communication needs; individuals with terminal illness or receiving palliative care; severe mental health problem, learning difficulty or dementia; a carer for a terminally ill individual or recently bereaved. The randomisation sequence was generated by the trial statistician at the time of protocol development and unknown to research staff and trial participants. Once participants were enrolled, the database revealed group allocation. Due to the nature of the intervention in the trial (attendance at a structured weight loss programme), participants and researchers could not be blinded to the intervention. Participants were followed up for a total of 24 months, completing the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) at 0, 3, 12 and 24 months. The primary outcome was difference in mean weight change from baseline to 12 months between the three groups and this has been published elsewhere [22] . In line with previous analyses, an intention to treat analysis was conducted, in that all participants were included, regardless of their attendance at follow up or completion of questionnaires. The trial (number ISRCTN82857232) was registered with Current Controlled Trials and ethical approval was gained centrally at from NRES Committee East of England East and locally from NRES Committee South Central Oxford and NRES Committee North West Liverpool Central.",

There was no evidence that allocation to group support rather than self-guided weight loss influenced symptoms of anxiety. The mean scores for all groups did not vary much over time, including at 24 months when weight regain had taken place. There was no evidence that the effects of weight loss treatment depended on the degree of depression or anxiety symptoms present at baseline. A strength of this trial was the generalisability to the UK population. Participants were recruited from multiple centres (Oxford, Cambridge and Liverpool) with over half of the participating GP practices from areas with an index of multiple deprivation score above the UK average [19] .

Randomisation should distribute covariates equally between groups at baseline, however we cannot exclude post-randomisation bias, such as unequal distribution of pharmacotherapy or psychotherapy between groups after this. Another limitation was that only adults with a BMI \ufffd 28 kg/m 2 were included. Adults with a BMI between 25-28 kg/m 2 also have negative health consequences associated with excess weight [26] .
