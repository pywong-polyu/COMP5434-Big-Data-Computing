            "text": "Therapeutic interventions targeting viral infections remain a significant challenge for both the medical and scientific communities. While specific antiviral agents have shown success as therapeutics, viral resistance inevitably develops, making many of these approaches ineffective. This inescapable obstacle warrants alternative approaches, such as the targeting of host cellular factors. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), the major respiratory pathogen of infants and children worldwide, causes respiratory tract infection ranging from mild upper respiratory tract symptoms to severe lifethreatening lower respiratory tract disease. Despite the fact that the molecular biology of the virus, which was originally discovered in 1956, is well described, there is no vaccine or effective antiviral treatment against RSV infection. Here, we demonstrate that targeting host factors, specifically, mTOR signaling, reduces RSV protein production and generation of infectious progeny virus. Further, we show that this approach can be generalizable as inhibition of mTOR kinases reduces coronavirus gene expression, mRNA transcription and protein production. Overall, defining virus replicationdependent host functions may be an effective means to combat viral infections, particularly in the absence of antiviral drugs.",

Globally, RSV accounts for ~ 200,000 deaths per year in children less than 5 years old, making RSV the 3rd most common cause of death secondary to pneumonia in this age group (after Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae) 2 . The clinical manifestations of RSV infection in young children range from mild upper respiratory tract symptoms to severe life-threatening lower respiratory tract disease. The epidemiology of RSV is complex and dynamic. RSV strains can be classified, based on serological and genetic methods, into 1 of 2 subgroups (A or B) and both subgroup A and B viruses circulate during each seasonal epidemic 3,4 . Strains in a community vary from year to year and strains identified in one location may be similar to or quite distinct from strains identified in different years in vastly different geographic locations.",

The treatment of the RSV infected child is essentially supportive care (supplemental oxygen, hydration, invasive or non-invasive respiratory support, if necessary). A humanized monoclonal antibody (palivizumab) was approved by the FDA in 1998 to protect high risk infants against severe RSV disease as a prophylactic agent, however this product is not approved for use in the vast majority of otherwise healthy infants and does not protect against RSV infection.

Among the subgroup A and B strains selected for this study, there was a varying degree of viral protein synthesis during the viral replication cycle (Supplementary Fig. 1A -C). From these, we arbitrarily selected NH409A, a subgroup A strain, to evaluate whether mTORC1 has any significant role in RSV protein synthesis or generation of infectious particles. A549 cells were infected with RSV strain NH409A for 1.5 hours 20, 22 . Infected A549 cells were then treated at varying doses with rapamycin (sirolimus), an mTORC1-specific inhibitor 28-30 for 22.5 h. Western blotting and plaque titration assays were performed at 24 h post-infection. We chose this time point as our previous studies have shown that the induction of the cellular innate immune response occurs within this time frame in RSV-infected cells 21 . At low dose (0.1 nM), rapamycin completely inhibited S6K1 phosphorylation, a read-out for mTORC1 activity and this correlated with the activation (phosphorylation) of Akt, a well-known downstream target for mTORC2 ( Fig. 1A -C). Consistent with the reduced level of S6K1 phosphorylation, rapamycin treatment predictably decreased phosphorylation of ribosomal protein S6 (upper band, Fig. 1A , D). Inhibition of mTORC1 by rapamycin resulted a statistically significant induction of viral nucleocapsid N and fusion F1 proteins (Fig. 1E,F) . Functionally, elevated viral protein levels also correlated with statistically significant increase in the production of virus progeny (Fig. 1G) . Further, induction of viral proteins and the generation of progeny virus was observed at high doses of rapamycin (10-100 nM) (Supplementary Fig. 2A-E) , though the maximal effect appears to be in the range of 1-10 nM. These observations were replicated with NH1101A, a subgroup A3 RSV isolate ( Supplementary Fig. 3A-D) , and NH1125B, a B subgroup RSV isolate ( Supplementary Fig. 4A -I) indicating that the effect of rapamycin is generalizable across RSV strains. These initial observations warranted further mechanistic studies of how inhibition of mTORC1 signaling induced RSV protein synthesis and generation of progeny virus.",

            "text": "The inhibition of mTORC1 with rapamycin correlated with the predictable activation (phosphorylation) of Akt (Fig. 1A,B) , due to the loss of negative feedback loops 31, 32 . Akt, an upstream activator of mTORC1, is known to promote cell survival, proliferation, and growth 19, 33, 34 . Activation of Akt is also known to be involved in many cancers 35 . Our data suggested that the increased activation of Akt correlated with the induction of viral protein synthesis and viral generation of infectious virus. To determine whether Akt has any impact on RSV protein synthesis and production of infectious particles, infected A549 cells were treated with MK-2206, a known pan-Akt inhibitor 36 . Treatment with MK-2206 abolished Akt phosphorylation at 1 \u00b5M, which correlated with reduction of S6K1 activation, and total S6 ( Fig. 2A-D) . Inactivation of Akt correlated with modest enhancement of viral protein synthesis and the production of virus progeny (Fig. 2E-G) , consistent with the findings following rapamycin treatment (Fig. 1) . Our observations suggested a potential similar impact of other class of Akt inhibitors on the generation of infectious RSV progeny virus. 19 . Due to lack of proven mTORC2-specific inhibitors, we used a genetic approach to define the role of mTORC2 in RSV protein synthesis and the generation of infectious progeny virus. Raptor or Rictor was genetically knocked down by stable lenti-viral short-hairpin RNA (shRNA) (Fig. 3A & Supplementary Fig. 5 ) 37 . The knockdown of Raptor significantly reduced S6K1 phosphorylation, while elevating Akt phosphorylation (Fig. 3B-E) , which is consistent with rapamycin treatment (Fig. 1) . In similar fashion, the knockdown of Rictor significantly reduced Akt phosphorylation, while elevating S6K1 phosphorylation. Knockdown of either Raptor or Rictor correlated with increased viral protein synthesis (Fig. 3F ,G). These observations suggest mTORC1 and mTORC2 have a redundant role for RSV replication as far as the generation of infectious virus.",

Here, our data demonstrated that limiting either mTORC1 or mTORC2 signaling enhanced viral protein production and the generation of infectious progeny virus, while inhibiting both complexes impeded RSV protein synthesis, thereby establishing the requirement of mTOR signaling for productive RSV infection. Additionally, our studies highlighted the challenge of RSV infection in patients receiving chemotherapy or immunosuppressive agents (e.g. transplant recipients) such as mTOR inhibitors as we have shown that these commonly used chemotherapeutic agents enhance RSV protein expression and the generation of infectious progeny virus in cell culture. Our observations are consistent with a previous study that showed that rapamycin increased RSV RNA in infected dendritic cells 44 , demonstrating that this phenomenon occurs in primary cells and supports the notion that the use of standard cell lines, as used in our studies, can result in insights into pathogenesis. Moreover, a recent study showed that inhibition of mTORC1 by rapamycin enhanced autophagy and was associated with an increase of RSV replication in HEp-2 cells 45 , supporting our findings. Rapamycin binds FKBP12 protein to form an mTORC1-specific inhibitor [28] [29] [30] . Rapamycin-FKBP12 complexes do not bind or inhibit mTORC2; however, prolonged rapamycin treatment does abrogate mTORC2 signaling, likely due to the inability of rapamycin-bound mTOR to incorporate into new mTORC2 complexes 46, 47 . Consistent with this notion, high concentration of rapamycin treatment diminished or attenuated Akt phosphorylation ( Supplementary Fig. 2 ). Our data also showed significant induction of viral proteins and the production of infectious progeny virus at high doses of rapamycin (10-100 nM), which is equivalent to 9.14-91.4 ng/ml. The target blood concentration of sirolimus, the FDA approved version of rapamycin, is 10-24 ng/ml [48] [49] [50] ; therefore, individuals treated with sirolimus for immunosuppression (e.g. solid organ transplant recipients) or other indications may be at significant risk if they were to contract RSV infection.",

Unfortunately, there are no validated drugs available to inhibit mTORC2 specifically. It is well known that mTORC2 is upstream of mTORC1, and mTORC1 negatively regulates autophagy 19 . By inhibiting both complexes at once via genetic knockdown of mTOR, one would expect to enhance autophagy 51 . If that were the case, then viral protein expression or production of progeny virus should be increased. In contrast to our expectation, inhibiting both complexes with genetic knockdown of both Rictor and Raptor (Fig. 4) or mTOR (Fig. 5) , confirmed by mTOR inhibitor AZD-8055 (Fig. 6 ) decreased the generation of progeny virus. These observations are also in line with literature that autophagy is well known for its ability to limit replication of intracellular pathogens 52 .",

In line with those observations, genetic knockdown of Raptor (mTORC1) increased Akt phosphorylation (Fig. 3 & Supplementary Fig. 5) . Although mTORC1 is known to be a downstream target of mTORC2 (Fig. 7G) , one would expected that inhibition of mTORC2 function would diminish mTORC1 (S6K1 phosphorylation) signaling. However, knockdown of Rictor (mTORC2) resulted in the increase of S6K1 phosphorylation. Previous studies have shown that mTORC2 appears to be necessary for Akt activity toward some but not all substrates 37,53-56 , suggesting the hyper-activation of S6K1 is possibly due to an unknown feedback mechanism. Knockdown of either Raptor or Rictor resulted in www.nature.com/scientificreports/ increased viral proteins, suggesting the mTOR complexes are redundant for RSV replication. To our knowledge, this is the first study to report this observation. The first mTORC2 substrate identified was PKC\u03b1 57,58 . Recently, more mTORC2 targets were identified, including PKC\u03b4, PKC\u03b6, PKC\u03b3, and PKC\u03b5 59-61 . More importantly, mTORC2 is well known for phosphorylation and activation of Akt 37 . Akt is known to promote cell survival, proliferation, and growth, and is involved in many cancers 19, 35 . Treatment with pan-Akt inhibitor MK-2206 modestly enhanced the generation of progeny virus (Fig. 2) . Inhibition of Akt resulted slightly decreased of S6K1 phosphorylation (less active mTORC1), which possibly induced activation of mTORC2 via the loss of negative feedback loops. Our observations with MK-2206 have implications for other classes of Akt inhibitors, specifically for those individuals receiving related compounds for chemotherapy or immunosuppression who may also encounter RSV.",

Effective prevention of COVID-19 requires multifaceted efforts, including vaccinations and antiviral drugs. As of this writing, there are at least 6 vaccines that are in use worldwide. These vaccines target the spike glycoprotein as neutralizing antibodies against this viral protein can prevent infection. However, it is www.nature.com/scientificreports/ now clear that mutations in the spike protein have emerged that alter its antigenic structure, potentially limiting the specificity of the vaccine-induced immunity 62, 63 . Further, there is concern that the new variants identified in the United Kingdom, South Africa, Brazil, and elsewhere have acquired the necessary mutations to make the vaccine-induced neutralizing antibodies less effective 64 . There are a number of studies that sought to determine whether any preexisting antiviral drugs have sufficient effectiveness for treating COVID-19 patients 65,66 . On May 1, 2020, remdesivir, adenosine nucleotide triphosphate analog, was authorized by U. S. Food and Drug Administration for compassionate use in the United States 67 . Due to the fact that SARS-CoV-2 is prone to mutation, one foreseeable obstacle for antiviral therapy is the development of viral resistance, as viral genomic mutations occur during viral replication 17, 18 . Indeed, mutations in the RNA replicase of mouse hepatitis virus, a coronavirus, caused partial resistance to remdesivir 68 . Therefore, alternative therapeutic approaches should be considered. Once inside the host, coronaviruses utilize the host machinery for their replication. Here, we show that targeting mTOR kinase with various small molecule inhibitors is a means to inhibit or diminish viral protein synthesis or replication as we have learned from our RSV experiments. In parallel to our findings with RSV, treatment with mTOR inhibitors abolished or diminished HCoV OC43 spike protein synthesis and the generation of infectious progeny virus, providing a proof-of-concept for alternative therapeutics.",

When the log-transformed data pass the normality test, (1) two-sample t-test was used to test difference in mean between two groups; (2a) standard one-way ANOVA was www.nature.com/scientificreports/ performed to test difference in mean among 3 or more groups if data also pass equal variance test; (2b) Welch's one-way ANOVA was used to test difference in mean among 3 or more groups if data do not pass equal variance test. Dunnett method was used to adjust p value for multiple comparisons between test groups and control group (Vehicle or Scrmble). The adjusted p values were reported for multiple comparisons. The data were displayed in original scale (without transformation) in figures. Biological data for \"No infection\" were presented in the figures, but they were not included for statistical tests. All statistical analyses were performed by Graphpad Prism 9.2.0 software. The significance levels were designated as * for p < 0.05, ** for p < 0.01, *** for p < 0.001, **** for p < 0.0001 and n.s. for nonsignificant (p > 0.05).",

Simple illustration is adopted from a previous review19 . The left portion of the figure delineates the known pathways and interactions between mTORC1 and mTOTC2. (A) Rapamycin (Rapa), a mTORC1-specific inhibitor, increases RSV viral protein synthesis and production of viral progenies. Specific inhibition of mTORC1 by Rapamycin deactivates (de-phosphorylation) of S6K1 and S6 (as denoted by the downward blue arrows). This results in negative feed-back activation (phosphorylation) of mTORC2 (red arrow) and an increase in the phosphorylation of Akt (denoted by the upward green arrow). Data supporting this model is presented inFig. 1. (B)Akt inhibitor MK-2206 increases RSV viral proteins and progenies. Inhibition of Akt phosphorylation activates TSC1/2 (red arrow), which deactivates mTORC1 signaling (blue arrows). This decrease of mTORC1 signaling presumably activated mTORC2 (red arrow) in line with the observed activity of rapamycin. Data supporting this model is presented inFig. 2.(C) mTOR inhibitors block essential functions of HCoV OC43 and RSV replication. Inhibition of both mTORC1 and mTORC2 results in decreased phosphorylation of Akt, S6K1 and S6 (blue arrows) ultimately leading to a reduction of protein synthesis and production of progeny virus of RSV (AZD-8055, seeFig. 6) and reduction of viral gene transcription and protein synthesis of human coronavirus OC43 (AZD-8055 and Torin-1, seeFig. 7). Key: \u22a2 = inhibition (de-phosphorylation), \u25ba = activation (phosphorylation).Scientific Reports | (2021) 11:24442 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-03814-7",

Further, the number of passages of virus in cell culture was limited to prevent the potential viral adaption to cell culture. For all experiments, a m.o.i of 0.2 was used unless otherwise stated. All specimens from which virus were obtained were submitted as part of routine care. Only left-over material was used for viral propagation. Collection of specimens from the Clinical Virology Laboratory at Yale-New Haven Hospital was approved by the Yale University Human Investigations Committee. The RSV isolates from Dallas, Texas were propagated from a de-identified clinical specimen obtained from the Clinical Microbiology Laboratory at Children's Medical Center, Dallas. Collection and use of clinical isolates followed all institutional requirements and guidelines and was consistent with policies and regulations for the use of patient derived materials. Human coronavirus (HCoV) OC43 (ATCC VR-1558), and human HCT-8 colon cells (ATCC CCL-244) were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA).A549 (CCL-185) cells were obtained from ATCC and cultivated in F-12 Kaighn's modification media with 10% fetal bovine serum. Viral titers were determined using a plaque assay 20 . Plaques were detected with an immunohistochemical staining technique with a primary anti-RSV Fusion protein antibody (palivizumab, Med-Immune, Gaithersberg, MD) and a secondary HRP conjugated anti-human antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc., West grove, PA). HCoV OC43 viral titer was determined with HCT-8 cells by median tissue culture infectious dose (TCID 50 ), according to ATCC protocol and briefly described elsewhere69 .
