The most common autoantigen is the acetylcholine receptor; other autoantigens involved in NMJ formation and maintenance (e.g., MuSK [muscle-specific kinase] and LRP4 [low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 4]) have been identified in a subset of patients (1) . In the United States (US), prevalence is estimated at 14-20 per 100,000 population with \u223c60,000 patients currently living with MG, though figures are likely higher since MG is often underdiagnosed (2) (3) (4) . While MG presents with ocular symptoms in approximately two-thirds of patients, symptoms remain isolated to the ocular area in only 15% of cases (referred to as ocular MG or oMG) (1) . For the remaining majority of patients, the disease progresses to generalized MG (gMG), which may involve bulbar, limb, trunk, and respiratory muscles (5) . Exacerbation of gMG symptoms can lead to a myasthenic crisis defined as respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation, which occurs at least once in 15% to 20% of patients with MG during their lifetime (6) .",

However, limited US-based evidence was available for cost burden (10) , and available studies were outdated for providing reliable cost estimates-particularly, the cost burden of gMG has not been clearly delineated from that of oMG (11). With the objective of filling essential knowledge gaps, we evaluated HCRU and costs associated with gMG (including myasthenic crisis management) by designing a novel analysis method validated by gMG experts based on data extracted from a comprehensive US claims database. As a secondary objective, we evaluated treatment patterns associated with subgroups of patients with gMG.",

Although gMG has been associated with a substantial clinical and economic burden, few studies have highlighted the magnitude of this burden in the US (11, 17-23) despite having the highest direct medical cost of MG out of 8 countries with available data (10) . A need for additional and updated studies-particularly focusing on patients' clinical characteristics-was reported in a recent systematic literature review (10) . To address these knowledge gaps, in addition to evaluating HCRU, treatment patterns, and costs in patients with gMG who were ND, PD, and who experienced exacerbation events, we expanded our analysis for patients who experienced myasthenic crisis events to include 3 years leading up to the crisis event, during the crisis event, and 1 year following the crisis event.",

Other past analyses using claims data from Symphony Health's IDV R dataset may aid in further contextualizing our findings in gMG. Mean 1-year per-patient all-cause costs from IDV R in 10,140 patients with epilepsy without tuberculosis sclerosis complex was reported to be $56,397 (24), while total cost over 5 years was reported at $47,464 (average of $9492.80 per year) for 15,599 patients with rheumatoid arthritis who used oral methotrexate only (25) . For 7043 patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, 1year all-cause costs from IDV R were reported at $19,690.40 (26) . Though direct comparisons cannot be made due to non-trivial differences in cost estimation algorithms (i.e., charged vs. paid amounts), it is apparent that costs for gMG lie in the higher range within these relatively age-matched chronic conditions, with exacerbations and crisis events causing costs to rise even further. Of note, previous reporting that the cost of MG management comprised 78% of total direct medical costs when compared with a matched non-MG control group suggests that the majority of healthcare expenses observed in our study can be attributed to gMG management (17) . During interviews, clinical experts estimated the prevalence of gMG to be higher than that found in the literature and claimed that almost all patients require therapy at some point. They predicted that differential diagnoses, diagnostic delays, and the complexity of treatment decisions for ND gMG might lead to increased intervention and thus, increased healthcare costs when compared with PD gMG. Consistent with this, our results demonstrated higher 12-month HCRU ( Table 2 ) and costs ( Table 6 ) associated with ND gMG compared with PD gMG. Increased HCRU was impacted by greater mean hospitalizations, longer LOS, and greater mean ED visits, and increased costs were largely attributed to medical and pharmacy service costs. The pronounced proportion of ND patients with high HCRU associated with the time of new diagnosis suggests that previously undiagnosed patients may present with more severe symptoms or complications that require more intense clinical attention compared with PD patients.",

During the 36-25 months and 24-13 months preceding the crisis index date, HCRU and costs incurred were comparable to, or even lower than, corresponding results for ND and PD patient cohorts. However, a dramatic increase in HCRU and costs was observed during the year immediately preceding the crisis event, which further increased during the year following the crisis index date (which included crisis duration). Increased usage of rescue treatments including IVIg or SCIg, PLEX, eculizumab, and rituximab during these time periods contributed most to the increased costs ( Table 9 ). These data suggest that myasthenic crisis events, which are key drivers of HCRU and cost for patients living with gMG, may be predictable and preventable; additional investigation around possible windows of opportunity and appropriate interventions are warranted.",

Using solely ICD diagnostic codes as a proxy for gMG exacerbations can involve considerable caveats, as misuse or misclassification of diagnostic codes can occur; ICD codes for MG with or without acute exacerbation may be used interchangeably by mistake, and their usage may not totally reflect MG status. This is an inherent limitation associated with analysis of any administrative health claims data without a link to extensive medical records. Additionally, the occurrence of exacerbations can be subjective depending on the individual patient's history, rate of disease progression, and bulbar involvement, and etiologies associated with exacerbation claims were not available in the data. Considering these factors, it should be noted that this subgroup may not capture those with true exacerbations to the full extent. Nevertheless, we found that this subgroup, which included a considerable proportion of patients, had higher HCRU and costs compared with the ND and PD patient cohorts. Despite the limitations, higher usage of laterline treatments (e.g., IVIg, SCIg, and PLEX) suggests this distinct subgroup of patients had a clearly more severe disease profile requiring greater clinical intervention compared with the overall population of patients with gMG.",

Though the number of late-onset MG diagnoses are rapidly increasing (18, 27, 28) , this alone cannot account for the gap. We confirmed that while our initial cohort had a mean age more aligned to a previous insurance database study (11), the mean age increased as each of the following study inclusion criteria were applied: (1) having at least 2 MG claims at least 30 days apart, (2) adults aged \u226518 years, (3) index date between 2017 and 2018, and (4) continuous quarterly claims activity. While we recognize that these criteria led to the enrichment of older patients who may seek increased medical care while excluding a proportion of younger and healthier patients, they were critical to ensure a robust analysis and to maintain consistency with standard practice for longitudinal analyses of open claims data. Next, the present study could not account for key socioeconomic and demographic factors unavailable in the dataset (including race and ethnicity) that are additional underlying drivers of resource use and costs. Critical factors pertaining to disease severity, including MG activities of daily living (MG-ADL), the Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of America (MGFA) class, and MGFA post-intervention status (PIS) are also not available in claims data and must be investigated through other databases. However, some additional patient subgroup stratifications that are feasible using available data in claims (including age, gender, key comorbidities, and geographic location) are currently being analyzed in a separate ongoing follow-up study to address further knowledge gaps pertaining to the burden of gMG in various patient subpopulations.",

Any change in the patients' point-of-care location or benefits enrollment during a quarter with claims activity, as well as any services provided outside of the Symphony Health (Blue Bell, PA, USA) provider network, may have led to missed events. Next, though our analysis took multiple measures to exclude patients with oMG with added considerations for disease progression from oMG to gMG, separate diagnostic codes between oMG and gMG are necessary to establish further targeted insights. Additionally, the IDV R dataset was provider-based (rather than insurance-based) with records unavailable for patient eligibility. Medical expenditures were reported as charged amounts, which are different from actual paid amounts. To address these limitations in the dataset, expert guidance was incorporated into our unique cost estimation algorithms elaborated in Supplementary Methods. Lastly, our definition for direct costs for gMG treatments did not capture costs associated with HCRU, other medical services, or the management of comorbidities. Further comparison of patients with gMG against a claims-based non-gMG population will lend insights into the incremental costs and HCRU of gMG management relative to a general population.",

Additional research is required to better understand the potential drivers of increased HCRU and costs of exacerbation and crisis events by delineating socioeconomic factors and intensity of interventions. Furthermore, real-world reimbursement data should be utilized to validate our novel algorithm. To lower costs and improve outcomes for patients with gMG, providers can monitor and identify risk factors for crisis events to achieve prevention or timely intervention. Importantly, there is a need to reduce IVIg and SCIg costs which account for a major portion of cost to payers, and preventive treatment options that could minimize the risk of crisis events should be made available to relieve the cost burden of patients with gMG in the US.",
