Objectives To estimate the incidence, origins and avoidable harm of diagnostic errors in English general practice. Diagnostic errors were defined as missed opportunities to make a correct or timely diagnosis based on the evidence available (missed diagnostic opportunities, MDOs). Method Retrospective medical record reviews identified MDOs in 21 general practices. In each practice, two trained general practitioner reviewers independently conducted case note reviews on 100 randomly selected adult consultations performed during 2013-2014. Consultations where either reviewer identified an MDO were jointly reviewed. Results Across 2057 unique consultations, reviewers agreed that an MDO was possible, likely or certain in 89 cases or 4.3% (95% CI 3.6% to 5.2%) of reviewed consultations. Inter-reviewer agreement was higher than most comparable studies (Fleiss' kappa=0.63). Sixty-four MDOs (72%) had two or more contributing process breakdowns. Breakdowns involved problems in the patientpractitioner encounter such as history taking, examination or ordering tests (main or secondary factor in 61 (68%) cases), performance and interpretation of diagnostic tests (31; 35%) and follow-up and tracking of diagnostic information (43; 48%). 37% of MDOs were rated as resulting in moderate to severe avoidable patient harm. Conclusions Although MDOs occurred in fewer than 5% of the investigated consultations, the high numbers of primary care contacts nationally suggest that several million patients are potentially at risk of avoidable harm from MDOs each year. Causes of MDOs were frequently multifactorial, suggesting the need for development and evaluation of multipronged interventions, along with policy changes to support them.",

Primary care underpins the UK health system, with an estimated 340 million patient consultations in England annually (or approximately 85% of all National Health Service doctor-patient encounters). 2 Diagnostic errors account for the greatest proportion of malpractice claims against family practitioners (general practitioners, GPs) in the UK (63%) incurring multiple costs. 3 The WHO 4 and the National Academy of Medicine 5 have identified measuring and reducing diagnostic error as a patient safety priority. 4 Judging the magnitude of diagnostic errors requires accurate and reliable estimation. The scale and cause(s) of such errors will vary across countries and contexts. Diagnostic error is estimated to involve 5% of US adults in the outpatient setting or approximately 12 million adults annually. 6 A recent study produced the first estimate for the incidence of 'avoidable significant harm' in UK primary care at 35.6 per 100 000 patient-years. 7 However, that rate includes all causes of avoidable harm, with diagnostic error accounting for around 60%. Using an established definition of diagnostic error, defined as missed opportunities to make a correct or timely diagnosis based on the evidence available, the current study Original research estimates the incidence, origins and avoidable harms of 'missed diagnostic opportunities' (MDOs) in UK primary care.",

In this study, we used this approach to identify 'missed diagnostic opportunities' and excluded clinical situations with no evidence for an opportunity to intervene (see online supplemental figure S1). 9 10 The aetiology of MDOs is multifactorial arising via a complex interplay of contributory factors. 11 To characterise origins and potential contributory factors, we used the 'Safer Dx' conceptual framework which accounts for breakdowns in the processes of care related to diagnosis. 12 This framework involves five interactive process dimensions that could be involved in the breakdown: (1) the patient-provider encounter (history, physical examination, ordering tests/referrals based on assessment); (2) performance and interpretation of diagnostic tests; (3) follow-up and tracking of diagnostic information over time; (4) subspecialty and referral-specific factors; and (5) patient-related factors. Multiple dimensions may be involved in any particular MDO and the framework is designed to address both cognitive and system-related factors.",

But error rates based on single-reviewer assessments may be of insufficient validity and the use of at least two independent reviewers is recommended. 15 Even with two reviewers, reported rates of interreviewer reliability have often been low. [16] [17] [18] In this study, all included index consultations and related case notes in the electronic health records (EHRs) were first assessed by two reviewers acting independently. In addition to providing data for calculating inter-reviewer agreement and confirmation of identified MDOs, this also reduced the risk of any MDOs being missed. Next, all consultations that one or both reviewers regarded as involving an MDO were reassessed by the two reviewers working together. Rather than obligate reviewers to arrive at a consensus, we allowed them the option to continue to disagree.",

However, due to recruitment delays and resource constraints we decided to conduct only phase 1.

Where such activity was detected a full review was conducted, otherwise the review was halted and the reviewer moved on to the next randomly selected patient. For each review, all relevant extracted information, decisions made and supporting free text notes were entered into an electronic case report form (CRF). Under a full review, the content of the case notes was assessed for a time window of at least 3 months prior to the index consultation to a minimum of 9 afterwards, to allow the patient's diagnostic journey to be traced. Based on previous experience, this time frame was expected to capture all the main relevant evidence and allow large numbers of reviews to be completed within the study period. 18 However, to clarify some MDOs and their impact, reviewers could extend the time frame if deemed necessary. The data collection instrument guided the reviewer through the record in a systematic and structured manner, to form a professional judgement on the accuracy of each new diagnosis. The process was informed by two related tasks: (1) searching for the presence, frequency and reason(s) for six predefined 'prompts' potentially indicative of MDOs (ie, consultations, referrals, hospital admissions, out of hours contacts, accident and emergency attendance, imaging requests); and (2) consideration of evidence in response to a set of eight questions adapted from an earlier version of the Safer Dx instrument, 21 a tool for evaluating primary care record reviews for MDOs, which was under development at that time in the USA (see online supplemental box S1). At the end of this process the reviewer coded each new diagnosis into one of six categories (see online supplemental box S2 and online supplemental table S2): (1) diagnosis accurate and sufficient evidence to make a confident determination of accuracy; (2) diagnosis accurate but insufficient evidence to make a confident determination; (3) diagnosis accurate but incomplete and/or little or no evidence; (4) MDO possible (professional interpretation but little or no documented evidence); (5) MDO likely (at least some documented evidence); and (6) MDO certain (compelling documented evidence). To help understand the origins of each MDO, reviewers were asked to determine the corresponding breakdown process(es) involved. A corresponding rating of the harm attributable to each MDO was obtained using a 5-point scale, adapted from previously published work 22 on the impact of adverse effects in family practice: 'no harm', 'mild harm', 'moderate harm', 'severe harm' and 'unclear'. Reviewers assessed the actual harm as evidenced in the case notes and were guided by the definitions and examples provided in the study manual (online supplemental box S3). For example, mild harms included minor or inconvenient impacts without any residual effect, such as unnecessary appointments; moderate harms were those that caused prolonged distress or impact, for example, prolonged distress resulting in unnecessary sick leave; severe harms involved consequences with prolonged or permanent impact, for example, preventable hospital admission/procedures/ complications, disease progression, disability or death. MDOs where the reviewer was unable to make a determination were given an 'unclear' rating.",

Our sampling frame purposely excluded patients with less than 9 months of follow-up, allowing sufficient time for harmful consequences to emerge and be identified, but as a result MDOs of moderate/severe harm leading to early practice transfer-out or death may be under-represented. While retrospective methods are susceptible to hindsight/observer bias in judgements about error determination, 35 they provide opportunities to review longitudinal data that reflect the evolution of the diagnostic process culminating in a final diagnosis. 17 The judgement of whether an MDO occurred is based on evidence contained in the case notes minimising subjective interpretation; nevertheless, variations in documentation and coding across practices make this assessment complex, and subject to reviewer judgements. Keeping one reviewer the same for all reviewed consultations may have increased consistency of assessments, but may have also induced some bias towards that reviewer's subjective viewpoints. Information on mitigating factors and other contextual information are often missing from case notes, making it difficult to determine what the clinician was thinking at the time of the diagnosis. Finally, ratings of harm severity were based on available evidence over the time span of the reviewed case notes, which may have failed to pick up the longer term impacts of some MDOs. Hence, in some cases, the true extent of harm may have been underestimated.",
