Results: In severe (or critical) COVID-19 patients, there is a remarkable expansion of TM4SF1+ and KRT5+ lung progenitor cells. The two distinct populations of progenitor cells could play crucial roles in alveolar cell regeneration and epithelial barrier reestablishment, respectively. The transplanted KRT5+ progenitors could long-term engraft into host lung and differentiate into HOPX+ OCLN+ alveolar barrier cell which restored the epithelial barrier and efficiently prevented inflammatory cell infiltration.",

Some but not all patients showed full functional recovery after the devastating lung damage, and so far there is little knowledge about the lung repair process. 1 Hyperplasia of type II alveolar cells (ATII) was also noted in most cases, which could suggest an undergoing regenerative process mediated by ATII lung progenitor cells. [2] [3] [4] [5] Recent animal studies demonstrated that the existence of multiple stem/progenitor populations in lung which have a potent effect to ameliorate pulmonary infection as well as inflammation and regenerate damaged bronchial and alveolar tissues. Previous reports have identified a rare population of Wnt-responsive ATII is regarded as the major facultative progenitors, 6, 7 which can be specifically marked by TM4SF1 expression in human lung. 8 Distal airway stem cells (DASCs) with potential in stem cell-based therapies for acute and chronic lung diseases have been identified, [9] [10] [11] [12] expressing SOX9, TP63 and KRT5, all known to play pivotal roles in the maintenance of stem/progenitor cell states and epithelial differentiation in multiple organ types both in development and during adulthood. [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] These DASCs were able to respond to injury induced by virus infection and assist airway and alveolar epithelial regeneration. 12 These properties suggest the mechanism of the repair process of COVID-19 patients by which multiple stem/progenitor populations work in concert.",

The current study was based on public scRNA-seq data sets on BALF cells from three patients with moderate COVID-19 (M1-M3), six patients with severe/critical infection (S1-S6) and four healthy controls (HC1-HC4) . 18, 19 Firstly, we performed unsupervised clustering analysis on the whole data set to separate EPCAM+/TPPP3+/KRT18+ epithelial cells from other cells types (mostly immune cells) in the BALF ( Figure S1A,B) . Re-clustering analysis identified 12 epithelial cell clusters, among them four were identified to be co-expressing immune markers which could be epithelial cells engulfed by leucocytes ( Figure S1C Figure 1E ). This phenomenon was not obvious in moderate COVID-19 patients, which was also consistent with previous pathological observation. 25 Therefore, the number of alveolar cells (or the alveolar marker gene expression level) in BALFs could be clinically used to measure the structural integrity of lung, which could serve as an index of disease severity for COVID-19 patients.",

Consistently, we observed co-expression of TM4SF1 and mature alveolar cell markers, AGER (also known as RAGE) and SPC, in a substantial proportion of TM4SF1+ cells (7.45% in average) in patients of severe group ( Figure 2C ). These results In order to examine the process whereby KRT5+ progenitor cells restore mature alveolar barrier in injured lung, we isolated the mouse KRT5+ progenitor cells (previously also named distal airway stem cells) 12 for transplantation assay as described in Figure 3A . Briefly, the cell population was trypsinized into single-cell suspension and a single-cell-derived pedigree clone was propagated, followed by GFP labelling by lentiviral infection for further analysis. Immunostaining showed that all cultured GFP+ KRT5+ progenitor cells expressed KRT5 and P63 marker genes ( Figure 3B ).

In addition, sense of low oxygen level through hypoxia pathway is known to be critical for the expansion of KRT5+ progenitors. 34 Here, we found that the hypoxia pathway component gene expressions were relatively low in P63+ Figure 4F ). So why the four patients have much more mature ABC than others? Interestingly, we found that generally the individuals' mature ABC cell numbers were positively correlated with their FCN1+ macrophage cell numbers in BALF (P = .002), and the patient S2, S4, S5 and S6 had much more FCN1+ macrophages in BALF than most of the other individuals ( Figure 4G ).

In brief, reads were demultiplexed, aligned to the human GRCh38 genome, and UMI counts were quantified per gene per cell to generate a gene-barcode matrix. Data were aggregated and normalized to the same sequencing depth, resulting in a combined gene-barcode matrix of all samples. Post-processing, including filtering by number of genes and mitochondrial gene content expressed per cell, was performed using the Seurat v.3. Genes were filtered out that were detected in less than three cells. A global-scaling normalization method 'LogNormalize' was used to normalize the data by a scale factor (10 000). Next, a subset of highly variable genes was calculated for downstream analysis and a linear transformation (ScaleData) was applied as a pre-processing step. Principal component analysis (PCA) dimensionality reduction was performed with the highly variable genes as input in Seurat function RunPCA.

TM4SF1+/KRT5+/ SOX9+) was identified, which will be analysed in details as below (Figures 1A, S2). When we compared the HC group with the other two infected groups, we found significant higher proportion of alveolar cell clusters (Cluster 6) in the BALF of patients with severe infection (Figure 1B-D). Of note, the HOPX+/AGER+ type I alveolar cells (ATI) and SPC+/LAMP3+ ATII were almost undetectable in the BALFs of healthy control persons due to the tissue integrity of their lungs. In contrast, in the severe COVID-19 patients, both ATI and ATII cell markers were detected in the lavage fluid, probably due to the tissue collapse and desquamation of alveolar cells (",

KRT5+ cells are also reported to have lung stem/progenitor characteristics. Such cells are originated from various primitive progenitors in proximal or distal airways and could expand/migrate to inflamed damaged lung parenchymal region to form 'KRT5 pods' once activated by various types of tissue injury including influenza virus infection. 9,12,27-30 Recent studies showed that the expanded KRT5 cells could give rise to new pulmonary epithelium, which was now believed to have important epithelial barrier function to protect the lung tissue from further damage. 8,30,31 Specific ablation of the newly expanded KRT5+ cells resulted in persistent hypoxaemia, confirming the contribution of these cells in recovery of lung function. 12 In the current study, we found that in the patients of severe group, the number of KRT5+ progenitor cells increased remarkably, in together with the elevated expression of another related progenitor marker gene SOX9 10,32 (Figure 2D, S2C). Then, we examined the function of genes whose expression level was significantly up-regulated in KRT5+ cells by Gene Ontology analysis. The results showed that KRT5+ cells were responsive to the low oxygen condition of severe COVID-19 patients and actively participated in the development and generation of respiratory epithelial system. More importantly, such cells highly expressed multiple tissue integrity genes including Claudin1, Claudin4, TJP1, Stratifin, AQP3 and Scnn1A, which were associated with epithelial barrier establishment, tight junction assembly, maintenance of fluid homeostasis and prevention of leucocyte mediated cytotoxicity (Figure 2E). These functions of KRT5+ cells were rather important for a damaged lung as reconstitution of tight alveolar barrier between atmosphere and fluid-filled tissue is required for recovery of normal gas exchange, while persistent disruption of the alveolar barrier could result in catastrophic consequences including alveolar flooding, 'cytokine storm' attack from the circulating leucocytes and subsequent fibrotic scarring. 33",

Altogether, these data showed that Notch and hypoxia pathways were important for the regulation of progenitor cell fate. Lastly, we mapped our scRNA-seq data of transplanted progenitor cells back to the COVID-19 BALF scRNA-seq data to investigate whether any mature alveolar barrier has been established in patients. We extracted the mature ABC gene expression signature and evaluated the signature signal in COVID-19 patients. The result showed that approximately 10% of the epithelial cells in BALF of severe patients could be annotated as mature ABC, and such ABC only existed in four severe patients (S2, S4, S5 and S6) but not in healthy persons or other patients (",
