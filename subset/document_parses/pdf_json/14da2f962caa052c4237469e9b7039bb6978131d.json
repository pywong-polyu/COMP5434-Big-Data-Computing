            "text": "The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. With some notable exceptions, safe and effective vaccines, which are now being widely distributed globally, have largely begun to stabilise the situation. However, emerging variants of concern and vaccine hesitancy are apparent obstacles to eradication. Therefore, the need for the development of potent antivirals is still of importance. In this context, the SARS-CoV-2 main protease (M pro ) is a critical target and numerous clinical trials, predominantly in the private domain, are currently in progress. Here, our aim was to extend our previous studies, with hypericin and cyanidin-3-O-glucoside, as potential inhibitors of the SARS-CoV-2 M pro . Firstly, we performed all-atom microsecond molecular dynamics simulations, which highlight the stability of the ligands in the M pro active site over the duration of the trajectories. We also invoked PELE Monte Carlo simulations which indicate that both hypericin and cyanidin-3-O-glucoside preferentially interact with the M pro active site and known allosteric sites. For further validation, we performed an in vitro enzymatic activity assay that demonstrated that hypericin and cyanidin-3-O-glucoside inhibit M pro activity in a dose-dependent manner at biologically relevant (\u03bcM) concentrations. However, both ligands are much less potent than the well-known covalent antiviral GC376, which was used as a positive control in our experiments. Nevertheless, the biologically relevant activity of hypericin and cyanidin-3-O-glucoside is encouraging. In particular, a synthetic version of hypericin has FDA orphan drug designation, which could simplify potential clinical evaluation in the context of COVID-19.",

The reaction mechanism of M pro involves acylation and deacylation stages. In the acylation step, the peptide bond is broken and the P1' fragment of the substrate is released [8, 13] . A covalent bond is formed between Cys145 of M pro and the carbon atom of the P1 residue, and this produces an acyl-enzyme complex [8, 13] . In the deacylation step, the acyl-enzyme complex is hydrolysed and the P1 fragment is released [8, 13] . In addition to the active site, potential allosteric sites have been identified [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] .

            "text": "There has been an intense research focus on the development of potential antivirals that target the SARS-CoV-2 M pro . Due to the cleavage site and substrate specificities of the M pro being different from human proteases, inhibitors are predicted to be non-toxic to humans [7, 10] . Potential inhibition of the SARS-CoV-2 M pro has largely focussed on covalent inhibitors of the protease with particular interest in the \u03b1-ketoamide analogues which have potent activity in the low micromolar range [10, 20, 21] . A nucleophilic attack occurs between the sulfur atom of Cys145 and the ketoamide group of \u03b1-ketoamide inhibitors, forming a thiohemiketal [10, 21] . In a study by Zhang et al., the hydroxyl (oxyanion) group of the thiohemiketal that was formed with the \u03b1-ketoamide inhibitor 13b and the catalytic Cys145 was stabilised by a hydrogen bond from His41 [10] . The amide oxygen of the inhibitor was found to accept a hydrogen bond from the residues Gly143, Ser144, and Cys145, which form the oxyanion hole [11, 21, 22] . The acyl-enzyme complex that covalent inhibitors form with M pro cannot be hydrolysed and they consequently remain bound to the active site [8] . Other key compounds which have shown potential include N3 (covalent inhibitor), GC376 (cysteine protease covalent inhibitor), the indole 5h (reversible covalent inhibitor), the indoline GRL-1720 (irreversible covalent inhibitor), ebselen (inhibition of M pro activity), and boceprevir (serine protease inhibitor that binds covalently) [9, 23, 24] .",

In a study by Islam et al., hypericin and cyanidin-3-O-glucoside were docked to the M pro and were selected as top-ranked candidates due to their strong binding affinity [35] . The stability of the protein-ligand complexes were evaluated further using MD simulations [35] Cyanidin-3-O-glucoside is a major anthocyanin that can be found in berries, while hypericin is an anthraquinone derivative that is found in the plant Hypericum perforatum (St. John's Wort) [36, 37] . The antiviral and immunomodulating effects of these compounds have been reported [38] [39] [40] [41] .

Docked ligands served as starting structures for simulations, with protein-ligand complexes for simulations containing two ligandsone bound to each protomer of M pro . Ligand topologies were generated using SwissParam [45] . Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were performed using GROMACS 2018.2 software [46, 47] with the CHARMM27 force field [48, 49] . Protein-ligand complexes were solvated using TIP3P water [50] in a dodecahedral box, with a minimum distance of 2.0 nm between any protein atom to the box edge. The solvated system was neutralized with sodium ions. Energy minimisation was performed using the steepest-descent gradient method. Systems were restrained using a canonical (NVT) ensemble followed by an isothermal-isobaric ensemble (NPT) for 100 ps. Temperature was maintained at 310 K with a modified Berendsen thermostat [51] , and pressure at 1.0 bar with the Parrinello-Rahman barostat [52] . Bond lengths were constrained using the LINCS algorithm [53] , and long-range electrostatic forces were calculated using the particle-mesh Ewald scheme (PME) [54] (grid spacing 0.16 nm). Cut-off ratios of 1.2 nm for Coulomb and van der Waals potentials were used for the calculation of short-range nonbonded interactions. Simulations were carried out for 1000 ns or 100 ns in triplicate with a time-step of 2 fs.",

The ligand is placed in randomly (around 40) initial poses at the protein surface. Here the ligand is fully solvated, that is with no direct contact with the protein. Then 256 computing cores start an adaptive-PELE Monte Carlo (MC) search. In the global sampling we combine large and short, ~3 and ~1 \u00c5, ligand translations. The adaptive procedure included 100 epochs of 10 MC steps each. Thus, in total we have around ~256 000 PELE steps.

            "text": "RMSF analysis indicated that the C-terminal tail of each protomer had the greatest flexibility in the protein (Fig. 1E) . Regions within the protein showing flexibility included residues 46-52 in domain I, and residues 187-191 of the connecting loop between domains II and III. The flexible domain I residues are in proximity to the hydrophobic S2 subsite involved in substrate binding [10] . Residues 46-52 are particularly flexible for all systems, with a maximum backbone RMSF of approximately 0.30 nm in protomer A for all systems studied except hypericin-bound M pro , with a value of 0.15 nm. For these residues in protomer B, backbone RMSF was lowest in the apo protein (~0.20 nm), with slightly higher values for the cyanidin-3-O-glucoside and hypericin isomer-bound (~0.30 nm), and the highest backbone RMSF for hypericin-bound M pro (0.48 nm). The flexible connecting loop residues also displayed some differences in fluctuation in response to ligand binding for protomer A, with a higher backbone RMSF of 0.52 nm for Gln189 in the apo protein, compared to 0.20, 0.24, and 0.25 nm for cyanidin-3-O-glucoside, hypericin, and hypericin isomer-bound M pro , respectively. In protomer B, differences between the systems were less obvious, with values of approximately 0.20 nm for all. Similar trends are observed with sidechain RMSF calculations, with a fluctuation of 0.85 nm for Gln189 in protomer A for the apo protein, compared to values of 0.44, 0.37, and 0.52 nm for cyanidin-3-O-glucoside, hypericin, and its isomer, respectively. For Gln189 in protomer B, the sidechain fluctuation was approximately 0.35 nm for all systems. As these connecting loop residues form part of the substrate binding site, it is suggested that ligand binding may stabilise these residues in protomer A of the M pro dimer. These differences in the flexibility of binding site residues may account for the observed preference for binding of ligands to protomer A over protomer B, as discussed below.",

As both hypericin and its isomer remained tightly bound to the substrate binding site in both chains of the M pro , a greater average number of contacts with key active site residues is observed. The catalytic dyad residues were among the residues with the greatest number of contacts with these ligands. His41 in protomer A had 120 contacts and 69 contacts in protomer B with hypericin, suggesting a preference for more favourable binding to protomer A. His41 made 43 and 42 contacts for its isomer bound to protomer A and B, respectively. For Cys145, hypericin had 46 and 30 contacts, while its isomer had 18 and 7 contacts in protomers A and B, respectively. Other notable key residues within the substrate binding site making contacts with these two ligands included Met49, Met165, and Gln189 across both protomers. This reaffirms the active site of M pro as a favourable binding region for hypericin.",

Local refinement of the best structures from global exploration revealed distinct minima for both ligands with strong interaction energies for the active site. Particularly for cyanidin-3-O-glucoside, the two best poses were in the active site of protomer A (Fig. 3) . Following refinement, the pose closest to the starting position (pose 1) had the lowest interaction energy of \u2212 86 kcal/mol. In this position, binding of cyanidin-3-O-glucoside in the active site is stabilised by an extensive hydrogen bond network, with half of these being formed with the glucoside group of the ligand. Key active site residues forming hydrogen bonds were Phe140, Asn142, Glu166 of the S1 subsite, and Tyr54 of the S2 subsite. The alternative orientation of the second pose also had a strong interaction energy (\u2212 78 kcal/mol) and was stabilised by hydrogen bond interactions with the same S1 subsite residues, with the addition of His163. In this pose (pose 2), the hydrogen bonds were all formed with the hydroxyl groups of cyanidin. For hypericin, the pose with the lowest interaction energy following refinement (\u2212 66 kcal/mol, pose 1) was also closest to the initial position in the active site of protomer A (Fig. 4) . The active site on protomer B was also found to be a binding site for hypericin shown in pose 5, albeit with a weaker interaction energy (\u2212 55 kcal/mol), further demonstrating a preference for substrate binding to protomer A.",

Interestingly, pose 3 identified by PELE simulations (\u2212 57 kcal/mol) overlapped with the cyanidin-3-O-glucoside following MD simulations. Pose 3 formed hydrogen bonds with prominent residues identified from contacts analysis Pro9, Lys12, Glu14, and Tyr154 (Fig. 2) , suggesting the presence of an alternative binding site on M pro . Pose 4 had an interaction energy of \u2212 62 kcal/mol, binding within the domain III interface of the dimer. This pose overlaps with a potential allosteric site we previously identified, forming hydrogen bonds with residues Phe3, Arg4, and Lys137 [15] . Domain III is involved in dimerization of M pro , which is regulated by a salt-bridge interaction between E290 and R4 of opposite protomers [58] . Pose 2 is also located within the dimerization domain and had an interaction energy of \u2212 55 kcal/mol. This pose corresponds to an allosteric site identified by G\u00fcnther et al. in a large scale x-ray crystallography screen and cell-based antiviral assays [14] . In their study, pelitinib bound in this pocket and demonstrated strong antiviral activity (EC 50 = 1.25 \u03bcM, CC 50 = 13.96 \u03bcM). Pose 2 of hypericin binds in a similar fashion, interacting with Ser301 from one protomer and Asn142 from the opposing protomer within the dimer. It has been reported that the integrity of this pocket is essential for enzyme activity [59] . Pose 2 also forms a hydrogen bond with Arg298, a vital residue for dimerization and stability of the S1 pocket [60] . ",

MD simulation trajectories spanning a microsecond have shown that hypericin preferentially binds in the substrate binding site in both protomers of the dimeric M pro , as well as known allosteric sites identified through PELE simulations. Finally, an in vitro enzymatic assay highlighted that both hypericin and cyanidin-3-Oglucoside inhibit M pro activity in a concentration-dependent manner, albeit with much less potency than known covalent M pro inhibitors such as GC376 used in our experiments. Nevertheless, potentially favourable bioactivity, toxicity and pharmacokinetic profiles may not completely rule out further investigation of these compounds. In this context, despite the checkered clinical history of hypericin, a synthetic version (SGX301, Soligenix, Inc.), has received an orphan drug designation from the US Food and Drug Administration for photodynamic therapy in cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. This clinical experience will be helpful for establishing protocols for potential evaluation of hypericin in a COVID-19 clinical setting.",
