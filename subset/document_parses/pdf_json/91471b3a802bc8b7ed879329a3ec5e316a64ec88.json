Importantly, COVID-19 can place PWDs at a higher risk of infection since some may already have compromised immune and respiratory systems and policy responses, such as social distancing, can lead to life-threatening disruptions in care for those that rely on home heath or personal assistants. Living in cities may already present healthdamaging challenges for PWDs, such as through lack of access to services and employment, physical barriers on streets and transportation, and smart-city technologies that are not made universally accessible. We suggest that the current pandemic be viewed as an opportunity for significant urban health reforms on the scale of the sanitary and governance reforms that followed ninetieth century urban epidemics.

Disability can impact key social determinants of health. For example, in the USA, 62% of PWDs (including physical, intellectual, and developmental; sensory; and other disability categories) are unemployed, 27% live below the poverty line [6] , and over 45% rated their health as \"fair or poor\" in 2018, making PWDs an often unrecognized health disparity population [7] . Urban health equity for PWDs means recognizing the immediate, acute care needs that they face but also reversing the social, physical, and often place-based determinants of poor health that have gone unaddressed in cities [8] .",

Part of the urban health equity challenge raised by the COVID-19 crisis and acknowledged by the UN is confronting the all too common medical model of disability, which defines people as disabled due to their impairments or differences [10] . Moving toward urban health equity in cities means implementing the social model of disability in all policies. The social model of disability views impairments as limitations of public policy, not people. For example, in urban health planning, a street intersection without a curb cut that limits a person in a wheelchair from crossing is a limitation and failure of urban design, policy, and planning, not the person. Further, in low-income countries around the world where 50-75% of the urban population lives in slums or informal settlements, the difficulties of social distancing for those with a disability should not be viewed as an individual challenge but rather a failure of land use, shelter, and infrastructure planning.",

A 2006 post-Hurricane Katrina and Rita report by the US National Council on Disabilities (NCD) noted that in New Orleans, \"people with disabilities were disproportionately affected by the Hurricanes because their needs were often overlooked or completely disregarded. Their evacuation, shelter, and recovery experiences differed vastly from the experiences of people without disabilities\" [11] . A 2010 US Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) report, \"Guidance on Planning for Integration of Functional Needs Support Services in General Population Shelters\", focused on what emergency managers and planners should do to ensure sheltering services and facilities are accessible, but does not mention how to handle \"shelterin-place\" conditions [12] . In the West African Ebola outbreak of 2014, Marais et al. noted the importance of including community knowledge, including that of PWDs, in educating different groups and in preventing transmission [13] . Wars in the Middle East, West and Central Africa, and other regions have left tens of thousands disabled, many of whom migrate to cities seeking care but are then denied access to schools, employment, and face stigma [14] . Armed conflict continues to increase the number of disabled children and has made girls and women especially susceptible to exploitation and infections, including HIV and other diseases [15] .",

In China, there was a case during the COVID-19 quarantine where a disabled teenager died after being left at home for 6 days without care, while his relatives were quarantined [17] . In Italy and other European countries, there were few messages communicated in accessible formats, and no specific measures were taken early in the crises for PWDs [18] . An early lesson is that cities must ensure that all public health messaging, technologies, and communications are accessible to all. For instance, during COVID-19, very few public announcements include sign language interpretation, and the ubiquity of face masks can further frustrate the ability of those who rely on lip-reading to understand and communicate.",

For example, the Standard Rules on the Equalization of Opportunity for Persons with Disabilities (1994) (A/RES/48/96) identify \"accessibility\" of the physical environment and of information and communication as two \"target areas\" to ensure equalization of opportunities. The Article 25 of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) reinforces the right of PWDs to attain the highest standard of health and health care, without discrimination [21] . Cities have been slow to comply with these directives, as they have \"left behind\" those with physical impairments by not adopting universal design principles in urban development, by ignoring the needs of PWDs in the adoption of new, smart city technologies, and through other forms of physical and social exclusion [22] .",

Indeed, persons with disabilities hold a privileged vantage point in understanding and dealing with crises and are a special asset in the current pandemic.

Economic hardship is furthered when PWDs are forced to pay more for essential life supports, such as utilities, transportation, and food. A 2019 study in the UK by John et al., called the \"Disability Price Tag,\" found that PWDs spent about 700 USD more a month than others, due to higher costs for transportation, utilities, care, and such things as accessible hotel rooms. These costs make it much harder for PWDs to build savings and plan for the future and make them extremely vulnerable to economic shocks, like the current coronavirus pandemic [26] . One policy response could be eliminating any restrictions governments may have on hiring family members to ensure continuity of care for PWDs.",

Cities should adopt more strict anti-discrimination and labor protection laws for PWDs and strengthen enforcement of such laws during this crisis to safeguard against unfair or discriminatory dismissal from work and/or needed care services. PWDs may also be receiving disability benefits, and these must not only continue on time but also may need to be enhanced to buffer the increased costs of living for PWDs stemming from the pandemic, such as the extra costs of home deliveries and/or hiring of private support due to the suspension of public services.",

Clearly, many of these suggestions should continue beyond the crisis and form an \"urban disability justice\" strategy, which can address systemic ableism in urban health research, policy, and planning [27] . The COVID-19 crisis can highlight and hopefully reveal policies to reverse the everyday crises and structural exclusion that PWDs face in cities [28] . The global pandemic must be viewed by global urban health advocates much like the urban epidemics of the nineteenth century, where urban sanitary and governance reforms helped improve population health [29] . However, some responses to the urban epidemics of the nineteenth and early twentieth century enhanced exclusion and segregation in cities, while others challenged colonialist, racist, and discriminatory urban health practices [30] . The COVID-19 crisis presents urban health practitioners with an opportunity to maintain the status quo, perpetuate even greater spatial segregation and exclusion, or to offer a vision for (re)building our cities to be more inclusive and healthier for all.",
