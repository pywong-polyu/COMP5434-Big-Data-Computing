            "text": "Physical factors affecting the survival of Tachypleus tridentatus eggs were investigated by translocating their eggs between the high intertidal zone and the low intertidal zone of a known spawning site. The mean egg survival rates per day were highest in the mid intertidal zone (45.1% \u00b1 25.4%) and the lowest in the low intertidal zone (13.3% \u00b1 27.6%). Differences in the elevation, air exposure time, and water content of the spawning ground were significant factors determining the egg survival rates. Excessive or insufficient air exposure time resulted in inadequate water content at higher and lower intertidal zones and could reduce egg survival. On the other hand, moderate saturation and dehydration were repeated with each tidal movement in the mid intertidal zone. This dynamic is considered as one of the crucial factors for the survival of eggs and is considered optimal for spawning. Therefore, the protection of the mid intertidal zone is imperative for maximizing the egg survival rate in Tsuyazaki Cove where almost all suitable nesting sites have disappeared due to coastal development. By protecting these optimal sites for spawning and recovering other optimal sites on suitable beaches, a positive contribution can be made to future management and conservation. The study also suggests that translocating eggs from marginal to optimal spawning sites might be a recovery strategy for this globally endangered species.",

They are important marine organisms in discussing the history of biological evolution (Rudkin and Young, 2009) . Four species of horseshoe crabs exist in the world, namely, the tri-spine horseshoe crab (Tachypleus tridentatus), the Atlantic horseshoe crab (Limulus polyphemus), the coastal horseshoe crab (Tachypleus gigas), and the mangrove horseshoe crab (Carcinoscorpius rotundicauda). Horseshoe crab eggs play an important role in coastal ecosystems as food resources for migratory birds (Botton and Shuster, 2003; Botton, 2009 ). In addition, horseshoe crab blood is the only natural resource that can rapidly detect bacterial endotoxins and therefore has been attracting attention in recent developments of new coronovirus vaccines (Witten-berg, 2021) . Thus, horseshoe crabs are not only biologically valuable but also medically and commercially important. However, many horseshoe crabs are currently declining worldwide due to overfishing and coastal development (Akbar et al., 2018; Laurie et al., 2019) .",

T. tridentatus lay their eggs only on the calm sandy beaches of inner bays. The species spawns in the intertidal zone between the extreme high tide line (EHTL) and the mean high water neaps (MHWN) (Sekiguchi, 1999) . However, the species that have lost suitable spawning sites due to coastal development may lay eggs at lower elevations than the MHWN (Sekiguchi, 1999) . In our study site, Tsuyazaki Cove, Japan, the number of T. tridentatus breeding pairs has decreased remarkably. One of the causes is the decrease of sandy areas suitable for spawning due to coastal development . Nesting at lower elevations than the MHWN was also found in our study site (Itaya et al., 2020) . Some studies point out that the survival rate of eggs in such an unfavourable environment is low (Penn and Brockman, 1994; Vasquez et al., 2015) . On the other hand, there are no field-based experiments on the effects of different elevations from high to low tide levels on T. tridentatus eggs. Therefore, there is a lack of quantitative data on the causal relationships between egg survival and coastal development impacts for the restoration and conservation of T. tridentatus spawning grounds.",

Today, the remnants of the salt farms and agricultural areas form the eastern hinterland of the cove, and the tiny mountainous coast is located on the west side of the cove. Tsuyazaki Cove is a lagoon-like inland sea. On the north side of the cove, a mudflat, which is a habitat for T. tridentatus juveniles, has formed. There are no large rivers flowing into this cove, and therefore it is considered that the cove is unique as a T. tridentatus habitat and that it is hardly affected by freshwater .

First, the site's elevation and latitude/longitude data were obtained using the Real-Time Kinematic-Global Navigation Satellite System (RTK-GNSS: Trimble R4 GNSS, Nikon-Trimble Co., Ltd.). Then these data were taken into Arc-GIS (ArcMap version 10.8, ESRI Japan Co., Ltd.) to create a digital elevation map of the site. Next, the EHTL and the MHWN were calculated from the local tide measured using a portable water depth meter (COMPACT-TD ATD-HR, JFE Advantech Co., Ltd.). Finally, the position of the high intertidal zone to the low intertidal zone within the translocation site was determined by overlaying EHTL/ MHWN and the digital map. In addition, to confirm the consistency of the elevation map, aerial photographs of the EHTL and the MHWN at the translocation site were taken using a drone (Spark, Dji Co., Ltd.).",

            "text": "T. tridentatus spawning activities take place at high tide during summer. A female crab digs holes in a sandy beach and lays eggs in the holes. Then a male crab releases sperm there to fertilize the eggs (Sekiguchi, 1999) . The eggs laid by the same breeding pair on 3 July 2019 on the same beach in our study site were collected for translocation on 4 July 2019. Since T. tridentatus has external fertilization, we assumed that fertilized eggs were distributed homogeneously in all translocated eggs. Two transect lines, transect A (A1 to A4) and transect B (B1 to B4), were placed on the sandy area of the translocation site. Four translocation points (A1 to A4, B1 to B4) were set on each transect line. The translocation points were located in the high intertidal zone (near the EHTL), upper-mid intertidal zone (between the EHTL and MHWN), lower mid intertidal zone (near the MHWN), and low intertidal zone (below the MHWN). Totally 100 eggs were translocated at each point of 8 locations (Fig.1b) . For translocating eggs, we used a plastic hydroponic mesh pot (600 mL) with a nylon net (mesh size 1 mm) spread out inside the pot to prevent egg loss and human disturbance as there are houses nearby, and many people use the site. The translocated eggs were placed in the pots together with the sand collected from the study site. The eggs were slightly separated from each other to prevent infection within the pot (Fig.2) . Then, the hydroponic pots were buried 15 cm below the surface of each translocation point on the transects. The translocated eggs were buried at a depth at which horseshoe crabs lay eggs in the wild, as Maeda et al. (2000) and Chen et al. (2004) described. Fig.2 A diagram of a hydroponic mesh pot (600 mL) used for translocating the eggs. A nylon net (mesh size 1 mm) was placed inside the pot to prevent egg loss. Totally 100 horseshoe crab eggs were placed in each pot together with local sand, and they were buried 15 cm below the ground surface, which is the depth at which the horseshoe crab spawns in the wild.",

After the stage of rotating eggs, the dispersion of the hatched larvae occurs, making it difficult to count the surviving eggs accurately. Therefore, we observed the eggs during the period from eggs (stage 1) to late embryos or rotating eggs (stage 21) based on the classification by Sekiguchi (1990) . There are some detailed reports on the development of T. tridentatus eggs in captivity (Sugita and Sekiguchi, 1981; Sugita et al., 1985; Sekiguchi, 1999) . However, unlike in captivity, it was impossible to observe the detailed developmental stages of horseshoe crab eggs in the field. Therefore, we did not categorize them; instead, we determined whether the eggs were alive or dead. Infected, decayed, and broken eggs were judged as dead eggs. During the inspection, the eggs at each point were quickly transferred to a plastic tray full of seawater to determine how many eggs were dead or alive. After counting the surviving eggs, we took their photographs and buried them in their original locations. Of the two transect lines, we inspected transect B at about two weeks intervals until August 21, 2019 to observe the survival status of the eggs. For transect A, we counted the final surviving eggs without digging until August 21, 2019.",

            "text": "The eggs translocated at the mid intertidal zone became rotating eggs (stage 21) after 44 days (August 16, 2019) at 27.40\u2103 \u00b1 2.52\u2103 and salinity of 28.5 \u00b1 3.6 (Table 1, Fig.4a) . Our results showed a similar development rate as a laboratory experiment conducted by Sekiguchi (1999) . In his experiment, the captive eggs reached stage 21 in 43 days at 30\u2103 and salinity of 20 to 35 (Sekiguchi, 1999) . It is thought that egg development proceeds at the same rate in the field as in captivity when conditions such as temperature and salinity are similar . The 'wild eggs' that were laid at the mid intertidal zone on the same beach, where our experiment was conducted, also became rotating eggs during the same period. It was observed that the 'wild The translocated eggs had the highest survival rate in the mid intertidal zone. Survival of eggs decreased at higher and lower elevations, especially 'inferior' in the low intertidal zone (Figs.3 and 4) . Ideally speaking, more replications should have been prepared for the experiment. However, we had difficulty preparing enough eggs for the experiment because of the rapid decline of T. tridentatus and thus a minimal number of breeding pairs came to our study site . Therefore, care should be taken in interpreting the results of the egg survival rate as sufficient statistical analysis could not be performed with the small number of replications. A follow-up experiment with more replications of translocated eggs is necessary to verify the current findings. Nevertheless, we can still conclude that there were differences in egg survival rate at different ele-vation points (Fig.4) . In addition, the GLM modeling showed that elevation from high tide to low tide was an important factor in determining egg survival rate (Fig.5a) , which is worthy with more attentions. The egg survival rate was the highest in the mid intertidal zone (B2 and B3). Of these eggs, 10% of B3 eggs finally developed to rotating eggs (Fig.4a) . There is almost no field-based research on the survival rate of T. tridentatus eggs in the wild. In Taiwan of China, Hsieh and Chen (2009) found that the hatching rate ranged from 0 to 88.5%, with an average of 33.9%, and a decline in hatching rates occurred in places where the tidal amplitude was small. In the experiment of Hsieh and Chen (2009) , there were three spawning areas, A, B, and C on the same beach, but the above survival rate was calculated for only 4 nests in area A where hatching was confirmed (the reason for the exclusion of areas B and C is unknown). However, if we included areas B and C where hatching was not confirmed, the total number of nests would be 12. Then, the average survival rate of 33.9% found by Hsieh and Chen (2009) could be divided by 12 nests instead of 4 nests, and then the survival rate would be about 11%. The egg survival rate in the mid intertidal zone (B3) of this study was 10% (Fig.4a) , which is almost the same as their conversion value. In addition, when we consider all of the translocated eggs in transect B, the number of surviving eggs is 10 out of 400 eggs, the survival rate is 2.5%. In summary, the range of egg survival rate in our study is from 2.5% (minimum) to 10% (maximum), which is not essentially different from the example reported by Hsieh and Chen (2009) . Therefore, it is assumed that the survival rate of T. tridentatus eggs obtained in this study may reflect the survival rate in the wild.",

In Malaysia as well, more than 50% of T. tridentatus spawning was concentrated in the mid intertidal zone (Mohamad et al., 2019) . The Atlantic horseshoe crab (Limulus polyphemus) laid their eggs between the high intertidal and the mid intertidal zones. Increased egg development was evident in both zones but decreased in the low intertidal zone (Vasquez et al., 2015) . Another study pointed out that L. polyphemus spawned in the mid intertidal zone which maximized their egg development rate by avoiding the dry and hot environment in the high intertidal zone and the oxygen-deficient condition in the low intertidal zone (Penn and Brockman, 1994) . Our results were consistent with these previous studies. The translocated eggs had the highest survival rate in the mid intertidal zone (Figs.4 and 5) . Although no other research was found on investigating T. tridentatus egg development at different elevations from high tide to low tide, it is thought that T. tridentatus select the mid intertidal elevations of the intertidal gradient for spawning.",

(2005) pointed out that the low intertidal zone is not suitable for spawning due to the amount of dissolved oxygen in the pore water is low in moist sand. A sandy beach takes in abundant oxygen at low tide when exposed to the air. Then, when it immerses in seawater at high tide, the oxygen in the sand dissolves into the seawater and finally is absorbed by the eggs. Therefore, T. tridentatus eggs develop better when the seawater is completely removed at a certain frequency than when they are constantly immersed in seawater (Sekiguchi, 1999) . Thus, the low egg survival rate in the low intertidal zone can be explained by the lack of air exposure time, resulting in excessive water content (Table 1) , which causes insufficient oxygen for the eggs.",

However, in the high intertidal zone, the water content temporarily increased during high tides but remained low over the other tidal periods. Furthermore, while other translocated points were submerged into seawater at least once a day, there were three times when the high intertidal zone was not submerged for more than a week during the study period. It accounted for 62% of the total time when the high intertidal zone was not immersed in seawater. In a laboratory experiment with the coastal horseshoe crab (Tachypleus gigas), Faizul et al. (2013) showed that eggs in sand develop well when immersed in seawater at a frequency of 1 to 3 days. It was suggested that when the eggs are not submerged in seawater for more than a week, desiccation may cause a poor egg development rate (Faizul et al., 2013) . Therefore, it is possible that dissolved oxygen did not reach the eggs sufficiently in the high intertidel zone as the immersion time and its frequency were extremely low in this study.",

The study revealed that the egg survival rate in the low intertidal zone was meager (Figs.4 and 5). Some breeding pairs of the area laid eggs in the low intertidal zone, suggesting there was probably a shortage of suitable spawning habitat (Itaya et al., 2020) . Hence, the egg survival rate of some of the breeding pairs is insufficient to sustain a viable population of horseshoe crabs in Tsuyazaki Cove. It may be necessary to translocate eggs laid in the low intertidal zone to the mid intertidal zone to increase their survival rate. However, as described below, the translocation of the eggs alone may not be sufficient for the recovery of the natural population in Tsuyazaki Cove.",

As a result, the number of breeding pairs has decreased yearly with this habitat deterioration. Over the last decade, more than 90% of breeding pairs have disappeared from our study site due to the development. Currently, the number of spawning pairs coming to the beach every year is only 4 to 10 pairs . Thus, the spawning grounds at Tsuyazaki Cove have degraded over time, and natural recovery of the spawning grounds and the population cannot be expected. Therefore it is urgent to protect the remaining suitable spawning sites and restore those sites which are degraded. We believe it is urgent to secure the mid intertidal zone for maximizing the egg survival rate in Tsuyazaki Cove by protecting what remains of it and by recovering other suitable sites for spawning. It is even possible to design and build artificial spawning sites. For these practical conservation measures, further research studies will be necessary to estimate the remaining suitable spawning grounds and those degraded ones. This is especially important for the recovery strategies of specific species.",

            "text": "In this study, the relationship between Tachypleus tridentatus egg survival and the physical characteristics of the spawning ground was revealed for the first time. It was found that the difference in elevation from high tide to low tide was a key factor in determining the egg survival. With medium elevation, air exposure time, water content and sediment types were all suitable for egg survival. Under such conditions, the duration of the beach exposed to air and the water content in the sand caused by the difference in elevation was essential for the eggs to survive, suggesting that the mid intertidal zone is the most suitable for spawning. In higher and lower intertidal zones, excessive or insufficient air exposure time reduced egg survival. In the mid intertidal zone, moderate saturation and dehydration were repeated with each tidal movement and this dynamic is considered as one of the crucial factors for the survival of the translocated eggs in Tsuyazaki Cove. Thus, the protection of mid intertidal zones as optimal spawning sites will contribute positively to the future management and conservation of this globally endangered species. Moreover, translocating eggs to the optimal spawning sites from marginal sites can also be a recovery strategy.",
