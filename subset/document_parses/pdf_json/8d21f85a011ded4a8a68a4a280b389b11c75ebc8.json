This study seeks to investigate 'How other actors have perceived China's role as a responsible power amid the COVID-19 crisis'. To do so, we opt for a qualitative approach examining the official Twitter accounts of seven actors that hold different types of relationships with China, namely Brazil, EU, Japan, Iran, Pakistan, Russia, and the USA. We aim to identify the perceptions of these actors towards China as unfolding from January to June 2020, emphasising the empirical applicability of Twitter's discourse. By adopting the concept of responsible power approached from a Role Theory perspective, this paper contributes to a more nuanced understanding of interstate relations and role perceptions. Our findings indicate that there have been variations in the responses and perceptions other states have expressed towards China while its framing as a responsible power differs significantly during the crisis and its landmark events.",

Lastly, the designation of these actors as great and emerging powers addresses theoretical preconditions that they need to act as responsible powers (Deng 2008; Wu 2010) .",

To do so, we employ systematic framing analysis and qualitative content analysis as analytical techniques (D'Angelo and Kuypers 2010) to discover the valence towards China and the presence of a responsible power frame by examining official statements in Twitter. Valence is an important element in conveying attitudes because it reveals emotion, sentiment, or tone (Kiousis 2004) . In this study, valence is understood as the tone of a message or a story related to an issue (Lams 2016) .",

Brazil, Japan, Iran and the EU in this ascending order show a positive valence, but overall, they adopt a more neutral valence in their tweets while the presence of China as a responsible power frame is sporadic. The USA, on the contrary, holds a highly negative valence and has framed the country in an opposing manner, an irresponsible power. These contradictions are indicative of a highly polarised international environment and the influence of important events in the trajectory of the COVID-19 crisis. 4 The Government of Japan. (2021).

            "text": "The study of Role Theory originated from Holsti's work in the 1970s when he raised the question of states' national role conceptions and their behaviour in foreign policy. Later, authors such as Thies (2009) and Harnisch et al. (2011) established themselves in the subject by strengthening this theoretical approach's foundations and bringing it closer to the field of international relations. Role theory investigates patterns of foreign policy behaviour based on how the actor perceives its position vis\u00e0-vis outsiders' expectations and reactions (Breuning 2019) . This interaction of corresponding self-perceptions and perceptions by others results in specific roles (Thies 2009; He and Walker 2015) . Thies (2009) , Harnisch et al. (2011) , Wehner and Thies (2014) investigate three types of interconnected and interbehavioural roles. The first refers to the role conception, which is the actor's self-perception of its social position vis-\u00e0-vis others in the international system. The construction of this role derives from the beliefs, values, culture, and history internalized by the actor and the disposition of its material capacities. The second one, namely role performance, is related to the real behaviour of an actor's foreign policy, which is conducted by the social functions assumed by its self-perception. Finally, the actor's self-conception is also closely linked to the external perceptions communicated through language and action (Thies 2009; Harnisch et al. 2011) . The third type, thus, consists of role expectations shaped by domestic norms and preferences, the political scenario configurations (Mehmetcik and Belder 2018) , and the direct observation regarding the performance of any actor in a social position. Those roles are assigned based on a value dimension of the actor's capacity; \"other states' expectations are guided in part by assessments of a state's capacity to act\" (Breuning 2019, p. 06) . This evaluation results from the actor's mobilisation of both material and immaterial resources. Nonetheless, expectations are subject to variation and role conflicts. Certain functions performed by the actor may not receive the same level of recognition from outsiders in terms of its social position (Mehmetcik and Belder 2018) .",

On the other hand, when receiving role assignments from third parties, the actor can choose to reject, perform or transpose this role.

As an alternative, the actor can perform the assigned social role by changing its meaning according to its interest (Mehmetcik and Belder 2018) .",

Similarly, role assignments necessitate the ability to persuade others to fulfil delegated functions. In other words, altercasting is a process that implies a \"conscious manipulation of one's role-taking behaviour to (re)shape the role of another actor, presumably a counter-or commensurate role\" (Harnisch 2011, p. 13 ). This process is vital for China and its aspirations for a peaceful rise, because \"in the struggle for existence and power \u2026what others think about us is as important as what we actually are. The image in the mirror of our fellow's mind \u2026determines what we are as members of society\" (Morgenthau 1963, p. 73) . To that end, role theory serves as an important analytical lens that can further investigate and comprehend the interplay between an actor's image and the role perceptions of other states to establish and promote a role (Harnisch et al. 2011) . As a result, the theory provides foundations and conceptual principles for elucidating the diverse perceptions of China's role as responsible power during the COVID-19 pandemic.",

The term refers to relational linkages that can be interpreted as a social role assignment influenced by both the international community's perception and the actor's conception. This implies that each country holds its own view of what responsibility means and what it entails. As explained by Richardson (2011, p.288 ) \"the standards for defining a responsible power are context-specific and in the eye of the beholder\". According to Liping (2001) , a responsible power should contribute to regional and world peace efforts and participate in formulating international law. As such Great powers, due to their relative resources, assume a caretaker or a managerial role in the international system (Viola 2020) .",

The pandemic has further isolated Iran, opening space for greater dependence on Beijing (Lim 2020) . Amid the COVID-19 crisis, Iran was the first country to receive medical teams from China, while Beijing also advocated for the suspension of sanctions that made it challenging to import medicines and medical equipment. Iranian ambassador Mohammad Keshavarz Zadeh emphasised the Chinese transparency in providing COVID-19 information, statistics and recommendations that have benefited the Iranian government in alleviating the effects of the crisis (Wenting 2020) .",

As pointed out by Saarela (2018, p. 06) , \"the EU expects China to assume responsibilities in line with its global impact and to support the rules-based international order\". Nonetheless, tensions in their relationship led to characterisations of China as an economic competitor and systemic rival in 2019 (R\u00fchlig 2020) . During the COVID-19 crisis, trade ties among some EU member states and China were strengthened. The EU provided supplies to China when the country was the epicentre, and China later assisted European members with medical aid.

That led to a series of assertive statements from both sides and an intensive and costly trade war (Medeiros 2019) . Moreover, China's designation as a strategic competitor and a revisionist state in official American documents 15 indicated a somewhat competitive stance towards China, having many scholars attributing these developments under the spectrum of great power politics and the rising of a bipolar international system (Goldstein 2020) . The COVID-19 crisis further strained the already tense relations between the two countries. The American president repeatedly accused China of cover-up and failing to control the spread of the pandemic. Additionally, he adopted a series of measures that included restricting travel from China and imposing limits on Chinese students travelling while also threatening to ban Chinese social media applications (Dissis and Hansler 2020). Both sides have also engaged in a social media narrative confrontation around the COVID-19 pandemic that even signalled a change in Twitter policy by flagging and fact-checking politician tweets, including President Trump's and Chinese government spokespeople (Galbraith 2020 ",

The following month, the country became the epicentre of the epidemic, and the government implemented a series of prevention and control measures (Gong et al. 2020) , while the WHO Director-General declared the novel coronavirus outbreak a public health emergency of international concern on January 30, 2020 (WHO 2020a, b).",

In addition, the spread of coronavirus outside China's borders and its adverse consequences prompted a widespread backlash against China for failing to report its efforts to combat coronavirus in a transparent manner, with many states summoning Chinese ambassadors for explanations (Erlanger 2020) . Alongside accusations of disinformation campaigns and fake news spread on COVID-19, an unfavourable international environment towards China was cultivated. 20 Finally, in May and June, the first announcements of vaccine trials by various states were made, paving the way for a global competition dubbed a global arms race, which exacerbated a nationalist component to a global crisis (Sanger et. al. 2020 ).",

However, as the disease spreads beyond Chinese borders, we see a decrease in the number of tweets with a positive valence from all actors. In comparison, after the declaration of COVID-19 as a pandemic in March, a more neutral valence developed. In contrast, after April, when the pandemic had spread to many other countries that had to impose national lockdowns and criticisms of China were increasing, the neutral valence also significantly decreased. This indicates resistance in openly acknowledging China's performance in a highly polarised environment that promoted inward national policies, and interregional initiatives were scarce. Nonetheless, most actors lacked a negative tone, except for one tweet from Russia, Brazil and the USA, which maintained a negative tone against China for months. Figure 3 shows the explicit references of China as a responsible power frame and outlines whether the referred countries have framed China as a responsible power emphasising its efforts to provide timely and transparent information, assist in multilateral initiatives and provide humanitarian aid. It also accounts for the irresponsible power frame with accusations of concealing information, not upholding good international practices and global health standards. The results show that the responsible power frame is not consistently present in most actors. It is observed that Pakistan, in its online political discourse, has the highest number of the responsible power frame (18) followed by Russia (5) and the EU (4) while Iran follows with (3), Japan (2) and Brazil only with 1. On the contrary, the USA has framed China as an irresponsible power 31 times. Table 2 provides an analytical depiction of China's framing as an (ir)responsible power per month. Based on the findings, we can conclude that the responsible power frame is most prevalent in January and February. On the other hand, we only had Pakistan, the EU, and Russia acknowledging this frame between April and June. Furthermore, in all the months recorded, the USA is the only one to present and portray China as an irresponsible power to a very high degree.",

In addition, the framing of China as a responsible power is neither highly visible, constant nor at the level expected from Russia, further confirming considerations on the ambiguity of their relationship (Papageorgiou and Vieira 2021a) .

Russia's reluctance to adopt a consistently positive tone and frame China as a responsible power stem from its own difficulties in persuading others to recognize its own status as such for its own attempts to gain recognition from the West during COVID-19. As a result, Moscow's reluctance to recognize Beijing as a responsible power originates from its insecurities that such recognition will place it as a junior partner in the two states relationship.",

Even so, China's frame as a responsible power is not highly mentioned in European tweets. After April, the neutral attitude towards China refers to the EU's more coordinated internal response to the control of COVID-19 and criticism of China's involvement in disinformation campaigns and identification of failures in Chinese medical supplies (Brattberg and Le Corre 2020) . Furthermore, China's assistance and diplomatic approach to the EU during the pandemic was contested and portrayed as a propaganda operation (Walkowicz 2020) . Moreover, China's mask diplomacy raised European awareness of its overdependence on Chinese industry and production chains and its somewhat fragmented response to the pandemic (Santander and Vlassis 2021) that endangers its own role as perceived by its own members. Thus, China was seen by the EU as a self-interested actor that uses its power of influence through the strategy of mask diplomacy to promote its own interests and not as a responsible power willing to share global costs.",

However, Japan's latest measures and neutral valence reveal a certain level of hesitation in openly assuming China as a responsible power, given the country's relations with the USA. As a result, the role expectations of China as a responsible power were short-lived as soon as US-China relations became seriously strained from February, with Japan maintaining a delicate balancing act between its reliance on the US for security and its economic relationship with China.",

However, as the disease spread beyond Chinese borders, there was a decrease in the number of positively valenced tweets, and the frame of responsible power diminished. Even China's closest partners, Russia and Iran, resisted recognising China as a responsible power systematically. From the actors under analysis, only Pakistan acknowledges and frames China as a responsible power, while the USA framed the country in an opposing manner, an irresponsible power.
