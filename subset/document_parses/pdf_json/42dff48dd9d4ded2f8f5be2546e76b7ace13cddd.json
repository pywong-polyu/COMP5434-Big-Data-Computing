In this study, multiple saliva omics from an individual were monitored over three periods (100 timepoints) involving: (1) hourly sampling over 24 h without intervention, (2) hourly sampling over 24 h including immune system activation using the standard 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine, (3) daily sampling for 33 days profiling the post-vaccination response. At each timepoint total saliva transcriptome and proteome, and small RNA from salivary extracellular vesicles were profiled, including mRNA, miRNA, piRNA and bacterial RNA. The two 24-h periods were used in a paired analysis to remove daily variation and reveal vaccination responses. Over 18,000 omics longitudinal series had statistically significant temporal trends compared to a healthy baseline. Various immune response and regulation pathways were activated following vaccination, including interferon and cytokine signaling, and MHC antigen presentation. Immune response timeframes were concordant with innate and adaptive immunity development, and coincided with vaccination and reported fever. Overall, mRNA results appeared more specific and sensitive (timewise) to vaccination compared to other omics. The results suggest saliva omics can be consistently assessed for non-invasive personalized monitoring and immune response diagnostics.",

Major efforts have concentrated on evaluating disease risk from genomic information 1,2 , including direct to consumer platforms, like 23andMe 3 , as well as pharmacogenomic evaluations 4 . Implementing omics profiling in the clinic will require evaluation of patients over time. The utility of such profiling has been evaluated in individual monitoring pioneered in the integrative Personal Omics Profiling (iPOP) study 5 , and expanded recently to include profiling using electronic health devices 6 . The Pioneer study 7 also incorporated behavioral coaching to improve clinical biomarkers based on participants' individual data. Additional developments have included utilizing host-microbiome data in insulin resistant individuals in a study of weight gain 8 and in prediabetics 9 , investigating biological age 10, 11 as well as monitoring of astronauts in the recent NASA twin study 12 .",

There has been long-standing interest in saliva for non-invasive diagnostics and health monitoring, and saliva omics is an emerging field, with broad profiling that includes total saliva RNA and proteomes, as well as cell-free RNA identification, extracellular vesicle (EV) profiling, miRNAs as biomarkers, and salivary microbiomes [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] . Utilizing saliva for non-invasive monitoring is important in evaluating vulnerable populations, including infants, children, older adults and immunocompromised individuals. Additionally, saliva is important in evaluation of health in remote or underserved locations, when limited resources are available, where processing of blood samples might not be feasible, or a physician may not even be available. Such monitoring is also of particular interest for evaluating active personnel, including astronauts in deep space missions. The recent twin astronaut study evaluated multi-omics utility but also highlighted the logistic issues of using blood samples when these cannot be processed on-site 12 . The COVID-19 pandemic has additionally ignited interest in the use of saliva for rapid diagnostics, towards a rapid and minimally invasive diagnostic that can be used without risk to personnel www.nature.com/scientificreports/ (possibly as a home-use kit), including profiling viral loads (from posterior oropharyngeal samples) 26 , and current work continues to evaluate the sensitivity of saliva for practical implementations [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] .",

The two time periods, TFH1 and TFH2, were treated as paired and combined in the analysis below ( TF ) to identify changes induced by the vaccination, by effectively removing daily normal routine effects for this individual.

Figure 1 . Study overview. The study followed an individual over the span of a year, collecting 100+ saliva samples. In this manuscript we discuss three time frames of interest for saliva sampling: (1) TFH1, where 24 hourly samples were taken, (2) TFH2, where 24 hourly samples were taken but the subject was also vaccinated with PPSV23 during this time frame, (3) TFD, where daily samples were taken. At each timepoint unstimulated saliva was collected (at a rate \u223c 500 \u00b5 l/min ). 3 ml of saliva were stored directly and subsequently used to extract extracellular vesicle RNA, and proteins for mass spectrometry proteome profiling. Furthermore, 2 ml saliva was collected with Oragene (DNAGenotek) kits, which contain a stabilizer, and used to profile total saliva transcriptomics using RNA-sequencing; see \"Methods\" for further collection and processing details. The data were used to generated time series with MathIOmica, which revealed multiple trends corresponding to response to immunization with PPSV23. Total saliva proteomics. We profiled the total saliva proteome, using isobaric tandem mass tags (TMT) for quantitation using LC-MS/MS (liquid chromatography followed by mass spectrometry). We identified 12,473 proteins overall, with 4141 proteins (UniProt identifiers 38 ) based on 2 unique peptides per protein, (11,005 proteins based on 1 unique peptide per protein) overall across all 95 samples where proteomics was carried out. Relative protein intensities were computed against a common pooled sample comprising of multiple healthy (pre-vaccination) weekly samples that was used across all TMT sample pools. The data were thus combined, and normalized using a Box-Cox 39 transformation to obtain normal distributions. To construct the time series, the data were filtered again for 2 unique peptides, having less than 1/4 missing values, and no constant time series to obtain 724, 956, 759, and 662 proteomics time series for TFH1, TFH2, TF and TFD respectively.

The different biotypes per sample (Fig. 3b) , for the TFH1, TFH2 and TFD time frames are indicative of a change in the relative distributions of the biotypes for the daily samples following the vaccination (increase of exogenous genomes content).

Our classification successively identifies time series from the dataset that have statistically significant autocorrelations at particular time lags. In summary (see \"Methods\"), MathIOmica's classification generates three sets of classes, strictly based on temporal behavior: (1) significant autocorrelations at various lags, (2) no autocorrelations, but with positive spikes (abnormally high signals above baselines present at single timepoints), (3) no autocorrelations, but negative spikes present (abnormally low signals below baseline at single timepoints). Within each class a two-tier classification into groups and subgroups www.nature.com/scientificreports/ is carried out: this approach first separates within-class autocorrelation groups by clustering on autocorrelation lags: signals that may have statistically significant autocorrelation for the class lag, but may still exhibit underlying different structure at other lags. Additionally, the second level clustering into subgroups is based on intensities, and allows us to separate signals that may have different phase (directionality/sense), which cannot be obtained from the periodograms. The analysis was carried out for each of the omics individually and thousands of individual component trends were identified in the different classes and subgroupings therein. A brief summary is provided in Table 1 . The entirety of visualizations and classification memberships are available in the online data files (ODFs), including heatmaps per omic per individual time frame trends, as well as all the code to generate these. We also combined all the classified information to obtain an integrated view of the various omics. Below we showcase parts of the mRNA analysis, as well the results of all the omics combined.",

Following vaccination of a subject with pneumococcal vaccine (PPSV23) we were able to detect distinct signatures in various saliva omics. We were able to profile more than 65,000 components in various time frames over time, and identify 18,000+ time series that had statistically significant temporal trends. The time series trends observed were indicative of immune response, which coincided in timing with the vaccination, and fever reported by our subject. The time frames of immune responses observed are concordant with our expectations of innate and adaptive immunity development, as seen both in the immediate hourly as well as the short-and long-term daily responses observed. Various pathways were activated, involved in immune response and regulation, including interferon signaling and MHC antigen presentation. The immune activation spanned an initial response within hours, as well as long term response extending for over a month.",

            "text": "Our results suggest that saliva omics can be consistently assessed for personalized monitoring. While multiple omics provide responses post-vaccination as discussed for the TF and TFD time frames, mRNA results appear more specific and sensitive (timewise) to the vaccination. EV response, particularly transcript-level (GENCODE), though very sensitive and responsive does not yield as specific results as the mRNA from total saliva in a nontargeted approach. In fact many EV mRNAs show statistically significant temporal responses, which is likely due to increased EV release from various cells, but not specific in terms of reflecting the functional responses in the cells of origin. EV results also suggest a lagged response by a few hours compared to the mRNA observations, which also suggests that the mRNA measurements can potentially provide more timely data for practical health monitoring. Additional omics showed responses concordant with the mRNA responses, including miRNA, piRNA and exogenous taxa quantitations, however these need further validation, particularly as our knowledgebase of pathway implications and functional important of such omics is still under development. Some of the omics time series are found in responses across hourly and daily samplings (Table 4) , and such sets of omics can be targeted for non-invasive health monitoring. The processing of samples for mRNA involved the use of standardized kits that can be used by subjects remotely, and can facilitate storage of samples for about a month without refrigeration. Additionally, the mRNA sequencing preparation and result analysis are considerably faster than the other omics processing, so our recommendation based on our findings is to utilize similar approaches for mRNA broad profiling, while using targeted protein/EV-content assays. These omics must be coupled with standard physiological and molecular measures already utilized in the clinic for a complete assessment of health status. While our results are based on PPSV23 activation, we anticipate that they can be extended to additional vaccine and immune disease profiling, particularly with the goal of discovering immune-specific signatures for each affliction and/or intervention.",

Such efforts were substantially improved by Grassl et al. who used deep profiling by mass spectrometry to identify more than 3700 human proteins 54 . Their study also assessed intra-day changes for waking and postprandial collection times, identifying enrichment of proteins associated with 'antibiotic' keywords in waking versus postprandial collection times. Our study significantly extends the temporal profiling aspect to hourly 24 h period monitoring (for 4141 proteins-UniProt IDs, with > 2 unique peptides used per identification), in addition to daily data for a month. We also observed substantial variability during the course of a day. To account for this daily variation, we used a paired two 24 h period comparison to elucidate changes particular to the vaccination (essentially subtracting normal hourly variation effects), and also limited collection to a single morning timepoint in our daily collection. Other studies of the saliva proteome have included the integration of transcriptomics with antibody-based proteomics [55] [56] [57] to assess the salivary gland content (Human Protein Atlas), suggesting up to 15,218 proteins are expressed in the gland itself, though these studies did not dynamically profile secreted saliva.",

Furthermore, due to limited samples and resources, we did not carry out immune profiling, such as cytokine assays or functional assays to assess the immune acquisition to the different components in the PPSV23 vaccine. We were also unable to obtain blood samples across all the time points, as our focus was a first evaluation of saliva omics. Additionally, our study did not specifically target the salivary microbiome, and the meta-analysis of EV RNA content indicated substantial www.nature.com/scientificreports/ variability in overall taxa, the composition of which is expected to vary across individuals. In the next stage of our long-term project we have already collected samples from multiple subjects being vaccinated at the same time points with PPSV23 and monitored over multiple timepoints. Given further resources, our goal is to utilize these samples to both validate and extend our findings to also include monitoring of blood components. By comparing the responses in blood and saliva we will be able to assess to what extend saliva may be used as a proxy for blood monitoring, identifying common and different responses in different tissues. Finally, in monitoring total saliva omics in bulk, we are ignoring the multi-cellular composition of saliva. With the availability of single-cell RNA-seq methodology, we anticipate that we will be able to also assess the cell-type-specific response in saliva. In summary, saliva provides a promising venue for non-invasive diagnostics of immune response. This is particularly important for enhancing our diagnostic capabilities for multiple viral or bacterial responses, particularly in cases where blood may not be easily available, due to technical issues, remote locations (e.g. monitoring active personnel), lack of specialized equipment and healthcare availability (e.g. due to socio-economic factors), patient vulnerability (immuno-compromised, children, and elderly populations). Given the current pandemic (COVID-19), enhancing our diagnostic capabilities has become a high priority.

The signal's periodogram is obtained using a Lomb-Scargle transformation [43] [44] [45] to account for uneven sampling, P LS .
