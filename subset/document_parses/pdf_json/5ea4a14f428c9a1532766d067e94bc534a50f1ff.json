However, how the changes of stability on surfaces would influence the role of fomite route in SARS-CoV-2 transmission is still unknown. In this study, we modeled the Omicron and ancestral strain SARS-CoV-2 transmission within a household over 1-day period from multiple pathways, i.e., airborne, droplet and contact route. We assumed there were 2 adults and 1 child in the household, and one of the adults was infected with SARS-CoV-2. We assume a scenario of pre-/asymptomatic infection, i.e., SARS-CoV-2 was emitted by breathing and talking, and symptomatic infection, i.e., SARS-CoV-2 was emitted by breathing, talking, and coughing. In pre-/asymptomatic infection, all three routes contributed a role, contact route contribute most (37%-45%), followed by airborne route (34%-38%) and droplet route (21%-28%). In symptomatic infection, droplet route was the dominant pathway (48%-71%), followed by contact route (25%-42%), airborne route played a negligible role (<10%). In the contact route, indirect contact (fomite) route dominated (contributed more than 97%). Compared with ancestral strain, though the contribution of contact route increased in Omicron variant transmission, the increase was slight, from 25%-41% to 30%-45%.",

In this study, we considered the following two scenarios: 1) asymptomatic or presymptomatic infection, i.e. infected individuals shed viruses into the environment via breathing and talking. Breathing and talking for 2 minutes would expel 2.4\u00d7 10 and 7.1\u00d7 10 mL saliva, respectively. During asymptomatic or presymptomatic infection, we assumed that 49.5% and 49.5% of the exhaled droplets by the patient were partitioned to porous and non-porous surfaces, and the rest 1% deposited on the infector's hands. 2) symptomatic infection, i.e. infected individuals shed viruses into the environment via breathing, talking and coughing. And one cough would expel 0.17 mL saliva, and the cough frequency was 30 per hour. And during symptomatic infection, we assumed that 89% and 10% of the exhaled droplets by the patient were partitioned to porous and non-porous surfaces respectively (Mizukoshi et al., 2021) , since the patient would lie in bed most time. The rest 1% deposited on the infector's hands. Detailed size distribution of droplets from breathing, talking and coughing are in Supplementary Information Part 1.

In contact transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in household, indirect contact route dominated. This may be mainly due to that the frequency of hand-to-environmental surfaces contact (3 times per hour) was much higher than the frequency of hand-to-hand contact (0.1-0.5 times per hour), and the hand hygiene frequency was 0.5 per hour, but the environmental surfaces were not cleaned, so the virus concentration on environmental surfaces was higher than these on the hands (Supplementary Information Part 3 Figure S5 ). And because of the relative higher hand-to-hand contact between the susceptible child and the infector, thus direct contact route contributed more in contact transmission of SARS-CoV-2 for the susceptible child ( Figure 4 ).

In the animal experiment study, the absolute risk of airborne, droplet and overall risk are 0, 3/10 and 7/13 respectively, thus simply considering inclusion and exclusion of contact transmission, the estimated contribution of airborne, droplet and contact route could be 0%, 57% and 43% respectively. This tendency was consistent with the results when the infector was symptomatic. In the modelling studies by Jones (2020) and Mizukoshi et al. (2021) , they both considered the virus emission via coughing, and in the study by Jones (2020), the author even only considered the virus emission via coughing. Jones found that droplet and airborne routes predominated, contributing 35% and 57% respectively in hospital. Mizukoshi et al. (2021) found that airborne route was much less important than contact route and droplet route, only contributing 4%-10% in SARS-CoV-2 transmission in hospital. This was consistent with the results when the infector was symptomatic in this study. In addition, Mizukoshi et al. (2021) found that the role of droplet route decreased with the increase of virus concentration in saliva, contributing 65%-70% when the virus concentration was 10 1 -10 4 /mL, and 20%-46% when the virus concentration was 10 5 -10 8 /mL.

In our study, we found that the role of contact route increased slightly in Omicron variant transmission, no more than 5%. Therefore, contact transmission is not enough to cause too much concern. In contrast, we found that with the increase of pre-/asymptomatic infections in Omicron strain transmission (Garrett et al., 2022) compared with ancestral strain, airborne route should gain more attention in SARS-CoV-2 transmission and prevention. When the infector was symptomatic, airborne route played a negligible role (<10%), but this pathway became important (34%-38%) when the infector was asymptomatic or presymptomatic. This study has several limitations. Firstly, the results depend on the model assumptions.",

In other public places such as shopping malls, restaurants, etc., the dominant route may be different, thus we would further study scenarios of the other settings in the future study. Last, the behavioral settings of the susceptible adult and the susceptible child are the same, however, children may touch more surfaces and wash their hands less often, which may lead to a higher risk of contact transmission in children. Therefore, the overall infection risk of the susceptible child was about half that of the susceptible adult, this conclusion may vary under different settings. In a word, the overall risk of COVID-19 infection predicted by the model should be interpreted with caution, though within result comparisons remain informative.",

As a respiratory infection, SARS-CoV-2 is believed to be mainly transmitted by direct contact, droplet, fomites, and airborne route (WHO, 2020). Exploring the relative importance of different transmission route is crucial for developing targeted infection control strategies. However, it remains unclear to what extent the different transmission routes contributing to SARS-CoV-2 transmission within human beings. Modelling studies have evaluated the relative importance of different routes for SARS-CoV-2 wild strain in health-care settings (Jones, 2020; Mizukoshi et al., 2021) or households (Lei et al., 2021), and suggested that droplet and airborne transmission routes predominate over the contact route. Fomites as a mode of SARS-CoV-2 transmission were thought to play an important role at the beginning of the pandemic, with laboratory studies revealing the SARS-CoV-2 could persist on plastic, stainless steel and other surface for hours to days (Chin et al., 2020; Pastorino et al., 2020; Marcel et al., 2020). By May 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) and other agencies were recommending carefully and thoroughly wash their hands and disinfect those frequently touched surfaces.

Contact route includes direct and indirect contact. Direct contact refers to infection transmission through person-to-person body contact, such as handshaking. Indirect contact route is also called fomite route, referring to infection transmission by touching objects or surfaces that have earlier been contaminated by hands or by direct deposition of infectious pathogens from the infected individuals. Direct and indirect contact routes are hard to distinguish since hands could be contaminated via both routes, and the virus concentration on susceptible individuals' hands sequentially influenced the exposure level.

For droplets with a radius of less than 5 \ud707\ud45a, the time from exhalation to evaporation to droplet nuclei is less than 0.1 s(Xie et al., 2006).

To our best knowledge, a dose-response relationship for both SARS-CoV-2 ancestral and Omicron variant as a cause of COVID-19 has not been reported. So in this study, we simply assumed that the dose-response rates for ancestral and Omicron variant were the same. Animal experiment suggested that airborne transmission was more efficient than fomite transmission. And recent findings on SARS-CoV-2 also revealed that the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, which was used to infect humans, was expressed at high levels in nose and low levels in the lower respiratory tract (approximately 4:1)(Hou et al., 2020). Thus, there is \ud702 \u2265 \ud702 . In this study, we suppose that \ud702 : \ud702 : \ud702 = 100: 1: 1 (Mizukoshi et al., 2021), though the 100:1 for infectivity in lower respiratory tract and upper respiratory tract/mucous membranes may be an overestimate, we set 100: 1 ratio mainly based on the data on influenza virus in humans, that for influenza, there is \ud702 : \ud702 = 1000: 1(Couch and Kasel, 1983;Nicas and Jones, 2009).

During symptomatic infection, for the susceptible child, the overall infection risk was 2.3\u00d7 10 -4 for virus concentration in saliva of 10 4 /mL, 2.3\u00d710 -2 for virus concentration in saliva of 10 6 /mL, and 0.90 for virus concentration in saliva of 10 8 /mL.

In the scientific and effective control of human-tohuman transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the relative importance of the pathways of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 have to be quantified, to determine the effective nonpharmaceutical interventions. In this study, based on the current knowledge about SARS-CoV-2 and its related information, we calculated the infection risk of SARS-CoV-2 from multiple pathways of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 in household settings and estimated the relative contribution of each pathway. We found that the relative importance of different routes during pre-/asymptomatic infection and symptomatic infection varied. In pre-/asymptomatic infection, all three routes contributed a role. In symptomatic infection, droplet route was the dominant pathway (48%-71%) and airborne route played a negligible role (contribution<10%). The main reason is that during pre-/asymptomatic infection, SARS-CoV-2 was mainly emitted via breathing and talking, and most droplets emitted from breathing were respirable droplets with diameter less than 10 microns. When the infector developed symptom, most viruses were emitted from coughing, since the volume of saliva from coughing was much larger than the volume of saliva from breathing and breathing. And droplets from coughing had relative larger size, so most exhaled droplets would deposit on environmental surfaces and inhale by susceptible individuals via droplet route. Concerned about the increase in the proportion of pre-/asymptomatic infections in Omicron strain (Garrett et al., 2022), the study of relative importance different routes in pre-/asymptomatic infection is very significant for SARS-CoV-2 prevention. In addition, for both pre-/asymptomatic and symptomatic infections, though SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant was more stable on various environmental surfaces than ancestral strain, the contribution of contact route in SARS-CoV-2 transmission increased slightly for Omicron variant. Previous studies had explored the relative contributions of different routes in SARS-CoV-2 ancestral variant transmission, via both animal model (Bao et al., 2020) and All rights reserved.

When the infection risk by contact route was high, with further quick increase of virus concentration in saliva, the infection risk by contact route would increase slowly, while infection risk via other route would still increase quickly, thus the contribution of contact route decreased. The relatively low overall infection risk in this study was mainly due to the relatively small volume of droplets exhaled by talking (0.16 VS 3.2\u00d7 10 mL saliva per 100 second speaking) and coughing (4.4\u00d7 10 VS 8.1\u00d7 10 mL per cough) in this study.

In the longterm care facilities with COVID-19 patients, the SARS-CoV-2 concentrations on environmental surfaces ranged from 1.3 to 3661.2 genomes/cm 2 , with median value at 76.6 genomes/cm 2 (Dumont-Leblond et al., 2021). The estimated virus concentration on environmental surfaces in this study was close to the results from field measurements. The transmission of SARS-CoV-2 Omicron via packaging had been attracted widespread attention. Due to the virus inactivation of Omicron variant is lower than ancestral strain (Chin et al., 2022), we are beginning to worry about whether the risk of contact transmission is significantly increased. Since both Omicron and ancestral variant survival well on environmental surfaces, and hand hygiene played a key role in contact transmission of SARS-CoV-2.",
