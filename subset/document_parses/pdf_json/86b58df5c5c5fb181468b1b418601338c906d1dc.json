However, early experience from frontline physicians observed that some patients developed unanticipated deterioration after having relatively stable periods, attesting to the uncertainty of clinical trajectories among hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Prediction tools that incorporate clinical variables at one time-point, usually on hospital presentation, are suboptimal for patients with dynamic changes and evolving clinical trajectories. Therefore, our study team developed a machinelearning algorithm to predict clinical deterioration among hospitalized COVID-19 patients by extracting clinically meaningful features from complex longitudinal laboratory and vital sign values during the early period of hospitalization with an emphasis on informative missing-ness. To incorporate the evolution of the disease and clinical practice over the course of the pandemic, we utilized a time-dependent cross-validation strategy for model development. Finally, we validated our prediction model on an external validation cohort of COVID-19 patients served in a demographically distinct population from the training cohort. The main finding of our study is the identification of risk profiles of early, late and no clinical deterioration during the course of hospitalization. While risk prediction models that include simple predictors at ED presentation and clinical judgement are able to identify any deterioration vs. no deterioration, our methodology is able to isolate a particular risk group that remain stable initially but deteriorate at a later stage of the course of hospitalization. We demonstrate the superior predictive performance with the utilization of laboratory and vital sign data during the early period of hospitalization compared to the utilization of data at presentation alone. Our results will allow efficient hospital resource allocation and will motivate research in understanding the late deterioration risk group.",

Prognostic models that do consider longitudinal clinical trajectories often do so by reducing the longitudinal information into discrete instances e.g., few recorded values [10] or minimum/maximum value prior to prediction [21] or by over-simplifying the information into a few summary measures like linear trends [8] . Moreover, these features are sensitive to missing data which are typically imputed with single or multiple imputations [10, 21] . Imputing missing data assumes the underlying missing data mechanism is missing completely at random (MCAR) or missing at random (MAR) and is arguably only reliable when the missing rate is 30% or less. Not only are missing rates amongst many clinical laboratory (lab) markers high (because lab tests are often only drawn when necessitated), but by extension MCAR and MAR assumptions are violated because missingness is informative of clinical course. In this paper, we develop novel features from complex longitudinal clinical trajectories that account for informative missingness and also preserve clinical meaningfulness.",

In their early experience, frontline physicians observed that some patients developed unanticipated deterioration after having relatively stable periods, attesting to the uncertainty of clinical trajectories among hospitalized patients with COVID-19 [19, 23] . Therefore, we develop prognostic tools operationalizing outcome as a time to event, or survival outcome, in order to distinguish stable patients who do not need ventilation from patients who might deteriorate at a later stage in their hospital course and from patients who deteriorate early in the hospital course.

The methodology of feature extraction from longitudinal laboratory values and vital signs is innovative in the following ways: 1) taking into account informative missingness of features extracted from longitudinal records (recorded with different frequency and time period for each patient); 2) eliminates the need to delete or impute informative missing records in the calculation of linear trends of recorded values, their frequency, their variability and whether they belong within a clinically normal range; 3) non-linear trends of records are captured by constructing clusters of longitudinal trajectories that take into account informative missingness and the fact that records are captured over different time-periods and frequency for each patient; and finally, 4) all defined features are simple, categorical and clinically interpretable. In order to account for timing of deterioration, we modelled deterioration as a survival outcome, or time to event outcome, in which time to event represented time to intubation/death. A key feature of a prognostic model is the definition of the index time at which the predictive model is supposed be applied in clinical practice. The index time determines which patients are included in the model because predictors are recorded prior to the index time and outcome necessarily occurs after the index time. In this paper, we considered 1) an early index time (i.e., 24 h since hospitalization) that has the advantage of predicting clinical deterioration early on in the course of hospitalization and 2) an index time during any point during the hospitalization (e.g. a randomly selected time-point) that ensures more accuracy due to the longer period of observation. Both definitions of index time have the potential to inform efficient hospital resource allocation by predicting time of clinical deterioration. Further, to incorporate the evolution of clinical practice over the course of the pandemic, we utilized a time-dependent cross-validation strategy for model development. Finally, we validated our final prediction model on an external cohort of COVID-19 patients being served in a different hospital in NYC from the training cohort.",

The longitudinal trajectories of lab and vital signs are likely to represent the complexities of a patient's response to the disease and its treatment in the hospital. Therefore, it is necessary to extract meaningful and informative information from the labs and vital signs. Existing methods for extracting features from longitudinal measurements of lab values and vital signs are often limited to simple linear trends that are sensitive to missing data or utilize the first or last available values which ignore the time point at which they are measured [10, 21] . We present a methodology to extract features from longitudinal trajectories of lab values and vital signs that is novel in the way it captures both linear and non-linear trends and in the way these trends take into account an informative missing data mechanism. Missing EMR data is typically imputed either by single or multiple imputation methods [2, 5, 25] that assume the underlying missing data mechanism to be missing at random. Moreover, missing values should not be imputed when the missing rate is >30%, which is often the case for certain labs. While utilizing feature extraction algorithms (e.g. neural networks) can result in superior predictive performance, they have limited clinical relevance. Our feature extraction method retains the clinical relevance and interpretability of the features.",

Therefore, the mechanism of missingness of labs is likely informative or missing not at random. Out of 38 measurements (32 labs and 6 vital signs), 9 (23.7%) measurements had a >50% missing rate, which makes imputing missing values inappropriate. To capture the informative missingness, a missing indicator of lab values was included as a feature. The same definition of missing indicator was used for both 24-hour and random index time.

In the presence of missing values, traditional trend features would delete otherwise usable lab markers that have a high degree of missingness. We used a novel principle of defining trend features so that missing values are handled without deleting observations; i.e. we coded missing values as 'zero' in a derived feature such that the non-missing 'zero' of the derived feature and the missing value code 'zero' reflect similar information. The trend features were defined as correlations with time so that they remain unit-free and allows us to avoid the exclusion of missing data. The correlation coefficient was further discretized to three levels (\u2212 1, 0, +1); a strong positive correlation between +0.3 and +1 was coded as +1, a strong negative correlation between \u2212 1 and \u2212 0.3 was coded as \u2212 1, and a weak/no correlation between \u2212 0.3 an d 0.3 was coded as 0.

Specifically, the trend in daily frequency by which a certain lab is ordered, or the trend in daily variability of a lab marker or vital sign, or the trend in frequency by which a lab marker or vital sign is above or below the normal range, lend insights into clinical deterioration. For that reason, we defined trend by calculating the correlation coefficient with time, in the manner described above, of the following features: 1) originally recorded values, 2) number of values recorded per calendar day, 3) variance of values recorded within a calendar day, and 4) (lower/upper) abnormal values. The second and third sets were calculated to monitor the change in daily frequency and variability of lab values. A strong positive trend in daily frequency and variability may imply clinical deterioration while a strong negative trend may indicate improvement or stabilization of the condition therefore requiring less clinical attention. Vital signs were excluded for these two sets because the frequency and variability of automatic extraction of vital signs are not informative. Due to small number of calendar days from ED presentation to 24-hour post hospitalization, these two sets were calculated only for random index time. Using the principle of defining unit-free features in order avoid exclusion of missing data, lab values or vital signs outside their clinical normal range were labeled as lower-or upper-abnormal and the trend of the occurrence of each was tracked over time. Lower-and upper-abnormalities were considered separately due to their different clinical implication. A strong positive trend indicates a deteriorating condition in that labs or vitals are more likely to be outside their clinical normal range over time. Meanwhile, a strong negative trend indicates a clinical improvement with less chance of lower-or upper-abnormality in labs and vitals. As noted before, a missing lab value will be coded as a 'zero' trend in their lower-or upper-abnormal equating them to consistent normal lab values. ",

Meanwhile, the random index time analysis of vital signs involved aligning temporal sequences of vital signs because each patient has a different length and frequency of recorded vital signs. We assumed that patients may exhibit a similar pattern of vital signs over time but the timing of certain state of vital signs may be different. DTW takes two sets of longitudinal data with different lengths and calculates the distance required for obtaining the optimal match of each. We implemented DTW with a constraint that the first [last] record of the one longitudinal data is matched with the first [last] record of the other longitudinal data. Pairwise distance between temporal sequences of vital signs via DTW was then calculated and clusters were determined using hierarchical clustering [13] .

The predictive performance of the multiple model scenarios presented in Table 3 suggests that predictors restricted to those at ED presentation show weak predictive performance of the outcome at 12, 24 and 48 h from the index time. Use of longitudinal features for the 24 h and random index time improves predictive performance substantially especially for the risk of intubation/death evaluated at 12 h and 24 h post-index time. The ability of all models to predict the outcome at 48 h post-index time is lower than that at 12 and 24 h post index time.

Our features are defined simply and categorically so that they retain clinical interpretation while capturing subtle nuances of inhospital clinical trajectories. Specifically, we conceptualized three sets of features for lab values and vital signs -linear trends, missing value indicators and clusters of trajectories (non-linear trends) and found that trajectory clusters provide the highest gain in predictive performance followed by missing indicators and trend features. We also found superior predictive performance of random survival forests with the utilization of lab and vital sign data during the early period of hospitalization compared to the utilization of data at ED presentation alone.

The ability to predict in-hospital clinical deterioration from the early period of hospitalization would allow efficient hospital resource allocation (e.g. ICU beds, ventilators, staffing) as well as inform early clinical interventions, such as transfer decisions in healthcare settings without intensive care capabilities. Thus, the major strength of our study is the development of an informatics tool that extracts clinically meaningful features from the complex longitudinal information of a patient's clinical course in order to accurately predict late deterioration of hospitalized COVID + patients. Such a set of standardized features defined in this way is useful in a variety of operational and research endeavors beyond that observed for deterioration of COVID + patients that require predictive modeling using Electronic Medical Records (EMR).",

For example, within the NYP hospital system in March 2020 there was no default ED lab order set for suspected COVID-19 patients; however, in early April as clinical experience matured a COVID-19 clinical order set was implemented with incomplete penetrance. In this case, the presence of lab values in the EMR from an ED admission could reflect clinical necessity or more simply the date of ED admission. As another example, care teams had to don PPE when in close contact with COVID-19 patients, reducing the frequency of lab studies performed in order to preserve PPE supply and mitigate the spread of infection. These circumstances inflated the frequency of lab values for patients with suspected deterioration compared to patients with suspected stability. These examples illustrate the complexities in the utilization of EMR data to predict clinical deterioration. To this end, our pipeline of extracting predictors from the EMR with a particular focus on informative missingness is essential in reducing selection bias in prognostic model development and ensures higher accuracy and greater generalizability.",

Hospitals responded to a saturation of intensive care resources with the conversion of alternative spaces to ICUs, redeployment of clinical staff to unfamiliar environments and the rapid development and dissemination of management protocols of a novel disease.

While we have demonstrated the need and advantage of including longitudinal clinical trajectories to predict late deterioration, such predictions cannot be obtained with a simple risk calculator that requires as input only a few easily available risk factors by the bedside; rather the predictive model has to be embedded within the EMR system with an automated feature extraction tool. Such implementation would have to overcome challenges of big data management platforms that include but are not limited to existence of multiple data standards, structures, types and format; rapid growth in data necessitating re-training the model on a periodic basis as new variants of the virus emerge; unavailability of open-source tools (such as R) to execute the predictive models and high costs. Although it is feasible to overcome these barriers, implementing our risk prediction model in the EMR system has additional challenges due to complexities of feature extraction. For that reason, we prioritized a feature extraction pipeline that is easy to implement in code, has clinical interpretation and does not need computation intensive imputation strategies to handle missing data. An exception to this principle are the clusters of lab and vital trajectories, which can be computationally intensive to implement in real-time. A solution to this computational burden would be to define these trajectories once sufficient data is collected and assign a new patient to one of these clusters based on the distance of the new patient's trajectory to the average trajectory of a cluster. Moreover, additional research is needed in order isolate currently unidentified clinical characteristics that predict late deterioration and that could be used for simplified risk prediction tools used for clinical care.",

Alert fatigue [1] is a wellrecognized, but unintended consequence of decision support where accuracy and actionability are poor. As ML algorithms are trained to optimize accuracy, they need to be made sensitive to clinician behavior by explicitly adding additional optimization criteria. Even if such shortterm issues are overcome, there could be additional medium and longerterm issues with implementation such as automation bias and reinforcement of outmoded practice [9] . Specifically, clinicians may become complacent about the monitoring of a patient classified in the \"no deterioration\" group (automation bias) although a few in that group may still deteriorate. This issue is compounded for a black-box model. On the other hand, as members of the \"late deterioration\" group are successfully identified and intervened on, the models would need to be retrained to avoid the risk of reinforcing outmoded practice [9] . Retraining the models would need the costly endeavor of a continuously learning system which would reinforce a feedback loop between prognosis and practice could result in self-fulfilling predictions. Such challenges and barriers of implementing a predictive model is not particular to our case. The uniqueness of the pandemic where surge in cases created inpatient bed capacity issues, we believe our predictive model is still useful in making critical triage decision for patient disposition.",
