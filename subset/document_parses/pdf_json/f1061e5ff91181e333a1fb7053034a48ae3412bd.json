This pilot study aimed to evaluate an online training program to increasegenetic literacy and communication skills in Australian oncology healthcare professionals tasked with discussing and coordinating mainstream genetic testing with breast and ovarian cancer patients. A training website with embedded videos was developed. This study assesses the website's acceptability and user-friendliness; suggestions for improvement were also elicited. Oncology healthcare professionals were recruited through relevant professional organisations, invited to the study by email, asked to work through the website and then complete an online questionnaire. Thirty-two oncology healthcare professionals completed the questionnaire after viewing the website. Nearly all participants were satisfied with the information contained in the program (very satisfied: n = 14/32, 44%, satisfied: n = 17/32, 53%, neither satisfied nor dissatisfied: n = 1/32, 3%) and reported that they had gained new skills (n = 29/32, 91%) and had increased confidence (n = 29/31, 94%) in communicating with breast and ovarian cancer patients about genetic testing. More than 93% (28/30) of participants endorsed the online program as clearly presented, informative, relevant and useful. This pilot study demonstrated high feasibility and acceptability of the training program to increase genetic literacy and communication skills in oncology healthcare professionals discussing genetic testing with breast and ovarian cancer patients. Further evidence from a randomised trial is needed to evaluate effects on changing clinical practice, improving patient outcomes, and cost-effectiveness.",

            "text": "Several factors have prompted the adoption of a mainstreaming model of genetic testing. Australian [9] and international guidelines [10] on germline BRCA1/2 genetic testing have expanded to include other indications in addition to the classic feature of a strong family history [11, 12] , increasing the number of women for whom genetic testing is recommended. These additional indicators include younger age at breast cancer diagnosis, presence of bilateral breast cancer, membership in an ethnic group with a high incidence of founder mutations (for example, Ashkenazi Jewish background), as well as tumour tissue characteristics, in particular triple negative breast cancer (estrogen and progesterone receptor and HER2 negative) [11, 12] . Second, the availability of targeted treatment, poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor, for platinum-sensitive BRCA -mutated high-grade epithelial ovarian cancer patients [13] means that it is more time-efficient for oncology specialists to request these tests without needing to refer the patient to a specialised genetics clinic. BRCA1/2 testing may also be of assistance in planning surgical therapy for women with breast cancer, whilst receiving neoadjuvant systemic therapy [14] . The falling costs of all types of genetic tests [15] have also contributed to the rapidly increasing number of tests ordered. Finally, in Australia one driver of a shift towards mainstreaming is the recent provision of government (Medicare) funding for germline testing of breast and ovarian cancer predisposition genes, which may be requested by a non-genetics specialist [13, 16] .",

As such, most people want testing. In our previous studies in both the breast cancer and ovarian cancer setting, we demonstrated that women unanimously commented that the decision to undergo testing was a \"no-brainer\" [26] [27] [28] [29] . As such, the communication skills required in the context of mainstream testing need to predominately focus on conveying genetic testing results to patients, in contrast to the communication skills required in relation to traditional genetic testing, which encompass tailored counselling to promote informed and shared decision-making regarding whether to have or postpone testing.",

Given the rapidly increasing number of genetic tests being offered by oncology healthcare professionals, there is an urgent need for the genetic literacy and communication skills of these professionals to be enhanced to ensure optimal translation of genetic research findings into mainstream healthcare [22, 30, 31] . A meta-analysis [32] and other reviews [33, 34] of online training interventions for specialists conclude that such interventions are educationally beneficial and can achieve outcomes similar to those of traditional teaching methods, with studies favouring online instructions compared to traditional methods [32] .

These results indicate that a whole suite of training interventions may be needed to meet oncology healthcare professionals' current needs to cover the increased range of germline testing in different cancers where testing is already being offered. Indeed, when this training website was first developed, the intention was to be able to modify it and add more modules to it, as more cancers could be tested under the Medicare Benefits Scheme in the future, e.g. colorectal cancers. A web portal with a wide range of different modules for users to choose from may be ideally suited to meet healthcare professionals' needs. A core module with generic content might be presented, together with specific modules that address diseasespecific issues. This approach has been shown to work well in other contexts [41] . The current website and its evaluation will provide some guidance as to the possible contents of individual modules comprising such web portals. Other suggestions for improvements made by participants included emailing updates to the program to people who have completed the program to allow them to keep their knowledge current. Other options for updating may include regular webinars, where those who have previously completed the training program are invited.",

The videos featured experts in cancer genetics, rather than professional actors, reflecting the low budget we had available. It is possible that more sophisticated videos, e.g. professionally produced videos featuring actors to play the role of patients and healthcare professionals to engage users in experiential learning activities, might have resulted in higher participant satisfaction. We have recently demonstrated that an online training website with video-based patient vignettes using professional actors can be used successfully to show exemplary clinician behaviours in the context of communication skills training in oncology [38] . Similar videos could be produced for training in cancer genetics, and such videos could be adapted for use in \"live\" webinars and training with actors. The recent Australian survey of medical specialists regarding their continuing education needs relating to genomic medicine shows that participants believed that experiential learning in genomic medicine was necessary to develop the confidence and skills needed for clinical care [22] . Hence, an important aim of future research should be to develop communication skills training programs specific to cancer genetics incorporating experiential learning activities. Such learning activities could incorporate watching videos and practicing with peers. Studies using similar experiential learning have demonstrated that communication skills training of oncologists increases the number of observable communication skills utilised by specialists in both simulated and actual consultations following training [44, 45] .",

First, it is unknown how many participants received the invitation to the study, and therefore it is not possible to report the response rate and assess participation bias. Oncology healthcare professionals were asked whether they had gained new skills from the program; however, this question should have been asked differently given they have not yet had an opportunity to use these new skills in practice. A follow-up assessment (e.g. six months after completion of the modules) would have been helpful to assess whether there was a gain in skills. Participants were asked to self-rate competence, and we did not objectively measure competence. Future studies should record consultations involving patients to demonstrate actual increases in the quality of communication and include direct assessments of patient outcomes as well as measurements against published competencies [46] . Another limitation was that the modules were restricted to genetic testing in the BRCA1/2 genes and did not include testing of other breast and ovarian cancer genes. Given the promising results from this pilot study, future studies should include randomised trials to evaluate whether the program changes clinical practice and improves patient outcomes. Future studies should also assess whether the online program actually leads to an increase in the use of genetic testing. Moreover, future studies should compare the effects of online training to blended models that combine some faceto-face with online learning.",
