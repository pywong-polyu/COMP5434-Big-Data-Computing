The lockdown has decreased microbial populations and heavy metals. Fe, Cu, Cd, Ni, Pb and Cr exceeded the drinking water limits, respectively, in 77%, 45%, 27%, 18%, 9% and 91% of the prelockdown samples. During the lockdown period, Fe, Cu and Cd concentrations in 23% and Cr in 50% of the samples exceeded the limits. Heavy Metal Pollution Index (PI) expressed that 27%, 64% and 9% of the prelockdown samples represented 'low', 'medium' and 'high' pollution categories, respectively, but 68% and 32% of the lockdown period samples represented 'low' and 'medium' categories, respectively. The Metal Index (MI) exposed that all samples of pre-lockdown were under the seriously affected category, whereas 54% and 46% of lockdown samples were under strongly and seriously affected categories, respectively. Health risk evaluation predicted that 95%, 91% and 86% of pre-lockdown samples and 45%, 36% and 33% of lockdown period samples were at risk among children, teenagers and adults, respectively. As there is no integrated study on river water quality of COVID-19 lockdown this work is uniquely carried out by combining heavy metal pollution, microbial contamination and human health risk evaluation.",

Aquatic contamination by heavy metals is a vital challenge because of their hazardous effects and accretion in aquatic environments (Tscheikner-Gratl et al., 2019) . The toxicity of heavy metals in water is associated with human health (Li et al., 2014) . Many studies have characterized the heavy metals contamination in drinking water (Wagh et al., 2018; Prasanna et al., 2012; Edet and Offiong, 2002) .",

Kundu (2020) has reported that water pollution was minimized in the many countries such as Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand, Bangladesh and Maldives due to COVID-19 lockdown. Cripps (2020) has stated that prohibition for public gatherings and restriction for tourism have played vital roles in reduction of pollution levels. In India, industries were closed due to COVID-19 because the focus was on containing the spread via quarantines and national lockdowns (Hamzelou, 2020) . The Indian government announced lockdown throughout the country in four phases from 24 th March to 31 st May 2020, and industries were allowed to open from 1 st June 2020. In addition to this, colleges, schools, malls, public transports, markets, and hotels were closed during the lockdown period. Many researchers have analyzed the gaseous pollutants in the atmosphere before and after the COVID-19 lockdown periods (Manikanda Bharath et al., 2020; Mahato et al., 2020; Selvam et al., 2020a,b) .

Dutta et al. (2020) have studied the quality of Ganga River water by assessing dissolved oxygen (DO), biological oxygen demand (BOD), chemical oxygen demand (COD), nitrate, faecal coliform and total coliform. They have observed increasing trend of DO and decreasing trend of BOD, nitrate, faecal coliform and total coliform during the lockdown period. Based on this assessment they concluded that significant improvement of water quality had occurred due to the lockdown leading the water fit for drinking (Class A) in the upper segments and for outdoor bathing (Class B) in the middle and lower segments. Mukherjee et al. (2020) have also observed the sudden dropdown in the coliform bacterial load in the river Ganges due to lockdown. Shukla et al. (2021) have also pointed out that around 50% of dissolved heavy metal concentrations were decreased in the River Ganga in a few months of lockdown due to reduction in industrial waste water discharge. Similar results were got in the other rivers such as Beas, Svarnarekha, Chambal, and Sutlej (DTE, 2020). Aman et al. (2020) have identified the decreased turbidity levels based on suspended particulate matter (SPM) in the Sabarmati River using remote sensing techniques. Arif et al. (2020) have observed the reduction of BOD and COD in the Yamuna River during the lockdown period. However, Khan et al. (2021) have reported that there is no significant improvement in the water quality of Gomti River based on DO and BOD levels due to the stoppage of sewage treatment plants and disposal of untreated sewage during the lockdown. Though there are some recent studies in which the effect of COVID-19 lockdown on water quality and heavy metals have been reported (Chakraborty et al., 2021 , Bar, 2020 Patel et al., 2020; Yunus et al., 2020; Selvam et al., 2020b) , no study with simultaneous microbiological and inorganic pollutant load (heavy metals) coupled with human health risk evaluation was attempted. Comparative study of COVID-19 lockdown effects on water quality in various parts of the India are summarized in Table S1 . Particularly in the state of Tamil Nadu, no such integrated studies to assess the overall river water quality and the associated health risks were conducted. Therefore, we studied the microbiological and heavy metals contamination levels in a part of Thirumanimuthar River (South India) by analyzing the samples collected before and during the lockdown periods. Heavy Metal Pollution Index (HPI) and Metal Index (MI) were computed for eight metals to assess the status of contamination. Further, human health risks were also evaluated based on the heavy metals concentration in water for three age categories such as children, teenagers and adults, and multivariate statistical techniques were used to identify the probable sources of heavy metals in the study region.",

The pre-lockdown samples represent post-monsoon (winter) season, and the lockdown period samples represent pre-monsoon (summer) season. In a regular interval river water samples were collected from geotagged sampling locations ( Fig. 1) at middle of the major flow from a depth of 0-5 cm. There was no rain during the collection of samples because the study area receives majority of rainfall during monsoon season, which is from June to December. The collected water samples were stored in 1000 ml pre-cleaned Teflon bottles. One portion of the sample was acidified with concentrated nitric acid below pH 2.0 to minimize absorption and precipitation of metals. Another portion of the water sample was not acidified. The water samples were examined for Cr, Pb, Mn, Fe and Ni using Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer (AAS) (PerkinElmer Analyst 700). The AAS is one of the significant technique for measuring amounts of chemical elements in water samples by the calculation of absorbed radiation through the presence of chemical of interest. The standards used for all the metals were 0.01, 0.02, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2 and 0.5 mg L \u2212 1 . The standards were run after every three samples for precision and accuracy.",

After the announcement of lockdown, the migrant workers and the students stayed in hostels left the Salem city immediately. Since the lockdown period falls in the summer season the increased temperature might have reduced the microbial concentration in the river water (Ferreira and Chauvet, 2011) . Further, usage of more alcoholic disinfectants and sanitizers for hand washing, dish washing, cloth washing and bathing by the inhabitants as per the direction the government to control COVID-19 spread might have reduced the microbes in the waste water. Dutta et al. (2020) and Mukherjee et al. (2020) have reported that shutdown of industries and commercial activities, non-appearance of bathing, and banning of religious activities during COVID-19 lockdown have drastically decreased BOD, faecal coliform and total coliform population in the Ganga River (India). In the Godavari and Krishna Rivers (India) decreased biological parameters were reported by the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (2021) during the COVID-19 lockdown period. Particularly in the Krishna River, about 40% decrease in fecal coliforms was reported by MPCB. The enhancement of the river water quality in Rishikesh and Haridwar was observed by Singhal and Matto (2020) due to immediate drop of the visitors and 50% decrease of industrial and sewage waste disposal.",

In this study, only two samples of pre-lockdown were above the permissible limit (0.01 mg L \u2212 1 ), but all the samples were within the permissible limit during the COVID-19 period. A higher concentration of Pb in surface water was due to the discharge of wastes from industries and sewage disposal. Boateng et al. (2019) suggested that the source of Pb mainly originates from house sewers, paints, old plumbing, animal and human excretion, disposal of lead batteries, and agricultural runoff including phosphate fertilizers. Raised Pb levels in the human body will cause central nerve death and brain damage (Punitha and Selvarajan, 2018) . Other health issues such as hearing loss, high blood pressure, kidney problems and muscle and joint pains will also happen (Sekar and Suriyakala, 2016) . Before lockdown, the average chromium (Cr) concentration in the Thirumanimuthar River samples was 0.327 mg L \u2212 1 , but it is reduced to 0.108 mg L \u2212 1 during the lockdown.

The major sources of Cr in water are effluents discharged from tanning, refractory, pigment production, and electroplating industries (Danil de Namor et al., 2012) .

A significant positive correlation among these metals indicates that sources are from the same origin (Cengiz et al., 2017) .

In the Thirumanimuthar River, HPI values varied from 54 to188 before lockdown and 47-137 during the COVID-19 lockdown period. Before lockdown, six samples were classified under the low category, 14 under the medium category, and 2 under the high category. During COVID-19 lockdown, 15 samples were under the low (safe) category and 7 were under the medium category. This improvement in water quality was mainly due to the closure of all the industries during the lockdown. The spatial distribution of various HPI categories in the Thirumanimuthar River course is displayed in Fig. 3a and 3b , respectively, for pre-and lockdown periods.",

In this analysis, Euclidean distance is chosen to combine the parameters with respect to the degree of similarity. It will be delivered by tree diagram showing distance, connection and differences among the groups. This diagram shows an extreme uniformity among the clusters and great diversity between the groups (Fatoba et al., 2017) . Various researchers have conducted cluster analysis in different regions for water quality studies (Panda et al., 2020; Aravinthasamy et al., 2019; Isa et al., 2017; Muhammad et al., 2016) . Before the COVID-19 lockdown, there were four clusters of heavy metals. Zn, Ni, Cu, and Pb contributed towards Cluster 1, whereas Cluster 2 was formed by Cr and Cd. Cluster 3 and Cluster 4 were contributed by Mn and Fe (Fig. 4a, b) . The major cluster was contributed by Fe, Cu before COVID-19 lockdown. The major four clusters of pre-lockdown samples suggest that the heavy metal contamination was from the industries. During COVID-19 lockdown, all the samples fall in the sub-clusters indicating the contamination of surface water with heavy metals was decreased in this river. The cluster analysis of microbial parameters indicated one major cluster and two sub clusters in the pre-lockdown samples. E. coli and fecal Streptococci have clustered in cluster-3 and total coliform and fecal coliform fall in cluster-1 and cluster-2 (Fig. 5a) . During the COVID-19 lockdown period (Fig. 5b) three clusters have decreased. This is due to shutdown of different small and large industrial sectors, closure of hotels, and restricted traffic movements and business activities. Seasonal variation also played role for the declination of microbial parameters in the river.",

Karunanidhi et al., (2021) have reported the effect of monsoon and COVID-19 lockdown on shallow groundwater quality by determining major ions and fluoride. They have computed health risk for human beings due to fluoride contamination in groundwater and not for heavy metals. Therefore, in this study, we used the hazard index (HI) to show the total potential human health risks from various heavy metals, which is based on hazard quotients (HQ) from oral pathways. The non-carcinogenic risk was evaluated for five important hazardous heavy metals such as Mn, Ni, Cr, Fe and Pb. The results obtained for children, teenagers and adults were depicted in Table 3 . The HQ among children for pre-lockdown period ranged from 0.003 to 0.0089, 0. 076-0.235, 0.005-0.063, 0.498-14.793 and 0.000-0.433 for Fe, Mn, Ni, Cr and Pb, respectively. However, the mean HQ for these metals were 00.032, 0.141, 0.030, 5.087, and 0.130, respectively. In the pre-lockdown samples, the HQ values among teenagers for Fe, Mn, Ni, Cr and Pb ranged from 0.003 to 0. 073, 0.062-0.193, 0.004-0.056, 0.409-12.159 and 0.000-0.384, respectively. In the pre-lockdown samples, the HQ for adults varied from 0.002 to 0.062, 0. 053-0.166, 0.003-0.044, 0.350-10.416, and 0.023-0.329 for Fe, Mn, Ni, Cr and Pb, respectively. The non-carcinogenic risks based on HI total were calculated for these metals using RfD values. The HI total computed from the prelockdown samples varied from 0.661 to 15.250, 0.680-12.534, 0.582-10.737 among children, teens and adults, respectively.",

The outcome of this work revealed that heavy metals concentration was drastically reduced in the Thirumanimuthar River water within a short period due to the closure of industries. Hence, the administrators should strictly implement the pollution control policies to avoid surface water contamination by hazardous metals. Among the eight metals examined, Cr pollution is alarming in the study region. Therefore, zero liquid discharge (ZLD) must be implemented in all the leather tanning and dye industries to minimize heavy metals pollution.",

Part of Salem city alone is getting drinking water supply from Cauvery River but the other parts are not receiving the pretreated water. Most of the inhabitants in towns and villages are using river water and groundwater for their drinking and domestic needs. Very few people have fixed reverse osmosis (RO) units in their houses to filter the water. In villages and towns where planned waste handling and disposal and waste treatment such as incineration plants, wastewater treatment plants, etc., are not available, the innovative solutions will not be helpful. Therefore, in such scenarios public awareness will play a significant role than well developed technology. In addition, we recommend to use appropriate portable Reverse Osmosis Water Purification Unit (ROWPU) in houses for getting potable drinking water.",

            "text": "Even though many research studies have been conducted to examine the river/surface water quality by separately studying heavy metals contamination or DO, BOD and COD or microbial populations, no integrated study based on physico-chemical parameters, heavy metals and microbial levels was attempted for the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown. This research work is unique since integrated approach is used to evaluate the overall river water quality by assessing microbiological parameters along with Heavy Metal Pollution Index (HPI), Metal Index (MI), and Hierarchical Cluster Analysis (HCA). In addition, human health risk evaluation was performed for various age group of inhabitants such as children, teenagers and adults based on the oral intake of heavy metals in the Thirumanimuthar River water. The results of this study suggest that the river is contaminated from industrial, agricultural, and municipal wastes. These results are supported with a decrease in the microbiological population and heavy metals concentration during the COVID-19 lockdown period. The rainfall occurrence may naturally dilute the concentration of heavy metals in river water. Since the study period falls in summer season, and there is no dilution effect due to rain the reduction in pollution level is mainly due to closure of industries during lockdown. Among all the heavy metals analyzed in this study, the maximum decrease was for Cr concentration due to lockdown. The concentration of heavy metals in the pre-COVID-19 lockdown samples was in the order: Cd>Pb>Ni>Cu>Mn>Zn >Cr>Fe, and during COVID-19 lockdown period, it was Cd>Ni>Cu>Pb>Mn>Zn>Cr>Fe. In the prelockdown period, 77%, 45%, 27%, 18%, 9% and 91% of the samples exceeded the permissible limits for drinking for Fe, Cu, Cd, Ni, Pb and Cr, respectively, whereas, in the lockdown period, 23% of samples exceeded the permissible limits for Fe, Cu and Cd, and 50% of samples exceeded for Cr. The Heavy Metal Pollution Index (HPI) showed that 27%, 64% and 9% of the samples were classified under 'low/safe', 'medium' and 'high' pollution categories in the pre-lockdown period, respectively, but 68% and 32% of the samples of lockdown period were classified under 'low/safe' and 'medium' pollution categories, respectively. The Metal Index (MI) results revealed that all the samples (100%) of pre-lockdown were under seriously affected category (MI>6), whereas 54% and 46% of lockdown period samples represented strongly affected (MI = 4-6) and seriously affected categories, respectively. Health risk appraisal indicated that 95%, 91% and 86% of pre-lockdown samples, and 45%, 36% and 33% of lockdown period samples were under risk among children, teenagers and adults, respectively. If contamination of river water is regulated and sewage treatment plants (STPs) are used effectively, the river water can be used for agriculture and domestic purposes. ",
