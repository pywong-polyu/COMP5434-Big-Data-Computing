To quantify host quality, we use the concept of reproductive value, a key concept in demography and evolutionary biology [4, 5, 6]. Reproductive value measures how much a virus infecting a given class of hosts will contribute to the future of the viral population.

Susceptible hosts are initially naive (S L and S H ) but they can become vaccinated (\u015c L and\u015c H ) at rates \u03bd L and \u03bd H , respectively. When vaccinated, hosts have reduced transmissibility and infectivity, but vaccine escape can erode these benefits. We consider different viral strains characterised by an escape trait e which takes values between 0 (no escape) and 1 (full escape). The capacity of a variant to reduce the effect of the vaccine on transmissibility (resp. infectivity) is captured by a function E \u03c4 (e) (resp. E \u03c3 (e)), which allows us to quantify the overall ability of the virus to escape the protective effects of the vaccine as E(e) = E \u03c4 (e)E \u03c3 (e).",

This tells us that the intensity of selection depends on (i) the ability of the virus mutant to escape the protective effects of vaccine, (ii) the density of vaccinated hosts in the different types of hosts (L or H), and (iii) the relative number of contacts of each class of hosts. Note that the epidemiological impact of a higher contact rate (M > 1) translates into a magnified selective impact (M 2 ). Thus, if we have to chose between vaccinating L and H hosts, targeting H hosts is expected to select more strongly for the vaccine-escape mutant. Figure 1A confirms that this approximation captures very well the temporal dynamics of the vaccine-escape mutant and can be used to understand the evolutionary consequences of different targeted vaccination strategies. Of course, the choice of the vaccination strategy should not be based solely on the reduction of the speed of adaptation to vaccines. Indeed, the best way to limit the spread of vaccine-escape mutations would be to adopt the worst epidemiological strategy: avoiding to use vaccines. Yet, we urgently need vaccines to save lives and halt the current pandemic. Tracking the cumulative number of deaths after the start of vaccination roll out allows us to identify the consequences of distinct targeted vaccination strategies on mortality (see Methods). Figure 1A shows that targeting L hosts is expected to decrease mortality because we assume that L hosts (e.g. older individuals with less contacts) are also associated with higher risks of dying from the infection. Hence, targeting L hosts makes sense both for epidemiological and evolutionary reasons.",

Hence, the influence of an increase in the densities of hosts vaccinated by a single or two doses of vaccines are weighted by \u2206E I and \u2206E II , respectively. A single vaccine dose is likely to induce a lower protection against the virus (i.e. E I > E II ) but this does not necessarily imply that \u2206E I > \u2206E II . In fact, we can show that if the vaccine is acting on a single step of the virus' life cycle we expect \u2206E II > \u2206E I . Delaying the acquisition of the second dose will have two effects: (i) a lower density\u015c II of fully vaccinated hosts decreases the more intense selection imposed by these hosts, (ii) but delaying the second dose allows for more hosts to be vaccinated and to increase\u015c I and may thus increase selection for the vaccine-escape mutant. We show in Figure 1B that this second effect can be more important than the first one and delaying the second dose can result in faster adaptation. However, the mortality may be lower because a larger fraction of the population would benefit from the protection of the vaccine. Hence, in contrast to the previous scenario, the strategy that maximises the speed of adaptation may result in a lower mortality. A more comprehensive exploration of the robustness of these conclusions is needed before making specific recommendations on delaying the second dose. Yet, the contrast between our two scenarios illustrates the necessity to quantify both the epidemiological and the evolutionary consequences of different targeted vaccination strategies to identify the optimal way to distribute vaccines.",

The growing concern regarding the ability of the virus to escape host immunity calls for tools that may allow us to anticipate the speed of the spread of vaccine-escape mutants. We show here that heterogeneity in the behaviour (scenario 1) and/or immune status (scenario 2) can induce variation in the strength of selection for vaccine-escape mutations.

In contrast, we focus on between-host selection and ask whether vaccine-escape variants can increase in frequency at the population level. Indeed, within-host selection is likely to constrain the emergence of vaccine-escape mutations in the first place but we contend that once those vaccine-escape mutants reach a significant fraction of the population, the fate of those mutations will be driven by between-host selection. Our analysis shows that the speed of viral adaptation critically depends on the balance between the within-host effects (i.e. the relative magnitudes of \u2206E I and \u2206E II ) and the populationlevel effects (i.e. the relative densities of hosts with one or two doses of the vaccine). We show that a higher speed of adaptation may be the price to pay for a reduced number of deaths ( Figure 1B) . Indeed, delaying the second dose allows us to protect (albeit partially) a larger fraction of the population (see [1] for an exploration of this effect).

The rate of infection of naive hosts by the genotype i depends on the forces of infection due to naive (h i ) or vaccinated hosts (\u0125 i ) as detailed in the text. Vaccination reduces the force of infection and e i refers to the ability of the genotype i to escape the immunity triggered by vaccination (we assume e m > e w ). After infection, hosts can either die or recover, with probabilities c k i and\u0109 k i .",
