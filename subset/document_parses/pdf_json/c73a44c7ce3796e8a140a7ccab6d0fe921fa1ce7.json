This study was designed to investigate the role of M. pneumoniae infection in acute exacerbation of asthma in children. A total of 150 patients (110 males, 40 females) were studied and immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies to M. pneumoniae were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and PCR amplification was performed for the P1 gene to associate M. pneumoniae infection with asthma. As compared with 33 children with asthma, only two of the control subjects had positive IgM titers for M. pneumoniae, which was statistically significant (P = 0.002). A total of 15 children with asthma were positive by PCR for the P1 gene while none of the controls had a positive PCR. Of these positive cases, 24 cases were positive only by ELISA, six were positive only by PCR and nine patients were found to be positive by both ELISA and PCR. All the clinical characteristics of the patients at baseline were comparable between the moderate and the severe group of patients statistically, except for the peak expiratory flow rate. Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection was found to have a significant association with acute exacerbation in the moderate group of asthma patients by PCR (P = 0.01).

Several factors such as genetic, environmental, dietary change and occupational exposure are known to predispose to asthma (Kino & Oshima, 1989; Beckett, 1994; Homnick & Marks, 1998; Cengizlier & Misirlioglu, 2006; Maclennan et al., 2006) . Numerous viral infections trigger acute asthma exacerbations. Viral infections such as rhinovirus, coronavirus, influenza virus, adenovirus, parainfluenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus and human metapneumovirus have been found to be observed more often during severe exacerbations of asthma than during mild exacerbations (Johnston et al., 1995; Reed et al., 1997; Marin et al., 2000) . In addition to these, the role of Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection in the pathogenesis of asthma was speculated around 30 years ago (Berkovich et al., 1970) . Recently, the role of infectious agents, in particularly the atypical bacteria, Chlamydophila pneumoniae and M. pneumoniae, in asthma pathogenesis has become an active area of investigation. Chlamydophila pneumoniae and M. pneumoniae are the pathogens that primarily infect ciliated epithelial cells and alveolar macrophages (Grayston et al., 1990; Dallo & Baseman, 2000) . Considerable data exist implicating these organisms in the exacerbation of asthma (Huhti et al., 1974; Leaver & Weinberg, 1985; Seggev et al., 1986; Kondo et al., 1994) . Experimental infection of mice with M. pneumoniae induced inflammation and increased air resistance (Hardy et al., 2001) . These effects appear most clearly in mice previously sensitized to an allergen and subsequently infected with M. pneumoniae (Martin et al., 2001) . Even though the progression of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease has been correlated with persistent infection with M. pneumoniae based on seroprevalence studies in children with asthma (Freymuth et al., 1999; Lieberman et al., 2001) , the exact role and incidence of M. pneumoniae in acute asthma exacerbation in pediatric cases is still poorly understood. The clinical diagnosis of M. pneumoniae infection is frequently hindered by a lack of specific signs and symptoms, although in the majority of cases increasing cough, malaise, low-grade fever and headache have been reported. The lack of a gold standard for the diagnosis of this pathogen still hinders the current understanding of their true prevalence and role in the pathogenesis of acute and chronic respiratory infections. While molecular diagnostic techniques, such as PCR, offer improvements in sensitivity, specificity and rapidity over culture and serology, the need remains for a consistent and reproducible diagnostic technique, available to all microbiology laboratories.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 327, "end": 348, "text": "(Kino & Oshima, 1989;", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 349, "end": 363, "text": "Beckett, 1994;", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 364, "end": 386, "text": "Homnick & Marks, 1998;", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 387, "end": 418, "text": "Cengizlier & Misirlioglu, 2006;", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 419, "end": 442, "text": "Maclennan et al., 2006)", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 772, "end": 795, "text": "(Johnston et al., 1995;", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 796, "end": 814, "text": "Reed et al., 1997;", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 815, "end": 834, "text": "Marin et al., 2000)", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 968, "end": 992, "text": "(Berkovich et al., 1970)", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 1320, "end": 1343, "text": "(Grayston et al., 1990;", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 1344, "end": 1366, "text": "Dallo & Baseman, 2000)", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1451, "end": 1471, "text": "(Huhti et al., 1974;", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1472, "end": 1496, "text": "Leaver & Weinberg, 1985;", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 1497, "end": 1517, "text": "Seggev et al., 1986;", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 1518, "end": 1537, "text": "Kondo et al., 1994)", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 1640, "end": 1660, "text": "(Hardy et al., 2001)", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 1787, "end": 1808, "text": "(Martin et al., 2001)", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 2012, "end": 2035, "text": "(Freymuth et al., 1999;", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 2036, "end": 2059, "text": "Lieberman et al., 2001)", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "In India, as in other developing countries, acute respiratory tract infections are still one of the major causes of childhood morbidity and mortality.

This is because of the poor diagnosis of M. pneumoniae infection. Culture is the gold standard for the diagnosis of M. pneumoniae. However, it is a very fastidious and a slow-growing organism, and takes 2-4 weeks to isolate. In this study, we did not find any culture positivity. This may be due to many reasons. First, the culture depends on the prognosis of the disease. This may lead to differences in disease diagnosis, as we collected samples from patients who were previously diagnosed as having moderate or severe persistent asthma and were on a regular follow-up at the pediatric chest clinic. Second, the patients are also likely to have received antibiotic treatment due to clinical manifestations. Third, M. pneumoniae DNA usually remains detectable by PCR in throat swabs even after 1-2 weeks of infection, although the culture cannot be detected due to a decline in the bacterial load. PCR is the most sensitive test available for identifying microorganisms. Mycoplasma pneumoniae can be detected by PCR in airways even when cultures and serological results are negative. It may also indicate the presence of an organism in the respiratory tract in lieu of negative serology (Kraft et al., 2002) . Taking PCR as the gold standard, the sensitivity of ELISA was 60% (32.9, 82.5), the specificity was 82.2% (74.5, 88.1), the positive predictive value was 27.3% (13.9, 45.8) and the negative predictive value was 94.0% (88.7, 97.9). Therefore, both molecular and serologic diagnostic tests for M. pneumoniae infection with a clinical correlation can be used as a rapid marker to study its association with asthma.
