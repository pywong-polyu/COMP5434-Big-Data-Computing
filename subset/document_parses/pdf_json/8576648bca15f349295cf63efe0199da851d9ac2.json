Timely and effective transfusion of blood products is of critical in these scenarios. The frequency in which blood component products are transfused in surgical patients begs for a greater understanding of them. The aim of this chapter is to provide clinicians with a discussion of the current literature on the various blood component products, their indications, and unique hemostatic conditions in the surgical patient.
