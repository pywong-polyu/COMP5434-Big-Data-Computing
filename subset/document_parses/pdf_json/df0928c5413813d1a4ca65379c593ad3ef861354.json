However, due to similar imaging manifestations, they are often misdiagnosed as malignant tumors. Here, we report a case of a 43-year-old woman with fever and space-occupying liver disease. Liver biopsy, parasite-specific antibody screening, and stool testing did not find any pathogens. Therefore, metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) and routine microbiological examinations were performed. Finally, Fasciola hepatica was only identified by mNGS. The body temperature of the patient and the eosinophil count remained normal, and the space-occupying liver lesions were significantly absorbed after more than 7 months of treatment with albendazole. The details of this case highlight the timely use of mNGS to identify parasites and judge therapeutic effects after treatment, providing important help for clinical decision-making.",

            "text": "Fascioliasis hepatica is an infection caused by a trematode of the liver, Fasciola hepatica, that particularly affects sheep, goats, and cattle (1) . The distribution of humans infected with F. hepatica depends on the intermediate hosts. Due to the habitat requirements of the intermediate hosts, the distribution may be patchy (2, 3) . France, the United Kingdom, the former Soviet Union, Cuba, and other countries have reported numerous cases. However, the number of patients in China is less (3) , mainly scattered in the Liaoning, Jining, Heilongjiang, Jiangxi, Yunnan, Guangdong, and Guangxi provinces. More importantly, there are no cases reported in Chongqing until now. The incubation period and clinical manifestations of human fascioliasis are different and are divided into two stages. In the acute phase, the main manifestations are fever, anemia, hepatomegaly, and a significantly elevated blood eosinophils count (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) . While in the chronic phase, it manifests as jaundice, ascites, and even spreads to the extrahepatic organs through the bloodstream (8) (9) (10) (11) . The clinical outcomes of critically ill patients are always poor. So, the confirmation of the diagnosis is necessary. In nonendemic areas, diagnosis of fascioliasis hepatica can be difficult because the disease is not often encountered and the symptoms may be confused with other hepatic or biliary disorders, such as liver abscess, liver tuberculosis, and so on. Additionally, the radiological findings in F. hepatic infection may present with multiple nodular lesions, subcapsular low density, and solitary nodular lesions, etc. resulting in dilemma or confusion. Presently, metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) based on high-throughput sequencing has been widely used to screen for broad-spectrum pathogens, including Mycobacterium Tuberculosis, Toxoplasma gondii, and other atypical pathogens. Here, we report the first case of fascioliasis hepatica identified by mNGS in Chongqing, China.",

The highest body temperature appeared at night but returned to normal in the morning, with dry cough, shortness of breath, and dull pain in the liver area. The physical examination of the whole body showed no obvious positive signs, there were no abdominal tenderness and percussion pain, and no enlarged superficial lymph nodes were palpated. So, the patient still could live and work properly. She lived in Chongqing city, whose economic situation is medium as a furniture sales staff. She visited Guangzhou province 6 months ago on business for 2 days. She denied any contact with livestock and eating wild vegetables, raw fish, shrimp, and so on, but drank tap water every day. The local hospital prescribed empirical antimicrobial therapy with azithromycin and Chinese herbal medicines; however, the treatment failed to relieve the symptoms of the patient. Thus, the patient was transferred to our hospital for further evaluation. An outline of the episodes is described in Figure 1 . Chest CT scan showed no infection in the lungs, while mass-like shadows in the liver were observed on the abdominal CT scan. Routine blood parameters revealed elevated white blood cell and eosinophil count (Figure 2) .",

Microbial tests, including blood cultures, stool examination, and stool precipitation, did not detect any pathogens. Eggs were not detected by direct fecal smear and fecal washing precipitation. Due to excessive pharyngeal reflex during gastroduodenal tube placement, two attempts failed to obtain the bile of the patient. The diagnosis of tuberculosis was excluded for the negative results of the chest CT scan, tuberculin skin test, tuberculosis IgG and IgM antibody screening, and T-Spot examination. Meanwhile, ovarian tumors, liver tumors, gastrointestinal tumors, and hematological tumors were also excluded temporarily as the negative results of abdominal enhanced CT and tumor marker detection such as AFP, CA-50, CEA, TAP, CA-125, CA-199, CA-242, and CA-724 and so on. The serum parasite IgG antibody, including schistosome, paragonimiasis, cysticercosis, trichinella spiralis, liver fluke, sparganosis, and hydatid IgG antibody detected by ELISA were negative on hospital day 12.

(E) Abdominal MRI enhancement showed cystic and tubular shadows in the right lobe of the liver, with irregular shapes and edge enhancement in the enhanced part. Some lesions were smaller than before on follow-up day 137. (F) Abdominal MRI enhancement showed the right lobe of the liver scattered flakes, irregular shape, enhanced edge uneven enhancement, lesions significantly reduced on follow-up day 418. role in this case. Fascioliasis hepatica is often sporadic and has not been reported previously in Chongqing, China. The source of infection is contaminated water containing larva and aquatic plants and is easily ignored by clinicians in medical history collection. The diagnosis of fascioliasis hepatica may be difficult because of the lack of a clear epidemiological history, wide spectrum of differential diagnosis, and low incidence (3) . The abnormal laboratory and radiological findings in F. hepatica infection may represent hepatitis, liver abscess, malignancy, and infection with parasites such as Ascariasis and Clonorchis sinensis. More recently, triclabendazole is the drug of choice for its effectiveness against both adult and immature worms (7, 12, 13). As for albendazole, it is partially effective against fascioliasis hepatica. In this case, triclabendazole was not obtained for treatment due to the epidemic of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). After treatment with albendazole, the body temperature and eosinophil count of the patient decreased significantly. Albendazole is considered partially effective. In this particular case, both the MRI and CT of the upper abdomen showed abnormal uneven enhancement density shadows that are more likely to be considered as infectious lesions, but tumor lesions cannot be excluded. This may be related to the atypical imaging of fascioliasis hepatica. Such lesions pose a diagnostic dilemma or confusion between malignancy and infection (3). Also, there was no finding of parasites or eggs in the hepatic tissue, which was destroyed when making sliced specimens. Currently, diagnosis is confirmed only by demonstrating live parasites or eggs in the bile or feces, through Fecal Sedimentation, Modified Kato-Katz thick smear method, and Mercury-aldehyde iodine concentration method, but with a relatively low positive rate (4, 5) . An examination of the precipitation or centrifugation of the duodenal fluid has a relatively high positive rate (14). Also, demonstrating live parasites or eggs by laparotomy, laparoscopy biopsy, and other histopathologic examination is less used in the clinic for the larger trauma. However, there is no egg in the stool of the patient in the acute stage. The acute stage of fascioliasis hepatica begins with the slow migration of F. hepatica through the liver parenchyma; the mature flukes digest and consume hepatocytes, dig tunnels and caves, and reside in the liver for months, causing hepatitis, chills, fever, right upper abdominal pain, abdominal distension, and loss of appetite (4, 5, 7, 9, 15) . While in the chronic stage, the worm moves to the bile duct, and the inner wall is digested, causing bile duct dilatation, cholangitis, cholelithiasis, and liver pain, jaundice, and other discomforts (9) (10) (11) . But the clinical manifestations are atypical and difficult to diagnose. Therefore, it requires more diagnostic tools to assist in the diagnosis. In the acute stage, serum immunological examination, such as ELISA, indirect fluorescent antibody test (IFA), indirect hemagglutination test (IHA), and counter-current immuneelectrophoresis (CIE), can be used as identification tools (16) (17) (18) (19) . But the serological tests may have similar results with other schistosome infections. Therefore, it is crucial to find early etiological evidence.",

The suspected pathogen can be detected by the mNGS, through the flow of sequencing, data cleaning, error detection, and database comparative analysis. At present, mNGS has been widely used in clinics, including, respiratory tract infection (25), central nervous system infection (26) , joint infection (27, 28) , hepatic tuberculosis (29), etc. Metagenomic next-generation sequencing has many advantages in identifying hard-to-culture, atypical, parasite, and rare pathogens, such as Mycobacterium Tuberculosis and Toxoplasma gondii. On the other side, it also has shortcomings such as its high cost, complex process, specimen contamination, etc. Fasciola hepatica was detected both in the blood and liver tissues of this case, with corresponding treatment, the clinical symptoms and imaging manifestations were recovered. The peripheral blood was sent for mNGS again after drug withdrawal, and no reads of Fasciola hepatica were detected. It proved the effectiveness and specificity of mNGS for the detection of parasites. We believe that the application of mNGS in pathogen identification will guide the clinical diagnosis and treatment, and then greatly improve the accuracy and benefit patients.",
