            "text": "The clinical progress of patients hospitalized due to COVID-19 is often associated with severe pneumonia which may require intensive care, invasive ventilation, or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). The length of intensive care and the duration of these supportive therapies are clinically relevant outcomes. From the statistical perspective, these quantities are challenging to estimate due to episodes being timedependent and potentially multiple, as well as being determined by the competing, terminal events of discharge alive and death. Methods: We used multistate models to study COVID-19 patients' time-dependent progress and provide a statistical framework to estimate hazard rates and transition probabilities. These estimates can then be used to quantify average sojourn times of clinically important states such as intensive care and invasive ventilation. We have made two real data sets of COVID-19 patients (n = 24* and n = 53**) and the corresponding statistical code publically available. Results: The expected lengths of intensive care unit (ICU) stay at day 28 for the two cohorts were 15.05* and 19.62** days, while expected durations of mechanical ventilation were 7.97* and 9.85** days. Predicted mortality stood at 51%* and 15%**. Patients mechanically ventilated at the start of the example studies had a longer expected duration of ventilation (12.25*, 14.57** days) compared to patients non-ventilated (4.34*, 1.41** days) after 28 days. Furthermore, initially ventilated patients had a higher risk of death (54%* and 20%** vs. 48%* and 6%**) after 4 weeks. These results are further illustrated in stacked probability plots for the two groups from time zero, as well as for the entire cohort which depicts the predicted proportions of the patients in each state over follow-up. Conclusions: The multistate approach gives important insights into the progress of COVID-19 patients in terms of ventilation duration, length of ICU stay, and mortality. In addition to avoiding frequent pitfalls in survival analysis, the methodology enables active cases to be analyzed by allowing for censoring. The stacked probability plots provide extensive information in a concise manner that can be easily conveyed to decision makers regarding healthcare capacities. Furthermore, clear comparisons can be made among different baseline characteristics.",

The present paper demonstrates the application of statistical methods for analyzing these time-dependent types of data from hospitalized Covid-19 patients. These models effectively map the progression of diseased patients during their ICU stay. The methodology also avoids common pitfalls and biases that arise during the analysis of hospital data when using less sophisticated survival analysis methods [1, 2] . For example, treating exposures as time-fixed at baseline that can, in fact, vary over time leads to the time-dependent bias [3, 4] . Furthermore, ignoring competing events that can impede the observation of the event of interest can introduce bias and facilitate false predictions [5] . The ability of multistate models to avoid these biases was demonstrated in analyzing the effect of treatment with Oseltamivir (Tamiflu) on hospital mortality and length of stay in confirmed pandemic influenza A/H1N1 2009 infected patients [6, 7] . In this current demonstration, invasive mechanical ventilation is treated as time-dependent while competing risks are adequately accounted for, thus avoiding the aforementioned biases.",

These two states are called transient states. The model includes two absorbing states from which a patient no longer transitions: discharged alive from the ICU (State 3: \"Discharge\") and dead (State 4: \"Death\"). From ICU without ventilation, a patient can either be ventilated, discharged, or die. From ventilation, a patient can transition into non-ventilation, discharge, or death.

The paper provides individual patient information including treatment with invasive mechanical ventilation times, as well as final outcomes (discharged alive, dead). Periods of acute care were also provided but due to the small size of the sample, we dichotomized the patients into two states: \"Non-MV\" (ICU without MV and acute care) and \"MV\" (ICU with MV). This dichotomization matches the model presented in Fig. 1 . Maximum follow-up was 31 days with each patient having at least 14 days of follow-up. At admission, 13 (54%) patients were Non-MV while 11 (46%) were MV. Seven patients were censored. Table 1 shows a portion of the data set extracted from the published figure and adapted to the model in Fig. 1 . For example, patient with id 1 started Non-MV ('from' = 1) at ICU admission ('entry' = 0) and transitioned into MV ('to' = 2) on day 5 ('exit' =5). Patient 1 then moved back into Non-MV on day 16, before being censored on day 25 ('to' = 0). ID 2 died ('to' = 4) on day 1. The patient with ID 3 started MV, transitioned into Non-MV on day 12, and then is discharged ('to' = 3) on day 15. Data is required to be put into this form for the functions that are provided.

For example, a patient starting unventilated at the beginning of his/her ICU stay had a much shorter expected duration of ventilation (4.34 days) than a patient already ventilated at ICU admission (12.25 days). Using the initial distribution, the weighted average of the expected durations in each state determined the expected total ICU time (15.05 days). This information is vital for advance planning of both ventilation and ICU capacities. The same is true for Fig. 2 : we multiplied the transition matrix (eq. (16)) by the initial distribution to produce the stacked probability plot that illustrates the predicted proportions of the states throughout the entire follow up. At day 21 after ICU admission, for instance, a predicted 21% of patients are already discharged, 18% are not invasively ventilated, 10% need invasive mechanical ventilation, and mortality is predicted at 51%. With respect to the relatively high level of predicted mortality based on this cohort, it should be noted that 4 deceased patients had do-not-resuscitate orders in place before their admission.

Similar to example 1, patients initially MV had a longer expected ICU stay (20.71 vs. 17.67 days) at 28 days. Figure 4 sheds light onto this finding by comparing the clinical progression for patients starting in the two initial states. The increased size of the sample in example 2 allows such visual comparisons to be made. At 21 days of follow-up, patients starting in Non-MV had a higher probability of being discharged alive (60% vs. 31%) and a lower probability of dying (6% vs. 20%). ICU duration is shortened by a higher death probability in initially MV patients and a higher discharge probability for initially non-MV patients. This underlines the influence these competing events have on the lengths of stay. Figure 4 visually illustrates the marked difference in the progression of the hospital stay of patients in these two groups. It indicates that the ventilator demands of patients who are initially admitted non-ventilated are different from those who are ventilated at admission.

            "text": "Here multistate methodology could be applied by modeling the transient states of \"hospitalized\" and \"non-hospitalized\" with a transition into \"death\" from both states. There are several advantages to this model. First, all patients can be included in one analysis through assignment into one of the initial states (\"hospitalized\" and \"non-hospitalized). Similar to our comparison of stacked probability plots in Fig. 4 , we could then compare the risk of death for these two groups. Second, the model accounts for the time-dependent nature of hospitalization by allowing for several admission and discharge transitions. The allowance of repeated transitions among initial states is an advantage over standard competing risk models. This further highlights the utility of the proposed methods in epidemic/pandemic settings. Although the sizes of our two data samples are rather modest, the volume and availability of COVID-19 data is expanding. These methods applied to more detailed patient data could produce very informative plots for comparing age, gender, underlying health condition, or even different treatment arms [17] . This expanding capability to compare groups visually as data sets increase in size was demonstrated in Fig. 4 , which was informative for the larger of our two real data sets. Furthermore, depictions like the second figures in Bhatraju et al. [8] and Grein et al. [9] provide an impression for the viewer when the sample sizes are small. However, such depictions are overwhelming and difficult to read with larger data sets. In contrast, the stacked probability plots incorporate all of the information in the aforementioned figures into one easy-to-view illustration regardless of the size of the sample. Naturally, the precision of the stacked probability plots increases with an expanding number of patients.",

            "text": "There are several limitations to our demonstration. First, we chose the model in Fig. 1 as it reflected the observed transitions recorded in the two data sets. The observations included patients who were discharged from the ICU directly from being mechanically ventilated; in other words without first being non-ventilated in the ICU. From a clinical standpoint, these observed transitions do not occur. Either the patients were extubated and remained in the ICU for a couple hours, or were transferred to another ICU unit. In either case, there may be reason to adjust the data set by censoring these observations. Second, the lengths of stay estimates do not distinguish between the final outcomes of discharge alive and death. While these estimates are relevant for planning capacities, they are less clinically relevant. An alternative would be to evaluate, for example, time alive without mechanical ventilation. Third, we performed LOCF on the example 2 data to handle periods of missing information on a patient's level of oxygen support. While this simplified the analysis, it is likely that transitions between states occurred for longer periods of missing information.",
