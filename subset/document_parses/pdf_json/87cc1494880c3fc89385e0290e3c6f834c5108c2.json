Economic development is always given more preference over environmental sustainability. The COVID-19 pandemic is the result of ignorance to have an adequate number of basic infrastructure facilities including healthcare infrastructure and less importance to sustainable environment. The number of confirmed COVID-19 cases are more in the high-density settlements both at global and national level. Therefore, it becomes crucial to develop Indian cities, which are sustainable and capable to fulfil the needs of the citizens by providing smart solutions. A smart city provides smart services to the residents by using Information and Communication Technology, Information Technology, Internet of Things, Artificial Intelligence, and Machine Learning as an integrated part of governance for development. Hence, it is essential to develop smart sustainable cities followed by smart regions, which are well synchronised with the digital technology, as a precautionary measure before an epidemic becomes a pandemic through spatial-statistical analysis. The aforesaid digital model of smart cities is capable of reducing the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic by analysing the real-time data, which can further be extended to smart regions.",

It leads to the integrated development of physical, institutional, social, and economic infrastructure through retrofitting, redevelopment, greenfield development, and pan-city development [10] . However, a sustainable city focuses to reduce the ecological footprint through environmental management. It aims to provide a safe and healthy environment to the people along with the economic growth of the nation. Moreover, ICT has significantly helpful to attain sustainable development through Digital Citizen Participation (DCP), giving rise to the concept of Smart Sustainable City [3] . Though, as per the Indian Smart Cities Mission Statement and Guidelines (2015), sustainable environment is considered under one of the core infrastructure elements. Therefore, the term sustainable is silent in the case of Indian smart cities. Additionally, smart cities have laid down its foundation on high-density development. Thus, the smart cities need to be well synchronised with the digital technology to take precautionary measures, before an epidemic becomes a pandemic, through spatial-statistical analysis. The contribution of the chapter lies in developing a digital model for Indian smart cities by integrating spatial data with digital technology. Moreover, the research tries to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic at global, national, state, and district level through spatial-statistical analysis, in order to efficiently turn the weakness into the opportunities for the future smart cities of India. Section 1.2 describes the major sources used for data collection besides the research design adopted by the authors in the research. Section 1.3 illustrates the etymology of COVID-19 from a mysterious pneumonia to an epidemic, which later declared as a pandemic by the World Health Organisation (WHO). The impact of the pandemic is also analysed through descriptive and analytical research at the global level. Section 1.4 focuses on the spatial-statistical analysis at national and state level supported by the available literature. The analysis helps to perceive the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic on India's demographic structure. Section 1.5 explains the need of smart and sustainable cities and emphasises the importance of latest digital technology in the modern era. The performance of districts having identified smart cities has been assessed along with the government initiative to combat against the COVID-19 pandemic. Section 1.6 highlights the major issues, which are identified through the research. Then, Sect. 1.7 discusses the recommendations formulated to overcome the identified issues and needs to create smart regions. In addition, a future digital model is proposed, which can be replicated under the same and different geographical locations, to reduce the adverse effect of a pandemic on the smart and sustainable cities. At last, Sect. 1.8 concludes the chapter with a summary.",

The data has been downloaded by the authors on 18 July 2020, which is last updated at 7:47 pm Central European Summer Time (CEST) on 17 July 2020. The day-wise data of the pandemic before 11 January 2020 is not available on the WHO website, which acts as one of the limitations. As a result of which, the authors are compelled to rely on articles to get the initial spreading details of the COVID-19. Furthermore, WHO does not provide the state-wise data of COVID-19 for India. Therefore, 'Coronavirus Outbreak in India' website is referred to get the COVID-19 data at national, state, and district level. In the case of India, 24 weeks data has been collected and analysed, i.e. from 30 January 2020 to 15 July 2020, as the first confirmed case of COVID-19 has been reported on 30 January 2020 in the state of Kerala [26] . The COVID-19 data at the city level is not available as of 20 July 2020 on the official website of India i.e. 'Coronavirus Outbreak in India'. Thus, city-level analysis is beyond the scope of this chapter. Furthermore, the demographic profile of the country is collected from the Census of India, which is available on the website of Office of the Registrar General & Census Commissioner, India (ORGI).",

The symptoms associated with the mysterious pneumonia were fever, fatigue, dry cough, and occasional gastrointestinal. Later, the pathogen of the outbreak was identified as a novel beta-coronavirus and named as 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). As per the official data, the first confirmed case of 2019-nCoV had been reported in China in the first week of December 2019. The local health authority of the city had announced the epidemiologic alert in the area on 31 December 2019. Thus, the market area was shut down as a precautionary measure to control the spread of nCoV-19 on 1 January 2020. Outside China, the first case was reported in Thailand on 13 January 2020. After that, the 2019-nCoV was started spreading across the world in the few weeks of January 2020. Ultimately, WHO had declared the outbreak constitutes a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) on 30 January 2020. The nCoV-19 outbreak expanded to at least 25 countries till 6 February 2020. WHO had given the name to the disease as Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19) on 11 February 2020. The virus, which causes the COVID-19, was named as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) on the same date, i.e. 11 February 2020 [37, 39, 40] . Finally, WHO had declared the disease as a 'Pandemic' due to increase in the number of COVID-19 confirmed cases all across the globe (in 114 countries) on 11 March 2020 [38] (Fig. 1.1 ).",

The urban settlements have now become either the originator of infectious diseases or propagate it exponentially because of the high population density and urbanisation rate, e.g. the COVID-19 pandemic emerged in Wuhan city of China [17] . Later, the virus spread through different modes of transport based on the travelling behaviour of an individual at both international and domestic level through airways and domestic public transport, respectively [19] . Economic development has always given more importance [37, 39, 40] over environmental sustainability. It leads to an increase in the level of urbanisation, creates an ecological imbalance, degradation of environment, and so on. All such phenomenon has the ability to accelerate the process of virus transmission from one person to another [4] . Globally, the total number of confirmed COVID-19 cases has exceeded 13.61 million mark with a Case Fatality Rate (CFR) of around 4.30% (0.58 million people) till 17 July 2020 [35] . Out of the six regions on the globe, the American region is the worst affected region due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The maximum number of confirmed cases and death due to COVID-19 have been recorded in the American Region with 52.55% (7.15 million) and 50.85% (0.29 million), respectively, followed by Europe and Eastern Mediterranean Region (Table 1 .1).

From the analysis, it is observed that the three weeks period is [35] very crucial, which lasts from the 12th to 15th week, in order to control the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic by taking appropriate measures. Moreover, the number of new cases per week in SEARO and AFRO regions is increasing continuously week after week; whereas, EMRO region shows a decline from the 23rd week onwards. The AMRO has also recorded the highest number of death due to COVID-19 with 0.29 million till 17 July 2020 followed by EURO and EMRO with 0.21 million and 0.03 million, respectively ( Fig. 1.4) . The exponential increase led to more fatalities as the AMRO was not able to check on the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 during the initial 14 weeks. As a consequence of which, the total number of deaths in the AMRO is increasing linearly. On the other hand, EURO has recorded the maximum number [35] of deaths per week for the initial 15 weeks in the world but, after that, managed to control the situation in the latter weeks ( Fig. 1.5) . Additionally, lesser number of deaths are recorded in EMRO, SEARO, AFRO, and WPRO due to less number of confirmed COVID-19 cases as compared to AMRO and EURO.",

Percentage of Active Cases is marked with ** ; 3. Average recovery rate of top 6 affected states is marked with ## ; 4. CFR is marked with # the authors. The district-level data has been collected and compared with the nationallevel data. In India, the total number of districts are 640 [5] . The 100 smart cities have been distributed in the 97 districts (15%) of the nation. The share of COVID-19 confirmed cases in these 97 districts is around 52.65% (0.51 million). Moreover, out of the total death (0.02 million) due to COVID-19, 54.18% (0.01 million) people died in these 15% (97) districts of India. Additionally, the share of COVID-19 cases registered in the districts of identified smart cities with the remaining districts of the respective state is high in all aforesaid 6 states as compared to the remaining state of India ( Fig. 1.11 ). All these states are also having a high number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in the state as well as in the respective districts of identified smart cities. Hence, as per the analysis, it is observed that the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is comparatively more in the states having more number of smart cities. Also, the states with maximum number of smart cities are dynamic in nature, i.e. Delhi (National Capital of the country), Maharashtra (Nashik: Wine Capital of India; Pune: Queen of Deccan; Nagpur: Orange City; Thane: City of Lakes), Tamil Nadu (Coimbatore: Manchester of South India; Chennai: Health Capital of India; Madurai: Temple City; Tiruchirappalli: Rock Fort City; Tirunelveli: Oxford City of South India), Uttar Pradesh (Agra: City of Taj; Allahabad: Abode of the God; Kanpur: Leather City of the World; Lucknow: City of Nawabs; Varanasi: Religious Capital of India), etc [24] . Thus, the vibrant function of cities has become a node for the surrounding areas, which attracts the major part of the population from the surrounding areas as well as neighbouring districts. In turn, the process leads to more interaction and increases the overall population density of the cities and regions.

Lakshadweep is the COVID-19 free UT as no case has been registered as of 15 July 2020; 2. District-level data is not available for the state of Telangana and NCT Delhi (UT); 3. Ladakh (UT) does not have any smart city a consequence of which, the rapid transmission of SARS-CoV-2 has been recorded in the states having more number of smart cities.",

Thus, it is a major challenge with such a populous country to test its total population with a limited number of health infrastructure facilities; (iv) Inadequate Healthcare Infrastructure: With a population of more than 1,210 million, India has lesser number of ICU beds with the ventilator. The states constitute the major portion healthcare facilities have registered higher COVID-19 cases is also a major concern; (v) Non-Availability of Latest Demographic Data: Census of India conduct the survey and collect data once in ten years. The last census has been carried out before 9 years, i.e. in 2011. Thus, the non-availability of demographic data is one of the major concerns as all the infrastructure facilities including healthcare infrastructure are provided based on the settlement population threshold limit; and (vi) Data Discrepancy: State government and Urban Local Bodies (ULBs) have failed miserably to maintain the demographic record of their respective region/settlements.

The detailed spatial plans shall be prepared on Geographic Information System (GIS) at grassroots levels, i.e. wards, and linked with the city, district, state, and national. The potential areas to be utilised under any pandemic situation shall also be marked spatially on the spatial plan. It will enable the government to geo-tag the patient's location and identify the hotspot areas; (b) Non-Spatial Data: includes the demographic profile of the city including big data related to infrastructure such as number of beds, ICU, ventilators, and so on. The interlinkage of spatial and non-spatial data with the help of digital technology, i.e. through Geographic Information System (GIS), will provide the real-time status of each settlement of the nation.

(i) Personal data: includes the information related to individuals, from which the individual can be identified. The information collected at a different time or from different sources, when collected together can lead to the identification of an individual, also consider a part of personal data. Such data is either not published by the government on the open-access platforms under any data set or must be anonymised before publishing; (ii) Non-Personal Data: consists of anonymous information, which does not possess any personally identifiable information.

The Level 2 information is available to the ULBs and associated employees in order to deliver the public services efficiently. Level 3 constitutes the 'Sensitive Data', which has some attributes of individual personal information. At this level, the data is regulated through the laws and regulations by the ULBs or District or State or Central such as Privacy Law. Level 4 includes the 'Protected Data'. It contains all the identity details of the citizens of the country. Level 5 comprises the 'Restricted Data'. It is the most sensitive data, which includes personal information besides the assets. The data of critical infrastructure and national security is also stored at this level. The data is accessible through a prescribed process, which is regulated by the respected ministry or department of Central and State government, respectively. Therefore, the breach of restricted data could prompt danger to life or a threat to national security. The City Data Cell, State Level Data Analytics and Management Unit, and Data Analytics and Management (DAM) Unit is proposed to monitor the process at city, state, and national level [11] . The data, under all the five levels, can easily be shared between the proposed 100 smart cities as well.

The pandemic has created a problematic situation by highlighting the drawbacks of high population density areas. The COVID-19 has adversely affected the economy of all countries. In India, the states and UTs having more number of smart cities are worst affected by the pandemic. The same trend is visible at the district level. The districts with more number of smart cities have registered more number of COVID-19 cases as compared to the remaining districts of the respective state of India. However, the regions with less number of smart cities have performed better such as the Himalayas region, NE regions, and some UTs. Majorly, all the compact cities including smart cities, which are developed on the concept of high population density, good connectivity, and city functionality, have failed to sustain during the pandemic situation due to less awareness among the people, immoral behaviour of individuals, inappropriate healthcare infrastructure facilities, and non-availability of updated demographic data.",

Additionally, an appropriate government will collect the demographic details by using a smartphone as the smallest unit of data collection under DCP through the internet and locate the people's location spatially through GPS. The integration of the collected information through digital technology on GIS will allow real-time spatial-statistical analysis. The digital model will be extended to cover other infrastructure facilities in all smart cities of the nation and can be replicated under the same and different geographical locations. Therefore, the smart sustainable cities will integrate the digital technology (to make the cities smart), infrastructure (including sustainable environment), and people (through DCP) under one umbrella.

For the purpose of controlling the spread of SARS-CoV-2 virus, GoI had divided the districts into three major zones based on the number of COVID-19 cases, i.e. (i) Red Zone: areas with high number of cases besides doubling rate of less than 4 days; (ii) Orange Zone: areas with few cases and no increase in new cases; (iii) Green Zone: areas with no case.The list of restricted and permissible activities had also been issued by the GoI for all the three aforesaid zones. Finally, GoI had proposed some relaxation and implemented Unlock-1 (1 June to 30 June 2020) followed by Unlock-2 (1 July to 31 July 2020) with a complete shut down of educational and recreational space[21] (Fig. 1.6).",
