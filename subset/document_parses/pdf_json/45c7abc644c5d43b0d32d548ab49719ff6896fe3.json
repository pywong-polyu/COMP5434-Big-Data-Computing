However, in the later stages of the pandemic, symptoms similar to severe multisystemic hyperinflammatory syndrome that did not resemble the acute form of COVID-19 began to be observed in children. Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children associated with COVID-19 (MIS-C) was reported for the first time in April 2020 in children from the UK and the USA, who were previously healthy but were determined to have a positive severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) or serology testing for SARS-CoV-2. Fever, abdominal pain, rash and conjunctivitis, and increased acute phase reactants and cardiac markers, often accompanied by hypotensive shock and myocardial dysfunction have been identified in children diagnosed with MIS-C. In MIS-C, there is a previous COVID-19 infection in children, a family history of the disease, or a history of contact with an infected individual, and symptoms occur approximately within two to three weeks after COVID-19. Unlike acute COVID-19 infection, many systems are affected due to the inflammatory response that develops, and some radiological findings occur due to the pathologies that occur. Although radiological findings are not typical, they may be of warning findings for the diagnosis of MIS-C when correlated with clinical and laboratory findings and if other pathologies are excluded.",

Since the findings in five cases suggested acute appendicitis, abdominal US and then CT examinations were also performed. The appendix was evaluated to be normal in these examinations.

Radiological findings showing pancreatic and liver involvement were observed in one patient. In one of our patients, a thrombus was detected in the vena cava inferior, which we considered to be due to coagulation disorder, while pancreatic involvement and related atrophy and necrosis were detected in the pancreas of another case. In addition, the latter had cholestasis in the intrahepatic biliary tracts due to liver involvement, which we visualized radiologically.

In adult cases, infection due to COVID-19, venous sinus thrombus, encephalomyelitis, Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, Miller Fisher syndrome, myelitis, and PRES have been described in the literature (17, 18) . The neurological findings of COVID 19 and MIS-C in children have been attributed to direct neuronal damage, vascular endothelial damage, and inflammatory and autoimmune damage (19) . The neuroradiological findings reported in MIS-C cases in the literature are from a multicenter study (20) and case reports (21-23) and remain limited. Orman et al. found neuroradiological findings in only 10% of the cases diagnosed with COVID-19 who underwent a neuroradiological examination (24) . These findings were reported as PRES and hippocampal signal changes. Different neurological findings were observed in 31% of our MIS-C cases, and we observed radiological findings in 64% of these patients. While only two of our cases had other system involvement, the others presented with only neurological findings. The most common finding was RESLES, which is also frequently reported in the (20) . Similar findings to our case have been reported in adults and patients with acute hemorrhagic necrotizing encephalomyelitis, which is rarely described on a case-by-case basis in the literature (17, 18, 25) . Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome is another pathology reported in MIS-C cases (26) . We did not observe myelitis in our cases, in contrast to Kaur et al. (27) .

In one patient who presented with hallucinations and seizures, cranial MRI showed symmetrical signal changes in the cerebellar hemispheres, periaqueductal region, mesencephalon, bilateral hypothalamic region, bilateral thalamus, lentiform nucleus, caudate nucleus, deep white matter, and subcortical area with no diffusion restriction or contrast enhancement. These entities were considered as ADEM-like lesions(Figure 4a-c). The spinal MRI of the same patient was normal. Following the initiation of treatment, the clinical state of the patient first improved, but five days later, seizures were observed again. Although the lesions had completely disappeared according to the cranial MRI examination, new pathological signal changes were in the bilateral parietooccipital and bilateral frontoparietal regions without contrast enhancement or diffusion restriction. These new lesions were evaluated as posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) (Figure 4d-f). In another patient with seizure complaints, MRI was performed in the bilateral frontoparietal region, and bilateral parietal lesions with cortiko-subcortical symmetrical diffusion restriction and contrast enhancement were detected. This patient was evaluated to have an ADEM-like lesion, which was found to increase and be accompanied by necrotic areas in the repeated MRI examination after the aggravation of clinical manifestation during the follow-up. Furthermore, laminar necrosis was added to the findings, and it was evaluated as acute hemorrhagic necrotizing encephalomyelitis (Figure 5). The another patient had presented with the complaint of inability to walk and had complete loss of deep tendon reflexes when he arrived. While the cranial MRI was normal, the contrastenhanced spinal MRI revealed diffuse contrast involvement in the cauda equina fibers and nerve roots. When combined with electromyography (EMG) findings, the acute motor axonal neuropathy (AMAN) type was evaluated as Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome (Figure 6). The another patient presented with disorientation and involvement of various systems. MRI was performed and revealed cerebral and cerebellar atrophy, as well as bilateral symmetrical diffuse signal changes and volume loss in periventricular deep white matter. The findings were not directly linked to COVID-19. Although there were neurological findings in four cases (%29), no cranial imaging finding was observed. Discussion MIS-C can be defined as inflammation caused by excessive immune response that develops after acute COVID-19 infection in children. Unlike acute COVID-19 infection, MIS-C comorbidity does not occur in children but it develops in healthy children (1). Pneumonia and flu-like symptoms observed in acute disease are not present in these children. Clinical findings in children appear within two to three weeks after previous infection. RT-PCR or serology positivity for SARS-CoV-2 , indicating that the infection was passed (2). With the increasing number of cases, WHO (3), Royal Collage (4) and disease control unit (5) have defined diagnostic criteria for this newly identified disease. Imaging findings of MIS-C associated with COVID-19 differ depending on the inflammatory process involved in various systems. A limited number of studies have shown that radiological findings observed are non-specific and cannot be used as diagnostic criteria. However, some radiological findings can alert the radiologist and clinician to the suspicion of MIS-C. In particular, if there is a history of contact with a COVID-19-infected individual and other possible diagnoses have been excluded, radiological findings can be significant in the diagnosis of MIS-C.",

There are many lymph nodes in the right lower quadrant of the abdomen, and the ileal loops contain Peyer's patches with lymphoid tissue. Similar to mesenteric lymphadenitis, inflammation in lymphatic structures causes symptoms similar to acute appendicitis. These abdominal findings observed in MIS-C cases have been attributed to systemic inflammation, hypoalbuminemia, serositis, fluid overload, and cardiac failure. In a case series of Hameed et al., solid organ infractions such as splenic infarction have been reported and associated with the inflammatory vasculitis of vascular structures that feed the organs(7). A thrombus is frequently observed in various abdominal large vascular structures due to the increase in coagulation factors in adult COVID-19 cases. In addition, the liver and the biliary system are the most frequently affected systems after pulmonary involvement(10).",

The most common cause of transient splenial lesions in children is mild encephalopathy with a reversible splenial lesion (MERS), which develops secondary to focal intramyelinic edema due to inflammation (21). In addition, RESLES may develop due to ischemia, status epilepticus, and electrolyte irregularities . The splenial lesion is observed in the posterior part of the corpus callosum body as an oval form of temporary diffusion restriction. In our series, it was observed in 43% of the cases and disappeared in the control diffusion MRI examinations performed after the initiation of treatment and improvement of neurological findings. Furthermore, one of our cases presented with ADEM-like lesions, while another case developed acute hemorrhagic necrotizing encephalomyelitis. A patient with gait disorder and muscle weakness was diagnosed with Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome. In a retrospective study conducted by Lindan et al., ADEM-like lesions were the most frequent findings, while myelitis and enhancement were also observed in cranial nerve and spinal nerve roots.
