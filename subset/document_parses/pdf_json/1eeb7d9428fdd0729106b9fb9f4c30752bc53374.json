Rapid diagnosis of the disease and isolation of patients are effective ways to prevent and control the spread of COVID-19. Therefore, a sensitive immunofluorescent assay method was developed for rapid detection of special IgM and IgG of COVID-19 in human serum within 10 min. The recombinant nucleocapsid protein of 2019 novel coronavirus was used as capture antigen. Lanthanide, Eu(III) fluorescent microsphere, was used to qualitatively/semiquantitatively determine the solid phase immunochromatographic assay. A total of 28 clinical positive and 77 negative serum or plasma samples were included in the test. Based on the analysis of serum or plasma from COVID-19 patients and healthy people, the sensitivity and specificity of the immunochromatographic assay were calculated as 98.72% and 100% (IgG), and 98.68% and 93.10% (IgM), respectively. The results demonstrated that rapid immunoassay has high sensitivity and specificity and was useful for rapid serodiagnosis of COVID-19.",

The procedures were briefed in the following steps: First, microspheres (3.125 \u00d7 10 6 ) were added into 250 \u03bcL buffer with 0.250 mL 0.1 M NaH 2 PO 4 (pH 6.2) buffer and sonicated for 1 min.

The phosphate buffered saline (PBS) (PH 7.4) was used to wash the microspheres twice. The activated microspheres were added into 0.5 mL PBS buffer containing 12.5 \u03bcg NP, and the whole mixture was rotated and incubated for 3 h at room temperature to complete the coupling process.

            "text": "SARS-CoV2 IgG/IgM rapid immunochromatographic assay was tested with a total of 28 positive and 77 negative serum or plasma samples. The results were exported from the immunochromatographic reader and analyzed on Microsoft Excel software. The following formulas were used for calculating the specificity and sensitivity rate: The IgM value of negative samples ranged from 0 to 0.0234 (average = 0.0094; SD = 0.0035) and that of positive samples ranged from 0.0181 to 0.0839 (average = 0.0381; SD = 0.0169) (P < 0.001). The IgG value of negative samples ranged from 0.0079 to 0.0486 (average = 0.0231; SD = 0.0080) and that of positive samples ranged from 0 to 1.8328 (average = 0.7675; SD = 0.4633) (P < 0.001). The normal distribution curves of IgM and IgG were made from readings. The difference of IgG values between positive and negative samples was large enough to distinguish with the naked eye by using a UV lamp, but the difference of IgM values between positive and negative samples was too little to distinguish with the naked eye; the critical IgM value could only be distinguished by professional instruments. Based on the test data of serum or plasma from COVID-19 patients and healthy people, the sensitivity and specificity of the immunochromatographic assay were calculated as 98.72% and 100% (IgG), and 98.68% and 93.10% (IgM), respectively. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis showed AUC, 0.994; 95% CI, 0.986 to 1.000 for IgM, and AUC, 0.964; 95% CI, 0.896 to 1.000 for IgG ( Figure 3 ). Since the test time of immunochromatographic assay was set to 10 min, the method was shown to be successful for rapid serodiagnosis of COVID-19.",

            "text": "The major finding of our clinical evaluation of the SARS-CoV2 IgG/IgM rapid immunochromatographic assay was that this rapid detection method solved the problem of rapid quantification of serum antibody. Since IgM is the earliest antibody produced by the human body after infection with the virus, 15, 19 it is the most valuable index for early clinical serodiagnosis of COVID-19. Nevertheless, IgM's output is lower than that of IgG, making the inspection more difficult. In our rapid detection assay, the IgM values of positive samples were obviously lower than that of IgG. Only professional equipment could distinguish the differences of the IgM value between positive and negative samples in some cases. Fluorescence immunochromatography solved the important defect of gold colloid technology, which is difficult to quantify and was more sensitive and specific than the traditional colloidal gold immunochromatography. Therefore, the lanthanide, Eu (III) fluorescent microsphere based immunochromatography was suitable for SARS-CoV2 diagnosis. 20\u221222 Coronaviruses are RNA viruses, which can cause respiratory, enteric, hepatic, and neurologic diseases among humans, mammals, and birds. Up to the present day, there are seven coronavirus species; among them there are three strains, 2003 SARS-CoV, 2012 MERS-CoV, and 2019 SARS-CoV-2, which can cause serious respiratory and even fatal illness. 3\u22125 SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the \u03b2 coronavirus genus, just similar to SARS-CoV 2003 and MERS-CoV 2012. Its genome size is about 30 kilobases encoding several nonstructural and structural proteins. There are four kinds of main structural proteins include NP, spike protein, membrane protein, and envelope protein. Within these proteins, NP is a more valuable diagnostic candidate for the following reasons. NP has low polymorphism and high expression level in coronaviruses. 23, 24 The amino acid sequence of NP of SARS-CoV2 was just similar to another human infectious coronavirus (SARS-CoV), bat coronavirus and pangolin coronavirus, and that was different from another human infectious coronavirus such as MERS-CoV or other animal coronavirus with a similarity of amino acid sequence less than 50%. Previous study suggested that antibodies were generated during infection against the NP of SARS-CoV, the most abundantly expressed structural protein with high immunogenicity, and it was also highly prevalent in SARS-CoV patients. NP of SARS-CoV2 is more conservative when compared with S protein, but it is quite different from other human infectious coronaviruses except SARS-CoV. The recombinant NP had cross reactivity with antibodies from SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 patients by dotblot, and the rapid immunochromatographic assay was also. The cross reaction with SARS virus antibody during the SARS-CoV2 epidemic probably would not hinder the application of the detection kit. Therefore, NP was used as the diagnostic antigen in this study.",

This complex migrates through nitrocellulose membrane by capillary action from nitrocellulose. When the complex meets the line of the corresponding immobilized antibody (anti-human IgM and/or anti-human IgG) the complex is trapped, and fluorescence can be detected showing a positive result. The fluorescence intensity can be used to quantitate the concentration of targeting IgM/IgG. Absence of fluorescence or low fluorescence indicates a negative result.
