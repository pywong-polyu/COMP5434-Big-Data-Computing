Data National and local statistics on US traffic volume, traffic fatalities, injury accidents, speeding violations, running of stop signs, and other indicators of vehicular driving behavior, both in 2020 and in previous US economic recessions affecting the volume of road traffic. Methods Comparative analysis of the similarities and differences between the data for the COVID-19 lockdown in parts of the USA in March 2020 and similar data for the 2008-2009 global economic crisis, as well as other US cases of major reductions in traffic volume. Findings The volume of traffic contracted sharply once a COVID-19 national emergency was declared and most states issued stay-at-home orders, but motor vehicle fatality rates, injury accidents, and speeding violations went up, and remained elevated even as traffic began returning toward normal. This pattern does not fit post-World War II recessions where fatality rates declined with the volume of traffic nor does the 2020 pattern match the pattern during World War II when traffic dropped substantially with little change in motor vehicle fatality rates. Conclusions The findings are consistent with a theory of social distancing on highways undermining compliance with social norms, a social cost of COVID which, if not corrected, poses potential long-term increases in non-compliance and dangerous driving.",

            "text": "A 20-year-old man was killed and a woman was injured in a crash early Friday on the Benjamin Franklin Parkway, Philadelphia police said. The pair were among four people in a black Volkswagen Jetta that investigators believe was speeding up the Parkway about 4:20 a.m. when the driver apparently lost control of the car near 20th Street, then struck a tree and a pole on the center median. An eyewitness told police the car was one of three driving fast at the same time, but Capt. Mark Overwise of the Accident Investigation District said it didn't appear to be a drag race or \"drag racing the way you see it in South Philly,\" with a start and finish line. (Shaw 2020) Something unusual happened beginning in March 2020. While driving decreased substantially as COVID-19 spread and stay-at-home orders were issued in late March and early April, motor vehicle fatality rates and the severity of accidents shot up for the cars remaining on the road. There is almost no precedent for a simultaneous decline in traffic and spike in fatality rates and accident severity. In past economic downturns, declining traffic has led to declines in fatality rates and accident severity. A partial explanation, I'll argue, lies in the suddenness and magnitude of the decline that created an experiment in social distancing, in this instance between drivers, unlike any within memory and with consequences neither our politicians nor our public health experts fully anticipated though some traffic engineers did.",

            "text": "I begin from a sociological perspective. The highways are a microcosm of society, and what we are sensing in society is more readily observable on the highways. Here I will connect fatalities and injuries on the highways with our management, or lack of management, of our response to COVID-19 and how it has disrupted society. I argue that our highways have become Hobbesian to draw attention to and provide a quantitative glimpse into larger problems triggered by our response to I'll begin with a brief exposition of Hobbes's Leviathan. I'll then argue that we have performed an experiment in social distancing on the highways and this experiment seems to have made driving more like Hobbes's \"state of nature\"-in other words, the rules of the road have gone into abeyance and driving has become more dangerous. This will be backed by data on traffic volume, fatalities, injury accidents, speeding violations, and even the running of stop signs. These data show essentially two things: first, the volume of traffic contracted sharply once a COVID-19 national emergency was declared and most states issued stay-at-home orders; and, second, motor vehicle fatality rates, injury accidents, and speeding violations went up, in some instances sharply, and remained elevated even as traffic began returning toward normal. This pattern does not fit post-World War II recessions where fatality rates declined with the volume of traffic nor does the pattern fit World War II when traffic dropped substantially with little change in motor vehicle fatality rates. I'll then seek to explain why the roads and highways have become more dangerous since COVID-19. A simple model from traffic engineering helps account for Hobbesian highways in the aftermath of stay-at-home and business shutdown orders. It also helps explain why motor vehicle fatality rates have dipped in past economic recessions. But it does not explain why motor vehicle fatality rates have remained high as the USA reopened. I borrow a threshold model from studies of small groups, innovation, and the sociology of collective behavior-the behavior of crowds and mobs-to explain this. I then return to the larger theme that the COVID-19 pandemic and social distancing eroded many critical though invisible social norms including everyday norms of driving on the highways as the highways emptied of traffic. I'll end with a mixed message. We have addressed highway safety before and can do it again. Still, the social costs of COVID-19, among them Hobbesian highways, need attention.",

Hence, all must agree whether voluntarily or by force to renounce most of their rights and transfer them irrevocably to a sovereign with sole power to maintain the peace. Hobbes's alternative to the Hobbesian state of nature, then, is absolutism, and philosophers, political scientists, and sociologists since have struggled to find less draconian solutions to the problem of order posed by Hobbes. How we will address the same problem of order on our highways, should they remain persistently Hobbesian as traffic returns toward normal volume, is uncertain. Should motor vehicle fatality and injury rates not return to normal, which they have not so far, we may have to consider whether a regime of strict enforcement is necessary and politically acceptable.",

Rather, vehicles are treated as physical objects occupying physical space, and the greater the spacing between vehicles the less likely they are to collide. Normally, the model of vehicles as physical objects in physical space holds since the rules of the road, especially the unwritten rules learned from experience, change slowly if at all. The question here is whether under some circumstances increased physical distance between vehicles can also cause drivers to become inattentive to each other and to the norms of driving they otherwise respect-in other words, can physical distancing of vehicles lead to social distancing of drivers with consequences opposite to those expected from physical distancing? The intuition is that a sharp and unexpected increase in the physical distancing of vehicles can create a perception that it is safe to abandon lifelong driving habits. Somewhat differently and more sociologically, if increases in dangerous driving, injury accidents, and vehicle fatalities follow sudden and substantial decreases in traffic flow, then might a reasonable inference be that that physical distancing of vehicles has also socially distanced their drivers?",

            "text": "To begin, I'll describe vehicular traffic in the USA in the spring and summer of 2020. Forty-two of the 51 states and the District of Columbia announced stay-at-home orders from March 19 (California) to April 6 (Missouri). All states except Nebraska, Wyoming, and South Dakota closed bars, restaurants, and non-essential retailers early in the COVID-19 pandemic. The impact of these stay-at-home and shutdown orders on vehicular traffic was wholly without precedent in the USA. Exhibit 1 shows the millions of vehicle miles traveled monthly in the USA from January 1970 to August 2020 reported by the Federal Highway Administration. The data are not seasonally or otherwise adjusted; hence, vehicle miles peak in the summer, almost always in July, and bottom out in mid-winter, usually February. The gray vertical bars in Exhibit 1 are periods of economic recession. As can be seen in Exhibit 1, vehicle miles trend steadily upward from 1970 through 2019 except during recessions and, in the case of the 2008-2009 recession, for several years beyond. The experience of 2020 following COVID-19 was wholly different, however. Traffic dropped 19% in March 2020 compared to March 2019 and plummeted 40%, from 282 to 168 billion vehicle miles, in April 2020 compared to April 2019. To put this in perspective, COVID-19 shutdowns reduced US vehicular traffic in April 2020 to the volume seen 32 years before in April 1988. Nationwide traffic volumes recovered somewhat in May and June and peaked in July at 262 billion vehicle miles, declining 26%, 13%, and 11% respectively from 2019. However, motor vehicle travel then slipped somewhat to 251 billion vehicle miles in August, a 12% decline from 2019.",

July basically continued June with 4020 estimated motor vehicle fatalities compared to 3530 in July 2019, up 14%. The 14% growth in fatalities, combined with an 11% decrease in vehicle miles driven, yielded a 27% increase in the July motor vehicle fatality rate, from 1.20 per 100 million miles driven in 2019 to 1.53 in 2020. And August was not dramatically different from July with 4010 estimated motor vehicle fatalities compared to 3570 in August 2019, up 12%, vehicle miles down 13%, and the motor vehicle fatality rate up 29% from 1.24 to 1.60 per 100 million vehicles miles. July 2020 also marked an unfortunate milestone as it was the first month since July 2007 when motor vehicle fatalities exceeded 4000 (National Safety Council 2020e).",

A secondary hypothesis is that fear of COVID-19 infection caused police officers to keep distance from motorists and, as a consequence, to diminish traffic enforcement efforts. I cannot prove either of these hypotheses from the data at hand. The Teletrac Navman trucking data (increased speeding, harsh cornering events, and running stop signs but fewer harsh braking events) though limited are highly suggestive regarding the first. The disproportionate decline of total traffic citations in New York City and Massachusetts are suggestive of the second. Neither drivers' distancing from each other and disregard of the rules nor the distancing of police officers from drivers, both the consequence policies taken or not taken to respond to COVID-19, can be considered favorable outcomes.

Next, motor vehicle fatality rates in the 50 states declined significantly with unemployment in the 11 years during and adjacent to the Great Recession, 2003 to 2013, and the unemployment rate was associated with reduced vehicle mileage in 88 Ohio counties from 2009 to 2013. Again, these results are inconsistent with what we have recently experienced. Finally, motor vehicle fatality rates during World War II, when the government suppressed driving, remained essentially flat, which seems to differ from the post-COVID-19 experience. An open question is whether gasoline rationing, a 35 mile-per-hour national speed limit, and government campaign against unnecessary driving, other things being equal, should have driven motor vehicle fatality rates sharply downward, which they did not.",

To further limit gasoline consumption and rubber usage, a nationwide \"victory speed\" limit of 35 miles per hour was also mandated in May 1942. Both rationing and the \"victory speed\" remained in place until VJ Day, August 14, 1945. Beyond these restrictive actions, a nationwide propaganda campaign discouraging unnecessary and unnecessarily exuberant driving or \"joy riding\" also began in 1942.

Vehicle travel increased slightly from 1943 to 1944 and then rose substantially following VJ Day in 1945.

As shown in Exhibit 9, the vehicle fatality rate per 100 million miles ranged only from 10.71 to 10.92 from 1939 to 1942 except in 1941 when it was 11.43 and 1942 when it was 10.07. 2 While the 1941-1942 decline in the motor vehicle fatality rate could be attributed to gasoline rationing, the 35 mile-perhour \"victory speed,\" and the campaign against \"joy riding,\" the 1940-1941 and 1942-1943 increases in fatality rates remain inexplicable. One can only imagine what World War II motor vehicle fatality rates would have looked like had there been no \"victory speed\" or propaganda directed against unnecessary driving.

The simplest model comes from traffic engineering where a focal problem has been the impact of highway congestion on accident rates. To oversimplify, traffic engineers fall into two camps, those finding that accidents increase in proportion to congestion (measured by traffic volume or the ratio of volume to road capacity) and those finding a curvilinear or U-shaped relationship where accident rates peak at extremely low and extremely high levels of congestion. Currently, the curvilinear camp is ascendant (Retallack and Ostendorf 2019) .",

In curvilinear models where the horizontal axis is congestion, accidents rise steeply on the left side of the U driven by careless, inattentive driving and, of course, higher speeds. In Exhibit 10, I call the left side Dodge City where there is no sheriff. The right side is driven by the physical proximity of vehicles. I call this Dodgem cars, the amusement park ride where people strap themselves into small electric vehicles designed to bump each other. The labeling of the axes in Exhibit 10 follows the traffic engineering literature where the ordinate (Y-axis) is accidents and the abscissa (X-axis) is congestion. I'm treating these axes as analogs of fatality rates and total vehicle miles driven, inexact analogs to be sure but helpful in conveying the general points.",

Point B represents a modest reduction of congestion as in recessions. Along the path from A to B, accidents (fatality rates) decrease incrementally as congestion (TVM) also decreases incrementally. Along the path from A to C, accidents (fatality rates) increase incrementally as congestion (TVM) decreases dramatically moving from the right to the left side.

As in Exhibit 10a, point A represents \"normal\" accidents (fatality rates) and congestion (TVM). Imagine now that X represents passenger vehicles and Y trucks.

Imagine X and Y are different populations of drivers driving on different roads and never mingling. Imagine also that the X population is slightly to the right, on the Dodgem car side of the curve, while Y is substantially to the left, on the Dodge City side. Again, neither X nor Y is observable but A, which combines X and Y and lies between X and Y, is. Imagine, further, that the X population limits its driving severely due to stay-at-home orders while the Y population continues to drive as usual. The consequence is that observable point A moves toward Y-in other words, accident rates (fatalities) appear to rise while congestion (TVM) appears to fall. However, no one's risk of dying on the highways has changed. Rather, Y has become a larger portion if not the entirety of A. Since we were not able to observe the difference between X and Y and the changed composition of A, we infer falsely that A has moved toward Dodge City.",

The increase in the share of rural vehicle miles may have caused a small increase in the overall motor vehicle fatality rate, but by how much is uncertain given that the urban fatality rate also increased. Another potential source of heterogeneity is in the caution exercised by drivers. It is possible that less cautious drivers and drivers having urgent business remained on the highways despite stay-at-home and shutdown orders while more cautious drivers and those having less urgent business and business that could be conducted at home actually stayed home.",

Rather than obstructing traffic and enduring honking horns and clenched fists, I speed up. So do other drivers as they gradually return to the road. At each step of the process, drivers with higher thresholds of speeding become speeders since every larger numbers of fellow drivers are speeding. Average speed stays up and accident and fatality rates remain elevated as traffic returns to normal. The prediction, consistent with the model displayed in Exhibit 10d and the July National Safety Council data, is that neither accidents nor motor vehicle fatality rates will decrease as congestion or vehicle miles traveled return toward normal with the opening of the economy.

Initially, motor vehicle fatality rates inched up as vehicular traffic dropped precipitously. This was an unusual occurrence as fatality rates normally decline when the economy slows and traffic thins. Subsequently, fatality rates continued to rise as traffic returned. The impression is that we retreated from norms of everyday driving or, at a minimum, shifted these norms in response to COVID-19 and stay-at-home and business shutdown orders. When we step back from mileage and fatality statistics and think about what ultimately caused fatality and injury accident rates to spike, the initial reaction might be that incivility has sprouted everywhere. Perhaps so, but the story of motor vehicle fatalities allows us to specify some of the mechanisms through which incivility propagates. In a sentence: the emptying of the highways in late March and April gave license to the remaining drivers to disregard the rules of the road such that others did the same when the others resumed driving from May through August.
