However, through all this, families will continue to become pregnant, give birth, and breastfeed. Unfortunately, care of the childbearing family has been de-prioritized during the pandemic. Additionally, many healthcare practices during the pandemic have not been positive for the childbearing family or breastfeeding. Despite recommendations from the World Health Organization to promote early, direct breastfeeding and skin to skin contact, these and other recommendations are not being followed in the clinical setting. For example, some mothers have been forced to go through labor and birth alone in some institutions whilst some hospitals have limited or no parental visitation to infants in the NICU. Furthermore, hospitals are discharging mothers and their newborns early, limiting the amount of time that families receive expert lactation care, education, and technical assistance. In addition, some hospitals have furloughed staff or transferred them to COVID-19 wards, further negatively impacting direct care for families and their newborns. We are concerned that these massive changes in the care of childbearing families will be permanently adopted. Instead, we must use the pandemic to underscore the importance of human milk and breastfeeding as lifesaving medical interventions. We challenge healthcare professionals to change the current prenatal and post-birth practice paradigms to protect lactation physiology and to ensure that all families in need receive equal access to evidence-based lactation education, care and technical assistance.",

The prioritization during the pandemic has been the care of the elderly and severely affected adults. However, the pandemic has also raised concerns for pregnant women and breastfeeding mothers. Newborns have been separated from their mothers and some health professionals and parents feared that human milk could transmit the virus from mother to child. This is despite the fact that from the beginning of the pandemic, the World Health Organization has endorsed early continuous skin to skin contact (SSC) and direct breastfeeding (1) .",

Families received conflicting information about allowing partners to be with them for childbirth, about whether or not direct breastfeeding and skin to skin contact were allowable, and conflicting advice about follow-up care. Consequently, both breastfeeding initiation and duration rates are at much risk for declining globally. While the authors acknowledge that some individual institutions have followed recommendations provided by the WHO, this has not occurred systemically in any country and in fact some countries such as China actively discouraged breastfeeding. While some individual hospitals may be providing expert evidence based care following WHO guidelines, this is not the cultural norm during this pandemic. This is of particular concern since breastfeeding is a lifesaving medical intervention for children, decreasing both mortality and morbidity (3) . The provision of human milk optimizes a child's short-and long-term brain development, intelligence and developmental outcomes (3). Children who receive human milk are healthier and more productive members of society (3) . Breastfeeding further improves the mothers' health by decreasing her risk of breast cancer, heart disease, postpartum depression, obesity, and diabetes (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) . The potential decrease in breastfeeding rates also negatively impacts our society overall with less healthy families, increased cost burden to parents for the purchase of infant formula, and increased cost burden to our society in terms of suboptimal health and development outcomes, health care expenditure, and impact on the environment (3).",

Half of all respondents (156/328) reported that mothers had to be alone upon entering the hospital. Most respondents (82%, or 259/328) also stated that only one support person was allowed for the childbearing woman. Additionally, 46.1% of respondents reported that only one parent was allowed to visit a child admitted to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU). Respondents also reported other changes such as higher rates of induction (23.2%) and early admission for labor (7.7%). Interestingly, the requirement of the birthing parent to wear a facemask was only reported in 30% of respondents.",

When a new virus emerges, it is important to determine if the virus can shed into human milk and be transmitted to the breastfed infant. In the case of coronaviruses, the likelihood of vertical transmission is low, with no documented cases occurring in the past with either SARS or MERS (13) . For SARS-CoV-2 the detection of viral RNA in human milk from infected women appears to be uncommon and transmission via human milk has not been recorded. Furthermore, the detection of viral RNA has only been found sporadically in samples of human milk from women infected with SARS-CoV-2 (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) (19) (20) ; with no milk samples showing active, replication-competent virus (18) , as such, in no study has infectious virus been isolated from milk.",

Interestingly, this research includes measures of stress in the milk such as cortisol, cytokines, and serotonin as these have been shown to be related to infant temperament (32) .

We acknowledge that access to PDHM is not equal in all countries in the world. However, it is also important to note that both the European Milk Banking Association (EMBA) and the Human Milk Banking Association of North America (HMBANA) have experienced inconsistent shortages of PDHM across different states and countries (50) (51) (52) . In some Italian cities such as Milan and Turin the home collection of donated human milk has been practically interrupted for 3 months during the lockdown (43) . Interestingly, in some human milk bank settings, the total amount of donated milk has on the contrary increased (51), possibly due to a stronger devotion toward the expression of milk on the part of mothers during the COVID-19 pandemic, which prevailed over the logistic effect of isolation and the negative effect on the mental status of mothers.",

Research demonstrates that if families receive specific and detailed information about the science of human milk, families will make the decision to provide milk for their children (60) . It is not enough to only teach the pregnant woman about breastfeeding. Her partner or support person, as well as family members should also be taught the science of human milk and the physiology of lactation. In order to achieve this goal, the current practice paradigm for prenatal care must be dramatically changed (61) . Families need to be educated on the science of human milk and the physiology of lactation. Health care providers must educate families that milk production begins at 16 weeks of gestation, so as long as breasts are present, milk is being produced. Health care providers must conduct thorough prenatal lactation risk assessment and should help families understand risk factors that may influence development of milk supply (62) . In addition, families who have risk factors such as breast surgery or abnormal breast tissue development should receive appropriate guidance to facilitate achievement of maximal milk supply after birth (63) . Health care professionals should provide parents with appropriate prenatal anticipatory guidance and support a proactive management strategy after birth to ensure that a copious milk supply in achieved (61) . Group prenatal care (centering model) by midwives as well as the use of doulas in breastfeeding guidance pre-and post-birth would be powerful interventions to improve breastfeeding outcomes (60, 64) . Early SSC and direct breastfeeding should always be the priority. With the staff reductions in maternity services, the lack of access to lactation professionals, and early hospital discharge, families need to receive appropriate anticipatory prenatal guidance. Moreover, maternity hospital practices facilitating breastfeeding, such as rooming-in, should be implemented overcoming the well-known constraints and following the narrative suggestions from mothers (65) .",

Otherwise, the gap in knowledge leads to fear-based confusion, misinformation, and the amplified risk of breastfeeding cessation despite the well-documented benefits of human milk and breastfeeding. Following the immediate and rigorous safety evaluation performed by a mobilized human milk research community, human milk has been shown to provide an immense opportunity to help combat the current COVID-19 pandemic threat. It is of paramount importance that we continue to use the growing evidence base in order to prioritize the use of human milk and breastfeeding. Utilization of the models that focus on informed decision making, initiation and maintenance of milk supply, SSC, and direct breastfeeding have demonstrated significant increases in human milk rates at discharge and beyond (67) (68) (69) . We need to improve equal access for all families to ensure the maintenance and growth of evidence-based lactation education and care during the course of the COVID-19 pandemic and indeed, beyond.",
