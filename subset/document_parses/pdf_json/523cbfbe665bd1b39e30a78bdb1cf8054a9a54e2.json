This study aimed to evaluate pain intensity, depression, and anxiety status in chronic pain patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. A total of 110 patients with chronic pain participated on a voluntary basis in this questionnaire survey. The questionnaire form elicited information on sociodemographic characteristics and prepandemic and pandemic data on analgesic need, access to medication, visual analog scale (VAS) pain, Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), and Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) scores. The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in increased levels of depression (74.5%), anxiety (66.4%), increase in analgesic need (60%), and limited access to analgesic drugs (40.0%). In conclusion, our findings revealed significant increase in VAS pain intensity, BDI, and BAI scores during the COVID-19 pandemic compared with prepandemic period among chronic pain patients, particularly for patients with increased need of analgesics during pandemic.",

            "text": "Chronic pain, defined as persistent or recurrent pain lasting more than 3 months or beyond the normal tissue healing (Merskey, 1986) , is considered as an increasingly prevalent medical problem and the leading cause of disability globally with significant economic and social burden (Fayaz et al., 2016; Li et al., 2020; Mills et al., 2019) . Chronic pain has detrimental impact on quality of life in relation to frequent experience of disability, emotional imbalances, and social isolation, whereas comorbid anxiety and mood disorders are also common among patients with chronic pain causing complex biopsychosocial interactions (Goesling et al., 2013; Hylands-White et al., 2017; Li et al., 2020; Puntillo et al., 2020) . Notably, these features are more exacerbated during the COVID-19 pandemic, whereas there is also a limited access to multimodal therapeutic modalities (i.e., algology interventions, physiotherapy, and psychotherapy) and inability to continue close coordination between patients and physicians, which are all essential for the appropriate management of chronic pain (El-Tallawy et al., 2020; Galea et al., 2020; Javed et al., 2020; Li et al., 2020; Puntillo et al., 2020) . Hence, chronic pain patients are considered particularly vulnerable in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, given the challenges in effective pain management and high risk of adverse health outcomes in relation to limited access to appropriate medical management (El-Tallawy et al., 2020; Galea et al., 2020; Javed et al., 2020; Li et al., 2020; Licciardone and Pandya, 2020; Puntillo et al., 2020) . However, limited data are available for real-world impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on chronic pain patients (Al-Hashel and Ismail, 2020; El-Tallawy et al., 2020; Li et al., 2020; Licciardone and Pandya, 2020; Puntillo et al., 2020) .",

Accordingly, the risk factors for pain morbidity and mortality and the potential for worsened chronic pain symptoms are considered to be amplified among chronic pain patients during the COVID-19 pandemic due to limited access to multimodal therapeutic modalities (i.e., pain management, physiotherapy, psychotherapy) and the concomitant psychosocial emotional stressors from the pandemic and socioeconomic circumstances (Abdallah and Geha, 2017; Javed et al., 2020; Puntillo et al., 2020) .",

The significant burden caused by the COVID-19 pandemic on health care systems worldwide caused redistribution of health care resources toward intensive care units and other COVID-19-dedicated sites, and thus many chronic pain services become stopped or interrupted, leaving chronic pain patient populations to be isolated with consequent social and psychological impact (Javed et al., 2020; Puntillo et al., 2020) . The negative impact of COVID-19 crisis on individuals living with longterm painful conditions is an important public health problem in terms of limitations in provision of uninterrupted pain management despite the amplification of other sources of stressors and pain ultimately worsening chronic pain (Javed et al., 2020; Karos et al., 2020) .",
