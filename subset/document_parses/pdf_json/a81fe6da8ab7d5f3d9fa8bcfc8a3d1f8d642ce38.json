            "text": "Successful formation of long-term declarative memory is influenced, among other things, by attention, emotion, and deviation from expectations. A unique form of expectation can be elicited through musical tension, evoked by the prolongation of certain musical progressions. We examined the effect that musical tension exerts on the formation of declarative memory, by composing three original music pieces that contained tension segments, achieved by delays in release from dominant to tonic harmonies. Music-evoked tension was validated using music information retrieval (MIR) analysis, as well as skin conductance response (SCR) measures. Indeed, tension-evoking musical excerpts were associated with heightened SCR, corroborated by increased subjective ratings of tension, as compared to neutral excerpts. In the main experiment, 50 participants listened to the three musical pieces while they were presented with unique images that were randomly assigned to four conditions: tension, tension-release, neutral music, and silence. One day later, their memory for the images was examined using a recognition test. We found that memory performance was enhanced for images presented during both neutral and tense music compared to silence. Moreover, we observed a tradeoff effect between post-experiment tension perception and memory, such that individuals who perceived musical tension as such displayed reduced memory performance for images encoded during musical tension, whereas tense music benefited memory for those with lower musical tension perception. Understanding the interrelations between musical components, which exert powerful and fundamental responses in humans, and cognitive faculties, may provide insights as to the basic features of memory formation.",

The effects of musical stimuli on cognitive functions, however, are more complex and controversial. Musical stimuli provide a unique opportunity to study cognitive functions and their neuronal underpinnings, by examining the effects that musical properties exert on listeners while carrying out diverse cognitive tasks (Echaide et al., 2019; Lehne et al., 2014) . Musical experiences are unique in that depending on context, they may evoke a sense of abstract expectation, which awaits to be resolved into a more stable state (Leonard B. Meyer, 1961 ). In the current study, we set out to examine how the perception of musically induced tension, which is based on unresolved expectations, may affect the formation of declarative memories of visual stimuli.",

(1993) claimed that listening to Mozart's music is directly correlated with the activation of neurons involved in spatial tasks, thus leading to noticeable improvements in visuospatial task performance. Conversely, other studies were not able to establish significant influences of background music on cognitive performance (Anderson & Fuller, 2010; Freeburne & Fleischer, 1952; Thompson et al., 2011) . While empirical evidence on the relationship between music and visual memory is scarce, several studies have been conducted on the relationship between listening to music and memory with regards to verbal items (i.e. Ferreri et al., 2015; Iwanaga & Ito, 2002; J\u00e4ncke & Sandmann, 2010; Kang & Williamson, 2014; Woo & Kanachi, 2005) . Findings from these studies are indecisive as well; some results point to a positive effect of listening to music on source memory (Ferreri et al., 2015; Ludke et al., 2014; Simmons-stern et al., 2010) , whereas others (e.g., J\u00e4ncke & Sandmann, 2010) did not find such an effect. Thus, the exact mechanisms underlying the relationship between background music and learning, if any, are still largely unknown.",

            "text": "Two plausible models regarding the effect that background music may have on learning were previously suggested. The first, adopted from Kahneman's \"cognitive capacity model\" (Kahneman, 1975) maintains that incoming cues compete for attention, such that the processing of any part of the incoming stimuli will come at the expense of performance relating to other stimuli. Thus, when multiple stimuli are simultaneously present, individuals will automatically divide their attentional resources, which may consume more cognitive resources that could be otherwise allocated to the main task. The usage of background music on top of a learning task can thus grab the performer's attention, and consequently distract them from learning (Proverbio et al., 2015) . In this sense, background music can be described as a \"seductive detail\" (Lehmann & Seufert, 2017; Rey, 2012) . This suggestion was supported by studies showing that background music impeded learning of a new motor task (Miskovic et al., 2008) and driving performance (North & Hargreaves, 1999) . Although previous research on the interaction between background music and memory in general is limited (Lehmann & Seufert, 2017) , according to this view, background music is likely to interfere with the primary cognitive task, thereby diminishing overall behavioral/ cognitive performance.",

It is well established that music is a powerful tool for inducing emotions (Carr & Rickard, 2016; Gabrielsson, 2001) , affecting physiological responses, including skin conductivity, heart rate, and other autonomic signatures (Baumgartner et al., 2006; Ellis & Simons, 2005; Grewe et al., 2009; Salimpoor et al., 2009) . Given that memory formation is dramatically affected by emotional states (Cahill & McGaugh, 1998; Labar, 2007) , it can be hypothesized that music may affect learning and memory via emotional responses. Indeed, emotionally arousing background music has been shown to enhance visual memory (Carr & Rickard, 2016; Proverbio et al., 2015) . The effects of music on memory are, however, highly influenced by the type of music employed. For instance, music that is enjoyable for the listener is likely to improve performance of cognitive tasks (Husain et al., 2002; Thompson et al., 2011) . This hypothesis has been supported by several studies showing that background music can improve both verbal memory encoding (Ferreri et al., 2013) and autobiographical memory in patients suffering from Alzheimer's disease (El Haj et al., 2015) , and that verbal and visual processing speed are improved when listening to background music (Angel et al., 2010) . Nevertheless, arousal is not always beneficial for learning, as excessive arousal is associated with anxiety, which is harmful to learning (Lehmann & Seufert, 2017) and is likely to result in memory impairment under certain circumstances (Kenya & Vuyiya, 2020; Kizilbash et al., 2002) .",

            "text": "A ubiquitous component in the experience of music is that of tension, which is often evoked by chords that within a particular context instill an unresolved sensation, which creates an expectation towards resolution to a more stable chord (Bigand et al., 1996; Leonard B. Meyer, 1961; Portabella & Toro, 2020) . Since musical stimuli typically lack actual negative real-life implications, these \"tense\" experiences, which may otherwise be considered negative, can be experienced as positive and rewarding, as part of the aesthetic experience (Lehne & Koelsch, 2015) . Among the most common and strongest harmonic progressions is the movement of the dominant chord (V) to its resolution in the tonic chord (I). Within the paradigm of classical tonal music, this harmonic progression (from V to I) is considered a stereotypical component in many familiar musical passages (Bigand & Parncutt, 1999) . Upon delays in release, tension will likely reach its peak, and the listener will wait for the outcome to take place. Thus, prolonged delays create longer and more intense periods of tension (Huron, 2006, p.314) . Examples of delayed tension release can be found in diverse musical genres and eras, from classical musicians (e.g., Chopin's Nocturne in C sharp minor, first two bars) to popular composers such as Freddie Mercury. In Bohemian Rhapsody (Queen), for example (in secs 0:45 and 5:27), the composer sustains the fifth dominant chord, which causes tension that is released by resolving on the tonic chord. It is noteworthy that the delay effect increases the more a specific outcome is expected. Hence, any intentional prolonged delays in these types of \"predictable\" musical passages are expected to be correlated with increasing states of tension in comparison to passages with minimal or no delays. The means by which musical tension may affect declarative memory formation are, however, not well established.",

In this manner, when the delayed resolution is played, the participants may compare the novel stimulus with the previous presentation.

During the experiment, participants were presented with unique images while listening to the musical pieces. One day later, their memory was examined using a memory recognition test.

The musical pieces contained both harmonic tension with immediate release (no delay, neutral condition) and harmonic tension with delayed resolution (tension condition). Harmonic tension was evoked by using dominant seventh chords, which typically evoke a sense of prediction by eliciting expectations regarding future (musical) events (Bigand et al., 1996) . The pieces were composed in such a manner that non-experienced musicians were also likely to experience this \"anticipatory\" sensation; this is achieved by playing a musical phrase twice, first devoid of resolution delays, and once again with delaying the release from tension (see Fig. S2 , OSM). In the first presentation of the musical phrase, a representation of the expected resolution is acquired, such that when the delayed resolution is played, the participants may compare the novel stimulus with the previous presentation. The tension chords were followed by a Root Chord, which served to resolve, or release, the previously elicited tension (Huron, 2006; Meyer, 1956) . Importantly, the neutral and the suspenseful musical conditions did not differ in terms of rhythm, tempo, or harmony. These elements were kept similar, and the only substantial difference was in the temporal delays of the harmonic resolution in each condition.",

This enabled us to quantify the decay time (in seconds), within which each pre-defined event type was presented (\"tension,\" \"neutral,\" and \"tension release\"). We also computed mean amplitudes (the music's volume) for each condition by creating an envelope from the waveform and extracting the relevant positive values. In addition, we used the mirnovelty function to characterize the transitions between successive states in the music throughout. This feature is computed by using a self-similarity analysis approach, comparing local configurations along the diagonal of a cross-correlation matrix in an unsupervised manner (Foote & Cooper, 2003) . Applying a kernel size of 400 frames, the algorithm created a novelty curve, representing transitions between successive changes in music properties.

In Stage2, participants were asked to rate the degree to which they felt musical tension for short musical excerpts that were selected from the three musical pieces conveyed during Stage1, each either containing musical tension or not. Participants were asked to rate their felt-tension for each excerpt on a scale from 1 to 5. Following this, Stage3 included a questionnaire, in which participants were asked to answer questions that gauged their musical background. Indeed, musical excerpts with tension, characterized by prolonged delays in melodic resolution, were associated with increased subjective ratings of suspense as compared to neutral excerpts. Three out of the 22 participants were excluded from the analysis since they did not show any significant SCR measurements. 1 The analysis of SCR data consisted of down-sampling the data from 500 Hz to 10 Hz (in order to reduce computational load).

Participants were requested to rate their perceived tension for each excerpt on a scale from 1 (no tension perceived at all) to 5 (high perceived tension). Importantly, the tension rating task was performed only after the learning and test stages of the experiment had ended, since we did not wish participants to be explicitly aware of the research question regarding the effects of tension on memory, which might lead to biases in learning and memory performance. For each participant, we calculated a subjective tension perception score, defined as the difference between average perceived-tension for the tension excerpts minus average perceived tension for the neutral excerpts. In a subsequent analysis, this score was correlated with memory performance indices, as described below. In addition, a post-experiment questionnaire was administered in order to assess participants' musical background. This questionnaire was adapted from the music background questionnaire (Zhao et al., 2012) . Although none of the participants were professional musicians, this questionnaire provided information regarding the individuals' experience with music through factors such as engagement with music, hours spent listening to music, etc.",

To validate the musical conditions and their relation to memory performance, we applied a music information retrieval (MIR) approach to extract meaningful features from the composed musical pieces, with an emphasis on decay times and musical novelty (Lartillot et al., 2008) . Decay times refer to the time-periods in seconds between successive peaks and troughs of amplitudes as detected by the MIR software, and novelty denotes transitions between successive musical states (see Methods). Figure 2 depicts the results of the MIR analysis for one of the three musical pieces (the results for all the music pieces are shown in Fig. S1 , OSM). The amplitude waveform of musical piece #1 is shown along with vertical lines that correspond to the times and musical condition in which the visual images were displayed. Musical tension was designed here to contain prolonged dominant harmonies, and indeed, mean decay lengths (as detected using the MIR toolbox) were longest surrounding images of the predefined tension condition (mean \u00b1 SE = 8.26 \u00b1 2.37 s), followed by tension release (1.89 \u00b1 0.41 s) and neutral music (0.89 \u00b1 0.18 s) (Fig. 2D) . A oneway ANOVA revealed a significant difference in the decay times of the different conditions (F(2,19) = 5.58, P = 0.012), stemming from longer decays in the tension versus neutral and tension versus tension release conditions (P < 0.05, Bonferroni corrected for multiple comparisons). As In contrast, novelty values (indicating meaningful transitions in musical elements) were similar during times of tension and neutral music, but were significantly higher during release from tension (0.31 \u00b1 0.04, 0.28 \u00b1 0.03, and 0.53 \u00b1 0.06, for tension, neutral, and tension release, respectively, F(2,21) = 3.47, P = 0.05).

Using the ROCtoolbox (Koen et al., 2017) , we computed ROC curves for each participant and each condition (see Fig. S4 , OSM), and extracted the AUC as an index of memory performance for different confidence criteria. A repeated-measures ANOVA of AUC across musical conditions yielded a significant effect (F(3,144) = 11.53, P < 0.0001, see Fig. 3B ).

These results are presented in Table S1 (OSM). In order to assess for possible influences of musical training on the demonstrated relationship between perceived tension and memory performance, we carried out two regression analyses, with either tension-related d' or AUC as dependent variables, and differential tension perception and musical background (categorical yes/no) as independent variables. As expected, for both d' and AUC, the slopes of the perceived tension variable were significant (beta values for perceived tension were significant at P < 0.05 for d' and P < 0.01 for AUC). In contrast, the slopes of the musical background did not reach significance (P = 0.34 and P = 0.118, respectively).

Moreover, perception of memory tension was negatively correlated with memory performance, such that the higher the perception of tension, the lower the memory performance (as indexed by d' and AUC measures) for images presented during musical tension, as compared to the baseline of neutral music. We applied music information retrieval (MIR) analysis to validate the predefined tension condition, and confirmed that this condition differed from tension release and neutral periods only in decay times (indicative of the prolongation of dominant V chords), and not in amplitude (volume) or musical novelty. We also confirmed that musical tension yielded enhanced skin-conductance responses as compared to neutral music. Overall, tension perception seems to act as a mediator between musical tension and its interference with memory performance. Participants who do not detect musical tension are more successful in forming memories for images while listening to tense music, compared to listening to neutral music or silence. These findings are discussed in light of the cognitive capacity model and the arousal-mood hypothesis, as they relate to musical perception and cognition.",

The results of the current study show that memory performance for visual stimuli is enhanced when the stimuli are encoded in the presence of music, whether the music expresses tension or neutral features, in comparison to silence. All participants were unfamiliar with the music they heard during learning, a feature that enabled us to control for any familiarity effects, which were previously shown to interfere with participants' performance (B\u00fcdenbender & Kreutz, 2016; Chew et al., 2016; Parente, 1976) . It should be noted that only a handful of previous studies, which assessed the effects of background music on learning, made use of music that was specifically composed for the experimental intervention (de la Mora Velasco & Hirumi, 2020a). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that uses original background music to investigate its effects on declarative memory for images. Pertaining to musical training, participants varied in their musical background, but none of them were professional musicians. This fact might have contributed to the general positive effect that the background music exerted, as previous studies have pointed to a negative impact of background music on musicians in comparison to non-musicians, such that professional musicians seem to consume more cognitive resources in analyzing musical properties, as they are more sensitive to tonal structures (Morrison et al., 2003; Patston & Tippett, 2011) .",

In the tension condition, one chord was prolonged (the dominant fifth), such that in effect, the listener heard a sustained prolongation of the previous chord until tension was released. According to the classical music paradigm, harmonic progressions are interpreted according to their local context, within which the tonal function of particular chords can be determined as creating tension (Bigand & Parncutt, 1999) . On the perceptual level, the different contexts of these conditions lead to different experiences. Based on the law of good continuation (Gestalt Psychology), as it applies to musical stimuli, expectations that arise from delays in musical phrases will yield an affective response, unless the process is rationalized on a conscious level (Meyer, 1956, p.88) . Therefore, in contrast to the silence condition, the tension condition is accompanied by an expectation, which is resolved only upon the release from tension. In our study, the musical tension condition, which was characterized by minimal musical stimuli, yielded overall superior memory formation in comparison to silence, stressing the importance of musical context on cognitive performance.",

            "text": "The observation that the presence of music was associated with increased visual memory as compared to silence is in line with the arousal-mood hypothesis (Husain et al., 2002) . According to this hypothesis, listening to music can affect both physiological arousal and emotional feelings, which may in turn influence cognitive performance in diverse ways (Thompson et al., 2001) . In a related study, Bezdek et al. (2017) dissociated between suspense related to the content of selected movie segments and suspense related to background music. They found that the former, but not the latter, increased accuracy for memory recall of movie details. Here we show that musical stimuli, both with and without delays in tension-release, benefit memory formation, as compared to silence. On top of this relationship, we demonstrate a weakening in memory formation for participants who perceive tension music as such, compared to the neutral music condition, and a memory facilitation effect when tension is present in the music but not necessarily perceived as such. This negative correlation between tension perception and memory formation implies that beyond the overall arousing effect that music exerts on listeners' performance, the perception of specific musical features mediates memory performance. According to the seductive detail effect (Rey, 2012) , interesting but otherwise irrelevant information to a given task, such as background music, can grab attention resources and consequently impede learning (Lehmann & Seufert, 2017) . This is also in line with the cognitive capacity model, as learners have to invest more cognitive resources to process background music on top of the primary cognitive task (Deutsch, 2013) . Mirroring this effect, individuals who do not perceive tension show a facilitating influence of tension on encoding. This raises the possibility that tension conveyed by music elicits an automatic emotional response, thus aiding encoding.",

Musical tension in the current experiment was elicited by prolonging delays in harmonic resolutions (postponing the root chord that is expected to succeed the dominant chord). Future studies may consider using other musical characteristics known to induce tension, such as changes in tempo, dissonance, and rhythm. The effect that musical expertise may have on cognitive performance while listening to music remains unresolved. In the current study, musical training or activity (as assessed by the music background questionnaire) did not correlate with tension-perception. Similar findings were previously reported, providing evidence that musicians and non-musicians do not differ in their ratings of musical tension for single chords (Lahdelma & Eerola, 2020) , sequences of chords (Bigand & Parncutt, 1999) , or prolonged musical pieces (Fredrickson, 2000) . Since none of our participants were professional musicians, and given the above, it is not surprising that the degree of musicality or training did not correlate with tension perception. Although little is known regarding the interaction between musical expertise and the effects of music on cognition (de la Mora Velasco & Hirumi, 2020b), our results are in line with previous research showing that participants with musical background do not necessarily perform better in memory tasks related to visual stimuli (Talamini et al., 2017) .",

Additionally, future studies are necessary for examining whether this interfering effect of music on memory formation can be found in musical features other than tension.
