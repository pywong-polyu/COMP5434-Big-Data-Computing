Compressed sensing results can be used to provably detect a small number of infected persons among a possibly large number of people. There are several advantages of this method compared to classical group testing. Firstly, it is non-adaptive and thus possibly faster to perform than adaptive methods which is crucial in exponentially growing pandemic phases. Secondly, due to nonnegativity of measurements and an appropriate noise model, the compressed sensing problem can be solved with the non-negative least absolute deviation regression (NNLAD) algorithm. This convex tuning-free program requires the same number of tests as current state of the art group testing methods. Empirically it performs significantly better than theoretically guaranteed, and thus the highthroughput, reducing the number of tests to a fraction compared to other methods. Further, numerical evidence suggests that our method can correct sparsely occurring errors.",

In later stages of a pandemic regular testing of large groups of mostly healthy people is a common policy to prevent further outbreaks [2] [3] . This results in a strong desire to reduce the number of tests required to identify infected elements among a group of individuals. This approach is often called pooling and has been intensively investigated for COVID-19, see for example [4, 5, 6] . The mathematical field group testing is concerned with this problem and has therefore also gained interest recently again. It was invented by Dorfman [7] , however for a general overview we refer to [8] . The methods from classical group testing often suffer from several drawbacks including slowness due to adaptivity of the tests [9] and sensitivity to errors [10] .",

However, our approach is non-adaptive and has rigorous recovery bounds showing robustness to noise. Numerically we see that our method has empirically further advantages, including error correcting properties.

According to the information theoretic lower bound we require at least ln N S tests to find the infected individuals. The binary splitting algorithm finds the S infected individuals with a number of tests in the order of S log 2 (N/S). However, since the tests are adaptive, each subsequent test is designed depending on the outcome of previous tests, and thus each test has to wait for the result of previous once. If the time to perform a test is large, it might be desirable to perform multiple tests at once. In such cases non-adaptive methods are preferable. There are many deterministic non-adaptive methods for group testing. Most of these prove their results using disjunct matrices. For instance, in [16] a non-adaptive group testing method is presented whose number of tests is in the order of S 2 log 2 (N )/log 2 (S).",

We collect specimens from N individuals arranged into a vector x \u2208 R N , and the amount of viruses in the specimen of the n-th individual is denoted by the non-negative quantity x n \u2208 N \u222a {0} \u2282 R. We assume that the viruses are evenly distributed in each specimen, meaning that if we take \u03b1 \u2208 [0, 1] of the volume of the specimen of the n-th individual, it will contain roughly \u03b1x n viruses. We denote the number of non-zeros in a vector z by z 0 . Since, S individuals are infected we have x 0 = S. Let the sample of the m-th test contains a fraction of A m,n of the amount of specimen of the n-th individual. The sample of the m-th test thus contains, up to rounding errors, the amount of viruses n\u2208[N ] A m,n x n = (Ax) m , where A is an M \u00d7 N matrix with entries A m,n \u2208 [0, 1] with column sums of at most one. The amount of tests is thus M . Often one makes the assumption that x is a random vector with iid. elements, for instance a Poisson random variable multiplied by a Bernoulli random variable with parameter p = S N . Instead we take it here as deterministic unknown. A quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) [17] can be used to generate an estimate y m of the amount of viruses in the m-th test (Ax) m . This procedure is not accurate and errors e m := y m \u2212 (Ax) m might occur. We try to recover the amount of viruses in the specimen of the individuals according to",

This testing design described above is a special compressed sensing task where the elements of the matrix A and the unknown sparse vector x are nonnegative. For non-negative A standard proof techniques like the restricted isometry property does not succeed out of the box in this regime and instead one has to use tools like the null space property defined in Section 4. For example, it is known that matrices with independent and uniformly on {0, 1} distributed entries achieve the optimal scaling [18] . However, deterministic, i.e. non-random, construction of matrices with a null space property is a delicate, open problem. To the best of the authors knowledge the best deterministic construction of binary compressed sensing matrices is [19, Theorem 3.5] , which generates expander graphs that are sufficient for compressed sensing according to [11, Chapter 13] . In particular for any \u03b1 > 0 there exists a constant C \u03b1 such that the matrix has only M \u2264 C \u03b1 S 1+\u03b1 (log 2 (N ) log 2 (S)) 2+ 2 \u03b1 rows. The downside of this result is that the constant C \u03b1 is rather large for small \u03b1 and thus other explicit constructions often achieve a smaller number of tests, since the dimensions for viral detection might be rather limited.",

The noise vector in (1) is non-zero in general, since the estimate is affected by some errors including, rounding errors and inaccuracy of the qPCR. In [14] the noise vector is modeled as a heavy tailed random variable depending on the unknown quantity Ax. Therefore, it is difficult to apply recovery methods from compressed sensing for independent additive noise out of the box. Parameter tuning, using e.g. cross validation, is often crucial at this point. Interestingly, non-negativity helps with such noise models. Combining the heavy-tailed noise model with non-negativity of data, we arrived at a conclusion that the best is to use the parameter tuning free Non-negative Absolute Deviation Regression (NNLAD) for recovery which is any minimizer",

Finally, given a certain threshold \u01eb one declares the individual n to be infected if x # n > \u01eb.

Many adaptive group testing methods require half as much tests as our method, but ours the advantage that it only requires one stage and can thus be performed faster. We shortly demonstrate an advantage of the NNLAD approach to other compressed sensing decoders in a short experiment with synthetic data. Following Theorem 4.5 for Q = 31 and S = 7, we are guaranteed to detect up to 7 infected people among 961 by using 248 tests. However, empirically the identification will succeed even if more than 7 individuals are infected and even if multiple measurements are corrupted. In Figure (1) we vary the prevalence p = and plot the probability that the NNLAD estimator x # is sufficiently close to the true signal x in the \u2113 1norm. We see that as guaranteed by Theorem 4.5 the recovery succeeds for p =",
