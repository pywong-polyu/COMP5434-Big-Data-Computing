The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has shown the succession or superposition of epidemics linked to numerous viral variants [2] . Until recently, the overall rate of reinfection 2 with SARS-CoV-2 has been relatively low, below 2% according to several international studies [3] , [4] . The Omicron (B.1.1.529) variant has been described for the first time on November 2021 in Gauteng province, South Africa and spread rapidly worldwide. One study conducted in South Africa demonstrated that it was associated with an increased hazard ratio of reinfection, suggesting its substantial ability to evade immunity from prior infection [5] . In addition, vaccine efficacy against this variant was reported to be reduced to around 56% for the Pfizer vaccine [6] .",

We thus have a cohort of patients screened and diagnosed as infected for the period February 27, 2020-March 6, 2022, making it possible to calculate the rate of reinfections over this entire period without the bias of variable screening strategy or capacity. An automatic reinfection detection system has been implemented through the laboratory information system of our institute's laboratory, on the basis of two qPCR-positive samples spaced at least 90 days apart with a negative qPCR between two episodes, according to the CDC definition of reinfection case [https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019ncov/php/invest-criteria.html]. SARS-CoV-2 RNA genotyping was performed by using sequencing or variant-specific qPCR, as described elsewhere [3] . previous assessment that this estimated risk decreased over time [3] , we observed little variation, between 2.4 and 3.0%, in this updated study. This is likely because of cumulative numbers of reinfections overtime with occurrence of new cases of reinfection that were diagnosed after our previous assessment.",

Our recent observations of a lower severity of infections with the Omicron variants as indicated by low rates of hospitalization, transfer to intensive care units, and death is good news in this context [9], [10] . The Omicron variant is likely distantly related to other SARS-CoV-2 variants which may account for a higher rate on reinfection and lower efficacy of vaccines. Indeed, despite the currently considerable proportions of people vaccinated and/or infected in France, present data and recently published data [5] suggest that resulting immunity could not prevent an endemicization of SARS-CoV-2.",

            "text": "February 7, 2020 to March 6, 2022, 1,646 of 80,863 patients found SARS-CoV-2positive experienced a reinfection. Their mean age \u00b1 standard deviation at time of the second infection was 38.3 \u00b1 16.4 years, ranging from 9 months to 97 years, and 60.1% were female. In Marseille, we observed five major epidemics of SARS-CoV-2 infections due to different mid-June 2020 to February 2021 was due to multiple variants among which the 20A (B.1.416, a.k.a. Marseille-1 [7] variant, the 20A.EU2 (B.1.160, a.k.a Marseille-4) variant, the majority one, and the 20E.EU1 (B.1.117, a.k.a. Marseille-2) variant. The third epidemic during March 2021-June 2021 was mainly due to the Alpha (20I, B.1.1.7) variant. The Delta (B.1.617.2) variant was the one mostly responsible for the fourth epidemic that lasted from July 2021 to early November 2021. Finally, the fifth epidemic, due to the Omicron (B.1.1.529) variant, started in November 2021 and is still going on as of March 6, 2022. Reinfection cases were observed since the second epidemic among patients whose first infection occurred during one of the five epidemics (Figure 1). The overall mean time span between first infection and reinfection was 334 \u00b1 146 days and significantly increased overtime from one epidemic to another (Supplementary Figure). The first patient reinfected with the Omicron variant was detected mid-December. Then, this variant rapidly became predominant in reinfected patients until the study's endpoint, as of 6 March 2022, with 885 cases out of 1,397 (Figure 1). In earlier studies, we reported that the prevalence of reinfection among SARS-CoV-2 infections diagnosed in our institute was 0.2% (58/29,154 cases), 0.3% (41/12,283 cases) and 1.5% (110/7,152 cases) during the second, third and fourth epidemic (until 24 August 2021), respectively[3],[8]. In the present study, we confirm a 1.5% reinfection rate (179/12,135 cases) during the entire fourth epidemic (until November 2021), and observe a marked increase in the reinfection rate that reaches 6.8% (1,397/20,542 cases) during the on-going fifth epidemic (Figure 2). Among 13,060 cases of first infections with the Omicron variant, 10,590 were due to the Omicron BA.1 variant (81.1%) and 2470 (18.9%) to the BA.1 variant and 51 (5.8%) to the BA.2 variant. There were no cases of first infection with the BA.1 variant that were reinfected with the BA.2 variant.",
