All patients aged above 18 years, who were hospitalized with clinical symptoms of COVID-19 for more than a night and had positive RT-PCR test results (7) or typical COVID-19 CT scan findings (according to the benchmarks of Society of Radiology) (8) , were included in this study.

The collected data encompassed demographic information, comorbidity, home medication, clinical symptoms, initial laboratory, CT scan findings, and outcomes (i.e., intubation, admission to ICU, length of stay in ICU, length of stay in the ward, and fatality rate). In this regard, the patients who died immediately after intubation were classified as nonintubated. The primary objective of this study was to compare the clinical and paraclinical symptoms among three young, middle-aged, and elderly groups, and the secondary objective of the research was to evaluate the outcomes in these three groups.",

In the Cox model, the young group was considered the reference group, and the hazard ratio was estimated in comparison with each of the other categories ( Table 5 ). The first model was a raw model for all the outcomes. Although the estimated hazard ratios were not significant, admission to the ICU and fatality rate in the middle-aged group were 29% and 27% higher than those ratios in the young group, respectively. However, the intubation rate in the middle-aged group was 66% less than that in the young group. The hazard ratio of admission to ICU in the middle-aged to young groups was 0.96%. The outcomes of fatality and intubation in the elderly group increased by 0.06% and 0.82%, respectively, compared to the young group. The effect of gender and main variables (in the groups of contact variables, vital symptoms, comorbidities, and biochemistry parameters) on the desired outcome was eliminated in the second to fourth models. Although the results were not significant in the fourth model, the hazard ratios of the length of stay in the hospital were 1.10 and 3.27 in the elderly and middle-aged groups compared to the young group, respectively. Moreover, the hazard ratios of fatality rate in the middle-aged and elderly groups were 1.65 and 2.40 times higher than those in the young group, respectively. The hazard ratio of intubation in the middle-aged group decreased by 25% compared to the young group; however, the difference was not statistically significant. In contrast, as a statistically non-significant finding, the hazard ratio of intubation in the elderly group was 4.8 times higher than that in the young group.",

On the other hand, the length of stay in ICU decreased by about two days with increasing age in each age group, at a statistically nonsignificant value. These results are reported in Table 5 in the form of four fitted models. The first model did not adjust the effect of any of the variables. In the three other models, the effects of gender and significant variables on contact variables, vital symptoms, comorbidities, and biochemistry parameters were adjusted in the three groups, respectively. (2, (9) (10) (11) (12) . The prevalence of SARS and MERS infections was also higher among men (13, 14) . (15) (16) (17) . Different fever prevalence may be due to differences in the mean ages of the studied population or in the days of fever screening. It can be predicted that the lower prevalence of fever in the elderly due to underlying diseases or weakened immune probably are the nature of the disease and the excessive secretion of inflammatory cytokines (19) .",

Almost half of the patients complained of fatigue and myalgia, and this was more frequent in this study compared to the statistics of other studies (2, 10, 18). However, there was no significant difference among different age groups in this regard. Fatigue-inducing factors such as anemia, depression, comorbidities, nutritional problems, and vitamin deficiencies are more common in the elderly.

Although an increase in the ESR levels can be justified by increased age, elevated CRP levels in the elderly may indicate more inflammation. Some studies have also documented that the CRP levels were higher in the elderly than in other groups(16). According to our findings, among the inflammatory factors, increased ferritin levels in all groups and increased CRP in the elderly are acceptable markers to determine the severity of inflammation in patients with COVID-19.According to our findings, the CT scan involvement in the middle-aged group was more extended than that in the young and elderly groups. Moreover, consolidation and GGO lesions varied across age groups. Since one of the factors leading to lesion densification on the CT scan is the body's response to the virus, consolidation lesions were probably more common in the young patients, and the GGO pattern was more observed in the elderly(23). The higher prevalence of pleural effusion in the elderly can be due to concomitant diseases such as heart failure (Table 4).In this study, 53 patients died (8%), while other studies have reported different Coronavirus mortality rates (3.8%-28%)(2,9). Although in our study population, 10.26% of individuals aged above 65 years old and 3.8% of young individuals died, there was no significant difference among the research groups. Most studies have concluded that aging is a mortality predictor in COVID-19 patients(9,10,21). Although this finding was also achieved in the present study, the difference was not significant in this regard. This lack of statistical significance can be due to unequal sample sizes.",
