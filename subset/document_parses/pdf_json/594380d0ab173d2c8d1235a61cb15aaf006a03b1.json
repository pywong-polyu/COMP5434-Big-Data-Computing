Recently, ultra-wideband (UWB) radios emerged as a more accurate alternative that nonetheless exhibits a significantly higher energy consumption, limiting in-field studies. In this paper, we leverage a novel approach, embodied by the Janus system that combines these radios by exploiting their complementary benefits. The very accurate proximity data gathered in-field by Janus, once augmented with several metadata, unlocks unprecedented levels of information, enabling the development of novel multi-level risk analyses.",

The wide variety of performed daily activities induced multiple individual behaviors, allowing a rich investigation of social environments from the contagion risk perspective. We consider risk based on duration and proximity of contacts and classify interactions according to different risk levels. We can then evaluate the summer camps' organization, observe the effect of partition in small groups, or social bubbles, and identify the organized activities that mitigate the riskier behaviors.",

In our experiments, we configured Janus to acquire distance measurements every 30 s and installed it on a wearable device that children can easily carry. We have collected real-world CPIs with Janus at three summer camps in the province of Trento (Italy). These camps offer interesting settings because of the rich variety of daily activities that induce different CPIs among children and between children and the summer camps' educators. Moreover, the summer camps took place during the summer of 2020, in the middle of the pandemic and just after the local easing of lockdown measures. As such, it is possible to investigate the effect of the guidelines and regulations enforcing physical distancing, mask-wearing, outdoor activities, and the formation of small groups (i.e., social bubbles).",

BLEnd defines the optimal schedules for the BLE advertisement and scan periods to minimize consumption while meeting a service level agreement defined by the maximum allowed latency to discovery, the required probability for discovery, and the maximum number of devices expected to be in range. In our in-field studies, we configured the BLEnd component of Janus to guarantee the discovery of a neighbor within 30 s at least 95% of the times, provided no more than 20 devices are in range.",

Janus relies on single-sided two-way ranging (SS-TWR), part of the IEEE 802.15.4 standard [45] . This scheme requires a 2-packet exchange between an initiator and a responder; the transmission and reception of these packets are timestamped and made available at the initiator, which can compute the time of flight and therefore the distance between devices. In Janus, each device periodically schedules a ranging window during which it is available to respond to ranging requests; the aforementioned coordination exploiting BLE advertisements informs each neighbor of its unique offset into this window, ensuring that ranging requests among multiple neighbors do not collide. Additional details about Janus are available in [36] . Figure 1 provides an example of the distance data directly obtained from Janus devices, which in our case are the MDEK1001 development kits by Decawave (now Qorvo), equipped with a BLE radio and the popular DW1000 UWB transceiver. The chart shows a snapshot of 105 minutes for device 2 with respect to two other devices, 6 and 7. Each dot indicates the distance measurement between device 2 and either device, color-coded as blue for device 6 and orange for device 7. According to our configuration, samples are taken every 30 s. Even without additional data processing, it can be easily seen that device 2 (and therefore the person carrying it) was very close (within 1 m) to device 6 for approximately 15 min, starting just after 11:00. We also note that the data is quite clean; the variations of the measurements across time are consistent. This is due to the accuracy of UWB, which enables our subsequent analysis.",

Following Italian regulations, all parents and educators signed an informed consent form. Special attention was given to privacy and data protection: no personal information was associated with the identifier of the corresponding Janus device. We did note the group (i.e., social bubble) the individual belonged to and, in some cases, the identity of devices carried by others for whom physical distancing rules were waived (e.g., among siblings and between children with special needs and the educators assigned to assist them). The first summer camp, am-pri, operated for half days (mornings) with 21 primary school-age children and 5 adult educators, all of whom agreed to participate in the study.

However, as pointed out by Jones et al. [54] , physical distancing rules would be more appropriate and effective if they offer graded levels of risk. Similarly, although contact tracing guidelines in several countries, various digital tracing contact apps, and some studies [56] assume that the duration of exposure to a person with COVID-19 influences the transmission risk (e.g., defining a threshold of 15 min beyond which transmission risk increases), a precise quantification of the duration of exposure is still missing [54] .",

This twostep strategy allows for an in-depth risk assessment and effective definition of the risk levels without requiring possibly intrusive and privacy-critical contextual information.

Therefore, it is possible that the analyzed population has heterogeneous behaviors, e.g., with only a few participants involved in more risky close proximity interactions and the majority of individuals interacting safely, or vice-versa. To understand how the risk is distributed among the summer camp population we consider three additional views, shown in Fig. 5 , where we examine the behavior for pairs of individuals. We report only the case of am-pri, since the other camps yielded analogous results. First, in Fig. 5(a) , we compute for each pair the average distance and duration across all the contacts, resulting in a single dot per pair. We observe that each pair interacts, on average, in low-risk social interactions. A similar result is observed in Fig. 5(b) , where we select the single contact per pair with the smallest proximity distance. Finally, Fig. 5(c) shows the single contact per pair with the longest duration. Here, we see that \u223c23% of the pairs of individuals are involved in very high-risk interactions. From this, we conclude that the risk of contagion is distributed quite homogeneously among the different pairs of individuals, except for some for which the longest interactions are also the most dangerous ones.",

Table 4 . The values in parentheses denote the percentage of time spent in a contact with the corresponding risk category As described in Sect. 3.2, each summer camp setting organized participants in small groups and in specific roles (educator, child). Groups are intended to keep participants separated into disjoint bubbles [37, 38] so that any contagion event would remain localized. On the other hand, roles reflect the internal organization of the summer camps, where both children and educators were present. The results are graphically reported in Fig. 6 , where the colored bars show the relative percentages of contacts for each risk level that can be attributed to child-child, educator-child, and educator-educator interactions, respectively. Moreover, these can be divided into interactions involving two people belonging to the same group (\"intra-group\") and those bridging two different groups (\"intergroup\"). Instead, the large grey bars in the background report the total percentages of contacts for each specific type of interaction, independently on the associated risk. To facilitate the quantitative comparison of the results, Table 5 reports, for each summer camp, the number and the total duration of the contacts in the six groups. When a contact occurs between two members of the same group, we assign to it the activity being performed at that moment by that group. In this way, we add another layer of analysis that allows us to study the relationship between the activity type, the number, and the contagion risk level of the contacts. The results are shown in Fig. 7 , where we report four bars for each activity, representing the four risk levels. The height of the bars represents the sum of the duration of all contacts during each activity divided by the total duration of the activity. Hence, each bar reports the risk per unit time of each activity. This normalization allows comparison across the different activities, independent of their duration. The percentages show the fraction of contact time within each risk level, for each activity.",

Note that in day-int there was only a single group. We observe, as expected, that intra-group contacts are more numerous, but they are also interpreted as less risky since they are foreseen and permitted within the social bubble policies. On the other hand, inter-group contacts happen across different groups and are generally more risky; however, their limited number is a good indication of the effectiveness of the application of the social bubble policies. The collected data thus confirm that in case of an epidemic spreading in these settings, most of the possible contagions would likely be restricted to a single group, and transmission to other groups would be avoided or limited. Focusing on the interactions within each group, we observe that the highest percentages of contacts with high or medium-high risk of contagion involve children (i.e., children-children or educator-children CPIs), while the educators tend to have low-risk interactions among them.",

This is actually by design as the activity duration is less than 15 min (Table 2) , which is the minimum duration required to mark a contact as high risk (Table 4) . We observe a similar finding in the other two data sets, day-pri and day-int (Figs. 7(b) and 7(c)), where \"lunch\" is the activity with the fewest risky contacts. This is probably because, during meal times, the children were not wearing their face masks; thus, the educators were paying more attention to the compliance to physical distancing rules. Moreover, the children were seated during lunch, so there was a reduced probability of accidental CPIs. Other low-risk activities in am-pri were \"crafts\", \"theater\" and \"team games\", all meticulously organized activities where the educators established precise rules for physical distancing to avoid CPIs. The risk rises instead with \"soccer\" and \"woods\", where no precise rules were established, and the children were free to move in a large space. Moreover, these activities took place outdoor, and there is evidence for a reduced transmission risk during outdoor activities as compared to indoor ones [62] [63] [64] [65] .",

In our analysis, for instance, some should preferably require the presence of stable pairs (e.g., \"newspaper\") and others should be moved outdoors (e.g., \"board games\").

Finally, a comparison to similar studies in the summer camp setting is not possible, as none are available in the literature. Moreover, we do not have hard ground truth to compare against; this would have required either cameras or manual annotations, which would have greatly interfered with the children privacy and the camps' activities.
