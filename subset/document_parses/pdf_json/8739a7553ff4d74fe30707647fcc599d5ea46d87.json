When a burn case is admitted to a health facility, medical data and images of the burned areas are delivered to the staff of the burn unit/center. After a quick evaluation (around two hours) of the patient using telemedicine, a decision is made for the most convenient burn unit/center for the patient to be transported to. Also, the means of transport (by land or air) is decided on depending on the clinical condition of the patient and the distance to the referral center. This algorithm is also useful during natural or manmade disasters to coordinate convenient transport of patients with multiple trauma. With the emergence of the pandemic, information about the patient's COVID-19 test results, suspicious contact history, presence of symptoms, and travel history abroad are also included in the algorithm to ensure that all necessary precautions are taken before the patient arrives at the burn center. The algorithm we employed during admittance and management of pediatric burn cases in our center is presented in Figure 1 . A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t During the initial evaluation and management of the patients in Group 1, a surgical mask, apron, and gloves were used in the standard fashion during wound care and medical treatments.

Maintaining the health service provided to patients with burn injuries during the pandemic presented additional risks for patients and health care professionals. During the COVID-19 pandemic, it has commonly been observed that more rapid spread and even outbreaks can emerge when proper precautions are not taken during patient admittance because transmission from asymptomatic patients to other patients and healthcare staff can occur. 13 Because of this concern, various precautions are recommended 2, 14 . Therefore, in accordance with the recommendations of the Infection Control Committee of our hospital, each admitted patient is regarded as a \"possible case\" and isolated until the PCR test result is obtained.",

The course of COVID-19 infection is more severe in patients with coexisting diseases, in immunosuppressed individuals, and in the elderly. Patients with burn injuries are also included in this high-risk group as they have a coexisting burn injury. 21 The rate of asymptomatic infection at admission was 4.0% in our cohort of patients. Although this rate may appear low, it is significant because patients treated in burn units/centers are in a high-risk group. During the study period, no patient-to-staff transmission of COVID-19 was demonstrated.",

Physical distancing, mask use, and hygiene principles should be strictly followed to prevent COVID-19 and other infections because the most common cause of death in burn patients is still infections. 23, 24 Prevention of transmission is still the best way to confront the COVID-19 pandemic since there are no effective drug treatments, and the success of vaccination programs, which have been initiated more recently, is unclear. 25 This is more pronounced for intensive care units and burn centers where nosocomial transmission may be faster and more lethal. 26 M a n u s c r i p t ",

Numerical variables (including age, length of hospital stay, and the other parameters) are given as mean (minimum-maximum; range). Categorical variables are given as percentages. Initially, the normality of the numerical variables was evaluated with a visual histogram and the Shapiro-Wilk test or Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Numerical variables with normal distribution were evaluated with Student's ttest, and variables that were not distributed normally were evaluated with the Mann-Whitney U test. Categorical variables were evaluated with the chi-square test. A p-value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant.ResultsDuring the study period, 101 patients were hospitalized in our burn center; 59 (58.4%) were boys and 42 (41.6%) were girls. During the same time period of the previous year (May-September 2019), 98 patients were hospitalized in our center. The mean age of the patientswas 4.5 (0.6-17.6; range 17.0) years. The most common cause was scalding (boiling water burn) (74.2%), while the remainder were flame, electricity, and chemical burn injuries (14.9%, 8.9%, and 2.0%, respectively). The mean TBSA of the patients was 12.0% (1.0-55.0%; range 54.0%). The burn depth was second degree in 86.1% of the patients and third degree in 2.0%, while the remaining 11.9% had second and third degree burns at the same time. The mean length of hospital stay was 13.2 (1.0-92.0; range 91.0) days(Table 1).Among the whole study group (n=101), 79 (78.2%) who had no history of travel abroad or .8%) who has one of these findings are enrolled in group 2. Four of the patients in Group 2 had a history of travel abroad, nine had a history of a suspicious contact, four had fever, three had diarrhea, and two had coughing. Among the whole cohort, the PCR test at the time of admittance was positive in four patients (4.0%, n=101). Two were in Group 1, and the other two were in Group 2. Both of the patients in Group 2 who had a positive PCR test also had a history of suspicious contact.Boys were significantly more common in Group 2 (p=0.042). No significant difference was observed between the groups in terms of age, length of stay, TBSA, number of tests performed, rate of PCR positivity upon admission, and cause of the burn injury (p=0.494, p=0.351, p=0.204, p=0.240, p=0.206, and p=0.921, respectively).",

Fever, which is commonly encountered during the clinical course of patients with burn injuries, is also a common finding of COVD-19 infection. All these additional concerns have significantly complicated the management process of patients with burn injuries in burn centers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Accordingly, we lowered the suspicion threshold for COVID-19 infection in our center and ran the necessary tests repeatedly (depending on the clinical course) during follow-up to prevent the spread of COVID-19 in the burn center.",

Urgent interventions should be performed under Group 2 preventive precautions.
