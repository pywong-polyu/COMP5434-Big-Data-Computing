An overview is provided on the measures that are available, and how to select screening tools and assessments. Emphasis is placed on different types of screening, patient-reported measures, assessment of anatomy and physiology of the swallowing act, and clinical swallowing evaluation. Many screening and noninstrumental assessments are available for evaluating dysphagia in adults; however, their use may not be warranted due to poor diagnostic performance or lacking robust psychometric properties. This white paper provides recommendations on how to select best evidence-based screening tools and non-instrumental assessments for use in clinical practice targeting different constructs, target populations and respondents, based on criteria for diagnostic performance, psychometric properties (reliability, validity, and responsiveness), and feasibility. In addition, gaps in research that need to be addressed in future studies are discussed. The following recommendations are made: (1) discontinue the use of non-validated dysphagia screening tools and assessments; (2) implement screening using tools that have optimal diagnostic performance in selected populations that are at risk of dysphagia, such as stroke patients, frail older persons, patients with progressive neurological diseases, persons with cerebral palsy, and patients with head and neck cancer; (3) implement measures that demonstrate robust psychometric properties; and (4) provide quality training in dysphagia screening and assessment to all clinicians involved in the care and management of persons with dysphagia.",

Despite there being no universally accepted definition, a commonly used description of dysphagia is the dysfunction of one or more parts of the swallowing apparatus including the mouth, the tongue, the oral cavity, the pharynx, the airway, and the oesophagus and its upper and lower sphincters, often due to anatomical or structural deficiencies or abnormalities [1] . Swallowing is not only essential for nutritional intake, but it is also directly involved in the management of internal secretions from the upper and lower aerodigestive tracts (e.g. saliva, bile, and nasal, tracheal or bronchial secretions). Dysphagia is associated with a broad spectrum of underlying congenital or acquired conditions which is influenced by both age and comorbid diseases [2] . Dysphagia is one of the leading causes of death and morbidity for older persons, children and adults with neurological disorders (e.g. cerebral palsy, stroke, dementia), or head and neck cancer patients, due to serious complications such as malnutrition, dehydration, and aspiration pneumonia [3, 4] .",

Dysphagia may modify the preparation, propulsion, and/or transit of the bolus through the upper digestive pathways and reflects abnormalities in transit and/or airway protection.

A systematic review on the prevalence of dysphagia in the general population indicated marked variability in prevalence rates, which ranged between 2.3 and 16% [6] . Another review demonstrated that the prevalence of dysphagia after stroke and in patients with Parkinson's disease, traumatic brain injury, and community-acquired pneumonia was high (8.1-80%, 11-81%, 27-30%, and 91.7%, respectively) [7] . The high variability in the retrieved prevalence data can be explained by discrepancies regarding dysphagia definitions, underlying diseases being at different stages with variable sequelae and using different measures to determine the presence of dysphagia. The impacts of definitional issues on determining accurate prevalence rates are twofold. First, definitional inconsistencies will have an impact on aspects of validity, reliability, and generalizability of prevalence numbers. Second, screening or assessments of dysphagia operationalizes the underlying construct being measured, and definitional inconsistencies will invariably influence what and how dysphagia is being measured. Despite the implications of definitional challenges, given the high prevalence of dysphagia [6, 7] , the serious complications associated with it, and costs to healthcare [8] , systematic screening of at-risk populations such as acute stroke patients should be central to healthcare strategies to improve early intervention and clinical outcomes in these clinical populations. Moreover, the high prevalence of dysphagia underscores the need for standardized, reliable, and valid methods for the screening and assessment of dysphagia.",

Patients who are identified as being at risk through screening are typically referred for further assessment and, where needed, related assessment including oral health and gastroesophageal reflux. Both screening and assessment need to be evidence-based and feasible to administer. Only screening with sufficient diagnostic performance and assessments with robust psychometric properties should be used clinically and in research. For example, using screening tools with poor diagnostic performance may result in missing people at risk for dysphagia (false positives) or lead to unnecessary use of limited resources by assessing those who are not at risk of dysphagia (false negatives). Similarly, implementing assessments with poor psychometric qualities will undermine evidencebased practice and research as current health status or intervention effects cannot be objectified if measures lack robustness in validity, reliability, or responsiveness [9, 10] .

Whereas the TOR-BSST screens for being at risk for dysphagia only, the V-VST provides additional oral intake advice. Still, as only single trials are used per volume-viscosity combination, any advice on oral intake should be made with caution, as using a limited number of swallow trials can underestimate the aspiration risk in persons with dysphagia, especially when using boluses with a thin liquid consistency [16] . Even when a screening tool uses several trials of the same volume and viscosity, for example the Gugging Swallowing Screen or GUSS [17] , any advice on oral intake should nevertheless be supported by findings from further assessment.",

Patients failing screening should be referred for further assessment by a dysphagia expert. However, patients having an established risk for dysphagia or manifest signs of dysphagia through case history may be referred for further assessment without being subjected to screening. If patients cannot be screened due to their cognitive state or health condition, screening should be postponed, usually resulting in recommended nil per os while waiting for screening. Some patient groups, however, may follow different screening and assessment pathways as no improvement in their condition is to be expected, for example, patients who may be at risk of dysphagia and have progressive cognitive decline (e.g. dementia). The lack of consensus and guidelines on how to manage these vulnerable populations result in moral dilemmas that need to be resolved on a case-by-case basis between healthcare practitioners and patients' family. In comparison, screening is usually recommended to be performed within the first 24 h following the stroke [21] ; however, there is no international consensus on what should be the critical timeframe for screening in other diagnostic groups.",

Screening tools can be developed and validated for specific target populations (e.g. patients after stroke, patients with head and neck cancer or frail older persons). The use of certain screening tools may not be recommended in other patient groups than the populations for which the screen was originally developed and validated for; validity of a screening must be confirmed again when its use is extended to other clinical populations. Sufficient intrarater, inter-rater, or test-retest reliability is often expressed by an intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) or weighted Kappa equal to or greater than 0.70 [24] . Diagnostic performance of a screening tool is determined by comparison with a reference test, usually fiberoptic endoscopic evaluation of swallowing (FEES) or videofluoroscopic evaluation of swallowing (VFS). According to the international COnsensus-based Standards for the selection of health Measurement INstruments (COSMIN), this is also referred to as criterion validity [25] . The reference test is considered the 'gold standard' and hypothesized to have no false negative or false positive results. In other words, the 'gold standard' correctly indicates the presence of dysphagia when the person truly has dysphagia (true positives) and identifies subjects as not having dysphagia when they truly do not have dysphagia (true negatives). As such, it is not recommended to use another screening or clinical assessment as reference test unless considered a 'gold standard'. Furthermore, both reference tests and screening tools may use different endpoints. For example, when administering a FEES, the occurrence of aspiration may be used as endpoint to confirm the diagnosis of dysphagia, whereas a water swallow screening may use coughing or a wet voice as endpoint for identifying a patient at risk of dysphagia. As different endpoints yield different diagnostic performance, clinicians and researchers must predefine and select endpoints before determining diagnostic performance.",

For example, if assessment after screening is expensive or invasive, clinicians may prefer to minimize the number of false positives and use a cut-point with high specificity. Conversely, if the penalty for missing a case is high (e.g. the disease is fatal but can be treated successfully), a clinician may prefer to maximizing the number of true positives by using a cut-point with high sensitivity. In general, tests with high sensitivity have low specificity; they are good for identifying actual cases of the disease but often at the expense of high rates of false positives. For example, results from a meta-analysis showed that increasing volumes in water swallow tests resulted in higher sensitivity but lower specificity when screening for aspiration in stroke patients [27] . There are, however, no strict guidelines on the optimal cutoffs for diagnostic performance. Some diagnostic reviews only included screening tools with a high sensitivity (at least 70%) and at least a moderate specificity (at least 60%; e.g. Proportion of TP to all positive predictions TP / (TP + FP) = PPV [11, 12] ). Even so, guidelines on what cut-off scores to use remain ambiguous. A receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve, a probability curve, visualizes the trade-off between sensitivity and specificity by presenting the true positive rate (sensitivity) as function of the false positive rate (100 minus specificity). Conversely, the area under the curve (AUC) can be interpreted as the average value of sensitivity for all possible values of specificity or the average value of specificity for all possible values of sensitivity [28] . AUC represents a measure of separability; how well is the model capable of distinguishing between two classes or groups, for example, between persons with or without dysphagia? The COSMIN guidelines stipulate that an AUC of at least 0.70 (or 70%) is required to provide evidence for sufficient criterion validity [24] .",

Consequently, disease-related functioning cannot be distinguished from disease-related quality of life as subjectively experienced by patients. Further, psychometric reviews on patient selfevaluation (e.g. [36, 37] ) and psychometric evaluations on most commonly used self-report measures in dysphagia (e.g. [38] [39] [40] [41] [42] ) identified that all existing measures have either poor psychometric properties or lack comprehensive evaluation and reporting of psychometric properties. This flags an urgent need for research. For example, even though the Eating Assessment Tool (EAT-10) is one of the most commonly used FHS measure in dysphagia, recent evidence using contemporary Item Response Theory 1 (IRT; Rasch analyses [43, 44] ) did not support its use in either research or clinical practice [38, [40] [41] [42] . Another frequently used FHS questionnaire is the Sydney Swallow Questionnaire (SSQ [45] ), which is yet to be evaluated using IRT.",

Therefore, the anatomy and physiology that underpins the swallowing act need to be understood to allow for the assessment thereof. Swallowing is a highly integrated neuro-sensorimotor function, realized by organs (effectors) affiliated with different systems and inter-linked with other functions, so that swallowing, breathing, and phonoarticulation alternate according to hierarchically correlated pathways [68] . Swallowing is the result of external (sight and smell) and internal sensory stimuli (touch, temperature, and taste), which converge at the meduallary swallowing centre, from where the motor efferents of the bulbar cranial nerves (CNs) start: CN V (Trigeminal nerve: motor), CN VII (Facial nerve), CN IX (Glossopharyngeal nerve), CN X (Vagus nerve), CN XII (Hypoglossal nerve), and cervical spinal nerves C1-C3. The CN XI (accessory nerve) carries motor fibres for the sternocleidomastoid muscle and trapezius muscles (spinal root), and parasympathetic preganglionic visceral fibres (cranial root) that join the CN X reaching the soft palate, pharynx, larynx, and oesophagus. The brainstem swallowing centre is widely connected and receives cortical, subcortical, thalamic, limbic and cerebellar descending modulatory afferents, which transform the semi-reflex nature of swallowing into spatiotemporal integrated muscular contractions (muscular patterns) [5] . The neurological structures (including cortex, extrapyramidal and pyramidal system, and cranial nerves) are contained in the neurocranium (protective shell surrounding the brain and brain stem), while the swallowing effectors are contained in the viscerocranium (skeleton supporting facial structure). At this level, the upper parts of the respiratory and digestive tract are arranged in parallel and conjugate in the pharyngeal cavity, which becomes a common pathway for both air and bolus transport. In this way, the pharynx acts alternately as an organ of the respiratory tract (chamber for air passage) as well as an organ of the digestive tract (peristaltic contracting chamber for bolus passage).",

In the oral cavity, the bolus is prepared (minced and mixed with saliva) as a consequence of coordinated actions between facial muscles, cheeks, teeth, jaws, tongue, and oral floor muscles [70] . When the bolus is transported into the pharyngeal cavity, a reflex reconfiguration of the pharynx occurs; the oropharynx transforms from a respiratory pathway to a swallow pathway [71] . The pharynx acts as a digestive lumen, generating contractile and peristaltic activities with the aim of transporting the bolus to the oesophagus [72] . A strict hierarchy between vital primordial reflex activities determines the arrest of respiration (apnea), thus allowing the pharyngeal transportation of the bolus [73] . The reconfiguration of the pharynx is defined by glossopalatal opening, velopharyngeal closure, upper and anterior hyoid laryngeal excursion, and upper oesophageal sphincter opening.",

CSE findings are important in determining whether an instrumental assessment may be required (if not already performed) and to decide which compensatory strategies and postural manoeuvres need to be prioritized for trialling to inform dysphagia therapy planning and patient management. At least a tentative diagnosis must be made and a management plan agreed upon following a CSE [31] . However, aspiration and other physiological problems in the pharyngeal phase of swallowing can only be diagnosed through directly observation using instrumental assessments [75] [76] [77] . The initial step in a CSE is to compile a thorough case history with the patient and/or carer. This involves a careful review of the medical history, if available, a history of the present condition (e.g. onset, duration of difficulties, symptoms), current swallowing status (e.g. method of oral intake and current diet, strategies that help swallowing, easiest and most difficult food consistencies to swallow), and factors that might influence management (e.g. comorbidities, cognition, food restrictions and nutritional status, presence of gastroesophageal reflux, and cultural preferences) [30] . Common examples of the many available measures used while compiling a case history are the Functional Oral Intake Scale (FOIS; [78] ) and the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE; [79] ) or Mini-Cog [80] to screen for cognitive impairment.",

If, however, the patient is drowsy, medically unstable, and unable to swallow saliva requiring suctioning, then trial feeding is deemed too high risk and should not be attempted. Selffeeding is preferred over feeding by carers or health care providers, to mimic typical eating and drinking patterns. As mentioned earlier, there are opposing views regarding which consistency to trial first. Some clinicians prefer to begin trials with small 5 ml volumes of water, gradually increasing the volume before moving to thicker consistencies. The rationale is that water, if aspirated, combined with good oral hygiene will be absorbed into the lungs without the immediate risk for the development of pneumonia [84, 85] . Other clinicians prefer to start with thickened consistencies so as to reduce the risk for aspiration [15] . Trials with fluids that promote sensation, for example carbonation and sweet and sour bolus, may be included in CSE [86] [87] [88] . The temperature of the bolus may also be manipulated with colder boluses used to increase sensation [89] . Thicker consistencies may be trialled later as they may give rise to residue in the pharynx which, in turn, can lead to aspiration [18] . When assessing chewing it is important to evaluate the patient's ability to manage solids and to identify risk of choking also. Assessments such as the Test of Mastication and Swallowing of Solids (TOMASS [90] ) may be useful.",

Feasibility refers to the practicability of using an assessment in its intended setting, taking into account constraints of time, money, and interpretability [10] . Other important factors related to feasibility include, for example, patient's cognitive functioning and physical ability, patient's and clinician's ability to comprehend items, ease of administration, duration of administering the assessment, simplicity of score calculation, accessibility of required equipment in different settings, copyright requirements, and associated costs to acquire and administer the assessments [10] . Another consideration include administering, where appropriate, assessments via telehealth instead of face-to-face to increase accessibility to healthcare in rural and remote areas [105] , to increase service reach, reduce costs [106] , and more recently to continue providing safe health services during the COVID-19 pandemic.",
