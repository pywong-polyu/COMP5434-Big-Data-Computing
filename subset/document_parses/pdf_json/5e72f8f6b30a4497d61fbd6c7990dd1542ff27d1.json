            "text": "Background Since COVID-19 was declared the pandemic by the WHO, it has continued to spread. There is a need for rapid, efficient, and accurate diagnostic kits and techniques to control its spread. Objective The diagnostic capability of the qRT-PCR-based Real-Q 2019-nCoV Detection Kit and dPCR-based Dr. PCR\u2122 Di20K COVID-19 Detection Kit was compared and evaluated. Methods Diagnostic tests for COVID-19 were performed using two different COVID-19 kits and 301 individual specimens with confirmed COVID-19 positive/negative at the government-accredited medical institution. Assessment of diagnostic capability was measured through diagnostic sensitivity, specificity, Cohen's Kappa coefficient, and dilutional linearity tests. Results The COVID-19 diagnostic test results using two kits and 301 individual specimens perfectly matched the pre-diagnosis results of the medical institution. In addition, the measurement results of diagnostic sensitivity and specificity were \"1\", indicating high diagnostic capability. Cohen's Kappa coefficient value is \"1\", which means that the diagnosis concordance between the two kits is \"Almost Perfect\". As a result of dilutional linearity tests to evaluate their detection capability, both kits were measured with very high detection reliability. Conclusion Here, we propose that the dPCR-based Dr. PCR\u2122 Di20K COVID-19 Detection Kit has the advantages of the dPCR method reported in the previous study and is suitable for point-of-care testing (POCT) by overcoming the limitations of space, test time, cross-over contamination, and biosafety due to omitting RNA extraction process.",

The causative virus of COVID-19 is Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a new type of coronavirus. This virus belongs to the subgenus Sarbecovirus of the genus Betacoronavirus and has been reported to cause fatal respiratory disease in humans (Utku et al. 2020; Wang et al. 2020) . The main route of transmission COVID-19 is from an infected person to uninfected people through respiratory aerosols and droplets conveying the SARS-CoV-2 (Harrison et al. 2020; Lotfi et al. 2020; Syal 2021) . To date, vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 have been developed by various global pharmaceutical companies such as Pfizer Inc., AstraZeneca PLC, Moderna Inc., and Janssen Inc. to prevent the spread of COVID-19 (Kaur and Gupta 2020) . Nevertheless, new SARS-CoV-2 mutations (Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, Omicron, etc.) with 1.5-2 times higher infectivity have appeared, and the disease continues to spread due to the absence of an effective therapeutic agent (Khan et al. 2022 ). In addition, poor diagnosis and asymptomatic transmission have accelerated the rapid spread of COVID-19. Therefore, it is crucial to control the further spread of COVID-19 through prompt and accurate diagnosis in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients along with the development of therapeutic agents and vaccines.",

            "text": "Globally, quantitative Real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), Digital PCR (dPCR), Whole-genome sequencing, Nanopore target sequencing (NTS), Antibody detection, Antigen detection, and CRISPR-Cas system-based method (e.g., SHERLOCK) are being applied as detection methods for SARS-CoV-2 (Eftekhari et al. 2021; Giri et al. 2021; Liu et al. 2020 ). Among various detection methods, the qRT-PCR is a method based on viral RNA amplification (Falzone et al. 2021) . It detects using primers and probes sets composed of specific viral sequences of SARS-CoV-2 such as E gene, RdRp gene, and N gene. Most antibody detection methods determine whether the virus is detected by measuring the levels of IgM and IgG in the immune system. Typically, lateral flow type assays (LFA) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent type assays (ELISA) are mainly used (Mahmoudinobar et al. 2021 ). However, antibody detection methods can lead to falsepositive results due to cross-reactivity in which an antibody binds to an antigen with high molecular similarity other than the target antigen (Liu and Rusling 2021) . A person infected with SARS-CoV-2 usually develops antibodies after about 14 days (Cevik et al. 2020; Wolfel et al. 2020) . According to the results of a recent study, it has been reported that IgG and IgM can be detected 5 days after infection (Loeffelholz and Tang 2020) . Thus, antibody detection methods have a disadvantage that can lead to false-negative results if sufficient antibodies for diagnosing COVID-19 are not formed (Chang et al. 2020) . Antigen detection methods are intuitive and straightforward diagnostic methods for COVID-19 (Yuce et al. 2021) . Like antibody detection methods, these methods can be performed by LFA or ELISA. However, these methods have low sensitivity compared to nucleic acid testing and do not satisfy the clinical sensitivity criteria (96%) of the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety of the Republic of Korea (MFDS) guideline (Department 2020). In particular, the qRT-PCR method based on viral RNA amplification is considered a gold standard because it has almost 100% specificity and high accuracy (> 97%), unlike other molecular tests that do not have perfect diagnostic specificity (Garg et al. 2021; Teymouri et al. 2021) . Although most laboratories diagnose COVID-19 with the qRT-PCR method, there are some weaknesses. It is still difficult to accurately diagnose low viral load in the early stages of SARS-CoV-2 infection (Gupta et al. 2021) . In general, this method requires the RNA extraction step and thus has several problems such as cross-contamination, additional experiment cost, and time (Ref 24, 25) . In addition, the cost of the qRT-PCR equipment is relatively high, and diagnostic space is limited due to its size.",

DCM402-X, Optolane, Seongnam, Republic of Korea) system has been reported that it is less affected by PCR inhibitors than the typical qRT-PCR assay and can be detected even at low viral loads (Lee et al. 2021a; Sidstedt et al. 2020 ). In addition, this system has high diagnostic sensitivity and specificity. However, this system requires the RNA extraction step and various resources such as consumables costs and experimental time, as well as carry-over contamination and biosafety risks when handling clinical samples (Wee et al. 2020) . Approved by MFDS in March 2021, Dr. PCR\u2122 Di20K COVID-19 Detection Kit (Optolane, Seongnam, Republic of Korea) was newly released. It can be applied to the LOAA dPCR system. This system is designed to overcome the weak points of the existing qRT-PCR and dPCR methods. In addition, since it is possible to diagnose COVID-19 without a viral RNA extraction step, rapid test results and efficient point-of-care testing (POCT) can be predicted. Through this system, it is expected to quickly and accurately screen patients suspected of having COVID-19 to inhibit the spread of the virus.",

            "text": "Through the COVID-19 diagnostic test of the qRT-PCRbased Real-Q 2019-nCoV Detection Kit and dPCR-based Dr. PCR\u2122 Di20K COVID-19 Detection Kit, we confirmed that the diagnostic results using the two different kits were completely consistent. We calculated using Cohen's Kappa coefficient to measure the agreement and reliability between the two diagnostic results. The Kappa coefficient is a probability value, and the closer to 1, the higher the agreement between two different data (Czodrowski 2014) . When the COVID-19 diagnostic test results using the two kits were calculated by Cohen's Kappa coefficient, the value was \"1\" meaning \"Almost Perfect\". In order to evaluate the detection capability between the two different kits depending on the virus concentration, a high concentration of SARS-CoV-2 positive specimens (OP003, OP009, OP010, OP013, OP015, OP017, OP137, If the E gene is negative but the RdRP gene is positive, it is determined as \"Undetermined\", and if the same result is obtained after retesting, it is determined as positive c If the E gene is positive but the RdRP gene is negative, it is determined as \"SARS-CoV\" d If the 'Valid' condition is met in NTC, PC, or PCRC, use DEPC treated water to dilute 1/5 and then proceed with re-reaction e If the number of valid wells is less than 10,000, it is determined as invalid, and the cartridge is discarded and retested with a new cartridge OP190, OP253, OP260) was selected. The high concentration SARS-CoV-2 positive specimens were spike-in treated with the negative patient specimen, diluted, and then the dilutional linearity test was carried out based on C/uL. The correlation of the detection capabilities of two different kits was confirmed through the spike-in treatment of the negative patient specimen at the high concentration SARS-CoV-2 positive specimens. The dilutional linearity test was carried out after dilution of the treated individual specimen depending on the dilution factors from 10 \u22121 to 10 \u22127 (Table 3) . As shown in Table 4 , we confirmed that SARS-CoV-2 could be detected up to the dilution factor of 10 -5 in both results of the qRT-PCR-based Real-Q 2019-nCoV Detection Kit and the dPCR-based Dr. PCR\u2122 Di20K COVID-19 Detection Kit. Thus, this means that the dPCRbased Dr. PCR\u2122 Di20K COVID-19 Detection Kit has the same detection capability as the qRT-PCR-based Real-Q 2019-nCoV Detection Kit approved by FDA-Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) and MFDS-EUA. In addition, the results of regression analysis measured depending on the dilution factors of 10 randomly selected individual specimens (OP003, OP009, OP010, OP013, OP015, OP017, OP137, OP190, OP253, OP260) were average R 2 = 0.99915 in the qRT-PCR assay with Real-Q 2019-nCoV Detection Kit and average R 2 = 0.98515 in the dPCR assay with Dr. PCR\u2122 Di20K COVID-19 Detection Kit ( Fig. 4; Fig. S1 ; Fig. S2 ). This means that both kits have high detection reliability (Gougeon 2005) . In summary, dPCR-based Dr. PCR\u2122 Di20K COVID-19 Detection Kit has the same high detection reliability as the qRT-PCR method. In addition, this kit has the advantages of the dPCR method as reported in the previous study, and at the same time, omits the RNA extraction step, suggesting that the SARS-CoV-2 can be detected relatively quickly.",

Thus, we compared the diagnostic capability of the recently released dPCR-based Dr. PCR\u2122 Di20K COVID-19 Detection Kit (approved by the Korea MFDS) without the viral RNA extraction step and the qRT-PCR-based Real-Q 2019-nCoV Detection Kit (approved by the US FDA EUA and the Korea MFDS EUA) commonly used in Korea. We obtained the 301 individual specimens with confirmed COVID-19 positive/negative from the government-accredited medical institution and performed the SARS-CoV-2 detection test using these two kits. The results of both kits confirmed that the COVID-19 diagnosis was perfectly matched, and the clinical sensitivity and specificity were 100%. In addition, the dilutional linearity test demonstrated that both of these kits were capable of detection at low viral loads (10 -5 ) with high confidence. However, the dPCR-based Dr. PCR\u2122 Di20K COVID-19 Detection Kit could cover the weaknesses of the qRT-PCR-based method.",
