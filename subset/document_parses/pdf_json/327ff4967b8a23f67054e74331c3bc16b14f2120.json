Inspired by the peculiar spatial arrangement of salp colonies, which are displaced in long chains following a leader, this algorithm seems to provide an interesting optimization performance. However, the original work was characterized by some conceptual and mathematical flaws, which influenced all ensuing papers on the subject. In this manuscript, we perform a critical review of SSO, highlighting all the issues present in the literature and their negative effects on the optimization process carried out by this algorithm. We also propose a mathematically correct version of SSO, named Amended Salp Swarm Optimizer (ASSO) that fixes all the discussed problems. We benchmarked the performance of ASSO on a set of tailored experiments, showing that it is able to achieve better results than the original SSO. Finally, we performed an extensive study aimed at understanding whether SSO and its variants provide advantages compared to other metaheuristics. The experimental results, where SSO cannot outperform simple well-known metaheuristics, suggest that the scientific community can safely abandon SSO.",

Salps are barrel-shaped animals living in swarms that are organized in long chains, actively looking for phytoplankton. SSO leverages the metaphor of this peculiar spatial arrangement by translating it into an optimization algorithm. Specifically, the individuals composing a population are constrained to follow the leader salp, while the latter is performing the actual exploration for food sources. In this metaphor, the leader explores the search space for optimal regions-with respect to the fitness function-while the followers exploit the area surrounding the leader.",

In particular, we will show that the most remarkable issue is the fact that SSO, in its original formulation, is not shift-invariant. This raises a problem if the lower bound of the search space is too far from the origin. In this paper, we first propose an Amended Salp Swarm Optimizer (ASSO), which represents a correct reformulation of the SSO algorithm as was probably intended by its creators. Still, our objective is not to promote the use of ASSO in the scientific community. Indeed, while ASSO fixes the mathematical flaws of SSO, it is still not grounded on any theoretical basis. Thus, ASSO would be one of the several metaheuristics based on some natural metaphor and built by combining search operators that do not rely on any theoretical property [49] . For this reason, we subsequently assess the performance of ASSO and SSO against simple",

Incidentally, in the highlights of the original paper [43] , the authors state that the official name of the algorithm is Salp Swarm Optimizer, although the acronym SSA is used in the rest of the article. In this paper, we will use the name Salp Swarm Optimization and the acronym SSO to prevent confusion.

Section 4 presents an experimental evaluation of the improved version of SSO that fixes some of the raised issues, and compares the result with the original version on a set of standard benchmark functions. Subsequently, we analyze the performance of SSO and its variants on the CEC 2017 benchmark function suite against two commonly used metaheuristics, namely Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMAES) [30] and Differential Evolution (DE) [60] . Finally, Section 5 summarises the main issues of the original SSO algorithm, and concludes with a broader remark on the nature of the salp metaphor.",

After the publication of a given metaheuristic, it is also common to see a significant number of scientific papers that use the new metaheuristic to address complex real-world problems claiming its superior performance compared to existing metaheuristics. Luckily, a research strand started to criticize the definition of these metaheuristics, observing that, in most of the cases, their performance cannot be better than the commonly used evolutionary strategies [69] .

As a consequence, the performance of HS is always bounded by the performance that can be obtained by evolution strategies. Finally, Weyland demonstrated that the results achieved in [27] are flawed both from the theoretical and the practical point of view, concluding that there is no reason for the existence of HS as a novel metaheuristic. Despite the Weyland's work clearly demonstrated the lack of novelty of HS, the algorithm is still largely used nowadays.

The truth is that HS, and other related metaheuristics, are simply using a different terminology with respect to the classic evolutionary strategies. While the lack of novelty did not prevent metaheuristics based on natural metaphors to be published in well-renowned scientific venues, some scientific journals are seriously tackling the problem. For instance, Marco Dorigo, the editor in chief of Swarm Intelligence, published an editorial note [16] stating that he observed a new trend consisting in \"taking a natural system/process and use it as a metaphor to generate an algorithm whose components have names taken from the natural system/process used as metaphor\". Dorigo also highlighted that \"this approach has become so common that there are now hundreds of so-called new algorithms that are submitted (and unfortunately often also published) to journals and conferences every year\", and concluded his editorial stating that \"it is difficult to understand what is new and what is the same as the old with just a new name, and whether the proposed algorithm is just a small incremental improvement of a known algorithm or a radically new idea\".",

There, the authors first highlighted the vast number of swarm intelligence algorithms developed by taking inspiration from the behavior of insects and other animals and phenomena. Subsequently, they showed that most algorithms present common macro-processes among them, despite the fact that they are inspired by different metaphors. In other words, the considered metaheuristics are characterized by common issues and features which happen at the individual level, promoting very similar emergent phenomena [14] . Thus, it is difficult (if not impossible) to claim that such metaheuristics are really novel.",

This problem was pointed out by Mart\u00ednez et al. [26] . Specifically, the authors investigated whether the increasing number of publications is correlated with real progress in the field of heuristic-based optimization. To answer this research question, the authors compared five heuristics proposed in some of the most reputed journals in the area, and compared their performance to the winner of the IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation 2005. The results showed that the considered methods could not achieve the result of the competition winner, which was published several years before.

Then, the RS, SSO, SSO-code, and ASSO were compared against basic versions of CMAES [30] and DE [60] . We used the standard version of CMAES and DE implemented in the Pymoo library (Multi-objective Optimization in Python) [10] , which allows for easily using both single-and multi-objective algorithms, exploiting the default parameters proposed by the authors of the library. Specifically, concerning CMAES, the initial standard deviation was set to 0.5 for each coordinate, and no restart strategy was applied. Regarding DE, according to the classic DE taxonomy, the DE/rand/1/bin variant was used with a differential weight F = 0.3 and a crossover rate equal to 0.5.",

For each iteration, we kept track of the fitness value of the best individual, over the 30 repetitions, to calculate the Average Best Fitness (ABF). For a completely fair comparison among the different techniques, we fixed a budget of 100 iterations using 50 individuals. Note that the implemented RS randomly generates 50 particles, at each iteration, without taking into account any information of the previous iterations. Figure 1a clearly shows that both SSO and SSO-code are not shift-invariant. Indeed, shifting 2-D standard benchmark functions by a large constant hampered the optimization abilities of both SSO and SSO-code. Across all the tested functions, even RS obtained better results compared to SSO and SSO-code. On the contrary, our proposed algorithm ASSO -where we simply removed the term c 1 lb j -was able to outperform the other techniques. It is worth reminding that ASSO is not a novel algorithm, but an amended version of SSO in which the mathematical errors have been corrected.",

Only considering the Rosenbrock function a strong statistical difference is present between SSO and SSO-code.

In order to show this behavior, we will use a fitness function that returns a random number with uniform distribution in [0, 1). For a swarm intelligence algorithm, we would expect a uniform distribution of particles across the entire search space using such a fitness function. Stated otherwise, using a random fitness function, the salps should not converge anywhere, and should randomly wander across the search space. However, we will show that, following the non-amended equations provided in the original SSO paper [43] , the swarm converges in the origin providing an unfair advantage in the case of optimization problems whose global optimum lies in x = 0 (and possibly lead to sub-optimal performance in the case of real-world functions). Figure 2 shows the result of this test, performed on both SSO and SSO-code with and without the food attractor. The Figure reports the positions of all salps during the first 10 iterations of the optimization; the position of the leader salp is highlighted by an orange circle, and the initial position is denoted by the text \"Start\". According to our results, the leader salp get attracted toward zero. The same happens for SSO-code: the leader salp it is inevitably attracted towards the center of the search space. The attraction towards the origin is even more evident in the case of SSO and SSO-code without food attraction: the swarm perfectly converges to the origin and no longer moves. ",

            "text": "During the last years, different benchmark function suites have been proposed to test and compare existing and novel global optimization techniques [63] . The benchmark functions they contain try to mimic the behavior of real-world problems, which often show complex features that basic optimization algorithms might not be able to grasp [25, 63] . Regarding the real-parameter numerical optimization, the IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation (CEC) and the Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Conference (GECCO) include competitions where complex benchmark function suites have been designed to test and compare global optimization techniques [13, 28, 29, 15] . Here, we evaluated the performance of the considered optimization techniques using the CEC 17 benchmark problems for single-objective real-parameter numerical optimization [9] , which were previously used to compare the performance of different metaheuristics [62, 47, 63] . Table 1 reports the tested benchmark problems, which are based on shifted, rotated, non-separable, highly ill-conditioned, and complex optimization benchmark functions [9] . We optimized each function f k (with k = 1, . . . , 30) considering the dimensions D = {10, 30}, search space boundaries For each technique, we executed 30 independent runs to collect statistically sound results. Figure 3 depicts the Average Best Fitness (ABF) obtained by the analyzed techniques for each function f k (with k = 1, . . . , 30) and D = 10, showing that DE was able to obtain better results than all the SSO-based strategies, including ASSO, and the simple RS tested here. As one can see, DE outperformed the SSO-based strategies in 27 out of 30 functions. CMAES also obtained better results than the SSO-based strategies in more than half of the tested functions. As we did for the standard benchmark functions, we evaluated if the achieved results were also different from a statistical point of view by using the Mann-Whitney U test with the Bonferroni correction [42, 70, 19] . Thus, we independently compared the results obtained by the six techniques on each benchmark function f k (with k = 1, . . . , 30) considering the distributions built using the value of the best individual at the end of the last iteration over the 30 repetitions. The heatmaps showed in Figure 4 clearly point out that there is almost always a strong statistical difference between the results achieved by all the SSO-based strategies, including ASSO, and those obtained by DE. Specifically, SSO-based strategies were able to obtain comparable or better results than those reached by DE only for the functions f 21 , f 25 , and f 28 . Comparing the results achieved by CMAES and those obtained by SSO-based strategies, there is a strong statistical difference in more than half of the tested functions. These results are coherent with the probabilistic re-formulation of the no-free lunch theorem (NFL) [40] , an extension of the original version of the NFL theorem [71, 41] , which prove the validity of the theorem in continuous domains. Thus, according to the NFL theorem, no algorithm outperforms all the competitors in any optimization problem.",

As shown in our experiments, under some specific circumstances, this factor can significantly affect the search capabilities of SSO, which was outperformed by a simple random search. If the term lb j was inadvertently introduced, all the current literature on SSO contains results not reflecting the intended definition of the algorithm. On the other hand, if the authors meant to insert the term, the SSO algorithm cannot work in spaces that have lower bounds too far from 0 in all dimensions. We also compared the described SSO-based approaches against DE and CMAES for the optimization of the CEC 2017 benchmark functions [9] , showing that all the SSO-based versions were outperformed by a simple DE version on almost all functions. These results highlight, once more, that SSO and similar algorithms do not give any particular advantages with respect to widespread and common metaheuristics. Considering all the results discussed in this work, we expect that more sophisticated metaheuristics, such as Linear population size reduction Successful History-based Adaptive DE (L-SHADE) [61, 51, 50, 48] that already showed their superior performance compared The confidence interval was divided into 4 levels indicating a strong statistical difference, statistical difference, weak statistical difference, and no statistical difference, respectively.",

            "text": "In particular, there is no theory supporting the convergence properties of SSO and its (supposed) superiority with respect to the existing metaheuristics. On the contrary, SSO is defined and implemented based on a wrong mathematical formulation, as discussed in the first part of this paper. We conclude this paper with a general remark about the metaphor-based approach for metaheuristics. As mentioned in the Introduction, a lot of metaheuristic optimization algorithms have been proposed in the last years, most of them based on a particular natural process or animal behavior as a metaphor for the exploration and exploitation phases of the search space. As noted by [59] , one of the likely causes of this phenomenon is the excessive focus on the novelty of such methods in part of the research community on metaheuristics. This research approach, however, has the downside of shadowing the true search components of an optimization algorithm with terms and concepts borrowed from the considered metaphor. Therefore, it can happen that a \"novel\" metaheuristic optimization technique turns out to be just another well-known algorithm under a heavy disguise. This is the case, for example, of three other recent Swarm Intelligence algorithms, namely: the Grey Wolf Optimizer, the Firefly Optimization Algorithm, and the Bat Algorithm, which were shown by [17] to have strong similarities with Particle Swarm Optimization. While in this manuscript we showed and fixed the methodological and implementation flaws of SSO, we believe that a closer inspection of the algorithm's underlying metaphor would also highlight a strong resemblance to other established swarm algorithms.",
