Marine resources are not explored much and to be taken into consideration for exploring antiviral potential. Chitosan (carbohydrate polymer) is one such bioactive glycan found ubiquitously in marine organisms. The presence of reactive amine/hydroxyl groups, with low toxicity/allergenicity, compels us to explore it against SARS-CoV-2. We have screened a library of chitosan derivatives by site-specific docking at not only spike protein Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) of wild type SARS-CoV-2 but also on RBD of B.1.1.7 (UK) and P.1 (Brazil) SARS-CoV-2 variants. The obtained result was very interesting and ranks N-benzyl-O-acetyl-chitosan, Imino-chitosan, Sulfated-chitosan oligosaccharides derivatives as a potent antiviral candidate due to its high binding affinity of the ligands (-6.0 to -6.6 kcal/mol) with SARS-CoV-2 spike protein RBD and they critically interacting with amino acid residues Tyr 449, Asn 501, Tyr 501, Gln 493, Gln 498 and some other sitespecific residues associated with higher transmissibility and severe infection. Further ADMET analysis was done and found significant for exploration of the future therapeutic potential of these three ligands. The obtained results are highly encouraging in support for consideration and exploration in further clinical studies of these chitosan derivatives as anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapeutics.",

Later it was determined to be caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus, a beta-coronavirus closely related to the other CoVs such as SARS and Bat coronavirus RaTG13 [1] in lineage B subtype of beta coronaviruses belonging to the Coronavirinae subfamily, covered under the broad umbrella of the Coronaviridae family [2] . The infection, mortality, and morbidity rate of the virus were significantly high. With COVID-19 infection inflicting harm around the world, finding effective therapeutic interventions became a top priority and is sustained to be with the emergence of mutant variants of the virus. Global efforts to develop highly efficient and safe vaccines to combat COVID-19 infection causing virus have met with varying degrees of success in terms of vaccine design but the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants [B.1.1.7 (UK) and P.1 (Brazil)] is markedly more resistant to neutralization by vaccine [3] .",

Therefore it is an urgent need to discover some therapeutics to combat effectively with wild-type strain as well as variants of SARS-CoV-2. A significant number of antiviral drugs have been in clinical trials for the treatment of hospitalized and critically ill patients in the last year. However, the majority of them have been ineffective against SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis. New data suggest the various infection-causing pathways and the receptors and enzymes involved as drug targets sites that can be exploited for stopping the infection cycle of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. One of the notable targets has been the Spike protein, a glycoprotein on the virus surface which is pivotal for its binding to a wide variety of host cell receptors (Fig. 1) . Also, greater concern has been associated with this glycoprotein due to its fast pace mutation, and its effects on the efficacy of existing therapeutics. Notably, advances in vaccine development have been a global initiative [4] . Moreover, the spontaneous mutation from wild-type variants caused by secondary transmission has brought out greater concerns of intolerance to therapeutic interventions. This calls for rational designing of efficacious treatment strategies to robustly tackle this pandemic by targeting various pathways and mechanisms of infection by either creating new drug molecules or repurpose already existing drug molecules for impacting virus infection cycle or structural proteins [2] .",

[5] . Chitosan is chitin (second to cellulose in terms of wide availability as a polysaccharide) derivative and is structural, a randomly deacetylated copolymer of \u03b2-(1-4)-linked d-glucosamine and N-acetyl-dglucosamine [6] . In the past few decades, Chitosan has been well explored as a potent antimicrobial, alone or in combination with other compounds [7] . It is also well acknowledged as an antiviral agent in an extensive review by Chirkov [8] . A quaternized chitosan derivative, N-(2-hydroxypropyl)-3-trimethylammonium chitosan chloride (HTCC) has been notable in impeding the growth of a wide range of human coronaviruses, inhibition varying with different substitutions [9] .",

These proteins are spike glycoprotein, small envelope glycoprotein, membrane glycoprotein, and nucleocapsid protein, each playing a well-defined role [10] . Of all these, spike protein has been looked upon as a major target responsible for infection initiation. It is a homotrimeric peptide with each monomer having two distinct, S1 and S2 subunits. S1 subunit is dissociated upon binding of spike protein with Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors which stimulate the S2 subunit to come into a stable state required for membrane fusion for facilitating virus entry into the host cell [11] . Spike protein has been reported to acquire two different forms, an unstable pre-fusion (closed state) and a stable post-fusion (open state). The latter state entails exposed Receptor binding domain which has specificity towards ACE2 receptors, opposite to the former one [12] . While the interaction of spike protein with human ACE2 receptors has gained significant attention [13] , binding of RBD of S1 subunit of spike protein to heparan sulfate site, a site adjacent to ACE2 receptor site has recently been talked about. This latter type of binding has been shown to enhance the interactions between ACE2 and spike protein of the virus by favouring RBD open conformation [14] .",

As aforementioned, the pre-fusion state favors binding to the heparan sulfate site and the postfusion state is pivotal for binding to ACE2 receptors to assist virus access inside the host cell. Heparin disaccharide was taken as a positive control for the former interaction and ACE2 receptor as a positive control for the latter one. This exercise led to the identification of three chitosan derivatives, namely N-benzyl-O-acetyl-chitosan, Imino-chitosan, and Sulfated-chitosan oligosaccharides with relatively higher binding affinities and site-specificity. Nbenzoyl-O-acetyl-chitosan is prepared from chitosan after partial acylation. This is a novel derivative in the sense that it has not been studied for its antiviral activity to date. However, its reported antibacterial and antifungal activities reflect superior action compared to chitosan alone. The protonation of amino groups, high hydrophobicity, and presence of benzyl group (antimicrobial and antifungal) was proposed as plausible mechanisms behind enhanced penetration of this compound into the microbial cell membranes [15] . A variety of Imino-chitosan biopolymeric films synthesized by acid condensation of amino groups of chitosan with different aldehydes have shown strong antimicrobial properties, compared to chitosan control [16] . Conversely, sulfatedchitosan oligosaccharide has been reported to show activity against HIV-1 infection [17] . None of these molecules have been explored against SARS-CoV-2 virus targets and thus, making this study novel.",

The top-performing ligands have also been docked against the mutated variants of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, namely Brazilian and UK strains to validate their binding consistency. To understand the activity of the selected derivatives against other virus targets, they were docked against the virus main protease enzyme, taking Boceprevir as the positive control. ADMET analysis of the three selected derivatives was done to evaluate their pharmacokinetic potential for future clinical usage.

The three-dimensional molecular structure of these chitosan derivatives was retrieved from the PubChem database. Some derivatives were not considered for further docking which was reported as antiviral and/or antimicrobial. This is due to the scoring function limitations of AutodockVina of up to 20 flexible bonds (22) , along with the problem that they can't be broken down to smaller monomers, or dimers as they lose the structural properties. UCSF chimera tools were used in structure generation from the PubChem database, and energy minimization for each ligand, done individually with conjugate descent steps of 100 was taken with a step size of 0.02 Angstroms and along with default parameters such as steepest descent steps of 100 with a step size of 0.02 Angstroms, and update interval of 10. Finally, Dock prep of each model of each ligand was done by the addition of gasteiger charges (23) , and hydrogens were written in .mol2 format and later converted to Autodockvina executable format with the help of Autodock tools.",

An array of 14 amino acid residues of RBD of SARS-CoV-2 (wild type) binds to ACE2 at RMSF (\u22643.5 \u00c5) summarized in Tables 1, 2, and Fig. 2 , along with the disulfide bonds. These residues play a significant role in higher binding affinity and stable binding of the spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 to ACE2 receptor in comparison to other beta coronaviruses of the same lineage specifically SARS-CoV. Viruses sharing a similar phenotype that of SARS-CoV-2 cause severe respiratory infection in humans. To summarize, the key features that make ACE2 susceptible to RBD of SARS-CoV-2 are a) presence of 9 cysteines out which 8 of cysteine for four pairs of disulfide bonds out of which three (Cys336-Cys361 (2), Cys379-Cys432, and Cys391-Cys525) [11, 12, 30, 31] provide stability to beta-sheets and one (Cys480-Cys488) [31] that connects the loop in the distal end of Receptor Binding Motif (RBM). b) participation of virus binding hotpots residues Lys 31 and Lys 353 of N-terminal peptidase of ACE2 ( Fig. 3 ) that was previously reported to be pivotal for binding to SARS-CoV-2 RBM due to the charge neutralization by lysine [32, 33] . Moreover, this characteristic of these residues of ACE2 is well reserved in case of binding to SARS-CoV-2. Initially, a hydrogen bond is formed between Lys 31 (ACE2) and Gln 493 (RBD) but experiences low stability due to the bulky side chain's absences around Leu 455 residue leading to breaking off the bond between Gln 493 (RBD) and Lys 31 (ACE2) with the formation of a stronger hydrogen bond between Gln 493 (RBD) and Glu 35 (ACE2) [12, 34] , and Lys 31 (ACE2) forming an attractive ",

[36, 37] , although several other mutations have occurred in the overall spike glycoprotein. However, the marked change that is standard for all three types is the mutation of residue Asn 501 to Tyr 501 on RBD of SARS-CoV-2 [38] (Fig. 5) . Mutation of residue Glu 484 to Lys 484 has advanced the opportunity to escape neutralizing antibodies for the Spike protein [39] . A study reported by Supasa et.al suggested mutation of residue Asn 501 to Tyr 501 in B.1.1.7 variant has raised the binding affinity of ACE2 to RBD; it has also contributed to dodging the neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), potentially jeopardizing the efficacy of current vaccines [19] . On mapping interaction of P.1 Lineage variant of SARS-CoV-2 RBD with ACE2 at RMSF (\u22643.5 \u00c5), it was observed that there was a significantly lower fluctuation in loop 484-509 ( Fig. 6 ) compared to that of the previous wild type strain; this observation can be attributed to the mutation of Glu 484 to Lys 484, Lys 417 to Thr 417 and Asn 501 to Tyr 501. The striking feature of the salt bridge formed by Lys 417 is absent in the case of a mutated variant. Also, there are direct interactions observed between the hotspots residues Glu 35, Asp 38, Tyr 41, Gln 42, Lys 353 (ACE2) and residues Gln 493, Tyr 449, Gln 498, and Tyr 501 of RBD along with most of the other interaction previously seen with the wild type Table 3 . This contributed to lowering of fluctuation in the ACE2 burial region of RBD with an increase in the overall burial area of ACE2 (Tables 4-5) . It is to be noted that these residues' mutations did not contribute to any significant geometric change of RBD (Fig. 5) . These indicate the confidence in the residue selection for ACE2 binding sites as the active target site for identifying potential molecules inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 RBD binding to ACE2 for RBD exposed open conformation state.

            "text": "A library of Chitosan and Chitosan derivatives reported as antimicrobial and/or antiviral agents submitted in PubChem, Chem spider databases were screened for their binding affinity for the Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 in complex with ACE2 receptor (PDB ID: 6M0J). They were blindly docked for understanding the putative binding affinity to RBD. There were promising results for the same as listed in Table 6 . Out of the following derivatives, halogen derivatives and molecules with higher torsions (>20) and binding affinity lower than -6.0 kcal/mol were ruled out for further active target site docking. Halogen derivatives were ruled out because the bond formation by halogens with large protein system has not been understood at an atomic level, although a recent study by Milewskaet al., based on the antiviral efficacy of N-(2-hydroxypropyl)-3-trimethylammonium chitosan chloride (HTCC) against beta coronaviruses MERS-CoV of the same lineage to that to SARS-CoV-2 conducted in-vitro in Vero and Vero E6 cell lines and ex vivo studies conducted by deploying human airway epithelium (HAE) model reflected the potential of HTCC in hampering virus replication with a more pronounced effect on SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV although they have a different viral entry mechanism. It also significantly inhibited the internalization of viruses into vulnerable cells by reacting with spike protein through electrostatic interactions but still, the exact mechanism is not widely understood [9, 40] . On further docking at the putative active target sites loop at 484-509 residues, there was a significant reduction in binding affinity of screened residues, so again ligands with a binding affinity lower than -6.0 kcal/mol were ruled out. Among them, novel antimicrobial derivatives of chitosan N- benzoyl-O-acetyl-chitosan (Pubchem CID 129851122), Imino-chitosan (Pubchem CID: 129887062), and antiviral Sulfated-chitosan oligosaccharide [17] had the best putative binding affinity. Later these ligands were further analyzed for multiple target sites. In Table 7 , the breakup of all the hydrogen bonds types and other types of interaction formed by the selected moiety has been determined and analysis for each Ligand and conformation model is shown in both mesh surface and electrostatic surface (Fig. 7a-c) . Also, these ligands were docked with the new vari- Table 7 . This feature is retained irrespective of the mutation of three critical residues N501Y, E484K, K417T, and either of the combination, but it is to be noted the putative bond type varied with the combination of the type of mutation as putative strong hydrogen bond is seen in the case of N501Y mutated UK variant B.1.1.7. Moreover, there is disproportionate favourability for residue Tyr 449 for the other two ligands Imino-chitosan and SCOS. Since mutation at N501Y and E484K observed for P.1 lineage, has favoured Imino-chitosan to form a putative strong hydrogen bond with Tyr 449 (Fig. 8a-c) Overall, it is to be noted that Imino-chitosan loses binding affinity to RBD of B.1.1.7 with a mutation at residue N501Y but this was countered in the case of P.1 variant with all the three mutations N501Y, E484K, and K417T. Moreover, these molecules were docked at lower molecular weight, than their proposed activity range (>3 kDa). On increasing their chain size and restricting the least significant rotatable bonds, higher binding affinity to RBD of S-protein for both wild type and new distinct variants has been noted.",

            "text": "Heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) are receptors present in the cell surface's extracellular matrix, having a copolymeric composition of N-Acetyl-D-glucosamine D-glucuronic acid, which is responsible for the transport of a plethora of macromolecules [41, 42] . However, these assemblies vary in length, size, and expression of cell types impacting their role as primary target receptors for endocytosis [43] of viral particles and tissue tropism characteristics through non-specific binding to viruses and their host cell for infection activation [44] [45] [46] . An abnormal coagulopathy was first reported by Tang et.al in where they conducted a study on 201 patients among which 84 developed Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) with higher prothrombin time (PT) in case of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients [47] . Later multiple studies reported the association between disease severity caused by SARS-CoV-2 and pulmonary embolism. Nonetheless, a study published by Clausenet.al., demonstrated that the HSPG receptors were a necessary cofactor for Table 7 List of hydrogen bonds and other bonds at protein-ligand interfaces targeting ACE2 binding residues of RBD. (Fig. 11) . It observed the occupancy of the homotrimer by ACE2 increased from bearing 5% to 37% for one ACE2 and 21% for two ACE2 for pseudotype virus [14] . This explains the rationale behind the thrombosis in severely infected patients and virulence promoted by HSPGs. So, the use of the non-anticoagulant heparinoids and low molecular weight heparin for treatments protocol has been in the realm. Also, there are studies providing evidence of non-anticoagulant heparinoids and low molecular weight heparin engaged in blocking SARS-CoV-2 infection [14, 48, 49, 50] [14] as the active target site with heparin as +ve control. The fluctuation graph of both wild type (Fig. 5 ) and P.1 (Fig. 6 ) variant shows that the loop 346-358 and 440-457 has significantly low fluctuation which is similar to the critical loop of 484-509 in exposed state RBD complexed with ACE2. In Table 8 , the breakup of all the hydrogen bonds types and other types of interaction formed by the selected moiety has been determined and analysis for each Ligand and conformation models are shown in (Fig. 12a-d) . Intriguingly, the heparinoid-like property of SCOS is seen to be well reserved similar to the interaction between heparin disaccharide I -S and RBD. As there is the overlap of residues interaction common between heparin disaccharide I -S and sulfated-chitosan oligosaccharide and the types of bonds formed. Also, that low molecular SCOS has been reported to possess antiviral properties against HIV-1 [17] and the use of low molecular weight heparin as prophylactic treatment for severely infected has aided in reduced mortality from coagulopathy [51, 52] . However, heparin's use comes with safety concerns in association with toxicity. So, lower toxicity analogues with antiviral properties such as SCOS have the potential therapeutic advantage in this regard. Moreover, it was observed that sulfation atthe amino and 6-hydroxyl groups had superior activity than the 3-hydroxyl group, which was also reported by Clausen et al. [14] . This characteristic is well reserved in the case of SCOS. Moreover, the other two ligands N-benzoyl-O-acetyl-chitosan and Imino-chitosan also have significant putative binding affinity to the corresponding residues in the loop of interest. Also, it can be arguably concluded that the backbone of N-acetyl glucosamine had a significant contribution to the binding affinity of RBD to chitosan derivatives along with the substrate chain for both in the case of heparinoid and non-heparinoids besides the added advantage to have similar effects on variants. Although there has been mutation at N501Y, E484K, and K417T for P.1 variant and N501Y for B.1.1.7 yet there was no notable geometric or orientation change in RBD with respect to the wild type which doesn't impede the putative binding affinity of the proposed ligands.",

            "text": "Main protease (M pro ) is a three-domain cysteine protease also known as 3C-Like protease domain (3CL pro ) with a chymotrypsin-like two domain folds at N terminus present all CoVs. They protease mediates the maturation of CoVs by involving in most of the maturation process that occurs in cleavage events within the precursor polyprotein pp1a and pp1ab [53, 54] . So they are essential along with Papain-like protease for the extensive proteolytic processing that liberates the functional polypeptides from the polyproteins. The M pro (3CL pro ) cleaves the polyprotein at 11 conserved sites involving Leu-Gln (Ser, Ala, Gly) sequences in HCoV-229E [55] . It cleaves two overlapping polyproteins [pp1a (replicase 1a, ~450 kD) and pp1ab (replicase 1ab, ~750 kD) to functional proteins, which is an essential step in viral replication was observed in 33.1 kDa HCoV-229E key proteinase activity [56] . Later a study report by Zhang et al., suggested that there was a 96% sequence identity between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 and that the M pro was involved 11 cleavage sites on the larger polyproteins pp1ab Leu-Gln (Ser, Ala, Gly) making it an attractive antiviral drug target for SARS-CoV-2 [57, 58] . So to elucidate the potential antiviral against M pro by the three ligands of interest N-benzoyl-O-acetyl-chitosan, Iminochitosan, and antiviral SCOS we did molecular docking at the putative binding site of Boceprevir. They demonstrated Boceprevir, and GC376, both efficaciously inhibit SARS-CoV-2 with EC 50 of 15.57 \u03bcM and 0.70 \u03bcM in Vero cells by targeting the Main protease. To elucidate the mechanism, it was observed that Boceprevir had a putative hydrogen bond formation at the catalytically active site of SARS-CoV-2 Main protease as the main mechanism of inhibition space between the residues His41, Met49, Tyr54, Asn142-Cys145, His164-Glu166. Although GC376 had a potent inhibition than Boceprevir but had limitations in clinical perspective [21] . Detrimental side effects are seen in animal teeth in prospective with longer than 2 or more weeks [59, 60] . Table 9 and Fig. 13 summarized the putative bonds formed by Borceprevir. In perspective to the ligands of interest, Imino-chitosan and N-benzyl-Oacetyl-chitosan had a high binding affinity at the catalytically active site of main proteases (Table 9 and Fig. 14a-b) . However, the most notable ligand Imino-chitosan has a similar strong binding affinity towards the residue Glu166 that of Boceprevir.",

The free/bound transfer of a drug from one compartment to another is known as drug delivery. Regional blood flow patterns, molecular size, polarity, and binding to serum proteins, which form a complex, are all factors that influence drug delivery. Drug metabolism occurs as a result of a variety of biological reactions that turn the drug into an inactive or more active form. This research is carried out to track the impact of a drug on particular metabolic pathways by measuring metabolite levels after it has been administered. This helps to build a full picture of a drug's impact on metabolism and pathways that are linked to the mechanism of treatment response variance. The excretion of metabolized drugs is just as significant as the other three aspects. ADME values of test ligands have been compiled in Table 11 .",

The acceptable range of computational BBB for an ideal drug candidate is \u2212 3.0 to 1.2 All three ligands perfectly fit the necessity.

Further ahead, the values of PPB% (Plasma Protein Binding) would analyze drug binding to plasma protein as a key distribution in the system. The higher the value, the more difficult it becomes for the drug to detach from the tightly bound protein and release in the system.

            "text": "Although SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the class of Betacoronaviruses of lineage Sarbecovirus, there is a significant difference in the choice of receptors for each of the viruses from subclass Sarbecovirus. In a study led by Bate et al., the monoclonal antibodies against the specific structural proteins of the SARS-CoV virus were studied and characterized against the similar targets of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The striking structural similarity between Envelope, Membrane and Nucleocapsid proteins as 96%, 91%, and 91% respectively were reserved for both the viruses. However, binding affinity analysis of potent mAbs CR3022 against the full-length spike protein and its RBD region showed partial neutralization of the spike protein. Other antibodies tested failed to present comparable binding affinity and neutralization properties. This could be due to changes in the residues of spike protein between two viruses [61] . Another study shed light on the cross-reactive antibodies observed in the pre-pandemic healthy donors against the S1 antigen of SARS-CoV-2 virus. This shows how conserved protein residues across various \"common cold\" related coronaviruses have been significant in kindling the immune system against the novel COVID-19 virus [62] . Along similar lines, it was observed that antibodies from the serum of mildly affected and naive COVID-19 patients showed cross-reactivity to seasonal coronavirus, HCoV NL-63, relatively higher in the latter case [63] . Although HCoV NL63 belongs to alpha coronaviruses. It happens to have a similar choice of receptor i.e., is ACE2 for cellular entry mechanism [64] . Interpreting the milk samples for the antibodies against S1 and S2 subunits of spike protein in the COVID-19 positive mothers put forward insightful results. The COVID-19 infected mothers' milk showed high levels of HCoV-OC43 reactive IgG antibodies. Moreover, observing high IgM levels reactive to SARS-CoV-2, S1 subunit, and S1 + S2 subunits of HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-229E in two unexposed mothers suggest the presence of cross-reactive antibodies against human coronaviruses which could be due to similarity in epitopes on S1 and S2 subunits that are recognized by human milk antibodies [65] . Other reports supporting cross-reactive immunity by another study where low antibody titers against HCoV-EMC were reported in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. The bioinformatic analysis reflected overlapping regions in the spike protein for both viruses [66] . Through the development of a multi-CoV antibody panel test, it was noted that there exists a positive correlation between the SARS-CoV-2 immune response and high hCoV responses which could be due to similar host-pathogen interactions and viral proteins mode of action. It was observed that people have preexisting immunity to human \u03b1-(NL63 and 229E) and \u03b2-hCoVs (OC43 and HKU1) strains irrespective of their COVID-19 infection status and the same gets augmented post-SARS-CoV-2 infection due to crossreactivity to spike trimer [67] . Quantification of pre-pandemic antibody levels in human serum samples revealed the presence of antibodies against HCoV virus and the same got amplified post-COVID-19 infection. A decent percentage of these antibodies cross-reacted with SARS-CoV-2 spike and nucleocapsid proteins but were not found to be associated with protection against SARS-CoV-2 hospitalizations or infections [68] . All these studies emphasize the overlapping of structural protein residues in different coronaviruses strains to some extent. However, a more concrete investigation is required to conclude something in this context. Based on what has come to the attention till date, the top three performers of this study ensure some degree of reactivity to the proteins of other coronavirus strains and thus, vouching for wide utility as a therapeutic intervention for future pandemics by the coronavirus family.",

Lys 353 (ACE2) seen to form a hydrogen bond with Gln 496 and Tyr 502, Tyr 505. However, according to Ali and Vijayan's Molecular dynamics simulations, Lys 353 of ACE2 forms hydrogen with Gln 498 of SARS-CoV-2[34]contributing to the binding affinity between SARS-CoV-2-RBD and ACE2(Fig. 3). The contacts formed between hotpots residues Lys 31 and Lys 353 of ACE2 provide low fluctuation in loop Tyr 484-Tyr 505 of RBD of SARS-CoV-2 determined using CABS flex 2.0 package. This observation(Fig. 4)is in agreement with the Molecular dynamics simulations done by Ali and Vijayan[34]. c) Stable hydrogen bond between Tyr 449 of RBD and Asp 38 of ACE2 has been another significant contributor to the virulence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus[34]. Also, this hydrogen bond is aided by a hydrogen bond formed between Tyr 449 of RBD and Gln 42 of ACE2. d) Lastly the outer salt bridge formed by Lys 417 of SARS-CoV-2 has been one of the striking feature contributing to its higher binding affinity to ACE2 receptor(Fig. 3)[11,34,35]. This salt bridge was supported by an attractive charge between the hotspot residue Lys 31 and Glu 484.Furthermore, recent developments of highly contagious new variants such as the B.1.1.7, B.1.351, and P.1 lineage have surfaced with new concerns. In December of 2020, Chand et al. submitted the first report of sequence detection of the B.1.1.7 variant, which contributes to the latest rise in cases by 40-80% and became one of the dominant variants",
