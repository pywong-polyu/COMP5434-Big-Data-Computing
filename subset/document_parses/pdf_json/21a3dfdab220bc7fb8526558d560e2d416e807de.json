The virus cannot survive outside of its hosts and hypothetically utilizes the hosts machinery by attaching to A-like (O-GalNAc\u03b11-Ser/Thr-R, Tn) antigenic structure via serine rich motifs [8] . While the attachment of the virus to the host occurs independent of the ABO blood group, patients with blood group \"A\" cannot respond with either innate or acquired antibodies to the synthesis of the hybrid \"A\" structure due to clonal selection and phenotypic, glycosidic accommodation of plasma proteins. Hence, patients with blood group \"A\" would be natural targets for the coronavirus. A study from China by Zhao first reported a relationship between ABO blood groups and COVID-19 infection from three hospitals in Wuhan, in which blood group A was associated with a greater risk for COVID-19 infection with respect to the general population [2] . This is supported by a genomewide association study from Europe with 835 patients compared to 1,255 controls that found evidence for greater risk of infection in patients with blood type A, based on signal transmission densities at the ABO blood group loci [9] . Work by Li et al on patients in China found a greater representation of patients with type A blood type, supporting this hypothesis [3] .",

In addition, no significant difference was appreciated with respect to ABO/ Rh groups and summative LOS (Kruskal-Wallis, P = 0.933).

After further separation of ABO and Rh factors (Supplemental Material 3, www.jocmr.org), logistic regression analysis failed to demonstrate a mortality relationship with ABO blood type and was consistent in pairwise comparison after P value correction (Supplementary Material 4, www.jocmr.org).

There were significant differences in the ABO groups with respect to age (Kruskal-Wallis, P = 0.0001), body mass index (BMI) (Kruskal-Wallis, P = 0.027), and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) (Kruskal-Wallis, P = 0.007). Significant difference was also appreciated in the Rh groups with respect to age (Kruskal-Wallis, P = 0.013), and a tendency towards significance with respect to hypertension (Chi2, P = 0.069). Potential confounding factors identified above were further evaluated by logistic regression in two different models: 1) between the COVID-19 and control populations to elucidate the relationship between these potential confounders and their effect on the ABO/Rh distribution; and 2) within the COV-ID-19 population with respect to mortality, and are shown in Table 4 . Between the COVID-19 and control populations, age and sex remained statistically significant, with older age (OR: 1.008, CI: 1.002 -1.015, P = 0.014) and male sex (OR: 1.85, CI: 1.446 -2.367, P < 0.001) more heavily represented in the COVID-19 population with respect to the control population. No significant difference was appreciated with respect to ABO or Rh groups. Within the COVID-19 population, greater mortality was seen in: older patients (odds: 1.05, CI: 1.037 -1.067, P < 0.001); males (odds: 1.64, CI: 1.07 -2.49, P = 0.022); those with a greater BMI (odds: 1.05, CI: 1.021 -1.088, P = 0.001); and greater HbA1c levels (odds: 1.16, CI: 1.061 -1.261, P = 0.001). ABO blood group failed to show significance in difference in representation between COVID-19 and control populations or with respect to mortality after accounting for potential confounding factors. While Rhesus factor did show a tendency toward significant difference in representation between COVID-19 and control populations, a tendency towards lower mortality in Rh negative patients was appreciated (odds: 0.448, CI: 0.185 -1.067, P = 0.070) but failed to reach the predetermined statistically significant mark.",
