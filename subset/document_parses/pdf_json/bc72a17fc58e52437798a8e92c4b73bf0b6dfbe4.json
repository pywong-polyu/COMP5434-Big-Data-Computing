Recent knowledge of trained immunitybased vaccines (TIbV), such as the sublingual polybacterial formulation MV130, has shown a promising strategy in the management of patients with recurrent infections. We sought to determine the clinical benefit of MV130 in a cohort of HM patients with recurrent respiratory tract infections (RRTIs) who underwent immunization with MV130 for 3 months. Clinical information included the frequency of infections, antibiotic use, number of visits to the GP and hospitalizations previous and after MV130 immunotherapy. Improvement on infection rate was classified as: clear (>60% reduction of infection), partial (26%-60%) and low (\u226425%) improvement. Fifteen HM patients (aged 42 to 80 years; nine females) were included in the study. All patients reduced their infection rate. Analysis of paired data revealed that the median (range, min -max) of respiratory infectious rate significantly decreased from 4.0 (8.0-3.0) to 2.0 (4.0-0.0) (p<0.001) at 12 months of MV130. A clear clinical improvement was observed in 53% (n = 8) of patients, partial improvement in 40% (n = 6) and low improvement in 7% (n = 1). These data correlated with a decrease on antibiotic consumption from 3.0 (8.0-1.0) to 1.0 (2.0-0.0) (p = 0.002) during 12 months after initiation of treatment with MV130. The number of infectiousrelated GP or emergency room visits declined from 4.0 (8.0-2.0) to 2.0 (3.0-0.0) (p<0.001), in parallel with a reduction in hospital admissions due to infections (p = 0.032). Regarding safety, no adverse events were observed.

In INTRODUCTION B cell hematological malignancies (HM) are a diverse group of hematological diseases where both the disease and the use of B cell therapies contribute to secondary immunodeficiency (SID) (1) . HM patients are particularly prone to recurrent and severe infections (2, 3) , which may result in prolonged hospital admissions, increases in healthcare costs and second-line drugs, treatment failures and subsequent, patient's fragility and reduced quality of life (4, 5) . Antibiotic prophylaxis is the mainstay of management in patients with recurrent infections (6, 7) . However, the advent of multidrug resistance among pathogenic bacteria poses a serious global threat of growing concern (8-10). Moreover, the use of antibiotics in recurrent infections might have: i) deleterious effects on the microbiota, such as an enhancement of pathogen invasion; ii) potential adverse effects, including nephrotoxicity and hepatotoxicity; and, iii) limitations for treating diverse microorganisms. In addition, in the particular case of respiratory tract infections, influenza and other viral pathogens are the most common causes of acute respiratory infections, predisposing patients to secondary bacterial infections often leading to more severe clinical outcomes. Therefore, the development of alternative strategies or adjuvant approaches are a priority for preventive purposes (11) .",

Trained immunity is described as a long-term (up to 1-year) boosting of innate immune responses by certain pathogens or pathogen-associated molecular patterns, including specific vaccines, which leads to heterologous protection against infection through epigenetic, transcriptional and functional reprograming of innate immune cells (13) . Therefore, trained immunity-based vaccines (TIbV) provide the potential for identifying novel therapeutic targets that protect from infections and reverse immunotolerant states (14) . TIbV enhance and induce long lasting epigenetic changes in innate immune cells, enabling quicker clearance of microbial infections (15) . Thus, we foresee that sublingual mucosal TIbV could represent a good adjuvant or alternative to antibiotics as a prophylactic intervention.",

In addition, it was successfully used in a clinical trial in children with recurrent wheezing, a condition triggered in most cases by viral infections (22) . Its immunomodulatory mechanism of action has been further studied in vitro and in vivo (23, 24) . MV130 is a mucosal TIbV used to prevent infections in patients with recurrent infections without known immunodeficiency, but also may have that role in immunocompromised patients (25, 26) . Mucosal TIbVs act directly on specific tissues where pathogens initiate or spread infections, decreasing the number of reinfections and also inducing tolerance (23, 27) .

Excluding the MGUS paraprotein subgroup (n = 7), three patients (38%) had received one cycle chemotherapy (4-6 weeks), four patients (50%) at least two cycles and one (12%) patient received one cycle chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplant. During the follow-up period, the HM remained stable in all patients. According to previous hematological history, one patient of the CLL group was splenectomized secondary to refractory autoimmune haemolytic anemia (AHAI). Seven patients out of 15 (47%) required IgRT due to severe immunosuppression 15 \u00b1 4 months post-MV130; six of them on intravenous immunoglobulin (200 mg/kg) and the other on subcutaneous immunoglobulin (300 ml/monthly). Four out of these seven patients (57%) had received more than one cycle of conventional chemotherapy after HM diagnosis and years before MV130, except for one patient who had a diagnosis of MGUS and pulmonary lymphangiomatosis who also required IgRT due to recurrent infections. The remaining untreated patients (non-IgRT) belonged to the MGUS group (n = 6) and NHL group (n = 2). An interesting fact is that one of the NHL patients had indication of IgRT -because of Ig levels below 300 mg/dl and antibody production defect -, and refused to start IgRT, but remained asymptomatic from the infectious perspective after receiving MV130.",

Our data show a significant reduction in the frequency rate of RRTIs in the following 12 months of initiating the vaccine. Moreover, three patients that concomitantly suffered from recurrent urinary tract infections did not show any sign of urinary infection during the 12-month follow-up period, highlighting the broad-spectrum of protection conferred by MV130 (15) . The clinical benefit of this approach might be probably the highest early at HM diagnosis, when the tumor burden is low and before tumor progression has resulted in profound immune exhaustion (12) . Mucosal TIbVs induce an immune response that more closely resembles natural immunity than the response elicited by injectable vaccines. Thus, mucosal routes of immunization are better alternatives than parenteral immunization to enhance immunity in tissues such as lung mucosa (32) . Our results show clinical improvement of respiratory tract infections after MV130 immunization on five out of six patients with basal bronchiectasis. This fact might be supported by previous studies that demonstrate that Th17 T-cell response enhanced endobronchial clearance in COPD patients following oral immunization (33) . In this line, among the mechanisms of actions previously described for MV130, it has been demonstrated that it enhances both specific and non-specific T cell responses in vitro and in vivo, including Th1 and Th17 immune responses (23) .",

Prevalence of viral infections in HM patients is high and can deteriorate the patient's condition and disrupt the treatment process. For that reason, the prevention and treatment of respiratory viral infections in cancer patients are of great importance. In this line, the efficacy of MV130 was highlighted in a clinical trial in children with recurrent wheezing, a condition triggered in most cases by viral infections (respiratory syncytial virus and rhinovirus primarily, but also by others such as flu virus or coronavirus). In that trial, a significant decrease in the number and duration of wheezing attacks, together with a reduction in symptoms and medication score was assessed in MV130 group over placebo (22) . It has been postulated that a trained immunity-mediated mechanism might be underlying the protection conferred by MV130 in this clinical trial. In our cohort, a patient who presented with recurrent herpes simplex infections (7 episodes prior to MV130), did not show any recurrence of herpes during the 12-months follow-up period following sublingual vaccination, which suggests that the bacterial preparation may have induced an immune stimulating effect that enhanced the ongoing cellular immune response to viral antigens (19) . Indeed, in a former report where 17 adult patients with RRTIs and suspected primary immunodeficiency were treated with MV130 for 6 months, one of those subjects presented 12 episodes of labial and nasal herpes virus prior to MV130 mucosal immunotherapy, this number decreased to three episodes during the year following the beginning of the immunotherapy (19) .",

HM patients often present very low antibody production associated with an increased frequency of severe or recurrent infection. Despite the inherent antibody defect observed in our cohort of HM patients, a significant MV130-specific IgA and IgG serum titers, together with and increased in pathogen-specific IgA and IgG levels of bacterial strains contained in the bacterial preparation, were detected following MV130 mucosal immunotherapy. These results highlight the ability of sublingual MV130 administration to induce an immunogenic response against MV130-containing bacteria in these low-responder patients. Of note, these bacterial strains are among the most common pathogens of the respiratory tract. Therefore, supporting a specific as well as a non-specific protective role of MV130. These results are one of the main strengths of this study, we believe it may be somehow underlying the mechanism of protection conferred by MV130 reducing the recurrence of infection in these patients. Furthermore, these data support a recently published report where patients with common variable immunodeficiency that received MV130 immunotherapy declined their rate of respiratory infections in parallel with an increase in MV130-specific IgA serum antibodies (26) . The potential of MV130 to offer certain protection to infection by the recent SARS-CoV-2 virus in this population would also be interesting to explore.",

Recently, trained immunity-based vaccines have been described as anti-infectious vaccines composed of whole microorganisms or derived products that induce trained immunity and confer heterologous protection (15) . Several effects of TIbVs have been described, including different molecular mechanisms such as a metabolic switch from oxidative phosphorylation to aerobic glycolysis, epigenetic reprogramming of innate immune cells and enhancement of T-cell adaptive responses (35) . Long-lasting epigenetic changes in innate immune cells may be effective not only against the specific pathogens targeted by the vaccine but also to improve immune responses to possible bystander pathogens, acquiring a higher resistance to a second infection (cross-protection) for a relatively prolonged time period (11) . In addition, clinical studies have pointed out trained immunity as a novel approach to enhance responses against infection and vaccination in the elderly and other vulnerable populations when innate immune cells display functional defects, such as decrease in the phagocytosis and cytokine production, and adaptive immune cells exhibit defective antibody production and/or a decline in na\u00efve cell population (36) . Certain bacterial preparations that have previously demonstrated clinical benefit reducing recurrent infections such as MV130, have been postulated as TIbVs for their ability to promote host resistance against a wide spectrum of pathogens (19, 21, 25, 26) . In this regard, we have not evaluated the ability of MV130 to induce trained immunity in the cohort of patients studied, but we have rather assessed an increase in antibody production. Whether trained immunity, antibody responses or both mechanisms are underlying the protection conferred by MV130 in this setting needs further evaluation. The MV130 vaccine has been used for more than 10 years in Spain financed by the National Security Health System, and there is a large amount of available data on its safety and in different populations (19, 21, 22, 26) . Although our study is limited by the small cohort of our HM patients, the retrospective design and the absence of a control group, our results are very encouraging as preliminary data. However, future properly designed clinical trials including sample size calculation and exclusion of confusion factors, such as IgRT usage, are needed to validate the utility of MV130 in SID diagnosis.",

This has been proven in previous studies carried out with MV130 where direct costs such as surgery, cycles of antibiotics, hospitalization and indirect costs such as work/ school absenteeism, among others, have been assessed (21, 26) . Therefore, providing an additional advantage for this interventional approach.",

(A, C) Percentage of improvement (reduction of infections) (A-tabulated, C-pie chart). Improvement was classified as: clear (>60% reduction of infectious episodes), partial (26-60% reduction of infectious episodes) and low (<25% reduction of infectious episodes). A total of 15 patients were included. Normal distribution was evaluated using Shapiro-Wilk test, and P value was calculated comparing infectious episodes pre and post immunotherapy with MV130 using Wilcoxon signed rank test. Prophylaxis with MV130 increases serum specific IgA antibody production. Serum IgA specific antibodies against (A) MV130 (bacterial mixture), (B) S. epidermidis, (C) S. aureus, (D) S. pneumoniae, (E) H. influenzae, (F) M. catarrhalis and (G) K. pneumoniae were quantified from patients before immunotherapy with MV130 (Pre), and 4 to 41 months after initiation of immunotherapy with MV130 (Post). Levels of antibodies were determined by ELISA. Sera samples from a total of 13 patients were included.
