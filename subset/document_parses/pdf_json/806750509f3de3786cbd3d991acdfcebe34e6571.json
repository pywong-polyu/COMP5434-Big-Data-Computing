sensitive serology assays to define exposure to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Methods: Pooled plasma samples from PCR positive COVID-19 patients were used to identify linear B-cell epitopes from a SARS-CoV-2 peptide library of spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N) structural proteins by peptide-based ELISA. Hit epitopes were further validated with 79 COVID-19 patients with different disease severity status, 13 seasonal human CoV, 20 recovered SARS patients and 22 healthy donors. Findings: Four immunodominant epitopes, S14P5, S20P2, S21P2 and N4P5, were identified on the S and N viral proteins. IgG responses to all identified epitopes displayed a strong detection profile, with N4P5 achieving the highest level of specificity (100%) and sensitivity (>96%) against SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, the magnitude of IgG responses to S14P5, S21P2 and N4P5 were strongly associated with disease severity. Interpretation: IgG responses to the peptide epitopes can serve as useful indicators for the degree of immunopathology in COVID-19 patients, and function as higly specific and sensitive sero-immunosurveillance tools for recent or past SARS-CoV-2 infections. The flexibility of these epitopes to be used alone or in combination will allow for the development of improved point-of-care-tests (POCTs).", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "The ongoing pandemic caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) [1] has resulted in more than 4.5 million confirmed human infection cases in 213 countries, with a global mortality rate of almost 7% [2] , which has led to partial or total confinement of various countries. This unprecedented crisis has generated major socio-economic disruptions worldwide, overwhelming healthcare systems in both developed and developing countries. While quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR) remains as a gold standard for the early detection of SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals, the incidence of false negative diagnosis due to insufficient viral genetic material at the point of detection has limited such molecularbased assays [3] . Although rapid tests to detect acute infections are crucial in light of the current pandemic, it is also necessary to develop efficient assays for the detection of exposure in order to successfully mitigate virus transmission. Thus, there is an imperative need to rapidly develop highly specific and sensitive serology-based approaches to confirm molecular diagnosis, and enable immunosurveillance to identify individuals with recent or past exposure to SARS-CoV-2.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 92, "end": 95, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 226, "end": 229, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 752, "end": 755, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "To date, several studies and pre-prints have described serological assays to detect SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies in patient blood specimens [3\u00c07] .

The wealth of findings from these studies has shed some light on the general humoral response upon SARS-CoV-2 infection, where anti-SARS-CoV-2-IgM and IgG are detectable as early as 3 and 4 days post-illness onset (pio), respectively [3, 7] . Given the seasonal circulation of several human coronaviruses (hCoV) including 229E, OC43, NL63 and HKU1, which are responsible for common cold [9] , coupled with individuals who have prior exposure to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) during the outbreak in 2003 [10] , cross-reactivity amongst these genetically similar viruses is inevitable, which may lead to confounding detection outcomes when using recombinant proteins (sharing high homology) [11] . Furthermore, the use of recombinant proteins, in addition to high costs and storage constraints, may give rise to batch-to-batch variations, which would greatly affect the reproducibility of immunoassays [12] . Thus, it remains crucial to ascertain the specificity and sensitivity profiles for the development of efficient and precise immunoassays.

In this study, four immunodominant IgG-specific SARS-CoV-2 linear epitopes, S14P5, S20P2, S21P2 and N4P5, located on the S and N viral proteins were described. The S and N antigens are immunodominant amongst coronavirus antigens, and are commonly used in the development of serological assays against coronaviruses [5, 8, 27] . Sequences of these epitopes are well conserved across multiple SARS-CoV-2 strains [21] (Supplementary Table 4 ), with no detectable cross-reactivity against seasonal hCoV and recovered SARS individuals, despite a high level of homology with the corresponding regions on SARS-CoV (Table 2 ) [11] . Moreover, sequences of several identified epitopes overlap either completely or partially with reported SARS-CoV B-cell linear epitopes at regions QQFGRD in S14P5, FIEDLLFNKVTLADAGF in S21P2, and QLPQGTTLPKG in N4P5 [28] . Corroborating a recent study, no response was also detected against the SARS-CoV S protein by recovered SARS patients who were infected 17 years ago [21] , suggesting that antibodies against SARS-CoV linear epitopes are shortlived [29] . As there is currently no active SARS-CoV transmission, it remains elusive whether antibodies against SARS-CoV would react with these immunodominant SARS-CoV-2 epitopes and generate false positive responses.

This remains as one of the current limitation in the development of POCTs based on single SARS-CoV-2 proteins. Furthermore, the use of recombinant proteins may lead to false positive results and hamper specificity of the immune-based assays due to high level of cross-reactivities between SARS-CoV-2 and other human coronaviruses such as the closely-related SARS-CoV [11, 24, 30] . For instance, in a hypothetical scenario, a test that is 90% specific and 100% sensitive is used to screen a population of 10,000 persons without COVID-19 and 100 persons with COVID-19.

Moreover, the use of high purity peptide-based immunoassays can overcome batch-to-batch inconsistencies resulting from variations in protein refolding and storage stability. Although the samples screened in this study were collected at median 10 days pio (with hospital admission of median 5 days pio), the value of developing POCTs with these immunodominant IgG epitopes would still be useful in identifying undiagnosed asymptomatic carriers.

One plausible hypothesis for these associations is that severe patients had a higher viral load during the early infection phase that resulted in higher antibody responses. While a causality link between antibody response and enhanced severity remains to be determined, it is also possible that high specific-antibody levels may contribute to an enhanced lung inflammation in COVID-19 patients. Such an observation was reported in SARS-CoVinfected monkeys treated with an anti-S protein monoclonal antibody [37] . In addition, there could also be a higher level of non-neutralising antibody responses in severe patients that may lead to a detrimental consequence such as antibody dependant enhancement, which was demonstrated in vitro using SARS-CoV patients serum samples [38] .
