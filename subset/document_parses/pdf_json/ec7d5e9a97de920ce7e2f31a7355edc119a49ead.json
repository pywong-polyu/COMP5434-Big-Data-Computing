In children of late we are seeing a peculiar condition called multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C) [1] . Worryingly, some diseases like dengue, rickettsial fever mimic the clinical manifestations of COVID-19. There are reported cases of coinfection of dengue with COVID-19 [2] , and also false positive dengue antibodies in COVID-19 cases [3] . All these are reported in adults. Herein, we report a child with MIS-C and co-infected with dengue virus.",

No history of cough/cold, hurried breathing, chest-indrawing, joint swelling/redness, bleeding manifestations. Examination revealed bilateral conjuctival congestion, facial puffiness, and erythematous macular rashes on palms and soles and tender hepatomegaly. Other systems were unremarkable except variable heart rate. Complete blood count (CBC) with maximum and minimum counts was as follows, leukocyte counts [12,900/cmm (P: 43%, L: 43%) and 7700/cmm (P: 78%, L: 15%)], platelets (411,000/cmm and 96,000/ cmm) and hematocrit (29.9% and 25.3%). Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for SARS-CoV-2 was positive and serology for COVID-19 showed raised immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody titer. Inflammatory markers were raised [C-reactive protein (CRP) > 90 mg/dL, ferritin 157 ng/mL, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) 257 U/L, D-dimer 2793 ng/mL]. Ultrasound imaging of the abdomen showed minimal ascites with hepatomegaly. 2D echo showed globally hypokinetic left ventricular (LV) dysfunction with an ejection fraction of 30%. Dengu immunoglobulin M (IgM) was positive by IgM antibody-capture enzymelinked immunosorbent assay (MAC-ELISA).",
