The case of ritonavir-boosted lopinavir early in the pandemic serves as a cautionary tale: despite tenuous evidence suggesting clinical effectiveness in treating COVID-19, ritonavir-boosted lopinavir had an eight-fold increase in hospital use between March and April, 2020. 1 Mirroring this increase, there was a sharp rise in higher priced shipments of ritonavir's active pharmaceutical ingredient exported from India (appendix). The market for the active pharmaceutical ingredient of ritonavir largely settled by October, 2020, but the expectation that ritonavir-boosted lopinavir would be effective in treating COVID-19 probably had downstream effects on supply and availability. These mere expectations produced the observed market disruptions (appendix). Convincing data or an Emergency Use Authorization could increase market uncertainty, volatility, and prices.",

The business practice wherein companies renege on earlier contracts with LMICs to redirect sales at increased prices to high-income countries is well documented.",

Increased demand could exacerbate affordability challenges. Ritonavir has a long history of access challenges, as evidenced by the numerous times governments issued compulsory licenses to overcome patent monopolies (eg, Tajikistan, 2005; China, 2007; Thailand, 2007; and Indonesia, 2012). 7 In March, 2020, Israel issued a compulsory license for ritonavir-boosted lopinavir for the treatment of COVID-19 because AbbVie and its authorised importer were unable to supply requested quantities. 8 The volume of ritonavir that could be diverted to the COVID-19 market is large. Pfizer has claimed that they can supply 80 million treatment courses of ritonavirboosted PF-07321332 by the end of 2022. Ritonavir is used for HIV treatment by over 1 million adults and 500 000 children in LMICs and has wider effects by preventing transmission. 9 Thus, access to ritonavirboosted PF-07321332 for the treatment of COVID-19 must be pursued alongside maintaining the care for people living with HIV. To ensure anticipation of and planning for potential shortages, we propose the following five actions.",

Particular focus must be given to paediatric antiretroviral markets, which are likely to be disproportionately affected by capacity and price shocks because they account for smaller volumes than adult markets. Existing forums such as the Antiretroviral Procurement Working Group could be an efficient convening mechanism. The unusual supply visibility, centralisation, and predictability of the antiretroviral market should be leveraged to ensure continuity in deliveries. For example, procurers with high volumes of security stock could amend delivery dates on contracts so that manufacturers can service orders to those with more immediate need first.",
