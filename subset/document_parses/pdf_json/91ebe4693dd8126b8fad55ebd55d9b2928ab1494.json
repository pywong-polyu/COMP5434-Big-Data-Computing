There are specific upper limits for arm circumference for each cuff size. Arm circumference is not typically recorded in the EHR for adults. BMI is readily available in most EHR and may be a promising surrogate variable for arm circumference due to the high reported correlation (r = 0.74-0.86) [6] [7] [8] [9] . However, few articles report on the relationship between arm circumference and BMI in the general population. A majority of the prior studies were conducted in the context of malnutrition, had BMI as the outcome, or were among youth populations [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] . One study used a nationally representative data sample and developed sex-specific predictive equations for arm circumference using age, height and weight as input variables [13] . The predictive equations, which included interaction terms, achieved agreements ~80% for correct BP cuff selection, though the accuracy was much lower for the small adult cuff (10-54%) than for the larger sized cuffs (74-88%).",

This provided the BMI threshold (x) with the best sensitivity and specificity profile for the higher end of the arm circumference range (e.g. arm circumference of 44 cm for a large adult cuff). An American Heart Association (AHA) Scientific Statement recommends the following arm circumference ranges for cuff sizes: 22-26 cm for a small adult cuff; 27-34 cm for an adult cuff; 35-44 cm for a large adult cuff [4, 5] . We selected three-arm circumference cutpoints in agreement with these recommendations: (1) \u226426 cm vs. >26 cm, (2) \u226434 cm vs. >34 cm and (3) \u226444 cm vs. >44 cm. We included an additional arm circumference cutpoint of \u226442 cm vs. >42 cm because this is the upper limit for commonly available, over-the-counter BP monitors [15] . We report the BMI threshold for each arm circumference value that maximized Youden's index. Youden's index identifies the optimal decision threshold of the predictor variable that balances sensitivity and specificity [16] . Therefore, the predicted BMI thresholds represent the equivalent of the higher end of an arm circumference range for a given cuff size when the sum of sensitivity and specificity are maximized [16] . We also calculated the c-statistic, a measure of concordance or goodness-of-fit for the prediction of arm circumference by BMI. We performed internal validation using a bootstrap resampling approach with 1000 samples to estimate the mean optimal BMI threshold based on Youden's index for each arm circumference cutpoint.",

The decision rule we developed (see text box) provides a BMI cutoff of 37.0 kg/m 2 to screen patients successfully for a self-monitoring intervention using commercially available cuffs [3] . Previous studies have used arm circumferences to predict BMI (e.g. the converse of our analysis) [6] [7] [8] [9] 11, 12] . A majority of these studies were conducted in the context of predicting malnutrition [6] [7] [8] [9] 12, 17] or the occurrence of underweight patients [11] in predominantly lower and middle-income countries. These studies reported similar high correlations between arm circumference and BMI. A previous study that included a wide range of BMIs found a similar relationship with arm circumference as our cross-sectional study; however, BMI was the outcome of interest, and the arm circumference was the predictor, the opposite of our analysis [17] . One previous study, conducted with National Health and Nutritional Examination Survey data, used multivariable linear regression to account for the linear and nonlinear combinations of age, height and weight, stratified by sex [13] . The predictive equations, which included interaction terms, achieved agreements ~80% for correct BP cuff selection, though the accuracy was much lower for the small adult cuff (10-54%) than for the larger sized cuffs (74-88%). When we applied the equation to the ARIC study population at visit 4, we found a 76% agreement between predicted and measured midarm circumference. Our proposed analysis is more direct; simple with high sensitivity and specificity, uses only one measured variable, proposes dichotomous cut points, and can be applied in real-time without complex calculations during clinic visits.",

            "text": "presents the BMI thresholds by arm circumference cutpoint. The area under the curve was high for each arm circumference cut point. The BMI threshold for a small adult cuff (arm circumference \u226426 cm) was 23.0 kg/m 2 , with a specificity of 89.2%, a sensitivity of 91.3% and a c-statistic of 0.96. An arm circumference of \u226434 cm (adult cuff) had a BMI threshold of 29.2 kg/m 2 with 84.4% sensitivity, 84.0% specificity and a c-statistic of 0.93. The arm circumference cut point of \u226442 cm (common arm circumference cut-off for monitors in the market) had a BMI threshold of 37.0 kg/m 2 with a reported specificity of 94.3%, sensitivity of 95.1% and a c-statistic of 0.98. Lastly, the arm circumference cut point of \u226444 cm (large adult cuff) had a BMI threshold of 37.4 kg/m 2 and specificity, sensitivity and c-statistic of 93.9%, 98.7% and 0.99, respectively. Supplementary Figure 1, Supplemental digital content 1, http://links.lww. com/BPMJ/A148 displays the ROC curves for the four arm circumference cut points. Supplementary Figure 2, Supplement digital content 1, http://links.lww.com/BPMJ/ A148 shows the scatterplot of arm circumference vs. BMI. The BMI thresholds for arm circumference cut points of \u226426 cm, \u226442 cm and \u226444 cm did not differ significantly by age (continuous), sex, race and diabetes status (P for interaction >0.05). The BMI threshold for arm circumference \u226434 cm did not vary statistically significantly by age and race (P for interaction>0.05) but did vary statistically significantly by sex (P for interaction <0.0001). For the arm circumference cut point of <34 cm, males had a BMI threshold of 29.7 kg/m 2 with a sensitivity of 88.3% and a specificity of 78.4%. Females had a BMI threshold of 27.9 kg/m 2 with a sensitivity of 90.8% and a specificity of 85.3%. Supplementary Table 1, Supplemental digital content 1, http://links.lww.com/BPMJ/A148 displays the BMI threshold for each arm circumference cut point by age group, sex and race. The BMI thresholds estimated by bootstrap validation were very similar to the estimates presented above. Supplementary Table 2, Supplement digital content 1, http://links.lww.com/BPMJ/A148 shows the BMI thresholds by arm circumference cut point as estimated by bootstrap validation. Supplementary Table 3, Supplemental digital content 1, http://links.lww.com/BPMJ/A148 shows bootstrap validation estimates for BMI thresholds by subgroups.",
