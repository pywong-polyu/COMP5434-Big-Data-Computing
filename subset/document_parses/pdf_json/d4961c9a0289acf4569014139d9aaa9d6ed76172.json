In the longer term, alcohol's contribution to multiple chronic diseases may mean that sustained increases in consumption could result in health and social costs well beyond the pandemic [2] . Multiple surveys have found increases in self-reported drinking during the pandemic. Results from two national surveys of Canadians found a 6 and 15% net increase in self-reported alcohol use in April and June 2020, respectively [7, 8] . However, surveys on alcohol use have conventionally been shown to dramatically underestimate alcohol consumption, primarily due to non-representative samples and inaccuracy of estimated self-reported alcohol use, and may not correctly capture pandemic-specific changes [9] . Consequently, there is ongoing uncertainty of the degree to which alcohol use has changed in Canada during the pandemic.",

A number of studies have shown that increases in per capita alcohol sales are associated with greater alcohol consumption and harms [10] . A report from British Columbia estimated that the number of standard drinks consumed per capita increased by 7% during March -June 2020 compared to 2019 [11] . Another study from Ontario reported that the value of alcohol sold from the LCBO (a government agency responsible for the majority of alcohol sales in the province) during March -June in 2020 was 16.6% higher than in 2019 [12] . Alcohol sales have also increased in the United States (US) and United Kingdom (UK) during the pandemic. In the US, the mean volume of pure ethanol sold in all off-and on-premise retailers in 12 states in March, April and May 2020 were, respectively, + 2.9%, + 5.7% and \u2212 1.0% compared to the same months in the prior 3 years [13] . Similarly, in the UK, early analyses found the overall value of alcohol sales increased in 2020 compared to previous years [14] . However, there has not been a comprehensive examination of how alcohol sales have changed across Canada during the pandemic [15] . Specifically, data are limited on how both \"on\" and \"off \" premise sales have changed (e.g. sales from both bars and restaurants and liquor stores), whether reported increases in alcohol sales during the early stages of the pandemic have continued over time, if sales are up after adjusting for inflation and growth trends over time and and how sales in regions other than British Columbia and Ontario have changed [16] .",

In Canada, all 13 provinces and territories enacted periods of lockdown including the closure of non-essential business by March 21, 2020 until late April to mid-May 2020 [16] . During these periods of lockdown alcohol stores were designated as an essential service and allowed to remain open [17, 18] . While changes in alcohol sales are of immediate public health interest, comparing changes in alcohol to other retail sales can help isolate pandemic specific effects of alcohol consumption (e.g. did alcohol sales increase because of an overall trend of increased consumer spending or due to factors more specific to alcohol). In this study, we aimed to first understand if alcohol retail sales changed in Canada during the first 9 months of the pandemic. Then, we compared if and to what extent changes in alcohol retail sales differed from changes in sales of other goods and services designated as essential (e.g., groceries) and non-essential (e.g., clothing).",

Among jurisdictions in this study, alcohol is sold in convenience stores in Quebec and in select grocery stores in Ontario, Quebec, and British Columbia. Lastly, the MRTS indirectly captures on-premise (e.g. bars and restaurants) sales as provincial liquor authorities and sampled retailers report sales to establishments licensed to sell alcohol for on-premise consumption [23] .",

For alcohol sales we used the CPI values for on and off-premise alcohol retailers and for essential and non-essential sales we used the overall CPI values. We visualized the average retail sales from each of the six provinces to create a summary value for Canada. For each type of retail sales we calculated the relative percent change in the value of sales for the current year (March to November 2020) compared to the prior three-year average (March -November 2017 -2019). We used segmented linear regression models to estimate the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on changes in the value of alcohol, essential and non-essential sales. Our dependent variable for the three respective models was the monthly value of sales per capita (aged 15+). In order to generate stable time trends, we used all available sales data dating back to January 2010. The models included a binary pandemic indicator, (January 2010 -February 2020 compared to March 2020 -November 2020). The models included two continuous parameters for time; one for the time period before the pandemic and one for the time period during the pandemic. We included categorical variables for both month (12 categories) and province (6 categories) in the models to capture seasonality and differences among the provinces. We also included the percent of the population that is male and percent aged 20-29 as continuous covariates in convention with prior studies examining changes over time in alcohol sales [3] .

In order to understand how changes in the three outcomes (alcohol, essential and non-essential sales) differed, an additional regression model was fit with interaction terms between all variables in the model and the three outcomes. The interaction terms and the three key parameters were interpreted as the difference among outcomes. All tests of significance were two sided and we report 95% confidence intervals from the models. All analyses were conducted in R Version 4.2. Figure 2 presents the per capita value of sales from essential and non-essential stores in the six provinces during the pandemic compared to the average sales of the prior 3 years. Essential and non-essential sales also show seasonal trends. Prior to the pandemic, essential and non-essential sales peaked during May and were at their lowest during January and February. The per capita values of essential and non-essential retail sales during the first 9 months of the COVID-19 pandemic (March -November 2020) were 3.6% greater and 13.1% lower, respectively, than the average values sold during the same time period in in the prior 3 years (March -November 2017-2019).

After adjusting for inflation, all three types of sales showed a significant trend of increasing value of per capita monthly sales over time pre-pandemic. During the first 9 months of the pandemic, we observed a significant level increase in the monthly dollar value of per capita alcohol sales (+$4.86, 95% CIs: 2.88, 6.83) and significant level decreases in the monthly dollar value of per capita essential retail sales (\u2212$59.80, 95% CIs: \u2212 78.47, \u2212 41.03) and non-essential retail sales (\u2212$308.70, 95% CIs: -$326.60, \u2212 290.79). Monthly alcohol sales were increasing at a similar rate pre-pandemic and during the first 9 months of the pandemic. In contrast, the rate of changes in monthly essential and nonessential sales in the first 9 months of the pandemic was greater compared to the pre-pandemic period, reflecting recovery from initial decreases in sales. The level change during the COVID-19 pandemic in alcohol sales was significantly different from the level change for essential (p = 0.006) and non-essential (p < 0.001) sales. The change in slope during the COVID-19 pandemic (secular trend per month) was also significantly different from the level change for essential (p < 0.001) and non-essential (p < 0.001) sales.",

Alcohol sales were consistently elevated compared to prior years. In contrast, the values of per capita essential and non-essential retail sales showed large decreases during the early months of the pandemic before returning to more normal levels of spending. Importantly, the per capita volume of ethanol sold is a well-established indicator of population-level alcohol consumption and an important predictor of alcohol-related harms [26] . We Our results suggest Canadians have purchased and likely consumed moderately more alcohol than usual over the first 9 months of the pandemic. Importantly, we found that the surge in alcohol sales reported at the start of pandemic, thought to represent stockpiling behaviour, was not followed by lower sales in subsequent months [27, 28] . In addition, the sales data which captures sales from both on and off premise channels supports that despite well-documented decreases in sales from bars and restaurants, net sales of alcohol increased during the pandemic [29] .

First, alcohol use may be a maladaptive coping strategy to manage the psychosocial distress from direct and indirect (e.g. job loss) impacts of the pandemic [3, 30] . Second, disruptions to routine and lack of regular schedule which previously constrained alcohol use may promote increased use [30] . Third, reduced access to alternative activities and commodities to alcohol may promote use. Finally, reduced access to preventive services, including reductions in primary care visits [31] and disrupted access to in-person supports, may have decreased access to services that reduce harmful alcohol use. In addition, during the pandemic many regulations and alcohol control policies were relaxed in Canada including allowing home delivery of alcohol from bars and restaurants, increasing the hours of sale from liquor stores, and reducing the price of some types of alcohol [32] . A large body of literature suggests that such changes likely contributed to increases in alcohol use and early reports from the alcohol industry cite new trends such as expanded online and direct to consumer sales as key to increases alcohol sales during this time period [26, 29] .",

Overall spending on services deemed essential by the government was similar to prior years and Canadians spent far less money than usual on retail products designated as nonessential. While our data cannot determine the underlying cause of these consumer behaviours, the findings give greater support to the hypothesis that stressors and other factors related to the COVID-19 pandemic drove increases in alcohol sales. Importantly, problematic alcohol use results in an enormous health and health system burden in Canada and internationally [6, 33] . During the pandemic there was arguably a public health imperative to decrease alcohol use to reduce pressures on the health care system and protect individual mental health [2, 33] . Such a position was supported by the WHO, which recommended that alcohol control policies be maintained or strengthened during the COVID-19 pandemic [34] . Further research can help to better understand which factors may have contributed to both absolute increases in alcohol sales and relative increases compared to other sectors of the economy. Findings can inform policies during the remainder of the COVID-19 pandemic and during future public health emergencies.

            "text": "Our study is one of the first in the literature to report changes in alcohol sales during the COVID-19 pandemic at the population-level. There are three main limitations of our study. First, changes in overall sales may overlook polarization, where some subgroups may increase substance use while others maintain or decrease their use. This possibility is supported by prior evidence from public health emergencies and surveys of Canadians over the course of the pandemic which found that individuals with poor self-reported mental health had greater increases in alcohol consumption than those with good self-reported mental health [35, 36] . Consequently, the moderate population-level changes in alcohol sales in our study may not capture increasing harms and inequities from alcohol in specific subgroups in Canada. Recent work has highlighted particular demographic groups that have experienced a disproportionate burden of emergency department visits due to alcohol in Ontario during the pandemic including those living in rural settings and lower-income neighbourhoods [37] . Second, while a robust body of literature has linked the volume of ethanol per capita sold to per capita consumption and harms, less research has examined the dollar value of alcohol sold. One limitation is that the increased dollar value of alcohol sold could reflect greater volume of sales, a switch to more expensive products, or a combination. Importantly, data from BC which estimated the volume of pure ethanol sold align with our findings [11] . In addition, while an imperfect measure, the value of alcohol sold has been used in several studies and reports to provide timely data on alcohol use during the pandemic [14] . Third, the data in our study only partially account for alcohol sales from supermarkets and convenience stores in Ontario and Quebec. We have likely underestimated changes in alcohol sales in these provinces as grocery stores across Canada reported a 40% increase in alcohol sales during March and April 2020 compared to 2019 [38] . Future work using complete alcohol sales to estimate the volume of alcohol per capita sold and consumed across Canada can determine if and to what extent this current study may have underestimated alcohol retail sales during the pandemic.",

In contrast, non-essential retail purchases showed large declines during the pandemic and spending on other essential goods was consistent with prior years. Increases in alcohol spending compared to maintained or decreased sales from other retail sectors suggest that pandemic related stressors and the associated governmental and societal response had an outsized influence on alcohol sales. Future research should examine factors that may have contributed to increased alcohol sales during the pandemic including specific policy decisions related to alcohol sales.",
