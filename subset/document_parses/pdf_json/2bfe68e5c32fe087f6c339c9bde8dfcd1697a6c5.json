For example, eIC could enable parents to receive study feedback via the eIC system. Requirements were expressed for parental involvement to decide on which feedback would be appropriate to return. Moreover, experts specialized in presenting information and designing electronic systems should be involved. Broad consensus among health care professionals indicates that the face-to-face-interaction between parents and the research team is vital to establish a relationship of trust. Therefore, it is necessary that the use of eIC runs alongside personal interactions with the parents. Concerns were raised about the accessibility of eIC to parents. For this reason, it was suggested that parents should always be given the possibility to read and sign a paper-based informed consent form or to use eIC.",

As a result, these patients may receive medicines outside their marketing authorization, considering their limited clinical evidence pertaining to the efficacy and safety (2, 3) . Over the past years, it has been widely acknowledged that medicinal development for pediatric populations is needed to protect their welfare (1) . In 2007, the Pediatric Regulation came into force in the European Union, establishing a framework to support research and development of medicines for pediatric therapeutic needs (4) . According to an ex-post evaluation, this Regulation has boosted the conduct of pediatric clinical research (5) . In addition, the International Neonatal Consortium (INC) was established in 2015 under a grant from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) (6) . The INC, a global collaboration of key stakeholders such as regulatory agencies, academic researchers, neonatal advocacy groups, pharmaceutical companies and neonatal nurses, aims to foster the therapeutic toolbox for neonates (7) . Unique challenges are related to the conduct of neonatal research. For example, parental decision-making may be impaired when urgently enrolling a neonate with life-threatening conditions in a research study. Therefore, parents could be approached in the antenatal period to convey information on postnatal study enrolment (8) . From an ethical point of view, each participant involved in clinical research needs to be adequately informed during the informed consent (IC) process about what the research study entails. This process is vital to safeguard the participants' well-being, health and rights (9) . When research is conducted in neonates, the IC process needs to inform their legally designated representative(s), often the parents, enabling them to decide on participation in the best interest of their child (10) . In the Netherlands, both parents need to sign the IC (11) . Similarly, both parents need to sign the IC in the United States, except if the institutional review board considers the permission of only parent sufficient. This may concern clinical investigations that do not involve greater than minimal risk or minimal risk with the prospect of direct benefit for the child (12) . However, conflicting approaches to Belgian legal instruments such as the Civil Code and the Law of 7 May 2004 on experiments on human beings emerged (13, 14) . Based upon article 373 of the Civil Code, some suggest that only one parent has to provide IC if both parents are living together. According to the Law of 7 May 2004, IC needs to be obtained from both parents, on the condition that parents have joint custody of their child. As a golden mean, some advice to obtain the signature of at least one parent at the time of recruitment and the written authorization of the other parent along the conduct of the study (15) . In the United Kingdom, the IC from only one parent is required (16) .",

            "text": "However, obtaining IC from parents whose neonate is critically ill may be challenging (3, 17, 18) . For example, parents can feel emotionally distressed or the mother can experience interfering medical conditions such as preeclampsia or postanesthesia (3, 17, 19) . Parents are often overwhelmed and may have a poor understanding of the study-related information when being under time pressure (18, 20) . As a result, they may feel incapable to decide about their neonate's participation in a research study (20) . Key points suggested to improve the IC process are antenatal awareness and discussion, training of those seeking IC, continuing two-way communication and clear and well-regulated information (20) (21) (22) . Related to these key points, advances in technology have resulted in new opportunities to enhance the paper-based IC process (23) . According to the FDA, electronic informed consent (eIC) is defined as \"The use of electronic systems and processes that may employ multiple electronic media, including text, graphics, audio, video, podcasts, passive and interactive Web sites, biological recognition devices, and card readers, to convey information related to the study and to obtain and document IC\" (24) . eIC offers the possibility to present information in a more informative and engaging way by using multimedia tools (25) . Moreover, an eIC system, allowing parents to manage their eIC, could enable researchers to remain in contact with parents over time. For example, study results can be provided to the parents on regular basis, parents can revisit their consent decision or repeated IC discussions can be set up. Additionally, an eIC system could be tailored to the parents' needs and to the research endeavor (26, 27) . Nevertheless, stakeholders, such as research participants and researchers, voiced concerns about access of eIC to specific population groups and data privacy (25) .",

The interview guide was piloted in two interviews and consisted of questions related to the IC process and specifically, the use of paper-based IC forms and eIC. The pilot interviews, conducted with HCPs, were not included in the qualitative analysis. Moreover, open discussion was encouraged to gain an in-depth understanding of interviewees' perspectives. All interviewees received the interview guide in advance in order to prepare themselves for the interview. Interviews were conducted via teleconference from October 2020 until January 2021. Interviews were 30-60 min long. At the start of each semi-structured interview, an electronic slideshow was used to introduce the interviewer, the aim of the study and to provide the definition of eIC, as issued by the FDA (24) . This definition was used to inform interviewees that both conveying information and obtaining parents' signature occur via electronic means when using eIC. Interviews with Belgian and Dutch HCPs were conducted by two researchers (BC and FV, respectively) and were supervised by another researcher (EDS). All interviews were conducted in Dutch and were audio-recorded. Moreover, Dutch quotes were translated to English upon inclusion in the manuscript.",

It was indicated that parents' involvement in the IC process is negatively influenced by a low socioeconomic status and an inadequate understanding of study information. Moreover, the majority of HCPs believed that the timing of seeking IC is not optimal. Distressed and vulnerable parents, who are already overloaded with questions and fear regarding their child's health, may not always have the capacity to process study information.

The question may raise which challenges hinder the widespread adoption of eIC in clinical research involving neonates. Next to these reported by HCPs, such as the use of eIC by parents who lack digital literacy, other challenges could be in place. For example, compliance with national requirements could be challenging. In the Netherlands, the Medical Research Involving Human Subjects Act states that a written, dated and signed IC is needed to participate in scientific research (34) . This Act is currently under revision to include the use of electronic signatures, which is currently not yet allowed (35) . On a Belgian level, a guidance related to the use of eIC in interventional clinical trials was recently issued (36) . The creation of this guidance was coordinated by the Clinical Trial College, an independent body within the Federal Public Service Health, Food Chain Safety and Environment (37) , and developed in collaboration with representatives of the Belgian Association of Research Ethics Committees, the Belgian Association of the Innovative (Bio)pharmaceutical Industry and patient organizations. This guidance provides a framework when using eIC in interventional clinical trials. For example, the research subject should always have the choice between signing a paper-based IC form or signing electronically (36) . Another challenge could be related to the compatibility of eIC systems to interface with software already implemented in the research sites. Resources must be invested to strive for interoperability, which may be costly for a site. Interoperability allows two or more systems to electronically exchange data, and is considered essential for digital innovations for future medicine (38) .",

Greenberg et al. found that parents appreciate the return of results of the study in which their child has taken part (39) . According to interviewed HCPs, parents can be involved to decide on relevant and appropriate information to be shared via an eIC system. The European Foundation for the Care of Newborn Infants (EFCNI) recommends to involve parent representatives during the research process to learn from their experiences related to a specific disease or service. The EFCNI strives to collaborate with parent representatives in various, consecutive phases of the research process, from study protocol development until the dissemination of research results (40) . In addition, the INC aims to inform clinical research by collecting the perspectives of parents who have experience with participation of their neonate in a research study (41) . Some HCPs were of the opinion that user-friendly information should be used to inform parents. Therefore, it is essential to involve parents, next to experts in human-computer interaction, when setting up an eIC system. For example, it is important that the information will not overwhelm already traumatized parents whose neonate is fragile. In addition, HCPs believed that the research site needs to foresee electronic devices which parents can use to review study information and electronically sign the IC. The use of digital technologies could result in the creation of digital vulnerable groups, also called the digital divide (42) . Therefore, it is crucial that the usability and the user-friendliness are adequately assessed and improved by involving parents in the design of eIC, considering their education level or health literacy (43) .",

            "text": "HCPs mentioned that antenatal counseling is of great value to support an informed decision. Golec et al. confirm that strengthening continuous communication with parents is important. It would be optimal to start the IC process early on and communicate until after the intervention (8) . Another study, researching parents' views of whom their child has taken part in longitudinal studies, found that parents would like to regularly receive information during the conduct of the study (44) . HCPs expect that an eIC system could facilitate ongoing communication with parents during or after the research study. An eIC system, enabling dynamic interactions over time, can update parents about the outcomes of the study or can invite them for a clinical consultation (27) . In addition, it is considered important that parents are continuously educated about the study details and their rights (8) . When long-term contact is established between parents and the research team via an eIC system, it could help to remind parents of their child's participation in a research study, which may be forgotten (45) . As formulated by the interviewed HCPs, it could be up to the parents to indicate how they would like to receive information. The eIC interface should give parents sufficient control to adapt it based on their needs, while being cautious to avoid burdensome practices (46) . HCPs indicated that the trusting relationship with parents is one of the main reasons to consent, which is in line with the available literature. For example, it was reported that information written in the IC form did not always support parents' understanding (47) . Similarly, HCPs raised that IC documents are often difficult to understand, due to scientific and legal information. HCPs have a legal and ethical duty to convey the necessary information to parents (9, 10). By using eIC, the same information needs to be provided to parents. However, this information can be provided by using various multimedia formats, as indicated by the interviewed HCPs. This finding was also observed in a systematic review. According to some research participants, multimedia could be more effective to convey research information in comparison to written text. Additionally, the use of simple, concise language and the implementation of a question and answer session were recommended to support parents' understanding (25) .",

For example, eIC decreases the risk of being exposed to the virus and the use of personal protective equipment that needs to be used when approaching COVID-19 infected parents in the course of the IC process (48) . The Central Committee on Research Involving Human Subjects, a competent authority in the Netherlands, issued a guidance on conducting clinical research during restrictive measures due to the COVID-19 pandemic (49, 50) . This guidance states that, if study medication is directly sent to research subjects' home, the subjects need to provide IC for the use of their personal information. IC can be provided orally and confirmed by mail (49) . The Belgian guidance, published by the Federal Agency for Medicines and Health Products, mentions that \"Any validated and secure electronic system already used in the investigation for obtaining informed consent can be used as per usual practice and if in compliance with national legislation\" which is in line with the guidance issued by the European Medicines Agency (51, 52) . Moreover, other countries issued guidance about the management of clinical trials during the COVID-19 pandemic. For example, Hungary explicitly states that the use of eIC is forbidden (53) . The FDA guidance, on the Conduct of Clinical Trials of Medical Products During the COVID-19 Public Health Emergency, refers to eIC as a valuable approach to obtain the IC of a hospitalized patient who is in isolation (54) .",

To minimize variability between interviews, an interview guide was used. The design of this interview guide was informed by the conduct of a systematic literature review. Additionally, the trustworthiness of the interview study was enhanced by two researchers who independently coded all interviews.",
