With the United States leading the path in terms of case incidence, it is important to investigate how weather variables influence the spread of the disease in the country. This paper assembles a detailed and comprehensive dataset comprising COVID-19 cases and climatological variables for all counties in the continental U.S. and uses a developed econometric approach to estimate the causal effect of certain weather factors on the growth rate of infection. The results indicate a nonlinear and significant negative relationship between the individual weather measures and the growth rate of COVID-19 in the U.S. Specifically, the paper finds that a 1 \u2022 C rise in daily temperature will reduce daily covid growth rate in the U.S. by approximately 6 percent in the following week, while a marginal increase in relative humidity reduces the same outcome by 1 percent over a similar period. In comparison, a 1 m/s increase in daily wind speed will bring about an 8 percent drop in daily growth rate of COVID-19 in the country. These results differ by location and are robust to several sensitivity checks, so large deviations are unexpected.",

Since its discovery in Wuhan, China, in December 2020 (WHO, 2020) , there have been more than 72.3 million cases, with 1.61 million deaths worldwide, according to John Hopkins University. 2,3 Of this count, the U.S. leads in both the number of cases (> 20%) and deaths (> 18%). Due to the novelty of the virus, there is a plethora of emerging research investigating its genesis and growth, both locally and globally. Mounting evidence attributes the slowed growth of covid infection to endogenous, non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) (e.g., Hsiang et al., 2020) , fear-driven behavioral change (e.g., Chernozhukov et al., 2021) , media influence (e.g., Bursztyn et al., 2020) , amongst others. On the other hand, few studies have detailed how some exogenous factors, such as weather changes, have influenced the number of covid cases, with no unanimity on whether and which environmental factors affect coronavirus transmission.",

Evidence from research on previous epidemics and contagious diseases reveals that weather affects infection rate of infectious diseases. Tan et al. (2005) ; Bi et al. (2007) document temperature rise as a strong factor that led to the decline in SARS infection. Importantly, the organism causing SARS (SARS-Cov) and covid (SARS-CoV-2) infect humans using similar receptor (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)) (Runkle et al., 2020) . Besides, a dyad of studies, Barreca and Shimshack (2012) ; Desch\u00eanes and Greenstone (2011) , use mortality and daily weather changes from U.S. counties to show that annual weather fluctuations, especially temperature and humidity, significantly influence mortality from infectious diseases such as influenza. Recent studies have linked the spike in Spanish flu deaths to declining temperature and torrential rainfall (More et al., 2020) . 4 Further, there is documentation that weather patterns affect the viability, activity, and transmission efficiency of viruses, 5 hence there is need for more extensive discussion on how and which environmental variables influence coronavirus activities. The few available studies are mostly outside the U.S. with mixed results.",

Further Chinese studies like Liu et al. (2020) ; Oliveiros et al. (2020) reach similar conclusions. On their part, Ma et al. (2020) find that a 1 unit rise in both temperature and absolute humidity will decrease China's covid death count in lag 3 and lag 5 periods, with the greatest decrease both in lag 3. Other country-based studies have also reported similar results. Using statistical methods, Rosario et al. (2020) evidence that the incidence of coronavirus in Brazil is negatively correlated with solar radiation (\u2212 0.609, p < 0.01), (maximum and average) temperature, and wind speed (p < 0.01). Two global studies - Sarkodie and Owusu (2020) ; Sobral et al. (2020) that investigate the impact of weather factors of covid find that temperature reduces covid case counts: however, they differ on the effect of rainfall. Sarkodie and Owusu (2020) find that rainfall increases covid caseload, whereas Sobral et al. (2020) observe no effect. On the contrary, a meta-review analysis by Bilal et al. (2020) fails to find a significant association between the pandemic and temperature.",

On the other hand, Runkle et al. (2020) employ a case-crossover design with a distributed lag nonlinear model to evaluate how humidity and temperature impact covid cases in 5 U.S. cities. They find that humidity outperforms temperature in reducing covid cases, although both have a non-linear relationship with cases. Using several statistical techniques, Bashir et al.

The weather data are gathered from more than 1000 weather stations all over the U.S., while the covid data is from the New York Times. In addition to the different weather measures employed and the covid index used, the sample's temporal length ensures that the study captures the weather variations in a typical year other than just occurrences in a limited part of the year as done in previous studies.

First, the method employed here does not account for changes in behavior following either the pandemic or weather variations, so what is examined here is \"short-term\" effect. It is expected that changes in human behavior due to climate change (Stankuniene et al., 2020) might alter how weather affects diseases as in Deschenes and Moretti (2009); Deschenes (2014) . 7 Hence, the estimated result should be seen as an upper-bound possibility. Also, the paper could not investigate the heterogeneous effect of weather on covid growth rate across age, race, and sex due to data unavailability. It is important to note that although the metrics used in this study are widely accepted in academic and policy circles (The Royal Society, 2020; Chernozhukov et al., 2021) , other metrics, such as reproduction rate, also contain important information about the progress of the pandemic. While no one metrics is better than the other, no (single) one provides sufficient information for policy purposes (UK Government, 2020). Hence both rates are always considered for a better understanding of the pandemic. Unfortunately, I am unable to calculate reproduction rate since it requires more sophisticated information, such as the period between each generation of infections, which is unavailable for most counties and some states. Regardless of the caveats, this work complements the growing literature seeking to understand the weather-covid nexus better.",

Weather affects the ability of pathogens to transit from person to person. Also, some or all of the cycle of infection -the population of pathogens and hosts, and the interactions between them (Avery et al., 2020) -could be affected by nature. Research has shown that high temperature reduces viruses' viability and activity; very cold temperature makes it difficult for them to replicate, thereby lowering the viral load in the atmosphere (Polgreen and Polgreen, 2018) . Besides, cold temperature increases sneezing and coughing, both of which are effective and fast mediums of transmitting contagious diseases. Further, cold air can irritate the airways and lungs, thereby causing breathing to be more strenuous and making the use of NPIs like face mask difficult to sustain 5 See, Campbell et al. (2013) in such conditions. Humidity is economically important as it affects human health via different mechanisms. Low humidity means less water content in the air, therefore making aerosols smaller. This condition can also lead to dehydration, promoting the spread of airborne diseases, like covid, due to prolonged activity of suspended infectious aerosols in the air. On the other hand, a moist atmosphere means that the aerosols are larger and fall to the ground much quicker. Further, some studies suggest that host resistance to viruses are low under dry air condition. For example, in a laboratory experiment, Kudo et al. (2019) observe that mice with influenza at 10% relative humidity level had more symptoms and are more likely to die than those at 50%. Equally important, high humidity causes sweating, making the cooling of the human body more difficult (Hsiang and Kopp, 2018) . Besides, it can impair the respiratory system because it abets the spread of non-viral organisms like bacteria, fungi, and dust mites (Barreca, 2012) .",

Agents can move between states via two ways: an infectious agent becomes noninfectious and moves to recovered state, or a susceptible agent can come in contact with an infectious agent, become infected, and move to the infected state. These movements are controlled by two parameters -recovery rate (\u03b3) and the number of people that would be infected by an infectious agent (R0).

The common expectation is that any disruption of infection activities due to weather actions will be realized after some time, ergo the main explanatory variables capture the weather events of seven days (or one week) preceding the week the outcome variable captures. As is customary in dynamic models (see, Dell et al., 2012) , this paper is interested in the cumulative effect of the lag structure, which represents the growth effect of weather fluctuations. Since weather variables are mostly correlated, the non-inclusion of an important weather variable can produce biased results, except if the relationship amongst the variables is uniform across counties, which is not so in this case, as seen in Fig. 1 . Hence, joint estimation of the weather variables accounts for the correlation among them. The paper does include precipitation as a customary practice but do not report the results because (i) there is little spatial variation in precipitation as seen in Figure S2 in the Supplementary Information, and ( ii) previous mortality-climate studies for the U.S. confirm that the impact of rainfall on health outcomes in the U.S. is insignificant due to reason (i) (Desch\u00eanes and Greenstone, 2011; Barreca, 2012) . I intend to use the variation inherent in these weather measures to capture accurate empirical estimates. In keeping with the convention in climate studies, this study includes the quadratic terms of the weather measures to capture potential non-linearities. Moreover, I do not add other controls to avoid the bad control scenario (Angrist and Pischke, 2008; Dell et al., 2014) . \u03b5 it are clustered at county-level to account for possible correlation of the standard error terms within county groups.",

The state regression results in Fig. 4 follow a comparable pattern as the previous sub-national regression results. The states with the highest impact of temperature are in the South and Northeast regions. Relative humidity shows some heterogeneity in terms of effects. States in humid regions benefit from an additional rise in relative humidity than those within low humid regions. Similarly, the impact of wind speed on GRI is higher for states with high wind speed, like Florida and Kentucky. On the contrary, low windy states such as New York and New Jersey may not benefit from a marginal increase in wind speed.",

While lockdowns, restrictions, and other NPIs are necessary to bend the curve, the enforcement of these measures should be tighter in areas with low temperature, humidity, or wind speed. These containment policies will help reduce the viral load in the atmosphere. Also, given that areas with low wind speed may experience infectious aerosols staying on surfaces for longer hours, sanitization of surfaces should be prioritized in these areas. As the race to get as much people vaccinated is on, the need to recognize priority people, periods, and places is important. Governments should not only focus on getting the jab into vulnerable people's or critical workers' arms but also target areas where the transmission tends to be more rapid due to prevailing weather conditions.",

Specifically, an additional increase in any of the weather measures considered will reduce GRI by a range of 1-8 percent. Also, these effects differ by location. Hot regions benefit more from temperature rise, while cold areas will benefit more from increased humidity and wind speed. The paper fails to accept the null hypothesis by early studies that weather changes do not affect covid outcomes. One reason these studies may have found insignificant estimates could be the use of (early) data with little within weather variation (see, Wooldridge, 2010) .",

The intuition follows from Kalkuhl and Wenz (2020) ; Dell et al. (2012) , who show that hot areas tend to be poorer than cold countries, and Adda (2016) , who observes that viral infections spread faster during an economic boom. Tying these two pieces together implies the existence of a linkage between weather, wealth, and pandemic. The results, therefore, suggest that warmer (and poorer) countries may experience less growth rate of infection. 15 The findings do not infer that nature can handle the pandemic more than human interventions. Since weather is exogenous, we cannot rely on its random occurrence to save humanity from the virus. Although weather fluctuations impact GRI, I believe that non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) are more effective in bending the curve (reducing the GRI) due to their endogenous nature. However, while safety measures are very important, the study suggests that they be taken more seriously in places with mild temperature, low humidity, and low wind speed. For example, since infectious aerosols are suspended longer in the atmosphere in low humid and windy areas, mask-wearing should be mandated in such areas to reduce the viral load going into the atmosphere. Besides, the predicted second spike during the winter period suggests that a fall in temperature and humidity could drive up infection rates.",
