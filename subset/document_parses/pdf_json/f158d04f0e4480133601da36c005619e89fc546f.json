However, several studies have reported that the sensitivity of initial RT-PCR tests were as low as 60-71%, which could be related to sampling errors, low virus load, or other factors (12, 13) . Furthermore, during the early stages of the outbreak, RT-PCR results must be confirmed by the Chinese CDC to make the final diagnosis in China (14) . Thus, prompt diagnosis and early isolation were rather difficult. Radiological examinations could play a vital role in the control of COVID-19 through prompt diagnosis, monitoring disease progression, and guiding clinical decisions (15) (16) (17) (18) . Portable chest radiography is used as a first-line triage tool in Italy and the United Korean J Radiol 2020;21 (7) kjronline.org Kingdom due to the reduced risk of cross infection and the ease of disinfection (19, 20) . However, several studies have reported that the sensitivity of chest radiography in detecting COVID-19 is as low as 56-69% (21, 22) . Chest computed tomography (CT) is fast and identify COVID-19 early with high sensitivity of 97-98% (12, 13, 23) . Thus, in the early stage of the outbreak, chest CT was considered as a major modality for detecting COVID-19 in China. Considering the importance of CT in fighting against COVID-19 from the perspective of Wuhan, the epicenter in China, dedicated CT scanners were employed in the fever clinics of nearly all hospitals (15, 24, 25) . Over the past two months, we have examined thousands of suspected cases of COVID-19 in the fever clinic and have successfully run with an infection rate of zero for our medical staff. As the COVID-19 epidemic is now widespread in the rest of the world outside China, an increasing number of radiologists are acting against the emerging infectious disease. Thus, we have timely summarized our experience in the management and infection control by the radiology department to help radiologists globally to minimize cross infection of COVID-19 among healthcare workers and patients. In addition, we have discussed the setup and workflow of our dedicated CT rooms for COVID-19 in our department.",

Enhanced management and infection control measures were enforced in each hospital to prevent nosocomial transmission of COVID-19. During the COVID-19 outbreak, an outdoor clinic in our hospital was set up outside the main outpatient building for the screening of incoming patients and any accompanying persons. All medical staff attended work through a designated passage. Everyone was required to wear masks with no breathing valve before entering the hospital. An infrared temperature detector was used to measure temperatures, which could be displayed on the computer screen instantly. A detailed questionnaire was also conducted by triage nurses (Fig. 1) . The definition of the epidemic area in our hospital often changed and followed the Diagnosis and Treatment Program of 2019 New Coronavirus Pneumonia released by the Chinese Health Commission. Given that the seasonal influenza was still widely spread in the community, referral of all fever patients to the COVID-19 fever clinic could increase potential patient-to-patient cross infection. Our hospital divided patients with fever or respiratory symptoms into two groups. Fever patients with an epidemiological history were asked to consult to the COVID-19 fever clinic, while those without an epidemiological history were treated using the routine workflow in the ordinary fever clinic (Fig. 2 ). All fever patients were required to undergo radiological examinations and routine blood tests to help diagnosis COVID-19. Considering that results of an initial RT-PCR may be false-negative, patients with typical radiological manifestations were categorized as suspected cases. If the diagnosis of suspected or confirmed cases were made, patients were immediately transferred to designated hospitals for further management.",

Each area was marked with red, yellow, and green notice plates at a prominent location (Table 2 ). Staff who worked in different areas were not allowed to visit each other without reason. This allowed our department to provide an uninterrupted radiology service in the event of any staff being infected. At the start of the outbreak, the shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE) was a big challenge to the hospital and PPE was strictly distributed based on the risk of the working area. Here, PPE is divided into four levels ( Table 3 ) (24) . The staff were required to use general protection in clean areas, level 1 protection in potentially dirty areas, and level 2 or level 3 protection in dirty areas (27) . Only radiographers who had frequent contact with fever patients used the highest level of PPE.",

This allows the segregation of patients with suspected COVID-19 from other patients, which can reduce the risk of cross infection and facilitate our routine radiology service. At the onset of kjronline.org the outbreak, a portable X-ray machine was designated to examine suspected COVID-19 patients in the fever clinic for several days. However, no positive findings were reported. Immediately after the recommendations from Chinese Healthy Commission and Hubei radiologists that chest thin slice CT could sensitively display the early-stage changes of COVID-19, such as subpleural patchy ground-glass opacity, one separate CT room in our radiotherapy department, near the fever clinic, was expropriated for patients with possible COVID-19. Meanwhile, a dedicated passage and waiting area were also established to minimize contact with other patients and health-care workers during transit. Barriers were placed to separate these areas, while precautions and directional signs were put up to guide patients and transporters to the examination room. For hospitals constrained by the amount or layout of equipment, we believe that the easiest way is to allocate dedicated time for suspected COVID-19 patients (28, 29, 31) . However, this may be rather challenging to implement as the clinical conditions of a patient often determine the examination time.",

The hospital infection control team provided kjronline.org us the infection control training. The training lectures, documents, and videos were provided by Wechat. Personal hygiene was reinforced, especially the hand hygiene procedure, and alcohol-based hand rubs were placed across the department. All radiology staff were required to be proficient in the proper steps of donning and doffing PPE. A regular audit of staff was carried out on careful hand hygiene, correct use of PPE, and strict adherence to isolation precautions. Only the staff with confirmatory tests could go back on duty. Furthermore, staff were encouraged to remind each other to follow the stringent infection control procedures in all clinical areas. In our department, diagnostic reports from dedicated facilities for COVID-19 test were requested within 30 minutes. Both radiographers and radiologists were familiarized with the typical and atypical imaging manifestations of COVID-19. A senior radiologist was assigned to collect the literature daily, summarize the imaging features of COVID-19, and provide training to other radiologists to improve their professional skills in diagnosing COVID-19 (15) . Considering that some asymptomatic patients with later confirmed COVID-19 may undergo examinations in undedicated machines, radiographers were also required to be familiar with atypical imaging features of COVID-19.
