Psychomotor performance occurs in real-time, hence a continuous assessment is necessary to provide action-oriented feedback and error avoidance guidance. We outline a deep learning application, the Intelligent Continuous Expertise Monitoring System (ICEMS), to assess surgical bimanual performance at 0.2-s intervals. A long-short term memory network was built using neurosurgeon and student performance in 156 virtually simulated tumor resection tasks. Algorithm predictive ability was tested separately on 144 procedures by scoring the performance of neurosurgical trainees who are at different training stages. The ICEMS successfully differentiated between neurosurgeons, senior trainees, junior trainees, and students. Trainee average performance score correlated with the year of training in neurosurgery. Furthermore, coaching and risk assessment for critical metrics were demonstrated. This work presents a comprehensive technical skill monitoring system with predictive validation throughout surgical residency training, with the ability to detect errors.",

The focus on \"adequate\" rather than \"excellent\" or \"expert\" patient care relates to challenges in outlining, assessing, quantifying, and teaching the composites of surgical expertise. To provide competency-based frameworks for complex psychomotor technical skills, advanced platforms need to be created which provide objective feedback during training along with error mitigation systems 7 . These frameworks need to be transparent and based on quantifiable objective metrics 8,9 . A technically challenging operative procedure in surgery involves the subpial resection of brain tumors adjacent to critical cortical structures 10 . Neurosurgical graduates are expected to be proficient in this complex bimanual skill which includes minimizing injury to adjacent normal tissues and hemorrhage from subpial vessels. Technical errors in this procedure can result in significant patient morbidity 10, 11 . Our group developed complex realistic virtual reality tumor resection tasks to aid learners in the mastery of this skill 12, 13 . Exploiting these simulations on the NeuroVR platform with haptic feedback (CAE Healthcare, Montreal, Canada) we quantified multiple components of the bimanual psychomotor skills used to expertly perform these tasks. Utilizing this data post-hoc, we developed expert performance benchmarks to which learner scores were compared and machine learning algorithms to classify participants into pre-defined expertise categories 8, 14, 15 . Limitations of these applications were the inability of ongoing assessment and error detection and improving performance during the task by providing continuous feedback.",

This platform was developed by a team of engineers from the National Research Council of Canada with expert inputs from 23 international training hospitals. Extended realism was provided by the 3D microscopic visualization through a binocular, and two haptic handles to allow bimanual simultaneous movement. Tumor physical properties were adjusted using data from multiple primary human brain tumor specimens 27 . Haptic tuning was applied based on the feedback from neurosurgeons 12 . Human brain tissue and bleeding mechanics were implemented including pulsation of blood vessels. A brain tumor surgery intraoperative audio recording was added to increase background auditory realism. The vast dataset generated by this platform allowed for the development of comprehensive intelligent systems 8,9 . Studies involving real-time surgical technical skills assessment demonstrated supportive results; however, these studies were restricted to one-handed virtual reality systems during a steerable needle task, epidural needle insertion or drilling a simulated femur [28] [29] [30] . Most operative procedures involve the coordinated interactions of both hands, each employing a different instrument to accomplish an operative goal. The major roles of expert operative room surgical instructors are to assess trainees' bimanual skills and help them improve their skills to safely carry out procedures to decrease patient morbidity and mortality 31 . This is crucial especially for high-risk medical procedures. Our group has focused on developing an LSTM network to mirror the role of surgical instructors in assessing bimanual performance involving high-risk complex neurosurgical procedures like the subpial resection. Previous real-time assessment applications utilized small datasets, included engineering students or nonidentified participants and have not validated or tested their algorithms on appropriate learner performance 16, [28] [29] [30] 32 . In contrast, the ICEMS was developed utilizing neurosurgeon/expert and medical student/novice performance, and its performance was tested using the data from neurosurgical trainees who are at different stages of training.",

Our results have shown that these expertspecific patterns were increasing throughout trainee-years in training. Expert surgeons develop and implement autonomous motor activity defined as 'psycho-motor skills script' with increasing surgical knowledge 15 . Our system allows trainees to have constant awareness of their level of performance as visualized on a lessskilled to expert scale. By self-modifying their bimanual psychomotor movements with the capacity for unlimited repetitions to achieve expert performance trainees may more quickly develop a \"psychomotor skills script\" associated with muscle memory that expert surgeons develop and maintain. This may allow trainees to be more prepared when faced with similar procedures in the operating room 15, 36, 37 .",

Intelligent systems can be developed in a similar way that the trainees learn, using information from limited number of experts but involving multiple occasions of a surgical procedure. This study involved data from 14 neurosurgeons (experts) each repeating the simulation tasks a total of six times, allowing an assessment of 83 expert trial data. If the number of experts is limited, the number of task repetitions performed by each surgeon can be increased to develop accurate and generalizable intelligent systems. This approach may provide a feasible and reproducible method in the intelligent assessment of different surgical skills. Should the data size be limited, data augmentation methodologies can help to increase data size and achieve reliable predictions 42 .

Our simulation does not reproduce many of the complex and dynamic learning interactions occurring in modern operating rooms and variables such as the view angle, surgeon instrument choice and instrument intensities were controlled. As simulation platforms advance and incorporate more detailed real-life interactions, more comprehensive assessments can be generated by the ICEMS. For training this supervised deep learning application, each data point of the performance of expert and novices was given the same score (expert: 1.00, novice: \u22121.00) throughout the task, allowing the algorithms to learn both extremes of the skill spectrum. However, individuals may not always perform in line with their expertise levels. In other words, skilled individuals may perform closer to less-skilled level in certain parts of the procedure and vice versa. Nevertheless, the magnitude of the data allowed algorithms to learn from the two end-skill levels and our system provided a granular differentiation across expertise levels as well as between trainee levels. We defined trainee expertise level based on operative exposure or year in training. However, trainee skill levels may not be completely consistent with these parameters and many other factors may also affect trainee technical skill, including trainee inherent ability or the type of exposure to operative skills 23 (Supplementary Table 3 ). By quantifying skills, our application addresses an important limitation for future studies to track trainee learning and explore trainee learning patterns 43 . Our study involved small number of participants from a single institution. With a broader cohort, the generalizability of our model can be increased.",

Each individual's performance data was always kept in the same subset. The performance metrics were normalized by z-score normalization, using the mean and standard deviation values based on the training set. Since the algorithm was designed as a 'regression' model where the output feature is predicted as a continuous variable, the categories of expertise levels were transformed into numbers where neurosurgeons (experts) and medical students (novices) were represented as '1' and '\u22121' respectively, at 0.2-s intervals. Assessment could be as frequent as 0.02 s (50 decisions a second) however we limited the decisions to 0.2 s (5 decisions per second) as more frequent decisions may overwhelm human perception. Considering the z-score normalization, '1' and '\u22121' represented one standard deviation above and below the mean performance, these values determined the two end of the performance (expert versus novice) of neurosurgical skill. This arrangement allowed not only detecting the two end levels of surgical performance but also the assessment of the performance spectrum in between.",

We utilized a supervised learning technique and designed our algorithm as a regression model. Our LSTM network was designed to minimize the computational burden ( Supplementary Fig. 1 ). The algorithm composed the first input sequence layer, two unidirectional LSTM layers, a fully connected layer, and a regression layer. Two dropout layers were used, after each LSTM layer, to help avoid overfitting. The number of nodes used for LSTM layers was calculated by adding one (1) to the number of input metrics (performance metrics). Sequence-to-sequence supervised learning was used. More complex designs can be developed, and the performance can be compared to our design. During the training, Adam (adaptive moment estimation) optimizer was utilized with a starting learning rate of 1e-3, decreased by x0.1 every 25 epochs. Minibatch size was 18, determined as the number of trials in the training set (108) divided by the number of repeats per person (6) . Shuffling was used at every epoch. The training was performed with 1000 epochs monitoring root-mean-squared-error values visually (Supplementary Table 1 ), using NVIDIA GeForce GTX 660 (6.0 Gbps).",
