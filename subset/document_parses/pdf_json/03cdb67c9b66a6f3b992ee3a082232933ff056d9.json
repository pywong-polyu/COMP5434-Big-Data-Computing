The aim of this study is to assess the clinical diagnostic values of serum amyloid A (SAA), procalcitonin (PCT), C-reactive protein (CRP), and interleukin (IL)-6 in children with bacterial, viral, or co-infections. Methods: A total of 181 children with infection symptoms (bacterial infection (Bac group), n = 46; viral infection (Vir group), n = 7; co-infections (Bac + Vir group), n = 128) were enrolled in our hospital from December 2019 to April 2020. Meanwhile, 42 healthy children without any infections were used as the controls. Venous blood samples were collected and the levels of serum SAA, PCT, CRP, and IL-6 were determined by immunoluminometric assay under an IMMAGE \u00ae analyzer. The diagnostic values of these biomarkers were assessed using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves.",

High level of PCT was observed in Bac and Bac + Vir goups. In addition, PCT (0.9281, 95% CI = 0.8645-0.9916) alone is an effective method for identifying bacterial infections. SAA in combination with CRP may distinguish co-infection from bacterial infection. Simultaneous positive of SAA, PCT, IL-6, and CRP can discriminate coinfection from the healthy controls. Conclusion: In a word, the levels of serum SAA, PCT, CRP, and IL-6 are increased to varying degrees in different infection situations. Our findings may provide early diagnosis for patients with different infections.",

[3] [4] [5] With the development of these inflammatory diseases caused by infections, some acute phase proteins are induced. 3, [6] [7] [8] For instance, procalcitonin (PCT) is a more specific and sensitive diagnosis marker for suspected bacterial infections relative to C-reactive protein (CRP). 6 PCT, CRP, and interleukin (IL)-6 can serve as diagnostic markers for septicopyemia patients induced by bacterial infections. 3 S PCT combined with CRP and IL-6 is used to identify bacterial and viral co-infection pneumonia. 7 In viral infection, the level of serum amyloid A (SAA) increases more than CRP level. 8 Because of the different concentrations (or sensitivities) of these proteins or cytokines in different infection situations, they are generally used to distinguish bacterial, viral, and co-infections in clinic. [8] [9] [10] Bozlu et al uncovered that the level of serum PCT in children with fever caused by bacterial infection continues to increase within 1 week and believed that PCT may help to differentiate bacterial and viral infections. 9 Generally, it is difficult to differentiate bacterial infection from viral infection in children with lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI); 11 however, Zhu et al reported that PCT combined with CRP and IL-6 improves the diagnostic accuracy of LRTI. 10 Perez reported that the prematurely elevated SAA is helpful to discriminate viral etiologies from bacterial etiologies. 8 In this study, to our knowledge, we for the first time explored the clinical diagnostic values of SAA, PCT, CRP, and IL-6 in children with bacterial, viral, or co-infections. These findings may develop an underlying method to improve diagnostic determination for the etiologies of the above three infections.",

Among them, 46 children were bacterial infection (Bac group), 7 cases were viral infection (Vir group), and 128 cases were co-infections (Bac + Vir group). In addition, 42 healthy children without any infections were used as the controls (HC group). Chest x-ray was taken on hospital admission in all children, and blood cultures were set up immediately. A throat, urine, cerebrospinal fluid, pleural fluid, joint fluid cultures were taken if necessary. All the children were divided into four groups as bacterial infection (Bac group), viral infection (Vir group), bacterial-viral coinfections (Bac + Vir group), and healthy controls (HC group). The patients in the Bac group (n = 46) were included according to the following criteria: 1) the signs suggesting bacterial lower respiratory tract infections in the chest radiograph (such as pleural effusion, consolidation, and lobar involvement) and 2) the presence of positive blood cultures and other culture positivity. The patients in the Vir group (n = 7) were included as follows: 1) normal chest x-ray or the presence of patterns suggestive of viral lower respiratory tract infections (interstitial infiltrate and peribronchial infiltrates) and 2) the absence of positive blood cultures and other culture negativity. Patients in the Bac + Vir group (n = 128) had the mixed infection symptoms. The healthy children (n = 42) were included as follows: 1) the absence of positive blood cultures and other culture negativity and 2) without any infection symptoms. The clinicopathologic characteristics of these children were in Table 1 .

The analysis results for Figure 1 were as follows: SAA: There were significant differences between Vir group and HC group ( Figure 1A , P < 0.01) as well as between Bac + Vir group and HC group (P < 0.001). In addition, compared to the Bac group, increased level of SAA was observed in both the Vir group (P < 0.01) and Bac + Vir group (P < 0.001). Interestingly, there seems to be no significant differences between the Bac and HC groups. PCT: Similarly, PCT level was also remarkably elevated in Bac + Vir group relative to the HC group ( Figure 1B ). Significant differences were also existed between Bac + Vir group and Bac group (P < 0.001) or Vir group (P < 0.001). Distinguished from SAA level, the level of PCT was significantly increased in the Bac group compared to that of the HC group (P < 0.001); however, no significant difference was found between the Vir group and HC group. IL-6: In comparison to the HC group, we found that IL-6 level was significantly elevated in the Bac ( Figure 1C , P < 0. 01), Vir (P < 0.001), and Bac + Vir groups (P < 0.001). Furthermore, the level of IL-6 was further increased in Bac + Vir group compared with the Bac group (P < 0.001).",

We speculated that compared to CRP, IL-6, and SAA, PCT is a better biomarker for distinguishing Bac from HC. In terms of the diagnostic values of these serum biochemical biomarkers in co-infection, SAA, PCT, IL-6, and CRP all had relatively large AUC area and high sensitivity/specificity. We believed that the combined use of SAA, PCT, IL-6, and CRP (simultaneous positive) is more likely to indicate co-infection. Afterwards, to distinguish co-infection from bacterial infection, we found that the AUC, sensitivity, and specificity of SAA and CRP were higher compared to those of PCT and IL-6, suggesting that combination analysis of SAA and CRP facilitate distinguishing between bacterial and coinfections.
