The German version of the Adverse Childhood Experiences Questionnaire, The General Habitual Well-Being Questionnaire and questions about own experiences of sexual harassment on the internet, experiences of domestic sexual abuse and different socio-economic variables were used. The outcome variables regarding the awareness of SA and SV in the media, different types of scandals (church, pedophile, USA), #MeToo-debate and the change in actions were used. Frequency analyses and binary regressions were conducted.",

German nationality and Muslim religion have a significant lower association. The variables that most commonly affected the awareness of SA and SV, scandals, debate and the individual actions were age, own experiences of sexual harassment on the internet and the Protestant religion.",

In a European study, the incidents of the perpetrators of non-partner sexual violence since the age of 15 shows that 23% of the perpetrators are not known to the victims before (4) . There has been an increase in the likelihood of victims and third parties reporting sexual abuse to authorities, with the perpetrator being publicly wellknown, or being a family member or friend. As a result of this, the number of reportings and sexual abuse cases covered in the media has risen a significant amount with most cases involving women and children (5) . A study conducted in the US involving college students (18) (19) (20) (21) (22) (23) (24) (25) (26) (27) (28) (29) shows that there are many factors that are associated with sexual abuse (SA) and sexual violence (SV), such as economic and ethnic factors that help maintain a culture of violence mostly against women (6) . Additionally, SA and SV and the effects during the Covid-19 pandemic can also be seen in newer developments (7, 8) . A different study suggests that the risk of intimate partner violence including SV is higher in individuals who come from and have lower educational and economic status (9) . This may also stem from past common behaviors where women and victims alike were often blamed for the sexual violence they experienced (10) . Although there are many factors (gender, ethnicity, and education) related to SA and SV, based on the results it would be important to know if these factors could also be a predictor of the awareness of SA and SV in the media. To our knowledge, there are no other studies that investigated (the predictors of) the awareness of SA and SV in the media.",

The study found that more women (1.2%) reported experiencing SV compared to men (0.6%), in the last 12 months of the study being conducted (13) . According to the analyses of the WHO, using data from over 80 countries showed that worldwide 35.6% of the women have experienced either physical and/ or sexual intimate partner violence or non-partner sexual violence (14) . Data collected in the USA shows that, 43.6% of women and 24.8% of men experienced some type of SV (15) . Generally, it is more likely for women to have one or more experiences with SA and SV (16) . Although this study speaks about SA and SV in the media, this specific type of media: geolocation-based dating websites and applications has not been covered but may also play a major role in SA and SV against women (17) . On the other hand, the younger generations are more encouraged to share their experiences which may be attributed to school prevention programs, and information sessions on sexuality (18) . As stated in the findings of the previous studies presented, women are more often victims of SA and SV, compared to men. Additionally, there are more studies that focus on women victims and less about SA and SV inflicted on men. The investigation surrounding are people aware of sexual abuse and sexual violence in the media? What are the predictors of awareness of sexual abuse and sexual violence? Have helped to sustain the focus of this study which includes both male and female participants.",

A recent representative and longitudinal German study found that younger women between the ages of 18-29 have a significant and increased prevalence of the disclosure of SA. The same study states that these women may have been triggered by their awareness of topics concerning SA and SV, especially via social media and the #MeToo-debate in 2016-2018 (20) . Therefore, media coverage of cases of SA and SV is important as 99% of the German population aged 14 and over are reached daily by media (21) . Also the use of technology is becoming more frequent with \u223c3 h a day, on average (22) . A study made up of a German population (N = 485) showed that the average use of social media specifically was 80.83 min (23) .

The #MeToo-debate is only one of the various movements made by other activists who encourage the use of hashtags and other forms of advocacy to express outrage and hurt about sexual harassment in Hollywood and in the business world (27) . In light of the #MeToo-debate, there have also been investigations on sexual harassment in the workplace, with many employees stating that sexual harassment is an issue in their workplace, also including those who have had a personal experience(s) of sexual harassment; along with the potential effects the #MeToo-debate may have on individuals and their roles in the future (28) (29) (30) . The #MeToo-debate is an example of how individuals with the same or similar experiences as others are more likely to talk about their own experiences of sexual abuse or sexual violence, but also in how bystanders might be inspired to step in. The \"bystander effect\" is the effect that in a crucial situation or a situation that would be considered an emergency, the likelihood of people helping decreases with the number of people present during or witnessing the event (31) . According to the results of a study conducted in 2011, those who knew someone who was being sexually assaulted was another point that was related to engaging in more positive bystander behaviors and attitudes (32) . The coverage of cases of sexual abuse and sexual violence in the media are important to continue the general conversation, to inform others and to make known that SA and SV is an ongoing issue. In this way, the awareness of SA and SV can only increase in both women and men, especially in situations when witnessing an act of SA or SV. This can create a culture of positive bystander behavior. Therefore, whether the awareness of sexual abuse and sexual violence in the media affects the actions of the individual was investigated in this study.",

To the best of the author's knowledge, there are no representative studies that investigate the awareness of sexual abuse and violence cases in the media. Due to this factor and because of the rise of public debates surrounding sexual abuse and sexual violence, the aim of the current study is to understand the following three main questions: Are people aware of sexual abuse and sexual violence in the media? What are the predictors of awareness of sexual abuse and sexual violence? Does the awareness of sexual abuse and sexual violence in the media affect the action of the individual? Additionally, the discussion on the subject is broad and may include adult sexual violence, and adult sexual violence inflicted onto children and adolescents. The three previous questions include scandals in the media and explore the attitudes and behavior of the population not directly involved. ",

The answer options in each question are dichotomous (yes or no). For the German version of the ACE-D questionnaire, a satisfactory reliability coefficient Cronbach's \u03b1 = 0.76 is shown. The item separation coefficients were in a low to medium range (0.30 and 0.65), which is related to the construction of the ACE-D questionnaire since each item captures a range of stressful experiences. Thus, there are items that are relatively independent of other items (Phi = 0.10-0.58), such as mental illness of a household member, separation from a parent, and also sexual abuse (41) . For the analysis, a sum score was made. Therefore, the answer \"no\" received the number 0 and the answer \"yes\" received the number 1. In general, it was possible to reach a sum score starting at 0-10.",

            "text": "Attention by the media and public awareness has helped to shed light on the ongoing issue of sexual abuse and victimization altogether (19) . The results of the current study show that the majority (62.6%) of the population is aware of SA and SV in the media which support the findings of the previous study mentioned. The discussion on SA and SV is rather broad and may include both adult sexual violence and sexual violence inflicted onto children and adolescents. In the last decades, the reporting of SA cases in the media have also risen (5) . Due to the rising number of cases of SA and SV, and in the media, this could help to bring more exposure to the overall topic.However, the percentage of the awareness of SA and SV in the media is only moderately high (62.6%). Reasons for the lack of awareness (37.4%) could be that awareness is influenced by one's own emotional state. Great components that make up individual awareness are cognitive schemata, expectations, desires, prior knowledge, and needs. The more pronounced these aspects are for the respective issue, the less inconsistent information are awarded (38) . This indicates that those who have experienced SA and SV are more likely to be aware of the topic in the media. Likewise, the results show that people who have experienced sexual harassment on the internet (OR = 1.601) and individuals that had an experience(s) with SA in childhood (OR = 1.183) had a significantly higher degree of the awareness of SA and SV in the media. It may be useful for those aware of sexual abuse and sexual violence, along with media cases involving SA and SV to link or inform others on where to find help or support. Although not every individual has had an experience of SA and SV, the information may be useful for them to hold on to or pass on depending if they ever encounter an experience with SA or SV, or if they know of someone who has had an experience. More specifically, it is more likely for women to have one or more experiences with SA and SV compared to men (15, 16) . This relates to our results that show a significantly higher degree of awareness of SA and SV in the media in females compared to males (OR = 1.409) which could be attributed to their personal experiences with SA and SV and could be a reason for why female gender is a predictor. Additionally, a German study showed that younger women between the ages of 18-29 have a significant and increased prevalence of the disclosure of SA. These women may have been triggered by their awareness of topics concerning SA and SV, especially via social media and the #MeToo-debate (20) . In this study, gender has no significant association to the awareness of the #MeToo-debate as well as to the awareness of all other sexual cases (USA, Pedophile, Church) included. In order to reach a higher percentage of the male population both in Germany and in other countries, media attention and exposure should cover sexual abuse and sexual violence cases inflicted on males, as much as it does females. Perhaps this will initiate a greater conversation within the male population and bring more awareness to the fact that sexual abuse and sexual violence can happen to anyone, regardless of their gender.",

Further discussing age, the study additionally found that aging (getting older) is associated with a higher degree of the awareness of SA and SV, Pedophile cases and Church cases in the media (OR = 1.009; 1.009; 1.018). The different age association concerning the awareness of the #MeToo-debate could be explained by the fact that the #MeToodebate is an online movement that has primarily circulated on social media (25) . Social media is used more frequently by and has the greatest impact on the younger generation (24) . Additionally, the use of media, specifically the internet increases within the ages of 14-29 (21) . The results show that sexual harassment on the internet is significantly associated with a higher degree of being aware of the #MeToo-debate in the media (OR = 2.492). The awareness of the #MeToo-debate and the exposure of sexual harassment on the internet may be attributed to high internet usage. In order for the younger generation to be more knowledgeable on the topic of SA and SV, ageappropriate information could be given at schools with parental consent, or information could be given to children through parents themselves. This may assist children's awareness and help them to gain more insight on how to act if they were to encounter experiences with SA or SV.",

            "text": "Furthermore, another interesting result from this study concerning the religion is that religion is no significant predictor for the awareness of the Church cases in the media. This may be due to the grouping of the variable. The church cases were made up of cases in four different countries (U.S., Ireland, Australia, and Germany). It must be considered that these cases contained adult sexual violence and sexual violence and abuse inflicted onto children and adolescents, and cannot be categorized under a certain age group. Considering this sample is mostly made up of a German population belonging to different religions, their awareness of the church cases in other countries may be lower than their awareness of SA and SV in church cases within Germany. This could be a reason for why religion is not a significant predictor. Another reason for this unexpected outcome could be that the questionnaire did not assess the intensity of their belief, or the degree to which these individuals practice religion if belonging to one. A study's findings suggest that regular Catholic Church attendance is greatly declining and the number of Catholics who do not or rarely attend church/religious services is greatly increasing (42) . Therefore, it is unknown if participants who specified their religion, practice or frequently attend religious services.",

Therefore, being inspired to share own experiences and having a greater awareness of SA and SV in the media may be attributed to the realization and understanding of sexual abuse and sexual violence that comes with age and information on the topic. Additionally, there have been newer developments that investigate SA and SV during the Covid-19 pandemic, which may also help to shed light on the topic (7, 8) . The conversation surrounding SA and SV has picked up and has become less taboo (11) which may help victims to become more informed, as more information and proper definitions of SA and SV are circulated.",

In this study, close to 47% answered being moderate or strongly inspired to pay more attention to SV against children in their environment. The amount of people paying attention to SA and SV in their surroundings could be increased through bystander interventions. A systematic review on bystander training programs for the prevention of SV was conducted in 2017, and the findings state that trainings can be helpful to positively change behaviors and attitudes (45) . Bystander interventions could also be helpful to train people to react appropriately in crucial situations, especially involving SA and SV. Help centers for victims could also consider promoting any local bystander programs available that can be offered at any time. Furthermore, the coverage of cases in the media might increase the chances of bystanders stepping in when witnessing SA and SV, which may be due to their heightened awareness on the topic (media coverage) and the severity of the act. Other possible reasons for an increase in bystanders stepping in may be due to social approval and moral motivation (46) .",

Components of individual awareness are also knowledge (38) . This could be attributed to the fact that people who have experienced negative things in their childhood, and who have experienced some kind of SA or SV are inspired to pay more attention compared to people who have had no contact or experiences. This relates to why media coverage on SA and SV is important. Not only can it help other victims speak about sexual abuse, but as the results suggest, it can also inspire them to be more aware of children experiencing SA or SV around them. Learning how to react to people who share their own experiences, along with some bystander education may help cultivate a judgement-free environment for those wanting to share their experiences with SA and SV. It must be considered that not every individual is appropriately informed on topics surrounding SA and SV, therefore the risk of victim-blaming and judgment may stem from past common behaviors, where women and victims alike were often blamed for the rape or abuse they experienced (10) . Additionally, the amount of support victims get may vary in different countries.",

The necessary criterion for labeling a relationship as causal lies in the time difference between cause and effect (49) .

In general, this study does not collect data on the type of media and the participants' consumption behavior (e.g., hours per day). This means that the media does not differentiate between print, radio, TV or social media. Various studies show that younger people in particular are consuming more and more social media and media in general online (21, 24, 50) . Social media in particular could be a danger in this respect, as filter bubbles often mean that they only reflect one's own interests (51) . It is important to note that social media platforms and their algorithms are set up to show users more content based on what the user likes, shares, comments or clicks on. Therefore, it would be an invalid representation of sexual abuse in this type of media. In addition, regardless of this limitation, the study through its large randomized sample size, represents the German awareness of SA and SV in the media. Additionally, there were no further investigations on what SA and SV means to the study population. This could also explain why the awareness of SA and SV was \u223c50%.",
