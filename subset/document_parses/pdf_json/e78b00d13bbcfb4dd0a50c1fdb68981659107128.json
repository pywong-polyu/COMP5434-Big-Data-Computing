            "text": "Research shows that bullying is a significant workplace issue. A previous study showed increased sickness-related absences among municipality employees during the Icelandic economic crisis in 2008. This led to the following research questions: has bullying and/or harassment increased between the time points of the study up to seven years after the crisis? Did bullying and/or harassment change depending on downsizing? Are quantitative job demands, role conflicts and social support connected to bullying and/or harassment at work and if so, how? The study is based on a four-wave longitudinal balanced panel dataset consisting of those who work within the education and care services operated by Icelandic municipalities. It was seen that bullying and harassment had increased between the time points of the study. Furthermore, employees in downsized workplaces, workplaces with higher quantitative job demands, more role conflicts and less support were more likely to experience bullying and/or harassment than employees in other workplaces. Since the effects may prevail for several years, the study demonstrates that the consequences of downsizing need to be carefully considered and that managers must be supported in that role. As economic crises tend to occur periodically, presently due to COVID-19, the knowledge is both of theoretical and practical importance. of absenteeism, turnover and productivity as well as team and group performance. Nevertheless, in one of the first studies of workplace bullying, Einarsen, Raknes and Matthiesen [7] focused on psychosocial factors at work as predictors of bullying. Since then, several studies have demonstrated the importance of organizational factors in preventing bullying and other unwanted harassment at work. They revealed that work-related factors such as heavy workload, lack of job security [8-10], high job demands, low job control [11, 12] , role conflict [7, 13, 14] , lack of support from superiors and co-workers [11, 15] , organizational changes [8, 15, 16] , and downsizing [17] can lead to an environment prone to bullying and harassment. According to a recent systematic review by Brande, Baillien, Witte, Elst and Godderis [18] , the most relevant work-related factors predicting workplace bullying are role conflict, workload, role ambiguity, job insecurity, and cognitive demands. Furthermore, the higher pace of change, increasing work intensity, and uncertainties about future employment may influence the level of stress, which provide fertile grounds for workplace violence, particularly bullying and harassment [19] . This hostile work environment can affect the health and well-being of the individual, increasing tension among co-workers and managers, reducing productivity, and lead to a rise in sickness-related absence and turnover rates [7] .",

            "text": "According to Eurofound [19], employees in the public sector are more likely to have experienced bullying and harassment at work than those in the private sector, most probably due to comparatively higher levels of contact with the public. In line with that, the fifth European Working Conditions Survey showed that sectors with higher levels of contact with external clients, customers, patients, or students are prone to an increased risk of exposure to bullying and harassment [20] . Thus, it should not be of surprise that municipal employees are at a high risk of experiencing bullying and harassment at work [19, [21] [22] [23] [24] . According to Zapf's [24] study, employees in the education sector, which often belongs to municipalities, were three times more likely to be bullied than employees in other sectors. In this light, and as the world is facing a deep economic crisis due to COVID-19, a longitudinal study as presented here, conducted in the wake of the economic crisis in 2008, among municipal employees within the education and care services is important, but rare. The study aims to improve the understanding of the development of lack of well-being, reflected in bullying and harassment during turbulent times, and increase the possibilities of proper actions being taken in such times, as requested by Hutchingson [2]. It is a four-wave panel study, asking whether bullying and/or harassment among those who work within education and care services, operated by Icelandic municipalities, changed during the economic downturn that began in 2008. Employing the job demand-control (JDC) model, which has rarely been used to analyze jobs in the educational sector, the relationship between factors such as downsizing, job security, job demands, and role conflict was analyzed, as a possible predictor of bullying at work during and after the economic crisis in Iceland.",

Regardless of the cause, the consequences of bullying can be severe, including physical and psychological symptoms and negative work-related outcomes [1] . Two common explanations for workplace bullying relate either to the personality of the bullied individual or to the aspects of the work environment. Hutchinson [2] argued that theorizations and policy definitions often emphasize the individual aspects of bullying and overlook the significance of organizational, employment and cultural factors. He also argued that the capacity of policies to prevent or resolve the problem is limited. Hoel, Cooper and Einarsen [3] also highlighted that the economic cost of bullying has received little attention which is somewhat surprising given the magnitude of the problem [4] , and the effect of bullying on the individuals targeted [5, 6] . This would undoubtedly represent a substantial cost to the organization, whether through payouts to settle claims of bullying and harassment or affecting levels",

According to Eurofound [19] , approximately 6% of European employees reported having experienced some form of workplace violence, either physical or psychological, in the past 12 months. Levels of reported psychological violence (bullying or general harassment) are higher than physical violence, but bullying or harassment (12%) is more prevalent than sexual harassment (1%). Icelandic studies show that between 4% and 20% of employees have experienced bullying at work [30, 31] . A recent study conducted by Snorrad\u00f3ttir et al. [31] revealed that 20% of employees had experienced bullying at work, 16% sexual harassment and 10% gender-based harassment. These numbers show the magnitude of the problem that bullying and harassment pose and the importance of creating a good healthy working environment for employees.",

Most workplace bullying studies use a 12-month timeframe, since bullying usually involves repeated long-lasting conflicts. Einarsen and Skogstad [32] reported that the average exposure to bullying was 18 months, but in a study by Hoel and Cooper [33] , 39% of the bullied employees reported that the bullying had lasted for more than two years. Vartia's [34] study among Finnish municipal employees showed that 29% of the bullied employees had been bullied for two to five years and 30% had been exposed to it for more than five years. Keashly and Neuman [35] reported that more than a third of the bullied employees in a study of university faculty and staff had been bullied for more than three years. Therefore, a longitudinal panel study, as presented here, is essential. What our data adds to this knowledge is the time dimension, as it measures how changes in bullying and harassment occurred two, three, five, and seven years after the economic collapse in Iceland. Thus, we show changes in bullying and harassment among municipal employees working within the educational and care professions.",

Hoel and Cooper [33] and Hoel, Cooper, and Faragher [36] claimed that men and women are equally likely to be bullied. However, Zapf et al. [37] showed that 62.5% of victims of bullying were women, based on analyses of 53 studies on bullying. On the other hand, Eriksen and Einarsen [38] and Martino, Hoel, and Cooper [39] showed that gender minority is a risk factor. Thus, men are more likely to be bullied than women if the majority of employees are women, and vice versa. Furthermore, Vartia and Hyyti [40] found no gender difference in the number of employees being bullied among those who worked in a traditionally male-dominated environment, such as prisons. However, female prison workers have been subjects of sexual harassment significantly more often than their male colleagues [19] . Some studies have suggested that bullying and harassment in the workplace correlate with age, where younger employees are at a relatively greater risk of being bullied and experiencing more unwanted negative behaviors such as gender-based and sexual harassment than older employees (see, e.g., [19, 39] ). On the contrary, other studies have shown no such correlations [37] .",

Baillien and Witte [8] further showed a significant connection between organizational change and bullying, where role conflict, job insecurity and workload increased bullying, but social support from colleagues was shown to be related to bullying as a protective factor. Despite these studies, a deeper knowledge is needed about the connection between an economic crisis, which comes frequently, and often unexpectedly, and workplace bullying and harassment over a long time.

However, in the wake of the economic collapse, many municipalities reacted with cutbacks in services, but for many of them, that was not enough. As labor cost constitutes the largest single expenditure (around 60% of the total revenue), municipalities were forced to reduce their wage cost by reducing overtime, instituting hiring freezes, offering voluntary retirement, restructuring jobs, and laying off employees [55] . Municipality mayors have begun to step up in the media, pointing out similar issues related to today's pandemic [56] .",

            "text": "It was seen that in the wake of the economic collapse in 2008, employees' health and well-being within education and care services in Iceland, operated by the municipalities, became worse [57] . The same applied for the banking sector five months after the collapse [50, 58] . Based on that, we ask whether bullying and harassment have increased within the municipal education and care services, not only in the immediate aftermath of the collapse, but also whether the rate has returned to pre-collapse levels. More precisely, based on Kulkarni [46] , we anticipated that job demands have increased in the wake of the economic collapse, and expect that this will lead to less role conflict and increased exposure to bullying and harassment at work. Hence, the research questions are as follows: (a) Has bullying and/or harassment increased between the time points of the study up to seven years after the crisis? (b) Did bullying and/or harassment change depending on downsizing? (c) Are quantitative job demands, role conflict and social support connected to bullying and/or harassment at work and, if so, how? By answering these questions and testing the hypotheses that (1) downsizing and; (2) increased job demands and role conflict lead to more bullying, but (3) the effects of these variables are mitigated through support by supervisors and coworkers, the aim is to further develop an understanding of the connection between these variables two, three, five, and seven years after the economic collapse. This knowledge is important when aiming to limit the negative effects on employees during downsizing during an economic crisis.",

In order to monitor possible changes for each individual, the focus was on all employees in education (kindergarten teachers and primary school teachers) and care services (elderly care and care for people with disabilities), who responded to the survey at all four time points of the study. In 2010, the number of employees in the education and care services was 5717, and 4542 of them responded to the questionnaire (79%). Of the 4,542 baseline respondents, 4415 were still working 16 months later, at the time of follow-up study 1, and 3359 (76%) responded to the questionnaire a second time. Of the 3359 follow-up study 1 respondents, 3258 were still working 20 months later, during follow-up study 2. Of these, 2356 responded to the questionnaire a third time for follow-up study 2 (72%).

Of these, 1890 responded to the questionnaire a fourth time for follow-up study 3 (84% response rate or 33% of the original group of employees). Thus, the response rate through the years was between 72% and 84%, which is good. In this light, the data are strong, especially as this is not a sample but that all employees received the survey.",

A repeated-measures ANOVA was conducted to explore whether changes in the reported bullying and/or harassment were different between downsized workplaces and ones without, depending on quantitative job demands, role conflict, and support from superiors and co-workers. Generalized estimating equations (GEEs) were used to evaluate the impact of downsizing, quantitative job demands, role conflict, job security, support from superiors and support from co-workers on bullying and/or harassment over time, and at specific time points. The GEE method has several advantages for analyzing longitudinal data; for example, it uses all available data points, provides a method for handling the correlated nature of repeated measurements, and accounts for the pattern of change over time [60] . A binomial distribution with logit link function was used to evaluate the dichotomous dependent variable (bullying and/or harassment). We selected a first-order exchangeable correlation structure. In model 1, the main effects of downsizing, study time point, quantitative job demands, and role conflict were examined. In model 2, support from superiors and co-workers was added to model 1. To test our hypotheses that the effects of downsizing depend on both role conflict and support from superiors and co-workers, the interaction between downsizing and quantitative job demands, interaction between downsizing and role conflict, and interaction between downsizing, role conflict, and support from superiors and co-workers were added to model 3. We obtained the odds ratio (OR) and associated the p value for each predictor in the GEE models. SPSS 21.0 was used to conduct all data analyses.",

Employees in workplaces with downsizing were more likely to report experience of bullying and/or harassment at all time points of the study. The differences were highest in 2013 when 9% more employees reported being exposed to bullying and/or harassed in workplaces with downsizing than those without. These results show the importance of downsizing as a factor in working environment influencing bullying, and harassment as Landsbury et al. [17] pointed out in their research. It is important to emphasize that this relationship is evident, even if employees in our study do not experience job insecurity as in the case with most of the studies cited.",

The results further show that employees in workplaces with higher quantitative job demands and more role conflict were more likely to experience bullying and/or harassment than employees in workplaces where quantitative job demands remained low over time. Importantly the influence of downsizing and role conflict on bullying and/or harassment were buffered by support from superiors and co-workers. These results are in line with Baillien and Witte's [8] study, which stated that role conflict and workload increased the likelihood of bullying, but social support was a protective factor. This tells us that managers and those who are responsible for well-being at work should always emphasize social support, not the least in turbulent times, and in workplaces where the psychosocial environment is strenuous.",

As Eriksen and Einarsen [38] and Martion, Hoel and Cooper [39] showed that gender minority is a risk factor, this research should possibly have shown that men were at greater risk. However, this study showed no significant gender differences. Both women and men and employees in all age groups experienced increased job demands, more role conflict, and downsizing over the studied period. But being married or cohabiting was a protective factor in all time points of the study. It cannot be explained, based on this data, why this is a protective factor, but this is probably because being able to share a life with another person makes it easier for individuals to think of something else other than work while at home. It is a concern that the situation deteriorated by all measures up to the year 2013-that is five years after the economic crisis started, and it is interesting to see that the situation improved somewhat in 2015. This indicates that the situation has started to improve again. Nevertheless, in cases, the situation was worse in 2015 than in the first wave in 2010. In this light, what happens in 2020 due to COVID-19 is a matter of worry as, clearly, the financial situation of the municipalities has worsened sharply, due to the pandemic.",

As various workplaces are governed by economic factors rather than those related to people's well-being, we hope that future research will evaluate this. Secondly, even though it is important to divide the workplaces into two categories, based on whether they had been downsized, it is not possible to classify them according to the magnitude of downsizing, as we did not have such data. Thirdly, it can be seen as a weakness to use only one question to measure bullying and two questions to measure harassment. In this context, however, we argue that we are not analyzing the nature of bullying or harassment in the workplaces under scrutiny, but rather whether the employees have/had been exposed to this behavior in general, and how it relates to the time factor and the organizational issues under examination. Fourth, even though we have longitudinal data, we cannot distinguish between the effects of organizational factors and possible spreading of effects, good or bad, from outside the workplace. Although we found convincing connections between increased job demands, role conflict, lack of social support, and bullying and harassment, at all time points of the study, it is difficult to establish with certainty the extent to which this can be traced directly to what happens within the workplace, or whether the situation outside the workplace has an influence as well.",

In contrast to the extraordinary mass layoffs among employees in the banking and construction sectors [58] , the downsizing of the workforce in municipalities was primarily carried out by a reduction in overtime and substitute workers, implementation of a hiring freeze, offering voluntary retirement, and restructuring jobs. The \"silent\" downsizing of the workforce combined with people's notion that job security in the public sector surpassed that of private industry, resulted in little discussion, understanding, or even sympathy among the public at large, for the situation of municipal employees. Despite the cutbacks in their operations, municipalities were, however, still legally obligated to provide welfare services for all residents, including education. Hence, the combination of a reduction of the workforce, having fewer resources available to perform standard operations, while simultaneously being obliged to maintain the same level of services as before, led to a considerably increased strain on municipal employees. Nevertheless, we do not know for sure if the increase in bullying and harassment only had to do with poorer work conditions, or to what extent it also had to do with deteriorating personal circumstances outside the workplace, and/or increased awareness of the problem. Despite this, we view the results as presenting a good understanding of changes in bullying two to seven years after the economic collapse.",

It adds important elements to existing knowledge, as it is socially and politically vital to understand how negative consequences of the economic crisis in 2008 manifested in changes in bullying and harassment for up to seven years after the crisis. Since the effects may prevail for several years, the study demonstrates the importance of preserving the work organization and workplace behavior of all employees. As social support, particularly managerial support, proved to be a buffer against other assessed factors in our study, it is important to find ways to strengthen managers in this role. As economic crises tend to occur periodically, and a deep crisis is imminent due to COVID-19, organizations should be aware of this and take active measures to ensure that the workplace is a safe and secure place for every employee. This knowledge is also of importance for those who work with policies for the reduction of bullying and harassment in their services. Even though our study is on employees working within education and care services operated by Icelandic municipalities, we believe that the main results touch upon fundamental elements, such as well-being at work, and can be applied to other and different workplaces as well.

Role conflict increased slightly between the first three time points 2010 and 2013. but remained the same for 2013 and 2015 [F (2, 2342) = 44.0, p \u2264 0.05]. In workplaces were employees did not report layoffs, they experienced less role conflict than where participants reported layoffs [2010: t (1886) = 5.28, p \u2264 0.05; 2011: t (1885) = 4.72, p \u2264 0.05; 2013: t (1883) = 6.20, p \u2264 0.05. 2015; t (1888) = 4.67, p \u2264 0.05]. The scale mean in workplaces where employees did not report layoffs was 4.1 (Sd = 0.8) in 2010, 4.1 (Sd = 0.7) in 2011, 4.1 (Sd = 0.9) in 2013, and 4.0 (Sd = 0.9) in 2015. However, it was 3.9 (Sd = 0.9) in 2010 in workplaces where employees reported layoffs, 3.9 (Sd = 0.9) in 2011, 3.8 (Sd = 0.9) in 2013, and 3.8 (Sd = 0.9) in 2015.",
