            "text": "The occurrence of concentration and temperature gradients in saline microdroplets evaporating directly in air makes them unsuitable for nucleation studies where homogeneous composition is required. This can be addressed by immersing the droplet in oil under regulated humidity and reducing the volume to the picoliter range. However, the evaporation dynamics of such a system is not well understood. In this work, we present evaporation models applicable for arrays of sessile microdroplets with dissolved solute submerged in a thin layer of oil. Our model accounts for the variable diffusion distance due to the presence of the oil film separating the droplet and air, the diffusive interaction of neighboring droplets, as well as the variation of the solution density and water activity due to the evolving solute concentration. Our model shows excellent agreement with experimental data for both pure water and NaCl solution. With this model, we demonstrate that assuming a constant evaporation rate and neglecting the diffusive interactions can lead to severe inaccuracies in the measurement of droplet concentration particularly during nucleation experiments. Given the significance of droplet evaporation in a wide array of scientific and industrial applications, the models and insights presented herein would be of great value to many fields of interest.",

However, this seemingly \"simple\" process is governed by the complex interplay of many physical phenomena such as evaporative mass transfer 9 , heat conduction and convection, thermal-hydrodynamic instabilities, viscous and inertial flows, surface-tension-driven flows, contact-line pinning and depinning, buoyancy effects, and other effects. 10 Given its complexity and practical significance, numerous experimental and theoretical investigations have been devoted to better understand the underlying physics of sessile droplet evaporation 10 . Many of these studies dealt with the evaporation of either pure liquid droplets [11] [12] or those with suspended colloidal particles which can lead to the so-called \"coffee-ring effect\" [13] [14] . However, the evaporation of droplets containing dissolved salts has been rarely investigated. For instance, Takistov et al. 15 , Shin et. al. 16 , Zhang et. al. 17 , and Zhong et. al. 18 showed that the resulting patterns and morphologies of the dried salt droplets depend on the wettability of the surface, i.e. crystal rings would form on hydrophilic surfaces while single crystals at the center of the droplet are likely to form on hydrophobic surfaces. This suggests that surrounding salt droplets with hydrophobic liquid is a promising approach for studying nucleation inside the droplet without interaction with the hydrophobic liquid, i.e. homogeneous primary nucleation.",

            "text": "In the context of crystallization studies, we need to ensure spatial homogeneity of droplet temperature and composition. However, in microliter droplets, it has been shown that various internal and Marangoni flows can lead to temperature and concentration gradients [19] [20] . To address this, we reduce the droplet size down to picoliter range 21 and we reduce the evaporation rate by immersing the droplet in oil under regulated humidity. 22 The oil bath also serves as a thermal buffer which minimizes temperature gradients due to evaporation. To extract nucleation parameters from such experiments 23 , it is crucial to determine how the volume, and so supersaturation of microdroplets, evolve with time. In modeling the evaporation rate, Souli\u00e9 et. al. 24 reported that the droplet volume varies linearly with time within the early stages of evaporation. Given that the later stages of evaporation are crucial for the analysis of nucleation, we need a model that works even for the later stages. Since we are dealing with arrays of concentrated salt microdroplets immersed in a film of oil, there are additional phenomena that need to be accounted for. First, the variable diffusion distance due to the presence of oil film separating the microdroplet and air must be taken as an additional parameter. Second, the diffusive interactions due to the presence of neighboring microdroplets must be accounted for. 25 Third, the density of the microdroplet changes as water evaporates. Fourth, the equilibrium concentration at the interface varies with time because water activity decreases as solute concentration increases (Raoult's law). 26 In this work, we derive expressions describing the evaporation dynamics that account for these four additional phenomena based on wellestablished mass transfer equations. We then validate our model with experimental data 27 . Moreover, we highlight that (1) surprisingly, different contact-line behavior such as constant contact angle (CCA), constant contact radius (CCR), and stick-slide (SS) leads to comparable evolution of microdroplet volume within the time of nucleation (2) failure to account for diffusive interactions between microdroplets nor the changes in colligative properties can lead to significant overestimation of their concentration.",

In the extreme case where the droplet remains pinned throughout its lifetime, we refer to this as the constant contact radius (CCR) mode. In this mode, the volume decreases due to the continuous decrease in contact angle. As experimental studies suggest, 11 real microdroplets evaporate in some mixture of CCR and CCA modes. One common observation is the occurrence of CCR mode at the beginning and once the contact angle decreases to a value less than the receding contact angle \u03b8r, it switches to CCA mode.

With simple trigonometry, the contact radius and droplet height allow calculation of contact angle and droplet volume, assuming that microdroplets are spherical caps (see section 1 of SI, Figure A) .

Meanwhile, Figure 2b shows that the contact angle \u03b8 decreases until this threshold at tp. This behavior indicates that the system undergoes a stick-slide (SS) mode, i.e. CCR followed by CCA. In our system, we found that the time of pinning tp corresponds to a contact angle of around 86\u00b0 (Figure 2b) . Thus we assume a receding contact angle of \u03b8r=86\u00b0 for our system and we use this value for the stick-slide (SS) model in equation (15) . Upon comparing the experimental points with the model predictions, it is clear that the stick-slide (SS) model well captures the evolution of the microdroplet geometric parameters (i.e. contact angle, contact radius, height, and volume). Note that although the observed deviations in contact angle and droplet height (Figure 2b,c) could be due to instrumental limitations, the SS model in itself is an idealization. In reality, the radius and contact angle can evolve simultaneously which is more difficult to model. Interestingly, regardless of the contact-line behavior (CCR, CCA, SS), the droplet volume evolves almost identically (Figure 2d) . This is in agreement with Stauber et. al. 12 who showed that on strongly hydrophobic surfaces, the volume evolution of the two extreme modes CCA and CCR tend to converge for contact angles To visualize the evolution of droplet shape, we used the numerical solution in Figure 2 to simulate the geometry of the droplet at discrete time points.

However, in the context of crystallization studies, the most important parameter to obtain from the evaporation modeling is the evolution of droplet volume on which the solution concentration depends. Thus, regardless of the droplet shape, the excellent agreement of the CCR, CCA, and SS in terms of droplet volume indicates that we can just choose one of these three contact-line behavior models to calculate the droplet concentration. In the case of saline droplets, we currently do not have an experimental value of the receding angle \u03b8r needed in SS model. Consequently, we use CCA to describe the evaporation rate as this is the simplest case mathematically.",

As mentioned, this is based on bottom-view images from an inverted optical microscope which allow us to measure experimental points corresponding to the time at which the solution is saturated (S=1) and the time at which the refractive index of the droplet matches that of the oil (S=1.395) details are shown in reference 22 and Table S3 , section 6 of SI. In Figure 4 , we see that the CCA model is able to predict the two experimental points with excellent accuracy. Recall that in our CCA model derivation, we incorporated four important modifications to the well-established mass transfer equations. Thus, it would be interesting to see how each model modification affect the model predictions. In Figure 4 , we see that neglecting the oil height correction can slightly overestimate the predicted volume. This is because without the oil height parameter, the droplet is considered to evaporate in an infinite medium of oil thereby hindering evaporation. Without density correction, the evaporation rate is significantly misestimated because the volume occupied by the NaCl in the droplet is not accounted which then affects the surface area to volume ratio. Remarkably, failure to correct for the relative humidity (due to the presence of neighboring droplet) and the changes in water activity (Raoult's law) led to a drastic overestimation of evaporation rate. This is because both cases directly affect the driving force for evaporation. The relationship between the effective relative humidity RHeff and the prevailing humidity above the oil RH\u221e is shown in Figure E To verify whether the saline droplets have a homogeneous composition throughout the evaporation process, we plotted the Peclet number as a function of time (see Section 6.2. of SI and Figure F ) and we found that the maximum Pe is in the order of 10 -4 suggesting a uniform droplet concentration.",

Our results demonstrate this with nucleation events spanning from 800 s to 1050 s (the grey area in Figure 4b ). In principle, these nucleation times can be used to estimate the interfacial surface energy of NaCl-water if we know the supersaturation ratio at nucleation Sn. To do this, several reports assumed a linear evaporation rate (neglecting changes in water activity) to calculate the droplet concentration as a function of time 32-34 . Here we highlight that this approximation can lead to inaccurate values of droplet concentration particularly in later stages where nucleation occurs. For instance, using our model, the supersaturation at nucleation Sn ranges from S = 1.50 to 1.75 (Figure 4b) . This is consistent with the results of Desarnaud et. al. 35 who showed a metastability limit of S = 1.60 for NaCl-water system using microcapillary experiments. However, if we assume a constant evaporation rate by extrapolating t = 0 and t = saturation time, the predicted range of Sn would be up to 40% higher (ranging from 1.75 to 2.50). This discrepancy would have a huge consequence particularly in crystallization studies. To illustrate this, we plot the cumulative probability distribution as a function of supersaturation at nucleation Sn in Figure 5 . The constant evaporation rate assumption clearly overestimates Sn resulting in unreasonably large values of supersaturation. Furthermore, if diffusive interactions and changes in water activity were not accounted for, much larger deviations could be obtained. All of these can lead to inaccurate values of nucleation kinetic parameters. Thus, we highlight the need for accurate modeling of evaporation rate of sessile droplets in the context of nucleation studies.",

Starting from well-established mass transfer equations for pure sessile droplets evaporating in air, we derived new expressions applicable for droplets with dissolved solute submerged in a thin layer of oil. Our model accounts for the additional complexity due to (i) variable diffusion distance due to the presence of oil (ii) diffusive interactions due to the presence of neighboring droplets (iii) density change as concentration increases (iv) water activity change as a function of concentration. By comparing our model predictions to experimental data, we showed that different contact-line behavior (CCR, CCA, or SS) results in almost identical evolution of droplet volume especially within the time scale relevant to crystallization studies. With this information, we analyzed the evaporation rate of saline droplets using the CCA model and using NaCl-water as a model system, we demonstrated for the first time that assuming a constant evaporation rate as well as neglecting the diffusive interactions between droplets can lead to severe discrepancies in the measurement of droplet concentration particularly during nucleation. This indicates that crystallization studies in literature that had used this assumption may be subject to large errors (In the example presented here, 40%). With our model, we can accurately determine the time evolution of droplet concentration which is important in quantifying crystallization kinetics. Moreover, given the importance of evaporation dynamics in a wide array of scientific and practical applications, our models and new insights presented herein would be of great value to many fields of interest.

In the extreme case of perfectly smooth chemically homogeneous surface, the droplet maintains an equilibrium contact angle, and this is referred to as constant contact angle (CCA) mode. Consequently, the volume decreases due to the continuous decrease in contact radius. 2 In practice, the droplet will be pinned due to surface roughness so the radius remains constant at some point. In the extreme case where the droplet remains pinned throughout its lifetime, we refer to this as the constant contact radius (CCR) mode. In this mode, the volume decreases due to the continuous decrease in contact angle. As experimental studies suggest, 11 real droplets evaporate in some mixture of CCR and CCA modes. One common observation is the occurrence of CCR mode at the beginning and once the contact angle decreases to a value less than the receding contact angle \u03b8r, it switches to CCA mode. This combination is known as the stick-slide (SS) mode. 11 In this work, we consider all three cases (CCA, CCR, and SS models) in analyzing the experimental data.",
