The secondary clinical outcomes were as follows, clinical improvement of symptoms surpassed 438,000 individuals throughout the world. The virus can aggravate an inflammation cascade and cause a cytokine storm. This is one of the major mechanisms that can cause the deterioration of the general condition in patients with COVID-19 infection. 2 Multiple different therapeutic options like antimalaria, HIV medications, antivirals, and steroids have been tried with limited results. The most notable was the compassionate use of remedisivir in the setting of COVID-19 infection. The original data initially encouraged the FDA to approve this medication for use in COVID-19 infections, but further clinical trials have not been able to support significant clinical benefit. Currently, no therapeutic agents have been proven to be effective in reducing the mortality and treatment of patients with COVID-19. [3] [4] [5] SARS-CoV-2 attaches to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor of the host cell via its spike protein. The virus has two pathways in which it can enter the cell, either Endocytosis or Non-endocytosis. Today, the newer viruses tend to use the non-endocytosis pathway which is activated by transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2). 6 Blocking the TMPRSS2 and the nonendocytosis pathway would be an interesting therapeutic option in preventing virus entry into the cell and therefore, treating the disease. Nafamostat and camostat mesylate, medications that are used to treat chronic pancreatitis are potential candidates for blocking virus entry by inhibiting TMPRSS2. 7, 8 There is some concern about the low distribution of these drugs in the respiratory system. As shown in Fig. 1 , another TMPRSS2 inhibitor with a greater distribution capacity into the lung tissue is bromhexine hydrochloride. 9,10 It is an old over-the-counter medication that has been used for several decades as a mucolytic agent. The current study, an open-label, randomized clinical trial, examined the efficacy of early start of oral bromhexine, in the intensive care unit (ICU) admission, rate of mechanical ventilation, and mortality in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. including fever, dyspnea, and weakness, assessment of C-reactive protein (CRP), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (NLR), and length of stay in the hospital. The clinical improvement was defined as the improvement of the patient's symptoms to the point that we were able to discharge the subject home and complete treatment as an outpatient. Clinical symptoms of the subjects included fever, cough, dyspnea, lassitude, myalgia, and GI symptoms, (nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea) which were ascertained by a physician blinded to the treatment allocation. A structured questionnaire for admission baseline and again at the end of the treatment period was used. In all patients, the NLR, CRP, and LDH levels were measured and recorded before the treatment onset and again at the conclusion of treatment. Oxygen saturation was monitored daily and chest X-rays were done as needed. Clinical stability and oxygen saturation \u226590% in room air for 48 hours were criteria for discharge home with isolation and all patients were followed for 28 days total.",

The clinical manifestations vary from a simple cough to fullblown acute respiratory disease (ARDS). Hypoxemia and oxygen desaturation, which have often been unresponsive to the usual therapeutic measures have led the patients to ICUs which often includes initiation of ventilation support and death. 11 Hypercapnia due to neuromuscular involvement, thrombotic events despite anticoagulation, and cardiac involvement might be contributing factors in the deteriorating respiratory condition leading to ICU admission and death. [12] [13] [14] It has been observed that there is usually rapid deterioration of the general condition within the first 24 hours of intubation and mechanical ventilation in patients with COVID-19 infection, having a direct correlation with poor outcomes. 15, 16 This observation might encourage intensivists to adopt a higher threshold for intubating patients with COVID-19 infection. It is prudent to consider ICU admission and intubation/ mechanical ventilation in this patient population as going into the danger zone rather than a bridge to recovery.
