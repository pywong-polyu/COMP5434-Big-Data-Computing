In France, the first confirmed case was reported on January 14, 2020. As an attempt to contain the virus, beginning on this date, all patients with confirmed COVID-19 were hospitalized, regardless of their medical condition. By March 15, 6,378 confirmed cases were reported in France, with a number of cases multiplied by 2 every 48 hours. Starting from March 15, 2020, admission in a hospital was not systematic but was based on the medical condition. Hence, patients with mild symptoms were no longer hospitalized. Hospital admissions for COVID-19 peaked on April 14, 2020, with a total of 32,131 patients hospitalized for COVID-19 in France. Approximately 83% of patients admitted to hospital for severe or critical COVID-19 were alive at Day 60 after admission [6] .

Potential adverse effects of the virus on maternal and perinatal outcomes are of concern. SARS and MERS during pregnancy are associated with various adverse maternal and neonatal complications [7] [8] [9] [10] . Altogether, most studies on COVID-19 have reported data from general population, but some recent studies have considered the specific situation of pregnancy. A case-control study in the United States of America comparing pregnant versus nonpregnant reproductive aged women with severe/critical COVID-19 showed that the clinical course and severity of COVID-19 in hospitalized pregnant women was worse compared to nonpregnant controls [11] . A report from the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention found that SARS-CoV-2-infected pregnant women were at higher risk of hospitalizations and adverse outcomes compared to nonpregnant women [12] . However, in this CDC report, data were not available to make the distinction between hospitalizations for COVID-19-related illness and admission for pregnancy-related conditions. Data on pregnant women with SARS-CoV-2 suggested that the virus might increase the risk of maternal and neonatal morbidities. A surveillance study of pregnant patients hospitalized with confirmed COVID-19 infection in the United Kingdom showed that most women were in the late second or third trimester, with potential maternal adverse outcomes [13] . A systematic review and meta-analysis of 77 studies showed that, recently, pregnant women with COVID-19 diagnosed in hospital might be at increased risk of admission to an ICU, more likely to experience preterm birth and their neonates more likely to be admitted to a neonatal unit [14] . Pregnant women seem to be more frequently admitted to ICU and require more mechanical ventilation when compared to nonpregnant women [11] . Similarly, results of a meta-analysis of 2021 suggested elevated rates of ICU admission in pregnant women with COVID-19 [15] . Consistently, relatively higher rates of preterm birth, preeclampsia, and cesarean section (C-section) in case of COVID-19 infection have been reported [15, 16] . Moreover, the incidence of stillbirth is significantly higher in the UK since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic [17] .",

            "text": "Before the emergence of COVID-19, coronaviruses responsible of the SARS and MERS epidemics were shown to have a negative impact on maternal and neonatal outcomes in pregnant women. Indeed, previous studies have reported higher risks of spontaneous miscarriage, preterm birth, intrauterine growth restriction, application of endotracheal intubation, admission to an ICU, renal failure, and disseminated intravascular coagulopathy in case of infection [7] [8] [9] [10] . This new form of coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, and its effect on pregnant women remains to be established. Our results are in line with previous literature. Notably, advanced age and having preexisting comorbidities was significantly associated with COVID-19 diagnosis, as pregnant women in the COVID-19 group of our study were significantly older and that women aged 40 and above represented a larger proportion in the COVID-19 group. In addition, we observed that obesity and history of hypertension were significantly more frequent among those with COVID-19. Consistently, increased maternal age, high BMI, chronic hypertension, and preexisting diabetes were reported to be associated with severe COVID-19 in pregnant women, and preexisting maternal comorbidity described as a risk factor for admission to an ICU and invasive ventilation [14, 15] . Furthermore, a prospective analysis of 23 pregnant infected women found that 48% of infected women had preexisting comorbidities, among which morbid obesity and diabetes were the most commonly represented [16] . We also investigated whether conception by ART was more frequent among those with COVID-19 diagnosis (in the hypothesis that placental pathologies known to be increased in pregnancies obtained by ART might represent an increased risk in an infectious context) but found no differences in frequency of pregnancies resulting from ART between those with and without COVID-19. Stratifying the analysis on whether the pregnancy was spontaneous or obtained with ART was not possible due to the small number of women in the COVID-19 group whose pregnancy had been obtained by ART in our cohort (n = 16). In addition, our results revealed that primiparous women were underrepresented among women with COVID-19. Likewise, active smoking during pregnancy was less frequent among those in the COVID-19 group. Consistently, data from recent studies suggest that active smokers are underrepresented among women with COVID-19 in the whole population [18] . The underlying mechanisms that could explain this decreased risk remain to be established.",

            "text": "Nevertheless, this study has some limitations. The first of them was that, despite the large size of the cohort, the study was underpowered for rare outcomes as VTE and amniotic embolization. Furthermore, the presence of COVID-19 was not explored in all women in our cohort but mainly in case of symptoms (acute respiratory syndrome, fever, and flu symptoms) or obstetric complications motivating hospitalization (such as risk of preterm birth, preeclampsia, and premature rupture of membranes). Thus, asymptomatic infected women might not have been detected in our study. However, results of our study demonstrate an increase in the frequency of cases having had both maternal morbidities and COVID-19 as identified by ICD-10 codes during pregnancy. Hence, the possibility that some women with asymptomatic COVID-19 might have not been identified does not alter the observed relationship between COVID-19 diagnosis and maternal morbidities. In addition, cases of women hospitalized with COVID-19 at 38 weeks of gestation or later could not be at risk of preterm birth, and term births very early in the pandemic could not have been exposed to COVID-19 at relevant time. Similarly, these facts do not affect the observed relationship between COVID-19 diagnosis and maternal morbidities that is shown in our results. Although we had information concerning maternal hospitalizations in ICU or death, no supplementary detail was available concerning COVID-19 symptomatology. Furthermore, the date of onset of the infection was not known. On the other hand, the possibility that asymptomatic women could actually have COVID-19 does not enable to formulate any hypothesis concerning the relationship between the severity of COVID-19-related symptoms and the occurrence and severity of obstetric pathologies described. In addition, we were not able to match maternal data with neonatal data collected in another register. Finally, this study does not provide information on the possible complications during early pregnancy such as miscarriage or medical terminations of pregnancy.",

We observed associations between COVID-19 diagnosis and several maternal morbidities and obstetric outcomes including preterm birth, preeclampsia, peripartum hemorrhage, and Csection. Women with COVID-19 diagnosis were more likely to be older and have obesity. The frequency of pregnancies resulting from ART was not different between the groups. In clinical practice, it appears essential to be aware of these complications, notably in populations at known risk of developing a more severe form of infection or obstetrical morbidities and in order for obstetrical units to better inform pregnant women and provide the best care. As the present study covers only women with COVID-19 diagnosed during the last second or third trimester of pregnancy, further studies are warranted to determine the impact of contracting COVID-19 during earlier stages of pregnancy.",
