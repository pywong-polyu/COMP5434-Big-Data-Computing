Deep learning techniques provide opportunities for radiologists and orthopedic to ease out their lives with faster and more accurate results. The traditional deep learning approach nevertheless reached its performance ceiling. Therefore, in this paper, we investigate different enhancement techniques to boost the deep neural networks performance and provide a solution as BoostNet. The experiment is categorized into four different phases. We have selected ChampNet from benchmark deep learning models (Effi-cientNet: B0, MobileNet, ResNet18, VGG19). This phase helps to obtain the best model. In the second phase, The ChampNet evaluates with different resolution datasets. This phase helps to finalize the dataset resolution to enhance the performance of ChampNet. In the third phase, Champ-Net merges with image enhancement techniques, Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE), High-frequency filtering (HEF), and Unsharp masking (UM). This phase helps to obtain Boost-Net with enriched performance. The last phase helps us to verify BoostNet results with Lightness Order Error. The presented research work fuses the image enhancement technique with ChampNet to generate BoostNet models. An assessment was performed on the Musculoskeletal Radiograph Bone Classification using classification schemes to demonstrate the proposed model's performance. The Classification accuracy of BoostNet was for the train a test dataset with and without enhancement techniques. The proposed model ChampNet ? CLAHE, ChampNet ? HEF, ChampNet ? UM approach achieved 95.88%, 94.99%, and 94.18% accuracy, respectively. This experiment leads to a more accurate and efficient classification model. The main aim of this paper is to enhance techniques to boost the deep neural networks performance and provide a solution as BoostNet.",

As the model layer extends to the 19th layer, the error rate of the deep learning model is saturated. To ease out the training of substantially deeper networks, the authors have developed a residual learning model (He et al. 2016a) . The model has achieved an error rate of 3.57 % on the ImageNet test dataset (He et al. 2016b) . In (He et al. 2016a ) authors have suggested the propagation formulation for a deep learning model to transmit backward and forward pass directly from block to block. In Howard et al.

The DLMs classify 1000 different object categories (mice, keyboards, pencils, and various animals, etc.). As a result, the DLM has mastered the rich features of classification for a wide range of images (Setiawan et al. 2019) . The network has an image scale of 224-by-224. The research shows that network depth is an essential component for improved performance (Zhang et al. 2015) . The drawback of VGGNet is that the assessment is costly higher and requires much more memory to handle 19.6 billion FLOPs and approx. 143 million parameters.",
