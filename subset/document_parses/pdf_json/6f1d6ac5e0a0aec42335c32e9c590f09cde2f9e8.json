The aim of this study is to define the clinical characteristics and rates of bacterial coinfections of infants < 90 days with FWS as the first manifestation of SARS-CoV-2 infection. This is a cross-sectional study of infants under 90 days of age with FWS and positive SARS-CoV2 PCR in nasopharyngeal swab/aspirate, attended at the emergency departments of 49 Spanish hospitals (EPICO-AEP cohort) from March 1 to June 26, 2020. Three hundred and thirtythree children with COVID-19 were included in EPICO-AEP. A total of 67/336 (20%) were infants less than 90 days old, and 27/ 67(40%) presented with FWS. Blood cultures were performed in 24/27(89%) and were negative in all but one (4%) who presented a Streptococcus mitis bacteremia. Urine culture was performed in 26/27(97%) children and was negative in all, except in two (7%) patients. Lumbar puncture was performed in 6/27(22%) cases, with no growth of bacteria. Two children had bacterial coinfections: 1 had UTI and bacteremia, and 1 had UTI. C-reactive was protein over 20 mg/L in two children (one with bacterial coinfection), and procalcitonin was normal in all. One child was admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit because of apnea episodes. No patients died.",

Two UTIs were observed in two patients: one of them with apneic episodes and the other with also a S. mitis bacteremia. This last child was diagnosed after this episode with Swachman-Diamond Syndrome and severe neutropenia, so he had a high risk of invasive bacterial infection. Otherwise, no other SBI occurred. SBI in under 90 days old infants occurs in 5-15% of the cases in FWS [1, 3, 22] . Differentiating which children with FWS have SBI may be challenging, mainly in young infants. Several algorithms based on analytical and clinical variables have been developed throughout the years to differentiate infants with low and high risk of having SBI [1, 3, 22] . Rapid tests to identify some of the most frequent viruses like influenza or respiratory syncytial virus are usually included in the initial approach of the FWS because SBI occurrence is significantly lower in infants with viral infections than in infants without viral infection [1, 2, 4, 23] . Accordingly, the approach to young infants with FWS in the ED during a SARS-CoV-2 pandemic or outbreak should include the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in the initial microbiological study.",

In this study, one child tested positive for RT-PCR several days after diagnosis. It is unclear if this test means that the child was infective, or if we detected only residual nucleic acid. Some of the infants who presented positive RT-PCR at admission might have undergone the infection days before. Serological tests that would confirm this in some infants were not available.",

Similarly, standardized recommendations for doing CXR at admission were not in place. This precludes any recommendation about the convenience of doing CXR in infants with FWS and SARS-CoV-2 infection. We had no information on maternal status before delivery, so congenital transmission cannot be ruled out, although it is really unlikely with current evidence.
