All 2434 cases of PICU admittance of MD patients were initially analyzed using a univariate logistic regression analysis of each predictor of PICU mortality (Table 3 , column A). In total, 2061 cases had a full data set and could be included in the multivariate logistic regression (where each predictor is fully adjusted for all the other predictors) ( Table 3 , column B). In the unadjusted model, neonates, patients aged 1-23 months, and patients aged above 18 had a significantly increased odds ratio (OR) of PICU mortality while patients in the span of 2-12 years appeared more likely to survive. In the adjusted model, only patients aged 1-23 months had a significantly increased OR. No race effect could be seen in the adjusted model, even though Hispanics appeared to have increased risk of mortality in the unadjusted model. Patients who were readmitted fared better compared to first-time patients in either model and so did post-operative patients, both groups with low ORs. Presence of invasive ventilation was the strongest independent risk factor for PICU death both in the unadjusted and the adjusted models. In the unadjusted model, cardiovascular and metabolic reasons for admittance were related to worse outcomes, but these effects did not persist after adjusting for the other clinical parameters. In the adjusted model, neurologic reason for admission was associated with a lower risk of death (the majority of these patients were admitted due to seizures), while no organ class significantly increased risk compared to the reference. Both trauma and prolonged length of stay resulted in higher OR for mortality in the unadjusted model, but these effects were no longer apparent after adjustment. The OR for each increasing unit of PRISM score was 1.2 in both models. A fully adjusted analysis where post-operative patients and trauma patients were excluded was also performed, with no relevant changes in the results (1676 cases analyzed).",

Presence of invasive mechanical ventilation and age 1-23 months were predictors of higher mortality. Patients readmitted to a PICU had a significantly lowered OR for death, possibly reflecting the waxing and waning disease course of many MDs, with metabolic crisis at times of increased metabolic demand, but also a natural recovery as the factor causing the crisis cedes, such as in case of temporally self-limiting infection. Patients with neurologic reasons for PICU admittance had a reduced OR for death and the most common reason for admittance for these patients was seizures. The presence of invasive mechanical ventilation, and age 1-23 months also increased the likelihood of a prolonged length of PICU stay, and so did admittance due to infectious reasons, reflecting the sensitivity to being burdened with the additional metabolic strain connected to an infection in these patients. Patients admitted to a PICU post-operatively not surprisingly fared better both regarding mortality and length of stay.",

Symptomatology and morbidity from MD may span from mild clinical symptoms barely affecting daily life to devastating multi-organ dysfunction at an early age. The symptomatology is likely to vary with function of the mitochondria and bioenergetic needs at baseline and during stress, with the extreme end being total mitochondrial dysfunction which is incompatible with human life. Cellular ATP requirement is dynamic and vary with the activity of the cell, tissues, organs, and ultimately individual. Physical strain such as exercise or illness can affect disease course and cause a metabolic crisis leading to clinical disease. Alternatively, reduced substrate supply for mitochondrial metabolism can hamper an already partly dysfunctional ATP production and lead to worsened disease, e.g. in cases of fasting. Thus, in patients with MD even a relatively commonplace affliction, such as an upper airway infection, potentially can lead to severe disease and PICU hospitalization.",

In this study, the organ system most commonly reported as the primary reason for PICU admittance is respiratory failure, but the database does not delineate whether this is the primary disease-causing event or a secondary feature. These data do not single out one organ class that have a higher risk of mortality, but demonstrate that patients with infections have a higher risk of prolonged PICU stay. Due to the mechanisms outlined above, patients with MD are more severely affected by infections due to the secondary cascade of energetic failure the increased strain on the system cause. Neurologic reasons for admittance came with a reduced risk of death, but not with a reduced risk of prolonged length of stay, possibly reflecting that seizures in themselves seldom are immediately lethal but may result in prolonged hospitalization.",

It could be speculated that centralizing care for these patients would improve quality, but the analyses performed in this study could neither prove nor disprove this. There are concerns of variations between centers in the care and treatment of these patients, which is not surprising considering the lack of evidencebased treatment options. 16 The Mitochondrial Medicine Society has published a consensus statement with recommendations on the treatment of these patients 17 including a section on critical care with some concrete recommendations such as that the use of valproate for seizure control must be avoided in these patients as fulminant hepatic failure has been associated with this medication, 17 Parameters available for analysis were restricted to those recorded in VPS, and did not include blood lactate, a clinical parameter traditionally considered of high relevance for patients with mitochondrial disease (base excess is reported as a part of the PIM2 score in VPS, but was only available in 11,6% of reported cases, and hence was not further analyzed). The data set is limited by the STAR/ICD9 code 277.87 which includes MELAS, MERFF, MNGIE, NARP, and Kearns-Sayre syndrome; however, certain other diagnoses may not be included. A notable example is Leigh syndrome, where patients do not routinely get the diagnosis code 277.87, but rather the non-specific ICD9 code 330.8 (\"other specified cerebral degenerations of childhood\") even though it is undoubtedly an MD. 19 This study is therefore not encompassing the full width of the MD spectrum. Also, the VPS database includes patients up to 21 years of age, an age that cannot be considered pediatric. The cases aged above 18 years make up 2.2% of the cohort. The current study used ICD9 codes; the ICD10 system include codes that more precisely codes for various MDs and would allow for both better coverage of the full MD field and also better resolution. This is important both due to the increasing accuracy for diagnostics of mitochondrial disorders and evolving diagnostic criteria 20 and future studies may provide further granularity. There is also a need to make a thorough analysis to define how this particular group of patients differ from other groups of PICU patients, and how to best optimize their care and treatments. ",
