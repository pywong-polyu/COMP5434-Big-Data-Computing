Results We found 356 references in the databases, 209 after duplicates removal, 23 met criteria for full-text reading, and 11 studies were included for qualitative synthesis, in four categories: virtual visits, use of remote technology, patient's satisfaction, multidisciplinary approach in teledentistry. We found that 78% of patients currently preferred teledentistry; 92% of patients would recommend the use of video consultation to other patients. The continuity of dental care, the reduction of patient visits to the hospital, the reduction of the risk of infection with the coronavirus, and limitation of face-to-face consultations to protect health professionals are benefits that reinforce the use of teledentistry by health institutions. Two studies showed patients' satisfaction with the use of teledentistry in monitoring cancer patients and showed an improvement in quality of life. Conclusions The teledentistry, as a remote technology for monitoring patients with oral and head and neck cancer, is well accepted by patients in preliminary studies. Although these studies pointed out some benefits of using remote technologies for the care of cancer patients, further robust scientific evidence is still needed in this regard.",

The pandemic has spread exponentially across the world causing, along with the so mentioned health burden, devastating global economic impacts [1] . The SARS-CoV-2 is highly contagious and can spread rapidly via respiratory secretions. Healthcare workers, particularly dentists, anesthetists, head and neck surgeons, ophthalmologists, and otolaryngologists, are at a high risk of infection [2] . As dental treatments invariably involve close inspection, examination, and diagnostic and therapeutic interventions of the naso-oropharyngeal region, dental professionals are most susceptible to get infected with coronavirus [3] . Owing to the transmission of COVID-19 through droplets and aerosols, which are inherent features of the dental practice, most of the countries followed a strategy of suspension of all elective dental care services and reserving it only for emergency cases [4] .",

TD (a subunit of telehealth along with TM) is the remote facilitating of dental care, guidance, education, or treatment via the use of information technology rather than through direct face-to-face contact with any patient [24] . Over the years, TD has proved to be beneficial for remote dental screening, making diagnosis, providing consultation, and proposing treatment plan [25, 26] . For this review, the concept of TD was standardized, acting on both dental and non-dental complications located in the oral cavity as a standard for conducting the search, selection, and analysis of studies.",

The social distancing and the need generated by the COVID-19 pandemic to remain at home generated a difficulty in conducting face-to-face consultations, which leads to the possibility of delay in the treatment of patients with oral cancer. TD emerges as an alternative to this demand, which is urgent given the current situation of social isolation [4, 31, 37] .

In this context, there is an increase in patient abstention from attending consultations to avoid the risk of infection. This fact is accentuated by restrictive measures by health authorities to protect patients at risk and staff. After an average period of 4 weeks of minimal activity, an increase in the flow of patients is observed, probably due to the increased demand for emergency dental treatment, despite the increasing number of active COVID-19 patients and related deaths during the pandemic [40] .",

Even with imaging technology, it may be challenging to visualize certain mucosal areas [43] . Some professionals reported that they were not satisfied making a diagnosis using telecommunication images without clinical information. Access to patient information is one of the main limitations that could affect the validity of TD. Face-to-face examinations provide an opportunity to talk with patients to obtain information essential to diagnosis. Lack of information could decrease the dental professional's confidence in making a diagnosis [34, 37] -Provide oral medicine care to potentially urgent cases with highly suspected malignant lesions [35, 36] -Allow follow-up, interviews, clinical examinations with the guidance of oral habits, control of the virtual education of the patients about the clinical signs and risk factors of oral cancer, reduce anxiety with information available in the common media, and permit a spatial appreciation of a lesion through video for their patients [4, 36, 40 ] -Promote better patient-professional communication before, during and after cancer care to maintain and improve patient's quality of life [35, 36] -Management by the dentist of the evolution of the lesions through the use of photographs and copies of the biopsy reports of the mouth sent by the patients in virtual consultations [ [34] using only a TD system and therefore diminishes the validity score of TD [26] . There is a difference between the benefits of using TD and the face-to-face clinical examination. Oral lesions, especially those with the potential for malignancy, are not effectively monitored by TD alone. In these situations, TD has the potential to ensure only a temporary adjustment until the clinical examination is possible to be performed in person.",

The TD model has some limitations, such as the inability to approach texture and clearly delineate the borders of a lesion, particularly in the posterior oral cavity, with an unreliable data connection and poor image quality. Factors linked to the patient, such as the ability to connect to the software, lighting, manual dexterity, familiarity with mobile/tablet devices, and the knowledge of the service user to attend technology-based consultations. Due to these considerations, video conferencing has a limited role and should be used with care [35, 46] . The accessibility of oral cavity to user-friendly imaging devices makes telemedicine an appealing solution for the management of secondary lesions as oral mucositis. Given the popularity of mobile phone-integrated cameras, the idea of obtaining images of the oral surfaces seems feasible; however, the quality of these photos does not enable us to apply this concept universally [47] .",

Nevertheless, this alternative of care presents many challenges, such as the lack of acceptance of TD by the dentists, fear of making an inaccurate diagnosis, concerns about increased costs, expenses, and necessary infrastructure, insufficient financial reimbursement, and inadequate guidelines. For the patients, the technology anxiety, isolation, feelings of neglection and fears, difficulties regarding the delay in cancer treatment, and access to support services during the COVID-19 pandemic should be considered.
