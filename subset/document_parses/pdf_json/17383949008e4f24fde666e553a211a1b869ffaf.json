Some benefits of online QI training delivery include fewer required resources, reduced need for on-site instructors, increased programme reach, and more control and flexibility over learning time for participants.

            "text": "An online QI programme can virtually connect users and provide them with an environment that balances training and practice [22] . Online delivery of QI training programmes requires fewer resources [19] , reduces the burden on sites and instructors [17] and the organisations do not need to maintain QI faculty [17] . It is useful in delivering a centralised QI curriculum to distributed learners [17] hence increasing the reach of the programme [19, 27] . Additionally, online learning seemed to balance the educational time constraints and clinical responsibilities in educating healthcare professionals [16] . Moreover, the IHI teaching modules used in this study are widely recognised and accessible to all programmes and learners [16] . Interactive, distance learning modules which occur in real time with multi-way communication, feedback and tailored education proved to be effective [17] . Online modules which are interactive were preferred by participants over static computerbased modules [16] . Participants in online QI programmes have more control over their learning time [27] , allowing them to complete much of the curriculum at a time convenient to them [31] . Programmes that are interactive and real-time in nature lead to better and personalised engagement from participants [17] . In the case of a flipped classroom where participants complete online modules prior to inperson sessions, the online component enables maximisation of in-class time [21] . However, many participants expressed that in-class sessions and in-class application were more effective than online content in enhancing their QI knowledge [16] . Similarly, viewing didactic material on videos beforehand enables participants to use classroom time to clarify concepts [25] and reduces the overall time required for the curriculum [20] . Alternatively, quiz-based online courses provide real-time feedback, engagement and healthy competition, but are more suited to reinforce concepts taught in classrooms and supplement other QI activities rather than as standalone activities [27] .",

The four levels of the Kirkpatrick Model, which measure participant reaction to the training, their learning, behavioural change and achievement of results are often used in the evaluation of training programmes [34] . An important consideration for future programme evaluation is that reactions to the training do not necessarily correspond to actual knowledge increase therefore QI curricula should be evaluated on multiple criteria rather than just on participant reaction [17] .
