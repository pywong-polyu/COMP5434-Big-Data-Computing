A total of 100 patients with SAP treated by the bedside continuous venous hemofiltration purification method in a hospital were selected. e control group (n \ufffd 50) was given a routine treatment, and the observation group (n \ufffd 50) was treated with the continuous blood filtration mode for blood purification based on the routine treatment. In the CT image scanning of periodontitis patients, the iterative reconstruction algorithm was introduced to reduce image noise, and the CT values under the algorithm were statistically analyzed. e results showed that IL-1, IL-6, and IL-8 after treatment were significantly lower than those before treatment (P < 0.05). e symptoms effectively improved with continuous blood purification combined with nursing intervention in patients with SAP. After the use of the iterative reconstruction algorithm, the image quality, image information, and image MSE significantly improved. e image noise with 50% dose reduction was the lowest, but the reconstruction algorithm improved the low contrast resolution (P < 0.05). CT images based on the reconstruction algorithm can clearly display the lesion characteristics of the patients, and the reconstruction algorithm is feasible to improve the spatial resolution of CT images.",

SAP is one of the common critical illnesses in the emergency department. Active inflammatory factors in the body during the onset lead to the release of a large number of cytokines, leading to the aggravation of the disease [2] . e secondary infection of the pancreas and the peripancreatic tissue further develops into multiple organ failure, which seriously threatens the life of patients and produces a higher mortality [3] . At present, the effective treatment for SAP is mainly the continuous blood purification treatment, which can quickly purify the toxins in patients, so as to reduce the impact of the toxins on the bodies of these patients, and the inflammatory symptoms disappear [4] . SAP has a variety of causes. Excessive drinking and drinking can cause poor drainage of the pancreatic duct, increased pressure in the pancreatic and biliary systems, and a high concentration of protease excretion disorders, resulting in the rupture of pancreatic vesicles. Bile duct inflammation, stones, edema, and other lesions can cause ampulla obstruction, bile reflux into the pancreatic duct, and trypsinogen activation. In clinical practice, many infectious infections can also promote the occurrence of acute pancreatitis [5, 6] . Continuous blood purification is a new blood purification method that continuously and slowly removes the water and solute in patients. By inputting a large amount of replacement solution to the patients and giving them intravenous nutritional support, it can promote the recovery of the patient's condition, and has a good effect in severe cases [7, 8] .",

In many cases, X-rays cannot provide sufficient information on the actual size of the lesion and the spatial position of the anatomical landmarks [9, 10] . CT scanning can show the volume increase of diffuse pancreas and the distribution of the pancreatic density, and enhanced scanning shows the pancreas has uneven mild enhancement, which can accurately observe the lesion site. Detecting acute pancreatitis using CT has advantages such as: fast CT scanning speed, strong ability of multiplanar reorganization and grading ability, avoiding respiratory movement artifacts and gastrointestinal gas influence, with high sensitivity and specificity. e severity of pancreatitis and the involvement of adjacent organs can be clearly judged, and the CT severity index score can be performed. However, in terms of the actual situation, the CT scan range is limited, and the scanned part is large, which leads to the detection data being truncated and not comprehensive. is situation will cause the possibility of inaccurate inspection results in the reconstruction of CT images. Moreover, due to the limitation of angles, CT images will produce a large number of artifacts in the scanning process. At present, how to reduce the generation of image artifacts in the case of reducing the radiation during CT examination has become a major research hotspot in the field of imaging examination.",

Figure 1 shows the imaging flow chart of the CT system. e converter converts the analog information into digital information, and then enters the electronic calculation. e information flow is provided by the highvoltage generator to generate X-rays. e CT machine is also rotated at this time. e detector collects data continuously.

At the beginning of each calculation, image assumptions should be made, i.e., a similar initial value for each image is set, and then the possible projection value is calculated after the light passes through the human body. Firstly, a virtual image is constructed, and the iterative model is constructed including the construction of the noise model. According to the actual measurement value, the hypothetical image is continuously modified repeatedly. e calculation results and the real projection results are analyzed to obtain the corresponding correction results. e pixel value can be corrected many times until all the images are completed. e purpose of iterative reconstruction is to obtain a more realistic original image. e CT iterative image includes two parts: the front projection and the back projection. e principle of signal-to-noise ratio reduction is shown in Figure 2 . e image is assumed, and then the initial value is set. e projection value of the light passing through the human body is calculated. e correction results show that the signal-tonoise ratio of the image is reduced, and the reconstructed image is obtained. e iterative reconstruction image is closer to the real image, and CT image reconstruction for patients can greatly reduce the scanning dose and effectively improve the image quality. e yellow arrow indicated the location of the lesion in Figure 2 .",

Continuous blood purification treatment uses the strong adsorption of polymer material filter to remove IL-6, IL-1, IL-8 inflammatory factors and toxic metabolites during tissue injury, which can promote the recovery of organ function and regulate immune function [17] [18] [19] . Zhu et al. [20] found that continuous blood purification can rapidly reduce the blood amylase and lipase in children with SAP, help maintain the stability of the internal environment, block the systemic inflammatory response, improve organ function, and maintain fluid balance. In this study, the inflammatory factors of IL-6, IL-1, and IL-8 in the two groups reduced after treatment. Continuous blood purification can effectively improve patients with SAP. As a fast-scanning technology, CT three-dimensional imaging can not only reduce the time of operation and imaging in the detection process, but also obtain more CT images and data information of lesions under the same scanning condition. en, with the assistance of computers, more highquality CT images are obtained for the diagnosis of patients' diseases. e processed CT images can not only be as intuitive as endoscopic images, but also improve the detection rate of small lesions. On this basis, further reconstruction of CT images by the iterative algorithm can improve the image quality.",

It is found that the iterative reconstruction algorithm effectively optimizes the CT image quality, information quantity, and mean square error. Among them, the MSE is the optimal value with the result close to 0. e iterative algorithm was used to reconstruct and denoise CT images. e results showed that the image quality, image information, and image MSE significantly improved after the use of the iterative reconstruction algorithm. e CT image based on the reconstruction algorithm could clearly display the lesion characteristics of the patients, and the reconstruction algorithm was feasible to improve the spatial resolution of the CT images. Tirkes [21] stated in the literature that CT and MRI cholangiopancreatography are common cross-sectional imaging studies for the evaluation of chronic pancreatitis. e reconstruction algorithm is applied to CT three-dimensional imaging. With the reduction of the dose, the image spatial resolution is effectively improved. Comparing the image noise, it is found that the image noise with 50% dose reduction is the lowest, and the reconstruction algorithm can improve the lowcontrast resolution. Gupta et al. [22] used CT to scan the gastrointestinal tract of patients with acute pancreatitis, and found CTfeatures such as maximum thickness of the intestinal wall, extrapancreatic necrosis, and intestinal wall thickening. CT is helpful to predict gastrointestinal fistula in patients with acute pancreatitis. Abdullah et al. [23] applied the iterative reconstruction algorithm to CT angiography. e results show that the iterative reconstruction algorithm can effectively reduce the noise of CT images and improve the signal-to-noise ratio. e results show that the iterative reconstruction algorithm has a good-quality effect in the CT image scanning of SAP patients.",
