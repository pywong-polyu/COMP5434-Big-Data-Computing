Hence, most of us have come out to a simple conclusion: SARS-CoV-2 infection might be our perennial unwanted risky \"companion\" for the next years. Ethically, we cannot afford to keep rejecting the performance of ordinary endoscopic procedures. Accordingly, our group, as others 6, 7 have been working on the design of a special \"droplets containing box\", aiming to reduce drastically the gastroenterologist's exposure to nasopharyngeal droplets generated during gastroscopy. For this purpose, herein, we summarize our experience with a simple dedicated gastroscopy box.",

A fluorescent dye (Glo Germ gel) detected by ultraviolet (UV) light simulated a patient's droplets. Five milliliters of fluorescent material diluted in ten milliliters of tap water was sprayed through the mannequin mouth. The endoscopist was positioned as for performing a gastroscopy and the mannequin was turned on its left side. The fluorescent color droplets were detected by UV light. Three positions were tested: With the box, the mannequin mouth is below the level of the box opening; With the box, the mannequin mouth is in the same level of the box opening and Without the box. When the gastroscopy-box opening was placed unevenly in regard to the simulator's mannequin mouth, the droplets were noted to be glowing inside the gastroscopy-box and on the scope. Only a few drops were detected on the hand holding the scope (shown in Fig. 2a) . On the contrary, placing the opening of the gastroscopy-box evenly with the mannequin mouth resulted in droplet's contamination of the scope, the holding hand and the gown (shown in Fig.   2b ). As expected, gastroscopy without the dedicated gastroscopy-box resulted in massive droplets contamination of the scope, the holding hand, the gown, and the bed (shown in Fig. 2c ) .",
