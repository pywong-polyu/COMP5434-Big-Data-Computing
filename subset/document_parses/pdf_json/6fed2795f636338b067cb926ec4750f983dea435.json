Regarding COVID-19, the human body temperature measurement can be obtained using LM 35, SMT 160-30, and DS 1820. Table 8 .1 below shows the characteristics of these sensors. \u2022 Pressure sensors-These sensors are based on the diaphragm contraction and relaxation. This sensor is designed as a belt [24] and an electromechanical film (EMFit), which is a capacitive pressure sensor that has a thin porous polypropylene film structure with a sensitivity of 30-170 pC/N. During the respiration process, the expansion of the chest exerts a force on the sensor and produces a voltage change proportional to this motion. The second type of pressure sensors is [25] designed as a facemask and used effectively during respiration when in contact with inhaled and exhaled air. The EMFit sensor performed well regarding the detection of respiratory rate. This sensor is suitable only for still or modest moving patients [24] because measurement accuracy depends on body movements. \u2022 Acoustic sensors-Acoustic sensors are used to monitor lung sounds and placed near the nose, mouth, throat, and suprasternal notch [18, 20, 26 ] to obtain the acoustic signals related to breathing. It is a user-friendly wearable device placed next to the nose using tape [18] . It measures the respiratory rate during sleep and sends the signals through wireless communication to a smartphone. The normal and abnormal lung sounds monitored and evaluated by the sensors are used to detect asthma attacks [28] . \u2022 Humidity sensors-Humidity sensors for breathing analysis [19] are based on a porous graphene network, which is a chemical structure capable of detecting moisture. This sensor senses the rhythm of human respiration, apnea, speech, and whistle. The sensors are attached to the body with a facemask. The disadvantage of using this sensor is that long time use is also uncomfortable. It still needs some improvements to further commercialization. \u2022 Oximetry sensors-Oximetry sensors measure oxygen saturation [27] . This sensor can be worn on different body parts such as wrist, finger, head, ear, thigh, and ankle. It measures the absorption of light according to the levels of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood. Oximetry monitors respiratory problems and blood oxygen levels. \u2022 Multimodal sensing platforms-It is a monitoring platform consisting of a chestpatch, wristband, and handheld spirometer [22] . The objective of this sensor is to track health and environmental factors for respiratory diseases such as asthma.",

On the body wearable devices are worn on the body and include accessories such as smart watch, smart band, smart jewelries, and smart clothing. Around the body devices work within proximity of the users. These devices collect data around the users such as environment data. The two devices involved in the wearable device framework are (1) wearable device and (2) Fig. 8.3 Wearable device-based health monitoring process devices sense data for the activity generation, and they have limited storage, low computation, and low battery power, whereas the host device has more computation power, larger storage capacity, and larger battery power. The wearable device collects the sensor data and can apply some pre-processing techniques to reduce the volume of data that can be transmitted to the host or can directly send the raw data to the host depending on the design of the device. It then sends the desired data to the host device. In [9] , the authors propose a daily activity monitoring wearable IoT device where some computation is performed at the wearable device before sending data to the host device. User's activities are collected using a 9-axis wristband. The data is pre-processed and segmented at the device level prior to sending to the host. However, the potential problem that needs to be addressed here is that it requires strong authentication and access control mechanisms to support the wearable devices and the data associated with them. An authentication is required to identify the authorized user of the device. An authentication based on the biometric parameters can provide an efficient solution to this.",

These data are preprocessed to prepare it for analysis [44] [45] [46] . In general, the wearable devices are application dependent. Most of these devices are integrated with communication abilities, limited on-board power management, and embedded computing facilities with a small storage support. The limited storage and computing facilities in the sensing devices and the limitations in communication bandwidth and battery power makes the wearable devices insufficient to work in an independent manner. Hence, the integration of these sensing devices with the IoT infrastructure provides a better platform for data aggregation, storage, and transmission, which provides a better analysis framework. \u2022 Networking Layer: The network layer configures the wearable devices using a standard or hybrid topology to provide interoperability, energy efficiency, network management, and QoS requirement. In addition, it should also maintain security and privacy of the user data from the personalized healthcare applications [8, 47, 48] . \u2022 Processing layer: The data processing layers suggested in [29, 43, 45, 49] use different intelligent algorithms, such as the supervised, unsupervised, semisupervised approaches; knowledge-based approaches, which includes semantic reasoning and modeling; or using hybrid approaches. \u2022 Application layer: The application layer of the WIoT architecture provides high quality services to healthcare providers as well as individuals [50, 51] . A userfriendly interface provides a better way to access these solutions to people who are typically not familiar with using intricate technological interfaces. Figure 8 .4 illustrates the general framework of various layers involved in the WIoT for the COVID-19 scenario. The main challenge in developing applications is that they should abstract the details that are irrelevant to patients or users and summarize the details appropriately to healthcare professionals to help them make appropriate decisions from their end.

The radio-packets are exchanged between the devices located within 1-1.5 m of one another. The sensors are also calibrated while the face-to-face closeness of two people carrying them can be measured over a period of 20 s with a likelihood approaching 99%. Therefore, contact data is obtained in a temporal resolution of 20 s: two persons are considered to be in contact over a 20 s time period if at least one packet is exchanged between their sensors within that time; and the contact event is considered completed, if the sensors do not exchange packets during a 20 s interval as described in (see http://www.sociopatterns.org) [59, 60] . The machine senses the close-up experiences through which an infectious disease transmission may be communicated, e.g., by coughing, sneezing, or handshaking [60] .",

Combined use of the detection algorithm and the wearables should help immensely to isolate and avoid further spread of COVID-19. Tracing the origin of an outbreak, quarantining patients who are potentially contaminated, treating critically ill patients, and preventing cross-infection between medical personnel and patients all take enormous human resources; and an intensified epidemic would further strain the systems.",
