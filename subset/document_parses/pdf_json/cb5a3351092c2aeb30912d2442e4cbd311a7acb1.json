We performed a systematic literature search using PubMed/Medline, SCOPUS, Web of Science, and Google Scholar databases to identify COVID-19-associated TTS case reports and evaluated patient-level demographics, clinical attributes, and outcomes. There are 12 cases reported of TTS associated with COVID-19 infection with mean age of 70.8 \u00b1 15.2 years (range 43-87 years) with elderly (66.6% > 60 years) female (66.6%) majority. The time interval from the first symptom to TTS was 8.3 \u00b1 3.6 days (range 3-14 days). Out of 12 cases, 7 reported apical ballooning, 4 reported basal segment hypo/akinesia, and 1 reported median TTS. Out of 12 cases, during hospitalization, data on left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was reported in only 9 of the cases. The mean LVEF was 40.6 \u00b1 9.9% (male, 46.7 \u00b1 5.7%, and female, 37.7 \u00b1 10.6%). Troponin was measured in all 12 cases and was elevated in 11 (91.6%) without stenosis on coronary angiography except one. Out of 11 cases, 6 developed cardiac complications with 1 case each of cardiac tamponade, heart failure, myocarditis, hypertensive crisis, and cardiogenic shock in 2. Five patients required intubation, 1 patient required continuous positive airway pressure, and 1 patient required venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. The outcome was reported in terms of recovery in 11 (91.6%) out of 12 cases, and a successful recovery was noted in 10 (90.9%) cases. COVID-19-related TTS has a higher prevalence in older women. Despite a lower prevalence of cardiac comorbidities in COVID-19 patients, direct myocardial injury, inflammation, and stress may contribute to TTS with a high complication rate.",

            "text": "Takotsubo syndrome (TTS, takotsubo cardiomyopathy, stress cardiomyopathy, or \"broken heart syndrome\") is characterized by acute left ventricular dysfunction usually in the setting of physical or emotional stress [1] . Conditions of acute stress leading to catecholamine surge have been suggested as pathophysiological mechanisms to date [2] . According to the World Health Organization, the current ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has infected over 10 million people and has led to approximately 500,000 deaths worldwide. A high burden of acute cardiac injury (19.7-27 .8%), leading to significantly high mortality, has been reported in these patients [3, 4] . COVID-19 patients with cardiovascular injury have been reported to have a high burden of underlying cardiovascular comorbidities [3, 4] . Furthermore, accumulating evidence suggests a picture of severe systemic inflammation and cytokine storm in COVID-19 patients [5] . Hyperinflammatory states could lead to acute stress and injury, evident from elevated markers of myocardial injury such as C-reactive protein, pro-calcitonin, creatine kinase, myoglobin, and N-terminal pro b-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) in these patients [6] . Emerging evidence suggests a picture of cytokine storm syndrome, resembling cytokine release syndrome, in COVID-19 patients [7] . It has been observed that cytokine release syndrome is accompanied by catecholamine surge [8] , which can predispose to TTS in COVID-19 patients. However, limited data on TTS in COVID-19 patients with only a handful of case reports promoted us to systematically review the published cases and pertinent outcomes.",

            "text": "To our knowledge, this is the first systematic review of COVID-19 patients developing TTS. Existing literature suggests that postmenopausal females are more prone to developing TTS [19] as was observed in our report. Loss of sympatholytic effect of estrogen and increased myocardial and vascular response to beta-adrenergic receptors in postmenopausal women has been suggested as one of the several reasons for increased risk of TTS [20] . However, it remains unexplored if this mechanism also poses a greater risk of TTS among elderly women with concomitant COVID-19 infection as compared with men. In this study, only a handful of cases reported classic triggering events like the development of TTS after physical stress like intubation and/or emotional stress pointing towards the physical or emotional stress towards the development of TTS in this COVID-19 patients [10, 11, 14] . However, a large number of cases did not report any particular triggering event. In addition to the physical impact, an emotional impact in the form of social isolation leading to anxiety and stress during this pandemic could also trigger TTS [21] . We found that more than half of the patients had a current or past history of underlying cardiovascular comorbidities including nonischemic cardiomyopathy in 1, hypertension in 8, diabetes in 5, and dyslipidemia in 1 case [9-13, 17, 18] . Patients with these comorbidities have a high burden of pro-inflammatory cytokines like interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) [22] . Although the exact mechanism of TTS in COVID-19 is not fully explained, a cytokine storm syndrome-like picture has been seen in COVID-19 patients [7] , with a high burden of pro-inflammatory cytokines like IL-6, which was reported in 2 cases [10, 18] . The cytokine storm syndrome has been noted to be accompanied by a surge in catecholamines [8] . This surge could lead to direct catecholamine toxicity and myocardial damage leading to TTS [23] . We noticed that COVID-19 patients had raised inflammatory markers in terms of raised CRP and ferritin. Furthermore, a high burden of pro-inflammatory state in these patients could lead to coagulation abnormalities and related complications. Bernardi et al., in their case report, descried left ventricular thrombus formation in a COVID-19 patient with TTS [24] .",

Furthermore, a modest increase in cardiac troponin and ECG changes suggestive of myocardial injury was noted in all the cases, which is commonly seen in TTS [26] , and could mimic acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Furthermore, SARS-CoV-2 infection could lead to myocarditis which could be misdiagnosed as TTS [15] . However, the absence of any significant coronary lesions, in most the patients who underwent coronary angiography, makes ACS an unlikely culprit. Besides, ventriculography demonstrated the apical ballooning in most of the cases [9, 11, 14, 17, 18] , apical hypo/ akinesia with or without basal hyperkinesia [9, 10, 12] , basal or mid and basal segment hypo/akinesia [12, [14] [15] [16] , and median TTS [13] characteristic of TTS variants. Even though most of the cases recovered and discharged successfully, more than 80% of the patients developed complications such as cardiac tamponade, heart failure, cardiogenic shock, myocarditis, hypertensive crisis, or respiratory failure. A marked decrease in the systolic left ventricular function has been reported in the acute phase of TTS [1] with a prognosis depending on the nature of triggering factors. TTS secondary to emotional factors has shown a good prognosis while TTS secondary to medical conditions or procedure has shown unfavorable short and long-term prognosis [27] . All patients with QT interval prolongation except one were on hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19 treatment. Hydroxychloroquine has arrhythmogenic potential and should be used cautiously in COVID-19 patients with a high burden of myocardial injury as it could further contribute to the risk of dysrhythmias and worse outcomes in TTS.",
