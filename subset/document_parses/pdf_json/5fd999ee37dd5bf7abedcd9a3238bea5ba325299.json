As World War II erupted, Japan quickly captured Java, the epicenter for the world's quinine production. The United States, caught offguard, suddenly found itself facing malaria across the globe without sufficient treatment. This unpreparedness resulted in major hospitalizations from malarial infections throughout different battles and theaters. 1 If the U.S. had invested into diversifying its quinine source well before World War II, the military would not have faced such a drastic shortage. Hurricane Maria devastated U.S. hospitals' small-volume IV saline supply 80 years after World War II. 50% of America's supply came from Puerto Rico, which enabled a single storm to catapult hospitals nationwide into a shortage. As was true for quinine and Java, this saline shortage highlighted that depending on 1 geographical region is rife with risk. Moreover, this risk is clearly higher for medications already in low supply, which is unfortunately a common scenario. 2 Action must be taken quickly, starting with healthcare leaders identifying which medications are mostly sourced from 1 area or country and then quickly diversifying them.",

At the start of the pandemic, China supplied active ingredients for most medications in the US. 3 Such dependence left the American healthcare system extremely vulnerable, and within a few weeks of viral spread in America, the demand on the medical system out-paced supply. 3 Importantly, PPE shortages contributed to the chaos as well. Approximately 66% of the global glove supply was sourced from Malayasia. 4 Yet, a disrupted workforce, and the desire to provide for its own country's needs led to a global shortage that reverberated in America. The lack of source diversification created a perilous scenario for the U.S. and forced hospitals into impossible situations.",
