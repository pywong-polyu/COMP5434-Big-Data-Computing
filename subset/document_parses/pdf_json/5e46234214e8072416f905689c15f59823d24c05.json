These data have been used to support geovisualization in geodesign workshops held in socially fragile and poor communities, in which people of the place have a vast knowledge about their territory but difficulties in working with cartographic representation and maps products. This study, therefore, presents the experiences earned in three geodesign workshops held in Belo Horizonte, Brazil, when aerial images in an oblique perspective and three-dimensional models with interactive navigation were used. The results allow us to conclude that the use of fields of view with an oblique perspective to the objects of analysis promotes a link between the zenithal cartographic expression and the immersive view in the landscape, which is a way for the formation of the mental maps. That is understood as an essential condition for the promotion of citizen participation in co-design processes, based on geovisualization and the sense of digital inclusion.",

This question worked only at the description level of spatial information, that is, without involving analysis or inference skills, but only of recognition and understanding of location [17] . Representational correspondence is also assessed, which refers to the ability to recognize on the map what is seen in the real world [18] . The second question worked on slightly more advanced levels of abstraction of spatial concepts. Children were asked that, understanding that a watercourse will flow from the highest parts of the land towards the lowest parts, draw a double line to indicate the position and the probable path of the stream that exists in the neighborhood. This question makes it possible to assess the ability to reason Source-Path-Goal demands [17] , which involves the perception of movement, the starting point, the way forward, and the destination. This understanding is linked to directional correspondence, which relates to the ability to interpret directions and, thus, link the map azimuth with that of the real world [18] .

In comparison with the other groups, it is clear that this concerns the rigidity imposed by the scale and fixed orientation of the printed map, making it impossible to choose other viewing perspectives or even to change the scale, to enlarge the elements on the map. It requires a higher capacity for spatial abstraction, for recognizing patterns and shapes of objects in an image with a zenith perspective that demands the ability to make associations between map and reality mentally.

All showed comprehension of the terrain shape and obeyed the logic that the watercourse flows from the top to the bottom of the slope, and the drawings, although showing rivers in places where there are no watercourses, followed this premise (Fig. 5) . Is was a significant gain because Group A showed inconsistencies in the drawing of watercourses. The children of Group B were also able to correctly identify the places with the most considerable risk of sliding in inhabited places and, also, they had a better sense of the dimension (scale) of the drawings, creating hatches with high precision in terms of area and position. Comparing with other groups, we understand that the quality of the answers of this group is not only in the use of the 3D model but also in its association with the printed maps. The printed maps contributed to consolidate the notion of scale, completing the flow of the abstraction process from the real world, passing through the virtual model, being synthesized by the 2D map and, thus, reaching the ability to express their thinking and understanding in a spatially coherent way and assertive.",
