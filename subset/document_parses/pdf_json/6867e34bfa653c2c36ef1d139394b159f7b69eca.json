According to the World Health Organization (WHO) latest numbers on July 21, 2021, over 192.8 million confirmed cases of COVID-19 and more than 4.0 million deaths worldwide. The clinical spectrum of COVID-19 pneumonia ranges from asymptomatic infection to critically ill cases (McArthur et al., 2020) . Critical patients with a higher mortality rate suffered from organ failure, including cerebrovascular accident (CVA), myocardial injury (MI), and thrombotic events . MI has been the most reported cardiovascular complication with a significant risk of inhospital mortality rate (51.2%) compared with those without MI (4.5%) (Bonow et al., 2020) . These findings suggest that early identification of patients with COVID-19 at risk of critical illness could improve their outcomes. Recently, several studies demonstrated that the higher levels of inflammatory markers such as C-reactive protein (CRP) (Wang, 2020) , ferritin (Lin et al., 2020) , D-dimer , high neutrophil-tolymphocyte ratio (NLR) (Kong et al., 2020) , and blood proteomic and metabolomic biomarkers (Wu D. et al., 2020; Shen et al., 2020) could be used to distinguish between moderate and severe cases. Unfortunately, so far there are no reliable indicators available to warn the COVID-19 progression and the occurrence of serious complications such as MI.",

Five-milliliter discarded plasma samples were collected from each patient as they were entering into the study cohort, and the results of clinical tests nearby were recorded. The plasma cfDNA was extracted using the Quick-cfDNA Serum and Plasma Kit (ZYMO) and then stored at \u221280\u00b0C. Each patient was prospectively followed up until hospital discharge or death. Complications during the first 28-day follow-up were evaluated and recorded: 1) MI, based on symptoms (if described), electrocardiogram/echocardiography (if any), and troponin I (TnI) (\u22650.4 ng/ml) (Dong et al., 2020) ; 2) gastrointestinal injury (GS), defined as occurrence of gastrointestinal haemorrhage, gastroparesis, and severe/acute pancreatitis; 3) sepsis-induced coagulopathy (SIC), defined as blood platelet <150*10 9 /L. The occurrence of all-cause death during the whole follow-up was confirmed by home page and final discussion in medical records. The Ethical Review Board of the Peking University Third Hospital approved the study protocol in March 2020 (IRB00006761-M2020083). On the basis of the consideration of discarded samples used, together with a complete set of information security system established, the informed consent of participants was exempted.",

Strikingly, consistent with our findings, 5hmC-enriched genes involved with immune response signaling pathways had higher mRNA differentially regulated 5hmC modified genes may have the potential to distinguish patients with COVID-19 from healthy people, and a unique combination of 5hmC modified genes would warn the disease progress.",

A total of 132 patients with COVID-19 (66 with moderate and 66 with severe) were randomly divided into training (n 78) and validation cohorts (n 54). Using the RFECV based on the logistic regression CV estimator, we reduced the number of DhMRs (15 DhMRs, |log2FoldChange| \u2265 0.5, p < 0.01, Supplementary Table S3) in the training cohort, which achieved the best cross-validation score. We found the 15 DhMRs (Supplementary Table S9) , selected by the LR model in the training cohort, that could distinguish severe patients from moderate patients in the training (Supplementary Figure S3A ) and validation cohorts ( Figure 3A) . Fifteen DhMRs could effectively warn moderate patients and severe patients in the training cohort [area under the curve (AUC) 0.94, 95% CI: 0.91-0.99] and the validation cohort (AUC 0.81, 95% CI: 0.77-0.85); see Figure 3B . Recent studies demonstrated that uncontrolled inflammation contributes to disease severity in COVID-19 (Wu C. et al., 2020) . By developing and validating our model, we also confirmed that certain inflammatory markers such as IL-6, D-dimer, NLR, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) could be used as predictors of COVID-19 disease severity. Notably, the combination of IL-6, D-dimer, NLR, and LDH as a warning indicator of disease progression achieved an AUC of 0.72 (95% CI: 0.65-0.78), which is lower than the 5 hmC indicators ( Figure 3C) .",

Therefore, the warning of patients who become critically ill has clear significance for the early treatment of COVID-19. To investigate whether the candidate DhMRs were associated with critical patients, we randomly separated 38 severe patients and 38 critical patients into training (n 53) and validation cohorts (n 23). Then, we examined the difference in 5hmC regions between severe and critical patients in the training cohort. Principal component analysis (PCA) based on top variance genes showed that severe patients could separate from the critical patients based on the 5hmC patterns ( Figure 3E) . Meanwhile, we conducted differential analysis (| log2FoldChange| \u2265 0.5, p < 0.01) and observed 8,756 DhMRs, including upregulated (n 7,442) and downregulated (n 1,314) regions in severe compared to critical patients ( Figure 3F and Supplementary Table S4 ). Using the RFECV based on the logistic regression CV estimator, we further reduced the number of top 200 DhMRs from the training cohort to 10 DhMRs (Supplementary Table S10), which achieved the best cross-validation score. In the validation cohort, 10 DhMRs differentiated severe patients from critical patients in the training (Supplementary Figure S3D) and validation cohorts ( Figure 3G) . The AUC value of this model for warning severe patients and critical patients was 0.92 (95% CI: 0.89 to 0.96, Figure 3H ), which was much higher than the clinical indicators showed, such as LDH (AUC 0.79, 95% CI: 0.74-0.84), IL-6 (AUC 0.62, 95% CI: 0.57-0.68), D-dimer (AUC 0.62, 95% CI: 0.56-0.68), and NLR (AUC 0.77, 95% CI: 0.72-0.83); see Figure 3I . These results implied that the 5hmC-based biomarkers of circulating cfDNA were highly indicating of COVID-19 progression. Gene functional enrichment analysis showed that upregulated 5hmC modified genes in the severe and critical patients were mainly enriched in neutrophil degranulation, neutrophil-mediated immunity, and neutrophil activation involved in immune response (see Supplementary  Figures S3B and S3C) , which are associated with development and progression of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (Wu C. et al., 2020) . Interestingly, PDE4D was one of the warning biomarkers that might indicate moderate to severe illness and severe to critical illness and mediate cell chemotaxis signaling pathways to affect the neutrophil-related immune system in critical patients (Supplementary Figure S3E ).",

            "text": "In our studies, about 19.7% (40 cases) of patients with COVID-19 had MI who required ICU admission and ended up with a higher mortality rate than those without MI (Supplementary Figure S4A) . Although the pathogenesis and biomarkers of COVID-19 have been reported, few studies addressed complications of COVID-19, especially MI. A total of 40 MI patients and 40 patients without MI were randomly selected from severe and critical patients and utilized in the warning model. Eighty patients were randomly divided into training (n 49) and validation cohorts (n 31). We observed MI patients separated from the without MI patients based on the DhMRs ( Figure 4A ). Meanwhile, we identified the 5hmC-enriched peaks in MI patients and found that MI patients enrich less peaks than without MI patients in different genomic characteristic regions, such as promoters and exon (Supplementary Figure S4B) . Similarly, we identified 3,068 DhMRs ( Figure 4B ) from the training set and generated a warning model using 12 DhMRs (Supplementary Table S11 ) from all DhMRs (| log2FoldChange| \u22650.5, p-value < 0.01, Supplementary Table S5 ) was able to effectively differentiate MI patients in the training cohort (Supplementary Figure S4C ) and the validation cohort ( Figure 4C ). In the validation group, the AUC value of this model for early warning the patients whom potentially at risk of MI was 0.89 (95% CI: 0.84 to 0.95, Figure 4D ). This indicates that DhMRs could be early warning signs for complications of COVID-19. Besides that, we found that the 5hmC characteristics from cfDNA could be separated from other complications, such as GS and SIC (Supplementary Figures S4D and S4E , Supplementary Table S6 and S7) , and separate between the non-survival patients and survival patients (Supplementary Figure S4F, Supplementary Table S8 ). These results suggest that the 5hmC is a potential tool for the warning of COVID-19 progression and its complications. To explore the correlation of DhMRs and tissue-specific genes, we initially evaluated the tissue-specific transcriptome profiles of heart tissue from autopsies of healthy and patients with COVID-19, and human embryonic stem cell (hESC)-derived cardiomyocytes in GSE151879 datasets. Comparison between our 5hmC-seq and RNA-seq data, we found that, in addition to the unique genes between three groups, there are 75 and 14 overlapping genes in upregulated genes and downregulated genes, respectively ( Figures 4E,F) . In particular, we found a common gene, PDE4D, in all three warning models, and PDE4D are highly expressed in the heart tissue from patients with COVID-19, especially in hESC-derived cardiomyocytes ( Figures 4G,H) . Recent studies showed that uncontrolled inflammation contributes to the disease severity (Del Valle et al., 2020) . Our study found the 5hmC modified genes of critical patients enriched in neutrophil-mediated immunity pathways consistent with previous research indicating that the neutrophil elastase inhibitor (Sivelestat) is a promising therapeutic option in COVID-19 with ARDS (Sahebnasagh et al., 2020) . To investigate whether there are other targets for the MI or patients with a high risk of death, we examined the pathway enrichment in 75 overlapping genes. We found several immune-related signaling pathways, including chemokine activity, neutrophil chemotaxis, and CD4-positive, alpha-beta T cell activation pathways ( Figure 4I ). Among them, PDE4D plays an important role in the immune signaling pathway and influences the immune system by activating chemokines and mediating neutrophil chemotaxis ( Figure 4I ). Interestingly, we found that the 5hmC modification level of PDE4D, a drug target for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (Yuan et al., 2016) , was significantly increased in the death group and MI group ( Figure 4J ). In addition, hydroxymethylation levels were significantly reduced in MI patients (Supplementary figure S4B) , and the TET2 enzyme, which can catalyze the conversion of 5methylcytosine (5mC) to 5hmC, had a lower 5hmC level in the death group and MI patients' group ( Figure 4K ).",

Our primary analysis found the patients' groups enrich more peaks than the healthy group, and 5hmC marker genes differed by clinical characteristics of patients at diagnosis. We have identified COVID-19-associated 5hmC signature peaks enriched in the gene bodies and promoter regions (Figure 2A) . The COVID-19-associated 5hmC signature gene was enriched in the neutrophil migration pathway, consistent with the previous studies that reported neutrophils and neutrophil extracellular traps drive necroinflammation in COVID-19 (Tomar et al., 2020) . Moreover, we developed a machine learning model based on 5hmC data from patients with COVID-19 at different disease severity classes (moderate, severe, and critical) to warn the disease progression. The 5hmC indicators model improved accuracy compared to the clinical markers such as LDH, and NLR (Figures 3B, C, H, I) . Overall, these findings suggest the profiled genome-wide 5hmC in cfDNA from blood plasma can be regarded as an early warning of critical illness in COVID-19. Immune phenotyping based on the LDH, IL-6, D-dimer, and NLR is a well-established marker in predicting disease severity and ICU-mortality outcomes in patients with COVID-19 . However, few studies were focused on the complications, diagnosis, and warning. COVID-19 is regarded as a systemic disease involving multiple systems, including cardiovascular, respiratory, gastrointestinal, and immune system (Iddir et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2020) . Our results confirmed that patients who suffer from MI had higher mortality (Supplementary figure S4A) , and 5hmC was a potential warning biomarkers of occurring MI in the COVID-19 ( Figure 4C ).",

            "text": "Our research tried to expand the application of 5hmC markers in the disease, especially for exploring the potential therapeutic targets (Supplementary figure S3E) . There are two primary reasons that we think this strategy is reliable. First, Cui et al. performed the 5hmC-Seal and RNA-seq in 19 human tissues derived from 10 organ systems and found that genelevel 5hmC modifications can reflect the gene expression status in different human tissues (Cui et al., 2020 ). This indicates that 5hmC level is associated with gene expression, consistent with previous studies. Second, several targets used for COVID-19 treatment were also found in our results, including TET2 (Zhang et al., 2021) and neutrophilmediated immunity pathway (Sahebnasagh et al., 2020) . In addition, for the MI, the 12 5hmC-enriched regions (hMRs) were able to differentiate and predict effectively. Interestingly, in a previous study, MAP4K4 (from the 12hMRs) has been to promote cardiac muscle cell death (Virbasius and Czech, 2016) . Moreover, MAP4K4 carried a higher 5hmC modification, which positively regulated the gene transcription. MAP4K4 is a key kinase in the mating pathway and is involved in many aspects of cell functions and pathological processes (Yue et al., 2014; Gao et al., 2016) . Several studies found MAP4K4 as a therapeutic target in cancer (Gao et al., 2016) .

We found a potential target for the COVID-19 besides the known targets, such as the PDE4D. In our study, PDE4D was one of the 10 DhMRs that warn severe to critical illness and may mediate cell chemotaxis signaling pathways to affect the neutrophil-related immune system (Supplementary figure S3E) . We speculated that the PDE4D could be a potential drug therapeutic target of COVID-19, especially for critical patients. GSE151879 data showed that PDE4D was highly expressed in the heart tissues of patients with COVID-19, especially in hESCderived cardiomyocytes. It also implicated that PDE4D might play an important role in the immune system, for influencing the immune system by activating chemokines and mediating neutrophil chemotaxis ( Figure 4I ). In addition, TET2 had a lower 5hmC level in the death group and MI patients' group ( Figure 4K) , and vitamin C restoring TET2 function could provide therapy for patients with COVID-19. Recent studies consistently demonstrated that a high dose of intravenous vitamin C could improve outcomes and reduce mortality for patients with COVID-19 (Zhang et al., 2021) . We believe that the combination of PDE4D inhibitor and vitamin C is a potential drug combination for the treatment of COVID-19, especially in severely ill patients.",

First, the number of cases was small, and small cases were used in the machine learning model generation, but our study was the first study using 5hmC as warning biomarkers in patients with COVID-19 and the exploratory study found the relevant targets may have some far-reaching significance. Second, although some clinical information is missing, it does not involve important variables. For example, we used the TnI instead of the electrocardiogram and/or echocardiography for the MI diagnosis. Third, all of the targets should be confirmed by further validation. In current pandemic, we believe that showing this important discovery in advance maybe attract more attention to understanding this new disease. Of course, we are already working on validation studies.",
