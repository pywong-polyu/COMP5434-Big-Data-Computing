            "text": "Clubfoot treatment using the Ponseti method has been severely impacted as a result of lockdown measures implemented by several countries during the COVID-19 pandemic. As clubfoot clinics begin phased re-opening, we describe various innovative techniques to protect patients and healthcare providers during delivery of clubfoot treatment services. In addition to standard social distancing measures and sanitization protocols, we report a simple and innovative technique of 'barrier casting' or 'ring-fencing' to potentially reduce the risk of droplet infection and airborne transmission during clubfoot casting and tenotomy. A transparent, disposable plastic drape is set up as a curtain and serves as an impermeable barrier between the caregiver and healthcare provider performing the casting or tenotomy. The plastic drape is cheap (< US$ 1.5), easily available and can be used effectively even in low-and middle-income countries which have a high patient load. We have utilized these innovative techniques in 43 consecutive patients since clinic re-opening and are satisfied that they are effective, economical and easily reproducible even in countries with limited resources. Innovative techniques, which have the potential to reduce the risk of disease transmission, will help in the rapid recovery of clubfoot treatment services as countries emerge from months of lockdown.",

            "text": "The Coronavirus disease pandemic , caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus has spread all across the globe, affecting 213 countries since January 2020. In an attempt to arrest community transmission and slow the spread of the virus, several countries initiated complete or partial lockdowns of their populations. India, the 2nd most populous country in the world [1] , announced an immediate and total lockdown of its 1.35 billion population on 24th March 2020, when the number of confirmed positive COVID-19 cases in the country had reached ~ 500 [2] . Overnight, all non-essential private and public transport services including road, rail, metro and suburban trains, and domestic and international flights were suspended; educational institutions and commercial establishments were shuttered; and all social, political, cultural and religious gatherings were prohibited [2] . Along with banks, pharmacies, grocery shops & other essential services, hospitals were permitted to functionbut at reduced capacity and mainly to provide emergency and essential patient care. Routine outpatient services were severely curtailed and elective surgeries and procedures were encouraged to be postponed or cancelled. The lockdown was extended in 3 more phases on 14th April, 3rd May and 17th May 2020, with some relaxations permitted in non-COVID hotspots (designated as 'orange' and 'green' zones) starting early May [3] . From 1st June 2020, the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) announced phased re-opening of the nation with gradual lifting of restrictions, except in the so-called 'red containment zones' [4] . A group of researchers from the University of Oxford designated India's lockdown as 'one of the most stringent in the world', scoring a perfect 100 ",

As we gradually open up clinical services in a phased manner, our clinic has devised some innovative measures to permit safe delivery of clubfoot treatment while protecting our patients and doctors from risk of exposure to infection.

Patients with fever and/or respiratory symptoms are referred to the Fever and Flu Clinic. 2. Calling clubfoot patients by appointment only, so as to ensure that there is no over-crowding in the waiting area and social distancing norms can be maintained. Since ours is a public hospital, the Paediatric Orthopaedic outpatient clinics were frequently over-crowded with up to 40-50 patients per clinic in pre-COVID times ( > 10,000 outpatient visits per year). 3. Permitting only one caregiver with the baby inside the treatment room during casting, tenotomy and bracing. 4. Providing required personal protection equipment (PPE) to healthcare providers (doctor/assistant) in the form of FFP2 mask, plastic face shield, cloth gown and nonsterile gloves, since the main modes of transmission are considered to be droplet infection and airborne transmission of the virus [8] . 5. Ensuring caregiver wears a face-covering or mask and performs hand sanitization before entering the treatment room. 6. Practicing 'barrier casting' or 'ring-fenced casting'. This is a novel and innovative measure which seeks to isolate the healthcare providers from the patient and caregiver by providing a fluid-impermeable plastic barrier between the two.",

Two holes, which are roughly the circumference of the child's upper thigh, are carefully cut out in the drape and the child's legs are slid through the holes allowing a snug fit of the plastic drape on the upper thighs (Fig. 2a,  b) . The proximal part of the drape is held up vertically on supporting stands, thus creating an impermeable but transparent barrier, between the patient and caregiver on one side of the barrier and the healthcare provider and casting assistant on the other side (Fig. 3a, b) . The distal part of the drape lies beneath the legs of the patient and falls over the edge of the table so as to protect the caster from wet plaster spillage during the casting and moulding process. The transparent plastic drape not only creates a physical barrier between patient and provider, but also permits the provider to keep a watch over the baby to avoid undue force and discomfort during manipulation and casting (Fig. 4a, b) . The disposable plastic drape is easily available at a cost of ~ Rupees 100 (US$ 1.30) and should be discarded and replaced with a new one between consecutive patients.",
