The commons, thought as instituting praxis that provide social goods based on autonomy and reciprocity, can help in understanding the role of this age group in providing care to the rest of society. This approach overturns the way economic literature approaches the aging phenomenon. What is understood as a \"common evil\"-or a problem that needs to be solved-can be analyzed as a \"common good.\" From this perspective, older people (population aged 65 and over) are essential to European society and the economy to carry out informal care activities that enable and facilitate the \"productive\" activities of working people.",

Overlooking the paternalistic relationship with the public and/or the blind acceptance of market forces, the commons reveal the possibilities and potential of collective self-organization for sustainable management of different social goods, such as de provision of reproductive work. The paradigm of the commons includes all (self)-transformative activities, performed by subjects that are able to create new institutions in search of higher degrees of human autonomy (59, 60) . In fact, \"the so-called common goods are not just goods; they are not \"things\" that are separate from us, they aren't even just shared goods. (. . . ). They are social practices of commoning, based on the principles of sharing, caring and producing jointly\" (54) .

A debate that, moreover, is divided between research that defends a significant and negative relationship (65) (66) (67) and, on the other hand, authors who do not believe that such a relationship exists (28, 52, (68) (69) (70) . However, the authors of this research believe that the debate on the wealth generated by older people must go beyond the purely economic. In order to understand the role that older cohorts play in our societies, it is necessary to broaden our understanding of prosperity and development. Indeed, if we go down this path we will be able to recognize that older people have shown to be more providers than receivers of support up to the age of 80 (52) . In other words, older people continue to generate wealth in social and family terms wellbeyond the age of 65. Along these lines, Dur\u00e1n (4) notes that older people have \"a role in the production and consumption of nonmonetary services within households\" as well as an important role in the production of volunteer services. These contributions can be exemplified by the fundamental contribution-both monetary and care-of older people to their children and grandchildren after the severe economic crisis in Spain in 2008, or the research about how older people are potentially very important contributors in local voluntary organizations (71) . As shown in Table 2 , Spain has a significant population over 64 years of age, and a progressive aging of the different groups within this age cohort (younger elders, older persons, and very old people).",
