            "text": "S ince December 2019, several pneumonia cases of unknown cause, induced by COVID-19, have been reported in Wuhan, China. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] According to the World Health Organization, an epidemic is an \"out-of-the-ordinary\" outbreak of a disease that is usually transmitted from person to person or animal to human through an infectious disease or is caused by exposure to hazardous chemical sources and radioactive materials. [7] The cause of this disease was a new and genetically modified virus from the family of coronaviruses called SARS-CoV2, which was named COVID-19. [8] Most coronaviruses are not dangerous, but some of them can cause severe respiratory disorders. [9] Between 2002 and 2003, SARS-CoV caused an outbreak of pneumonia in 8000 cases and spread to more than 30 countries and five continents and is now considered an eradicated disease. MERS-CoV was identified in 2012, [10] which causes pneumonia in humans and have been reported it's fatality rate more than 30%No specific antiviral treatment is available for it, and the treatment is mainly supportive and symptomatic. [11] The third outbreak of the virus, SARS-CoV2, spread rapidly throughout China and many countries. [12] [13] [14] [15] Due to the very high transmission power, it covered the whole world in less than 4 months. [16, 17] On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the disease pandemic outbreak to make its importance more apparent to everyone. According to the World Health Organization, from the outbreak of the disease until January 17, 2021, 93,194,922 cases and 2,014,729 deaths following the disease have been recorded worldwide. [7] The United States, India, and Brazil are the three countries with the highest rates of COVID-19, respectively. In Iran, the first case of COVID-19 was reported on February 19, 2020, in Qom. [18] On February 20, 2020, the Ministry of Health and Medical Education approved two cases of COVID-19 in Qom as the center of this disease. [19] There have been several issues to overcome in this unusual deal encompassing insufficient information, poor understanding of the risk of the virus, and lack of belief in vulnerability; by these issues, the disease quickly spread in Tehran as the commercial capital and in the northern regions of Iran due to their tourist attractions. In Iran, COVID-19 spread more rapidly due to the Iranian New Year. [20] According to the report of the World Health Organization, as of January 17, 2021, 1,324,395 cases and 56,717 deaths were registered in Iran. [7] The most essential challenge posed by this pandemic is to endanger the health and lives of people around the world, where many people are infected with this acute viral illness every day, and some of them die. [21, 22] The global spread of the virus has affected global health systems and the world economy. [23] It also has led to political, social, psychological, and commercial consequences. [24] To reduce the damage associated with COVID-19, public health measures are needed to promote health and control infection to limit the virus's spread worldwide. [25] Knowledge of the epidemiological characteristics of the deceased, underlying causes, and comorbidities is of particular importance for estimating the course of epidemic diseases as well as the implementation and evaluation of death prevention methods. Based on the report issued by the COVID-19 Epidemiology Committee of Iran on October 16, increased incidence and mortality rates of the disease in the country, and third wave of coronavirus in seven provinces, including Mazandaran, [26] this study aims to provide epidemiological characteristics of the patients died because of COVID-19 in the medical centers affiliated to Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences.",

Exclusion criteria include people whose information has not been fully registered or has been admitted in a period other than the specified range.

Still, unlike the northern regions of Iran, in the southern cities, we have seen less prevalence in the first wave, which can be related to factors such as cultural differences, lifestyle, transportation, seasonal workers, tourist rate, and city population; for example, the volume of travel to the northern provinces of Iran is very high, or the high prevalence of the virus in Isfahan or Mashhad and Mazandaran province can be due to the tourist attractions cities. Beyond, the amount of In metropolises such as Tehran, due to high population density and increased use of public transport, mainly subway, the virus's prevalence is high compared to other places in the country. [27, 28] A geographical analysis of the epidemiology of coronavirus has shown that the virus has been detected in areas around Tehran province and also in the northern, western, and northwestern regions of the country. Spatial and geographical studies show that the essential factors in the spread of the COVID-19 virus in the country are population concentration and geographical distance from population centers, which have accelerated the reach of this contagious disease. [29] Paying attention to these factors can be very important in managing disease control and prevention.",

The COVID-19 mortality rate in this study was 8%, and the men's mortality rate was 1.1% higher than women's. In a study entitled \"Epidemiological characteristics of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients in Iran\" conducted by Nikpouraghdam et al., on 2968 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 from February 19, 2020, to April 15, 2020, it was figured out that most patients were in the age group of 50-60 years. The male-to-female ratio was 1:1.93. A total of 239 deaths (8.06%) occurred among hospitalized patients. 10.89% of the total patients had underlying diseases. Diabetes, chronic respiratory diseases, hypertension, cardiovascular disease (CVD), chronic kidney disease (CKD), and cancer were the most common comorbidities in deceased patients. Male gender, older age, and underlying diseases were associated with mortality. [30] In a meta-analysis conducted in Iran in 2020, Keyvan Heydari et al. systematically investigated the clinical and paraclinical characteristics of patients with COVID-19. In the meta-analysis, 32 articles, including 49,504 patients with COVID-19, were reviewed. The most common clinical symptoms were fever (84%), cough (65%), and fatigue (42%). Further, the overall mortality rate was reported at 3%. [28] In the study conducted by Rothan et al., the most common symptoms at the onset of COVID-19 illness reported: fever, cough, and fatigue, while other symptoms include sputum production, headache, hemoptysis, diarrhea, dyspnea, and lymphopenia. [31] Based on the data from the Chinese National Reporting System, as of February 20, 2020, the median age of the confirmed cases was 51 years (2 days-100 years), of which 77.8% were 30-69 years. A total of 51.1% were male. [32] Fever, dry cough, and fatigue were more commonly reported, whereas nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, sore throat, and myalgia were relatively rare. [33] In Bargain's review article, major comorbidities that seen in the overall population were cardiovascular diseases ( [34] In the systematic review and meta-analysis study of Singh et al., the pooled prevalence for comorbidities in patients with COVID-19 disease was 22.9% for HTN, 11.5% for diabetes, and 9.7% for CVD. For COPD, CKD, cerebrovascular disease, and cancer, the pooled prevalences were all <4%. Except cerebrovascular disease, all the other comorbidities presented a significantly increased risk for having severe COVID-19. Further, the risk of mortality was significantly increased in individuals with CVD, COPD, CKD, cerebrovascular disease, and cancer. [35] Based on the Kazemi-Karyani et al.'s study, the case fatality rate of COVID-19 in the world by April 30, 2020, was 7.05%, which ranged from 3.74% in the African region and 9.48% in the European area. [36] In the present study, respiratory distress, fever, and cough were the most common clinical manifestations of the disease in the deceased people, respectively, and the overall mortality rate was 8%. One of the essential needs to prevent the disease's spread is to know the disease's epidemiology. In this article, epidemiology, information on risk factors, symptoms, and common underlying diseases in the death of patients in the North of Iran are presented in two peaks of COVID-19.",
