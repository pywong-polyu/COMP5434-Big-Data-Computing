However, the effects of an individual PEEP-optimisation on respiratory mechanics, oxygenation and their potential correlation with the inflammatory response and postoperative complications have not been evaluated have not been compared to standard LPV in patients undergoing major abdominal surgery. Thirty-nine patients undergoing open radical cystectomy were enrolled in this study. In the study group (SG) optimal PEEP was determined by a decremental titration procedure and defined as the PEEP value resulting the highest static pulmonary compliance. In the control group (CG) PEEP was set to 6 cmH2O. Primary endpoints were intraoperative respiratory mechanics and gas exchange parameters. Secondary outcomes were perioperative procalcitonin kinetics and postoperative pulmonary complications. Optimal PEEP levels (median = 10, range: 8-14 cmH2O), PaO2/FiO2 (451.24 \u00b1 121.78 mmHg vs. 404.15 \u00b1 115.87 mmHg, P = 0.005) and static pulmonary compliance (52.54 \u00b1 13.59 ml cmH2O-1 vs. 45.22 \u00b1 9.13 ml cmH2O-1, P < 0.0001) were significantly higher, while driving pressure (8.26 \u00b1 1.74 cmH2O vs. 9.73 \u00b1 4.02 cmH2O, P < 0.0001) was significantly lower in the SG as compared to the CG.

However, it should not be forgotten that PEEPopt is rather a compromise than a realistic goal due to the heterogenous regional distribution of ventilation and compliance of the lungs. A PEEP that is appropriate in one region may be harmful in another one: in non-dependent lung parts overinflation can occur, in dependent parts atelectasis may develop [53, 54] . Maisch et al. defined PEEPopt as the PEEP that prevents atelectasis after ARM and minimizes alveolar dead space ventilation without over-distension [55] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 119, "end": 123, "text": "[49]", "ref_id": "BIBREF48"}, {"start": 124, "end": 128, "text": "[50]", "ref_id": "BIBREF49"}, {"start": 129, "end": 133, "text": "[51]", "ref_id": "BIBREF50"}, {"start": 463, "end": 467, "text": "[23]", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 686, "end": 690, "text": "[52]", "ref_id": "BIBREF51"}, {"start": 1045, "end": 1049, "text": "[53,", "ref_id": "BIBREF52"}, {"start": 1050, "end": 1053, "text": "54]", "ref_id": "BIBREF53"}, {"start": 1204, "end": 1208, "text": "[55]", "ref_id": "BIBREF54"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "There are several types of PEEP titration methods in order to determine the individual PEEPopt. Static or dynamic pulmonary compliance directed methods, Vds/Vt guided technique based on volumetric capnography or electrical impedance tomography (EIT), and transpulmonary pressure directed PEEP titration procedures are worth to mention [56] [57] [58] [59] . Most authors agree that decremental titration should be performed, however, there is no recommendation about best practice. Pereira et colleagues found that EIT guided PEEP individualization could reduce PPC while improving intraoperative oxygenation and reducing \u0394P as well, causing minimal side effects [51] . [60] . Additionally, in two Italian physiological studies conducted by D'Antini and Rauseo in 2018, OLA applying titrated optimal PEEP levels resulted in improved respiratory mechanics, better gas exchange, decreased transpulmonary pressures and \u0394P without significant haemodynamic effects [24, 25] . Reducing \u0394P as a goal of ventilatory settings has some rationale: decreased lung stress and strain may attenuate intrapulmonary inflammatory response [61, 62] . On the one hand, surgery, especially major abdominal surgery, alone induces host inflammatory response via damage associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) pathway that is necessary for postoperative recovery, however an overwhelming inflammatory response may lead to multiorgan dysfunction in the postoperative period [10, 11, 14, 16] . On the other hand, injurious intraoperative ventilatory management may cause further complications by exacerbating the local intrapulmonary inflammation and amplifying the surgery induced inflammatory response [8] . Potential advantages and some disadvantages of intraoperative LPV during abdominal surgery are well-known, however, the exact role and impact of inappropriate mechanical ventilation caused inflammatory response, on systemic and local intrapulmonary complications remained uncertain. As radical cystectomy and urinary diversion is considered a high-risk, major abdominal surgery with an operating time lasting for several hours, we hypothesized that it has some rationale that optimizing intraoperative mechanical ventilation applying individually appropriate PEEP levels may improve respiratory mechanics, oxygenation, attenuate the inflammatory response and decrease the incidence of complications in the postoperative period.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 335, "end": 339, "text": "[56]", "ref_id": "BIBREF55"}, {"start": 340, "end": 344, "text": "[57]", "ref_id": "BIBREF56"}, {"start": 345, "end": 349, "text": "[58]", "ref_id": "BIBREF57"}, {"start": 350, "end": 354, "text": "[59]", "ref_id": "BIBREF58"}, {"start": 662, "end": 666, "text": "[51]", "ref_id": "BIBREF50"}, {"start": 669, "end": 673, "text": "[60]", "ref_id": "BIBREF59"}, {"start": 959, "end": 963, "text": "[24,", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 964, "end": 967, "text": "25]", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 1120, "end": 1124, "text": "[61,", "ref_id": "BIBREF60"}, {"start": 1125, "end": 1128, "text": "62]", "ref_id": "BIBREF61"}, {"start": 1446, "end": 1450, "text": "[10,", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 1451, "end": 1454, "text": "11,", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 1455, "end": 1458, "text": "14,", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 1459, "end": 1462, "text": "16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 1675, "end": 1678, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Results of our current trial are similar to those reported in earlier RCTs. Intraoperative oxygenation and respiratory mechanics improved significantly with the use of an individual PEEPopt. Additionally, dead space ventilation and \u0394P were significantly lower in the SG. We could not prove any significant intergroup differences in host inflammatory response, however the daily decrease in PCT levels was more pronounced in SG. Composite outcomes were also better in SG, but results were not significant statistically. Moreover, higher PEEP values in SG resulted in higher incidence of intraoperative hypotension, significantly higher vasopressor requirements and more kidney injury in the postoperative period. A significant correlation was found between PCT values and SOFA scores. Moreover, SOFA Scores had a significant impact on postoperative ICU length of stay but not on in-hospital days.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Although, sample size was suitable for the analysis of the physiological primary endpoints our study has several limitations. Firstly, available resources restricted our possibility to recruit enough patients to investigate robust clinical outcomes such as PPCs. Therefore, multicentre studies are needed to elaborate this further. Second, we could not perform detailed haemodynamic monitoring during surgery, hence rescue fluid boluses and norepinephrine therapy were based on mean arterial pressure, central venous oxygen saturation and central venous-to-arterial carbon dioxide difference as surrogates for more appropriate measures. Finally, during the out-of-hospital follow-up period outcomes (e.g. constipation or infection) were only assessed by phone call visits. In conclusion our study confirmed the results of previous physiological trials on individualized LPV during major abdominal surgery. Although, we found significant advantages on gas exchange and pulmonary mechanics in the SG and our results have some promising details and may further improve our knowledge on the effects of optimal intraoperative ventilatory strategies applied in patients undergoing major abdominal surgery, whether these have any effect on short and long term outcomes require further investigations.",
