Patients and methods: We collected the clinical data of patients with COVID-19 admitted to our hospital, by using logistic regression analysis and AUC curves, explored the relationship between biochemical indicators and nucleic acid positive duration, the severity of COVID-19, and hospital stay respectively. Results: A total of two hundred and thirty-three patients with COVID-19 were enrolled in the study. We found patients whose nucleic acid turned negative within 14 days had lower LDH, CRP and higher ALB (P < 0.05). ROC curve results indicated that lower LDH, TP, CRP and higher ALB predicted the nucleic acid of patients turned negative within 14 days with statistical significance(P < 0.05), AST, LDH, CRP and PCT predicted the severe COVID-19 with statistical significance, and CRP predicted hospital stay >31days with statistical significance (P < 0.05). After verification, the probability of nucleic acid turning negative within 14 days in patients with low LDH (<256 U/L), CRP (<44.5 mg/L) and high ALB (>35.8 g/L) was about 4 times higher than that in patients with high LDH, CRP and low ALB (P < 0.05). Conclusions: LDH, CRP and ALB are useful prognostic marker for predicting nucleic acid turn negative within 14 days in symptomatic patients with COVID-19.",

The ROC curve results indicated that lower LDH, TP, CRP and higher ALB could predicted patients with COVID-19 whose nucleic acid would turn negative within 14 days. After verification, the probability of negative nucleic acid reversion within 14 days in patients with low LDH (<256 U/L), CRP (<44.5 mg/L) and high ALB (>35.8 g/L) was about 4 times higher than that in patients with high LDH, CRP and low ALB. Therefore, our findings suggest that the LDH, ALB and CRP are of practical value in identifying patients with COVID-19 whose nucleic acid could CRP is an acute phase protein secreted by liver cells during the inflammatory response. 14 Sun and his colleagues' study showed CRP was negatively correlated with S-IgG, while S-specific antibodies blocked the S protein's binding to hACE2, a cellular receptor that mediated SARS-COV-2 binding and entering target cells. 15 In our study, CRP was correlated with whether nucleic acid turned negative within 14 days, the severity of COVID-19, and hospital stay > 31days or not. LDH had been reported as a well-known marker of inflammation and a predictor of various types of pneumonia. [16] [17] [18] Its explanation may be that the distribution of LDH in kidney, heart, liver, lung and other tissues is significantly higher than that in blood, and the changes of LDH induced by these tissues were more obvious. 19 The research of Yuan et al showed that COVID-19 mRNA clearance ratio was significantly correlated with the decline in LDH levels. 20 Our study showed lower LDH(<256 U/L) also could identify the patients whose nucleic acid test would turn negative within 14 days. In addition, higher ALB levels (>35.8 g/L) the same function, which may be related to the nutritional status of patients, and more studies are needed to confirm it. PCT can be used as a marker for bacterial infection and may be more effective than other commonly used clinical indicators such as CRP, ESR, and WBC. [21] [22] [23] Our research showed higher PCT had relationship with the severity of COVID-19.",

Chen and his colleagues found that elevated AST levels in NSCLC patients were closely related to longer relapse-free survival and overall survival. 25 According to a report in the literature the AST can be expressed in brain, muscle, kidney and other organizations, but ALT is more considered to be liver-specific. 26 Abnormalities in liver function indicators were more common in patients with COVID-19, however, liver dysfunction may not have serious clinical consequences for patients with COVID-19. 27 Histological examination of COVID-19 revealed diffuse alveolar damage, lung cell detachment and hyaline membrane formation from lung samples, while atypical lung cell proliferation, and the aggravation of it tends to increase AST. 28 In this study, higher AST indicated heavier severity of COVID-19, but The ALT changes were not statistically significant.
