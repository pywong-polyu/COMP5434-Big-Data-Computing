It is also an opportunistic bacterial pathogen that has emerged as an important nosocomial pathogen in recent years, especially in intensive care units (ICUs) [1] . This pathogen has been found to be associated with several clinical infections, including lower respiratory tract infections, meningitis, endocarditis, urinary tract infections, skin and soft tissue infections, burn wound infection, and bacteremia [1] [2] [3] . The strains of multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (MDRAB) are defined as A. Baumannii and are resistant to 3 or more than 3 classes of antimicrobials [4] . MDRAB isolates are a growing problem and have been widely reported in recent years [5, 6] . The rapid global emergence of MDRAB has increased the threat to healthcare systems worldwide. It has been reported that continuous surveillance of the antimicrobial resistance of A. baumannii is extremely important for the selection of appropriate empirical therapies, because appropriate therapies can increase chances of patient survival [7] . Thus, in order to determine a guide for the empirical antibiotic treatment of MDRAB, the authors investigated the antimicrobial resistance patterns of MDRAB in patients in pediatric intensive care units (PICUs).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 283, "end": 286, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 537, "end": 540, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 541, "end": 544, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 545, "end": 548, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 710, "end": 713, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 799, "end": 802, "text": "[5,", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 803, "end": 805, "text": "6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1148, "end": 1151, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "The PICU of the School of Medicine, University Children's Hospital in Adiyaman, Turkey is a tertiary-level medical center with a total of 10 beds.

A few decades ago, infections caused by A. baumannii could be effectively treated with traditionally used broad-spectrum antibiotics; currently, there are no effective drugs against this pathogen, except for a small number of antibiotics.

The present results suggest that while colistin is currently a suitable option for the treatment of MDRAB, colistin resistance in authors' region may increase in coming years, in accordance with the findings of previous studies. Tigecycline is a new glycylcycline, and it is 1 of the 2 preferred drugs for the treatment of MDRAB. Although there are differences between countries, and although tigecyclines such as colistin previously had high susceptibility rates, it has experienced high resistance rates in a short time when compared to colistin.

In a study conducted in Taiwan, all 30 isolates obtained between 2010 and 2013 had detected resistance to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole [17] .
