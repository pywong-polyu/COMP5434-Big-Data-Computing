With its rapid spread, since the beginning of the outbreak in December 2019, the disease transmitted by SARS-CoV-2 has already caused over 2 million deaths to date. In this work, we propose a web solution, called Heg.IA, to optimize the diagnosis of Covid-19 through the use of artificial intelligence. Our system aims to support decision-making regarding to diagnosis of Covid-19 and to the indication of hospitalization on regular ward, semi-ICU or ICU based on decision a Random Forest architecture with 90 trees. The main idea is that healthcare professionals can insert 41 hematological parameters from common blood tests and arterial gasometry into the system. Then, Heg.IA will provide a diagnostic report. The system reached good results for both Covid-19 diagnosis and to recommend hospitalization. For the first scenario we found average results of accuracy of 92.891%\u00b10.851, kappa index of 0.858 \u00b1 0.017, sensitivity of 0.936 \u00b1 0.011, precision of 0.923 \u00b1 0.011, specificity of 0.921 \u00b1 0.012 and area under ROC of 0.984 \u00b1 0.003. As for the indication of hospitalization, we achieved excellent performance of accuracies above 99% and more than 0.99 for the other metrics in all situations. By using a computationally simple method, based on the classical decision trees, we were able to achieve high diagnosis performance. Heg.IA system may be a way to overcome the testing unavailability in the context of Covid-19.",

Thus, those such tests are nonspecific for not detecting the virus presence directly. So rapid tests might response positively to Covid-19 from samples containing other coronavirus (that cause the common cold) or flu virus WHO, 2020) . That is why the test performance depends on factors like the time from onset of illness, and the concentration of virus in specimen WHO (2020). For example, tests based on IgM/IgG antibodies realized in the first week of illness have 18.8% of sensitivity and 77.8% of specificity (Y. . However, in the second week the IgG/ IgM tests perform with 100% of sensitivity and 50% of specificity (Y. . So, when the viral charge is high, IgG/IgM tests reach high sensitivities and specificities. But in that case, the disease is in advanced levels Hoffman et al., 2020) . Because of that, the World Health Organization does not recommend the use of this kind of tests for clinical decision-making WHO (2020).",

The coronaviruses, like SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, have as functional receptor the zinc metallopeptidase angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 (ACE2), an enzyme presents in cell membranes of arteries, heart, lungs and other organs. ACE2 is implicated in heart function, hypertension and diabetes (Turner et al., 2004) . Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) can cause acute myocarditis and heart failure . According to Zheng et al. (2020) some of the coronaviruses impacts in cardiovascular system are the increase in blood pressure, and increase in troponin I (hs-cTnI) levels . Besides that, patients with Covid-19 can developed lymphopenia (low level of lymphocytes in the blood) (Fan et al., 2020; Tan et al., 2020) , leukopenia (few white blood cells). They can also have decrease in their hemoglobin levels, Absolute Lymphocyte Count (ALC) and Absolute Monocyte Count (AMC) (Fan et al., 2020) . Patients that developed severe forms of the disease have significantly higher levels of hematological characteristics as Interleukin-6, Ddimer than patients that developed moderate form of the Covid-19 (Gao et al., 2020) . Therefore, considering that Covid-19 is a disease that affects blood parameters, hematological tests can be used to diagnosis the disease.",

This system uses blood tests to diagnose Covid-19. Our machine learning method were training using the database provided by Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein located in S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil. The database is formed by information from 5644 patients. Among them, 559 patients were diagnosis with Covid-19 by RT-PCR with DNA sequencing and identification and additional laboratory tests during a visit to the hospital (Kaggle, 2020) . For each patient the database has more than one hundred laboratory tests like blood counts and urine test. From this database we set a new one that contains only 41 blood tests recommended by the Brazilian Ministry of Health when dealing with Covid-19 patients. Our goal is to provide a web tool that perform accurate Covid-19 diagnosis with friendly interface and low computational cost.",

(2020) analyzed hematological parameters of 69 patients with Covid-19. The study was conducted with subjects from the National Center for Infectious Diseases (NCID) in Singapore. Among the patients, 65 of them underwent complete blood count (CBC) on the day of admission, and 13.4% of patients needed intensive care unit (ICU) care, especially the elderly. During the first exams, 19 patients had leukopenia (few white blood cells) and 24 had lymphopenia (low level of lymphocytes in the blood), with 5 cases classified as severe (Absolute Lymphocyte Count (ALC) < 0.5 \u00c2 10 9 /L). The study also pointed out that patients who needed to be admitted to the ICU had lower ALC and a higher rate of Lactate Dehydrogenase (LDH). These data indicated that monitoring these parameters can help to identify patients who need assistance in the ICU. The authors found out that the patients who were in the ICU had a significant decrease in their hemoglobin levels, ALC and Absolute Monocyte Count (AMC) levels, when compared to the non-ICU group. ICU patients also tend to neutrophilia. The platelet count did not prove to be a factor for discrimination between the type of hospitalization.",

In the case of patients who died, blood tests were continuously monitored throughout the treatment process. Similar to the previous study, the authors observed lymphopenia in this group. Based on this, the study then outlined a model (Time-LYM% model, TLM) for classifying disease severity and predicting prognosis. Thus, the blood lymphocyte percentage (LYM%) was divided into two cases, considering the first 10-12 days of symptoms: LYM% > 20% are classified as moderate cases and with a high chance of recovery. LYM% < 20% are classified as severe cases. In a second exam, 17-18 days after the first symptoms, patients with LYM% > 20% are recovering, patients with 5 < LYM% < 20% are in danger, and LYM% < 5% are in critical condition. In order to validate the model, the authors evaluated 90 patients with Covid-19. The consistency between Guideline and TLM-based disease classification was verified using kappa statistic (Kappa \u00bc 0.48). These results indicate that probably LYM% should be used together with other parameters for a better evaluation of Covid-19.",

As classification methods, the authors tested classic approaches, such as Support Vector Machines, Naive Bayes and Random Forest. The simulations were repeated 10 times using 10-fold cross validation. Finally, the models SBA-HEM181 and SBA-HEM061 reached an accuracy of 57% considering all the diseases chosen.

(2020c) proposed a new technique for representing DNA sequences to optimize the molecular diagnosis of Covid-19. Their method divides the DNA sequences into smaller sequences with overlap in a pseudo-convolutional approach, and represented by cooccurrence matrices. The DNA sequences are obtained by the RT-PCR method, eliminating sequence alignment. Through this approach, it is possible to identify virus sequences from a large database by using AI tools to improve both specificity and sensitivity. The group conducted experiments with 347,363 virus DNA sequences from 24 virus families and SARS-CoV-2. They used three different scenarios to diagnose SARS-CoV-2. In the first scenario the authors used all 24 families and SARS-CoV2. They achieved 0.822222 \u00b1 0.05613 for sensitivity and 0.99974 \u00b1 0.00001 for specificity when using Random Forests with 100 trees and 30% overlap. For the second scenario they aimed to compare SARS-CoV-2 with similar-symptoms virus families. In this condition, MLP classifier with 30% overlap performed better, showing sensitivity of 0.97059 \u00b1 0.03387 and specificity of 0.99187 \u00b1 0.00046. Finally, in the third scenario, they tested the real test scenario, in which SARS-CoV-2 is compared to Coronaviridae and healthy human DNA sequences. For this last condition they found 0.98824 \u00b1 0.01198 for sensitivity and 0.99860 \u00b1 0.00020 for specificity with MLP and 50% overlap.",

In this work, we proposed an intelligent system able to differentiate Covid-19 from viral and bacterial pneumonia in X-ray images, with low computational cost. There are many advantages of using X-rays images in Covid-19 diagnosis process: it is a widely available technique, with low cost, and fast delivery time. In this work, we tested Haralick and Zernike moments for feature extraction. After representing these images, we conducted experiments with several classical classifiers. Among the tested configurations, we found that Support Vector Machines overcame the other methods, reaching an average accuracy of 89.78%, average recall and sensitivity of 0.8979, and average precision and specificity of 0.8985 and 0.9963, respectively.",

Perceptron is the simplest model of a neural network, being able to deal with linearly separable problems. Multilayer Perceptron networks, on the other hand, have several interconnected neurons (or nodes), arranged in layers: the input layer, the hidden layers and the output layer. The input layer only has the network input vector, which is passed on to the next layer. Then, each node in the next layer modifies these input values through non-linear activation functions, generating output signals. In addition, the network nodes are connected by weights, which scales these output signals. Finally, the superposition of several non-linear functions allows the mapping of the input vector to the output vector. As MLPs can have one or multiple hidden layers, this process can be repeated several times, depending on the selected architecture (V. A. F.

Thus, when analyzing the data with these tests, the decision trees will guide to a certain class in classification problems, or to a continuous value, in cases of regression problems. In this way, a decision tree is built with certain questions, called nodes. Essentially, there are four types of nodes: root, parent, child, and leaf. Starting at the root node, an instance is classified. Then, the outcome for this instance is determined as the process continues through the tree. In addition, one node may connect to another, establishing a parent-child relationship, in which a parent node generates a child node. Finally, the terminal nodes of the tree are the leaf nodes, and they represent the final decision, that is, the predicted class or value. There are several types of decision trees, depending on the tree structure. The most popular ones are Random Tree and Random Forest. Both of them were tested in this study by using multiple parameters (Kotsiantis, 2013; Podgorelec et al., 2002) . Random Tree uses a tree built by a stochastic process. This method considers only a few randomly selected features in each node of the tree Geurts et al. (2006) . In contrast, Random Forest is a model made up of many decision trees. In this case, a set of trees are built and their votes are combined to classify an instance, by means of the majority vote. Each decision tree uses a subset of attributes randomly selected from the original set of attributes Breiman (2001) . ",

They are the rate of true positives, and indicate the classifier ability to detect correctly people with Covid-19. However, they are commonly used in different contexts. In machine learning context, the term Recall is common. However, in the medical world, the use of the sensitivity metric is more frequent. Precision, on the other hand, is the fraction of the positive predictions that are actually positive. Specificity is the capacity of classifying healthy patients as negatives. It is the rate of true negatives. The Kappa index is a very good measure that can handle very well both multiclass and imbalanced class problems, as the one proposed here.",
