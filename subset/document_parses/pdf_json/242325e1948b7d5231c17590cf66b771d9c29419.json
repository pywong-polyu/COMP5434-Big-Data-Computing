To understand the continuing spread of the virus, to detect those who are and were infected, and to follow the immune response longitudinally, reliable and robust assays for SARS-CoV-2 detection and immunological monitoring are needed. We quantified IgM, IgG, and IgA antibodies recognizing the SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD) or the Spike (S) protein over a period of 6 months following COVID-19 onset. We report the detailed setup to monitor the humoral immune response from over 300 COVID-19 hospital patients and healthcare workers, 2500 University staff, and 198 post-COVID-19 volunteers. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses follow a classic pattern with a rapid increase within the first three weeks after symptoms. Although titres reduce subsequently, the ability to detect anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies remained robust with confirmed neutralization activity for up to 6 months in a large proportion of previously virus-positive screened subjects. Our work provides detailed information for the assays used, facilitating further and longitudinal analysis of protective immunity to SARS-CoV-2. Importantly, it highlights a continued level of circulating neutralising antibodies in most people with confirmed SARS-CoV-2.",

Yet, a large amount of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients remains asymptomatic. SARS-CoV-2 rapidly spread around the world and was declared a global pandemic in March 2020. It remains a continuing threat to health and socio-economic well-being. Despite the global number of infections reaching tens of millions, including almost one million fatalities, due to mitigation measures, the overall infection rate is relatively low with local infection hotspots. Although scientific progress is rapid, there remains a pressing need to understand the immune response that follows SARS-CoV-2 infection, including its role during disease and especially its potential long-term protective effects.",

This was implemented early during the outbreak, with the University of Lisbon closing after March 13th, 10 days after the first recorded cases in Portugal. However, during the subsequent transition phase, restrictions have steadily been lifted. The gradual return to social and economic activity requires active surveillance to determine local outbreaks, contact tracing, and quarantine. In addition, those most vulnerable to COVID-19 will need to remain under enhanced protection. Important information is how protective immunity develops in the population at large and in specific groups such as healthcare professionals. A thorough assessment of the duration of protective immunity is critical to determine the measures that need to be taken to prevent and handle future waves of SARS-CoV-2. Such information will need to be gathered widely, in different locations around the world, reflecting local conditions, such as containment measures and their timing. The data obtained will need to be accurate and the methods used transparent and reproducible to enable comparisons between locations and countries. The recent SARS-CoV-2 outbreak brings limitations with respect to exposure time but also gives us the opportunity to acquire real-time data and develop reliable longitudinal follow-up studies.",

Depending on the aims of the study, the setup of such assays can be used for the detection of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 as well as gaining insights into neutralization activity, since antibody titers for both the S protein and RBD have been shown to correlate well with neutralizing activity [3, [9] [10] [11] . We describe the detailed setup and versatility of a seroconversion assay to determine humoral immunity to SARS-CoV-2 that was used for screening hospital patients, healthy post-COVID-19 volunteers, and staff of the University of Lisbon. We report that in the acute phase men produce more antibodies than women do, but levels equilibrate during the resolution phase and are similar between the sexes in the months after SARS-CoV-2 infection. We show that antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 Spike and its RBD domain are readily detectable in the majority of cases, including in patients receiving immune suppressive or anti-retroviral therapy. In line with a classic immune response, SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in the blood peak around week 3 post-infection, and although antibody titers reduce, IgG antibodies remain detectable and show virus neutralization activity for at least 6 months post-SARS-CoV-2 infection.",

Coated plates were stable for a week and incubation of 1 or 2 h at room temperature or 37\u00b0C was indistinguishable. To ensure that the ELISAs runs at non-saturating conditions, we performed a full titration of the capture antigens (from 0.125 to 10 \u03bcg/mL) and the secondary antibodies (1:5000-1:100 000) used for antibody detection. SARS-CoV-2 proteins were titrated and assessed using individual patient sera (high, medium, and low titers). Simultaneously, the secondary antibodies were titrated, such as anti-IgG, but also anti-IgM, anti-IgA, and anti-total Ig, whereby OD of 2.0 was used as an upper limit to avoid saturation of the assay ( In order to prepare for diagnostic use, the generation of quality control (QC) serum is critical to validate each assay run. Sera from exposed patients is most desirable as it will contain antibodies with a range of avidities and isotypes, providing more stable binding properties. However, sufficient volume needs to be obtained to ensure that there is enough material to complete the ELISA validation process and the study or series of studies to be undertaken. Sera from four SARS-CoV-2 exposed but healthy volunteers were assessed and pooled to serve as quality control for subsequent assays (Fig. 1F) . Ultimately, antibody signals should diminish in a dose-dependent way using serial dilutions of the sera, enabling the accurate determination of antibody titers (Supporting Information Fig. S1H ).",

From those who did not seroconvert within week 2 of COVID-19 symptoms (11/41, 27%), some had underlying conditions, such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) (1), lymphoma (1), chemotherapy (1), or immunosuppressive medication (3).

Of these, 20 of 40 (50%) patients showed seroconversion for anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG ( Figure 3E ). Since no symptoms were reported, it remained unclear at what stage of the infection these patients were. Those who were IgG negative may have been within the first days of infection, or antibody levels were very low. However, repeated sampling from several patients seven days later revealed that only 3/11 (27%) patients seroconverted, although OD remained modest, while in six of 11 (55%) anti-SARS-CoV-2 RBD IgG levels remained below the assay\u00b4s cutoff ( Figure 3F ).

Since the initial outbreak, reported infection levels in Portugal have remained modest compared with nearby European countries, with 5200 cases per million of the population reported (Johns Hopkins, Worldometer, August 2020). To determine the seroprevalence in University staff, we screened 2571 employees, across all divisions, with serum obtained between May 13 and July 10, 2020. As mentioned, our assay is based on Stadlbauer et al. [12] that received emergency FDA approval utilizing a two-step method. With the expectation of a low infection prevalence, we first screened staff in a single dilution using the setup as depicted in Figure 5A . We detected 68 samples with an OD above the cut off value of 0.41 (2.6%) (Fig. 5B) . These samples were subsequently reassessed, using both RBD and Spike protein as well as two serum dilutions, 1/50 and 1/150, as depicted in Figure 5C . Of the 68 tested samples, 38 (56%) were confirmed positive during the second assay ( Fig. 5D and E) , resulting in an infection prevalence of 1.5%. Samples with an intermediate signal for RBD, often just above the cutoff, frequently failed the second assay on Spike or even RBD (Fig. 5E and F) and some samples with a robust RBD signal did not respond to Spike protein at all. As previously observed (Fig. 2) , signals between RBD and Spike protein were often comparable, with only a few samples showing a stronger response against Spike. Samples providing a robust signal for RBD often responded similarly with Spike (Fig. 5G) . To ensure ODs between plates are comparable, the assays inter-plate variation was determined using two dilutions of a QC serum sample or monoclonal antibody (QC hi and QC lo ) run in each plate. Although day-to-day plate variability is present, this is of very modest amplitude (Fig. 5H) . The average and SD of QC hi OD values for the first 12 plates performed were calculated and taken into consideration to validate the following diagnostic plates. The same was done for QC lo values.",

From the second month after disease onset IgG and IgA antibody levels remained readily detectable in most people up to 6 months after first symptoms (Fig. 6A-C; Supporting Information Fig.  S3G ). Characteristically for antibody response, IgM titers were low (\u22641/200) in 130 of 182 (72%) of IgG-positive potential plasma donors (Fig. 6A-C) . Geometric means of IgM, IgG, and IgA titers at days 91-120 were 96, 533, and 141, respectively. Early anti-SARS-CoV-2 RBD antibody levels (day 40) were higher in men, with significantly higher titers for all three antibody isotypes, but at late time points (Day 40-150) no differences between men and women were observed ( Figure 6D-I) . The increased antibody level observed in men was not explained by the severity of COVID-19, with the overall increase in antibodies observed independently of disease symptoms (Supporting Information Fig. S3H) . Furthermore, stratifying subjects within the first 40 days after COVID-19 by the severity of symptoms highlighted that increased severity correlates well with increased antibody titers at early stages (Fig. 6J-L) .",

Although the reported presence of SARS-CoV-2 is limited in blood [17] , the inactivation of serum contributes to reduced risk handling human material. Using the whole RBD fraction from mammalian expression systems will reduce costs due to its superior yield. The higher levels of expression using the relatively small RBD, compared with the full-length Spike protein, makes the use of RBD more economical. We show that individual samples can show differences in signal for either RBD or Spike and that some limited cross-reactivity is observed with both proteins. However, there is no disadvantage using RBD compared with the full-length Spike protein, resulting in high specificity and sensitivity. Care should be taken when using serum samples from patients with increased antibody levels. These can be observed in allergies and autoimmune conditions, which may increase the background signal compared with otherwise healthy controls. Most subjects who encountered SARS-CoV-2 seroconverted, although some showed delayed kinetics. Only a few patients did not show an IgG response that was not explained by early sampling (<day 7) or an underlying condition that required the use of immunosuppressive drugs. Most of the non-responders were asymptomatic, which may point to a very modest immune response upon encountering a low viral load, or, since SARS-CoV-2 PCRs also generate false-positives, these participants may not have been infected.",

Our data show the successful management of the eleven patients previously infected with HIV, with all of those patients showing a robust SARS-CoV-2 antibody response after the second week of COVID-19 symptoms, in line with previous works [18, 19] . The use of immunomodulatory drugs had an inhibitory effect on SARS-CoV-2 seroconversion. This is in line with the action mechanism of these drugs, inhibiting the activation or production of lymphocytes. Although this will inhibit the clearance of SARS-CoV-2, the use of these immune-inhibitory drugs such as Dexamethasone could be beneficial in cases of severe immune response against SARS-CoV-2, resulting in cytokine storm and immunopathology [20] .",

We show that the initial antibody response against SARS-CoV-2 raises the three main isotypes in close concert as previously reported for SARS as well as SARS-CoV-2 [15, 30] . The kinetics of the response follows a well-known pattern with antibody levels peaking around 3 weeks after symptoms and declining thereafter. Late responses are characterized by low or sometimes undetecTable levels of IgM, modest IgA, but at least until 199 days post-PCR-positive reaction, mostly a robust IgG response. Between days 40 and 199, we found 90% of previous SARS-CoV-2-PCR-positive subjects (198/221), healthcare workers, and potential plasma donors, to carry antibodies, 75% of which had medium to high titers (>300). In addition, we found that in subjects with detectable anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG, neutralization activity was in accordance with the determined IgG titer level. This is in agreement with a recent report [16] . This and the strong correlation between RBD IgG titers and neutralizing activity as well as protective immunity [16, 31] , suggests that most people infected with SARS-CoV-2 will have circulating protective immunity for many months after COVID-19. In addition, recent reports of T cell responsiveness [32] [33] [34] [35] show a robust T cell response. Since the SARS-CoV-2 response is in line with well-known and detailed studied immune responses resulting in lymphocyte memory, it is very likely that SARS-CoV-2 protective immunity, reducing disease severity, will last for at least a few years.",

Coated plates were washed with PBS-0.05%Tween (PBS-T) using a Well-wash 1x8 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) or Aquamax200, 3\u00d7 for IgG detection, and 10\u00d7 for IgM analysis. Plates were blocked with 200 \u03bcl/well of 3% non-fat milk powder in PBS-1%T for 1 h at room temperature and then washed with PBS-T 3\u00d7 or 10\u00d7, as described previously. Serum samples were diluted in PBS-0.1%T + 1% nonfat milk powder, added (100 \u03bcl/well) and incubated for 1-2 h at room temperature, washed with PBS-T 3\u00d7 or 10\u00d7. Hereafter several antibody isotypes, namely Total Ig, IgG, IgM, and IgA anti-SARS-CoV2 were detected using HRP-labeled goat anti-human IgG+IgM+IgA (Abcam, ab102420), IgG Fc (Abcam, ab97225), IgM mu chain (Abcam, ab97205), IgA alpha chain (Abcam, ab97215), respectively. Secondary antibodies were diluted in PBS-0.1%T + 1% non-fat milk powder (50 \u03bcl/well) and added for 1 h at room temperature, washed with PBS-T 3\u00d7 or 10\u00d7, and developed with TMB substrate solution (TMB Substrate Reagent Set, BD OptEIA TM , 555214), 100 \u03bcl/well for 10 min. The reaction was stopped with 1M sulphuric acid (50 \u03bcl/well) and OD at 450nm was measured via Infinite M200 (TECAN) plate reader. Each plate contained a Quality control (QC) sample, composed of a pool of positive samples or monoclonal antibody, tested in a high and low dilution. For material details, see Methods supplement.",

SARS-CoV-2pp and serial dilutions of sera ( 1/10 in DMEM with 10% FBS, and further twofold dilutions) were incubated at room temperature for 30 min. Media from Vero cells was substituted with the SARS-CoV-2pp/serum mix; plates were spinoculated by centrifugation at 1250 rpm for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. After overnight incubation at 37\u00b0C, culture medium was removed, and Renilla luciferase production was assessed on Tecan 2 plate reader using the Dual-luciferase Reporter Assay system (Promega), according to manufacturer instructions.

Briefly, Spike or RBD antigen containing His-tag is produced by transient transfection of Expi293F TM cells (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with plasmids suitable for mammalian cell expression (pCAGGS), harboring Spike gene or RBD gene, respectively. All purification steps were performed at 4\u00b0C. At 3 days post-transfection, cultures are centrifuged and supernatants are collected and filtered through Sartopore MidiCaps. The clarified supernatants are concentrated and dialyzed with binding buffer by tangential flow filtration, using 10 kDa or 30 kDa membranes, for RBD or Spike purification, respectively. The final dialyzed and concentrated sample is filtered through a 0.22 \u03bcm membrane and loaded into His-Trap HP columns, equilibrated with binding buffer. Proteins are eluted with a linear gradient up to 500 mM Imidazole. The fractions containing Spike or RBD are concentrated to 1-2 mg/ml using Vivaflow 200 crossflow devices. Removal of imidazole and exchange to PBS buffer is performed by diafiltration with 10 volumes of PBS. Protein concentration is determined by A280nm combined with the specific extinction coefficient. The concentrated and formulated products are filtered through 0.22 \u03bcm membrane, aliquoted, snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80\u00b0C.Upon informed consent, blood was taken by vein puncture and two BD Vacutainer CPT tubes of blood and one serum tube were collected per patient. For serum collection, tubes were centrifuged at 2200 rpm, 10 min at 4 o C, and upper 6 \u00d7 0.25 ml of serum placed into six cryotubes. Samples are stored in a temperature-controlled -80 o C ultra-low freezer at the iMM Biobank until analysis.Serum samples were obtained from the iMM biobank COVID-19 collection and pre-pandemic control sera from two allergy collections. Patients were recruited from the COVID-19 unit and the Immunoallergology Department of Hospital de Santa Maria, Centro Hospitalar Lisboa Norte. The COVID-19 collection and scientific use were approved by the Lisbon Academic Medical Center Ethics Committee (Ref. no. 155/20) as was the staff screening (Ref. no. 181",
