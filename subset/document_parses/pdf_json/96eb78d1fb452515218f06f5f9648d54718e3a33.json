Distancing directives are represented by rates of flow into these compartments, as well as by a reduction in contacts that lessens disease transmission. The dynamical behavior of this system is analyzed, under various different rate control strategies, and the sensitivity of the basic reproduction number to various parameters is studied. One of the striking features of this model is the existence of a critical implementation delay (CID) in issuing distancing mandates: while a delay of about two weeks does not have an appreciable effect on the peak number of infections, issuing mandates even slightly after this critical time results in a far greater incidence of infection. Thus, there is a nontrivial but tight ''window of opportunity\" for commencing social distancing in order to meet the capacity of healthcare resources. However, if one wants to also delay the timing of peak infections -so as to take advantage of potential new therapies and vaccines -action must be taken much faster than the CID. Different relaxation strategies are also simulated, with surprising results. Periodic relaxation policies suggest a schedule which may significantly inhibit peak infective load, but that this schedule is very sensitive to parameter values and the schedule's frequency. Furthermore, we considered the impact of steadily reducing social distancing measures over time. We find that a too-sudden reopening of society may negate the progress achieved under initial distancing guidelines, but the negative effects can be mitigated if the relaxation strategy is carefully designed.",

Indeed, key to our model are parameters that reflect the rate at which individuals become ''socially distant\" and the rate at which individuals return to the ''non-distanced\" category.

We call this latter reduction in transmission the contact rescaling factor (CoRF). One can interpret the CoRF value as reflecting the effectiveness of social distancing. This number is a function of the stringency of rules (stay at home except for essential shopping and emergencies, wash hands frequently, wear masks, stay 6 ft. apart, etc.). Some authors consider tuning what we call the CoRF as the control ''knob\" used by authorities, (e.g. Giordano et al., 2020; Casella, 2020; Di Lauro et al., 2020; Morris et al., 2020; Bin et al., 2020) . Our focus is, instead, on rate control, which has not been sufficiently explored. Indeed, the objective of our model is to make it possible to formally consider rate control.

While it is easy to interpret this as a hopeless situation, what this actually says is that an initially headline-grabbing infection will begin to move through the population.

We find that if asymptomatics are not very contagious, and if infected individuals automatically self-isolate, then R 0 is not greatly influenced by social distancing measures. However, if asymptomatics are sufficiently infective, there is a much stronger impact of social distancing on R 0 . That said, this conclusion depends on the assumption that social distancing reduces the transmission rate of the disease by the value of the CoRF. Therefore, varying this parameter allows us to quantify how the nature of social distancing measures impacts R 0 . If this parameter is very small, meaning one significantly down-scales their contacts (that is, the stay-at-home directives are extreme and mask compliance outside the home is high), very rapid implementation of social distancing is not required. On the other hand, if the directives are not as severe and CoRF is larger (meaning the number of contacts is scaled down less significantly and/or masking compliance is low), social distancing will not result in R 0 < 1 and we can still expect disease spread despite social distancing.",

One of the most striking predictions is that a moderate delay in establishing social distancing guidelines, which we term a critical implementation delay (CID), does not appreciably increase the peak number of infected individuals. Keeping this number low (''flattening the curve\") is desirable in order to prevent strain on health providers and hospital resources. The existence of a CID means that authorities can take some time to plan for guidelines and announce a closure plan. Another important feature of the CID is that even a few days delay in implementation beyond the CID can have highly adverse consequences. Once passed, there will be many more (over ten times) the number of sick people in the population at its worst moment. With our parameters, at the start of the epidemic, the CID is roughly two weeks.",

We find that implementing even faster than the CID time results in a major postponement of the peak time for infections. For example, a delay of 15 days has a peak of infection early on in the epidemic, occurring at about 50 days. However, initiating 10 days earlier delays the peak to almost one year, a huge difference in timing. Such a postponement provides more opportunities to develop vaccines and treatments, and hence can be seen as highly desirable. On the other hand, a slower implementation allows time for planning, communicating with the public, and building up community buy-in to distancing measures.",

For example, businesses may be allowed to operate normally for one week, while the ensuing week is restricted to remote operation (or being fully closed, if remote work is not feasible). This two week ''periodic\" schedule is then continued either for a fixed period of time, or indefinitely (e.g. the discovery of a vaccine, evidence that sufficient herd immunity has been obtained, etc.) Using our model with estimated parameters, we simulate such schedules for a variety of periods, ranging from days to months of sanctioned activity. Our results are quite counter-intuitive, and suggest that there might be a pulsing period that significantly inhibits the infection dynamics (a 17 day ''on/off\" schedule with our parameters). However, this schedule is exceptionally sensitive to parameter values and timing, so that extreme caution must be taken when designing guidelines that fully relax social distancing, even temporarily. Furthermore, for some strategies near the optimal 17-day cycle, a subsequent increase in infected individuals may occur after an initial flattening.

We numerically investigate how the rate of easing social distancing guidelines affects outbreak dynamics, and show that relaxing too quickly will only delay, but not suppress, the peak magnitude of symptomatic individuals. However, a more gradual relaxation schedule will both delay onset and ''flatten the curve,\" while producing a largely immune population after a fixed policy window (again, assuming recovery corresponds to immunity, which is still an open question as of this writing). Hence the rate of relaxation is an important factor in mitigating the severity of the current pandemic. Similarly, the rate of relaxation during flattening is important to prevent a ''second wave\" of infected individuals. As governments develop and implement plans to ease social distancing, carefully considering the rate of relaxation is extremely important from a policy perspective, so that countries and states do not undo the benefits of their strict distancing policies by lifting guidelines too rapidly. For example, in our model, a very rapid relaxation schedule results in a second wave with a larger peak symptomatic proportion than originally experienced (over 27%, compared to original peak of 3:2%). However, relaxing more gradually once the peak has been obtained prevents a second outbreak, and allows a sustainable approach to herd immunity.",

Current estimates also suggest that a person with COVID-19 may be contagious 2-3 days before starting to experience symptoms (Harvard Medical School, 2020) . This makes the amount of time one would remain infected, but not able to infect others, between 1 and 3 days, on average.

That said, it is known that for other types of coronaviruses, such as the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), antibodies are maintained for an average of two years (Mo et al., 2006; Wu et al., 2007; Cao et al., 2007) . At present, pharmaceutical companies around the world are working to develop a vaccine for COVID-19, and it is hoped that one will be widely deployed in 2021. For this reason, we are currently interested in understanding the dynamics that will occur during the waiting period for a vaccine. It seems reasonable then, under the assumption that a recovered individual will acquire immunity for an average period of two years, to start by studying the simplified model where immunity is not temporary. Further, given the widespread understanding of the contagious nature of SARS-CoV-2, it is also reasonable to assume that symptomatic individuals respect social distancing guidelines.",

In other words, the infection does not take hold in the population. Mathematically, this means that the linearization at any of the DFSS's is described by a matrix in which all eigenvalues corresponding to the infective compartments have negative real part. Conversely, if the DFSS is unstable, then the infection will initially expand exponentially. It is important to realize, however, a very subtle and often misunderstood fact. Instability of the DFSS does not necessarily imply that the infection will keep increasing forever. Linearized analysis is only local, and says nothing about behavior over long time horizons, because nonlinear effects can dominate once the system is away from the DFSS; indeed, we will show that we find this phenomenon in our model (provided that social distancing directives are introduced).",

Herein we assume all recovered have developed immunity, though that assumption could easily be removed. One can interpret R \u00c3 \u00bc 0 as the very earliest stage of the pandemic, when there are no recovered individuals in the population. Because we are assuming all recovereds stay recovered, increasing values of R \u00c3 correspond to later stages of the epidemic, as long as the current number of infected individuals is small compared to the total number of susceptibles. Hence we can think of R \u00c3 as measuring the response of a susceptible population with a certain degree of immunity ''built in,\" which will naturally occur as time progresses in any pandemic.

The contact rescaling factor CoRF is kept constant, as explained in the Introduction. While it is easy to interpret this as saying controlling the disease is hopeless unless society could act unrealistically quickly, this is not the case. As discussed above, instability of the DFSS does not characterize global temporal behavior. It does tell us that an ''overshoot\" and headlinegrabbing infection will initially take hold. Thus, social distancing directives will initially appear to have failed in their intended effect. But, as time goes on and individuals limit their contacts and more individuals recover, social distancing can eventually result in R 0 < 1, which would result in the epidemic dying out exponentially.",

In any event, even though it is based on linearization, we found out that analysis based on R 0 is in excellent agreement with simulations, and hence we use formulas for R 0 as a function of R \u00c3 (and of other parameters in the model as well) to understand how sensitive R 0 is to different social distancing rates, the point in time when such directives are introduced (as quantified by R \u00c3 ), and other parameters.

Yet another data set out of Italy suggested f may be closer to 0.57 (Lavezzo et al., 2020) . Without any social distancing directives, this reduction in f would reduce R 0 from 5.6 to 5.3 at our baseline parameters. While these changes are not drastic, we do note that R 0 is more sensitive to f as h 2 increases, as can be seen in Fig. 5 by observing the increasing steepness of the contours as h 2 increases.

In Fig. 6 , we explore how the contagion level of the asymptomatics influences R 0 under varying rates of social distancing. We observe that if asymptomatics are not very contagious (b A is small), then R 0 is not very sensitive to social distancing directives as measured by h 2 (R 0 -clines are almost vertical). This can be explained by our assumption that symptomatic individuals are assumed to socially distance themselves, and therefore have minimal interaction in our model with susceptibles. When this is the case, the disease is mainly spread by non-socially distanced asymptomatics. And, if the transmission rate from these individuals is small, socially distancing the asymptomatics and susceptibles has little impact on the progression of the disease. If, on the other hand, b A is sufficiently large, then asymptomatics can fairly readily spread the disease, and we see a much stronger impact of social distancing on R 0 (R 0 -clines get much less steep as b A increases).",

This can be observed by noticing that the response to a delay of 25 days is nearly identical to one with no distancing imposed. This is hardly surprising, since if a society waits too long to start socially distancing, the disease will have already spread through much of the population. However, if the delay is short enough (i.e. the response quick enough), we see a significant reduction in the peak of the infected population (3% at the peak for a t c \u00bc 5 days, compared to the worst-case of 40%). Furthermore, there seems to be a critical ''window of opportunity\" for commencing social distancing: the difference between waiting 15 and 20 days is quite striking (peak of 7% in the former, up to 30% in the latter).",

We investigate this further by plotting both the peak symptomatic population and the time to this peak in Fig. 11 , where social distancing is begun at t \u00bc t c days, for t c \u00bc 0; 1; 2; . . . ; 35. This provides a quantification of what we saw in Fig. 10 : if the delay is relatively small or large, the response (measured as peak infected percentage) is robust to the delay. However, there is a critical window about which a ''bifurcation\" occurs. For our parameters, the bifurcation value appears to be approximately 2 weeks. In those first two weeks, if social distancing is begun, the outbreak will be sharply inhibited. However, near this critical value, delaying even a few extra days could drastically increase the total number of symptomatic individuals. For example, waiting 17 days yields a peak of 14% symptomatic, while waiting an extra week increases the peak to over 35%. Thus we see that policies will be effective in a certain window, and that it is critical to implement them within that window. Indeed, delaying even by a few days outside of that window could severely increase the total number of infections.",

This is intuitive, and combined with the previous result says that the more quickly social distancing is enacted, the longer you will have to deal with a smaller number of sick individuals. However, the number of sick individuals is relatively constant up until a certain time delay, where once passed, there will be many more (over ten times) the number of sick people in the population at its worst moment. Hence, on the policy level, if the existence of the infection is known sufficiently early, it is okay to take some time to plan a strategy, but once decided, it must be implemented quickly and efficiently. On the other hand, implementing even faster than the CID time results in the peak infections being postponed by a huge margin, thus giving more time for the development of vaccines and treatments. For example, a delay of 15 days has a peak infection early on in the epidemic (at about 50 days), while implementing the same distancing policy 10 days earlier delays the peak until approximately 1 year. In both cases, the peak infected populations are similar (7% compared to 3%, still both substantially smaller than the predicted 40% non-distanced dynamics), but the time scales over which the peak occurred are much different.

There is a slight discrepancy based on t f , since the schedules may end at different points of their respective cycles, but this effect is minimal.

Note that we fix h 2 \u00bc 0:5 as in Section 3.2.2. The results presented in Fig. 13 are quite surprising and nonintuitive. Note that they all have delayed the onset of the peak of the epidemic by a similar length of time (all around 45-65 days, whereas the epidemic would have originally peaked at around 30 days). However, the degree to which the peak has been suppressed is different among the relaxation schedules. It appears that high frequency pulsing (small Dt) does better than some extended strategies (compare Dt \u00bc 7 to Dt \u00bc 14; 21; 28), but worse than others (compare Dt \u00bc 7 to Dt \u00bc 17). This seems to indicate that there is some optimal pulsing period. Furthermore, the curve for Dt \u00bc 17 days is quite interesting; we see a significant reduction in peak population infection (22%, compared to 30% for Dt \u00bc 7 days, and approximately 40% for no social distancing) together with an extended ''flattening of the curve\", which does not appear in the others. We also note that all strategies end with similar recovery rates (all above 93%, top right panel, Fig. 13) .

Results indicate that gradual relaxation does have a significant effect on ''flattening the Fig. 12 . Pulsing of socially distancing protocol.

Fig. 18 further supports this claim, as we compute little variation in the peak for small relaxation times (corresponding to more quickly ending protocols), but that a substantial decrease in symptomatic burden is obtained as t e is increased. Indeed, for a gradual relaxation over a one year period (360 days), we see a peak symp-tomatic population of only 19%, which is significantly lower than the peak when immediately re-opening after 60 days (40%). Note that the latter schedule does not result in any significant peak mitigation when compared to the policy of no social distancing: it merely delays the same peak by approximately 56 days. Hence it seems crucially important to gradually relax social distancing guidelines, as gently as is economically feasible, to help mitigate the outbreak. We also see that, as in Section 3.2.3, all strategies result in a significant fraction of the surviving population being immune by t f \u00bc 360 days; the most gradual relaxation policy has the lowest immune population of just under 90%. In other words, under the assumption that infection confers immunity that lasts at least a year, herd immunity has been largely achieved in all protocols.",

After t d , we see a different infection response based upon the rate at which distancing policies are relaxed.

However, if relaxation is relatively slow (for example, t e \u00bc 800 days meaning distancing measures are gradually relaxed over 405 days), we see no second wave of infection.

Note that a second wave occurs for relaxation protocols that end too quickly (te \u00bc 400; 500; 600 days). However, if relaxation is slow enough (larger te), a second wave of infection is mitigated. All simulations are taken over 1080 days. mary focuses of study is disease response (measured by peak symptomatic proportion) to different mandated social distancing controls. Our major contributions and results are described below: 1. In model formulation, we decouple the rate of social distancing (h 2 ) with the decrease in contact due to social distancing ( S ; A ; I ). The latter we term the contact rescaling factor (CoRF), which should be interpreted as an effectiveness of social distancing. Hence we explicitly account for both the rate at which individuals distance, and how effective distancing is as a means of suppressing viral transmission. 2. The basic reproduction number, R 0 , is explicitly calculated for our model system. For parameters obtained from data, we show that when there is little immunity in the population, R 0 > 1 unless the rate of social distancing is quite large. This implies that under most realistic circumstances there will be an initial outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the situation is not hopeless, as social distancing policies are able to push R 0 < 1 as the disease spreads throughout the population. 3. R 0 is sensitive to the fraction of infective individuals that are asymptomatic, and to the infectivity of these asymptomatic individuals. Hence understanding this population (through, for example, widespread testing and contact tracing) is critical for making informed policy decisions. 4. There is a critical time to implement social distancing guidelines (what we label the critical implementation delay (CID)), after which social distancing will have little effect on mitigating the percent of symptomatics at the peak of the outbreak. Surprising, the CID occurs well before the peak symptomatic proportion would have originally appeared under non-distanced protocols (CID is approximately two weeks for our parameter values, while the non-distanced peak occurs at about 30 days).",

For example, implementing social distancing at day 5 instead of day 15 pushes the peak forward by nearly a year, which allows time for the development of therapeutics. 6. Periodic relaxation strategies, where normal behavior is allowed for certain periods of time, can significantly reduce the symptomatic burden. However, such scheduling is not robust, and small errors (either in timing, or via parameter estimation) may have catastrophic repercussions. 7. Gradual relaxation can substantially improve the overall symptomatic response, but the rate of relaxation is important to prevent a ''second wave\" of infections. Prolonged relaxation, or sufficiently slow relaxation upon flattening, can significantly ''flatten the curve.\"",

Another consideration for future modeling work is that, because all individuals transition through the asymptomatic compartment, those who go on to develop symptoms in our model have a somewhat longer infectious period than asymptomatic individuals. The inclusion of an exposed compartment could also address this feature of the model, as exposed individuals could transition to either asymptomatic or symptomatic as compared to having symptomatic individuals transition through the asymptomatic compartment. Finally, some of the assumptions in the simplified model may not be realistic in all settings, necessitating the analysis of the full model. For instance, there is growing evidence on college and university campuses of individuals not isolating despite being positive for COVID-19. While this represents a very small percent of those who test positive, it is possible that such individuals could yield a superspreader event, and therefore it could be interesting to explore the impact of the intentional non-isolation of a small percent of symptomatic individuals. As another example, the simplified model assumes that immunity lasts the duration of the time period considered in our simulations (on the order of years). It is currently not clear what the duration of immunity to SARS-CoV-2 is. While studies show that antibodies may only be detectable for two to three months after infection, antibodies are not the only form of immunity, as memory T and B cells play a major role in long term immunity (Francis Collins, 2020) .",
