Paying low attention to privacy policies, we are rarely aware of processing practices. Drawing on multidisciplinary research, we postulate that privacy policies presenting information in a way that triggers affective responses, together with individual characteristics, may influence privacy attitudes. Through an online quasi-experiment (N = 88), we investigate how affect, illustration type, personality, and privacy concerns may influence endusers' willingness to disclose information and privacy awareness. Our results partially confirm these assumptions. We found that the affect may have an impact on privacy awareness, and stable psychological factors may influence disclosures. We discuss the applicability of our findings in interface design and in future research.",

Our research objective is to identify how to improve end-users' privacy awareness at an early stage of interaction, and to advance the existing body of knowledge about privacy attitudes and behaviors.

One of simple heuristics is the affect heuristic, when people make judgments based on subjective evaluations by adding either positive or negative value to the decision outcome [12] . The affectas-information hypothesis postulates that affective states have cognitive consequences mediated by the subjective experience of affect [6] . Thus, emotions occur, and this feeling has a significant impact on cognitive processing, providing conscious information from unconscious appraisals. Such feelings can guide immediate actions and may create experiences (e.g., liking or disliking), resulting in a higher or lower evaluation of an object. Similarly, the feelings-as-information theory proposes that positive affect indicates that a given situation is safe [31] . Positive affect may serve as an incentive to rely on internal thoughts, whereas negative affect should direct attention to new external information, as it indicates whether a situation is safe. In sum, affect relates to recall, thought generation, and processing of new external information. Affective reactions may result from an external stimulus, such as the way information is presented or semantic context, in which the situation takes place.",

RQ3: Does affective framing applied in the design of privacy policies influence privacy awareness and willingness to disclose? Antecedents of Privacy-Related Decision-Making. This research builds on the APCO (Antecedents\u2192 Privacy Concerns\u2192Outcomes) framework [8] , because it has been created based on a thorough review of privacy studies from multidisciplinary fields. The APCO framework contains factors active during decision-making processes, enabling a deeper understanding of human aspects of privacy attitudes and behaviors.

Our findings are similar to the results from past research-the implementation of a cartoon-like design may increase attention [36, 37] . However, we determined that in the context of privacy, such an effect is possible only when brought by affective framing. Perhaps emotions mediate the relationship between design and privacy awareness. Our qualitative results add to such a premise, as some of the participants mentioned in emotionally loaded statements, that they comprehended privacy information because of the illustrations. These results indicate that comic designs can convey emotional meaning and improve understanding, as it has been demonstrated by Noll Webb et al. [26] .

Our participants expressed the need for more control and choice at an early-stage of interaction. Such findings align with past research, e.g., a lack of control as one of the privacy concerns, and call for \"fine-grained\" control mechanisms as shown in Sheth et al. [33] . Our participants were dissatisfied with the current designs, exhibiting desperation and indicating usability issues. Concurrently with the GDPR, this calls for granular and dynamic privacy policies. Policy designers should focus on identifying new ways, in which privacy policy could provide end-users with opt-in/opt-out functionality at the early stage of interaction. For instance, one of such solutions could allow users to entirely disconnect the newly installed application from their social network tracking, through a simple interaction method (e.g., enable/disable toggles). Yet, such functionality would have to be non-intrusive as privacy management is not a primary task during the sign-up process. Additionally, some of the past research shows that too much perceived control over disclosure might lead to increased risks to privacy [4] . Hence, the design of control mechanisms requires balanced solutions that provide controls in a simplified form, with only necessary options, perhaps only for the riskiest data processing practices.",

We interpret this relationship as the demand for personalized systems recognizing and estimating the level of individuals' privacy concerns.
