            "text": "Attending higher education commonly represents a major life transition for young people, with it often being the first time living away from the family home, which can bring social, financial and academic stressors [1, 2] . The true prevalence of mental health problems for students in higher education is hard to estimate accurately. For example, in the UK, there is a scarcity of large-scale studies being truly representative of the UK student population in higher education or applying a weighted adjustment to accommodate for the lack of representativity [3, 4] . However, the number of students in higher education disclosing mental health problems and accessing higher education institutions' (HEI) support services has risen in recent years [1] . Disclosure and requesting support can result in long waiting lists for more traditional individualised therapy sessions, while stigma around seeking help for mental health and well-being is still present [5, 6] . Therefore, a possible solution may be the provision of interventions aimed at reducing stress and anxiety as well as boosting mental health and well-being that are appealing, effective, and accessible to large groups of students [6] . In this respect, part of the solution could be Animal Assisted Interventions (AAIs).",

Furthermore, the importance, in the psychosocial model, of social support for health and how social support can function as a buffer against stress are also relevant [23, 24] . The animal-human bond can be considered as a type of social relationship, which can offer this type of support. Some individuals may form an animal-human bond more readily than a human-human bond as animals are considered to be indifferent and non-judgemental to an individual's appearance, social skills or socioeconomic status (SES) [25] . Furthermore, the Biophilia Theory proposes that humans are drawn to interact with animals due to an innate desire to connect with living organisms and nature [25, 26] . Additionally, distraction as a cognitive refocus may also contribute, though this research has mostly focused on anxiety and pain whilst awaiting or receiving medical treatment [27] .",

In the UK, these types of programmes have also risen in popularity with various forms being implemented, ranging from oneday events to specific sessions [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] . Additionally, the evidence-base for using AAIs with this population is growing with persuasive descriptive and anecdotal reports of the benefits [2, 6, 33, 34] . Over recent years, more randomised controlled trials (RCTs) have been published, evaluating the effectiveness of AAIs in respect of various outcomes for students in higher education [35] [36] [37] . Nonetheless, a lack of completed systematic reviews for AAIs and this specific population exists. Therefore, to our knowledge, no completed systematic reviews were identified that primarily evaluate the effectiveness of AAIs, particularly AAT",

AAA and AAT are often used interchangeably in the literature, leading to ambiguity [12, 49] . To overcome these identified discrepancies, both AAT and AAA were included. The definitions provided by the International Association of Human-Animal Interaction Organisations (IAHAIO) and the American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA) to classify the various types of AAI were used [7, 8] . In summary, AAT involves a specifically trained live animal in a planned, structured and goal-directed intervention, designed to improve socio-emotional, physical, behavioural and/or cognitive functioning of the individual(s) as part of the treatment process [7, 8] . AAT is delivered and/or directed by a trained human professional (from education, health or human ser- 5 of 43 vices) with specific expertise, and progress is measured/evaluated [7, 8] . AAA is a planned informal interaction with trained animal-human teams for recreational, motivational and educational opportunities [7, 8] . For the purposes of this systematic review, in accordance with IAHAIO, AAA is goal-orientated [8] . It was anticipated that studies might provide insufficient detail to objectively assess and classify the type of intervention (for example to distinguish clearly between AAT and AAA). Consequently, studies were included if the live animal was called/considered a therapy animal, a therapeutic aim/goal was identified, and the outcomes of interests were evaluated. If the term \"therapy animal\" had not been used, the authors had to explicitly mention that the animal had, at least, had introductory training and an assessment/evaluation [8, 9] . If the intervention was part of a multi-component programme, isolating the effectiveness of the AAT/AAA had to be possible; otherwise, the study was excluded. Additionally, if a study used a stressor, the stressor had to be an aspect of study, training, education or be student specific. An exam or an experimental cognitive test that was used to emulate evaluative testing are examples of included stressors.",

The remaining titles and abstracts (n = 6248) were cautiously screened for relevance, erring on over-inclusivity, by the first author (CPC) in Rayyan to remove obvious irrelevant studies or duplicated studies not identified by the automated systems [40, 61] . Subsequently, 100% of the articles that were deemed potentially relevant (n = 928), were reviewed independently by two reviewers (CPC and ML, a fellow Master's student) against the pre-specified eligibility criteria using Rayyan [61] . 132 articles were identified as requiring full manuscript review, which was undertaken in full by CPC and 20% by ML, both blinded to the other's decisions. To identify a random 20% for ML, the titles were arranged alphabetically in Endnote. Subsequently, a random number (n = 114) was generated by a true random number generator website [62] . Every fifth article (as 20%) was chosen starting from the 114th article. If any discrepancies arose at any stage, discussion occurred between the two reviewers. If consensus was not achieved, agreement was obtained by discussing with a third reviewer (EM). If the full manuscripts were not available, title/abstract/keywords were reviewed. To meet the eligibility criteria to request an inter-library loan, at least three elements of the PICOS criteria had to be fulfilled. Keywords were identified from Rayyan, Endnote and MeSH analyser [61, 63, 64] .",

Meta-analysis was not appropriate due to all studies being at high risk of bias for the outcomes of interest, with most having high or some concerns regarding missing data, alongside the substantial clinical heterogeneity. Since meta-analysis was judged to be inappropriate, a harvest plot using vote counting, based on direction of effect, was used with categorisation of the studies by their effect (detrimental, no or beneficial effect) [40] . Effect size or statistical significance were not included for this categorisation as this can be misleading [40] . Vote counting was used for both the primary and secondary outcomes using mean change score for one comparator and one time-point according to the hierarchy previously described. If the outcomes were measured immediately after the intervention, as well as, at an additional time with a stressor, the former was only included for the vote counting.

Seven studies reported the characteristics according to the recruited sample size [35, 37, 72, 73, 76, 77, 80] and three for the analysed sample size [74, 78, 79] ; one reported the characteristics of the students attending the degree programme from which the participants were recruited and not the sample's characteristics (this study is excluded from the descriptive statistics below) [75] . Ten studies reported gender with the majority (ranging from 57% to 85%) of participants being female [35, 37, [72] [73] [74] [76] [77] [78] [79] [80] . The most common age bracket was 20-year-olds and under, followed by 21 to 25-year-olds. Type of student was clearly reported in five studies [35, 73, 76, 77, 79] . Of those, 80% were undergraduates [35, 73, 76, 77] . The students' year of academic studies was fully reported in two studies [35, 74] . Five studies reported ethnicity [35, 73, 76, 77, 80] . None of the studies reported health status or socio-economic status (SES). The participants studied a range of course subjects (such as psychology and nursing). Three studies collected the potential confounder of pet ownership [37, 72, 78] , and one reported experience with the animals employed in the intervention (horses) [80] .",

Most interventions (n = 8) corresponded to the definition of AAA described in 3.3 [37, 72, 73, [75] [76] [77] [78] [79] . Two studies were classified as AAT [35, 74] and one combined AAT and AAE together [80] . These classifications were mostly from an objective assessment of the description provided vis-\u00e0-vis the definitions outlined in 3.3. If insufficient detail for an objective assessment, the classification used by the primary authors was kept [35] . Length of intervention ranged from unspecified to 90 min, with the modal length being between 10 to 20 min. Seven studies used a single session [35, 37, 72, 73, [78] [79] [80] . Four studies used multiple sessions [74] [75] [76] [77] ; of these, two used once-weekly sessions for four weeks [76, 77] ; one implemented three sessions with non-reporting of the time interval between sessions [74] ; and one allowed various lengths and frequencies over a 15 to 16-week period at the participant's choice [75] . None of the studies reported monitoring or measuring the intervention's fidelity. The theoretical frameworks were clearly stated in three studies [35, 37, 80] . More information regarding the theoretical frameworks is included in Appendix D.",

Two studies found no statistical difference [74, 77] but a power calculation was not included. Hunt et al.

Despite the differences between the two studies, both showed a statistically significant reduction in stress when measured within 24 h of the intervention. This effect was not sustained at the two-week follow-up for the one study that included longer follow-up [35] . Therefore, these studies showed cautious preliminary evidence of a short-term, statistically significant, beneficial effect on stress, using AAIs, with students at Canadian universities.

A non-statistically significant detrimental effect appeared to occur particularly when a stressor is applied. Of the two studies that showed statistically significant beneficial results without a stressor, this result had not lasted by the 4th session for one study. Where a non-statistical significance was shown, a power calculation was not included. Therefore, the studies may have been underpowered to demonstrate the true effect (which may or may not be similar to the results explored here). Further investigation is required before any conclusions can be made for this outcome. Three studies measured well-being using various tools (for example, Sense of Belonging in School, Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-being Scale (WEMWBS), Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS), Subjective Happiness Scale and Medical Outcomes Study Social Support) [35, 37, 78] . Overall, tentative but mostly beneficial effects were found in varying measures of well-being when measured immediately after or within 24 h of the AAI. Where a non-statistically significant effect was found, the outcomes were measured within 24 h of the intervention during mid-term exam season. Additionally, no power calculation had been included for the non-statistically significant findings, and therefore, distinguishing between true \"no effect\" or being underpowered was not possible.",

Furthermore, this review combined RCTs, which represent the gold standard study design for evaluating a causal relationship and for measuring an intervention's effectiveness [83] . A meta-analysis was not appropriate for reasons already described; therefore, vote counting, based on direction of effect and not statistical significance, was employed. Vote counting using statistical significance can be misleading especially in studies where no power calculation was reported and no significance was found [40] . The lack of statistically significant effect may either be due to the study being underpowered or may reflect a true lack of effect [40] . However, when using vote counting on direction of effect without considering statistical significance, the effect seen may be due to chance. Additionally, vote counting methods are unable to provide a precise estimate of the overall effect size.",

A percentage above a minimum for double screening, data extraction and risk of bias assessment was chosen due to resource and time constraints, which represents a limitation. Using the strength of evidence approach, overall weight was influenced mainly by how well the authors described randomisation and/or presence of withdrawals/missing data as all the studies were relevant RCTs where double blinding was difficult. Where not reported, concluding whether these elements simply had not occurred or had occurred but not described due to reasons (such as word-count limits) was impossible, unless clarified by the authors through correspondence.

Therefore, providing conclusions about whether certain types of AAIs were more effective that others or to isolate the \"active ingredient\" of effective AAIs was not possible. Most of the participants were females, ranging from 57% to 85%, and authors rarely commented on how well the sample population represented the target population. Furthermore, all the participants volunteered to participate and, therefore, may not be representative of the target population [84] . For example, those volunteering (and therefore, self-selecting) may be more motivated and/or have a different mental health status than those who did not [84, 85] . Additionally, individuals who are afraid, allergic or have a medical condition precluding participation with animals are unlikely to have volunteered. Therefore, building a comprehensive picture of the type of individual attending higher education, who would benefit from AAIs was challenging.

Additionally, participant expectancy bias could have been introduced, which was highlighted in Williams et al. [79] as 90% of the control group sampled (n = 15) stated they thought an interaction with the dog would have reduced their stress prior to an exam. Despite these limitations, capturing how an individual feels after an intervention/comparator is important. To aid corroboration and confidence with self-reported results, triangulation would be beneficial such as with objective measures (for example, physiological outcomes) and/or blinded behavioural observations [86] .

A formative evaluation, including both process and implementation assessments, with a mixed-methods pilot study would be a useful first step [89] [90] [91] . The feasibility, acceptability and fidelity of the AAI in the target population can therefore be assessed with adaptation, if required.

However, caution is required as these results were from studies at high risk of bias for the outcomes of interest for this systematic review with mostly medium strength evidence, and in various cultural settings. Subsequent implementation of AAIs in this setting requires both formative and summative evaluation to measure both the intended and unintended consequences. Furthermore, consideration of alternatives for students unable to participate due to fear of animals or medical contraindications is recommended to prevent widening of health inequalities.

Suggested that students who reach transcendence (highest level of comfort) \"would be empowered to rise above the challenges of nursing education\" ([75] p. 203). Stating how & why dogs could help with achieving transcendence was not explicitly included. \u2022 Hunt et al.
