Understanding the underlying reasons why women join trials and their barriers to product use can support identification of ways to improve adherence and its reporting. Eight focus group discussion workshops were conducted with 46 former microbicide trial participants in Durban, South Africa and Mwanza, Tanzania. Participants provided feedback on why women join trials, the barriers to using study gel and reporting adherence accurately, and how clinical trial design can be improved to support better adherence and its reporting. Women join microbicide trials for a number of important reasons such as healthcare and financial reimbursement. Fear of adverse effects from the investigational product was the most important reason why participants reported not using the gel. The key reason for inaccurate reporting of gel use was fear of removal from the trial. Participants made concrete suggestions for improving microbicide trial design such as applicator use testing and real time feedback, improving education to participants about how trials answer their research questions, and improving transparency and clarity about study procedures. Participants also gave feedback on an innovative trial design with a non-randomised arm. Identifying HIV prevention products for women requires better understanding of the lives of women asked to join these trials, and application of that understanding to microbicide trial design. This study has demonstrated that participants and research teams can work collaboratively to design clinical trials that meet needs of both the research and of participants.",

It is important to understand the underlying reasons behind this phenomenon. Greater understanding of the reasons for low adherence is important to support optimal design of future bio-behavioural clinical trials in low-resource settings, effective rollout of proven HIV prevention methods in communities, and to identify ways to improve adherence and its reporting in future microbicide trials. Due to the history of low adherence in microbicide trials, the HIV prevention field has shifted focus towards long acting methods such as vaginal rings and injectables for pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). However, the need for on-demand and topical HIV prevention products has been recognised by community stakeholders and researchers alike [8, 9] . Continued development of a range of HIV prevention products that can meet the varying needs of users will support optimal public health benefit for HIV prevention.",

The importance of adherence, and how low adherence can affect interpretation of trial results, was discussed using the Carraguard trial as an example. The Carraguard Trial was a phase III clinical trial of Carraguard Gel [14] [15] [16] . Overall, Carraguard participants self-reported using the gel at last sex act 96% of the time. However, participants were also asked to return their used gel applicators, which were tested for vaginal insertion using a special staining technique. Results of the stain assay indicated that participants used the gel about 44% of the time. The trial results were null. Ultimately, it was not clear if Carraguard was not biologically efficacious against HIV, or if participants didn't use it enough during the trial. During this session, participants were provided with a picture of the vaginal applicator staining technique used to differentiate vaginally inserted applicators from non-inserted applicators [15] .",

The next session addressed participant experience in the trials, and their feelings and needs. After a facilitated discussion, participants worked in groups to write down different feelings and needs of participants, and sort them into their own categories. Participants then engaged in a role play game to act as \"research staff/researchers\" and \"participants\" and discuss their respective attributes. The next facilitated discussion focused on views about who benefits from microbicide trials, the relationship dynamic between participants and research staff, and potential impacts on adherence and adherence reporting. The next session included a role play, conducted by FGDW facilitators, portraying different participants, their gel use, and how they reported their gel use to clinic staff. Participants were asked to reflect on the role plays and discuss what impacts a participant's ability to be honest, and what can be changed within the trials to support participants to accurately report their adherence. The final session of the FGDWs, called \"Design your own trial\" involved small group work. Participants were asked to reflect on the day's topics and then describe how they would design future microbicide trials to support participants to consistently use the gels and to feel comfortable to honestly report their gel use.

Transcripts were coded inductively (using NVivo10) to identify themes which emerged from the data by the principal investigator who was present at each FGDW. No coding structure was predetermined prior to analysis. The coding structure emerged and changed iteratively as meaning, in relation to the research questions, was derived from what participants said. Subthemes were added as they emerged, and structural codes were added to aid organization of the data. Negative cases, examples of views that were different than those more commonly expressed, were identified and coded when they existed. Analytic memos were used to reflect on the meaning of the quotations, differences between groups, relationships between themes, and identification of overarching themes. Codes were then adjusted and harmonised to help ensure each code described a unique concept relating to what participants said. All transcripts were coded a second time for quality assurance.",

At the same time, participants want access to a female-controlled HIV prevention product, and want microbicide trials to answer their research questions, yet may not understand how their personal adherence affects trial results.",

First, they recommended use of a simple diagram and explanation to show the link between adherence and how a trial answers its research question, empowering each participant to understand how their role in using the study gel can affect the overall outcome of the trial. This explanation needs to state explicitly that the number of women who get HIV in the placebo arm and the active arm will be compared to see if the active drug reduces HIV infection. Second, participants recommended that staff provide clear explanations about each aspect of the trial as it was happening to reduce concerns that could negatively affect product adherence.",

Drug blood levels or other biomarker testing, in contrast, cannot be reported at an individual level due to blinding. Since the Carraguard trial, more robust technologies using biomarkers are being developed that could eliminate some of the limitations of the original applicator dye-test [27, 28] .",

This trial design gives women an acceptable way to participate without having to pretend they are using gel. Women interested in using the gel would elect to do so and would be randomized to placebo or active gel. This design seeks to improve adherence in the gel arms by eliminating the dilution effect [4] caused by women who do not use the investigational gel. Participants in favour of this trial design thought it would be appropriate because women would have freedom to choose if they use the gel or not, would still benefit from the trial, would not waste gel unnecessarily, and would not prevent the research from discovering a potentially efficacious microbicide. While this design may improve adherence, it will certainly be more costly than a conventional trial, as more women will be enrolled. Microbicide effectiveness trials are expensive, with estimates of phase III trials costing up to $70 million USD [29, 30] . If multiple trials have null results due to low adherence, considerable funds are wasted and a potentially efficacious product may be eliminated from the product development pipeline. While initially expensive, investing in a trial design that could potentially meet the needs of women in high HIV incidence communities and meet the needs of the research might be a wise investment for the long-term objectives of HIV prevention research. This design may also give some indication of product acceptability in the particular population.",

This study was independent of the initial trials-this, together with the time elapsed since trial participation, may have supported participants to speak more candidly. The orientation provided to participants at the outset of the FGDWs, which included information about low adherence in microbicide trials, may have influenced how participants shared their perspectives. The focus of this study was pragmatic and oriented towards problem-solving. While this study is not representative of all microbicide trial participants, views reported here add to the body of understanding of trial experiences.

For optimal results, these underlying dynamics can be addressed in the actual design of microbicide trials. This may require thinking creatively to develop different ways of designing clinical trials. As this study has demonstrated, participants and research teams can work collaboratively to consider such designs.
