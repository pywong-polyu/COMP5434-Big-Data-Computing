            "text": "Here we describe a novel immunogenic method to detect COVID-19. The method is a chromogenic magnetic bead-based ELISA which allows inexpensive and quantitative detection of human IgG or IgM antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in serum or whole blood samples in just 12 minutes. As a proof of concept, we compared the performance of our new method to classical ELISA. Person correlation between optical densities obtained using the two methods was 0.98, the color intensity observed in the novel method correlated with antibody titers determined by classical ELISA. The novel magnetic bead-based ELISA correctly classified all 6 positive COVID-19 samples tested and showed 100% specificity as judged by the analysis of a cohort of 26 negative samples. The magnetic bead-based ELISA performed better than classic ELISA to discriminate COVID-19 positive serum with low antibody titer. The chromogenic magnetic bead-based ELISA method described here can be applied to both point of care and high throughput analysis. The method is readily adaptable to be used with other protein and peptide-based antigens.",

The pathogen in these cases has been identified, through viral isolation, electron microscopy and RNA sequencing, as a new beta-coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2 (Zhu et al. 2020) . Shortly after its emergence in China, SARS-CoV-2 spread rapidly across the world. According to the John Hopkins University website (https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html), on 18/07/2020, more than 14 million cases of COVID-19 have been registered worldwide and the disease was responsible for 600,000 deaths. So far, there is no vaccine or drug to treat the virus and/or the disease. The only effective measure is the isolation of infected subjects and social distance, which, in turn, has profound socioeconomic impacts specially in less developed countries such as Brazil.",

The shortcoming of qRT-PCR is that it is limited to track virus during the acute phase of the disease. Furthermore qRT-PCR is expensive and requires sophisticated instrumentation, well trained personnel, intensive labor and is not adaptable to point of care analysis (Petherick 2020) . This is particularly critical to countries such as Brazil where samples may need to travel long distances between patients and analytical laboratories adding additional transportation costs.

It still requires relatively expensive instrumentation, trained personnel and about a day to complete the analysis. Furthermore, ELISA is not suitable to point of care analysis.

This plasmid was named pLHSarsCoV2-N and transformed into E. coli BL21 (\u03bbDE3) enabling the expression of N-terminal His-tagged N-protein after induction with IPTG. The cells were growth in 400 ml LB medium at 120 rpm at 37 o C to OD600nm of 0.3. Then, IPTG was added to a final concentration 0.3mM and 30 min later, the incubator temperature was lowered to 16 o C. The culture was kept at 120 rpm at 16 o C over/night. Cells were collected by centrifugation at 3,000 xg for 5 min. The cell pellet was resuspended in 10 ml of buffer 1 (Tris-HCl pH 8 50mM, KCl 100 mM, imidazole 20 mM). Cells were disrupted by sonication on an ice bath. The soluble fraction was recovered after centrifugation at 20,000 xg for 10 minutes and loaded onto a 1 ml Histrap chelating Ni 2+ column (GE Healthcare), which had been previously equilibrated with buffer 1. The column was washed with 10ml of buffer 1 and bound proteins were eluted with buffer 1 containing increasing concentrations of imidazole. The His-tagged N-protein eluted at 300 mM. The fractions were pooled and desalted using a 5 ml desalting column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8, 100 mM KCl and 10% (v/v) glycerol as buffer. The final protein preparation yield was 3 mg and was homogeneous as judged by SDS-PAGE analysis (Fig. S1 ). The purified protein was stored in aliquots at 4 o C for one week or at -20 o C for up to two months. The protein identity was confirmed by peptide mass fingerprint MALDI-TOF analysis (Fig. S1 ).",

Classical ELISA was in house built using the same antigen preparations (the SARS-CoV-2 N protein) mounted on polystyrene 96 well plates. Serum from a COVID-19 positive patient (PCR-confirmed) and a negative control (collected in 2018) serum were subjected to serial dilutions and allowed to react with SARS-CoV-2 N protein on both classic ELISA and magnetic particles-based ELISA. On regular ELISA, the COVID-19 positive serum showed strong reaction with the N protein in dilution for up to 1:25,600 ( Fig. 2A) . A clearly distinguished profile was observed in the negative control serum, which showed background cross reaction only in dilutions up to 1:800 ( Fig. 2A) . When the same samples were analyzed in our magnetic bead-based ELISA, the COVID-19 positive serum showed strong reaction with the N protein antigen in dilutions for up to 1:3,200. On the other hand, the negative control serum had no detectable background cross reaction even at low dilutions (Fig. 2B) . These data show that magnetic bead-based ELISA provided quantitative data and can therefore be used to determine serum titers without background cross reactions characteristic for classic ELISA.

As a proof of concept, the performance of this novel method was compared to data obtained when the same samples were analyzed using classical ELISA. We noted that while COVID-19 negative serum showed some cross reactivity with N protein antigen using classical ELISA under low serum dilutions, such cross reaction was not detectable in the Magnetic beadbased ELISA (Fig. 2) . Hence, the Magnetic bead-based ELISA can be used to separate COVID-19 positive and negative serum by visual inspection of the results without the need of instrumentation (indeed we just had access to and microplate reader in the end of this project). The method showed similar results when whole blood was used as starting biological material (Fig. 3D) . Therefore, our method can be readily adaptable to point of care analysis. The color developed in the Magnetic beads-based ELISA clearly correlated with the antibody titers obtained in classical ELISA ( Fig. 2 and 3) , thus, our novel method can provide quantitative antibody data in 12 minutes. In this optimized system, we used 1 \u00b5g of N protein antigen and 1 \u00b5l of magnetic beads per test. We estimated that the total price of consumables per sample tested to be approximately R$ 5 (about $1 US). The price can be further reduced with the use of minimal autoinduction medium for the expression of the SARS-CoV-2 N protein antigen, the purification of the protein antigen directly on the Ni 2+ magnetic beads and also with the homemade preparation of TMB.",

However, this may increase cross reactivity background in the negative control serum. Hence, adjustment of reagents concentrations and incubation time are critical to obtain data which can be interpreted visually. The presence of EDTA, which is commonly used as an anticoagulant in serum, did not affect the performance of the method in concentrations up to 50 \u00b5M (Fig S3A) .

In a recent review of different serological techniques for COVID-19 diagnostics (Carter et al. 2020) , all methods described required much longer time to deliver results than the novel method we describe here. There is only one report of a synthetic peptide-coated magnetic-bead chemiluminescence ELISA, which provides 71% sensitive for COVID-19 IgG (Cai et al. 2020 ). In the work by Cai et al., biotinylated synthetic peptides comprising different parts of SARS-CoV-2 proteins were bound to streptavidin-coated magnetic beads. The assays used 0.1 ml of serum as starting material. The total time of the overall process has not been described, however, only the first incubation step already took 10 minutes and a total of ten washing steps was required before the results were delivered by chemiluminescence. This method is available on the market (Bioscience), which claims to deliver results in 30 min.",

Recent literature data showed that homemade indirect ELISA kits perform well in terms of sensitivity and specificity to detect COVID-19 cases when using either Spike or Nucleocapsid protein as antigen (Amanat et al. 2020; OKBA et al. 2020) . Considering that we could show good agreement between our magnetic beadbased ELISA and classic ELISA across all samples used in this study ( Fig. 2 and 3) , we speculate that our method will perform similar or even better than classical ELISA in terms of specificity and sensitivity. Despite the small cohort analyzed in this study (6 positive and 26 negative samples), our method was able to clearly separate all COVID-19 positive and negative cases in minutes. Analysis of larger cohort of samples are underway to provide better statistics of specificity and sensitivity. It worth mentioning that the use of a microplate reader may improve the performance of the assays specially for positive cases carrying low antibody titer (Fig. 3) We believe that the inexpensive, rapid, and quantitative method to detect human antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 described in this study may help to track COVID-19 cases specially in developing countries such as Brazil. The assay requires minimum instrumentation in all phases of production, and it is ready to be evaluated as a COVID-19 diagnostic toll with larger sample cohort and to scale-up production.
