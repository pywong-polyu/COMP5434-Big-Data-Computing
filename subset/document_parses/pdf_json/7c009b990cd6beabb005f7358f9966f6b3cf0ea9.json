            "text": "Admission with critical illness to an Intensive Care Unit (ICU) is a significant 'lifeevent', which has a major impact on the lives of both the patient and their family. During their ICU stay, patients often experience pain, anxiety, distress, fear, tiredness and thirst, which they are often unable to communicate sufficiently. (1) During this difficult journey, the uncertainty and stress is often worse for the patients' families, who are called to fulfil multiple roles during the ICU admission: information provision, comforting influence, caregiving and surrogate decision-making. Family and friend involvement in care has been advocated as the best model of patient management (2, 3) , despite initial negative perceptions and organisational barriers.(4) Professional ICU bodies support family involvement in care, as there is evidence that it improves patient outcomes, reducing clinician burnout and moral distress. (5) (6) (7) During a Public Health Emergency, standard operating procedures may cease to apply. Physical and social distancing, quarantine of a whole area or country, visiting restrictions in hospitals and a more paternalistic approach to decision-making are some of the measures described previously (8) , and experienced recently. (9, 10) During the current pandemic, the UK government imposed a general suspension on hospital visiting, prohibiting family and friends to visit hospitalised patients, even if they were approaching the end of their life (EoL). (10) As the lockdown brought to the forefront the five basic human emotional needs (to feel safe, connected, calm, useful, and hopeful) (11) , safety measures demanded distancing, intensifying the feelings of fear and separation anxiety. (8) In an attempt to lessen the devastating effects of patient/family separation, without compromising the need for quarantine, the UK medical and nursing professional bodies published guidance around different modes of maintaining communication, such as videoconferencing.(12) We present our institution's attempt to mitigate the restrictions on physical presence by creating a bespoke team of professionals, which focused on communication with patients' family and friends (PFF), during the first surge of the coronavirus disease (COVID 19).",

This is in line with observations made elsewhere(22,23) and highlights that restrictions in family visits increases uncertainty around the comfort and care the patients receive, especially during EoL.(22) Interestingly, the absence of family members during the patients' ICU stay and the distress of breaking bad news over the phone were the two most important stressors identified by the clinical staff in our institution. It has been previously demonstrated that supporting relatives during the EoL process is perceived as an integral component of the nursing role, alongside caring for the physical needs of the patient.(24-  26)  Their inability to provide family-centred care, including relinquishing their role as an important information and comfort provider, especially around the patients' last moments, led to a feeling of discomfort and distress, in accordance with other published literature.(27) An attempt to replace physical visiting with virtual presence, using electronic equipment and software, was quickly made in various healthcare systems and recommended as best practice.(28) The majority of the publications have mainly focused on the technological aspect of implementing the software and its potential disadvantages. (29, 30) Our work highlights the intricacies of using redeployed, non-ICU staff for the communication of sensitive, specialised information to PFF. The complexity of the interaction between ICU clinicians and families lies in the fact that the communication goes beyond a simple relay of information. Critical care clinicians aim to optimise the ability of surrogates to hear, understand and use the information provided in order to facilitate decision-making.(31, 32) Interpersonal and communication skills are necessary and are usually acquired in ICU through supervised practice with feedback. The identified discrepancies between the clinical picture that the medical team wanted to convey and the one painted by the FLT may be due to the non-ICU background of the redeployed staff and the different training they had undergone.(33, 34) Comments made by family members (\"the nurses were so helpful, the doctors lacked empathy\") also highlight the importance of incorporating communication skills in core medical training, particularly in ICU.(34, 35) Along the same lines was the evaluation of the service by the providers themselves, the FLT. Despite reporting a sense of purpose and pride in being able to contribute during a time of global need, the members of the team also described feelings of anxiety and moral distress, with approximately 10% of them reporting important information was not always communicated to them by the ICU team. Several explanations can be offered, the most pertinent being the lack of integration of the FLT within the ICU practices. Successful teamwork in ICU is often hampered by a lack of adequate communication, collaboration, and decision-making among team members, leading to discord, disagreement and ultimately conflict.(36) In our study, the FLT interacted with physicians only during the twice daily exchange of information and with the nursing staff during the facilitation of the video calls. No member of the FLT was known to the ICU staff before the redeployment and their participation in decision-making was minimal, even though they had the most interaction with the family members. It is unsurprising that both the 'external team' and the PFF acknowledged the inefficient collaboration, despite their overall satisfaction with the service. The result denotes the inability to integrate the newly formed team, due to the seriousness and urgency of the health emergency.(37) End-of-life is a particularly traumatic time for families, especially when they are asked to participate in decisions around limitation of life-sustaining treatment (LST), a role that isn't welcomed by all surrogate decision-makers.(31) In this study, the commonest concerns expressed by the PFF pertained to the communication around EoL, highlighting the importance of a robust communication strategy in supporting family members in this area. Family presence at time of death and open or more flexible visiting hours were factors that addressed the family needs of critically ill patients.",
