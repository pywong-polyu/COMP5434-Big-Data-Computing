Assessment of readiness to wean is an important step before performing a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT), and patient readiness should be evaluated as soon as possible after the patient recovers from acute respiratory failure. Several parameters have been proposed for predicting the weaning outcome. Rapid shallow breathing index (RSBI), defined as the ratio of breathing frequency to average tidal volume in 1 min (breaths/ min/L), has been shown to be one of the most accurate predictors of weaning outcome [11] . A cut-off value greater than 105 breaths/min/L has been used to predict weaning trial failure [12] . RSBI measurement using a Wright spirometer is a gold standard method; however, it requires a special instrument that might not be available at the bedside.",

In addition, ventilator settings, such as pressure augmentation, positive-end expiratory pressure (PEEP), and a bias flow may also affect ventilator measurement of the RSBI. Data specific to the accuracy and reliability of the RSBI value displayed by the ventilator (RSBI vent ) compared with standard measurement of RSBI using a Wright spirometer (RSBI standard ) are limited. Accordingly, the aim of this study was to evaluate the correlation between the average value of RSBI vent at different time points and RSBI standard , and to assess the accuracy and reliability of these two RSBI measurement techniques. We hypothesized that using the average value of RSBI vent among different time points would increase the evaluated performance parameters compared to RSBI standard .

Respiratory variables measured by the ventilator (i.e. tidal volume, breathing frequency, minute ventilation, and RSBI) were selected to show on the ventilator screen ( Fig. 1 ). After the patient began spontaneous breathing with a flow-by technique for one minute, the two RSBI measurement techniques including RSBI standard and RSBI vent were simultaneously measured for one minute by the same examiner (NAR). RSBI standard was defined as the standard method using Wright spirometer. RSBI vent was defined as the RSBI value measured and displayed by the ventilator.

Assessment of readiness to wean is the first step, and several parameters have been used to assess pulmonary function and to predict weaning outcome, such as breathing frequency, minute ventilation, maximum inspiratory pressure, and RSBI [13, 15] . RSBI, which is the ratio of breathing frequency divided by average tidal volume in one minute, is the most commonly used parameter in routine clinical practice, and a cut-off value below 105 breaths/min/L can predict the likelihood of weaning success [12, 16, 17] .",

            "text": "Measurement of RSBI by Wright spirometer is a gold standard technique; however, it requires a special instrument that might not be available at the bedside. In addition, disconnecting the patient from the ventilator for a few minutes is required, and this may be harmful due to loss of PEEP effect and risk of contamination of the breathing tube and circuit. Measurement of RSBI using the value displayed by the ventilator during unassisted breathing such as flow-by method may be used to avoid the limitations of measuring RSBI by Wright spirometer. Furthermore, recent weaning guideline recommends using low pressure augmentation instead of T-piece or continuous positive airway pressure mode during SBT [18] then continuing pressure delivery with low pressure augmentation SBT after evaluating RSBI using the ventilator display would be preferred because disconnecting the patient from the ventilator is unnecessary. Many modern ICU ventilators can measure and display the RSBI value; however, the displayed value may vary breath by breath according to both the algorithm used to calculate the RSBI value and patient's breathing pattern. Other factors, such as pressure augmentation, PEEP, and a bias flow may also affect the measurement of RSBI. Several studies reported the RSBI value to be significantly lower when applying low level of pressure support and/ or PEEP compared to unassisted breathing [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] . A bias flow in the flow trigger system may also influence the measurement of RSBI. A study by Kheir, et al. [24] found the RSBI value measured by the ventilator in the flow trigger mode to be significantly lower than during unassisted breathing. This can be explained by the effect of a bias flow in the flow trigger system that provides a small amount of pressure support that decreases work of breathing [25] .",

They found no significant difference in RSBI between the two techniques; however, the measurements were not performed simultaneously. Lessa et al. [26] evaluated agreement between RSBI displayed by the ventilator during low level pressure support and digital ventilometer when the patient was disconnected from the ventilator in 22 subjects after postcardiac surgery. They found the RSBI to be significantly different between the two methods, but high agreement for RSBI, breathing frequency, and minute ventilation were still observed. In contrast, a study by de Sousa et al. [27] compared RSBI calculated by the ventilator during pressure support and PEEP of 5 cmH 2 O and traditional method by spirometer. They found a strong correlation and intraobserver variation coefficient between the two methods.",

The measurement of RSBI from the two techniques in our study was performed simultaneously with same ventilator settings by the same examiner. These factors should improve the reliability and accuracy of our results compared to previous studies that made non-simultaneous comparisons and used different ventilator settings. Using the RSBI value measured and displayed by the ventilator is more convenient than the standard technique because it does not require a special instrument, and it can be performed without disconnecting the patient from the ventilator; however, using only a single ventilator-generated RSBI value may lead to an insufficiently accurate prediction of weaning outcome. We found that using the average of 5 ventilator-generated RSBI values during 0-60 s (0, 0-15, 0-30, 0-45, and 0-60 s) improves the correlation between RSBI vent and gold standard RSBI standard . In addition, continuous monitoring (longer than 1 min) of RSBI using the value displayed by the ventilator may be more appropriate than using Wright spirometer in patient who is at risk for SBT failure (i.e. RSBI value between 90 and 110 breaths/min/L) because disconnecting the patient from the ventilator is needed.",
