            "text": "Background: Patients with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome are mainly treated with continuous positive airway pressure. Polysomnography-guided full-night manual titration is the gold standard for continuous positive airway pressure titration, but it is cost-, time-, and effort-consuming. Alternative ways of titration are easier with less cost, time, and effort. In the era of the COVID-19 pandemic, the need to establish more safe strategies is increased. Aim: To choose a rapid, efficient, simple, and safe method with less effort and cost in the measurement of a suitable level of positive airway pressure in the management of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome. Methods: This study enrolled 48 adult patients who had been diagnosed with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome at our sleep unit and were candidates for treatment with continuous positive airway pressure according to AASM 2008 after exclusion of other sleep-related breathing disorders. All patients underwent both laboratory full-night manual titration and auto-titration (by Prisma20A of WEINMANN medical technology, Germany). Manual titration pressure and P95 of auto-titration were obtained and compared with calculated pressures by five predictive formulas (Miljeteig and Hoffstein, S\u00e9ri\u00e8s, Stradling, Loredo, and Lee). Results: Patients included in the study were 25 females (52.1%) and 23 males (47.9%) with a mean\u00b1SD of age of 49.98\u00b110.36 years. Mean\u00b1SD of manual pressure was 10.44\u00b12.49 cmH 2 O, P95 was 10.16\u00b12.64 cmH 2 O, and calculated pressures by different equations were: Miljeteig and Hoffstein, 8.53\u00b12.03; S\u00e9ri\u00e8s, 11.40\u00b11.81; Stradling, 9.68\u00b11.65; Loredo, 9.90 \u00b11.79; and Lee, 10 .61\u00b12.68 cmH 2 O. No significant differences were reported between manual pressure and pressures of auto-titration with S\u00e9ri\u00e8s, Stradling, Loredo, and Lee equations (p=0.112, 0.09, 0.212, 0.213, and 0.657, respectively). Conclusion: Auto-titration can be used as an effective alternative to manual titration with less cost and effort and is more comfortable to patients. Predictive formulas can be used instead of standard and auto-titration especially in resource-limited facilities and in pandemics.",

            "text": "Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) is a major health problem, which is associated with various comorbidities, including increased metabolic and cardiovascular problems, health care fees, traffic accidents, and risks of mortality. 1 The recommended management for most obstructive sleep apnea patients is continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) as it relieves obstruction of the upper airway by elevating intramural pressure, leading to splinting of the airway. 2 In order to initiate treatment with CPAP, effective pressure that eliminates most obstructive events must be titrated previously. 3 An attended diagnostic polysomnogram (PSG), followed by a second attended full-night with PSG guidance and physician supervision to titrate the adequate CPAP manually, is the gold standard for diagnosis and treatment of OSA. 4 It is cost-, effort-, and time-consuming, and leads to a long waiting list, which delays initiation of the CPAP treatment. 5 The search for feasible techniques to replace a standard technique has intensified in the last few years. Automatic titration and therapeutic pressure calculation using predictive formulas have been proven as alternative approaches. 6 Without the intervention of a specialist, the automated positive airway pressure (APAP) device constantly adjusts the effective pressure to the patient's needs based on changes in airflow resistance. The use of APAP is based on the principles of feasibility and cost-effectiveness. 7 Various predictive formulas were established previously, based on different parameters to predict a therapeutic CPAP level such as body mass index (BMI), neck circumference (NC), the lowest oxygen saturation, and other parameters. The accuracy of these formulas, however, has not compelled most practitioners to incorporate them into standard medical practice. 4 In some patients, calculated CPAP can be beneficial in treating OSAS, but automated positive airway pressure (APAP) devices are used more commonly to reduce the requirement for a CPAP titration study. This could be due to APAP's advantage over predictive equations in adjusting for OSAS night-to-night variability. 4 Other methods being considered for their potential to decrease costs and improve accessibility include split-night PSG (SPL), unattended home partial sleep monitoring (UHPSM), and home CPAP auto-titration (CPAP autotitration). However, concerns have been raised about SPL due to deficient diagnostic sampling and deficient time for titration; also, it has been applied only in certain conditions. UHPSM and home auto-titration have been promoted as ways to decrease costs in the evaluation of OSAS, but they are less accurate than full-night PSG and SPL-PSG and are prone to loss of data. 8 This study was set out aiming to choose a rapid, efficient, simple, and safe method with less effort and cost in the measurement of a suitable positive airway pressure level for OSAS patients' management.",

This was the first study to discuss the comparison between different titration modalities and their efficacy for our patients. At the beginning of our study, from our sleep unit records, 100 patients had been diagnosed with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome and were candidates for treatment with CPAP according to the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM 2008). 9 Ten patients who had daytime hypoventilation with the possibility of obesity hypoventilation were excluded. The titration study failed in seven patients due to high residual apnea/hypopnea index (AHI/hr) (2 patients) or short sleep time (5 patients); in 3 of them it failed during auto-titration and in 4 during manual titration. Five patients refused to complete the titration study, as it required several nights to complete the study. After the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic at the end of 2019, we were obligated to postpone most of the titration studies especially at periods of outbreaks. Health resources, institutions, and most of the health care teams were directed to face the pandemic. This led to interruption of the titration study of the 30 patients who had been diagnosed before the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. Finally, 48 patients were enrolled in this study after calculation of sample size using OPEN EPI at power 80% and CI 95%. They were 25 women and 23 men, ranging in age from 27 to 67 years, and their mean\u00b1SD of age was 49.98\u00b110.36 years.",

At the period of the discovery of CPAP, awareness of OSAS was still in its early stages, so the number of patients was relatively low. In recent years, individual CPAP titration has become a major logistic and financial burden owing to the large number of patients who suffer from OSAS. With the global obesity epidemic and the aging of the population, this challenge will continue to escalate in the coming years. 18 Also, long waiting lists lead to delay in initiation of treatment, which is associated with increased morbidity and mortality risks, especially in severe OSAS patients. 3 According to AASM guidelines, manual titration is the gold standard for measurement for appropriate CPAP treatment, and APAP devices should be used only for patients with uncomplicated moderate to severe OSAS, and in the presence of limited resources. 19 In the era of the COVID-19 pandemic, positive airway pressure (PAP) devices are considered one of the routes of virus transmission. Due to aerosolization risk, the main World Associations of Sleep Medicine and the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommended postponing titration studies. 20 It is reasonable to think about simplified alternative techniques leading to the same therapeutic efficacy.",

Also Shaarawy and Gharraf reported no significant difference between manual and auto-titration during split-night study (p=0.06). 29 On the other hand, this contradicts Ficker et al, who only compared a single night therapy with REM+auto device with constant pressure CPAP. During auto-CPAP, the mean pressure was significantly higher than during standard CPAP (p<0.05). 30 Considering the spontaneous variability from night to night in the architecture of sleep and OSAS severity, this study design was not adequate for detecting small differences between the two strategies of treatment. Luo et al reported a highly significant difference between manual titration pressure by virtuoso, Respironics, and automatic titration (P90) by REMstar Auto (p<0.001). 31 The differences in results were because the included studies used different auto-titration protocols. The testing devices are not identical due to the differences in manufacturer's and sleep technicians' experience, which is the source of the heterogeneity. Differences in baseline characteristics of subjects may also be another cause for variability. 5 The disparities between manual titration and autotitration could be attributable to variances in how parameters like snoring, apnea, and hypopnea are evaluated; also, different recording methods were used. During manual titration with PSG guidance, the respiratory effort was measured using an elastic band across the thoracic/abdominal region, as well as oxygen saturation and electroencephalography (EEG). Auto-titration pressures, on the other hand, were automatically determined by the machine's algorithm without respiratory effort, body position, EEG, or oxygen saturation recordings. 26 To ensure the effectiveness of auto-titration, residual AHI/hr after auto-titration was recorded and showed a significant decrease compared with baseline, with a statistically highly significant change.",

            "text": "In a comparison between P95 by auto-titration and other pressures that were calculated by predictive formulas, we reported statistically non-significant differences between P95 and S\u00e9ri\u00e8s, Stradling, Loredo, and This is in accordance with the findings of Wahab and Ahmed, who found that the measured pressure using the Hoffstein equation was significantly much lower than P90 of auto-CPAP. The calculated pressures using the other four algorithms (S\u00e9ri\u00e8s, Stradling, Loredo, and Lee equations) and P90% were not significantly different. 41 The significant difference between the Hoffstein formula and other studied methods makes this equation usually not suitable for determining ideal pressure. This can be explained by the absence of variables that influence the severity of OSAS as this equation takes into account AHI, NC, and BMI, but not race or lifestyle. 3, 42 Although the variables in the S\u00e9ri\u00e8s equation were the same as in the Miljeteig and Hoffstein equation, the calculated pressure using their algorithm was statistically not different from P95%. The distinction is that in the S\u00e9ri\u00e8s equation a small constant was subtracted from the algorithm, whereas in the Hoffstein equation a large constant was subtracted (0.611 vs 5.12, respectively). 41 According to Lacedonia et al, manual or auto-titration is still the best approach to determine the therapeutic pressure. Predictive formulas, on the other hand, can be valuable if applied with prudence and after establishing the true efficacy. 25 Construction of own predictive formula for determining the effective pressure is not necessary; the formula that was derived from the same ethnicity can be adopted and used for the reference formula. 43 The limitations of our study include the fact that the studied patients were derived from only one sleep unit, which could lead to sampling bias. To investigate OSAS risk factors in our country, multicenter research is required. In addition, only adult patients were involved in this study, so our results cannot be applied to children who have OSAS. Lastly, our study lacks follow-up of patients for long periods to evaluate the effectiveness of CPAP treatment after different titration modalities.",

Number and percent were used to describe qualitative data. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was employed to ensure that the distribution was normal. Mean, standard deviation SD, range (minimum and maximum), median, and interquartile range (IQR) were used to describe quantitative data. The significance of the acquired results was assessed at a 5% level (statistically significant at p\u22640.05). To compare different CPAP pressures, a t-test was used. The correlation was done by the Pearson correlation test. The Wilcoxon signed test of non-parametric data is abbreviated as W, and used for assessment of continuous data differences. Scatter plot representation was used for the graphical analysis of the relationship between different pressures. This study included 48 adult patients with a mean\u00b1SD age of 49.98\u00b110.36 years with a range of 27.0-67.0 years. The number of males was 23 (47.9%) patients, and females were 25 (52.1%) patients. Six patients (12.5%) were diagnosed with mild OSA, 14 patients (29.2%) had moderate OSA, and 28 patients (58.3%) were diagnosed as severe as reported inTable 1, which shows different patient characteristics and anthropometrics.All studied cases were included in the three different titration techniques. Data about the values of CPAP titration are introduced inTable 2, which shows that all patients were included in all titration techniques. The mean\u00b1SD values of measurable pressures were: CPAP manual =10.44\u00b12.49 and P95=10.16\u00b12.64 cmH 2 O. The mean\u00b1SD values of calculated pressures were: Miljeteig and Hoffstein=8.53\u00b12.03, S\u00e9ri\u00e8s=11.40\u00b11.81, Stradling=9.68\u00b11.65, Loredo=9.90\u00b11.79, and Lee=10.61 \u00b12.68 cmH 2 O.",
