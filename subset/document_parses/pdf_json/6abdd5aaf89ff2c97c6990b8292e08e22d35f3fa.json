We calculated numbers of community-onset and hospital-onset healthcare-associated laboratoryconfirmed COVID-19 cases in England during the first six months of the pandemic by linking national routinely collected data for SARS-CoV-2 test results with hospital admission data.",

The higher proportion of hospital-onset cases in Mental Health and Learning Disability Trusts probably reflects longer stays in these settings, which include residential and secure psychiatric units, compared with Acute Trusts; COVID-19 mortality among hospital-onset cases in Mental Health and Learning Disability Trust patients (22% for HO.pHA and HO.HA) was lower than in community-onset cases in acute hospitals. However, as noted above, these crude comparisons do not consider a multiplicity of differences between patient groups. Mental health hospitals had relatively fewer inpatients with COVID-19, therefore nosocomial proportions are based on much smaller denominators.

Pillar 2 testing was delivered by central government through academic, public and private partnerships: from April 1 st 2020 it was progressively rolled out to key workers in the NHS, social care and other critical sectors; from May 23 rd the general population could also access testing from this route; from August 1 st it was used to test asymptomatic staff and residents in care homes and for asymptomatic contacts in outbreak investigations. We saw a large expected decrease in the proportion of cases with a temporal link to a hospital record (from 79% in March to 7% in August), as testing policy across the UK expanded from an initial focus on testing in hospitals to community testing.",
