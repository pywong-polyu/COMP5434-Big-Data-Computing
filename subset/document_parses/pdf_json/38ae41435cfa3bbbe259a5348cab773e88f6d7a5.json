Tourism expenditures accounted for 3.2% of the total final demand and value-added revenue induced from tourism-related businesses made up 3.5% of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in South Korea in 1988 (Oh, 2005) . Twenty years later, the contribution of travel and tourism to the Korean GDP is estimated to reach 6.6% in 2008 by the World Travel and Tourism Council (2008) . Before 1988, the Korean government restricted outbound travel by Korean citizens to control the outflow of foreign currency while promoting rigorously inbound tourism through mega events such as the 1986 Asian Games and 1988 Olympic Games. As a result, inbound tourism grew rapidly and South Korea enjoyed a surplus in its balance of payment in travel account. However, the Korean government lifted the restriction on outbound travel by Korean citizens as well as the spending limit on credit card use during overseas travel by passing the Liberalization of Travel Code in late 1988 (Mak, 1992; Singh, 1997) . After the removal of the outbound travel restriction by the government, outbound travel by Korean tourists gradually increased and the trend continued markedly throughout the 1990s and the first part of 2000s. Consequently, South Korea experienced seven consecutive years of deficits in the national balance of payments in travel account from 2000 to 2006. For example, the number of inbound tourists to Korea was recorded at 6.16 million while the number of Korean outbound tourists reached 11.61 million in 2006, resulting in a staggering deficit of $8.49 billion in the balance of payments in travel account (Korean Tourism Organization, 2007) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 340, "end": 350, "text": "(Oh, 2005)", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 478, "end": 511, "text": "Travel and Tourism Council (2008)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1097, "end": 1108, "text": "(Mak, 1992;", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 1109, "end": 1121, "text": "Singh, 1997)", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 1735, "end": 1770, "text": "(Korean Tourism Organization, 2007)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "The Korean outbound tourism demand is primarily for leisure, business, conference, and government travel (Korean Tourism Organization, 2007) .

Jeju Island, located to the southeast of Korea and recently designated as a World Natural Heritage site by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) in June 2007, has been a leisure and honeymoon destination for Koreans. 2 The number of Korean and international tourists to Jeju Island was approximately 4.7 and 0.38 million in 2005 respectively, according to Jeju Special Self-Governing Provincial Tourism Association. 3 Despite Jeju's pristine island landscapes and beach resorts -in comparison to other popular destinations on the Korean peninsula -Korean tourists have been influenced to overseas vacations by many push and pull factors. The push factors include increased discretionary income, relaxed policy on outbound travel and spending, available leisure time, and strong motivations for overseas travel.

Usually, correlation coefficient is given by a constant which is not time-varying. However, in reality, correlation coefficient of tourism demand between two destinations may not be a constant since it can fluctuate over time. The MGARCH model with DCC specification, proposed by Engle (2002) , provides a useful way to estimate conditional (time-varying) variance-covariance matrix.

Once the time-varying correlation series are determined, the effects of major macroeconomic variables can be analyzed by the usual regression setup. It is well known that many macroeconomic variables are non-stationary (Nelson & Plosser, 1982) . It is therefore very useful to apply VECM to evaluating such non-stationary behavior of time-series variables (Engle & Granger, 1987) .

This study applies the multivariate generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (MGARCH) model, one of the most frequently used methods to estimate the timevarying covariance matrix, to determine the conditional correlation coefficient as a measure for analyzing the time-varying relationships of tourism demand for Jeju and the three Asian destinations. The variance-covariance matrix is estimated each time to calculate the time-varying correlation coefficient. In this study, the MGARCH model with the dynamic conditional correlation (DCC) specification proposed by Engle (2002) was adopted to estimate the conditional correlation among the Korean tourism demand for Jeju Island and the three competing Asian destinations. As in previous research, Chan et al.

Moreover, determinants of the conditional correlations are examined using the vector error correction model (VECM) with time-series data of the Industrial Production Index (IPI) and real exchange rate for each country.

Based on Akaike Information Criteria (AIC) and Schwarz Bayesian Criteria (SBC), AR of order 2 lag order 2, or AR (2), is selected. Table 3 shows the estimated results of the proposed MGARCH model using a maximum likelihood estimation method assuming multivariate normality of error distribution. All the autoregressive coefficients are highly significant. All negative values of c i,1 imply that all tourism demand is negatively related with the previous one. The results of conditional variance equations are b imply that the conditional correlation is time-varying. However, the seasonal effects cannot be created. For countries with island destinations, summer or winter effects turn out to be quite significant. For example, the Philippines and Singapore have strong positive winter effects, e.g., the ''January effect'' for Korean tourists to escape the cold climate at home. The conditional variances for Y jeju , Y phil , Y sing , and Y thai are plotted in Fig. 3 . For Jeju, although the volatility of tourist departures were higher than those of the other destinations before 1990, there have been less fluctuations since 1990. The volatility of domestic visitors to Jeju Island were rather stable despite positive mega events or unfavorable events that took place in Korea in recent years, including the Asian Financial Crisis (1997) (1998) (1999) Thus, it can be surmised that Korean outbound travel to these three Asian countries could have different determinants of volatility due to tourist behavior and various other events. Fig. 4 shows time-varying conditional correlations among the four destinations for Korean tourists. Three periodsdbefore 1988, from 1988 to the Asian Financial Crisis (1997), and 1997-2006dare examined and analyzed. Regardless of these categories, all conditional correlations for tourism demand among the three Asian destinations have shown increasing patterns. This implies that a positive relationship tends to increase as time progresses. However, for the conditional correlations of tourism demand between Jeju and the three Asian destinations, there have been negative conditional correlations over certain time horizonsdfor example, in the early 1980s, around 1990, and around 2000. The negative correlation in the early 1980s could be attributed to strict overseas travel control by the Korean government. The negative correlation during this period could be recognized as the ''substitute effect.'' It shows that the change in demand was entailed by the change in the rate of exchange rate between two goods (Varian, 2005) . Most tourists sensitive to the variability of the price could (1997) , there were distinctive ''U''-shape conditional correlations between Jeju and the three Asian countries. Those ''U''-shape conditional corrections can be attributed to certain macroeconomic variables or Korea's country-specific events. From 1997 to 2006, conditional correlations showed a decreasing pattern, a possible indication of sharp upward trends of Korean outbound tourists. All conditional correlations had similar trends from 1980 to 1988. However, when the Liberalization of the Travel Code was instituted in 1988, it had a significant impact on conditional corrections. It was not long before conditional correlations COR12, COR13, and COR23 appeared in the same trends, usually toward the upper drifts. 6 On the other hand, COR14, COR24, and COR34 displayed decreasing trends from 1988 to mid 1990s. 7 These correlations, COR14, COR24, and COR34, always remained below the former three conditional correlations. The Liberalization of the Travel Code (1988) affected clearly tourists' outbound decisions since tourists had more choices of their overseas vacation destinations. Conditional correlations including Jeju Island were always below the patterns of other conditional correlations. It is thus inferred that the Jeju Island was substituted by the Korean outbound tourists for the three Asian destinations. Therefore, it is important to further analyze the trend of Korean outbound tourism demand after a significant tourism policy change, in this case, after the Liberalization of the Travel Code was introduced in 1988.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1597, "end": 1603, "text": "(1997)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1604, "end": 1610, "text": "(1998)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1611, "end": 1617, "text": "(1999)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2817, "end": 2831, "text": "(Varian, 2005)", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 2896, "end": 2902, "text": "(1997)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 391, "end": 398, "text": "Table 3", "ref_id": "TABREF3"}, {"start": 1224, "end": 1230, "text": "Fig. 3", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1800, "end": 1806, "text": "Fig. 4", "ref_id": "FIGREF4"}], "section": "Estimation results for MGARCH model"}, {"text": "Unit-root and cointegration tests are first performed to construct the VECM model.

Competitive pricing of airline fare can promote Jeju Island to Korean mainland outbound tourists. From policy perspective, local and federal governments should consider and support the development of regional low-cost carriers (LCC) to reduce airline transportation cost by drawing experience from the popular Silk Air and Air Asia operated by Singapore Airlines and Thai Airways. In addition, the government can work with the aviation industry to establish a reliable flight-demand forecasting system to plan tourism demand from the Korean mainland. Operationally, tour price for Jeju is obviously higher than those offered by the other competing Asian destinations. Tourism industry in Jeju needs to emphasize the value and experience for the visit. Furthermore, the private sector participants should develop better coordination among travel agencies, airline companies, hoteliers and local merchants to price tour products competitively.More specifically, travel agencies and airline companies should offer various travel package plans which are already well-developed for the overseas visitors to the Korean mainland outbound tourists. Though there are already package plans such as various honeymoon packages, school excursion, and Gold package, for Jeju visitors, these plans are not sophisticated to meet the varied domestic tourism demand.
