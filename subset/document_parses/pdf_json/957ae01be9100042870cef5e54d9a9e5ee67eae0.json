Escape of Beta variant from neutralization by convalescent plasma and vaccine-induced sera was observed in some studies [12, 59, 60]. Although neutralization titers against Gamma variant are reduced, it is hoped that immunization with vaccines designed against parent strains will protect Gamma variant infection [61]. The Delta variant escapes neutralization by some antibodies that target the receptor-binding domain or N-terminal domain, the neutralization titers against Delta was three to five folds than Alpha variant when two-dose of the vaccine administrated.[14]This study also supports the two-dose vaccine regimen recommended by the FDA and EMA, which is consistent with an in-vitro study for SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern [62].This review included 3 study designs evaluating 8 COVID-19 vaccines against 4 VOC in differentpopulations. There is high heterogeneity between studies, and high statistical heterogeneity is also observed in most analysis. Other factors like the definition of outcomes (all SARS-CoV-2 or symptomatic infection), days after vaccination and participant's characteristics (e.g., age and race) may also contribute to the heterogeneity.

The VE for mRNA vaccines seemed to be higher than others.We conducted this systematic review and meta-analysis to synthesize evidence on the VE ofCOVID-19 vaccines against VOC during the pandemic. This study has four main findings. First, full vaccination of COVID-19 vaccines was effective against Alpha, Beta/Gamma and Delta variants, with the VE of 88.3% (95% CI, 82.4-92.2), 70.7% (95% CI, 59.9-78.5) and 71.6% (95% CI, 64.1-77.4), respectively. Second, partial vaccination has lower VE against Alpha, Beta/Gamma and Delta variants, with the VE of 59.0% (95% CI, 51.3-65.5), 49.3% (95% CI, 33.0-61.6), 52.6% (95% CI, 43.3-60.4), respectively. Third, mRNA vaccines (BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273) seemed to have higher VE against VOC over other vaccines. Fourth, more evidence was needed to evaluate the VE of COVID-19 against the Gamma and Delta variants. To our knowledge, our study is the first comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis to characterize the VE of COVID-19 vaccines against VOC. The evidence for the Gamma variant was insufficient, only four studies were included [32, 35, 36, 49]. One study [36] enrolled residents or staff in long term care homes and two [32, 35] enrolled older adults aged 70 years and older, which reflected the VE against Gamma variant for elderly and frail people. The remaining one study evaluating the CoronaVac vaccine against the Gamma variant enrolled healthcare workers, but unmeasured confounding which led to downward bias in the VE estimate was reported [49].",
