However, rapidly emerging data suggest that people on immunomodulatory medications for a variety of underlying medical conditions, including solid organ transplantation (SOT) and rheumatologic disease, may not develop severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-specific humoral or cellular responses to full COVID-19 vaccination [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] . For example, nearly one-half of SOT recipients failed to develop detectable anti-spike antibody responses after a single dose of mRNA vaccine in a recent study [8] , although many of these individuals were taking multiple immunosuppressive medications (eg, glucocorticoids, mycophenolate, calcineurin inhibitors). Reductions in antibody responses have also been observed in patients with rheumatologic and inflammatory disorders on a variety of biological and nonbiological disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs including those on a single agent [5, 7] . Overall, antibody neutralization appears to correlate with SARS-CoV-2 anti-receptor binding domain (RBD) antibody levels and virusspecific CD4 T-cell responses following vaccination and natural infection [2, 4, 9, 10] .",

First, it is not known whether alternative vaccine strategies, such as giving a third dose of the same or a different vaccine, will lead to increased humoral and cellular immune responses in those with suboptimal responses after completing full vaccination. Second, it is not clear if stopping various immunosuppressive medications for a set period around vaccination will allow a more robust vaccine response. Third, it is not known whether detectable antibody or T-cell responses will be fully protective in immunocompromised individuals or mirror neutralization capacity of such a response [10] . In order to provide insight into these questions and spur discussion about how to manage vaccination in immunocompromised individuals, we performed longitudinal, in-depth humoral and cellular immune characterization before and after mRNA COVID-19 vaccination, including an additional third dose, in a patient on anti-B-cell therapy and low-dose steroids for connective tissue disease.",

Subsequent workup revealed substantially elevated and rising titers of anti-GAD-65 and anti-SSA/anti-SSB antibodies and central autonomic dysfunction. Initial infusion of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) enabled the patient to ambulate well enough for hospital discharge and resolved the paresthesia, but did not produce durable improvement, with temporary improvement after repeat IVIG infusions but then relapse and an overall downward trajectory. After trials of pulse steroids and plasma exchange therapy, the patient improved on a combination of the anti-B-cell monoclonal antibody, rituximab (starting April 2020), oral steroid taper, hydroxychloroquine, and regular IVIG infusions, on which she remained at the time of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. The patient's last rituximab dose was 231 days before her first dose of mRNA COVID-19 vaccine (Moderna), but she had a CD-19 B-cell percentage of \u22641% before and after vaccination ( Figure 1 ). On advice from the patient's clinical team and clinical laboratory testing, she received a third mRNA vaccine dose (Moderna) as part of her clinical care. The decision to receive a third dose was independent from her participation in this study.",

Total SARS-CoV-2 anti-RBD antibody levels were tested using a Pylon enhanced fluorescence assay, and we determined neutralization capacity using a surrogate virus neutralization test (sVNT) based on antibody-mediated blockage of the ACE2-spike protein-protein interaction, as previously described [11] . As shown in Figure 1A , the patient developed a low but detectable total antibody response 20 days after the first mRNA vaccine dose (31 relative light units [RLU] ). Total antibody levels peaked 13 days after the second Moderna mRNA vaccine dose (2802 RLU) but started to decline by 27 days after this second administration (392 RLU). A third dose of Moderna vaccine was administered 47 days after the second vaccine, but total antibody levels continued to decline as shown in Figure 1A , decreasing to 135 RLU 43 days after the third vaccination and 13 days after rituximab infusion. In contrast, antibody levels in 2 healthy control participants not taking immunosuppressive medications that were measured 36 and 47 days after the second dose of mRNA vaccine (Moderna) were >2.5 times higher (9190 and 7285 RLU). Surprisingly, the patient had no detectable antibody neutralization by sVNT at any time point after vaccination, whereas the controls demonstrated robust neutralization (IC50 of 89 and 91).",

            "text": "Although case reports are now emerging of suboptimal humoral and cellular immune responses to COVID-19 vaccination in immunocompromised individuals [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] 13] , there is a paucity of data regarding the impact of a third dose of vaccine and correlations between commercial antibody assays and neutralization capacity in this population. This case provides insight into several of the outstanding but critically important questions regarding vaccine responses in the setting of immunomodulatory medications. First, despite developing a detectable antibody response after completing 2 doses of mRNA COVID-19 vaccination, these levels were lower than observed in several immunocompetent participants not taking immunosuppression following full mRNA vaccination and declined after the second vaccine dose. Total antibody levels continued to decline despite a third vaccine dose. Second, despite detectable, albeit waning, antibody levels, this patient mounted no detectable neutralization activity. Neutralization capacity is one of the best predictors of in vivo vaccine efficacy [2] , and without neutralizing antibodies, it is not known if this patient will be protected from acquisition of COVID-19 or will demonstrate reduced severity if infected. Of note, antibody levels and neutralization are generally concordant in healthy and immunocompromised individuals and also correlate highly with viral-specific CD4 T-cell responses [9, 10, 12] . Third, despite suboptimal antibody responses, the patient developed SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific polyfunctional CD4 and CD8 T-cell responses that were generally similar to the postvaccine control samples. It is not known if these adaptive cellular responses are protective against COVID-19 acquisition or severe disease, as cutoffs between T-cell responses and vaccine efficacy have not been defined in any population [10] . A discordance between the development of anti-spike antibodies and T-cell immunity has been previously reported in SOT recipients, with up to 50% of patients who did not develop antibody responses still having SARS-CoV-2-specific T-cells [4] . Nonetheless, case reports are emerging of severe disease in transplant recipients despite full vaccination [13] , suggesting that these patients may be vulnerable regardless of development of humoral or cellular responses.",

Anti-B-cell antibody therapies have been associated with reduced antibody responses in those with rheumatologic conditions, but this case suggests that very low percentages of circulating B-cells, which can persist for many months following rituximab therapy, may cause impaired humoral vaccine responses. It is also possible that ongoing hydroxychloroquine therapy led to bone marrow suppression contributing to low circulating B-cell levels. The timing of the IVIG infusions and blood draws largely precludes any possibility that the more robust, though short-lived, antibody response after the second dose was due to passive transfer of antibodies from the IVIG; SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody levels were not available from the infused units. A limitation of the study was the use of a surrogate neutralization assay in lieu of measuring direct neutralization of infectious virus, and there may only be modest correlations between the surrogate and more direct assays [9] .",
