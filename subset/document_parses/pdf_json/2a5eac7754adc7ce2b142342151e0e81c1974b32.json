While we agree that the net effect on hypoxemia depends on a multitude of factors, large shunts are-by definitionrefractory to inspired oxygen and to increases in minute ventilation. What is more, the alterations of respiratory drive in COVID-19 are complex and not necessarily due to absolute levels of hypoxaemia; many patients experience high levels of respiratory drive even when hypoxaemia is mild or corrected. It stands to reason, therefore, that the hypoxaemic stimulus is physiologically unlikely to cause high drive per se, nor is increased ventilation able to compensate for hypoxaemia (or improve the dead space fraction). This would seem self-evident, given the rather high number of patients requiring respiratory support.
