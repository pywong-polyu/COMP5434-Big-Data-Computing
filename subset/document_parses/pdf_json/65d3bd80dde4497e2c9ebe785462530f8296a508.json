Despite their functional significance and links to several diseases, structural information on full-length kindlin proteins remains unknown. Here, we report the crystal structure of human full-length kindlin-3, which reveals a novel homotrimer state. Unlike kindlin-3 monomer, which is the major population in insect and mammalian cell expression systems, kindlin-3 trimer does not bind integrin \u03b2 cytoplasmic tail as the integrin-binding pocket in the F3 subdomain of 1 protomer is occluded by the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain of another protomer, suggesting that kindlin-3 is auto-inhibited upon trimer formation. This is also supported by functional assays in which kindlin-3 knockout K562 erythroleukemia cells reconstituted with the mutant kindlin-3 containing trimer-disrupting mutations exhibited an increase in integrin-mediated adhesion and spreading on fibronectin compared with those reconstituted with wild-type kindlin-3. Taken together, our findings reveal a novel mechanism of kindlin auto-inhibition that involves its homotrimer formation. OPEN ACCESS Citation: Bu W, Levitskaya Z, Loh ZY, Jin S, Basu S, Ero R, et al.

            "text": "Integrin-mediated cell-cell and cell-extracellular matrix interactions are crucial for many physiological and pathological processes. Recently, the 4.1 protein, ezrin, radixin and moesin (FERM)-domain-containing kindlin family of proteins has emerged as key players involved in integrin activation. The 3 members are kindlin-1, kindlin-2, and kindlin-3 [1] (Fig 1A) . The importance of kindlins is underscored by their link to Kindler syndrome (a disorder within the spectrum of hereditary epidermolytic blistering diseases), leukocyte adhesion deficiency (LAD) III (a hereditary primary immunodeficiency with platelet dysfunction disease), and cancer [2, 3] . The sequence homology between kindlin-1 and kindlin-2 is 62%, and those between kindlin-1 and kindlin-3, as well as kindlin-2 and kindlin-3 are 54% and 52%, respectively (44% for all 3) . In addition to sequence similarity, all kindlins share atypical FERM domain organization comprising the F1, F2, and F3 subdomains (Fig 1A and S1 Fig) have revealed that the poly-lysine-containing loop in the F1 subdomain of kindlins is important for interactions with membrane lipids [4, 5] . The F2 subdomain is bisected by a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, which is involved in binding membrane phosphatidylinositol lipids [6] . In particular, the PH domain has an essential role for kindlin-3 in integrin-mediated B cell adhesion and migration [6] . The F3 subdomain binds to the highly conserved membrane distal NxxY/F motif in the integrin \u03b2 cytoplasmic tail [7] .",

Integrin activation involves conformational changes [9] , which are regulated by interaction between their cytoplasmic tails and cytoplasmic proteins [10] . Kindlins cooperate with talin to positively regulate integrin activation [11] . Kindlins do not directly interact with talin. Instead, both molecules can simultaneously associate with a single integrin \u03b2 cytoplasmic tail [12] . There are 2 well-defined motifs that are part of a canonical recognition sequence for phosphotyrosine-binding (PTB) domains in the \u03b2 tails of integrin: the membrane proximal and distal motifs NPxY and NxxY (x: other amino acids), respectively [13] . Talin binds the membrane proximal NPxY motif, whereas kindlin binds the membrane distal NxxY motif [11] . Despite clear functional evidence of kindlins serving as positive regulators of integrin activation, the detailed mechanism remains to be determined.",

Despite a number of biochemical and structural studies on kindlins, their full-length structure is still unknown [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] . Nonetheless, the structure of a truncated mouse kindlin-2 suggests a mechanism by which kindlin-2 forms homodimer that promotes integrin clustering [18] . However, it should be noted the strategy employed in the aforementioned study in order to facilitate crystallization involved removing the PH domain, resulting in artificially linking the 2 sides of the F2 domain as well as deleting the long loop within the F1 domain. These modifications could potentially generate global perturbations in the native kindlin-2 structure, which, in turn, may explain the extremely slow process of dimerization reported in the same study.",

This is supported by cell-based functional studies in which cells expressing a mutant kindlin-3 containing disrupting mutations in its trimer interface exhibited overt \u03b21 integrin-mediated cell adhesion and spreading as compared with cells expressing wild-type kindlin-3.

            "text": "To gain mechanistic insights into the functions of kindlins, characterization of their full-length structure at atomic resolution is required. Full-length kindlins contain disordered regions that are intrinsically recalcitrant to crystallization. Through extensive and time-consuming efforts of large-scale preparation of highly homogeneous kindlins and subsequent crystallization trials, we were ultimately able to crystallize human full-length kindlin-3 that was expressed as a single monomeric species in bacterial Escherichia coli BL21 system. Consequently, we determined the first structure of human full-length kindlin-3, using the selenine (Se)-single-wavelength anomalous diffraction (SAD) phasing method in combination with Phenix program (Paul Adams, Randy Read, Jane & Dave Richardson, Tom Terwilliger; https://www.phenix-online.org/) [19, 20] (Fig 1B, S2-S4 Figs) . Unexpectedly, we observed 3 molecules of kindlin-3 forming a homotrimer in an asymmetric unit of the crystal with each protomer dovetailing the next. Each kindlin-3 monomer adopts a cloverleaf-like overall conformation. Except for the F2 domain, which is an \u03b1-bundle, the other 4 domains are composed of an \u03b1/\u03b2 barrel. The overall structure of human kindlin-3 monomer is similar to that of truncated mouse kindlin-2 [18] ; however, the relative positioning of the PH domain can be resolved in the former. The N-terminal F0 domain adopts a ubiquitin-like fold comprising 5 \u03b2-stands and 2 helices (\u03b11 F0 and \u03b12 F0 ), forming a classical \u03b1/\u03b2 barrel. The F1 domain contains an \u03b1/\u03b2 barrel similar to that of the F0 domain, but it has a long loop (residues 145-228) that is conserved amongst kindlins and functionally important [5] . Except for residues 146-174, most components of this 83-residues-long region can be modeled, with the loop 181-187, the loop 196-207, and its subsequently connecting helices \u03b12 F1 and \u03b13 F1 interacting with domains PH, F2, and F3, respectively ( Fig 1B) . Similar to kindlins, talin also contains a F1 loop but shorter in length (31 residues). The positively charged F1 loop binds the negatively charged membrane, which is required for the regulatory functions on integrins [5, 21, 22] . The F1 domain resides at the center of the kindlin-3 structure with the F1 loop wrapped around its \u03b1/\u03b2 barrel and interacting with other domains. This arrangement may contribute, in part, to the functional difference between kindlins and talin, given the different lengths of their F1 loops [22] .",

The remaining 3 helices form an \"arch\" arrangement and pack against the \u03b12 F2 helix. The PH domain, which is inserted between \u03b12 F2 and \u03b13 F2 , comprises 7 \u03b2-strands and 2 \u03b1-helices. The 7 \u03b2-strands are assembled in 2 perpendicular antiparallel \u03b2-sheets (the first 4 orthogonal to the remaining 3), which forms a compact \u03b2-barrel. One end of this barrel is blocked by the C-terminal \u03b1-helices (\u03b11 PH and \u03b12 PH ), and the opposite end of the barrel is rich in positively charged residues and exposed, suggesting that it may be involved in membrane lipid binding [17] . In parallel with these 2 \u03b1-helices (\u03b11 PH and \u03b12 PH ), a loop between \u03b12 F2 and \u03b21 PH was modeled at the N-terminus of the PH domain ( Fig  1B) . Given the limited electron density map and a lack of a molecular model, this loop appears to be a helix interacting with \u03b12 PH to stabilize the entire domain (S5 Fig). The PH domain, widely distributed in other protein families (the 11th most common domain family in human proteome), has been implicated in diverse biological processes, including intracellular signaling, cytoskeleton constitution, intracellular membrane trafficking, and membrane phospholipids modification [23, 24] .",

Kindlin-3 trimer adopts a triangular prism-like structure along the noncrystallographic 3-fold symmetry axis with the following dimensions: an outer-side length of approximately 110 \u00c5, an inner cavity width of approximately 60 \u00c5, and a height of approximately 90 \u00c5. Our crystal structure data of kindlin-3 trimer were obtained using homogenous kindlin-3 monomers expressed and purified from E. coli. To exclude the possibility of crystallization artefacts, it is important to determine whether kindlin-3 trimer exists in eukaryotic cells. To this end, human full-length kindlin-3 was expressed and purified from a clonal isolate of Spodoptera frugiperda Sf21 cells (Sf9) insect cells. We were able to isolate both kindlin-3 monomer and trimer forms, based on their molecular weights calibrated by analytical gel filtration chromatography ( Fig 2D) . Furthermore, the particle size of a kindlin-3 trimer was approximately 10-12 nm based on negative staining electron microscopy (EM) (S6 Fig), which is comparable in size with that observed in the crystal structure. In addition, we performed disuccinimidyl sulfoxide (DSSO: a mass spectrometry-cleavable crosslinker) crosslinking of kindlin-3 monomer and trimer followed by analytical gel filtration and mass spectrometry (MS) analysis. The crystal structure of kindlin-3 trimer also reveals that the additional \u03b12 PH helix in the PH domain of protomer A directly wedges into a cleft involving the 2 C-terminal helices (\u03b11 F3 and \u03b12 F3 ) and the \u03b2-sheet (\u03b25 F3 -\u03b27 F3 ) in the F3 domain of protomer B, thereby forming extensive contacts. The residues Thr467, Ser468, Val470, Gln471, Ala475, and Ser478 in \u03b12 PH of protomer A interact with Ser595, Gln599, Trp600, Ser642, Thr643, Leu656, and Gln659 located in \u03b25 F3 0 and its preceding loop, and \u03b11 F3 0 of F3 domain in protomer B (the prime 0 refers to protomer B in the trimer), respectively ( Fig 2C) . In addition, the C-terminus of \u03b11 PH and its subsequent loop in the PH domain pack against the 2 C-terminal helices and their connecting loop in the F3 domain of protomer B, through H-bonding (Gln443 in protomer A with main chain of Phe640 in protomer B) and salt bridge (Arg447 in A-Asp653 in B) interactions ( Fig 2C) . Therefore, we proposed that the triple mutations Q471A, A475F, and S478A (henceforth referred to as AFA) could disrupt the protomer-protomer interface in kindlin-3 trimer. Indeed, the AFA mutant kindlin-3 forms only monomer in solution when expressed in insect cells (Fig 2D) .",

The dimer interface of mouse kindlin-2, in which the PH domain was removed and the 2 halves of F2 domain were artificially linked, involves an equivalent helical bundle from F2 of protomer A in the kindlin-3 structure ( Fig 3A) . This suggests that in full-length kindlins, the assembly of a dimer via the F2 interface may be severely limited by steric clashes (Fig 3B) . In accordance, dimer formation of PH-deleted mouse kindlin-2 in solution was reported to occur only after several days [18] . Using similar conditions, dimer formation of human full-length kindlin-2 was also not detected by us, implying that the presence of the PH domain possibly interferes with dimer formation. However, given that the PH domain is linked to the F2 domain via flexible loops, the possibility that the PH domain orients away allowing dimer formation via the F2 interface cannot be completely ruled out, and perhaps more studies are needed.",

In cells transfected with all 3 plasmids, there will be kindlin-3 trimers with different combinations of each fusion protein, but only the combination consisting of one molecule each of HA-kindlin-3, N-eYFP-kindlin-3, and C-eYFP-kindlin-3 will fluoresce under excitation after immunoprecipitation.

The AFA mutant was designed to potentially disrupt the protomer-protomer interface. The F3 domain-deleted (F3\u0394) mutant was chosen because F3 is required for trimer formation through its interaction with the PH domain. The system made use of 3 expression plasmids, namely, HA-kindlin-3, N-eYFP(12G)-kindlin-3, and C-eYFP(12G)-kindlin-3. When an HEK 293T cell is transfected with all 3 expression plasmids, there will be trimers that have different combinations of monomers with different tags (i.e., HA, N-eYFP, C-eYFP). One of these combinations will contain one molecule each of HA-kindlin-3, N-eYFP(12G)-kindlin-3, and C-eYFP (12G)-kindlin-3. This combination can also facilitate BiFc via coming together of N-eYFP and C-eYFP. In order to detect this trimer population, immunoprecipitation can be performed using anti-HA antibody and protein G nanobeads, and YFP fluorescence can be detected by flow cytometry analysis. Interestingly, the highest fluorescence signal was detected with WT kindlin-3, followed by the AFA and F3\u0394 mutants captured nanobeads, and the difference was statistically significant ( Fig  5C) . We inferred that AFA mutations diminished kindlin-3 trimer formation, but the disruption was lesser than that caused by F3 domain deletion. We noted that there is still fluorescence signal detected in the F3\u0394 sample. This could be due to nonspecific background binding to the beads and low level of self-association between N-eYFP and C-eYFP (a common observation in BiFc experiments) independent of kindlin-3 trimer formation.",

We reasoned that if kindlin-3 trimer represents an auto-inhibited state that is in dynamic equilibrium, as a mode of regulation, with kindlin-3 monomer in cells, then preventing trimer formation could induce overt integrin activation. To test this hypothesis, we performed functional studies in mammalian cells. The erythroleukemia K562 cell line can endogenously express kindlin-3 and integrin \u03b15\u03b21, and we have shown previously that silencing kindlin-3 expression in K562 cells diminished integrin \u03b15\u03b21-mediated binding to fibronectin [26] . K562 cells also do not express kindlin-1 and kindlin-2, which are useful for interrogating the functions solely attributed by kindlin-3. In order to exclude any contribution from endogenous kindlin-3, CRISPR-Cas9n kindlin-3 gene knockout (KO) was performed, and the expression of kindlin-3 was verified by immunoblotting ( Fig 6A) . Next, kindlin-3 KO K562 cells were transfected and complemented with either WT (K3 WT) or AFA mutant (K3 AFA) kindlin-3 ( Fig 6A) . K562 cells expressed primarily \u03b21 integrins. Based on flow cytometry analysis using a \u03b21 integrin-specific monoclonal antibody (mAb), we showed that there was no marked difference in \u03b21 integrin expression between K562 (K3 WT) and K562 (K3 AFA) cells (Fig 6B) . Hence, any difference in \u03b21 integrin-mediated cell adhesion and spreading between these cells is not attributed to a difference in \u03b21 integrin expression. We then performed shear flow ligand-binding assay to determine the adhesive properties of these cells on fibronectin. As expected, kindlin-3 KO cells adhered less onto fibronectin compared with WT K562 cells even in the presence of exogenous activating agent MnCl 2 . Notably, K3 AFA cells adhered significantly higher than that of K3 WT cells with or without MnCl 2, suggesting overt \u03b21 integrin activation (Fig 6C) . In line with this observation, K3 AFA cells also exhibited increased cell spreading on fibronectin compared with K3 WT cells (Fig 6D) . Taken together, these results suggest that kindlin-3 exists as both monomers and trimers in mammalian cells, and that the latter represents an auto-inhibited state. Shifting the equilibrium between these 2 populations of kindlin-3 may be an important regulatory step in kindlin-3 function.",

Although kindlins have been shown to bind integrin \u03b2 cytoplasmic tails, there is limited information on its regulation. Phosphorylation of kindlin-3 at Thr482/Ser484 has been shown to be important for kindlin-3-induced integrin activation, but the mode of action remains unclear [27] . Talin adopts a default low-affinity state for integrin-binding in which its \"rod\" region folds back and masks the integrin-binding pocket (also known as the PTB) in the F3 subdomain of its head region [28] . Conceivably, talin in an auto-inhibited state is important for preventing the deleterious activation of integrins. Unlike talins, kindlins do not possess a \"rod\" region. The structure of mouse PH-deleted kindlin-2 reveals a cloverleaf-like conformation in which the integrin-binding site in the F3 subdomain is exposed [18] . Hence, it is unlikely that kindlins can adopt an auto-inhibited state, if it exists, via intramolecular interactions. However, it does not rule out the possibility of auto-inhibition via homo-oligomerization.",

We also showed that human kindlin-3 can form trimer that is incapable of binding the integrin \u03b21A cytoplasmic tail (Figs 2-5 and S2-S10 Figs), suggesting that kindlin-3 can adopt an auto-inhibited state via homo-oligomerization. This could be explained by the observation that the integrin-binding pocket (PTB) in the F3 subdomain of one protomer is occluded by the last helix \u03b12 PH of another protomer in the structure of the kindlin-3 trimer. Furthermore, functional investigations of the AFA mutant kindlin-3 in cells through shear flow fibronectin-binding assay and fluorescence microscope imaging are also in support of an auto-inhibited state of kindlin-3 homotrimer (Fig 6C and 6D ). Our data appear contrary to a study in which mouse PH-deleted kindlin-2 forms a dimer and promotes integrin clustering [18] . Based on our data, the presence of the PH domain may interfere to a certain degree with dimer formation (Fig 3A  and 3B ). In line, the presence of full-length kindlin-3 as well as kindlin-2 dimers were not detected in our assays. However, we do not completely rule out the possibility of kindlins forming dimers under certain conditions given that the PH domain is linked to the F2 via flexible loops, allowing movement of the PH domain to possibly accommodate dimer formation. Along this line, we have provided evidence of kindlin-3 and kindlin-2 being able to form trimer, but the conditions leading to the formation or dissociation remains unknown. Taken together, these can be interesting future studies to pursue.",

Our findings that kindlin-3 trimer does not bind integrin \u03b21A cytoplasmic tail suggest alternative mechanism(s) that need not involve kindlin oligomerization. First, integrin clustering can be induced by kindlins via their interactions with filamentous actin (F-actin) and focal adhesion proteins, including integrin-linked kinase (ILK) and paxillin [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] . Second, kindlins assist binding of talin to integrin \u03b2 cytoplasmic tails. Hence, integrin clustering can be promoted by talin, which is known to form a dimer and bind F-actin [35] . Third, phosphoinositides are dynamically distributed in cells. Phosphatidylinositol(3,4,5)-trisphosphate (PtdIns(3,4,5)P3) is concentrated at the leading edge of neutrophils and Dictyostelium discoideum [36] . Hence, it is possible that the clustering of integrins by kindlins may be induced in part by the binding of kindlins to PtdIns(3,4,5)P3.",

The SeMet datasets were processed, merged, and converted similarly to the native datasets, with the exception that the Friendel's Law was set to FALSE. The initial search of the heavy atom sites was performed with SHELX combined with phenix.autosol, yielding 30 sites with reasonable occupancy in an asymmetric unit (11 non-START methionine theoretically exists in each kindlin-3 molecule) [19, 20] .

Because the model structure (PDB entry: 5XPZ) lacked the PH domain, we search the map for a PH domain homologue (PDB entry: 5L81) using molecular replacement with phenix.phaser. The model was then refined iteratively using phenix.refine. The refined model was used to perform molecular replacement (phenix.phaser) with the native data. The model sequence was then corrected using Chainsaw, and the model was refined iteratively using phenix.refine and Lorestr [42] .

The flow chamber was assembled on a microscope stage housed in a 37\u02daC incubator. Cells were resuspended in Hanks' Balanced Salt Solution without or with 0.5 mM MnCl 2. Cells were infused into the chamber at a shear stress of 0.3 dyn/cm 2 shear using a syringe pump. Total number of adherent cells in 4 different fields of the chamber were counted. The average number of cells per field was then calculated.",

Cells were allowed to adhere on fibronectin under culture conditions for 2 hours. Medium was discarded, and cells were fixed in 3.7% (w/v) paraformaldehyde-PBS solution at RT for 10 minutes. Cells were then incubated in CSK buffer (100 mM NaCl, 300 mM sucrose, 3 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM EGTA, 10 mM PIPES [pH 6.8]) containing 0.3% (v/v) Triton at RT for 1 minute. Cells were washed 3 times with PBS and nonspecific sites blocked with PBS containing 5% (w/v) BSA overnight at 4\u02daC. Fixed cells were stained with DAPI and Alexa Fluor 488 phalloidin (Invitrogen Corporation, Carlsbad, CA). Cells were visualized under confocal laser scanning microscope LSM710 (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) at a magnification of 40\u00d7 and 100\u00d7 under oil immersion. inter-(blue) molecules crosslinks were mapped onto the kindlin-3 crystal structure. The intermolecular crosslink marked with a blue asterisk is approximately 30 \u00c5. It was identified with very high confidence. The intermolecular crosslink marked with a green asterisk is approximately 34 \u00c5. It was identified with a relatively low confidence but also appears reasonable upon inspection of the structure. Besides, both 2 intramolecular crosslinks were identified with very high confidence. Sf9 monomer. The protein tested is the monomer form of native kindlin-3, which is expressed in Sf9 insect cells. ITC measurement demonstrated a moderate binding between integrin \u03b21 tail and monomeric kindlin-3. (b) Binding assay for kindlin-3 Sf9 trimer. The protein used is native kindlin-3 trimer, which is expressed in Sf9 insect cells. In agreement with our structural data (Fig 3C) , kindlin-3 trimer shows no binding to integrin \u03b21 tail. (c) Binding assay for kindlin-2 Sf9 monomer. The protein used is native kindlin-2 monomer expressed in Sf9. Compared with monomeric kindlin-3, ITC measurement indicated a much stronger binding between integrin \u03b21 tail and monomeric kindlin-2. (d) Binding assay for kindlin-2 Sf9 trimer. The protein used is native kindlin-2 trimer expressed in Sf9. In agreement with kindlin-3 trimer, kindlin-2 trimer shows no binding to integrin \u03b21 tail.

This indicated that monomer kindlin-3 was crosslinked to trimer kindlin-3. In addition, DSSO-treated trimer kindlin-3 also exhibited a clear band above 200 k Da on denaturing SDS-PAGE (S7C Fig). Both 2 crosslinked trimeric bands were sent for MS fragmentation analysis. There were 4 pairs of identified crosslinked residues, among which 3 have very high confidence (S8Fig and S1 Data). Interestingly, 2 lysine residues from \u03b11 PH (LASKGR) of one protomer and \u03b22 F3' (KDEILGIANNR) of another protomer were crosslinked by DSSO, and it is consistent with their near distance in the crystal structure of the kindlin-3 trimer.
