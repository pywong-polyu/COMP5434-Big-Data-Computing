Information on demographic characteristics, medical history, symptoms of the disease, diagnostic test results and treatment regimen of each patient were extracted from their hospital records. The state and severity of dry mouth were assessed via the visual analog scale (VAS) and were registered daily until all of the dry mouth symptoms resolved. To this end, patients were asked to rate the severity of dry mouth using a scoring system from 0 (for the absence of dry mouth) to 10 (for the most severe case of dry mouth). Thus, the changes in dry mouth symptoms were monitored and evaluated during the disease.",

Further, one of the subjects had an allergy and was taking antihistamines including hydroxyzine. One of the patients was a heavy smoker. However, all of these patients had never experienced dry mouth and had no complaints of symptoms before developing COVID-19 (it was the first time they had complained of dry mouth). Other patients had no medical history and did not take any specific medication. The most common symptoms at the time of admission were fever, cough, shortness of breath, fatigue and lethargy, although gastrointestinal symptoms and loss of taste were also reported in two cases. Diagnostic tests for COVID-19 included RT-PCR and CT scan of the lungs was carried out at the time of admission for all patients. The patients' treatment regimens were comparatively similar and included antiviral drugs, hydroxychloroquine, antibiotics and oxygen supplementation. Based on their medical history, none of the patients maintained a history of radiotherapy or treatment with radioactive iodine of head and neck.",

Symptoms of dry mouth appeared in six patients (60% of cases) 3-4 days before the general infection symptoms such as fever and respiratory complications. In other patients, dry mouth was observed simultaneously or 1-2 days after the onset of other symptoms (including cough and shortness of breath). In patients who had started with general symptoms such as fever and respiratory symptoms, dry mouth symptoms such as dysphagia, foamy saliva, and dry lips were often observed at higher degrees of VAS. In all cases, with starting the treatment and recovery, the symptoms of dry mouth gradually decreased. Moreover, in most cases (eight patients), it completely disappeared after a few days (2-13 days). Only two patients still displayed slight degrees of dry mouth after almost three weeks (VAS = 1-2). In our hospital setting, negativization of PCR test was not considered as a criterion for the patient's remission and discharge. Most of the patients were not tested again to investigate the negativization. Therefore, no data about oral indicators after negativization of PCR are provided. We recommend a comparison of VAS or xerostomia inventory between patients during pathology and the same patients after 1 month of negativization of RT-PCR. It should be useful to analyze the p-value.",

These researchers demonstrated that in most of the cases, xerostomia occurred before other symptoms of the disease, and the severity of this problem diminished after 15 days [5, 6] patients their first-time experiencing xerostomia in their lifetime. According to this study xerostomia was reported as one of the first symptoms in 19.6% of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection with a median onset time of 7 days (range: 4 to 7.8) before the COVID-19 diagnosis [6] . According to researches, SARS-CoV-2 uses ACE 2 receptors to enter the cells and utilizes the transmembrane serine protease Type 2 protein (TMPRSS 2) for priming [7] . The upregulation of these two receptors leads to the activation of the ribosomal pathway and the synthesis of viral RNA and proteins [8] . The ACE 2 and TMPRSS 2 receptors have a remarkable expression in the epithelial cells of salivary glands. Therefore, it seems that these glands are suitable receptors for SARS-CoV-2 and are among the first target cells of this virus and probably the virus can easily enter the salivary glands resulting in infection [8] .",

Liu et al. revealed that the SARS-CoV load was higher in saliva samples than blood specimens 48 h after intranasal viral challenge [9] . Considering the aforementioned data, virus penetration into salivary glands affects the function of these glands in the initial stages of the disease causing changes in saliva flow and components [3, 10] . One of the theories proposed for the latter alterations is the neurotropic role of SARS-CoV-2 [5] . Coronavirus could enter the CNS through intranasal and peripheral nerves. Neurones and neuroglia; neural cells that express the entry protein ACE2 can be affected by coronavirus. Therefore, even occurrence of a neurological disease is possible. Furthermore, the involvement of SARS-CoV-2 in CNS infections was underscored by the findings that made use of transgenic mouse models expressing the human ACE2, which is the cellular receptor used by the SARS-CoV-2 to infect susceptible cells. The virus enters peripheral nerves and spreads to the CNS through synaptic contacts. Sensory and autonomic innervation of parotid gland and parasympathetic innervation of submandibular glands can be affected [5] . ACE2 receptors have been found in the epithelium of taste buds and salivary glands, not only in rhesus macaques but also in humans. Salivary glands in rhesus macaques have been demonstrated to be an early target for SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV RNA has been demonstrated to be present in saliva before pulmonary lesions [11] .",

The most common medications in patients with COVID-19 include antiviral agents (remdesivir), hydroxychloroquine, anti-HIV medications (ritonavir, lopinavir) and interferons [12] . Overall, medications are the most frequent reason for xerostomia. Among the common medicines for COVID-19 treatment, lopinavir, ritonavir and interferons play a remarkable role in xerostomia. Studies showed that the xerogenic effects of some of these medications remain even after complete recovery from the disease [12] . However, we mentioned earlier that the signs of xerostomia in COVID-19 patients usually occur before other symptoms and treatment initiation and decrease gradually during the recovery period. The latter point reduces the possibility of the role of medicines in generating xerostomia. It was also notable in our study that the signs of xerostomia began simultaneously or a little after the incidence of COVID-19 symptoms in most cases (60%).",

(Epub ahead of print) future science group resultant alterations in these glands could be the most important reason for this sign. Xerostomia usually occurs a little before the common symptoms of the disease, namely fever, cough and dyspnea. Therefore, it could be hypothesized that this sign could be used for early diagnosis, quarantine and treatment of the patients. As a result, disease transmission might be prevented and the best treatment outcomes could be achieved.",
