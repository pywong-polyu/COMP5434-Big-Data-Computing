Limited and heterogeneous data from China 10 and Italy 11 initially reported a possible higher incidence of COVID-19 infection in cancer patients. A more recent meta-analysis 12 found an overall prevalence of cancer in patients with COVID-19 of 2% (3% in studies with a sample size <100), higher than expected from the non-COVID-19 population. Furthermore, patients with cancer seem to have a higher risk of severe events compared with those without cancer . 13 Even though the data are not conclusive, cancer patients are considered at high risk and multiple measures have been suggested, adapted, and recommended for treatment and follow-up. Subsequently, treatment of cancer has been impacted in an exceptionally significant way in this period, especially regarding surgery. [14] [15] [16] Surgical treatment is the cornerstone of all gynecological cancer management, especially in the initial stages. According to a study by Amodeo et al on postoperative immune function, 17 major surgery induces suppression of the cellular immune response, a circumstance that could lead to a higher likelihood of contracting the infection and a greater severity of symptoms in such cases. Based on the physiopathological data on SARS-COV-2, Bestieret al in their article suggest an increased risk of postoperative complications and mortality in infected patients . 18 During this pandemic, surgery was questioned on the basis of a greater possibility of postoperative complications, a greater risk of infection by COVID-19 after surgery due to alteration of the immune system with greater severity of infection, the use of hospital Original research resources, including staff, and the risk of exposure and contagion by COVID-19 virus for both staff and patients. Most hospitals in our region exceeded their capacities from the beginning of the pandemic and were forced by the emergent situation to cancel their surgical activity. Although some surgeries in cancer patients may be considered elective (plastic reconstruction, closure of stomata, removal of stents), most have a curative intent, and although they may be delayed without a negative effect on survival, postponing may have a negative effect on the evolution and prognosis of disease. A recent publication from the Naval Medical University in Shanghai reported on the inherent risks of delaying surgery for colorectal cancer during the COVID-19 outbreak in China. 19 In our center, we canceled elective surgery but not those with curative intent.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 376, "end": 378, "text": "12", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 660, "end": 662, "text": "13", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 979, "end": 983, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 984, "end": 988, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 989, "end": 993, "text": "[16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 1177, "end": 1179, "text": "17", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 1556, "end": 1558, "text": "18", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 2618, "end": 2620, "text": "19", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "The study showed that the possibility of postsurgical complications was not greater than in a COVID-19 free period, but our follow-up time was short and may not reflect the true rate of infection.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "COVID-19 infection was detected in only six patients, requiring cancellation of surgery.

This approach has been questioned in some reports 20 on the basis of a greater possibility of virus exposure due to the use of pneumoperitoneum and surgical smoke. This could lead to aerosol induced infection. It is understood that SARS-CoV-2 virus is transmitted by respiratory droplets with the highest risk arising in aerosol generating procedures, as intubation and extubation during surgery, and during the operation itself due to the use of energy and CO 2 insufflation. Although there is limited evidence on the specific COVID-19 risk in laparoscopic procedures, previous studies have shown the presence of other pathogens (corynebacterium, human papillomavirus, hepatitis B virus, and HIV). 21 The presence of these pathogens is not an absolute contraindication for the use of the laparoscopic approach, although a series of recommendations must be considered to avoid possible exposure to viral particles. In our center, we have incorporated many of these recommendations since the COVID-19 outbreak, such as enhanced personal protective equipment, disposable eye protection, maximal care during insufflation and desufflation, prevention of dispersion from trocars, use of laparoscopic filters to evacuate smoke, and evacuation of pneumoperitoneum using vacuum suction before removing trocars. Following these recommendations, and with the few current data, there is no evidence to assume an increased risk of COVID-19 transmission. Since SARS-CoV-2 has been found in gastrointestinal tracts or via anal swabs, the risk should cautiously be considered in the event that bowel involvement is anticipated. 22 23 The strength of this study is based on the number of cases operated on during the period of greatest incidence of the pandemic, with a low number of grade III-IV complications and no incidence of postoperative COVID-19 infection. However, it has several limitations. The number of low complexity surgeries with short hospital stays included in the study may have influenced the risk of postoperative contagion, and the fact that the PCR test before surgery was not performed in half of the patients due to low availability could have reduced the diagnosis of the infection. Nevertheless, despite the lack of PCR, it must be noted that none of our patients developed symptoms or had a positive test after surgery.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 799, "end": 801, "text": "21", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 1713, "end": 1718, "text": "22 23", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "This study, conducted in a partial COVID-19 free hospital, showed that with adequate preventive and protective measures, cancer surgery was possible and did not significantly compromise patients or healthcare workers.
