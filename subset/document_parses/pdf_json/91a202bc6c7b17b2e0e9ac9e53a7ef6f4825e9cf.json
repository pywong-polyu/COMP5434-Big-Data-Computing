The novel coronavirus was isolated from human airway epithelial cells and was named severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which is highly infectious and induces a high fatality [2] [3] [4] [5] . Nowadays, the underlying pathogenic mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 has been generally explored [6] . Similar to SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2 uses the receptors of angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE2) for viral entry process. After receptor binding, the spike (S) protein priming protease, such as cell surface transmembrane serine protease (TMPRSSs) and endosomal cathepsins, works in membrane fusion [2, 7] . However, these proteases are not prognosis predictors of COVID-19 patients, which may be significantly associated with therapeutic decision-making.",

Additionally, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein-albumin ratio (HsCAR) and low prognostic nutritional index (PNI) and the ratio of interleukin (IL)-6 to IL-10 were reported to be related to the prognosis of COVID-19 patients [9, 10] . Moreover, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) is a glycoprotein generated in colonic epitheliums in the embryonic period and has been widely used as a biomarker for tumorgenesis and progression.

Then, the principal components (PCs) with P values < 0.05 were filtered by the jackstraw analysis and were incorporated into further UMAP (uniform manifold approximation and projection) and t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding To identify the optimal cutoff point of CEA, the cyclic log-rank test was performed. And the results showed that CEA = 7.3 ng/ml was the optimal cutoff point with the most significant P value in log-rank test (A, B). Then, 12 potential significant indicators (showing prognostic values in Kaplan-Meier analysis) and two demographic information (age and gender) were incorporated into the initial Cox proportional hazard models, and the final multivariate models were constructed to confirm the effects of significant covariates in the initial models to the OS of COVID-19 patients (C). The variable of nasal catheter is integrated into a new variable named \"Mode of ventilation, \" a variable with five levels (no oxygen; oxygen with nasal canula (OWNC); oxygen through high flow nasal canula (HFNC); noninvasive ventilation (NIV); and invasive ventilation (IV)). The results suggested that patients with lower CEA had better OS (HR 0.57; 95% CI 0.354 to 0.920; P = 0.020) in multivariate model, which suggested that CEA independently prognostic indicator for COVID-19 patients (t-SNE) to identify cell subclusters (resolution = 0.50) [18] . Only the genes with |log2 fold change (FC)|> 0.5 and false discovery rate (FDR) value < 0.05 were identified as differentially expressed genes (DEGs) among cell subclusters. Feature plots and violin plots were utilized to illustrate the distribution and expression of DEGs, respectively. Additionally, scMatch [19] , singleR [20] and CellMarker [21] were used as references to define each cluster. Cell trajectory and pseudo-time analysis was performed by monocle2 [22] . Furthermore, 50 hallmark gene sets were retrieved from the Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB) version 7.1 (https:// www. gsea-msigdb. org/ gsea/ msigdb/ index. jsp) and gene set variation analysis (GSVA) algorithm was performed to absolutely quantify the activity of signaling pathways in each single cell [23, 24] . Furthermore, the CellphoneDB algorithm was used to identify the cellular communication between pneumonocyte and immune cells [25] .",

Some laboratory indicators, such as ALT (alanine aminotransferase), AST (aspartate aminotransferase), PLT (platelet), PCT (procalcitonin), HBDH (\u03b1-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase), LDH (lactate dehydrogenase), ferritin, IL-6 (interleukin 6), D-dimer, myoglobin and HsTNT (high-sensitivity troponin) did show prognostic values in univariate analyses. In order to further prove whether these laboratory indicators with significance in univariate analysis can be used as independent prognostic factors, we, respectively, incorporated these variables into the multivariate Cox regression model and conducted multivariate Cox regression analysis for 22 times (keep or remove missing values). In the cohort where missing values were removed, only the regression models, respectively, including AST, ALT, D-dimer and PLT were converged (due to the uneven distribution of some variables level and events number when removing missing values), suggesting that CEA was an independent prognostic factor in all multivariate models and both normal PLT (HR = 0.635, 95% CI (0.408 to 0.990), P = 0.045) and normal ferritin (HR = 0.094, 95% CI (0.010 to 0.860), P = 0.037) were also independent favorable factors (Additiona file 2: Supplementary material 1) compared abnormal levels. In the cohort keeping missing values, a total of 11 regression models were converged and CEA was an independent prognostic factor in all multivariate models. Additionally, patients with normal PLT (HR 0.624; 95% CI 0.406 to 0.960; P = 0.031), ferritin (HR 0.089; 95% CI 0.010 to 0.750; P = 0.026), IL \u2212 6 (HR 0.494; 95% CI 0.264 to 0.930; P = 0.028) and myoglobin (HR 0.520; 95% CI 0.303 to 0.890; P = 0.017) had better OS than patients with abnormal levels of these laboratory indicators in the multivariate models (Additiona file 3: Supplementary material 2). However, most of these laboratory indicators did not meet the requirements for inclusion in multivariate analysis [31, 32] . Inclusion of more covariates does not necessarily lead to higher accuracy, but instead to overfitting, and should be avoided. Thus, only five indicators (serum CEA, lymphocytes, neutrophils, CRP and albumin) were incorporated into the multivariate Cox model. And all these results suggested CEA as a prognostic indicator for COVID-19 patients independently.",

Additionally, dot plots summarized the results of Gene Ontology (GO) and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis. Based on GO analysis, the DEGs were associated with the neutrophil activation and degranulation (Fig. 5F ). According to KEGG analysis, the DEGs were related to protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum, phagosome, Epstein-Barr virus infection and tuberculosis (Fig. 5F ). Additionally, cell cycle analysis suggested that the developing neutrophils in COVID-19 patients' PBMCs were all engaged in the G2M and S stages (Additional file 10: Figure S6C-D) . And more extensive cellular communication analysis performed by iTALK algorithm (https:// github. com/ Coolg enome/ iTALK/) further illustrated mechanisms between the developing neutrophils and the other PBMCs (Additional file 10: Figure S6E-F) .

To further explore the underlying mechanism, we used the single-cell transcriptomics of BALF from patients with or without COVID-19, along with the scRNA-seq data of ALI and IPF mouse lungs. We found that the developing neutrophils/neutrophil progenitors can have the cross talk with type II pneumocyte via CEACAM8-CEACAM6 in COVID-19 but not ALI and IPF. The predicting biomarkers are important for clinical decision-making; thus, many efforts have been made to identify them in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. Previously, the inflammatory biomarkers (IL-6, IL-8, IL-10 and ratio of IL-6 to IL-10), patients' characteristics (age) and chest CT images (consolidation, emphysema and residual healthy lung parenchyma) have been reported to predict the prognosis of COVID-19 patients [8, 36] .

Due to the close correlation between CEA and ALI and IPF, we initially speculated that the poor prognosis of COVID-19 patients mediated by CEA might be related to ALI and IPF pathophysiologically. To validate this hypothesis, scRNA-seq data of ALI and IPF mouse lungs were also downloaded to evaluated the distribution and expression of CRGs, key receptor-ligand pair of cellular communication and potential downstream pathways. The UAMP analysis identified 18 clusters and 6 cell types in ALI mouse lungs while there were no abnormal expressions of CRGs (A, C). And the interferon response and cell proliferation signaling pathways were not significantly activated in type II pneumocytes of ALI mouse lungs (D). Similarly, abnormal expressions of CRGs were also not detected in 31 clusters and 10 cell types of IPF mouse lungs (E, G). Besides, the heatmap of GSVA also showed that the interferon response and cell proliferation signaling pathways were not activated in type II pneumocytes of IPF mouse lungs (H) [41] . And it has been reported that the major risk factors for severe COVID-19 are shared with IPF, namely increasing age, male sex and comorbidities such as hypertension and diabetes [42] . Due to the close correlation between CEA and ALI/IPF, we initially speculated that the poor prognosis of COVID-19 patients mediated by CEA might be related to ALI and IPF pathophysiologically. Because there are no natural models for IPF and ALI, the use of animal models that reproduce key known features of the disease is warranted. Direct lung infection is the leading cause of ARDS/ALI and can be modeled in mice using live pathogens and sterile models of inflammation while the bleomycin mouse model has identified many of the molecular and cellular mechanisms recognized as being important in pathogenesis of IPF [43, 44] . Therefore to validate this hypothesis, scRNA-seq data of ALI mouse lungs and IPF mouse lungs were also downloaded to evaluate the distribution and expression of CRGs, key receptor-ligand pair of cellular communication and potential downstream pathways [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] .",

The close association between respiratory epithelial damage and the release of CEA in IPF has been validated by a study based on BALF and serum measurement of CEA [50] . Acute exacerbations of IPF is pathologically manifested as diffuse acute lung injury (DALI) on the basis of pulmonary interstitial fibrosis [28] . Since COVID-19 pneumonia belongs to interstitial pneumonia and IPF was the result of the final fibrosis of interstitial pneumonia, we initially speculated that the poor prognosis of COVID-19 patients mediated by CEA might be related to ALI and IPF pathophysiologically. However, abnormal expression of CRGs was not found in both scRNA-seq samples of ALI and IPF while no developing neutrophils were annotated. Thus, abnormal expressions of CRGs in COVID-19 patients were COVID-19-specific and not related to CEA involvement in ALI and IPF.",

The results implied the potential for clinical application. However, several limitations were present in this study. First, the retrospective nature of the present study was a limitation compared with a prospective study. Secondly, the generalizability of the nomogram had not been validated externally by the multicenter data, nor had the potential mechanism of CRGs been verified by wet experiments. Third, the case number of scRNA-seq data of BALF from three patients with moderate COVID-19, six patients with severe or critical infection and three healthy controls was limited. Fourth, smokers could have increased CEA levels without any correlation with COVID-19. However, smoking status was unknown for more than 25% of the patients. Any conclusion seems therefore debatable. Due to the limited number of smoking patients in this study (11/300) and the large number of patients with unknown smoking status (79/300), the relationship between smoking status and CEA in COVID-19 patients needs to be further studied. Last but not least, the limitation of sample size may contribute to the major bias of this study. Subsequent ",

The significant prognostic factors in multivariate Cox model were marked with asterisks (*) in the nomogram (*: P < 0.05; **: P < 0.01).

As smokers or patients with specific malignancies could have increased CEA levels without any correlation with COVID-19, all patients with primary malignancy were excluded from the study. Furthermore, in order to identify the association between CEA levels and smoking, two subgroup Cox proportional hazard regression models including smoking status (keep or remove missing values) were constructed, suggesting that the CEA level (HR 0.547; 95% CI 0.318 to 0.940; P = 0.037) (remove missing values) (HR 0.620; 95% CI 0.384 to 0.990; P = 0.048) (keep missing values) was still an independent prognostic indicator for COVID-19 patients.Additional file 5. Figure S1 : Model diagnosis of prognostic nomogram. The calibration curve and time-related ROC suggested acceptable calibration and discrimination of the nomogram (A-B). Besides, the risk score (RS) was calculated by the formula generated by the multivariate Cox model. The scatter plot (C) and risk curve (D) of the model demonstrated the RS distribution based on risk score of each patient. And the residual distribution of the multivariate model was accessed by the residual plot (E). Additionally, the results of Kaplan-Meier analysis of 17 laboratory values with more than 20% missing data were illustrated by survival curves (F). Additional file 6. Figure S2 : Subgroup analysis between CEA and smoking status. The CRG expression levels were retrieved from the RNA-seq data of Lung Squamous Cell Carcinoma (LUSC) available from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). The results of rank-sum tests showed that CEA levels in both the serum of COVID-19 patients (A) and the tissues of lung cancer (B-C) were significantly higher in smokers than in non-smokers. Therefore, smoking status of patients should be considered when CEA was considered as a prognostic indicator. Additional file 7. Figure S3 : Kaplan-Meier curve evaluating the prognostic value of the mode of ventilation. To further evaluate the prognostic value of mode of ventilation, the Kaplan-Meier analysis was performed. The results suggested that mode of ventilation was significantly associated with the prognosis of COVID-19 patients (P < 0.001).Additional file 8.
