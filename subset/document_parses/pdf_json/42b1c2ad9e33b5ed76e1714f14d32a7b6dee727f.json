            "text": "Acyclic nucleoside phosphonates (ANPs), such as (R)-PMPA [9-[9(R)-2-(phosphonomethoxy)propyl]adenine, 1] and PMEA [9-[2-(phosphonomethoxy)ethyl] adenine, 2] discovered by A. Hol\u00fd and E. De Clercq in 1986, led to a new family of nucleotide analogs which has attracted considerable attention, [1] [2] [3] [4] . In order to improve the oral absorption of these phosphonate analogs, ANPs are delivered as prodrugs [bis(POC)-PMPA (3) or bis(POM)-PMEA (4)]; prodrug moiety [5] has previously focused on acyloxyalkylester (pivaloyloxymethyl, POM) [6, 7] , or ((isopropyloxycarbonyl-oxymethyl)-ester, POC) [8] , alkoxyalkyl groups (hexadecyloxypropyl, HDP) [9] , and more recently on phosphonoamidates (ProTides) [10, 11] . Currently, several ANP prodrugs (alone or in combination) are FDA-approved drugs against DNA and RNA viruses. In our search for antiviral compounds, we have discovered a new class of acyclic nucleoside phosphonates based on a 4phosphono-but-2-en-1-yl skeleton, with the double bond having trans stereochemistry [12] [13] [14] . We have shown that this modification allows for the mimicry of the three-dimensional geometry provided by the backbone of PMEA, PMPA, and CDV ((S)-1-[3-hydroxy-2-(phosphonylmethoxy)propyl]cytosine) while maintaining an electronic contribution similar to that brought by the oxygen atom [12] . Our group has published a series of bis(POM)-(1,4disubstituted-1,2,3-triazol)-(E)-but-2 -enyl nucleoside phosphonates [15] . Among them, the Among them, the compound 5 exhibits significant potency against human hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections at 10 \u03bcM (95% of inhibition) meanwhile our synthesized bis(POC)-(E)-2-methyl-but-2-enylguanine 6 (unpublished data) showed antiviral activity against hepatitis B virus (HBV) with an EC50 of 8.5 \u03bcM without significant cytotoxicity ( Figure 1 ). For nucleosides, it appears that chemical alterations (such as a methyl group at 2\u2032 position) at the sugar (or acyclic side-chain) moiety or at the heterocycle such as 1,2,3triazoles [16] often lead to marked differences in antiviral activity. Based on these findings and on our data for compounds 5 and 6, we were interested in the synthesis of hitherto unknown (1,4-disubstituted-1,2,3-triazol)-(E)-2-methyl-but-2-enyl nucleosides phosphonate prodrugs and we wish to compare the impact of bis(POC) with the mixed HDP/POC biolabile moiety on the antiviral activity. All compounds were evaluated against hepatitis B virus (HBV), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) and the newly detected severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).",

The desired compound 9 was obtained in an excellent 94% yield with only E-isomer; no trace of Z-isomer was detected (NOESY NMR, see Supplementary Materials). Compound 9 was converted to the corresponding mesylate and the obtained sulfone was used directly in the next step without further purification. The introduction of the azido group on the mesylated compound was realized with sodium azide in DMF at room temperature for 5 h to afford compound 10 in excellent 93% yield. For nucleosides, it appears that chemical alterations (such as a methyl group at 2 position) at the sugar (or acyclic side-chain) moiety or at the heterocycle such as 1,2,3triazoles [16] often lead to marked differences in antiviral activity. Based on these findings and on our data for compounds 5 and 6, we were interested in the synthesis of hitherto unknown (1,4-disubstituted-1,2,3-triazol)-(E)-2-methyl-but-2-enyl nucleosides phosphonate prodrugs and we wish to compare the impact of bis(POC) with the mixed HDP/POC biolabile moiety on the antiviral activity.

We can speculate that the hydrophobic pocket (formed by A87, F88, P177, L180, and M2) found in the rear of the RT dNTP binding site of HBV could interact with hydrophobic aryl residues through donor atom-\u03c0 interaction [21] .",

Compounds were visualized by UV irradiation and/or spraying with sulfuric acid (H 2 SO 4 5% in ethanol) stain followed by charring at average 150 \u2022 C. Flash column chromatography was performed on silica gel 60 M (0.040-0.063 mm, E. Merck). The infrared spectra were measured with the Perkin-Elmer Spectrometer. The 1 H and 13 C NMR spectra were recorded on the BrukerAvance DPX 250 or BrukerAvance 400 Spectrometer (Bruker, Champs sur Marne, France). Chemical shifts are given in ppm and are referenced to the deuterated solvent signal or to TMS as internal standard and multiplicities are reported as s (singlet), d (doublet), t (triplet), q (quartet) and m (multiplet). Carbon multiplicities were assigned by distortionless enhancement by polarization transfer (DEPT) experiments. 1 H and 13 C signals were attributed on the basis of H-H and H-C correlations. High resolution mass spectra were performed on a Bruker Q-TOF MaXis spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany) by the \"F\u00e9d\u00e9ration de Recherche\" ICOA/CBM (FR2708) platform. LC-MS data were acquired on a Thermo-Fisher UHPLC-MSQ system equipped with an electron spray ionization source (ESI). The temperature of the source was maintained at 350 \u2022 C. Initially, the cone voltage was set at 35 V and after 5 min was increased to 75 V. In full scan mode, data were acquired between 100 and 1000 m/z in the positive mode with a 1.00 s scan time. In addition, a UV detection was performed with a diode array detector at three wavelengths 273, 254 and 290 nm, respectively. A water/methanol (70%/30%) solution mixture with 0.1% formic acid was used as the mobile phase. The composition of the mobile phase was increased to 100% methanol with 0.1% formic acid with a 7% ramp. The flow rate was set at 0.300 mL min \u22121 . Samples diluted in the mobile phase were injected (3 \u00b5L) on a C18 column (X-terra, Waters), with a 2.1 mm internal diameter, and 100 mm length, and placed into an oven at 40 \u2022 C. The electronic extraction of ions was performed and the subsequent areas under the corresponding chromatographic peaks determined. The compounds' name follows the IUPAC recommendations.",

The next day, four 2-fold serial dilutions of compounds (20 \u00b5M to 2.5 \u00b5M, in duplicate) were added to the cells (25 \u00b5L/well, in the assay medium) as well as two internal well controls of viral inhibition corresponding to the addition of 10 \u00b5M of Remdesivir (BLDpharm, Hyderabad, India). Three virus control wells were supplemented with 25 \u00b5L of assay medium (positive controls hereafter named vc) and three cell control wells were supplemented with 50 \u00b5L of the medium (negative controls, hereafter named nc). After 15 min, 25 \u00b5L of a virus mix diluted in 2.5% FCS-containing medium was added to the wells at MOI 0.002. Three days after infection, the cell supernatant media was discarded and CellTiter-Blue \u00ae reagent (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) was added following the manufacturer's instructions. Plates were incubated for 2 h prior to recording the fluorescence (560/590 nm) with a Tecan Infinite 200Pro machine. From the measured OD 590nm , the inhibition percentage was calculated as follows: ((OD 590nm value-mean OD 590nm value of vc)/(mean OD 590nm of nc-mean OD 590nm value of vc))*100. All data obtained were analyzed using GraphPad Prism 7 software (Graph pad software).",
