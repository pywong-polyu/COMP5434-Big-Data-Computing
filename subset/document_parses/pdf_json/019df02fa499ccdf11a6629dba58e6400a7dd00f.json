            "text": "The current contagious pandemic of the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 named SARS-CoV-2, is a viral pneumonia and a threat to global public health [1, 2] . According to the current situational report (https://www.worldometers.info/ coronavirus/), released on 22 July 2021, the SARS-CoV-2 has already affected over 179 million people across the world, including 396,758 confirmed cases in Kingdom Saudi Arabia with 7691 deaths. The SARS-CoV2 is a single-stranded positive-sense RNA genome of size 29.7 kb [3] . Structurally, it was composed of Spike glycoprotein (S), Envelope protein (E), Membrane protein (M) and Nucleocapsid protein (N). Envelope (E) protein is essential to release the virus, Membrane (M) protein by increasing the membrane curvature, promotes the viral assembly; Nucleocapsid (N) protein is interferon (IFN) antagonistic and supports viral replication. Hemagglutinin esterase (HE) and Helicase (H) proteins, and nonstructural proteins (NSP) which include proteases, papain-like proteases (PL pro or NSP3) and 3C-like protease (M pro or NSP5), and Replicase proteins [4] [5] [6] . The envelope and nucleocapsid proteins of SARS-CoV-2 are two evolutionarily conserved regions, with sequence identities of 96% and 89.6%, respectively [7] . M pro and PL pro play significant roles in the post-translational modification of the two replicase polyproteins, pp1a and pp1ab [8, 9] . M pro display a central role in proteolysis, viral replication processes, transcriptional processes and is essential for the life cycle of the virus [10] . PL pro is essential for replication/transcription complex (RTC) formation and is responsible for release of NSP1, NSP2 and NSP3 from the N-terminal region of pp1a and 1ab [11] . Their inhibition can block these processes and prevent the viral infection. NSP15 protein also acts as an endoribonuclease and preferentially cleaves 3 of uridylates through a ribonuclease A (RNase A)-like mechanism and also facilitates viral replication and transcription [10] . As a part of the body's immune response, inflammation is a crucial parameter that may be taken into account to reduce infection, limit viral replication and transmission. NF-\u03baB-inducing kinase (NIK), Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), phospholipase A2 (PLA2) and interleukin-1 receptor associated kinase 4 (IRAK-4) are important druggable targets involved in SARS-CoV-2 induced inflammatory response and can be used to screen anti-inflammatory molecules. In fact, NIK activates NF-\u03baB2 by promoting proteolytic processing and the generation of NF-\u03baB transcription of the targeted gene, also known to regulates both inflammation-induced and tumor-associated angiogenesis [12] . COX-2 catalyze the biosynthesis of prostaglandins, prostacylins and thromboxanes, from arachidonic acid mostly involved in pathological conditions such as inflammation, pain and fever [11] . PLA2 enzymes are required to increase the level of arachidonic acid for metabolism and biosynthesis of eicosanoid under physiological condition as well as in inflammatory cell activation [11] . Interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 4 (IRAK-4) plays a pivotal role in signaling cascades associated with the immune and inflammatory diseases, and may be an effective therapeutic target for various diseases associated with deregulated inflammation [11] .",

To study the conformational stability of the Tomatidine-protein complex and its changes, we have simulated the systems up to 100 ns.

It is believed that the lower the RMSD value throughout the simulation, shows higher stability of the protein-ligand complex. Conversely, greater the RMSD value, reveals the less stable the protein-ligand complex. For protein biomolecules, fluctuations in the lower RMSD range are perfectly acceptable.

Lower hydrophobicity results in a decrease in the metabolism of compounds and high absorption. Pharmacokinetic data showed that both leads were permeators of the blood brain barrier and skin with high gastrointestinal absorption meaning their high absorbance potential. It is well known that cytochrome P450s can regulate the metabolism of various drugs. Tomatidine and patchouli alcohol were found to be no inhibitors of all cytochrome P450 isoforms CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9 (except for PA), CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 which are the main players in Phase I metabolism. CYP3A4 as major enzyme system known to acts on lipophilic substrates and recognized to be responsible for the metabolism of about 60% of xenobiotics including drugs, carcinogens, steroids and eicosanoids. Both the leads exhibited negative results on Ames mutagenesis and therefore cannot be considered as a mutagenic agent.

As can be seen, tomatidine predicts 42% family AG coupled receptor, 16% enzyme, 16% kinase and 2% protease while, patchouli alcohol has 16% enzyme and 8% protease, as targets. Overall, the obtained results highlighted the effectiveness of both tomatidine and patchouli alcohol as anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents targeting papain-like proteases (PLpro), 3Clike protease (Mpro) and NSP15 proteins. In fact, tomatidine has been demonstrated to inhibit the production of new Dengue virus particles [31] . More recently, Troost and colleagues [27] reported that this akkaloid exhibited antiviral activity against chikungunya virus by decreasing the number of infected cells and acted at a post-entry step of the virus replication cycle. It has also been elucidated that tomatidine inhibits porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) by blocking 3CL protease activity in infected cells, and consequently PEDV replication [32] . Additionally, this molecule is active against Sunnhemp Rossette virus and Tobacco mosaic, and do not affect the replication of herpes simplex virus, human respiratory syncytial and influenza virus [33] [34] [35] [36] . In 2021, Vergoten and Baily [37] studied the in silico interaction of four compounds including tomatidine, with Coronavirus 3Clike protease of PEDV (3CLpro) and (SARS-CoV-2)-main protease (Mpro).

The system was neutralized by adding counter-ions (Na + and Cl -) at random, and an isosmotic state was maintained by adding 0.15 M NaCl. Using OPLS 2005 force field parameters as the default protocol associated with Desmond, the solvated built system was minimised and relaxed [60] [61] [62] . MD simulations were performed using an isothermal, isobaric ensemble (NPT) with a temperature of 300 K, pressure of 1 atm and a 200 ps thermostat relaxation period. A total of 100 ns simulations were run, during which 1000 trajectories were recorded. Finally, the Simulation Interaction Diagram (SID) tool was used to examine the MD simulation trajectory [63] [64] [65] .

In addition, Tomatidine was found to be potentially bind sufficiently to 3CLpro, NSP15 and human COX-2. To further validate the stability of a potential inhibitor tomatidine, a MD simulation study was performed for 100 ns. The MD simulation result revealed significant stability of test compound tomatidine in the active site of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro, NSP15 and human COX-2, and exhibited good interactions with the surrounded amino acid residues. The post dynamic MM-GBSA analysis of the compound tomatidine showed significant binding affinity with its selected target. Moreover, much research is still required for the effectiveness of tomatidine in human clinical trials. ",

According to the 3CLpro RMSF plot, the RMSF value of protein backbone residues is in the range of 0.4 \u00c5 to 4.5 \u00c5 in the catalytic domain, showing high fluctuation in C-and N-terminal in contrast to other regions of the protein. The RMSF of most of the amino acid residues were within 1.6 \u00c5 and only Tyr154 show little bit higher fluctuation at 1.85 \u00c5 (",
