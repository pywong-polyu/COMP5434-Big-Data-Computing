Clinical trials are embedded in the TARGet Kids! cohort study. Participating children who meet clinical trial eligibility criteria (which varies by trial) are provided opportunities to participate if interested. At select pediatric and family medicine primary care practices in Toronto, Canada which were selected based on interest from primary healthcare providers, families are approached to participate in TARGet Kids! during regularly scheduled well-child visits (up to 15 visits in the first 10 years of life). At each visit, participating families provide a blood sample and information about their growth (height, weight, head and waist circumference), lifestyle (physical activity and sleep habits), development (temperament and behaviour), and nutrition.",

It is important that new TARGet Kids! health care interventions and data collection tools are feasible, appropriate and fit into daily life to ensure families feel comfortable participating in research and minimize measurement error. PACT members have informed study feasibility by providing their opinions and suggestions about measurement tools such as questionnaires, smartphone data capture, wearable technologies, and blood spot serology testing for COVID-19. This valuable information, captured early in research planning, also holds potential to improve resource efficiency in research. In one instance, parents indicated they would not be comfortable using a smartphone photo data capture tool for their children, which allowed time and resources to be re-directed to other measurement options.",

            "text": "Institutional buy-in with engaging patients in the research process remains an ongoing challenge. For example, research ethics committees (RECs) tend to be reluctant to take recommendations from patient representatives as evidence [4] . Similarly, funders may not provide compensation for the time patient representatives devote to engaging with researchers, which sends mixed messages about the importance of patient engagement in health research. In Canada, the CIHR SPOR is actively advocating for improved communication between researchers and RECs about patient engagement in research, and increased funding opportunities for patient-engaged research [4] . Ensuring that the PACT is representative of the diverse populations that we serve, including ethnic minority groups, households experiencing poverty, and mothers and fathers has also been challenging. While PACT members represent many different neighbourhoods across Toronto, there is room to improve the sociodemographic diversity of the team. To help us strengthen our parent partnership and expand our reach, we are in the process of establishing a diversity framework to champion issues related to equity and inclusion. We are also exploring creative ways to engage fathers, through incentives such as 'fathers only' meetings where PACT members who are mothers provide a chance for their partners to attend while they care for children, or alternating mothers and fathers who attend meetings. Engaging children who participate in TARGet Kids! holds possibility for understanding child perspectives about health research. Evidence-based approaches and best practices are not yet available for engaging children as young as those in the TARGet Kids! cohort study, but we look forward to future developments in this area. Disruption to engagement during the COVID-19 pandemic, which caused significant delays in funding decisions, REC review timelines, and changes to recruitment strategies could have been highly challenging. Fortunately, some of these impacts were minimised because of the dedication of PACT members who recognised the increased value and importance of the child health research during this time. The COVID-19 pandemic has also made evaluation of our approach to patient engagement a challenge, but we are in the midst of conducting individual interviews with PACT members to inform improvements in our processes. Finally, it has been challenging to create a compensation policy which fits everyone's needs and preferences. Development of a parent compensation policy is underway, which will reflect the CIHR guidelines for paying partners in research [12] .",
