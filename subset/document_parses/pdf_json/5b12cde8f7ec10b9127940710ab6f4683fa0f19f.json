This will reduce the wait time and also reduce the number of people in the clinic complying with social distancing norms.

The key to a successful dental practice would be considering every patient to be an asymptomatic carrier and treating him accordingly with the standard operating protocols.",

Mild anxiety is natural and fosters preventive and safeguarding behaviour. The silver lining in this situation being every time there's a crisis, mankind is known to adapt and innovate. As endodontists, there is a moral obligation of relieving the patients of the pain. There exists a necessity to follow the proper infection protocol and practice dentistry safely. Emergency and elective procedures should be differentiated. Increasing the knowledge among the dentists, regarding the infection control procedures, reduce the levels of anxiety, hence creating a positive change in their attitudes towards providing dental care to patients.",
