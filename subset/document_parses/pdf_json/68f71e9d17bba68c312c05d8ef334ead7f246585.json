In the last decade, notable actions are the Program for Valorization of Primary Care (PROVAB), aimed at doctors, nurses and dentists, and the Program More Doctors for Brazil (PMM), aimed at the medical profession. Both focus on providing professionals for remote and vulnerable areas 8 . However, contrary to all the aforementioned stimuli, growing austerity policies in Brazil are causing the defunding of the health system. Given this situation, it is important to investigate the admission of PRMS alumni into the SUS, which would mean a return on the investment in this type of education for society. The subject becomes especially relevant due to the lack of studies in this line, or studies showing that training in PMRS is an advantage for being admitted into the SUS. Therefore, given the situation presented, the objective of this study was to investigate the admission of alumni from PRMS aimed at PHC in the labor market, especially in the SUS, and also to identify possible associated factors.",

Of all the participants, 80.2% declared that they have started working, with or without a connection to the SUS.

Comparing the admission into the SUS amongst the Brazilian regions, we find a higher admission rate in the Southeast and Northeast regions, as both have higher rates than the national rate (Table 1 ). We also highlight that, of the total number of participants who reported admission into the SUS (n = 175), 35.4% (n = 62) also pursue activities in other services (or activities), with no connection to the SUS.",

Regarding admission into the SUS (Table 2) , we noted a significant association to this outcome, both in the bivariate analysis and the multiple model, of professions that make up the Reference Team (adjusted PR = 1.87; 95% CI 1.54-2.28) and admission into stricto sensu graduate school. The latter was seen as a factor that reduces the frequency of the outcome (adjusted PR = 0.77; 95% CI 0.61-0.97). If these two conditions are kept, the model predicts an increase in the estimated frequency of the outcome to 76%. Table 3 presents the characteristics of admission into the SUS. In this regard, data show that although alumni undergo formal selection processes in most cases, part of them perform professional activities in the SUS with unstable work ties, such as temporary contracts (27.2%) and scholarships (8.1%). The most frequent manner of admission was admission into primary care alone (47.4%), although part of the participants (15%) had been admitted into more than one context. There is also a predominance of activities (or actions) in health care (84.9%) and health management (18.6%).

Another important point that we highlight is the relevant perception of the contribution of PHC residency programs to the performance of SUS activities. It was shown that almost half of the alumni studied have joined the SUS, but the findings of this study reinforce the need to propose a policy of valorization of the PRMS in the recruitment process for working in the SUS.",
