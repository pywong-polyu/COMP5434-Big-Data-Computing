It produced a tsunami that impacted coastal communities, ground shaking that was locally amplified in some areas and that led to collapse of structures with 118 fatalities in both Greece and Turkey, and wide-ranging geotechnical effects including rockfalls, landsliding, and liquefaction. As a result of the global COVID-19 pandemic, the reconnaissance of this event did not involve the deployment of international teams, as would be typical for an event of this size. Instead, following initial deployments of separate Greek and Turkish teams, the reconnaissance and documentation efforts were managed in a coordinated manner with the assistance of international partners. This coordination ultimately produced a multi-agency joint report published on the 2-month anniversary of the earthquake, and this special issue. This paper provides an overview of the reconnaissance activities undertaken to document the effects of this important event and summarizes key lessons spanning topic areas from seismology to emergency response.",

Rather, reconnaissance was organized independently by groups in Greece (the Hellenic Association of Earthquake Engineering, HAEE/ETAM) and Turkey (Earthquake Engineering Association of Turkey and the Earthquake Foundation of Turkey, EEAT/EFT). HAEE/ETAM mobilized a 12-member team to Samos Island and neighboring islands in two successive missions. EEAT/EFT mobilized teams to affected regions of the Aegean coast, with the main focus being the highly impacted city of Izmir. Cetin et al. (2020) While these reconnaissance missions were underway, discussions began to take place between HAEE/ETAM and EEAT/EFT, which was facilitated and encouraged by USbased international organizations (Earthquake Engineering Research Institute, EERI, and Geotechnical Extreme Events Reconnaissance Association, GEER). The information exchange led to a mutual understanding that the impacts of this significant event could only be captured in depth by mobilizing scientists on both sides of the fault, while integrating data and interpreting field evidence collectively. The outcomes of this coordinated work include a joint report ), a joint webinar organized by the collaborating scientific entities on 30 January 2021, and this special volume.",

Kalligeris et al. (2021) describe the tsunami as a sequence of sea level lowering and surge, which they document from post-event reconnaissance and eyewitness reports and videos. Due to short distances between the source and affected cities, wave travel times were relatively short for the affected coastal locations (10-30 min), challenging the ability of tsunami warning systems to alert the public, and contributing to substantial property losses and causing one fatality.",

Two of the Greek instruments were located in the near-fault region, about 10 km from the fault rupture plane, and provided the strongest recordings (PGA of approximately 0.23 g, PGV of approximately 22 cm/s). Overall levels of ground shaking, and their variation with distance, are consistent with expectation from global and regional ground motion models, and reinforce previous findings of relatively fast regional anelastic attenuation effects. The intensity of ground shaking was near design levels in Samos Island (design PGA being 0.24 g), but well below design levels for reference rock conditions in the Anatolian coastal regions due to large source-site distances (30-70 km). Where site conditions were favorable (rock or shallow stiff soils), these ground motions did not damage structures. However, pronounced site effects locally amplified ground shaking at site frequencies near 0.7-1.6 Hz throughout the Izmir Bay region for both stiff and soft soil sites. This amplification was particularly pronounced on soft soils in the Bayrakli district, which led to significant structural damage . Cetin et al. (2021) also document an apparent localization of site amplification (possibly from surface topography and bedrock morphology) on Samos Island at Ano Vathy suggested by damage concentration in lowrise buildings. Ziotopoulou et al. (2021) show that the earthquake produced isolated incidents of rockfalls and landslides, mainly in the northern part of Samos Island. They document these ground failures, as well as several \"no-ground failure\" case histories in Anatolia, where liquefaction was anticipated given the poor geotechnical conditions and high groundwater levels. Liquefaction was observed in different parts of Samos Island. Ports on the north side of Samos Island were damaged by displacements/rotations of quay walls towards the water, pavement cracks and backfill settlements behind the walls, and some signs of ejecta associated with liquefaction. The source of these movements (soil liquefaction, foundation deformations from wall inertial response) remains under investigation. On the Anatolian coast, despite tsunami-induced damage in port facilities, no geotechnical engineering related permanent ground deformations or failures of quay walls were observed.",

Vintzileou et al. (2021) document damage that occurred to these structures, although collapses were rare and the performance, particularly to buildings that were compliant to the codes issued after 1985, was generally good and consistent with expectation for the level of shaking.

Structures of all types performed well in most of Izmir, with the notable exception of the Bayrakli district, which has soft soil conditions that amplified ground shaking in the 0.6-1.5 s period range . As described by , structures in this same period range (7 to 10 stories) experienced much higher demands than what was typical in Izmir. Even though these demands were below the levels of design spectra in place at the time of structural design, they nonetheless produced a series of collapses and appurtenant loss of life (116 fatalities), suggesting the structural performance is below the level that would be expected, possibly because of design and/or construction process deficiencies. Based on this experience, argue that future earthquakes will produce strong shaking over a wider frequency range, which may cause many more structures to experience damage. This is an important observation that applies to all metropolitan cities in Southeast Europe and the Balkans (including Greece). As such, retrofit/replacement campaigns are needed to address this risk, including policies that provide financial incentives to property owners for the strengthening of structures to achieve enhanced performance (e.g., SismaBonus framework in Italy; Ministry Decree no. 58 28/02/2017). Further penetration of earthquake insurance is also important for loss mitigation, particularly in Greece, given that in Izmit the number of insured buildings was quite high.",
