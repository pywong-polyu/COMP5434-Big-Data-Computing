These retractions have created doubts in the minds of physicians and physician-scientists on therapeutic usages for Corona Virus Disease -2019 (COVID-19) and the tremendous pressure placed on health care providers to find definitive preventive and treatment strategies. Recently we also published a Systematic Review titled \"Does Adding of Hydroxychloroquine to the Standard Care Provide any Benefit in Reducing the Mortality among COVID-19 Patients?: a Systematic Review for the Journal of Neuroimmune Pharmacology\" ). Our primary aim was to search out whether hydroxychloroquine would reduce the mortality of the Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. We performed the secondary analysis of mortality data from both non randomized controlled trial and retrospective observational studies available in the public domain.",

To meet the ethical standards of publications, we herein share data extraction sheet (Supplementary File 1) and ReVMan software file (Supplementary File 2) of the analyses performed. We also want to state that the findings of our systematic review are preliminary and await further confirmatory data sets. It should only be interpreted in the lights of such limitations.",
