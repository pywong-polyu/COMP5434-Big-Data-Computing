            "text": "Background The best policy to follow when nursing homes are massively hit by SARS-CoV2 is unclear. Aim To describe COVID-19 containment in a nursing home transformed into a caring center. Methods Physicians and nurses were recruited. The facility was reorganized and connected with the laboratory of the reference hospital. Ultrasound was used to diagnose pneumonia. Patients needing intensive care were transferred to the reference hospital. Hydroxychloroquine/azithromycin/enoxaparin were used initially, while amiodarone/enoxaparin were used at a later phase. Under both regimens, methylprednisolone was added for severe cases. Prophylaxis was done with hydroxychloroquine initially and then with amiodarone. Period covered: March 22-July 31, 2020. Results The facility was reorganized in two days. Ninety-two guests of the 121 (76%) and 25 personnel of 118 (21.1%) became swab test positive. Seven swab test negative patients who developed symptoms were considered to have COVID-19. Twenty-seven patients died, 23 swab test positive, 5 of whom after full recovery. Four patients needing intensive care were transferred (3 died). Mortality, peaking in April 2020, was correlated with symptoms, comorbidities, dyspnea, fatigue, stupor/coma, high neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio, C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, pro-calcitonin, and high oxygen need (p \u2264 0.001 for all). Among swab-positive staff, 3 had pneumonia and recovered. Although no comparison could be made between different treatment and prophylaxis strategies, potentially useful suggestions emerged. Mortality compared well with that of nursing homes of the same area not transformed into care centers. Conclusion Nursing homes massively hit by SARS-CoV-2 can become caring centers for patients not needing intensive care.",

Furthermore, the categorization used (no anomalies, B lines, lung densities) did not capture the transition from few to many B lines or extension of densities. On the whole, we endorse the use of chest echography, especially when chest X-ray and CT are not available. Indeed in 11 patients with symptoms and negative swab test, a diagnosis of pneumonia by lung ultrasound prompted isolation days in advance of the emergence of swab test positivity.",

The second mechanism, pH-independent, is mediated by the plasma-membrane-resident serine protease TMPRSS2, is present on cells of the respiratory epithelium and is insensitive to the action of cationic drugs [20] .

Amiodarone is a cathionic drug that accumulates in the lumen of organelles with an acidic interior and increases lumenal pH similarly to hydroxychloroquine, a property that explains its interference with the processing of Ebola virus spike protein [7] . Furthermore, amiodarone inhibits SARS-CoV-1 infection acting after the delivery of the viral genome into the cytoplasm of the target cell, a property not known for hydroxychloroquine [8] . Finally, amiodarone inhibits the expression of tissue factor by endothelial cells and has displayed antithrombotic activity in an animal model of arterial damage [8] . Amiodarone dosage was chosen to reach blood concentrations close to those active in vitro (5-10 \u03bcmolar). Knowing that amiodarone has a narrow therapeutic window, we checked QT interval and amiodarone serum levels.",
