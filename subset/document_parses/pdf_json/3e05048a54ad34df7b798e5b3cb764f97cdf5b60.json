Persistent inflammation with increased levels of circulating pro-inflammatory tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-a) is negatively associated with rehabilitation outcome in children with CP. Because of the crosstalk between innate and adaptive immunity, we investigated the effect of CP and rehabilitation exercises on the adaptive immune system in children with CP by measuring the levels of CD3 \u00fe , CD4 \u00fe , CD8 \u00fe \u0422-cells, and CD22 \u00fe B-cells and the levels of immunoglobulins. Children with CP had higher levels of CD3 \u00fe , CD4 \u00fe , CD8 \u00fe \u0422-cells, and CD22 \u00fe B-cells compared to healthy children, and the rehabilitation exercise programs produced better outcomes in terms of increased gains in motor function at an earlier age. Rehabilitation exercises performed over a month resulted in significantly decreased levels of IgA in serum and reduced numbers of B-lymphocytes and reduced IgM levels. Our study suggests that rehabilitation programs with a focus on neuroplasticity and physical exercises in children with CP can reduce both cellular and humoral immune responses.",

            "text": "Cerebral palsy (CP) is a lifelong physical disability as a consequence of upper motor neuron impairment, and it affects 1.5-2.5 children per 1000 live births with an estimated prevalence of 17 million people globally (Graham et al., 2016) . CP imposes a huge financial burden on both parents and society. In the US, the estimated total lifetime cost per CP patient was $1.2 million in 2004, and approximately the same lifetime cost was reported in Denmark in 2009 (Tonmukayakul et al., 2018) . CP manifests with features of movement disorders due to non-progressive brain lesions during the antenatal, perinatal, or early postnatal period. It is predominantly spastic motor forms of CP that are encountered in clinical practice, and the implications of spasticity include gait disturbances and fatigue . There are currently no indications that lifespan is affected in adults with mild to moderate CP (Peterson et al., 2012) . Morbidity and even the mortality of children with CP are primarily due to recurrent and chronic respiratory infections (Proesmans, 2016; Seddon and Khan, 2003) . The complex interplay between acknowledged risk factors such as aspiration, insufficient cough, upper airway obstruction, and progressive kyphoscoliosis heightens the risk of hospital admissions due to chest infection. Thus, chest physiotherapy is recommended to children with CP to reduce the severity of chest infection and to prevent the development of complications (The Royal Children's Hospital Melbourne, 2005) . Very little is known about the extent to which the immune system is engaged in patients with CP, but it seems that these children carry genes that up-regulate the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines in response to various unfavorable factors such as intra-amniotic infection and preterm birth (Gibson et al., 2006) . Moreover, Wu and Li (2015) found 2-fold increased levels of pro-inflammatory TNF-a in children with CP and suggested that inflammation may persist later in life reflecting the reconstruction of cerebral function after birth. There are also reports of increased IL-6 levels in patients with CP (Bi et al., 2014; Pingel et al., 2019) .",

The main approach to managing this motor disability is rehabilitation with a primary goal of reducing secondary musculoskeletal deformity rather than treating the primary central neurological deficit ( _ I\u00e7a gas\u0131o glu et al., 2015; Reid et al., 2010) . The motor performance of CP patients is usually evaluated using the Gross Motor Function Measure-88 scale (GMFM-88), a recognized standardized test that has been used since 1993 and has been shown to be both a sensitive and reliable examination scale (Russell et al., 1993) . Another major focus of research is pro-inflammatory dysregulation in infants with subsequent development of CP due to cytokine regulatory polymorphism, especially TNF-a (Gabriel et al., 2016; Gibson et al., 2006) . A clinical study demonstrated the benefit of bone marrow mononuclear cell transplantationi.e. a mixture of hematopoietic stem cells, mesenchymal stem cells, endothelial progenitor cells, macrophage, and lymphocyteson the efficacy of rehabilitation in children with CP, and this effect was hypothesized to be through a reduction in inflammation (Sharma et al., 2015) . In contrast, little is known about the effect of rehabilitation on the adaptive immune system in children with CP.",

The essential advantage of the proposed method is a comprehensive scientific database of reduced associated adverse health outcomes in children with CP from inactive lifestyles (Graham et al., 2016) .",

This is a well-established diagnostic method for immunologic evaluation in Ukraine and has been used in research by Duda and Kotsyubaylo (2016) and by Hruzevskyi et al. (2021) . A sheep erythrocyte assay is used to quantify human T-and B-cells by measuring number of rosettes. Rosette is a lymphocyte (expressing specific CD) interacting with three or more sheep erythrocytes coated with monoclonal antibodies (either anti-CD3, anti-CD4, anti-CD8 or anti-CD22). This is a modification of original sheep erythrocyte assay where T-cells were quantified by measuring number of rosettes created by interaction of CD58 (expressed on sheep erythrocyte) and CD2 (expressed on T-cells). Unlike monoclonal IgG -cluster of differentiation interaction, rosettes due to CD58 -CD2 interaction are temperature dependent, i.e. they disintegrate at 37 C (Jondal et al., 1972) . Thus, the incubation for 40 min at 37 C allows to control for rosette formation due to CD58 -CD2 interaction. First, four suspensions of sheep erythrocyte coated with monoclonal antibodies against CD3, CD4, CD8, or CD22 were collected. Next, a leukocyte suspension was prepared. Blood was taken from a vein and collected in a test tube with 200-250 U/mL heparin. A total of 3 ml of blood was collected for each sample. Lymphocytes were separated from other blood cells by centrifugation at a gradient density of 1.077. Harvested cells (lymphocytes) were washed two or three times in saline with a pH of 7.2-7.4. In order to obtain a representative number of cells for quantification, the desired concentration was 20 cells in a large square of the Goryaev chamber. Suspensions of sheep erythrocytes were resuspended without foaming. A total of 50 \u03bcL of sheep erythrocytes coated with anti-CD3 monoclonal antibodies per sample were transferred to a sterile test tube, and 50 \u03bcL of lymphocytes were added. Similar procedure was performed for sheep erythrocytes coated with anti-CD4, anti-CD8, anti-CD22 monoclonal antibodies. The four mixtures were incubated for 40 min at 37 C. Then centrifuged at 1850\u00c2g for 5 min and incubated again for 1 h at \u00fe4 C to control for Fc\u03b3R -IgG interaction (Passwell et al., 1978) , i.e. it is blunted by incubation at 4 C. The supernatants were removed and 50 \u03bcL of a 0.12% solution of glutaraldehyde was added to the precipitate, which was carefully resuspended to avoid foaming. The four mixtures were incubated for another 5-7 min and carefully resuspended. Next, the same procedure was performed for four mixtures: a smear of 1 cm 2 was swabbed on a glass coverslip. The slide was then dried and fixed with alcohol, and Romanowsky staining was applied. Using a light microscope with an immersion objective, the number of rosettes (lymphocytes, which bind three or more erythrocytes with CD-antibodies), was calculated along with the total number of lymphocyte subsets. Calculations were performed for CD3 \u00fe T-cells, CD4 \u00fe T-cells, CD8 \u00fe T-cells and CD22 \u00fe B-cells.",

Adjustment of our data for age resulted in a loss of significance and a trend for 2-fold higher levels of TNF-a in children with CP (Fig. 1A, Table 1 ). Still, we found this way of interpretating our data to be more reasonable because it allowed us to compare groups of children with different age structures and to reproduce the results from a previous study (Wu and Li, 2015) . We also found 1.5-fold higher levels of IL-6 in children with CP after adjusting for age (Table 1) , which was similar to Pingel et al. (2019) , although the differences were not significant in either study. In addition, CRP, a clinical marker for inflammation, did not differ significantly between children with CP and healthy children ( Table 1) . Values of CRP above 1 mg/L, which indicate low-grade systemic inflammation (Kamath et al., 2015) , were registered in only 2 out of 23 patients with CP.

The total leukocyte count was 17% (P \u00bc .0179) lower in the healthy controls (Fig. 1B) , and to understand if such differences might be related to specific subpopulations of cells we analyzed the levels of dominating subpopulations of leukocytes, i.e. neutrophils and lymphocytes. The number of neutrophils was 8% higher in children with CP and did not differ significantly (P \u00bc .3938) (Table 1) . Thus, we proceeded by immunophenotyping the lymphocyte subpopulations. B-cells were identified by the B-cell-specific CD22 molecule (Erickson et al., 1996; MoyrOn-QuirOz et al., 2002) , which is expressed from early to late stages of maturation on all B-cell subsets in peripheral circulation but is gradually lost during the transformation from B-cells to memory B-cells and antibody-producing plasma cells (D\u20ac orner et al., 2015) , thus allowing us to explore B-cells with a shorter lifespan (Jones et al., 2015) . The total number of CD22 \u00fe B-cells (Fig. 1C, Table 1 ) was 28% higher (P \u00bc .0040) in children with CP compared to healthy controls. Moreover, levels of IgM were higher by 13% (P \u00bc .0378) in the CP group (Fig. 1D, Table 1 ).

First, we confirmed the efficacy of rehabilitation based on the principles of neuroplasticity, muscle strengthening, and stretching. The 30-day rehabilitation resulted in a gain in motor function for every child with CP with an average improvement of 6.73% when adjusted for age (a statistical process applied to rates of improvement that allowed us to compare children with CP of different ages). In addition, linear mixed effect regression analysis showed an effect of age on gain in motor function (P \u00bc .0414) ( Fig. 2A) , i.e. there was greater gain in motor function at earlier age. The complexity of the response to rehabilitation in this group of children was shown by the differences in vigor within the same age group, where motor improvement varied from one child to the next. These results are similar to the rehabilitation outcome after 30 days of intensive physical and occupational therapy for children with bilateral spastic CP seen in the study by Lee et al. (2015) . We next tested for pro-inflammatory TNF-a (Table 2) , which displayed no significant difference after rehabilitation. This was in line with the study by Libardi et al. (2012) showing stable levels of TNF-a after 1 and even 16 weeks of resistance, endurance, and concurrent training in sedentary adults. In children with CP, we proceeded by analyzing leukocytes, which showed no significant changes. We next analyzed lymphocyte populations and their related molecules, and after 30 days of rehabilitation we observed a 21% decrease in the number of B-cells (the reduction did not reach significance due to interindividual variance in dynamics) (Fig. 2B) . Notably, the levels of IgA decreased significantly by 10% (P \u00bc .0007) (Fig. 2D) with the same dynamics in almost all children. Complementary to this, the elevated IgM levels in children with CP showed a trend for a decrease of 6%, in contrast to stable IgG levels ( Table 2 ). The different isotypes have different half-lives in serum, with IgG being the most stable isotype. It is, therefore, possible that changes in levels are not detected for IgG after 30 days. To verify that the change in levels was linked to the turnover rate of immunoglobulins, we followed changes in IgA and IgM by evaluating their levels three times with intervals of 15 rehabilitation days ( Fig. 2D and C) . Levels of IgA dropped by an average of 9% after 15 days of rehabilitation, while IgM showed only a 2% decrease after 15 days of rehabilitation and a 6% decrease after 30 days of rehabilitation, i.e. we observed rather stable levels followed by a rapid drop. However, no correlations were found between B-cells or IgA and IgM levels and motor improvement. Fig. 2 .

            "text": "In this study we investigated innate and adaptive immune system components in children with spastic CP compared to healthy agematched children and the effect of rehabilitation on immune responses. Considering that muscle tissue composes up to 40% of the human body mass (Janssen et al., 2000) , Peterson et al. (2012) speculated that spasticity causes a variety of metabolic disturbances in children with CP, including persistent obesity and sedentary behavior-induced inflammation. This hypothesis is supported by the results on elevated TNF-a levels in our study (Table 1 ) and by Wu and Li (2015) . However, pro-inflammatory CRP levels were similar to those of the healthy controls. This might be partly explained by the average age of the participants, which was 5 years. Pingel et al. (2019) reported that children with CP (average age \u00bc 10 years) showed 7-fold higher CRP levels compared to adults with CP, although there was no significant difference between adults with CP and healthy adults. Thus, children might exhibit higher CRP levels that represent the beginning or the fading of subclinical infections that are more likely in younger age groups (Schlenz et al., 2014) . Complementary to this, the relevance of age is supported by the study of Bi et al. (2014) that showed significantly increased IL-6 levels in children with CP under 2 years of age, whereas there was no significant difference in IL-6 levels between healthy adults and adults with CP (Pingel et al., 2019) . In addition, Wu and Li (2015) reported 1.4-fold higher levels of TNF-a in children with CP under 4 years of age compared to older children with CP, which is in line with the negative slope when plotting TNF-a levels by age in our study (Fig. 1A) . Further investigation is needed to verify whether decreases in pro-inflammatory cytokines in patients with CP are associated with the natural maturation of the blood-brain barrier (Moretti et al., 2015) , as suggested by Wu and Li (2015) because both healthy adults and adults with CP exhibit similar levels of CRP and IL-6 (Pingel et al., 2019) , or if they are associated with levels of sympathetic nervous system activity due to brain damage, as described by Rogers et al. (1998) .",

(2015 Denham et al. ( , 2016 on epigenetic reprogramming of leukocytes by modified muscle activity, a molecular perspective might be of interest. Smith et al. (2009 Smith et al. ( , 2012 studied wrist and hamstring muscles and reported distinct transcriptional profiles in spastic skeletal muscles. Of particular relevance is the reported increased expression of growth factors such as insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) and platelet-derived growth factor C (PDGFC) in spastic muscles (Smith et al., 2012) . Serum IGF-1 has been reported to be associated with increased white blood cells, particular T-cells (CD4 \u00fe , CD8 \u00fe ) and B-cells (Devi et al., 2015; Hinton et al., 1998) , and PDGFC might mediate T-cell survival via PDGF regulation (Yang et al., 2010) . Thus, induced growth factor stimulation of lymphocyte survival is consistent with our findings of enhanced levels of CD3 \u00fe T-cells and both CD4 \u00fe and CD8 \u00fe T-cell subsets along with increased levels of CD22 \u00fe B-cells.",

In this study we found that 30-day rehabilitation resulted in immune responses (Table 2) such as a reduction in both B-cells and IgA and IgM levels, but no reduction in T-cells. Of particular interest is the reduction in IgA levels (Fig. 2D ) already after 15 days, whereas the reduction in IgM was slower but reached similar reduction after 30 days (Fig. 2C) . This difference is in line with the mean half-life of immunoglobulins in serum -2.6 days for IgA vs. 5 days for IgM and 13.8 days for IgG (Curtis and Bourne, 1973) . The difference in serum stability led us to hypothesize that the observed decline in IgA and IgM was caused by a reduction in immunoglobulin production. In comparison, measurements of total CD3 \u00fe T-cells along with CD4 \u00fe and CD8 \u00fe subsets showed steady levels of lymphocytes over the course of rehabilitation (Table 2 ). This is consistent with a 2-week-long investigation of peripheral blood T-cells in which the authors concluded that extended periods of physical activity, i.e. longer than 2 weeks, elicited significant changes in levels of T-cells (Brown et al., 2015) . In contrast to T-cell dynamics, we observed a trend for a decline in levels of B-cells in children with CP towards those of healthy children after 30 days of rehabilitation (Fig. 2B ). This is in line with the several-fold slower turnover ratesthe percentage of a cell population replaced by new cells per dayof T-cells compared to B-cells (Westera et al., 2015) where the median turnover rate in 42 days is 1.68% and 1.26% for na\u00efve CD4 \u00fe and CD8 \u00fe T-cells, respectively, in comparison to 9.66% for na\u00efve B-cellsthus allowing us to conclude that the faster turnover rate of the B-cells could have contributed to the trend for a decline. In addition, van Eyk et al. (2018) reported increased expression of CD24 and CD38 markers on B-cells in children with CP. These transitional markers are gradually lost during maturation and correspond to transitional B-cells (Bemark, 2015; Sanz et al., 2019) , i.e. B-cells undergoing sequential differentiation stages from newly formed immature bone marrow B-cells to functionally competent B-cells, the lifespan of which is shorter compared to memory B-cells and plasma cells. Overall, our results allow us to hypothesize that the effect of rehabilitation on the adaptive immune system is due to the effect of diminishing the factors that regulate lymphocyte turnover, i.e. a reduction in anti-apoptotic factors results in decreased survival and a consequent reduction in the number of lymphocytes.",

These results correspond to the age-related improvements reported by Lee et al. (2015) and support the general recommendations for early interventions (Hadders-Algra, 2014; Reid et al., 2015) . Additionally, interesting patterns have been observed by comparing data on immune alterations within different time frames after brain damage and in relation to age. Rogers et al. (1998) showed increased B-cell levels in adults within short time periods after brain damage, although adults who had suffered from perinatal brain damage did not show significant differences compared to healthy controls. Thus, considering that the observed B-cell and IgA and IgM dynamics are rather a consequence of diverse molecular interactions, we propose looking at growth factors and how they are correlated with age (Meybosch et al., 2019) and are associated with molecular alterations in spastic muscle (Smith et al., 2012) in order to follow movement improvement and thus establish biomarkers for rehabilitation efficacy. Our study provides a basis for future research into the development of personalized rehabilitation strategies and the development of immunomodulation therapy, which can improve the quality of life of patients with CP and better integrate them into society.",

Another limitation is that children with CP are rehabilitated according to the severity of motor disability, i.e. children do different exercises. In addition, the duration of each exercise is also based on the individual capability of the child. In conclusion, there is a need for large groups children with the same severity of motor disability (nationwide level) to investigate the effect of precisely calculated muscle activity on the immune system. Another limitation of the program is rather questionable because on the one hand rehabilitation is considerably expensive (involving a lot of highly qualified medical professionals), while on the other hand rehabilitation is required on a regular basis in order to improve quality of life. Thus, rehabilitation can serve both the primary goal of improving motor activity and the secondary goal of improving immune status in children with CP.",
