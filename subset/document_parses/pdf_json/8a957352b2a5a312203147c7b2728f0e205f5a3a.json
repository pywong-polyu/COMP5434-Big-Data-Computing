            "text": "The aim of this research is to investigate the impact of the COVID-19 closures from the perspective of students studying mathematics at university level in Ireland. A survey was designed and administered to students who were enrolled in at least one mathematics module in an Irish university at the time of the closures. The survey comprised three sections: teaching and learning, assessment and personal experience, with a focus on how the changes in teaching and assessment were viewed by students. A total of 263 students from six universities responded to the survey. The corresponding data are described, as are various trends that were identified through open-response questions. The data offer a window into the student experience during the tertiary level closures and show the effect that the sudden shifts (e.g., in delivery and support) had on learning, assessment and student well-being. The survey responses show that most students dealt with the rapid changes in a resilient and mature manner, particularly when confronted with adversity. Numerous insights can be gleaned from the students' perspectives that have the potential to improve the teaching and learning of mathematics at tertiary level in Ireland in the future. Many of the findings could also apply to teaching and learning in other subjects and internationally.",

In Ireland, the government announced the closure of schools, including universities and institutes of technology on 13 March 2020. Tertiary level institutions remained closed for the 2019-2020 academic year, with all teaching and assessment done remotely. The abrupt nature of the measures introduced by governments to combat the spread of the disease, combined with continued measures to minimize its spread, has placed significant logistical constraints on educators, support staff and students. Crawford et al. (2020) explored the first wave of responses of universities to the COVID-19 pandemic in perhaps the most wide-reaching study to date. They looked at 172 sources from 20 countries (including Ireland) to arrive at their findings. They found that most countries moved to fully online instruction during the spring semester in 2020 (March to May). Therefore, the situation in Irish universities has much in common with that of the rest of the world.",

            "text": "Prior to the pandemic, there had been an increase in the use of e-learning in universities, and over the past 10 years, many researchers have studied online instruction in undergraduate mathematics courses. Trenholm & Peschke (2020) outline six differences in execution between fully online and face-toface instruction in mathematics communities of practice at tertiary level. Among the differences they found is the notion that the content being learned is the same as before, but significant changes in communication, interaction and assessment must occur when transitioning from face-to-face to fully online learning (Trenholm & Peschke, 2020) . In particular, they note that fully online learning puts a greater responsibility on students to read or view resources themselves rather than be guided through material in a teacher-led setting. Trenholm & Peschke (2020) also note that mathematics notation is often a barrier to discussion since it is difficult for students to typeset symbols in emails or on forums. Trenholm & Peschke (2020) point out that the timing of interactions in fully online courses can be quite different to that in face-to-face modules as students may have to wait a considerable time to get a response to a question in an email; however, this also allows opportunities for students to reflect. A review of research on online learning in mathematics was carried out by Engelbrecht et al. (2020) . In this work, the authors investigate how the mathematics classroom has evolved with the growth of the internet and interactive devices. The authors outline how rapidly evolving technology has spawned micro-generations of students who have grown up in an increasingly technology-immersed world. Dineva et al. (2019) explain that despite differences between the micro-generations, they share strong core characteristics: students today have digital profiles on multiple social networks where they learn how to interact (Jukes et al., 2010) ; they are good multi-taskers who want information to be delivered in dynamic ways (Dineva et al., 2019) , often having procured it themselves as opposed to it being handed to them (Morin, 2016) ; and they collaborate well, often utilizing technology in the process (Engelbrecht et al., 2020) . Morin (2016) explains these learners have their own concerns, new motivations and new challenges with respect to education; the solutions to which Dineva et al. (2019) explain may lie in the increased capacity for interactivity and learning afforded by technology entering the classroom. We note, however, that research on massive open online courses, blended learning, flipped classrooms or other technologically progressive methods in use prior to COVID-19 might not be as applicable to current teaching as one might expect. Despite the fact that this work is undoubtedly instructive for practitioners who seek to move their teaching in this direction in the future, we consider it to be noticeably different to post-COVID-19 instruction. Engelbrecht et al. (2020) noted that many instructors were forced to move their teaching online very suddenly in Spring 2020 and this led the to a 'domestication of new media'-that is, the traditional versions of courses were used as models for the online versions without taking full advantage of the new opportunities afforded by the technology.",

            "text": "Perhaps a more accurate description of what unfolded in March 2020 is emergency remote teaching, which is described by Hodges et al. (2020) as follows: a temporary shift of instructional delivery to an alternate delivery mode due to crisis circumstances. It involves the use of fully remote teaching solutions for instruction or education that would otherwise be delivered face-to-face or as blended or hybrid courses and that will return to that format once the crisis or emergency has abated. (Hodges et al., 2020, p. 6) The student perspective of emergency remote teaching is arguably under reported internationally to date. Unger & Meiran (2020) investigated student perceptions and attitudes towards higher education distance learning during the pandemic in the USA 'at a small undergraduate university'. They found significant anxiety and reduced performance among their students brought about by the transition to online learning. Similarly, in an interview study of students in an Indian university, Chattaraj & Vijayaraghavan (2021, p. 9) reported student accounts of 'strangeness and lack of familiarity with the experiences of learning and learning space in Emergency Remote Learning'. Adnan & Anwar (2020) surveyed students concerning technology and infrastructure in Pakistan and reported similar dissatisfaction among students, with 78% of their respondents agreeing that face-to-face contact with the instructor is necessary for learning.",

            "text": "In this paper, we will describe the design and subsequent results of a survey (Appendix A) given to students who were enrolled in mathematics modules in Irish universities during Semester 2 (March to May) of the 2019-2020 academic year. The perspective of mathematics learners internationally to the COVID-19 closures is as yet under-reported, though a similar survey to ours was carried out by members of the School of Mathematics and Statistics at University College Dublin. Their results were published as an internal report (Meehan & Howard, 2020) and disseminated as a public lecture (10 May 2020). The study focused on students taking a mathematics module at University College Dublin at the time of the closures. The researchers reported on the positives (commuting, self-pacing) and negatives (internet connection, lack of peer interaction) that students associated with distance learning. They also reported that students perceived the quality of traditional lectures to remain relatively constant, whereas they perceived the quality of lectures that were more interactive prior to the closure to lessen following the move online. This is an issue with pedagogies for distance learning which was identified by the International Association of Universities Global Survey (Marinoni et al., 2020) which is not surprising given the difficulty of maintaining student interaction in the online setting. Apart from the University College Dublin study, research in this area in Ireland has focussed on the perspective of the lecturers (N\u00ed Fhloinn & Fitzmaurice, 2021) and support staff (Irish Mathematics Learning Support Network, 2021) in mathematics and on second-level science teachers (Chadwick et al., 2021) but has yet (insofar as we can ascertain) to investigate the student experience and their perceptions of higher education during the pandemic. The student perspective was captured in an article by two nursing students in Ireland, however, who report reduced motivation and a 'feeling of disconnectedness and isolation' brought about by a reduction in engagement between students and lecturers (Hill & Fitzgerald, 2020, p. 3) .",

The survey comprised 16 questions, divided into three sections: teaching and learning, assessment and personal experience. It consisted of a combination of closed questions (Likert scale items or 'tick box' responses) and some open response questions. The survey was advertised primarily through email. It was open from 9 July to 9 August 2020 and as such only pertained to the students' experience from 13 March until the end of semester at their institution. This included any learning and assessment during the second semester of the 2019-2020 academic year but does not cover subsequent learning and assessment associated with the 2020-2021 academic year, although this has also occurred under restrictions. The authors forwarded the survey to tertiary level mathematics lecturers in Ireland through various mailing lists and many of the lecturers forwarded the survey to their students.",

The quantitative data gathered in response to the closed response questions were tallied and are presented in tables in the Results section.

This approach allows 'research findings to emerge from the frequent, dominant or significant themes inherent in raw data, without the restraints imposed by structured methodologies ' (2006, p. 283) . The process, which uses coding to develop categories to condense the data, allows links between the research questions and the findings to be established (Thomas, 2006) . Procedures to assess the trustworthiness of the category system (independent coding, coding consistency check and stakeholder checks), which Thomas (2006) describes, were also practiced during our data analysis. Thomas' (2006) general inductive approach was used in the analysis of the responses to 11 open questions on the survey. The analysis began with the preparation of the raw data files which were read and interpreted multiple times by the authors independently. Once this was done, each author identified the themes in the data and defined categories on a question-by-question basis. The authors' categories were combined to form an exhaustive list. We refined this list by removing duplicates and grouping very similar categories together. Each of the categories were reduced to a word or short phrase (label of category) encapsulating their meaning. The student responses were then categorized by each researcher independently before a meeting took place to discuss outliers and other discrepancies.",

Nine options (those in Table 2 ) were given to students as a list where they were asked to select every method utilized by their lecturers. The results show the wide range of approaches adopted by lecturers. The use of online shared spaces or virtual learning environments (VLEs) (e.g., Moodle, Blackboard) to upload a variety of resources was the most popular method of delivery. Live or recorded presentations and screencasts were commonly used, and some students mentioned that they were directed to external resources (e.g., YouTube, Khan Academy).

Another striking feature of the responses to this question is the small number of students (18.6%) who said that they were directed to existing online material. This means that lecturers created a huge amount of online content in a very short time period. Many of the students reported that their lecturers (in addition to providing content through lectures or notes) also created practice quizzes and worked examples and made solutions to assignments and past examination questions available. However, even though these resources were made available to students, the responses to Q3 of our survey (Table 3) show that students struggled with the move from face-to-face to remote learning. About 59% of them said that the closures had a negative impact on their capacity to learn mathematics, with only 21.3% saying that the impact was positive. Students reported negative effects on their ability to learn through lectures (59.4%), tutorials (65.8%) and mathematics support services (54.7%).

The majority of learners (90%) were assessed using terminal online exams, either with multiple choice questions (including open response questions) or with upload of solutions. This number includes modules where terminal exams were used in conjunction with continuous assessment. The use of continuous assessment only was far less frequent, with only 28 students (10%) reporting being assessed in this manner. Two students reported no terminal assessment and a further two were not sufficiently clear for their responses to be labelled appropriately. A significant majority of the students (80%) considered the assessment to be fair (albeit unconventional), given the circumstances (Q7). However, areas for improvement with respect to assessment were also identified: only 43% of students said that they received feedback on any submitted work, and almost a quarter of students (24%) had technical difficulties during their final assessment.",

There were 11 parts to this question included in the analysis; we have already seen the data from the five parts in Table 1 . We discuss the responses to three of the sub-questions here (and another three in Table 9 ), beginning with expressions of motivation, anxiety and isolation. Students reported feeling increased anxiety and isolation during the Covid-19 closures. This is to be expected with such a sudden switch from in person to distance learning but is none the less worrying. Of the 263 students who responded to the survey, 164 (62%) reported increased anxiety, 148 (56%) felt isolated from their lecturers and peers and 169 (64%) students believed it was more difficult to motivate themselves during lockdown. Strategies for addressing isolation were sought; many responses suggested ways of increasing contact among students while acknowledging the difficulty of resolving such an issue in the current environment. The increased isolation is also seen in responses to parts of Q3 (Table 3) , where students reported negative effects on communication with lecturers, peers and support services and a very negative impact on their capacity to peer study which recurs throughout the data. We did not see statistically significant relationships between the teaching methods experienced by students and their levels of anxiety. However, we did see that students who had access to solutions to worked examples (chi-square test, p = 0.048) and practice quizzes (p = 0.003) were more likely to agree that it was easier to motivate themselves than students who did not have access to these resources. We also saw that students who reported having solutions to worked examples were less likely to feel isolated (p = 0.024). Surprisingly, we did not see relationships between whether students had live lectures or not and the motivation, anxiety and isolation variables.",

Though fully online learning continued, the approaches to teaching and assessment of instructors may have subsequently evolved to incorporate much of what is discussed in this research. As mentioned previously, advertising a survey during summer was not an appropriate way to recruit students studying at Institutes of Technology. Similarly, the timing may have elicited a greater proportion of responses from university students who are preparing for repeat examinations or students who may check their emails more regularly than others. This may impact how representative our results are. We acknowledge the shortcomings in the timing of the survey, offering only the time sensitive nature of the research as a mitigating circumstance. We acknowledge that we do not have information about how often the teaching methods in Table 2 were used in individual modules and therefore it is difficult to make inferences based on this data. Another aspect to be discussed is the wording of questions: we decided to omit the results relating to Q13, for example, due to possible ambiguities in the wording of the question.",

The asynchronous nature of recorded lectures and lecture notes uploaded to VLEs is also indicative of 'domestication of new media' (Engelbrecht et al., 2020) .",

One of the reasons for this was the immediacy of response, though the transient nature of live sessions may also be a factor: posting questions to an online forum attaches the student's name to the query and oftentimes the question itself remains visible on the forum indefinitely. Furthermore, mathematics notation can often act as a barrier to communication in online settings (Trenholm & Peschke, 2020) . We see evidence of this in student responses to the challenges they faced in Spring 2020 (Table 6 ) and in their reluctance to ask questions in discussion forums.",

The problems involving poor connectivity and/or hardware (laptop/scanner) faults may be evidence of inequality affecting outcomes for students in a manner that is unique to the online setting. Responses to parts of Q12 (Table 1) showed a majority of students had access to the requisite hardware and internet connectivity to engage with lectures remotely, although many students were relying on their smartphones or tablets in order to access resources and to act as scanners. We note, however, that students without access to laptops and broadband are less likely to have responded to our survey, making our reported figures something of a 'best case scenario'. It is concerning that nearly a quarter of the respondents did not have a quiet place to study or indeed to take their final examinations. Some improvements have been made recently in this area, with universities making quiet rooms available on campus so that certain students have a suitable location to take their examinations (even during subsequent university closures).",

Finally, two particularly interesting comments that concern delivery of teaching upon partial return to campus are More/All resources should be uploaded even when in-person delivery returns and Tutorials and support services should return to in person before lectures. One approach to blended learning could be to facilitate some teaching in person while continuing to offer the same product online. This approach has been used by some American universities for 10 years (Bell & Federman, 2013) and would be an improvement on the quality of blended learning reported in this study. Prioritizing support services above lectures is supported by much of the data previously reported. With respect to future assessment, the majority of students still expressed a preference for final examinations, but some saw the value of increased continuous assessment in the future.",

The comments refer to different experiences from module to module within and across departments. It is unrealistic to expect delivery and assessment to have been completely standardized for Semester 2 2019-2020, but perhaps conversations that clarify what is expected of lecturers, tutors and students should be facilitated where possible to ensure the highest quality of teaching and learning occurs moving forward.

However, the challenges for students with caring responsibilities and/or frontline jobs, students without access to the appropriate technology or infrastructures and students without access to an appropriate study space were difficult to surmount. Each of these circumstances present unique difficulties, and the issue of equal access in distance learning must be addressed. It is crucial that insights from students are heard and incorporated into the delivery and assessment of mathematics moving forward. Distance learning offers obvious cost-saving measures for institutions (building costs, scope to increase enrolment) and students (rent/commute), although there are also additional costs incurred by both groups. For example, implicit in online learning is access to the necessary equipment in an appropriate environment (discussed previously). Hodges et al.'s (2020) description of emergency remote teaching encapsulates the initial COVID-19-related closures well, but we wish to highlight their inference that such an approach is only intended to be short term. At the time of writing, Irish universities are beginning their third semester of teaching in this manner and there is no doubt that the community has become more accustomed to the changes. With the rollout of vaccines ongoing, an end to COVID-19 related closures is in sight but the lessons we have learned as a community should not be discarded (Hodges et al., 2020) .
