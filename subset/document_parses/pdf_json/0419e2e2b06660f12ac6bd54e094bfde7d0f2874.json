In week 1, the content focused on how today's society engages with death through the language we use, humour, public mourning and funerals. This study investigated 2020 MOOC participants' responses to an online activity reflecting on funerals and memorials during the time of COVID-19. From this activity, n = 204 responses were analysed qualitatively. Themes included the positives and negatives of virtual funeral attendance (e.g. opportunity to have a way to participate when travel barriers existed, versus a sense of impersonal voyeurism); and the challenges related to the inability to physically comfort the bereaved due to physical distancing requirements. Comments made as part of this MOOC activity provide a unique insight into the community's experience of funeral changes necessitated by COVID-19, with important implications for the grieving process.",

            "text": "The funeral ritual has been present for millennia across countries, cultures and religions, most often preceded by family presence during the dying period, followed by gathering together to say goodbye (Jordan et al., 2021) . Evidence suggests that mourning rituals play an important role in the grieving process. These rituals can assist in mitigating grief responses in part through the underlying mechanism of restoring feelings of control (Norton & Gino, 2014) . However, in late 2019 and in the 2 years since, the Coronavirus COVID-19 pandemic (referred to here as COVID-19) has seen millions of deaths globally, and with it many restrictions on visitors to those who are very ill in both hospitals and in aged care facilities (Burrell & Selman, 2020; Parks & Howard, 2021) . This has seen, in the first instance, isolation during dying, with families and friends not allowed to be present, and with some people dying alone (Bauld et al., 2021) or only in the presence of health professionals, and families not necessarily asked to identify the body (Imber-Black, 2020; Katz et al., 2021; Sudai, 2021 , The management of those who have died has also seen the disruption of rituals in some cultures that usually see families helping to prepare the body for burial (Hamid & Jahangir, 2020) , or hold a public viewing (Lowe et al., 2020) . In some instances, death may have been unexpected, and/or family and friends were unable to travel to see the dying person even if allowed a personal visit (Carr et al., 2020; Oliveira Cardoso et al., 2020) . This has potentially left a permanent legacy for many of those left behind who have been unable to say goodbye to their loved ones (Wakam et al., 2020) .",

This lack of social support, and of comfort given and received, has seen a changed landscape of dying and of grief (Jordan et al., 2021) . It has also seen a marked change in mortuary practices and the responsibility of funeral directors (Dijkhuizen et al., 2020) .

The activity posed the following to participants: 'Most (if not all) of you will have attended a funeral in your lifetime, and now we'd like you to reflect on what that experience has been like. We are also interested in how people have had to come up with imaginative and innovative ideas to remember someone who has died given the COVID-19 pandemic. How have you seen funerals or memorials change in the time of COVID-19? For example, have you attended a funeral or memorial virtually? What was good about this and what was hard?' The latter aspect of funeral experiences in the time of COVID-19 is the focus of this paper.",

Almost all activity-respondents were residing in Australia (n = 562, 94.8%), with those residing outside of Australia predominantly being based in New Zealand (3.9%).

All comments in the discrete dataset related to COVID-19 funeral experiences made by participants were included for analysis, and data was fully de-identified prior to analysis. The content of the open-ended textual responses was analysed qualitatively using content analysis (Blair, 2015; Coolican, 2019; Elo & Kyngas, 2008; Thomas, 2006) . This approach was considered suitable because the relatively short nature of the written statements provided by participants precluded the use of deeper interpretive analysis, and because content analysis can be used for providing a descriptive understanding of thematic categories as well as quantitative counts of code frequency (Elo & Kyngas, 2008; Vaismoradi et al., 2013) . Participant responses were scanned and read through multiple times to inductively search for common meaningful coding units to represent the reflections provided by participants, and thematic categories were generated for those that were recurringly mentioned. The first phase involved two raters independently generating codes through open coding a random subset of 15% (n = 85) of the activity responses. Open coding was used as an inductive emergent coding technique where codes were drawn directly from the text (Blair, 2015) . Each participant's statement could be assigned multiple coding labels, given that sentences provided held various levels of detail on their experiences. The two raters then came together to discuss their open-codes created from this development cohort, with the codes refined and merged together to (a) create a clear set of inclusion and exclusion criteria regarding which responses were relevant to the COVID-19 pandemic (see Table 1 ) and (b) to generate a coding schema guide for grouping the COVID-related responses and their codes into higher-order thematic categories. Codes describing similar events and experiences were grouped together into thematic categories and then if relevant those categories were grouped into broader higher-order thematic categories (Elo & Kyngas, 2008; Thomas, 2006) .",

Table 2 shows demographic information pertaining to the n = 204 who, as part of this broader activity, reported having a funeral experience during COVID-19 times and the key focus of the subsequent analyses. Most of the n = 204 MOOC participants reporting funeral experiences during COVID-19 were female (91.5%), with a mean age of 52.1 years (SD = 11.9). Of the n = 204 participants who had a COVID-era funeral experience, almost all resided in Australia (95.6%), a small proportion resided in New Zealand (2.9%), with only n = 3 participants not located in these two Oceanic Countries. During 2020, both Australia and New Zealand had international travel restrictions in place, along with border closures between states/regions. Of the subsample living in Australia, most were located in the eastern Australian states of Victoria (30.8%), New South Wales (29.7%), or Queensland (22.1%). At the time of responding to the funerals' activity, Victoria was under strict COVID-19 lockdown restrictions (Faasse & Newby, 2020) . Regarding education, most participants reported previously completing some form of university study (68.1%). Health professionals were prolific in the respondent sample, with 75% reporting that they self-identify as being a health professional (either currently or in the past), plus 51.5% of the respondent sample stating that they were currently working clinically as a health professional. Within the subsample of participants who identified as a health professional, the largest proportion of these were nurses (38.6%), followed by allied health professionals (23.5%). Demographic characteristics of participants who had experienced a COVID-era funeral (n = 204) were compared to participants who did not report this experience as part of the funerals activity (n = 389). There were no statistically significant differences between groups on gender, age-group, country, Australian State, educational level, occupation, or whether they currently worked as a health professional (chi-square tests of independence X 2 all p >.05).",

The way in which funerals have been conducted to date though is through choiceof venue, who is notified/invited and proceedings, and choice or feelings of control in this ritualised process tends to mitigate grief responses (Norton & Gino, 2014) .

For many the fact that close family (even spouses) may not be able to attend due to restricted numbers, quarantine or inability to travel (such as border closures) was hard to consider. The restrictions on numbers allowed to attend changed in response to government guidelines and so many of the bereaved were faced with choosing who could attend and who could not (Walter & Bailey, 2020) . The fact that physical distancing prevented close contact was also described negatively, with an inability to sit close to someone, hug and comfort them or more intimately share their grief, with social contact and connectedness fundamental to well-being (Abel & Taubert, 2020) . Also noteworthy were the unfortunate technical glitches which included lack of sound, badly placed cameras and recollections of some people being provided with a live streaming link or even a service recorded on a USB and left to watch it alone. For some, this virtual attendance was likened to an impersonal voyeurism that meant they were not engaged or connected to what was happening, or to the death. The inability to say goodbye in a traditional or ritualised way was felt to impact on grief, mourning and potentially bereavement (Burrell & Selman, 2020) .",

Somewhat surprisingly, a third of our participants were able to articulate positive impacts related to the COVID-era funeral changes. The main positive mentioned was that people felt appreciative and grateful about being able to attend a funeral virtually when they would otherwise have missed out because of number restrictions or travel barriers. This response is reminiscent of the concept of benefit-finding. Benefit-finding is an adaptive coping response where we look for positive aspects of challenging crisis situations, and it has been seen in other studies related to COVID-19 (August & Dapkewicz, 2021; Cox et al., 2021; Evans et al., 2020) . Another positive reaction to funeral changes mentioned by some was the increased intimacy of a small funeral meaning that they felt more able to absorb what was happening, and that those attending were really present in the moment and not trying to meet and greet or worry about others. This felt much more personal for some, as was the ability to replay the funeral later if recorded. Burrell and Selman (2020) highlight that the numbers of those attending may not be important, nor the type of funeral that is held, but what is important is how meaningful it is and how connected people feel.",

The views expressed by our participants are likely to be quite different to those from less privileged countries where death tolls were high (Entress et al.,2020) and people struggled to find enough wood to cremate their loved ones, or where people were buried in mass graves. The loss of choice and control in respect to funerals in Australia seems insignificant to what some other countries have experienced.",

These COVID-19-related changes that have been needed to funerals (and the experience of dying that preceded it) are likely to have important implications for the grieving process and this may in turn be seen in bereavement outcomes, but this is yet to be fully realised. Future research is required into the longer-term effects of changes to funeral rituals during the COVID-19 pandemic on grief and bereavement outcomes, in that while COVID-19 has been disruptive, will it also reconceptualise how we see funerals and mourning moving forward? Such longitudinal research may assist clinicians and funeral directors with supporting those experiencing bereavement during and beyond the era of COVID-19.",
