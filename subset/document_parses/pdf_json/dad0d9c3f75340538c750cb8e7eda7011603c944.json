            "text": "Purpose: Accurate segmentation of lung and infection in COVID-19 CT scans plays an important role in the quantitative management of patients. Most of the existing studies are based on large and private annotated datasets that are impractical to obtain from a single institution, especially when radiologists are busy fighting the coronavirus disease. Furthermore, it is hard to compare current COVID-19 CT segmentation methods as they are developed on different datasets, trained in different settings, and evaluated with different metrics. Methods: To promote the development of data-efficient deep learning methods, in this paper, we built three benchmarks for lung and infection segmentation based on 70 annotated COVID-19 cases, which contain current active research areas, e.g., few-shot learning, domain generalization, and knowledge transfer. For a fair comparison among different segmentation methods, we also provide standard training, validation and testing splits, evaluation metrics and, the corresponding code. Results: Based on the state-of-the-art network, we provide more than 40 pre-trained baseline models, which not only serve as out-of-the-box segmentation tools but also save computational time for researchers who are interested in COVID-19 lung and infection segmentation. We achieve average Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) scores of 97.3%, 97.7%, and 67.3% and average Normalized Surface Dice (NSD) scores of 90.6%, 91.4%, and 70.0% for left lung, right lung, and infection, respectively. Conclusions: To the best of our knowledge, this work presents the first data-efficient learning benchmark for medical image segmentation, and the largest number of pre-trained models up to now. All these resources are publicly available, and our work lays the foundation for promoting the development of deep learning methods for efficient COVID-19 CT segmentation with limited data.",

Shan et al. developed a neural network based on V-Net and the bottle-neck structure to segment and quantify infection regions [15] , [16] . In their human-in-the-loop strategy, they achieved 85.1%, 91.0% and 91.6% dice with 36, 114, and 249 labelled CT scans, respectively. Huang et al. [12] employed U-Net [17] for lung and infection using an annotated dataset of 774 cases, and demonstrated that the trained model could be used for quantifying the disease burden and monitoring disease progressions or treatment responses. In general, we have observed a trend that training deep learning models with more annotations will decrease the time needed for contouring the infection, and increase segmentation accuracy, which is consistent with the Shan et al.'s findings [15] . However, annotations for 3D CT volume data are expensive to acquire because it not only relies on professional diagnosis knowledge of radiologists, but also takes much time and labor, especially in current situation.

Most of the existing studies rely on large private dataset with hundreds of annotated CT scans. \u2022 There are no public benchmarks to evaluate different deep learning-based solutions, and different studies often use various evaluation metrics. Similarly, datasets for training, validating and testing are split diversely, which also makes it hard for readers to compare those methods. For example, although MedSeg (http://medicalsegmentation.com/covid19/) dataset with 100 annotated slices were used in [18] , [19] , [20] , [21] , and [22] to develop COVID-19 segmentation methods, it was split in different ways and the developed methods were evaluated by different metrics. \u2022 There are no publicly available trained baseline models for COVID-19. U-Net, a well-known segmentation architecture, is commonly used as a baseline network in many studies. However, due to different implementations, the reported performance varies in different studies [19] , [22] , even though the experiments are conducted on the same dataset. In this paper, we focus on annotation-efficient deep learning solutions and aim to alleviate the above problems by providing a well-labelled COVID-19 CT dataset and a benchmark. In particular, we first provide a COVID-19 3D CT dataset with left lung, right lung, and infection annotations, and then establish three benchmark tasks to explore different deep learning strategies with limited training cases. Finally, we build comprehensive baselines for each task based on U-Net.",

However, recent study [36] demonstrates that it is still hard to surpass a basic U-Net if the corresponding pipeline is designed adequately. In particular, nnU-Net (no-new-U-Net) [36] was proposed to automatically adapt preprocessing strategies and network architectures (i.e., the number of pooling, convolutional kernel size, and stride size) to a given 3D medical dataset. Without manual tuning, nnU-Net can achieve better performance than most specialised deep learning pipelines in 19 public international segmentation competitions and set a new state-of-the-art in the majority of 49 tasks. The source code is publicly available at https://github. com/MIC-DKFZ/nnUNet. U-Net is often used as a baseline model in existing COVID-19 CT segmentation studies. However, reported results vary a lot even in the same dataset, which make it hard to compare different studies. To standardize the U-Net performance, we build our baselines on nnU-Net that is the most powerful U-Net implementation to the best of our knowledge. To make it comparable between different tasks, we manually adjust the patch sizes and network architectures in Task 2 and Task 3 to be the same as Task 1. Figure 2 shows details of the U-Net architecture. During pre-processing, we apply Z-score (mean subtraction and division by standard deviation) to normalize the image intensities. During training, we use the standard training scheme of nnU-Net. For example, The sum between cross entropy and Dice loss is used as the loss function. The optimizer is stochastic gradient descent with initial learning rate (0.01) and a large nesterov momentum (0.99) and, 'PolyLR' schedule [37] is used to reduce the learning rate. We randomly sample image patches with size 192 \u00d7 192 \u00d7 64. All training procedures run for a fixed length of 1000 epochs, where each epoch is defined as 250 training iterations (batch size 2). During testing, we use the same patch size with sliding window to infer testing cases and the sliding stride is half the patch size 8 .",

It can be found that \u2022 on the in-domain testing set, the performance of lesion segmentation is not as good as the performance of lung segmentation (Table V) , which means that tumor segmentation remains a challenging problem. This observation is in line with recent results in MICCAI tumor segmentation challenge, i.e. liver tumor segmentation [38] and kidney tumor segmentation [39] . \u2022 the models almost fail to predict COVID-19 infections on testing set, which highlights that the lesion appearances differ significantly among lung cancer, pleural effusion, and COVID-19 infections in CT scans.",

            "text": "Tasks 1-3 correspond to different strategies for lung and infection segmentation in COVID-19 CT scans with limited indomain training cases and out-of-domain datasets. The testing cases are the same in Tasks 1-3, so it is feasible and reasonable to conduct comparison among different tasks. Table IX presents quantitative results on all testing sets of the three tasks in terms of average DSC and NSD. Task 1-Separate and -Union denote training the network to segment lung and infection separately and simultaneously, respectively. Figure 4 shows the violin plots of left lung, right lung, and infection segmentation results on COVID-19-CT-Seg dataset in terms of DSC and NSD for all tasks. The violin plot shows not only the summary statistics such as median and interquartile ranges, but also the entire distribution of the quantitative results. while adding a few COVID-19 cases can significantly boost the performance, which highlights that including a few indomain cases during training is very critical for developing infection segmentation models. In addition, it can be found that the infection segmentation performance is lower than lung segmentation in all the experiments. There are two main reasons. First, the task setting is few-shot learning, where only limited labelled cases are allowed to train networks. Second, compared with the lung, the infection areas are relatively small and most of the infections have weak boundaries. Thus, infection segmentation is much more challenging than lung segmentation. Table X shows the recall and precision of the segmentation results in different tasks. It can be found that the infection segmentation results have relatively high precision scores and low recall scores, indicating that the model fails more in detecting all infections. Lung segmentation results achieve better recall and precision scores because the lung tissues have more clear boundaries and larger sizes. Figure 5 presents some visualized segmentation results in different tasks. We can find that the lung segmentation mostly failed due to the confusion between the left lung and the right lung because they share very similar appearances. The large and obvious infections have better segmentation results. However, the infections in small sizes or with weak boundaries are the most often failed cases.",

We found that the infections with good contrast and clear boundaries can be well segmented even with only four training cases. However, the trained models often miss the small infections and weak-boundary infections, indicating that it is hard for the models to capture these features during learning process. Our results also highlight the need of efficient learning methods with limited annotated data. Although including more training cases could be a simple and direct way to boost the infection segmentation performance, one should keep in mind that, in clinical practice, it is impractical to manually annotate many 3D COVID-19 CT scans for each medical center especially when the radiologists are busy with fighting the pandemic. This is our main motivation to set up the data-efficient learning benchmark.",

In addition, designing task-specific data augmentation methods is also a promising solution, such as augment more cases with small and weak boundary infections. In domain generalization task (Task 2), the models trained with only non-COVID-19 dataset fail to segment infections. One can introduce more advanced model-agnostic learning methods to handle the domain gap, such as meta-learning [41] , [42] . In knowledge transfer task (Task 3), simply fusing non-COVID-19 and COVID-19 dataset with the SOTA network could bias the model to learn more non-COVID-19 features.

In addition, the number of cases (16 or 20 cases) for the first testing set (COVID-19-CT-Seg) and 50 cases for the second testing set (MosMed) is comparable with recent MICCAI 2020 segmentation challenges. For example, StructSeg (Automatic Structure Segmentation for Radiotherapy Planning Challenge 2020) has 10 testing cases [46] and ASOCA (Automated Segmentation Of Coronary Arteries) has 20 testing cases [47] . Another limitation is that the innovative methodology contribution is limited. However, this is not the primary goal in this paper. Rather, our main goal is to lay the foundation for future work in learning with limited annotated data, and we believe the dataset and the tasks mentioned in the benchmark could attract attentions in the field.",

To promote the research towards this goal, in this paper, we created a COVID-19 CT dataset, established three segmentation benchmark tasks, and provided 40+ baselines models based on state-of-the-art segmentation architectures. All the related results are publicly available at https://github.com/JunMa11/COVID-19-CT-Seg-Benchmark. The unified task settings can make the comparison between studies more feasible. The public baselines can save model training time for researchers so that they can focus on developing their own methods. We hope this work could accelerate the COVID-19 studies on learning with limited data for years to come.
