We hypothesize that reading comprehension, as measured by performance in a non-math software tutorial, will be correlated with performance in the math modules of the same software.

To determine whether the reading performance measure is simply capturing other student behaviors, we will assess the relation between our measure of reading comprehension and wheel spinning and gaming. Wheel spinning occurs when a student fails to demonstrate mastery of a skill after a long time, typically indicating that they do not have the skills or support to advance [22] . Gaming occurs when students attempt to take advantage of the design of the software to get the correct answer without thinking carefully or learning, such as exploiting hints or clicking through multiplechoice answers until they find the correct response, and it typically involves making a large number of mistakes in a short amount of time [23] . If reading comprehension is highly correlated with these other measures, it may suggest that our measure of reading comprehension is simply detecting wheel spinning or gaming behaviors, since both can be associated with poor performance and learning. We hypothesize that our measure may be moderately correlated with gaming, as poor reading comprehension could lead to attempts to solve the problems without carefully reading them, but that it will not be strongly correlated with either, suggesting it is also detecting something unique.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 770, "end": 774, "text": "[22]", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 1119, "end": 1123, "text": "[23]", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "RQ2:"}, {"text": "We analyzed two datasets: a smaller dataset with more detailed step-level data from the math software (Dataset 1) and a larger dataset with less detailed, problem-level data from the same software (Dataset 2).
