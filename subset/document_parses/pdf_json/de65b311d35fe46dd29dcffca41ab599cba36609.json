The author recognises that the welfare of free-living wild animals is also important in promoting animal health and minimizing the risks of zoonosis, but space requirements do not permit discussion of these issues. However, the goal of achieving indirect protection of the welfare of free-living wild animals through the protection of species and ecosystems must also be properly addressed 12 through the kinds of conservation law reforms suggested by other scholars (as referred to above).",

Section 1 of the article considers the gaps in international law for the protection of wild animals and the links between animal welfare, conservation and health which have been largely overlooked. Section 2 examines wildlife breeding practices in China, including what is being bred, and why, and describes the legislation currently in place to protect the health of wild animals in trade. Section 3 focuses on the need for welfare standards to effectively protect the health of wild animals in China. Section 4 identifies opportunities to secure more effective wild animal protection at the international level through the increased adoption of the 'One Health' 13 concept, the introduction of a new convention to protect wild animal welfare, and the inclusion of wildlife crime as a protocol under the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organised Crime. 14 Section 5 argues that the recently introduced national prohibition on the consumption of certain terrestrial species in China does not go far enough and should include all high-risk species including those farmed for traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). Section 6 (the concluding part) provides recommendations for the increased welfare protection of wild species in China for the benefit of both animal and human health. ",

CITES seeks to achieve this by ensuring that international trade in endangered species is sustainable. The CBD seeks to conserve biodiversity and to ensure the sustainable use of its components. Very little recognition is given in either treaty to the need to protect wild animal welfare. 15 Contrarily, animal welfare laws focus on protecting the health and well-being of animals regardless of their conservation status or value. In failing to differentiate between endangered and flourishing species, animal welfare protections have historically had limited relevance to conservationists. 16 This has resulted in conservation treaties 17 having very little to say about animal welfare. 18 With their strict conservation focus, CITES and the CBD have even gone so far as to ignore the need to provide the same welfare protections to the populations of animals they seek to conserve as are routinely afforded to domestic animals in many countries. 19 This limited focus on conservation has resulted in a significant welfare problem for captive wild animals in trade. 20 Grave welfare as well as conservation harms are routinely caused to wild animals as a result of poaching, hunting and even legal trade. While CITES includes some articles requiring parties to minimise the risk of injury, damage to health and cruel treatment of animals in preparation and preservation for live transport, 21 the Convention offers no detailed provisions mandating animal welfare standards. This is a significant omission, from both a conservation and welfare perspective.",

            "text": "Concerns about the jurisdictional limits of CITES have resulted in the absence of controls on capture methods that could help to minimise the likelihood of animals suffering cruel treatment in capture which may impact their survival rate in transit. Article VIII (3) of CITES obliges parties to ensure that animals 'during any period of transit, holding or shipment, are properly cared for, so as to minimise the risk of injury, damage to health or cruel treatment'. At the CITES meeting in Botswana in 1983, Gambia proposed that authorities should be required to go further and ensure the humane treatment of animals in capture. The proposal was voted down on the basis that the Convention text did not include the power to require a management authority to ensure humane treatment had occurred between the capture and preparation for export of an animal. 22 Even in transport, where CITES clearly has the jurisdiction to require member states to enforce transport standards that adequately protect the health and well-being of animals, the standards applied vary. While the Secretariat of the Convention has urged member states to adopt the International Air Transport Association (IATA) Live Animals Regulations 23 and the CITES Guidelines for the Non-Air Transport of Live Wild Animals and Plants, 24 few countries outside of the European Union (EU) have legislated to make compliance with these welfare standards mandatory because the Convention text does not require it.",

            "text": "The first internationally recognised animal welfare issue was, ironically, the need to protect animal health to prevent the spread of contagious diseases and the risk of zoonotic diseases. Recognition of the increased threat of disease amongst animals with poor welfare led to the establishment of the OIE in the 1920s. 27 The role of this organisation remains significant today. Of the new and emerging human infectious diseases discovered in the past 50 years, 75% involve zoonosis. 28 Most described zoonosis is transmitted via the food system. 29 Today, the OIE has 182 member states/countries and sets standards for the improvement of animal health and welfare through its collaborations with the veterinary authorities in each of its member states. The OIE publishes both Terrestrial and Aquatic Animal Health Codes, the standards for which are regularly updated by its scientific committees and which must be adopted by the World Assembly of Delegates, the organisation's The OIE has, for many years, recognised that animal health and animal welfare are linked 32 and the guidance it provides is extremely important for the global protection of animals. However, the OIE's standards for animal health and welfare have been deficient in addressing the farming of wild species. The OIE's focus, perhaps understandably, has primarily been on the links between the health and welfare of domestic animals commonly used in agriculture. Prescriptive standards set by the OIE are necessarily based on robust science. International studies on health and welfare in animal husbandry have tended to focus on domestic species as these make up the majority of animals farmed. With the exception of deer, 33 wild boar 34 and mink, 35 there have been few scientific studies done to determine best practices in farming wild animals. 36 Wildlife farming includes the commercial breeding of wild species for human consumption. In the EU, scientific studies of farmed animal health and welfare have largely been led by the European Food and Safety Authority's Scientific Panel on Animal Health and Welfare. The Authority provides advice to the EU on existing and emerging risks related to food safety and animal health and welfare for the purposes of supporting law and policy. However, these studies have been limited to animals bred in the EU. This has meant that what is being farmed outside of the EU has not been sufficiently studied and monitored for health risks.",

They are also farmed to meet demand levels that cannot be sustained from the wild. In the absence of any international agreement as to how they should be treated, few standards have been developed by governments for farming wild animals. 37 Those countries which have developed prescriptive standards for animal husbandry, and ensured their enforcement through legislation, have tended to focus on domestic animals. 38 There is limited peer-reviewed research on the welfare, husbandry and nutritional needs of rarer wild species. 39 A good example is provided by the Chinese pangolin, which is legally farmed in China for its scales, which are used in TCM. Pangolins do poorly in captivity and many animals rescued from illegal trade and placed in captivity on Chinese breeding farms die due to improper husbandry practices. 40 Lack of scientific data presents a significant obstacle to the development of appropriate husbandry standards to safeguard pangolins and consequently public health.",

            "text": "2.1 What is Being Farmed (Currently and Historically) and Why? Wildlife farming is actively encouraged under China's current Wildlife Protection Law (as amended in 2016), but China has viewed wildlife breeding as a form of conservation for decades. In 1954, the Chinese Communist Party began to issue a series of directions intended to secure the breeding of endangered and rare animals to ensure the steady supply of traditional Chinese medicines. 41 From its earliest inception in 1989, the Wildlife Protection Law promoted the utilisation of wild animals as resources to meet market demand. However, it was not until September 2004 that the State Forestry Bureau, the national bureau with charge of wildlife protection and management in China issued its 'Guiding Opinion on Promoting the Sustainable Development of Wild Animals and Plants', which expressly endorsed the captive breeding of 54 wild animals to meet market demand for consumption. 42 The Guiding Opinion required Forestry officials to actively promote the breeding and market supply of terrestrial wild animals for which mature breeding technology had been developed. A list of 54 species was selected for active breeding by the Ministry for Forestry in August 2003, 43 despite all having been classified under the Wildlife Protection Law as of important ecological, scientific or social value to China. The Opinion made clear that captive breeding of wild animals was to be encouraged on the principle that growing market demand for wild animal products could be met through government-supported wildlife farming, reducing the likelihood of poaching and illegal smuggling. 44 farming operation, the bear bile industry, has touted itself as a national success in producing over 10 tonnes of bear bile powder annually for medicinal use. 45 In reality, wild populations of Asiatic black bears, the main species used by the industry, continue to face hunting pressure in China, 46 as well as in neighbouring Lao People's Democratic Republic, Myanmar and Viet Nam, where they are poached to supply Chinese bear farms. 47 The wildlife breeding industry has grown to provide significant economic and social value to China. At the end of 2016, the value of China's annual output from wildlife breeding was estimated to exceed 520 billion yuan with the industry employing over 14 million people, 48 many of whom are unskilled rural workers operating family businesses. 49 The wildlife industry has been an important means of lifting rural people out of poverty. Wild animals in China are bred for food, medicine, exhibition, the pet trade and scientific research. Most workers are employed in the fur and food industries. 50 Animals legally bred have included mammals such as antelope, badger, bear, civet, coypu, deer, ferret, fox, hamster, macaque, mink, muskrat, pangolin, porcupine, rat, raccoon dog, rhino, squirrel, tiger, wild boar; birds, such as canary, emu, finch, guinea fowl, ostrich, parrot, partridge, peacock, pheasant, quail; and a variety of reptiles and amphibians (crocodile, snake, turtle and frog). 51 Some species are bred for multiple purposes.",

            "text": "On 24 February 2020, in the wake of COVID-19, the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress announced a ban on the hunting, breeding, trading, transporting and consumption of wild animals for food. 52 Prior to the ban, only state-protected species had any protection from being sold for food under the Wildlife Protection Law and even those could be sold for food, if the government deemed their breeding populations stable enough to permit it and the animals were sold with special markings to determine origin. 53 Species not enjoying state protection could be farmed and eaten, subject to provisions in China's Wildlife Protection Law, Animal Husbandry Law and Animal Epidemic Prevention Law controlling hunting, breeding and quarantine. legalisation of the use of even nationally protected animals in trade has helped to develop strong markets in China for deer antler wine, frozen crocodile meat and wine tonics made from various big cat bones. Breeding of wildlife also supports the expanding TCM industry which utilises musk, bear bile, pangolin scales, tiger bone and rhino horn as key ingredients. 54 The February 2020 ban on the consumption of wild animals relates only to terrestrial species. 55 Aquatic animals may still be farmed and sold for food, including stateprotected endangered species on the National Key Protected Aquatic Wild Animals for Farming List, such as the Chinese giant salamander (a CITES Appendix I listed species). With regard to terrestrial animals, it was initially unclear whether the government would permit some wild animals of mixed use, such as mink, fox and the raccoon dog, to continue to be farmed only for pelts or if their carcasses would be permitted to be sold for food. A consultation document drafted by the Ministry for Agriculture and Rural Affairs in early April suggested they could be farmed for fur only. 56 Civet cats and bamboo rats may no longer be farmed for food. It is unclear whether civets will continue to be permitted to be farmed for fur and TCM. Bear bile, saiga horn and pangolin scales from approved sources are expected to continue to be permitted to be bred and used for TCM under Article 29 of the Wildlife Protection Law and article 1 of the Traditional Chinese Medicine Law, which guarantees and promotes the development of TCM. The February 2020 ban specifically permits the continued use of wild animals for scientific research, medical use, and display, although it suggests that these will be subject to strict inspection, approval and quarantine measures. 57 A Notification by the National Forestry and Grasslands Administration issued on 8 April 2020 encouraged officials to support those farming wild animals for food to transition to breeding their animals for use in scientific research, traditional Chinese medicine or exhibitions. 58 In May 2020, Hunan was the first to introduce a province-wide policy providing compensation to all wildlife farmers who chose to cease operations involving prohibited animals, or move to raising permissible species only. 59 On 27 May 2020, the Ministry for Agriculture and Rural Affairs published a list of species which could continue to be raised domestically under approval of the State Council and pursuant to Article 11 of the Animal Husbandry Law 2005. The new 'National Catalogue of Livestock and Poultry Genetic Resources' includes pigs, cattle, zebu, water buffalo, domestic yaks, gaur, sheep, goats, horses, donkeys, camels, rabbits, chickens, ducks, geese, turkeys, pigeons, quails, sika deer, red deer, reindeer, alpaca, guinea fowl, ring-necked pheasant, partridge, mallard, ostrich, rhea, emu, mink, blue fox, Arctic fox and racoon-dog. 60 This list is expected to be confirmed when the Wildlife Protection Law is formally amended in late 2020. 61 Meanwhile, some parts of the country have begun to announce penalties for consumption of animals outside of the list. Shenzhen has increased its penalties for illegally consuming protected species to fines of between 5 and 30 times the value of the animals. 62 Tianjin has declared fines should be between 2 and 10 times the animal's value 63 and authorities in Guangdong province have stated offenders who consume species protected under the Wildlife Protection Law should be fined between 2 and 20 times the species value, and 1 and 5 times the value of non-protected but prohibited species. 64 It is important to note that the market value of animals plays an important part in the Chinese legal system for determining the seriousness of legal offending. In 2017, the State Forestry Administration published a list evaluating captive bred wild animals at half the value of their wild bred counterparts, for the purposes of determining their value in confiscation. 65 The value table is used by the courts to determine the seriousness of a wildlife crime and resulted in the Supreme People's Court publishing an opinion in 2000, which reduced sentencing tariffs for the illegal sale of captive bred wildlife (when compared with wild caught). 66 The idea that wild animals become domestic animals once they are captive bred has been a longstanding problem in addressing illegal trade in China. Once a poached wild animal is placed in a wildlife farm, it is considered, under the Wildlife Protection Law, to have become a domestic animal, which legalises its sale. Relying on this distinction, traders pushing back against the February 2020 ban have argued that the wild animals they breed are 'domesticated livestock' and accordingly should be legal to sell. 67",

The virus spread globally, infecting 8098 people and killing 774. 78 The outbreak of the virus was linked to the culinary habits of some southern Chinese who consumed wild game meat (hunted or farmed) as a delicacy. 79 People whose jobs involved the handling, slaughter, and sale of wild animals made up 39% of earliest cases recorded (January 2003 or earlier). Early patients were also significantly more likely than those who developed the virus in later months to be living close to markets where live wild animals were sold. 80 Two studies, which took place in January 2004, after the re-emergence of the virus in Guangdong, linked stressful conditions in wildlife markets to the spread of SARS-CoV. In each study, the authors observed a wide variety of species confined in small wire cages stacked on top of one another across the market. The first study, which sampled 18 civets found 78% positive for SARS-CoV. The authors concluded that stress caused to the animals by overcrowding and mixing of species at the market increased their already high susceptibility to the virus. 85 The second study, which tested 91 civets and 15 racoon dogs at the same market, found that 100% of the animals had the virus. The same study found that virus load increased with the length of time the animals spent at market, reaching a peak at 7 days. 86 Lack of welfare protection may compromise the physiological capacity of farmed animals to cope with stressful conditions on farms, in transport, at markets and at slaughter. In China, as in many parts of the world, live animals are sold at markets, to ensure they are fresh for consumption. In large markets, wild and domestic animals may be caged close to species with which they would not normally be in contact. Stress from transport, proximity to other animals and to humans may increase the accumulation of viral loads and risk of zoonosis. 87 Stress caused by poor animal welfare standards are known to cause immunosuppression, promoting the spread of disease. 88 Contrarily, positive welfare can help to protect individuals against disease. 89 While national laws have been passed in China, which seeks to prevent the spread of OIE-listed diseases, the State Council has continued to overlook the fact that animal health and welfare are linked and both must be successfully addressed for the safety of animal and public health. Chapter 7 of the OIE's Code underscores to members that the scientific assessment of animal welfare has progressed rapidly in recent years and forms the basis of the Code's recommendations. 90 Article 7.1.2 of the Code reminds member states that there is a critical relationship between animal health and animal welfare. Each affects the other. However, despite years of internal debate, China has yet to pass a national law promoting animal welfare and providing criminal sanctions for welfare abuses. This omission has helped delay the drafting and enforcement of positive welfare standards for farmed species. ",

Unless they fall into the sixth category and have special state protection under the Wildlife Law, wild animals enjoy almost no protection in China from ill-treatment. The few welfare standards China has for wild animals in captivity are focused on the special stateprotected species bred for scientific research, TCM, public exhibition or performances, heritage conservation and other state sanctioned purposes. Article 26 is the only provision in the Wildlife Protection Law which states that wild animals should have the necessary living space and conditions required to protect their reproduction, hygiene and health. However, it is limited in application to the breeding of special state-protected species, the vast majority of which it is illegal to sell for food. Even for special state-protected species, the most highly protected of all animals under Chinese law, the few prescriptive guidelines clarifying the welfare standards they should receive are rarely enforced 93 and have no criminal sanctions on breach.",

Perceived economic benefits have led to the few welfare related laws that have been promulgated. They exist to promote the successful breeding of key state protected species used for state endorsed purposes, such as TCM, or result from attempts to protect food safety and increase productivity.

Benefitting domestic species in many jurisdictions are welfare protections which, when properly enforced, can reduce the risk of immunosuppression and disease and act as safeguards against zoonosis.

            "text": "At an international level, in the absence of a Convention to protect wild animal health and welfare, the OIE should take the lead and use its current mandate to protect animal health and welfare to move wild animal protection (whether captive or free-living) to a global priority in all its member states/countries. The OIE advocates the 'One Health' concept which emphasises the interdependence of human and animal health and their reliance on the health of the ecosystems in which they exist. 106 The concept gained momentum after the SARS-CoV epidemic in 2003 and is commonly utilised in policy responses to zoonotic infections and food safety. 107 Along with the OIE, the concept has been endorsed by the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations (FAO), the World Health Organisation (WHO), United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) and the World Bank. 108 In 2008, the OIE, WHO and FAO published a collaborative document entitled 'Zoonotic Diseases: A Guide to Establishing Collaboration between Animal and Human Health Sectors at the Country Level'. The guide was used by WHO South-East Asia and Western Pacific Region countries to implement 'One Health' activities under the WHO's Asia Pacific Strategy for Emerging Diseases. However, in 2019, when the three organisations published their follow-up document: 'A Tripartite Guide to Addressing Zoonotic Diseases in Countries', 109 they noted that 'most countries have inadequate mechanisms in place for administrative and technical collaboration among the animal health, public health, and environment sectors'. 110 Mainstreaming and implementing a 'One Health' approach was also recently endorsed in a joint report released in July 2020 by the United Nations Environment Programme 111 and the International Livestock Research Institute, in response the COVID-19 outbreak. Their report: 'Preventing the Next Pandemic: Zoonotic Diseases and How to Break the Chain of Transmission' cites trade in wild animals and their sale and slaughter in poorly managed and unhygienic markets as pathways for future pathogen transmissions. 112 The report links SARS-CoV and COVID-19 with the intensification of wildlife breeding in China, poor biosecurity on farms and the laundering of illegally sourced wildlife through government supported trade. 113 SARS-CoV is now thought likely to have originated in insectivorous bats, probably spreading through civets sold at live animal markets to humans. 114 The report recommends the strengthening of sanitary controls along the entire supply chain in wild animal trade and the adoption of animal welfare standards in the care, housing and transport of both wild and domestic species and the prohibition of trade in high-risk species. 115 As far as wild animal health is concerned, the OIE established a Working Group on Wildlife Diseases which focuses on wild animals (both captive and free-living) in 1994. 116 While the OIE has provided guidelines on both health and welfare to prevent the spread of zoonotic disease in livestock it had not, until the epidemic occurred, addressed the need to provide similar recommendations for the farming of wild species. Responding to the pandemic in April 2020, the OIE announced the development of guidelines or standards for trade in wildlife to reduce health risks and to promote 'sustainable and responsible practices in legal trade, transportation, capture, farming, marketing, and consumption of wildlife'. 117 Overlapping with the 'One Health' concept has been the development of the 'One Welfare' concept. 'One Welfare' asserts that human welfare, social welfare and animal welfare are not distinct disciplines and need to be addressed in a holistic manner if emerging social challenges related to global public health are to be adequately addressed. 118 It notes that poor animal welfare can impact health, including suppressing immune system functioning 119 and, in the context of food production, the safeguarding of animal welfare has important benefits for human welfare by improving food safety. 120 Extending the 'One Health' concept beyond clinical aspects, the 'One Welfare' approach encourages policy makers to integrate their approaches to animal health, animal welfare and human well-being.",

            "text": "Some international conventions would strengthen their impact on the threat of zoonosis by adopting the 'One Health' and 'One Welfare' approaches. With regard to international trade, a more permissive interpretation of the CITES text would assist by taking greater account of the need to protect animal health and welfare in what is permitted in live international trade in endangered species. As noted in Part 1.1 above, the Convention's text has very little to say on the welfare of the animals traded under its auspices. The only articles that relate to the welfare protection of animals in trade, under CITES, relate to the requirement that their packaging and In the wake of COVID-19, the need to ensure positive welfare at all stages of the supply chain, for the sake of animal health, may be less controversial. The links between wildlife trade and the spread of disease have already been expressly recognised in CITES decisions. At the 26th meeting of the Animals Committee held in Geneva and Dublin in 2012, the Committee observed three risk areas linked to the implementation of CITES. 123 The first of these recognised that wildlife in trade may spread disease globally. With regard to animal transport, the Secretariat of the Convention has urged member states to adopt the IATA Live Animals Regulations for air transport and the CITES Guidelines for the Non-Air Transport of Live Wild Animals and Plants. The Guidelines were adopted at the CITES CoP16 in Bangkok in 2013. 124 The Guidelines recognise that transport is an unnatural situation for an animal and may cause it stress. High levels of stress may increase susceptibility to diseases. The Guidelines provide guidance to shippers as to how to minimise stress to animals in transport with species specific advice provided for some animals. However, as the text of the Convention does not require it, adoption of the Regulations and Guidelines is not a mandatory obligation and, to date, few states have legislated to require compliance with them. 125 Other Resolutions have also sought to limit the risk of spreading disease in trade under CITES. Resolution of the Conference 9.24 (Rev CoP15) provides that in assessing the need to list an animal for protection, consideration of its vulnerability to extinction should include an assessment of the species susceptibility to threats from disease. 126 Most recently, Resolution of the Conference 17.8, passed in 2016 in South Africa, recognised that: Animals held in captivity/transported, even for a very short period of time, may be exposed to a variety of pathogens. Release of these animals into the wild may result in introduction of disease to conspecifics or unrelated species with potentially catastrophic effects. . .While some diseases can be tested for, tests do not exist for many animal diseases. Furthermore, animals held in 121 CITES (n 2). captivity are frequently exposed to diseases not usually encountered in their natural habitat. 127 However, while useful for protecting endangered animals, re-interpreting CITES mandates to promote good health and welfare, preferably from the point of capture would not benefit the many wild species in international trade which are not endangered. While it is not yet known which animal was the host species for COVID-19, the two species which have been linked to SARS-CoV by most researchers were not endangered. Neither horseshoe bats (thought to be a potential reservoir for the virus that caused SARS-CoV) nor the masked palm civet (the most likely species through which SARS-CoV infected humans), are listed in the CITES appendices. Furthermore, like the majority of wild animals sold in China for local consumption, both species do not need to be imported. While a more permissive reading of CITES would benefit endangered species in international trade, CITES has no jurisdiction over domestic trade, even for Appendices I and II listed species. Observing this distinction, China has consistently asserted past CITES resolutions which have sought to limit captive breeding of tigers within their jurisdiction fall outside of the CITES remit.",

While proportionate health measures to promote the SPS Agreement are not a trade restriction, 134 there has been controversy as to whether the imposition of higher welfare standards in production methods is similarly protected from criticism. 135 It has been argued that as Article 5.2 of the SPS Agreement permits production methods to be considered in risk assessments for health, parties wishing to promote high animal welfare standards, as measures taken under the Agreement, might do so by relying on the scientific links between animal health and animal welfare. 136 Article 2.2 provides that measures taken must be based on scientific principles. The OIE has, in its Terrestrial Animal Health Code 2019, recognised the impacts of poor welfare on animal health, and set animal welfare standards for animals in transport (Chapters 7.2-7.4), in production systems (Chapters 7.09-7.14) and at slaughter (Chapter 7.5). Arguably the application of these standards, which are based on scientific assessments, would justify trade restrictions. 137 However, that interpretation has yet to be tested and, in the case of China would have limited repercussions for animal welfare. China exports few live animals and most of its trade is with Hong Kong. 138 Any ban on animal exports from China on animal health or welfare grounds would need to be widespread to exert significant enough pressure for reform.",

The Universal Declaration of Animal Welfare 139 (UDAW) prepared by The World Society for the Protection of Animals (now World Animal Protection) and presented at the Animals World Congress in June 2000 could provide a starting point from which to work. 140 The UDAW promotes the welfare of sentient animals of all species (whether wild or domestic, captive or free-living). 141 It was formally adopted by the International Committee of the OIE in 2007 on the basis that the Declaration would 'complement and promote the work of the OIE, and facilitate global acceptance of OIE standards and their application at a national, regional and global level'. 142 According to World Animal Protection's website the Declaration has been endorsed by 40 governments to date. 143 Success in meeting the aim to have UDAW accepted by the United Nations might finally provide the springboard for an enforceable international treaty for animal welfare, 144 as was mooted in the 1980's but ultimately rejected. 145",

In the black market, safeguards promoting animal welfare are irrelevant as the legal rules will not be followed. Animals poached, and in some cases also smuggled across borders, circumvent the health safeguards provided by quarantine measures and can ignore welfare controls. Traders who breed animals without licences and sell them on the black market or disguise their origin to sell them in the legal market are unlikely to defer to regulatory requirements. However, that is not to say that imposing welfare safeguards for animals in legal trade would have no impact on the black market. The introduction of welfare standards would necessarily involve heightened scrutiny of the live animal trade in order to ensure those standards were being met. Increased regulatory oversight is an important tool in deterring offenders. 146 Some wild caught animals are targeted because customers prefer them to captive bred, as occurs in the wild meat trade. 147 Others are taken from the wild as it is cheaper to poach than farm. 148 Where there is no economic advantage to illegal traders in identifying their animals as wild caught, they may be laundered in legal markets allowing the species to be traded. 149 Illegally sourced animals may be sold alongside legally bred ones on the assumption that poached specimens or those bred in breach of licensing conditions will not be distinguishable from those that have been legally bred. 150 Increased inspection of wildlife trading facilities, and the animals sold from them, would help improve the detection of illegal trade. Where inspections detect poor welfare in animals offered for sale and traders cannot produce the requisite quarantine papers and certificates of origin to establish their legality, investigators may uncover evidence of illegal trading. Where such cases are prosecuted, convictions can assist in deterring further offending.",

In failing to address these issues within their own borders, sovereign states have fuelled the illegal transnational trade in wildlife to become the fourth most lucrative black market in the world. 153 There has been growing recognition of the need for an international response to the problem. CITES collaborates with the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, the World Bank, INTERPOL and the World Customs Organisation through the International Consortium on Combating Wildlife Crime to try to encourage more effective domestic and regional responses to the problem. The COVID-19 pandemic has provided the impetus for the international community to support a more aggressive global response. In 2019, a suggestion was made by John Scanlon, former Secretary General of CITES that wildlife crime should be added as a protocol under the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organised Crime (UNTOC). 154 On 14 October 2020, the Global Initiative to End Wildlife Crime, which is chaired by Scanlon, released a draft of its suggested protocol. Parties to the protocol would be required to criminalise the trafficking of wild animals or plants taken in breach of international agreements to which they are a party or taken in breach of domestic or foreign laws. Parties would also be required to agree to exchange information concerning organised crime related to wildlife trafficking, share forensic samples, assist one another to verify the validity of documents, enhance border controls and act to deter demand for illegal wildlife products. If adopted, the protocol would become the fourth Protocol to the UNTOC.",

Public demand for wildlife consumption in Mainland China continued post SARS-CoV. A study before and after SARS-CoV of 1,000 residents in Hunan province, an area where wild meats are widely consumed, recorded almost no change to public attitudes towards the consumption of masked palm civets. The study found that people's interest in eating masked palm civet in 2004 had a non-significant decline of less than 1%, when compared with 2002, before the epidemic. 158 This was despite nearly 40% of respondents agreeing that masked palm civets were the likely carriers of SARS-CoV. 159 Early research interest in the origins of the virus waned after it failed to support high levels of human transmission 160 and in China, civet breeding continued to be promoted as a government supported enterprise right up to the outbreak of COVID-19. As part of its support to the industry, the Forestry Bureau in each province is responsible for providing domestication and breeding permits, business licences and sale and transport permits for wild animals. A report on the website of the Forestry Bureau in Jiangxi province in November 2019 stated that the Bureau had provided 200,000 yuan in subsidies to encourage farmers to pivot to breeding wildlife and lift themselves out of poverty. In Wan'an County in Jiangxi province alone, 9.5 million yuan has been invested by the government in infrastructure to support civet breeding. At the end of 2018, the province had reported annual revenue of 10 billion yuan from wildlife farming. 161 Whilst calls have been made to ban the global wildlife trade completely and permanently, the economic and social costs make this outcome unlikely. In the absence of a blanket prohibition, targeted risk management measures must be introduced to effectively address the problems highlighted by the pandemic. Within China, permanent bans on the trade and consumption of known high risk species, such as the masked palm civet and horseshoe bat, improved surveillance of animal health and compensation for those forced to leave the wildlife farming industry should all be explored.",

The breeding and slaughter of wild animals, whatever their purpose, carries risks for zoonotic disease. In a joint proposal submitted to the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress in March 2020, nine professors in environmental law from universities across China, called on the Chinese legislature to prohibit the captive breeding of wild animals for any purpose, including medicinal, pointing out that some high risk animals, such as civets, are bred for food, medicine and fur production. 166 In an open letter to the WHO on World Health Day 2020, 339 animal welfare and conservation organisations urged the WHO to unequivocally exclude the use of wildlife, including from captive-bred specimens, from the WHO's definition and endorsement of TCM, citing the risks of disease transmission from all aspects of the trade. 167 Leaving aside the question of disease, there are important conservation reasons to restrict the wildlife farming of certain species. The farming of endangered species for TCM is known to fuel poaching and has been implicated in the laundering of species targeted in the illegal wildlife trade. 168 Tiger breeding farms in China play a significant role in the continuing illicit sale of tiger bone medicines locally and internationally. 169 Farming of reptiles is also known to stimulate illegal trade 170 and has driven some endangered turtles within China to extinction. 171 While CITES rules allow captive bred Appendix I species to be traded as if they are Appendix II species, 172 wildlife farming of endangered species for use in TCM flouts the spirit of the Convention. CITES has long advocated that Appendix I species should not be bred for commercial purposes. 173 Several resolutions and decisions have been taken seeking to control China's captive tiger breeding operations on the basis that the tiger trade fuels poaching and threatens wild populations. 174 Banning the breeding of endangered species for TCM in China would make an important contribution to the protection of endangered species internationally as well as assist in preventing zoonosis by reducing the impetus for smuggling.",

If the risks of zoonosis are to be effectively contained, criminally enforceable welfare standards for farmed species under the Animal Husbandry Law and the Wildlife Protection Law must be legislated and enforced. 181 Further, given the significant role the farming of wildlife for TCM and other special purposes plays in driving poaching and the increased zoonosis risks which arise from the smuggling of wild animals for any purpose, trade in high-risk species in China, for any form of human consumption, should be banned completely.",
