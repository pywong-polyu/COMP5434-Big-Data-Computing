Methods: In this prospective study, we enrolled 108 patients who were followed up every 3-6 months and at onset of exacerbations between March 2017 and November 2018. Spontaneous sputum was split for detection of bacteria (routine culture) and viruses (quantitative polymerase chain reaction). Symptoms and lung function were assessed during exacerbations. Results: The median exacerbation rate was 2.0 (interquartile range: 1.0-2.5) per patient-year. At any visit, viral isolations (V+) occurred more frequently during onset of exacerbations [odds ratio (OR): 3.28, 95% confidence interval (95%CI): 1.76-6.12], as did isolation of new bacteria (NB+) (OR: 2.52, 95%CI: 1.35-4.71) and bacterial plus viral isolations (OR: 2.24, 95%CI: 1.11-4.55). Whilst coryza appeared more common in exacerbations with V+ than in exacerbations with no pathogen isolations and those with NB+, lower airway symptoms were more severe in exacerbations with NB+ (P < .05). Sputum interleukin-1\u2424 levels were higher in exacerbations with NB+ than in exacerbations with no pathogen isolations and those with V+ (both P < .05). Significantly more coryza symptoms correlated with bacterial plus viral isolations at exacerbations (P = .019). Compared with V+ alone, bacterial with and without viral isolations tended to yield more severe lower airway symptoms, but not sputum cytokine levels at exacerbations. Conclusions: Viral isolations, isolation of new bacteria and bacterial plus viral isolation are associated with bronchiectasis exacerbations. Symptoms at exacerbations might inform clinicians the possible culprit pathogens.",

However, the total bacterial load and microbiota taxa, analyzed by 16s rDNA sequencing, changed unremarkably before and after antibiotic treatment for AEs. 13 Intriguingly, isolation of new bacterial strain (Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, or Streptococcus pneumoniae) was associated with increased risks of COPD exacerbations. [28] [29] [30] Our study showed that isolation of new bacteria (mainly Haemophilus influenzae) was associated with AEs in bronchiectasis, implicating that Pseudomonas aeruginosa was not the culprit of AEs and that antibiotic therapy targeting at the emerging bacterial species would be warranted. Hence, rapid microbiological assessments are important to clinical practice because they may help avoid over-treatment or under-treatment. Viral isolations occurred more frequently in AEs. The viral detection rate was lower (30%) than previously reported (\u223c48%). 11, 12 The sources of samples (sputum vs. nasopharyngeal aspirates vs. sputum plus nasopharyngeal swab) and the characteristics of bronchiectasis patients might have contributed to the differences. The most prevalent viruses were influenza A/B, coronavirus and rhinovirus in our population, congruent with the findings from COPD patients in Hong Kong. 31 Influenza A/B and rhinovirus, but not coronavirus, played crucial roles in AEs. However, the mechanisms underlying these observations are unclear and warrant further investigations. Overall, our findings mirrored those reported in adults and children. 11, 12 Compared with the study by Mitchell et al., 32 the difference in viral spectrum could have resulted from the differences in: (1) detection methods and assay kits; (2) the positive threshold of CT values; (3) the geographic regions.",

Indeed, viral isolation may induce secondary bacterial isolation and further aggravated inflammation. 33, 34 However, the load of Pseudomonas aeruginosa did not increase significantly regardless of viral isolation status or disease status (exacerbation vs. steady-state) in cystic fibrosis. 35, 36 Moreover, respiratory syncytial virus isolation reportedly enhanced Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilm growth, rendering Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection more sustainable. 37 Collectively, Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolation was unlikely the trigger of AEs despite co-existing viral isolations in bronchiectasis. This is the first study which analyzed the association between symptoms and AEs in bronchiectasis because this would help clinicians more rapidly identify the possible culprits. Coryza symptoms were indicators of viral isolations. Fever was ubiquitous in different types of AEs, hence viral AEs cannot be judged based on fever alone.

Our sample size was insufficient to power subgroup analyses. Some blood tests, spirometry were not available because some patients declined due to repeated assessments and poor overall well-being during AEs. We've only captured half AE episodes although the clinical characteristics of these patients did not differ from those whose AEs were not captured. Furthermore, we did not measure bacterial loads which reportedly changed insignificantly during AEs. 11 The AEs were managed at out-patient clinics, hence our findings might not be extrapolated to severe AEs needing hospitalization. Some viruses detected during AEs might not be pathogenic; however, the GEE model did reveal the association between pathogen isolation and AEs. Finally, findings of the symptoms associated with viral or bacterial isolations were not specific to bronchiectasis. However, our study would still be informative because our findings help clinicians to infer from possible culprit pathogens before further assays became available.",
