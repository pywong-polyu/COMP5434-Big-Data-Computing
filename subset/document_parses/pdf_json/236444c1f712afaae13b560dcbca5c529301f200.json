TCRs can be sequenced from individuals and methods analyzing the specificity of the TCRs can help us better understand individuals' immune status in different disorders. For this task, we have developed TCRGP, a novel Gaussian process method that predicts if TCRs recognize specified epitopes. TCRGP can utilize the amino acid sequences of the complementarity determining regions (CDRs) from TCR\u03b1 and TCR\u03b2 chains and learn which CDRs are important in recognizing different epitopes. Our comprehensive evaluation with epitope-specific TCR sequencing data shows that TCRGP achieves on average higher prediction accuracy in terms of AUROC score than existing state-of-the-art methods in epitope-specificity predictions. We also propose a novel analysis approach for combined single-cell RNA and TCR\u03b1\u03b2 (scRNA+TCR\u03b1\u03b2) sequencing data by quantifying epitope-specific TCRs with TCRGP and identify HBV-epitope specific T cells and their transcriptomic states in hepatocellular carcinoma patients.",

            "text": "Humans have dedicated cells called T cells that recognize potentially harmful invaders using T cell receptors (TCRs) and protect us from infections. Each person has billions of T cells and millions of different kinds of TCRs that enable us to recognize a large variety of invaders. When for example a virus enters the body, T cells with TCRs recognizing that virus multiply and fight it. After such attacks, T cells that recognized the virus, remain in the body, forming an immunological memory. T cells thus characterize a person's infection history, but in order to reveal it, we need to determine which epitopes, molecular signatures of the invaders, different TCRs can recognize. We can characterize which TCRs recognize certain epitopes experimentally, but this is a time and sample consuming task and is not often possible with scarce patient samples such as biopsies. However, previously produced experimental data has enabled us to develop a computational method, TCRGP, that can predict which epitopes a TCR recognizes with a higher accuracy than previous Introduction The adaptive immune system implements various complex mechanisms for surveillance against both pathogens and pathological cells arising in our body. To initiate an adequate adaptive immune response, a peptide, called epitope, must first be bound by the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I or II molecule expressed on the surface of a nucleated cell or a professional antigen-presenting cell, respectively. The peptide-MHC (pMHC) complex is then presented to T cells which can recognize the complex via T cell receptor (TCR) proteins, consequently leading to T cell activation and proliferation by clonal expansion [1] . During clonal expansion, a fraction of T cells gain a long-living memory phenotype and therefore a clonal population of T cells with identical TCR rearrangements remain for years against the recognized antigen [2] , thus forming a potentially decodable immunological signature. Learning these signatures could have implications in broad range of clinical applications including infectious diseases, autoimmunity and tumor immunology. T cells undergo non-homologous recombination during T cell development, which involves rearrangement of the germline TCR loci from a large collection of variable (V), diversity (D) and joining (J) gene segments as well as template-independent insertions and deletions at the V-D and D-J junctions [3, 4] . TCRs are formed by a pair of \u03b1-and \u03b2-chains (90-95% of T cells) or \u03b3 and \u03b4-chains (5-10%) and V(D)J recombination happens in each locus independently. It is estimated that this rearrangement can result in the range of 10 18 different TCR genes [5, 6] which provides enormous diversity for epitope-specific T cell repertoires.",

High-throughput sequencing of V-and J-segment enriched DNA has enabled large-scale characterization of TCR sequences, initially only for the CDR3\u03b2 with bulk methods [6, 12] but recently for the whole paired TCR\u03b1\u03b2 at single-cell resolution using plate or droplet-based methods [13, 14] . Nevertheless, profiling of epitope-specific TCRs remains exhaustive as they require sample-consuming experiments with distinct pMHC-multimers for each epitope of interest. Therefore, there is a great need for models that examine which epitopes a TCR can recognize or to which TCRs an epitope can bind to [15] . Curated databases of experimentally verified TCR-peptide interactions have recently been launched, such as VDJdb, IEDB, and McPAS [16] [17] [18] . Such data sources enable more comprehensive, data-driven analysis of TCR-peptide interactions, and allow the use of statistical machine learning techniques for the aforementioned tasks. Yet only a few computational methods for predicting recognition between TCRs and epitopes [10, [19] [20] [21] [22] and for clustering similar TCRs [9, 23, 24] have been published. In addition to supervised and unsupervised methods for predicting TCR-epitope interactions, computational methods and web services such as [25] have also been proposed to predict the structure of TCRs based on their amino acid sequences.",

Indeed, TCRGP clearly outperforms the current state-of-the art methods for predicting the epitope specificity of TCRs. At the same time TCRGP can scale to exploit extremely large data sets of epitope-specific TCRs, which we expect to become more common in the future. We also analyze the effects of utilizing different sections of the TCR amino acid sequence and learn which of them are most important and examine how the number of TCRs used for training affects the predictions. Finally, we demonstrate the potential of TCRGP by analyzing single-cell RNA+TCR\u03b1\u03b2-sequencing data from hepatocellular carcinoma patients.",

            "text": "Gaussian processes (GP) are a flexible class of models that have become popular in machine learning and statistics with various applications in molecular biology, bioinformatics and other fields [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] . We have developed TCRGP, a GP based probabilistic classifier which can be trained to predict TCRs' specificity to any epitope given sufficient training data for the specified epitope. GPs implement a Bayesian nonparametric kernel method for learning from data. They differ from standard parametric models in that instead of learning the parameters of a predefined function, they define priors for the entire class of nonlinear functions and learn a suitable function for the prediction task. Properties of GPs are defined by the kernel function, which is a function of objects that we want to classify. TCRGP uses Gaussian process classification with variational inference [31, 32] To train a GP classifier for predicting if TCRs recognize a certain epitope, a set of training data consisting of TCRs that are known to recognize and to not recognize that epitope are required. TCRGP can utilize CDR3 amino acid sequences from both TCR \u03b1-and \u03b2-chains as well as CDR1, CDR2, and CDR2.5 sequences which can be determined from V\u03b1-and V\u03b2genes. The different CDRs are then aligned within each CDR type using the IMGT definitions and a numerical presentation of them is formed using principal components of a modified BLOSUM62 substitution matrix (see Fig 1A) .",

For comparison, we also trained TCRdist [10] in the same manner. Fig  2B shows that both methods, TCRGP and TCRdist, perform on average better when using TCR\u03b2 than when using TCR\u03b1, although using both \u03b1-and \u03b2-chains generally provides the best results. There are few exceptions, as shown in Fig 2B-2D and S1 Fig and Table 1 . For example, with epitope pp65 both methods perform better when using CDR3\u03b1 instead of CDR3\u03b2. Overall TCRGP is better than TCRdist in utilizing information from CDRs other than CDR3. TCRGP achieves higher AUROC scores on average when trained using all CDRs instead of only CDR3, whereas with TCRdist the AUROC scores seem to be similar or better when only CDR3 is utilized. Notably TCRGP outperforms TCRdist in prediction accuracy for 57 of the 60 comparisons (Table 1 and S1 Fig). To quantify the significance of accuracy differences between different methods, we applied Wilcoxon signed-rank test to paired AUROC scores across epitopes. We used the test to study three questions: do AUROC scores differ between TCRGP and previous methods, is it better to use all CDRs or only CDR3s, and which chains should be used to produce best results. The Benjamini-Hochberg corrected P-values for these tests can be found from S2 File. These results support the above observations: TCRGP outperforms TCRdist, with TCRGP it is beneficial to use all CDRs, and the use of \u03b2 chain generally gives better AUROC scores than \u03b1 chain, although it is best to use both chains. It is noteworthy, that although Dash et al. [10] use leave-one-subject-out control, the results shown here differ somewhat from their results. The differences are likely caused by differences in the background TCRs as we have selected them randomly from the larger set of background TCRs provided by Dash et al. Fig 2B-2D , Table 1 , and S1 Fig also show that the AUROC scores can have notable differences between different epitopes even when the same combinations of CDRs and \u03b1/\u03b2 chains have been utilized. Some of these differences may be explained by the differences in the number of available training samples, for example for CMV-epitope pp65 495-503 there were only 76 TCRs from 6 subjects in the Dash data, which may have contributed to a lower prediction accuracy. To address this, we evaluated the models also using leave-one-out cross-validation with only unique, private TCRs to see how the models perform when predictions are done only on new TCRs. With both TCRGP and TCRdist, the average AUROC scores improve slightly (S3 Fig), demonstrating that the models can predict if completely new TCR sequences are specific to these epitopes and that the larger number of TCRs used for training (due to the larger folds in leave-one-out cross validation) improve the model performances. A summary of all prediction results is shown in S1 File.",

As one might expect, with most of the epitopes most weight was given to the CDR3\u03b2, but with all epitopes some weight was also given to other CDRs, suggesting that the classifier benefits from utilizing several CDRs. This is in agreement with an alignment of 52 TCR sequences from TCR-pMHC PDB structure complexes, which demonstrates that all CDRs can be within 5\u00c5 of a peptide [9] .

(E) Fractions of total weight given to kernels corresponding to different CDRs, when TCRGP has been trained to predict which TCRs are specific to the epitopes in the Dash data using all CDRs from both TCR chains. CDR3\u03b2, CDR1\u03b2, CDR3\u03b1 and CDR1\u03b1 to be within 5\u00c5 of the peptide, and also CDR2\u03b2 within 5.8\u00c5 of the peptide. Another TCR-pMHC-complex structure (PDBid 5D2L) for the same pp65 495-503 -epitope suggests that CDR2\u03b2 was also within 5 \u00c5 of the peptide. Indeed, the optimized weights for the pp65 495-503 -epitope ( Fig 2C) show some correspondence to the observed contacts. Although with many epitopes CDR3\u03b2 was considered as the most important CDR, this was not the case with all epitopes. For example with mCMV-epitope m139 419-426 CDR3\u03b1 is more important for the prediction, while with EBV-epitope BMLF1 280-288 most of the weight was given to CDR2\u03b1 and CDR2\u03b2. Still, also with BMLF1 280-288 epitope the CDR3\u03b2 alone provided discriminative information, as demonstrated by the high AUROC score (0.818) when TCRGP was trained only with CDR3\u03b2-sequences (see Table 1 ",

            "text": "Currently only a few methods for predicting the epitope-specificity of TCRs have been published, including TCRdist [10] and a random forest (RF) classifier by De Neuter et al. [19] . TCRdist uses a BLOSUM62 based distance measure between amino acids and defines the distance between two (aligned) TCRs as a weighted sum over the amino acid distances. Using this distance measure, they determine if a TCR is closer to an epitope-specific cluster of TCRs or to a cluster of background TCRs. De Neuter et al. use feature vectors formed by biophysical and other features extracted from TCR amino acid sequences to train a RF classifier. Gielis et al. [33] have later published a web server TCRex that is based on the RF classifier. However, we have utilized the implementation from the original article to be able to train models with the same training sets as with the other models in the comparisons. More recently also methods relying on neural networks have been proposed, such as DeepTCR, NetTCR, and Ergo [20] [21] [22] . DeepTCR relies on convolutional networks and uses one-hot encoding to present CDR3 and V/D/J-genes from \u03b1-and \u03b2-chains, or a subset of these, to learn embeddings for the sequences. NetTCR, which is intended for HLA-A \ufffd 02:01 restricted epitopes, also uses convolutional neural networks, but utilizes BLOSUM50 encoding for presenting the CDR3\u03b2 and the epitope sequence. Ergo uses LSTM (long-short term memory) network to encode the peptide sequence and either LSTM or an autoencoder to encode the CDR3 and utilize feed forward networks for predictions. Here we provide comparisons between TCRGP, TCRdist, RF, and DeepTCR. To compare TCRGP to these other methods, we experimented with the VDJdb data and we again used leave-one-subject-out cross-validation as described in Materials and Methods Section. We trained TCRGP and TCRdist using only CDR3\u03b2 and then also with the other CDR\u03b2s. Fig 3A shows the ROC curves when TCRGP was trained with all CDR\u03b2s to predict which TCRs are specific to the HCV-epitope NS3 1436-1444 .",

RF could also utilize the J-gene and DeepTCR J-and D-genes, but unfortunately, the background TCR data set from Dash et al. [10] did not contain information of these genes. One violin plot presents the distribution estimate of mean AUROC scores obtained with one method for all epitopes in our VDJdb data. Below each violin plot there is the name of the method used and in the brackets which CDR\u03b2s have been used (3 for CDR3, all for CDR1, CDR2, CDR2.5, and CDR3). Each point within a violin plot presents the mean AUROC score obtained for one epitope. RF refers to the Random Forest TCR-classifier of De Neuter et al. [19] . RF using only CDR3\u03b2 has not been included in this figure as it could not provide predictions for all of the 22 epitopes. (C) Comparison of AUROC scores obtained with the different methods for each epitope separately. The epitopes have been arranged in increasing order of AUROC scores obtained by TCRGP using all CDR\u03b2s (orange line) (D) For each epitope from the VDJdb dataset, TCRGP models were trained using different numbers of unique epitope-specific TCR\u03b2s, always complemented with the same number of control TCR\u03b2s. For each point of the learning curve the model was trained with 100 random samples of the TCR\u03b2s, using either CDR1, CDR2, CDR2.5, and CDR3 (blue curves), or only CDR3 (orange curves). The darker lines show the mean of the predictions and the shaded areas \u00b1 the standard deviation for the 100 folds. The points indicate the tested sample sizes. Here learning curves for four peptides are shown. However, according to De Neuter et al., not much weight was given to the J-gene at least in their experiments. Moreover, when RF and DeepTCR utilize CDR3\u03b2 and V\u03b2-gene and TCRGP and TCRdist use all CDRs, all four methods get the same sequence information, although in a slightly different form, as the other CDR\u03b2s are derived from the V\u03b2-gene. Fig 3B shows the distribution estimates of mean AUROC scores for each model trained for the 22 different epitopes. With the VDJdb data, we can see that TCRGP and TCRdist both perform better, when all CDR\u03b2s have been utilized. Remarkably, TCRGP achieves higher mean AUROC scores than the other methods when using all CDRs, but also when only the CDR3\u03b2 is utilized. AUROC scores for the different epitopes are presented in Table 2 In the VDJdb data, there were also TCRs that appeared in samples collected from multiple subjects (see Table 3 ). We therefore trained the models also using leave-one-out cross-validation with only unique TCRs. In this case we considered a TCR to be unique if it had a unique combination of CDR3\u03b2 amino acid sequence and V\u03b2-gene, as we only utilized the TCR\u03b2. As with the Dash data above, our results (S5 and S6 Figs) show that the models can predict if completely new sequences are specific to these epitopes, thus demonstrating their use for Table 2 . Mean AUROC scores for the VDJdb data using leave-one-subject-out cross-validation. TCRGP models and TCRdist models were trained using TCR\u03b2 with either only CDR3\u03b2 or all CDR\u03b2s. RF models and DeepTCR models were trained using only CDR3\u03b2 or CDR3\u03b2 with V\u03b2-gene, from which the other CDR\u03b2s can be derived from. epitope specificity prediction for previously unseen TCRs. A summary of all prediction results is shown in S1 File. To affirm the above observations, we again applied Wilcoxon signed-rank test. We used the test to study two questions: do AUROC scores differ between TCRGP and previous methods, and is it better to use all CDR\u03b2s rather than only CDR3\u03b2s. The Benjamini-Hochberg corrected P-values for these tests (see S2 File) support the visual observations we made from Fig 3B. ",

These results also suggest that with many epitopes it may be more beneficial to sequence a moderate amount of TCRs in such precision that in addition to the CDR3 also the V-gene and allele (and thus the CDR1, CDR2, and CDR2.5) can be determined, than to sequence large amounts of only CDR3s. These findings are in line with the weights learned by TCRGP for each CDR3 for the individual epitopes, as we can see in the case of CMV-epitope pp65 495-503 , EBV-epitope BMLF1 280-288 and IAV-epitope M1 58-66 (see Fig 2) . With pp65 495-503 most weight was given to CDR3\u03b2 and thus information from other CDRs was not considered as beneficial; with BMLF1 280-288 almost no weight was given to CDR3\u03b2 and in the learning curves there is a clear improvement when all CDR\u03b2s are used; with M1 58-66 some weight was given to CDR3\u03b2, but most weight fell to CDR2\u03b2 and correspondingly there is a small improvement in the learning curves, when all CDR\u03b2s are utilized. Overall, the learning curves show that TCRGP can learn an accurate predictor even from a small data set, thus making it applicable to the currently existing TCR-peptide interaction data sets. On the other hand, our results also show that TCRGP's prediction accuracy increases along with increasing number of training examples, enabling analysis of larger TCR-peptide interaction data sets in the future.",

In fact, the mean AUROC scores in this case (0.794 and 0.821 when only CDR3\u03b2 and all CDR\u03b2s were used) are higher than the mean AUROC scores obtained for the same seven HLA-A \ufffd 02 restricted epitopes, when TCRs for all 22 epitopes were utilized (0.746 and 0.786, respectively), see S9 Fig. This analysis supports our finding that CDRs other than CDR3 contain information that is useful for predicting TCR-epitope recognition.

Globally the predominant cause of HCC is considered to be Hepatitis B virus (HBV) as half of the HCC patients are estimated to be chronic HBV carriers [36] . During the course of natural infection, HBV integrates itself into the genome of the hepatocytes and thus a proportion of the HCC cells expresses HBV antigens [37] . Therefore, the malignant cells could be targeted by HBVspecific T-cell clonotypes and the high-dimensional characterization of these clonotypes could be crucial in understanding the viral control of HBV-infection and its association to HCC. To address this previously unanswered question we used TCRGP to analyze a dataset of single-cell RNA and TCR\u03b1\u03b2 of T cells from HBsAg-positive HCC-patients from blood, non-malignant liver tissue and tumour tissue published by Zheng et al.

However, the exact number of TCRs required to achieve a certain level of accuracy varies greatly between the different epitopes. This likely reflects the fact that different epitopes can be more selective in choosing their TCR interactions. In other words, TCRs that recognize one epitope can be more diverse than the TCRs that recognize another epitope [10] , and if the TCRs are very heterogeneous, it requires more sampling to get a representative sample of these TCRs for the model training. In addition, we have shown that also CDRs other than CDR3\u03b2 can provide useful information for the classification task, although it depends on the epitope in question which of the CDRs are most important. Although computational methods cannot replace experimental measurements in determining exact epitope-specificities of TCRs, they may be used to complement them for example when analyzing existing unselected TCR repertoire data or to guide experimental designs for ex vivo measurements.",

We align the CDR3 sequence by adding a gap at the top of the loop, following the IMGT numbering [11] . Dash et al. [10] provide a table of all V-gene and allele combinations and the corresponding CDR1, CDR2, and CDR2.5 amino acid sequences aligned according to IMGT definitions [11] . Our method can utilize the aligned amino acid sequences of all these CDRs from either one or both of the \u03b1-and \u03b2-chains of the TCR. Datasets. In our experiments, we use a data set collected by Dash et al.

Every entry in VDJdb has been given a confidence score between 0 and 3 (0: critical information missing, 1: medium confidence, 2: high confidence, 3: very high confidence). We constructed our data set so that we selected all epitopes that have at least 50 TCR\u03b2 sequences with a confidence score at least 1 and found 22 such epitopes. Twenty of these epitopes are MCH class I restricted and two are MHC class II restricted and have varying HLA-types, see Table 3 for details. VDJdb also contains TCR\u03b1 sequences, but since these are not in general paired with the corresponding TCR\u03b2 sequences, we chose to only experiment with the TCR\u03b2 sequences. The VDJdb data and the Dash data have some overlap for TCRs specific to three epitopes: In the VDJdb data 34 (27 unique For the training and testing of the models, we also required some background TCRs that we do not expect to recognize the epitopes in our data sets.

Both of the data sets we use determine the subjects from whom the TCRs in the data have been obtained from. We therefore chose to use leave-one-subject-out (LOSO) cross-validation, where we leave out all TCRs from one subject, train the model with all the other TCRs, test it with the TCRs left out, and repeat this for all subjects. The epitope-specific TCRs are always complemented with an equal number of background TCRs in both training and test sets, except for the experiments presented in Section Discriminating between epitope-specific TCRs, were we use only the VDJdb data. We thought this would be the most realistic procedure for the evaluation, as this is likely how these kinds of models will be applied to new data: A model is trained with some set of TCRs and then predictions would be made for TCRs sequenced from an individual from who we have not seen any TCR sequences beforehand. We have chosen to create separate models for each epitope, as this approach automatically handles potential cross-reactivity between different epitopes-we only have to select such TCRs for training the model that we can assume to recognize that one epitope or to not recognize that epitope. If we then want to predict TCR's specificity to one or several epitopes, we can apply one or several models and get separate predictions for each of the epitopes.",

We utilized GPflow's variational GP model (VGP) and scalable variational GP model (SVGP) [31, 32] . Multiple kernel learning. When a TCR binds to a pMHC, its CDR3s and CDR1s from both \u03b1-and \u03b2-chains are in direct contact with the peptide most of the time. CDR2s and CDR2.5s can contact the peptide, but they usually only interact with the MHC, see Glanville et al. [9] for an overview of contacts between different CDRs and peptides. Dash et al. [10] took this into account by giving fixed weights for the distances between amino acids within different CDRs, giving more weight to the CDR3. As it varies which CDRs can be in contact with different peptides, we did not want to determine the importance of these different CDRs beforehand, but instead created separate kernels for each CDR and let our model decide which of them are important.

[38] published a dataset (the Zheng data) of single-cell RNA and TCR\u03b1\u03b2 of T cells from HBsAg-positive HCC-patients from blood, nonmalignant liver tissue and tumour tissue. The unnormalized expression count data of T cells passing the quality control were fetched from GEO (GSE98638) along with the TCR\u03b1\u03b2sequences inferred from the full-transcript single-cell RNA-sequencing data and inferred phenotypic states as described by Zheng et al. As the TCR\u03b2-sequenced training data for HBVspecific epitopes was HLA-A restricted, we focused our analysis only on T cells capable of peptide recognition in HLA-A restricted manner, namely clusters CD8-LEF1, CD8-CX3CR1, CD8-LAYN and CD8-GZMK. The data was log-normalized to 10 000 counts per cell and scaled accordingly with the Seurat 3.0.2. [65] package for R 3.5.2.",

The highly variable genes (HVGs) were chosen to be the genes showing the highest mean to variance ratio (min expression = 0.5, max expression 3, min variance 0.5) with the FindVariableFeatures-function. The linear dimensionality reduction was calculated with PCA for the scaled expression matrix containing only HVGs. Non-linear dimensionality reduction was performed with UMAP for principal components that had standard deviation >2 using the standard parameters with the RunUMAP-function. To receive a better grouping for the selected cells, we used a graph-based clustering approach implemented in the Seurat tool. To find the shared nearest neighbor graph, the function FindNeighbors was used with the Table 4 . HBV-epitopes for which TCRGP classifiers were trained. The numbers of epitope-specific TCRs and subjects, and mean AUROC scores from leave-one-subject-out cross-validations are shown. The optimal clustering was decided by agreement of grouping in the UMAP-embedding and the labels from clustering by visual interpretation. The cytotoxic and exhaustion signatures for the clusters were calculated as cell-wise mean expression of cytotoxic (NKG7, CCL4, CST7, PRF1, GZMA, GZMB, IFNG, CCL3) and exhaustion genes (CTLA4, PDCD1, HAVCR2, TIGIT, LAG3) . The difference between the signatures was assessed with Mann-Whitney U test for individual cells in clusters. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) between the clusters was performed on genes that were detected at least in 0.1% of the cells and had at least log fold-change of 0.01 between the tested cells. The gene list was ordered based on the fold-change. Overlap with HALLMARK-category was assessed and the False Discovery Rate (FDR) calculated while the number of permutations was 1000.",
