            "text": "acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was announced, also known as COVID-19 [2] . On March 2, 2020, the first Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID- 19) case was confirmed in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) [3] . Soon after, the Saudi Ministry of Health (MOH) initiated campaigns to increase the public awareness about the routes of COVID-19 transmission and prevention methods. This was followed by strict measures such as curfew or lockdown to control transmission at the national level. KSA has 13 administrative regions, some of which applied 24-h lockdown, while others applied partial lockdown based on the number of active/ critical/death cases and the burden on the healthcare system. In addition, places with high risk of transmission such as shopping malls, restaurants, coffee shops and barbershops were closed until June 20, 2020. During this period, telemedicine was activated through the universal MOH hotline (937). In the same period, dental clinics were advised to close except for dental emergencies per the MOH recommendations [4] . This recommendation was aligned with that of the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the American Dental Association (ADA) [5] and other international dental organizations [6] . Furthermore, postponing nonurgent dental procedures was recommended, and dental patients were advised to contact their dental practices via teleconsultation in order to triage cases based on urgency and plan management accordingly [7, 8] .",

Moreover, most dental procedures are aerosol-producing, especially those using the dental hand piece [10] . This poses a risk of spreading infection in the dental office during the pandemic [11, 12] . It has been documented that the virus in the aerosol can stay viable for more than 3 h with high surface stability exceeding 72 h [13] . It was evident that aerosol-generating procedures were avoided for urgent dental care during the first six weeks of the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK, as they accounted for only 0.8% of all procedures. Three-fourth of patients undergoing triage needed clinical consultation with the most common reasons for urgent dental care being symptomatic irreversible pulpitis and symptomatic apical periodontitis, followed by acute dental abscess. The most common treatment provided was extraction (63%), followed by antibiotic prescription (13%) [14] . Another study found that the incidence of trauma cases in emergency departments during COVID-19 decreased with the majority being described as minor soft tissue trauma [15] . A Chinese study observed a 38% decrease in dental emergency patients and a 13% decrease in non-urgencies after the announcement of the COVID-19 pandemic. Also the types of conditions for which urgent dental treatment is sought has changed, as the proportion of orofacial infections increased by 20.9%, while dental trauma conditions decreased by 3.7% [16] .",

Another study assessed dental patients' apprehension during the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) outbreak in 2014 in Riyadh, KSA. It was reported that 26% of participants expressed apprehension about undergoing dental care due to fear of contracting the infection [18] . A recent study reported that about 84% of pediatric dental patients' parents from China would not take their child for dental care, even in the urgent case of severe toothache. Moreover, 92% of parents believed that a dental clinic is a place with high risk of virus transmission [19] .",

Another study reported the dominance of seeking help from outside of health facilities during outbreaks, which highlights the importance of public health education [21] . During the latest COVID-19 pandemic in China, the majority of patients with acute respiratory infections refrained from seeking medical assistance [22] . This reflects that further understanding of the health-seeking behavior for dental care during the COVID-19 pandemic is needed. The objective of this study was to examine the social determinants associated with the decision to seek dental care in Saudi Arabia during the COVID-19 pandemic.",

The Research Ethics Committee at the Faculty of Dentistry, King Abdulaziz University (#035-04-20) approved the study. A non-probability snowball sampling technique was used to recruit participants. Inclusion criteria for participants were that they live in KSA and be age of 18 years or older. Workers in the dental field were excluded. A web-based, self-administered, anonymous survey using the QuestionPro platform was used to collect responses electronically during the COVID-19 lockdown period. An electronic letter of invitation was embedded in the survey link. Once a person received the survey and clicked on the survey link, the QuestionPro platform counts this person as a recipient of the survey. Recruitment was solicited through the social media platforms commonly used in Saudi Arabia including WhatsApp, Twitter, Instagram, and Snapchat. The survey was distributed on twitter, Instagram, and Snapchat using regional news accounts, while distribution through WhatsApp used snowball sampling.

The second section asked about the details of the participant's last dental visit (when, where, and why). The third section included a list of emergency and urgent dental situations that may require dental care during COVID-19 pandemic. This list was obtained from the ADA list of dental emergencies during the COVID-19 pandemic [23] and Ministry of Health (MOH) guidelines [4] . Both lists were similar except that the MOH guidelines had four additional urgent dental situations: an ulcer persisting for more than 3 weeks, dentin sensitivity, temporomandibular joint (TMJ) arthralgia and/or myalgia, and broken bonded retainers. The ADA makes a distinction between emergency and urgent dental conditions by defining dental emergencies as \"potentially life-threatening and require immediate treatment including uncontrolled bleeding, cellulitis potentially compromising the patient's airway, and facial bones trauma potentially compromising the patient's airway\" and defining urgent dental conditions as \"conditions that requires immediate attention to relieve severe pain and/ or risk of infection\" [23]. Participants were asked \"What would you do if you had such a dental condition now?\" The responses to emergency and urgent dental situations were grouped into three categories: The first category was choosing to go to the dental clinic, the second category was using teleconsultation and subsequently going to the dental clinic if advised to do so, and the third category was choosing not to go, even if advised to do so. Photographic images were included for the cellulitis and localized abscess questions to illustrate the situation to lay people. The fourth section included a list of routine non-urgent dental care procedures. Lastly, the participants were asked to identify the severity of pain that would make them seek dental treatment during the pandemic using the Numeric Rating Scale (NRS-11) in which 0 represents no pain and 10 represents the worst pain possible [24] . Informed consent was obtained from participants who agreed to contribute to this study. Content validity of the survey was ensured by aligning it with the ADA list of dental emergencies [23] . This was further assessed through a panel of dental specialists and general dentists. Furthermore, face validity was checked with 20 laypeople that are not from a health-related discipline. Pilot testing was performed for both language versions before instigation of the recruitment, and further adjustments were made accordingly.",

We found that social disparities do exist in emergency dental care seeking decision-making in Saudi Arabia during this pandemic. The participants had some fear regarding risks involved with going to a dental clinic during the pandemic, and therefore a large proportion opted not to go to the dental clinic in many urgent dental situations, but rather preferred teleconsultations and managing the situation at home. There was a small proportion of participants who did not mind going to the dental clinic for routine, non-urgent procedures during the pandemic. When examining the participants' opinion regarding seeking dental care for dental emergencies during the COVID-19 pandemic, we found that the proportion of people willing to go to the dental clinic varied between 94.4% for trauma of facial bones compromising the airway to 65.8% for cellulitis potentially compromising the airway. It was surprising that only 65.8% were willing to go for dental care in the case of cellulitis, despite showing a photograph of a severe cellulitis condition and Model P value P < 0.001 P < 0.001 P < 0.001 mentioning that it was compromising the airway. This may indicate the need to educate the public about lifethreatening dental conditions that necessitate emergency dental care. For urgent dental care conditions, the proportion of those who are willing to go the dental clinic ranged from 55.3% to 81.2%. One possible explanation is that people were highly concerned about virus transmission and therefore preferred to manage the dental situation in a way that avoided going to the dental clinic. One interesting finding was that 12.4% to 24.2% were still willing to go for routine non-urgent dental procedures during the lockdown, despite the recommendation to postpone such procedures at that time. Insufficient knowledge among the public about COVID-19 was observed in a recent study in Riyadh, KSA. It showed that only 58% of the public had good knowledge about COVID-19 facts with 81% reporting adequate practice during this pandemic [25] .",

It was interesting to note that female participants were more likely to choose not to seek dental care for emergency dental conditions during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our finding is supported by Berglund et al. who found that women, those with lower education level, renters (compared to those owning a private house), and those with financial problems were associated with increased risk of refraining from seeking dental care [32] . In the contrary, Thompson et al. reported that females tend to seek heath care more than males [33] . In this pandemic, media coverage could be a contributing factor influencing an individual's health-seeking behaviour as the media is heavily involved through many channels [34] . Garfin et al. found that repeated media exposure could lead to increased anxiety and misplaced health-seeking behaviors [35] . Moreover, perceived risk also does affect health-seeking behavior according to Gonzalez-Olmo et al., who reported that those who perceived the dental clinic as a high-risk location for acquiring COVID-19, reported avoiding dental services [36] . In another study, 97% of patients reported the risk of infection during a dental visit as moderate or high, with 80% reporting that the main factor affecting their dental visit decision was being afraid of the potential of transmission in the hospital setting [37] . In our study, the mean pain score that participants chose as the threshold to go to dental clinic during the pandemic was 7.2 \u00b1 2.2. This is in agreement with a Norwegian study that reported a mean pain score of 7.0 \u00b1 2.6 that would make patients seek dental emergency treatment [38] .

Another limitation is the fact that our study sample may not be a true representative of KSA population as participants had to be literate and active on social media. According to the most recent data, 84.9% of the Saudi population are literate [42] and 58% (equivalent to 18.3 Million) of them are active on social media [45] . Social desirability bias is also a possible limitation; however, it has been found to be of less concern in web-based surveys than in telephone or in-person surveys [46, 47] . Non-response bias is another potential limitation, yet since sociodemographic characteristics of the study sample are not different from national figures it is not a major concern. This study presents new insight regarding the social determinants of health-seeking decisions for seeking emergency, urgent, and routine dental care during the COVID-19 pandemic.",

It was alarming that some people were afraid to seek dental care for life-threatening dental emergencies as cellulitis during this pandemic. On the other hand, some people were willing to go for nonurgent and cosmetic reasons. This reflects the importance of increasing public health awareness and governmental regulations especially during pandemics. In addition, preference for using teleconsultations did leap during this pandemic. It would be interesting to explore actual dental care utilization during the COVID-19 pandemic in Saudi Arabia in future research.",
