Treatment of a PED often begins with lubrication using preservative-free artificial tears, bandage soft contact lenses, pressure patching, debridement of the edges of the defect, scleral lenses, and/or tarsorrhaphy. [4] [5] [6] [7] Autologous serum eye drops and other blood-derived products [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] have been used with some success, but varying concentrations of serum (from 20-100%) have been used with there being no standard dilution and rarely an attempt to identify and quantify any cytokines, including growth factors in the serum that promotes epithelial healing. The novel secretome called ST266 (formerly known as amnion-derived cellular cytokine solution [ACCS]) was developed and produced under good manufacturing practice (GMP) conditions by Noveome Biotherapeutics, Inc. using a proprietary population of cells known as amnion-derived multipotent progenitor (AMP) cells. The AMP cells are cultured using a serum free minimal media in bioreactors and the conditioned culture media is collected over several weeks. The culture media is then further processed through filtration steps to remove certain cellular components and other debris before storage of the bulk drug product.",

Only lots that fall within the strict specifications of these rigorous tests are used for preclinical and clinical studies. The final drug product is not concentrated and is devoid of extracellular vesicles. ST266 contains analytes at nanogram and picogram concentrations similar to levels that naturally occur in the body. 13 Efforts to isolate individual analytes that correlate to efficacy in preclinical animal models are underway. However, in contrast to the conventional one analyte/one activity model for drug efficacy, evidence suggests that multiple analytes working synergistically likely account for the positive biological effects demonstrated in multiple preclinical studies. 14 The presence of a subset of cytokines and growth factors present in ST266 and known in the literature to effect corneal cells can be found in Table 1 . [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] In preclinical models, ST266 applied topically has been shown to have a positive impact on epithelial healing of the skin and the cornea. ST266 improved dermal epithelial healing in meshed human partial thickness xenografts in athymic \"nude\" rats. 28 Further, in a partial thickness scald burn model in guinea pigs, ST266-treated animals had a significant increase in epithelialization compared to controls. Histology showed excellent regeneration of the epidermis with rete ridge formation. 29 In addition, in a model of dermal healing in swine given streptozotocin to induce diabetes, healing was accelerated with a significantly thicker epidermis and more cell layers and rete ridges in the ST266 treated wounds, compared with saline controls. 30 Moreover, in a rabbit model of corneal healing, ST266 treatment facilitated corneal re-epithelialization and was shown to be antiinflammatory. 31 Additionally, ST266 has been shown to be neuroprotective, [32] [33] [34] improves impaired wound healing, 35, 36 and is anti-inflammatory. 32, [35] [36] [37] To date, phase I and II clinical trials have demonstrated ST266 to be safe and well tolerated in individuals with dry eye disease 38 and allergic conjunctivitis. 39 Because it is composed of multiple cytokines and growth factors, ST266 represents a potential novel biologic for treatment of PEDs. To determine whether there may be improved epithelial healing in the human cornea, similar to what was observed in rodent skin, diabetic porcine skin, and rabbit corneas, an exploratory phase II open label clinical study of ST266 for the treatment of PED was conducted.",

            "text": "PEDs can be challenging to manage. Despite a better understanding of the different etiologies of PEDs and the wide range of therapeutic modalities available, some PEDs remain refractory to treatment. Aside from conventional treatments, such as patching, bandage soft contact lenses, preservative-free lubrication, and debridement of the edges of the PED, many experimental treatments have been investigated, including insulin, 41 substance P, 42 connexin, 43 thymosin, 44 matrix regenerating agents, 45 and adipose mesenchymal stem cells, 46 all with varying results. Biologics, such as autologous serum eye drops and other blood-derived products, including platelets rich in growth factors, have become popular for treating PEDs, as these products contain various cytokines and growth factors, such as EGF, TGF-\u03b21, PDGF, and FGF, that are known to promote corneal epithelial wound healing. 11, 12 Autologous serum is a prepa-ration taken from the patient in a hospital laboratory that is sometimes diluted and used directly as eye drops in a multidose vial. Use of autologous serum and platelets does not require approval by the US Food and Drug Administration, but its role may be reduced by a lack of insurance coverage. 47 Recombinant human nerve growth factor (cenergermin 0.002%, Oxervate; Dompe, Milan, Italy) is a newer treatment for neurotrophic keratitis (NK), and has been shown to be effective for decreasing the size of PEDs in stage II NK. 48, 49 Although this treatment has been found to be effective in several trials, the drug is expensive, and its cost-effectiveness has been questioned. 50 Amniotic membrane has been used for treating the ocular surface for over 80 years, and it was popularized in the 1990s for its wound healing and antiinflammatory properties. 51 Commercially, amniotic membranes are available in dehydrated and cryopreserved forms for placement on the ocular surface, which may be uncomfortable for the patient. ST266 is a unique solution made by proprietary culturing of a selected population of amnion epithelial cells under current good manufacturing practice (cGMP) and collecting their secretions. It contains multiple cytokines and growth factors that act through multiple pathways, such as effects of oxidative stress reduction via SIRT1-mediated mitochondrial function promotion, and pAKT-mediated cell survival signaling. 37 In the current exploratory phase II multicenter open-label study, PEDs arising from multiple etiologies were enrolled, some previously treated with a varying array of therapies. Eight subjects had previously been treated with amniotic membrane 51 (PROKERA or PROKERA Slim; BioTissue, Miami, FL, USA) and/or bandage soft contact lens, and four were treated with autologous serum. The etiologies of the PEDs included neurotrophic keratopathy, prior infectious corneal ulcer, and herpes zoster ophthalmicus. Because PEDs may arise from many different causes, ST266, with its complex mixture of wound healing factors that include anti-inflammatory molecules, may address these multiple underlaying etiologies.",

            "text": "Five eyes had complete PED closure during the 28 days of treatment. One of the 5 reopened on day 24 and then closed by day 35 during the post-treatment follow-up period. All eyes demonstrated a decrease in the size of the PED compared with baseline. Of note, in 12 of 12 subjects, the corneal wound was reduced in the area over 28 days. All 12 subjects received topical antibiotics at some time during treatment with ST266. ST266 has been shown in a preclinical rat study to improve healing despite bacterial contamination in the wounds. 36 This may explain, in part, why all PEDs decreased in size over 4 weeks of treatment. At the 1week post-treatment evaluation visit (day 35) during which no ST266 was given, healing appeared to be sustained after treatment was discontinued. Importantly, in all but one of 11 eyes at 1-week post-treatment (day 35), the defect was smaller in size than at day 28. One subject had a longstanding PED, which was present for 393 days prior to enrollment in the study. In this eye, ST266 treatment led to a smaller PED size by day 28 (30% smaller compared with baseline) but was 12% larger than baseline 1 week after treatment ended. This is likely related to the underlying condition that initially resulted in the longstanding PED and suggests that a longer treatment period is necessary for complete healing. Indeed, it has been shown that the longer a PED has been open, the longer it takes to heal. 9 The data from this study suggest that a general reduction in the average PED size is present, but there are considerable fluctuations in measurements for some eyes. The descriptive pattern of PED size across time may indicate a varied response to ST266 treatment. For example, observation of PED area size versus time in patients 2, 4, 7, 9, 10, and 11 showed a strong linear trend suggesting a constant rate of re-epithelization in response to treatment (see Fig. 3B ). Notably, these six patients with linear-like re-epithelization rates were non-diabetic, whereas the other five patients were diabetic and showed a nonlinear re-epithelization response to ST266 treatment. Further study with a larger number of eyes will be needed to evaluate this observation.",
