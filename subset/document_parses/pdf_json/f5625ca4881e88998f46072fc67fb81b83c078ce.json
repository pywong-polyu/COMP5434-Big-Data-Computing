The combination of circumstances being difficult for strong impact evaluation, the importance of the topic and concerns over the publication environment may lead to the proliferation of low strength studies. High-quality causal evidence requires a combination of rigorous methods, clear reporting, appropriate caveats and the appropriate circumstances for the methods used. [3] [4] [5] [6] Rigorous evidence is difficult in the best of circumstances, and the circumstances for evaluating non-pharmaceutical intervention (NPI) policy effects on COVID-19 are particularly challenging. 5 The global pandemic has yielded a combination of a large number of concurrent policy and non-policy changes, complex infectious disease dynamics, and unclear timing between policy implementation and impact; all of this makes isolating the causal impact of any particular policy or policies exceedingly difficult. 7 The scientific literature on COVID-19 is exceptionally large and fast growing. Scientists published more than 100 000 papers related to COVID-19 in 2020. 8 There is some general concern that the volume and speed 9 10 at which this work has been produced may result in a literature that is overall low quality and unreliable. [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] Given the importance of the topic, it is critical that decision-makers are able to understand what is known and knowable 5 16 from observational data in COVID-19 policy, as well as what is unknown and/or unknowable.",

First, this is a systematic review of methodological strength of evidence for a given literature as opposed to a review summary of the evidence of a particular topic. As such, we do not summarise and attempt to combine the results for any of the literature. Second, rather than being a comprehensive review of every possible aspect of what might be considered 'quality,' this is a review of targeted critical design features for actionable inference for COVID-19 policy impact evaluation and methods. It is designed to be a set of broad criteria for minimal plausibility of actionable causal inference, where each of the criteria is necessary but not sufficient for strong design. Issues in other domains (data, details of the design, statistics, etc) further reduce overall actionability and quality, and thorough review in those domains is needed for any studies passing our basic minimal criteria. Third, because the scope relies on guided, but difficult and subjective assessments of methodological appropriateness, we use a discussion-based consensus process to arrive at consistent and replicable results, rather than a more common model with two independent reviewers with conflict resolution. The independent review serves primarily as a starting point for discussion, but is neither designed nor expected to be a strong indicator of the overall consensus ratings of the group.",

The specific study designs triggered subquestions and/or slightly altered the language of the questions being asked, but all three of the methods design categories shared these four key questions: \u25ba Graphical presentation: 'Does the analysis provide graphical representation of the outcome over time?' -Graphical presentation refers to how the authors present the data underlying their impact evaluation method. This is a critical criteria for assessing the potential validity of the assumed model. The key questions here are whether any chart shows the outcome over time and the assumed models of the counterfactuals. To meet a high degree of confidence in this category, graphical displays must show the outcome and connect to the counterfactual construction method. \u25ba Functional form: 'Is the functional form of the model used for the trend in counterfactual infectious disease outcomes (eg, linear, non-parametric, exponential, logarithmic, etc) well-justified and appropriate?' -Functional form refers to the statistical functional form of the trend in counterfactual infectious disease outcomes (ie, the assumptions used to construct counterfactual outcomes). This may be a linear function, non-parametric, exponential or logarithmic function, infectious disease model projection or any other functional form. The key criteria here are whether this is discussed and justified in the manuscript, and if so, is it a plausibly appropriate choice given infectious disease outcomes. \u25ba Timing of policy impact: 'Is the date or time threshold set to the appropriate date or time (eg, is there lag between the intervention and outcome)?' -Timing of policy impact refers to assumptions about when we would expect to see an impact from the policy vis-a-vis the timing of the policy introduction. This would typically be modelled with leads and lags. The impact of policy can occur before enactment (eg, in cases where behavioural change after policy is announced, but before it takes place in anticipation) or long after the policy is enacted (eg, in cases where it takes time to ramp up policy implementation or impacts). The key criteria here are whether this is discussed and justified in the manuscript, and if so, whether it is a plausibly appropriate choice given the policy and outcome. \u25ba Concurrent changes: 'Is this policy the only uncontrolled or unadjusted-for way in which the outcome could have changed during the measurement period (differently for policy and non-policy regions)?' -Concurrent changes refers to the presence of uncontrolled other events and changes that may influence outcomes at the same time as the policy would impact outcomes. In order to assess the impact of one policy or set of policies, the impact of all other forces that differentially impact the outcome must either be negligible or controlled for. The key criteria here are whether it is likely that there are substantial other uncontrolled forces (eg, policies, behavioural changes) which may be differentially impacting outcomes at the same time as the policy of interest. For each of the four key questions, reviewers were given the option to select 'No,' 'Mostly no,' 'Mostly yes,' and 'Yes' with justification text requested for all answers other than 'Yes.' Each question had additional prompts as guidance, and with much more detail provided in the full guidance document. Ratings are, by design, subjective assessments of the category according to the guidance. We do not use numerical scoring, for similar reasons as Cochrane suggests that the algorithms for summary judgements for the RoB2 tool are merely 'proposed' assessments, which reviewers should change as they believe appropriate. 22 It is entirely plausible, for example, for a study to meet all but one criteria but for the one remaining to be sufficiently violated that the entire Open access collective category is compromised. Alternatively, there could be many minor violations of all of the criteria, but that they were collectively not sufficiently problematic to impact overall ratings. Further, reviewers were also tasked with considering room for doubt in cases where answers to these questions were unclear.",

Thorough review of data quality, statistical validity, and other issues are also critical points of potential weakness in study designs, and would be needed in addition to these criteria, if these key design criteria are met. A thorough justification and explanation of how and why these questions were selected is available in the provided guidance document and in Haber et al. 17 Finally, reviewers were asked a summary question: \u25ba Overall: 'Do you believe that the design is appropriate for identifying the policy impact(s) of interest?' Reviewers were asked to consider the scale of this question to be both independent/not relative to any other papers, and that any one substantial issue with the study design could render it a 'No' or 'Mostly no.' Reviewers were asked to follow the guidance and their previous answers, allowing for their own weighting of how important each issue was to the final result. A study could be excellent on all dimensions except for one, and that one dimension could render it inappropriate for causal inference. As such, in addition to the overall rating question, we also generated a 'weakest link' metric for overall assessment, representing the lowest rating among the four key questions (graphical representation, functional form, timing of policy impact and concurrent changes). A 'mostly yes' or 'yes' is considered a passing rating, indicating that the study was not found to be inappropriate on the specific dimension of interest.",

Identifying the effects of many of these policies, particularly for the spring of 2020, is likely to be unknown and perhaps unknowable. However, there remains additional opportunities with more favourable circumstances, such as measuring overall impact of NPIs as bundles, rather than individual policies. Similarly, studies estimating the impact of reopening policies or policy cancellation are likely to have fewer concurrent changes to address.",

With the exception of the graphical assessment, proper assessment of the core methodological issues requires that reviewers are able to weigh the evidence as they see fit. Much like standard institutional peer review, reviewers independently had highly heterogeneous opinions, attributable to differences in opinion or training, misunderstandings/learning about the review tool and process, and expected reliance on the consensus process. Unlike traditional peer review, there was subject-matter-specific guidance and a process to consolidate and discuss those heterogeneous initial opinions. The reduction in ratings from the initial highly heterogeneous ratings to a lower heterogeneity in ratings indicates that reviewers had initially identified issues differently, but that the discussion and consensus process helped elucidate the extent of the different issues that each reviewer detected and brought to discussion. This also reflects reviewer learning over time, where reviewers were better able to identify issues at the consensus phase than earlier.",

One large literature from which there may be COVID-19 policy evaluation otherwise meeting our inclusion criteria are preprints. Many preprints would likely fare well in our review process. Higher strength papers often require more time for review and publication, and many highquality papers may be in the publication pipeline now. Second, this review excluded studies that had a quantitative impact evaluation as a secondary part of the study (eg, to estimate parameters for microsimulation or disease modelling). Third, the review does not include policy inference studies that do not measure the impact of a specific policy. For instance, there are studies that estimate the impact of reduced mobility on COVID-19 outcomes but do not attribute the reduced mobility to any specific policy change. A considerable number of studies that present analyses of COVID-19 outcomes to inform policy are excluded because they do not present a quantitative estimate of specific policies' treatment effects. Importantly, this study was designed to assess a minimal set of criteria critical to the design of impact evaluation studies of COVID-19 policies. Studies found meeting these criteria would require further and more comprehensive review for assessing overall quality and actionability. Unfortunately, exceedingly few studies we reviewed, taken largely from the high-profile literature, were found to meet these minimal criteria.",
