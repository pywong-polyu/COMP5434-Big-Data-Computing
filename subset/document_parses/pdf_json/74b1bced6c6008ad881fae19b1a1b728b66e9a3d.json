            "text": "Comorbidities in COVID-19 patients often worsen clinical conditions and may represent death predictors. Here, the expression of 5 genes, known to encode coronavirus receptors/interactors (ACE2, TMPRSS2, CLEC4M, DPP4 and TMPRSS11D), was investigated in normal and cancer tissues, and their molecular relationships with clinical comorbidities were investigated. Using expression data from GENT2 databases, we evaluated gene expression in all anatomical districts from 32 normal tissues in 3,902 individuals. Functional relationships with body districts were analyzed by Chilibot. We performed DisGeNet, GeneMania and DAVID analyses to identify human diseases associated with these genes. Transcriptomic-expression levels were then analyzed in 31 cancer-types and healthy controls from about 43,000 individuals, using GEPIA2 and GENT2 databases. By performing ROC analysis, Area Under Curve (AUC) was used to discriminate healthy from cancer patients. Coronavirus receptors were found to be expressed in several body districts. Moreover, the 5 genes were found to associate with acute respiratory syndrome, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases and cancer, i.e., the most frequent COVID-19 comorbidities. Their expression levels were found to be significantly altered in cancer types including colon, kidney, liver, testis, thyroid and skin cancers, (p < 0.0001); AUC > 0.80 suggests TMPRSS2, CLEC4M and DPP4 as relevant markers of kidney, liver, and thyroid cancer, respectively. The five coronavirus receptors are related to all main COVID-19 comorbidities and three show significantly different expression in cancer vs control tissues. Further investigation into their role may help in monitoring other comorbidities as well as for follow-up of patients who have recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection.",

            "text": "COVID-19 pandemic is now affecting almost all countries. Patients in severe clinical conditions are often affected by other pathologies, the most frequent being diabetes, coronary heart diseases, cerebrovascular diseases [1] , cancer [2] . SARS-CoV-2 virus directly affects mainly lung tissues and higher respiratory tract. Nevertheless, besides the lung and lung fluids, SARS-CoV-2 has been found also in far districts such as in feces (about 30% of cases) and in the blood (1% of cases) [3] . Further, acute kidney injury, proteinuria and hematuria have been found associated with death of COVID-19 patients [4] and other organs such as intestine, testis and kidney have been proposed as possible transmission routes [5] . Previous studies demonstrated large diffusion of other coronavirus strains (i.e., SARS-CoV) in almost the entire body [6] . In the present study we focused on the molecular bases possibly underlying the comorbidities observed in SARS-CoV-2 infection. We investigated genes involved as receptors or main interactors of SARS-CoV-2 and similar coronaviruses responsible of SARS and MERS. Namely ACE2, TMPRSS2, CLEC4M, DPP4 and TMPRSS11D were analyzed, by assessing their RNA expression levels in different body districts and in different cancer types. ACE2 (Angiotensin converting enzyme 2) is a carboxypeptidase which converts angiotensin I to angiotensin 1-9 and angiotensin II to angiotensin 1-7. It is recognized as the receptor of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 viruses [7] . TMPRSS2 (Transmembrane protease serine 2) is a serine protease up-regulated by androgen hormones; it is involved in the infection process of many viruses, including coronaviruses, acting on the spike proteins and on ACE2, facilitating virus-cell membrane fusion [8, 9] . CLEC4M, DPP4 and TNPRSS11D are reported to be receptors or interactors of other coronaviruses; while their receptor-activity for SARS-CoV-2 is not shown to date, many evidences demonstrate their role in related coronaviruses. CLEC4M (C-type lectin domain family 4 member M) is a membrane protein involved as an attachment site of many viruses, including SARS; it is a receptor with pathogen recognition capability toward several parasites and viruses, and with cell adhesion properties. It is a known attachment receptor for Ebola virus, Hepatitis C virus, Human coronavirus 229E, SARS coronavirus and others. [10] . DDP4 (Dipeptidyl peptidase 4) is a serine exopeptidase, corresponding to the T-cell activation antigen CD26. It is a glycoprotein membrane receptor involved in T-cell activation, with peptidase enzymatic activity. It is known as the MERS receptor [11] . TMPRSS11D (Transmembrane protease serine 11D) is a serine protease, active on ACE2 as well as on viral spike proteins. It cleaves and activates the spike glycoprotein of human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E) facilitating its cell entrance [12] [13] ",

Namely, ACE2, TMPRSS2, CLEC4M, DPP4 and TMPRSS11D expression levels in normal tissues were derived from GENT2 database, containing data from about 28,000 controls and cancer subjects (see Supplementary   Table 1 for further details on tissues and numerosity). Interestingly, the 5 coronaviruses receptors were found to be expressed in almost any anatomical district. Expression in normal tissues was analyzed in more details as compared to differential expression in cancer types; as reported below. Ubiquitous expression was confirmed by an additional analysis carried out on Human Protein Atlas, showing both protein and RNA expression in all body districts (Supplementary Figure 1) . The almost ubiquitous expression of coronavirus receptors led us to hypothesize that their biological action may affect many organs and tissues. To investigate this hypothesis a Chilibot analysis was carried out (www.chilibot.org). The presence of interactive relationships was analyzed by measuring co-occurrence of the given keywords in the same sentence within the manuscripts abstract. Table 1 shows that most anatomical districts share interactive relationships with \"coronavirus\" word. Districts such as colon, liver, testis, lung, kidney show the highest relationships with coronavirus, reported in Table 1 , and also show the highest RNA expression levels in many cases (see Supplementary Figure 1 ). carcinogenesis and metastasis were found to be associated to these genes. Infections other than coronavirus were found to be associated to these genes, namely influenza, HIV, HCV, trypanosomiasis infections.",

Given the strong relationships found with different cancer types, we then focused our analysis on the expression level of these genes in a large number of different cancer types, by analyzing transcriptomic datasets. Table 3 shows the presence of significant differential expression in cancer vs normal ctrls in several cases. Namely, ACE2 has validated significant differential expression in colon-, kidney-, testicular-and thyroid-cancers, TMPRSS2 has validated significant differential expression in breast-, colon-head&neck-, kidney-, lung-, skin-and uterus cancers; CLEC4M has validated significant differential expression in liver-, lung-and ovary cancers; DPP4 has validated significant differential expression in breast-, kidney-, blood-, skin-, stomach-and thyroid cancers; TNPRSS11D has validated significant different expression in lung cancer. Figure 2 shows the most relevant differential expression and the corresponding AUC according to ROC analysis, respectively, of TMPRSS2 ( Figure 2A ), CLEC4M ( Figure 2B ) and DPP4 ( Figure 2C ). The AUC > 0.80 shown by TMPRSS2, CLEC4M and DPP4 suggests that these genes may act as effective molecular markers for kidney, liver and thyroid cancers, respectively. Combining information taken from the expression levels in the normal tissues and from Table 3 (i.e. cancer types with a validated differential expression vs the corresponding normal tissues), led to an interesting observation summarized in Figure 3 : the normal tissues where such genes have the highest expression levels match with cancer types where these genes show a validated differential expression (red columns in Figure 3 ).

According to the high expression values of ACE2, TMPRSS2, CLEC4M, DDP4 and TMPRSS11D in the normal skin compartment indicated in Figure 3 , and the large interactive relationships with skin tissue reported in Table 1 , we may hypothesize comorbidity signs in coronavirus patients at the skin level; this has been actually confirmed in a very recent report highlighting dermatological manifestations in about 20% of COVID-19 patients [22] . We focused the current study on cancer comorbidity in COVID-19 patients, recently shown to reach a rate up to 11% [23] . We highlight here the relevant association of TMPRSS2 with prostate cancer. TMPRSS2 is an androgen-regulated gene which helps coronavirus entry into cells. Several studies propose TMPRSS2 as a prostate cancer marker, as fused with ERG gene. We then hypothesize that coronavirus infection, related at least in part to TMPRSS2 expression, might be associated to prostate cancer risk, at least to some extent. Further, the analyses carried out revealed that different cancer types as well as carcinogenesis and cancer metastasis are associated to such 5 genes; in our opinion this may explain, at least in part, why cancer is reported as one of the main comorbidities in coronavirus infection [28, 2] , namely hematological malignancies, colorectal cancer, lung cancer [29] . We speculate that the frequent cancer co-occurrence in COVID-19 patients may not be a casual or age-related event, rather it may associate to specific expression patterns of SARS-Cov-2 receptors in kidney, prostate, testis, thyroid, skin and other organs.",

More in detail, a significant reduction of TMPRSS2 and CLEC4M in kidney and liver cancers, and a significant increase of DPP4 in thyroid cancer was highlighted. The AUC was >0.81, so relevant to propose these as possible molecular markers to be further investigated diffusion. According to a recent study [30] a significant association of Kawasaki disease with SARS-CoV-2 has been observed. Kawasaki disease has been proposed to be related to coronavirus infection although this is still a debated issue [31] , while a genetic association of Kawasaki disease with ACE gene polymorphism has been proven [32] and a role of ACE2 in vasculitis and the control of endothelial wall physiology is known [33] . In addition, mice transgenic for human ACE2 show vasculitis signs [34] . Furthermore, TMPRSS11D has been indicated as possible target gene of miRnas, biomarkers of Kawasaki disease [35] , further linking SARS-Cov-2 receptors to Kawasaki disease. One additional observation should be highlighted: gender and age are known to play a key role as risk-or protective-factors in the most serious and lethal forms of COVID-19 patients. In fact, COVID-19 epidemiology reveals that men and elderly are largely more seriously affected than women and young/child [36] . Noteworthy, genes under investigation in this study appear to be strongly related to the endocrine axis (disease class named \"REPRODUCTION\" in Figure 2) and to aging (disease class named \"AGING\" in Figure 2 ). Thus, we hypothesize that the functional connections of coronavirus receptors with prostate cancer and the \"AGING\" and \"REPRODUCTION\" disease classes may at least in part underlie the age and sex epidemiological features of COVID-19 patients. As final note, the disease-class that best associates to the molecular network of the 5 coronavirus genes is \"IMMUNE\" (Figure 2 ). It is not surprising that molecules related to the virus-entry associate with this class, but this finding underlies these molecules as potential triggers of both immune-related viral infections and other diseases such as endocrine related and cancer related diseases.",

An additional analysis was carried out on GeneMania tool (www.genemania.org) [41] . Each gene was singularly analyzed to obtain a list of 20 genes most related to it. GeneMania selects the related genes on the basis of protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions, common pathways, reactions, gene and protein expression data, protein domains and phenotypic screening profiles, by using publicly available databases. The 5 lists (each composed by 1 + 20 genes) were analyzed singularly and combined, by means of DAVID Bioinformatics Resources 6.8 (https://david.ncifcrf.gov) [42, 43] , looking for gene-annotation enrichment analysis of gene-diseases association.
