[4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] Preliminary data on waning VE for the mRNA vaccines and opportunity for improved VE for the Janssen vaccine have prompted regulatory approval or emergency use authorization for booster doses in the US for all adults. Nonetheless, there is still limited understanding of the durability of vaccine protection among the general adult population, as well as against novel SARS-CoV-2 variants, including the delta variant (B.1.617.2) and its subtypes. As the immune responses do vary among the vaccines, there remains the potential that the vaccines have distinct durability properties that need to be studied robustly. Studies on the durability of all three US vaccines in the general population have been limited to date, with many focusing on high-risk populations [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] or specific geographic areas. [20] [21] [22] Furthermore, durability of response to initial vaccine regimens remains especially important for management of the pandemic globally, as much of the world remains unvaccinated or only recently vaccinated. As such, it is critical to assess the degree to which protection is sustained to inform on the need and timing for booster doses in the general adult population.",

To evaluate whether vaccineinduced protection wanes over time, we compared the odds of COVID-19 breakthrough infection, hospitalization, or ICU admission in each subsequent 28-day window (months 2 through 6+ since vaccination) relative to the first month since vaccination (reference month lasting 28 days). Here, durability was defined as relatively constant odds for the outcome of interest across time. Month 1 began the day after full vaccination, which was defined as 21-days following the final vaccination dose; day 22 is thus the beginning of the first month of follow-up (Figure 1) . We selected this timeframe to allow for the 14 days required for full vaccination 23 and an additional 7-day washout period to ensure COVID-19-related outcomes included in our study were limited to those due to COVID-19 infections acquired after full vaccination. Since the CDC guidelines recommend waiting 5-7 days after exposure to get tested, 24 test results and hospitalizations recorded soon after full vaccination (i.e., 15-21 days after the last dose) may reflect infections and exposures occurring prior to full vaccination.",

We considered three sets of sensitivity analyses addressing any potential differences in waning of protection due to these factors. We aligned vaccination and follow-up time for the mRNA vaccines to Ad26.COV2.S, requiring the last vaccine dose to be on or after February 27, 2021 for all vaccines, and we also stratified cohorts by age and comorbidity score. Finally, we indirectly translated OR into VE estimates using incidence proportions from larger cohorts of vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals to provide a means of comparing durability of protection across vaccines and outcomes.

The observed waning in VE against hospitalization for BNT162b2 requires further discussion. The apparent decline in VE over time is observed when the study cohort includes subjects vaccinated in January and February 2021. This may be driven, at least in part, by waning immune responses in older and more comorbid patients as observed in other sensitivity analyses. Further investigation is needed to fully understand the complete durability profile of each of the vaccines.",

First, we estimated incidence proportion from large cohorts of vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals where absolute case numbers likely represent underestimates, in part due to the potential for asymptomatic and unconfirmed infections. [5] [6] [7] [8] While this is not an issue if this is equally true for both vaccinated and unvaccinated groups, if providers tested or hospitalized individuals differently based on vaccine status, this may result in bias. Second, many COVID-19-related encounters in the US, including vaccination and tests, occurred in settings where they were not billed to any payer (e.g., mass vaccination clinics) and thus cannot be observed in claims. This can affect the results primarily via misclassification of unvaccinated individuals. This issue would be expected to result in an underestimate of VE. 9,10 Finally, the cohorts differ by timing of events, and relatedly, their demographic makeup. As described above, we attempted to harmonize the baseline odds according to the demographic composition of the unvaccinated cohort. However, demographic differences persist and may limit the comparability of VE across vaccines. All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.",
