Methods: AgNPs were synthesized using the ethnobotanical product gum Arabic. It influenced the nanoparticles with medicinal value through their role as capping, stabilizing, or surface-attached components. The biophysical characteristics of the synthesized AgNPs were studied using UV-vis spectrum, XRD, EDAX, SEM, and TEM tools. The AgNPs were spherical with the average size less than 10 nm. By using the well diffusion and microdilution techniques, the impact of synthesized AgNPs was tested against S. mutans isolates. Results: The smaller the size, the greater the antibacterial and antiviral potential the particles exhibit. The biophysical characteristics of AgNPs the presence of phenols, alcohols, amides, sulfoxide, flavanoids, terpenoids and steroids. The AgNPs exhibited a good antibacterial action against the oral pathogen S. mutans. The synthesized NPs at a dose level of 200 g/mL exhibited an inhibition zone with 18.30 \u00b1 0.5 nm diameter. The synthesised nanoparticles inhibited the genes responsible for biofilm formation of S. mutans over host tooth and gums (gtfB, gtfc, gtfD) and virulent protective factors (comDE, brpA and smu 360) and survival promoter genes (gyrA and spaP, gbpB). Conclusion: The potent antibiotic action over S. mutans seen with the synthesized NPs, paves the way for the development of novel dental care products. Also, the small-sized NPs promote its applicability in COVID-19 pandemic containment.",

In the current approach, a novel method of using tree exudates with a high amount of polysaccharides in gum Arabic [GA] derived from the tree, Acacia senegal (L) Wild, was used to synthesize AgNPs. This resin is a polymer with glycoproteins and polysaccharides. Arabinose and galactose present in the gum give a good binding capacity and are used in the food industry [15] . This water-soluble, edible glue is used in food, pharmaceutical, and industrial applications. Why the gum Arabic is used as a moderating agent to prepare AgNPs is because GA exerts its components over NPs as capping agents change Zeta potential to negative and causes aggregation process [16] . Using GA as a growth medium for nickel nanoparticle preparation enhances excellent antibacterial behaviour [17] . Further GA exuded from A. senegal was proved to be an immunomodulatory agent in COVID-19 patients [18] . Using the natural polymers of GA as a stabilizer promoted capping in nanoparticles and enhanced the compatibility of AgNPs for pharmaceutical and biomedical applications [19] . As the natural polymers in the GA can tune up the synthesis nanoparticles with biomedical potential, in the present study it is planned to synthesize AgNPs using GA. In the present study, the synthesized AgNPs are tested against S. mutans that cause biofilm and induce dental caries. Dental caries is a significant problem among the citizens of Saudi Arabia. In Saudi Arabia, dental caries was reported in 85.77% of children in the age group 6 years and 71.35% in the 15 years group [20] .",

Silver nano colloids in size range 3 nm-7 nm is an effective optimal dose for inhalation therapy for SARS-CoV-2 infection [23] . It is also reported that for effective antiviral action, the nanoparticles' size must be less than 10 nm. The geometrical limitation between glycoprotein protrusions in the form of spikes of coronaviruses or influenza viruses with the size of 100 nm and the NPs is if less, the NPs can effectively inhibit viral load.

Before the dental caries formation, S. mutans makes a biofilm over the teeth; it metabolizes the fermentable carbohydrates into organic acids with low pH. The formed organic acids corrode the teeth' enamel leading to dental caries [27] . S. mutans is also found to cause endocarditis (Dafani, 1997). S. mutans are also reported to have developed multidrug resistance [28, 29] .",

In the present study, GA-AgNPs were tested against S. mutans, causing dental caries in Fig. 6(a-c) . The tested doses of GA-Ag NPs ranged between 25 g/mL to 200 g/mL. S. mutans growth was highly inhibited. The diameter of the zone of inhibition for 25 g/mL, 50 g/mL, 100 g/mL and 200 g/mL were 14.05 \u00b1 0.7, 15.5 \u00b1 0.8, 16.3 \u00b1 1.0 and 18.30 \u00b1 0.5 nm respectively. The minimum inhibitory concentration of GA-AgNPs for S. mutans was 10.0 g/mL. From the present study, it is evident that the synthesized AgNPs using gum Arabic can be used as an effective oral antibiotic to prevent dental caries by incorporating it with mouth wash and kinds of toothpaste. In S. mutans Glucosyl transference (gtfc gtfD and gtfB) are the virulent genes for plaque formation in biofilm over the tooth surface. The inhibition of the three glucosyltransferase genes impairs the colonization and biofilm formation by S. mutans [30] . The gene gtfD lies in a distant locus from gtfB, gtfC and gbpB (Fig. 7a-d) . However, it plays a role in the structure of glucans in the biofilm formed by S. mutans. The inhibition of virulence of gftB, gftC and gftD interferes with the virulence of S. mutans and its biofilm formation over teeth that induces dental enamel corrosion and dental caries [30] . The glucan binding protein gbpB is another important virulent generegulating antibiotic sensitivity, oxidative and osmotic stress, cell wall construction, maintaining cell shape, hydrophobic, and biofilm formation [31] . A study showed that the mutation of gbpB gene in S. mutans altered the cell shape of S. mutans, leading to growth inhibition [32] . Fujita et al. reported that gbpB genes have several expression patterns according to the strain types of S. mutans [33] . The surface protein antigen 1/11 gene (spaP) is housekeeping genes in S. mutans interact with glycoprotein found in saliva to decide the receptors for the adhesion with teeth or gums, and its inhibition prevents S. mutans attachment with the teeth or gum of the host body [32] .",

Any inhibition of these three genes prevents S. mutans colonization and growth. The competence regulation comDE gene is responsible for bacitracin production, cell formation, and competence [37, 38] . So the inhibition of comDE by GA-AgNPs will paralyze the formation and survival of S. mutans in oral cavity. The gyra A gene studied is also an important virulent gene of S. mutans. The DNA gyrase encoding gyra A is a housekeeping gene offers protection to S.mutans against antibiotics and environmental stress [38, 39] . In the present study, the synthesized GA-AgNPs inhibited the virulence of gyra Agene. From the evaluation of GA-AgNPs molecular inhibition of S. mutans showed that the different sets of genes, gtfB, gtfC, gtfD and gbpB responsible for biofilm formation, brpA, smu 360 and comDE responsible for protective extracellular matrix over S. mutans and spaP and gyrA genes for the survival of S. mutans in odd oral cavity ambiance are all inhibited [40] . The virulence gene expression study further strengthens the inhibitory action over the oral pathogen S. mutans causing dental caries and other diseases like endocarditis by GA-AgNPs by well diffusion assay.",
