Clustering of susceptible subjects in certain bays could theoretically lead to different attack rates.

Movements of the index case patient around the ward could have spread the infection to the other bays through direct contacts or droplets, but he was very ill during his first week of hospitalization and was bed-bound in the same bed [8] . Some inpatients in the ward were ambulatory, but it was most unlikely that many inpatients visited the index case patient and contracted the disease directly from him. They could also have acquired the infection in common areas that had been contaminated, such as the toilets, but because inpatients in the different bays were not particularly bed-bound or ambulatory, their probability of contracting the infection should not differ.

However, nursing duties in our ward were assigned by function and not by patient groups or geographical areas in the ward, as commonly practiced in other places. Our interviews confirmed that all nurses serving in the ward cared for inpatients in all 4 bays during each shift. All physicians in the ward also had to visit different inpatients in all 4 bays. The HCWs could potentially spread the virus to other inpatients through their unwashed hands after making contacts with the index case. Because every nurse had a chance of contacting different inpatients in the different bays, the risk of infection should be distributed more evenly among the different bays.

Clinical details of the index case have been described in 2 earlier reports [8, 15] . The release of a large amount of virus into the air by the index case patient through coughing around 6 March probably caused the first wave of infections, which mainly affected inpatients staying in the same and adjacent bays.

SARS was unlikely a communicable disease with obligate airborne transmission, such as tuberculosis, but there was evidence to suggest that SARS could have at least opportunistic airborne transmission under special circumstances when virus-laden aerosols could be generated [16] . The virus-laden aerosols could come from the nebulizer [17] or the nuclei resulting from the rapid evaporation of the droplets produced by coughing in a relatively dry, air-conditioned environment.
