Reported seroprevalence for SARS-CoV-2 infection in Rio de Janeiro in June 2020 was 7.5% [7] . Only a quarter of the antibody-positive patients in our cohort reported mild symptoms, which did not require medical assistance. Diarrhea was the most frequent symptom, followed by fever and cough, and no patient with negative serology reported previous symptoms. At the time of writing this report, we have found no prospective study describing the seroprevalence and clinical features of COVID-19 in immunocompromised pediatric patients, regardless of the presence of symptoms. Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, efforts have been made to determine the characteristics of this disease in specific groups of patients. It is already known that children have a milder course of the disease and better outcomes than adults [8] , and the few studies that evaluated immunosuppressed patients infected with SARS-Cov-2 did not show a more severe course of the disease as compared with general population [5, 9] . This may be partially explained by the impaired immune response in these patients, as the severity of the disease depends in part on the host's response to infection [5, 10] . A recent systematic review identified 16 articles on SARS-CoV-2 infection in 110 immunosuppressed patients, only four of whom were children [3] . The seroprevalence in our report was about one-third and only a quarter of patients reported mild symptoms, especially diarrhea and fever, without severe respiratory symptoms. This differs from a study that included immunocompetent children with COVID-19, who had fever and cough as the main symptoms [11] , and from a systematic review that described gastrointestinal symptoms in only 17% of children [9] . In our cohort, the majority of confirmed patients reported no symptoms. The frequency of asymptomatic children infected with SARS-CoV-2 in the general pediatric population is unknown. In China, 4.4% and 15.8% of asymptomatic children were found in two large cohorts of the general pediatric population with confirmed and suspected cases of COVID-19, based on clinical manifestations or history of exposure [2, 6] . These preliminary findings suggest that immunocompromised children infected with SARS-CoV-2 are predominantly asymptomatic and that symptomatic patients have mild forms of the disease. Severe cases of COVID-19 appear to be infrequent in this population.",

Although the manufacturer reports a sensitivity of 98.9% and specificity of 97.6%, a recent meta-analysis showed a sensitivity of 66% and a specificity of 97% for this type of test [12] . As the test used has a lower sensitivity than the test recommended by the WHO (RT-PCR), we consider that the seroprevalence for SARS-CoV-2 may be even greater than that found in this study, mainly in the group of asymptomatic patients. Another limitation is the time when the test was performed. We performed the test during the medical appointment and it had no temporal relationship with symptoms or contact with suspected cases. Therefore, some patients may have been infected in a short period before the test and may have not yet developed antibodies to be detected by the test. But this would also further increase the prevalence found.",
