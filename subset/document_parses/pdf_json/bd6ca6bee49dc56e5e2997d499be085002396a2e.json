[4] [5] [6] Pneumothorax (PNX) and pneumomediastinum (PMD) occurred relatively frequently in mechanically ventilated patients with ARDS, with a reported incidence of up to 15% in recent multicenter randomized controlled trials (RCTs). [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] Unfortunately, management of PNX/PMD frequently is challenging. 12 There are isolated reports of PNX/PMD as a complication of COVID-19 ARDS. [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] However, currently, there are few published data on the incidence and outcome of these complications in this specific patient population. 18 Furthermore, early predictors of PNX/PMD remain poorly described.",

Similar to the authors' study, patients in their case series were ventilated with protective ventilation strategies, and developed PMD after four-to-14 days of mechanical ventilation. 16 In a recently published observational study, Lemmers et al. investigated the incidence of PMD and subcutaneous emphysema in patients with COVID-19 and non\u00c0COVID-19 ARDS, and found a 13% incidence of PMD in COVID-19 ARDS versus 1.9% in non-COVID-19 ARDS. 17 Furthermore, mortality was 56.5% in COVID-19 ARDS patients who developed PMD/subcutaneous emphysema versus 50% of patients who did not. Of note, Lemmers et al. found that patients developed PMD/subcutaneous emphysema despite applying protective mechanical ventilation. In the authors' study, they observed a similar incidence of PMD. Compared with the study by Lemmers et al., the authors investigated daily ventilatory parameters during the first seven days of ICU stay and found no difference between PNX/PMD patients and those who did not develop these complications. In addition, the authors investigated early predictors of PNX/PMD. They found that time from symptom onset to intubation and total bilirubin were the only predictors of these complications. Interestingly, and in contrast to the authors' cohort, Lemmers et al. found Only variables with univariate p value <0.1 were included, after exclusion for collinearity/overfitting. Abbreviations: CI, confidence interval; OR, odds ratio; PAO 2 /FIO 2 , partial arterial oxygen tension-to-fraction of inspired oxygen ratio. that PMD/subcutaneous emphysema was not associated with higher risk of mortality. In another study, Fiacchini et al. investigated the incidence of tracheal complications in 30 patients with COVID-19 ARDS requiring prolonged mechanical ventilation versus a control group of ICU patients without ARDS. 31 In their study, the incidence of PNX was 20%, while the incidence of PMD was 33%. The authors can hypothesize that Fiacchini et al. reported a higher incidence than the authors' group because they investigated the selected group of patients requiring more than 14 days of mechanical ventilation, while the authors included all patients requiring invasive ventilation. Unfortunately, they did not report data on mechanical ventilation parameters other than positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP); therefore, the authors cannot comment on possible differences in ventilation strategies.",

            "text": "Results of the authors' study highlighted, and published data collectively suggested, that patients with COVID-19 ARDS were at higher risk of developing PNX/PMD as compared with patients with ARDS due to non\u00c0COVID-19 causes. Interestingly, this seemed to occur regardless of mechanical ventilation setting, as already suggested in previous studies performed in a mixed ICU population. 36 These findings suggested that SARS-CoV-2 may induce a specific type of lung damage that increases frailty of airways tissue, given also the high risk of serious tracheal complications found in these patients. 31 The pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 lung damage remains poorly understood, but it seems to involve microvascular thrombosis, interstitial inflammatory infiltrates, bradykinin-dependent lung angioedema formation, and endothelial barrier disruption. 37, 38 Actually, the pathophysiology of airway and lung damage in both \"typical\" and COVID-19\u00c0related ARDS remain poorly understood. 39 There is general agreement that diffuse alveolar damage is the main histopathologic feature, including capillary congestion, necrosis of pneumocytes, formation of hyaline membranes, interstitial and alveolar edema, hyperplasia of type 2 pneumocyte, plate-let\u00c0fibrin microthrombi, and diffuse macrophage and lymphocyte inflammatory infiltrate. 40 Airway inflammation also has been reported, 41 and the authors recently proposed that even COVID-19\u00c0related pulmonary vascular thrombotic complications were due to local inflammatory endothelial damage, with a superimposed thrombotic late complication, rather than recurrent thromboembolism from peripheral deep vein thrombosis. 30 It is possible that the inflammatory and ischemic damage to small airways, together with the prolonged mechanical ventilation that COVID-19 frequently requires, led to the increased risk of developing PNX/PMD. However, recent studies suggested that lung damage induced from SARS-CoV-2 is indistinguishable from damage induced by other causes, 42 and whether COVID-19 ARDS represent a typical or atypical form of ARDS remains a matter of debate. [43] [44] [45] With regard to this point, the authors' findings could provide an in vivo anatomic depiction of a possible pathogenetic mechanism underlying PNX/PMD development in ARDS COVID-19 patients. The presence of the so-called Macklin effect implies a rupture along the alveolar tree (primum movens) with centripetal dissection along the bronchovascular sheaths toward the pulmonary hila. 29 This radiologic appearance could, therefore, represent macroscopic evidence of the proposed virus-induced frailty of airways tissue. In further support of this hypothesis, patients with a major baseline lung involvement at ICU admission were found to be more likely to develop PNX/PMD. Finally, a documented tracheal lesion was identified in one patient only in the authors' cohort, and tracheal/main bronchi diameters were not significantly different between patients with and without PNX/PMD. Taken together, these observations worked against the idea of a \"central\" barotrauma as the primum movens of PNX/PMD. Indeed, the authors found that time from symptom onset to intubation was a significant, independent predictor of PNX/ PMD development. A possible explanation for this finding was that delayed intubation increased the risk of self-induced lung injury and, therefore, lung and airway inflammatory damage and fibrosis. 46, 47 Interestingly, total bilirubin levels also were associated with risk of developing PNX/PMD. A possible explanation was that these patients developed right heart dysfunction secondary to hypoxia-induced pulmonary vasoconstriction and pulmonary hypertension or prolonged period of high PEEP during noninvasive ventilation before intubation, with subsequent increased central venous pressure and venous congestion-induced liver damage. 48, 49 Alternatively, increased bilirubin level might simply be a marker of a more severe condition with initial multiple organ dysfunction.",
