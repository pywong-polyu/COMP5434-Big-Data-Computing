This project aimed to explore their impact on bacterial microbiota diversity over time in CF children. Methods: Sixty-one children enrolled in the MUCOVIB multicentre prospective cohort provided 746 samples, mostly nasopharyngeal swabs, throat swabs and sputa which were analysed using culture, specific real-time qPCRs and 16S rRNA amplicon metagenomics. Results: Chlamydia pneumoniae (n = 3) and Mycoplasma pneumoniae (n = 1) were prospectively documented in 6.6% of CF children. Microbiota alpha-diversity in children with a documented C. pneumoniae was highly variable, similarly to children infected with Staphylococcus aureus or Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The transition from routine follow-up visits to pulmonary exacerbation (n = 17) yielded variable changes in diversity indexes with some extreme loss of diversity. Conclusions: The high rate of C. pneumoniae detection supports the need for regular screenings in CF patients. A minor impact of C. pneumoniae on the microbial community structure was documented. Although detected in a single patient, M. pneumoniae should also be considered as a possible aetiology of lung infection in CF subjects.",

CF airways typically harbor early formed complex microbial communities with large interpatient variability (Huang and LiPuma 2016 ). Yet, a complete understanding of the impact of individual pathogens on respiratory bacterial microbiota is currently lacking. New models must take into account polymicrobial infections in biofilm-like structures that may better represent the airway microbiota in CF (O'Toole 2018). These new models must consider dominant bacterial species, but also viruses and M. pneumoniae or C. pneumoniae, which could affect the host directly or indirectly by interacting with other pathogens of the microbial community (Hajishengallis et al. 2011; de Dios Caballero et al. 2017) .",

Limited publications reported on the prevalence of C. pneumoniae and M. pneumoniae in CF patients (Petersen et al. 1981; Emre et al. 1996) , likely as a result of small pediatric cohorts in individual centers and the use of culture and serology rather than molecular assays. In addition, screening for these microorganisms by molecular assays is often only considered when respiratory tract infections lead to severe complications such as pericarditis rather than routinely (Esposito et al. 2006) . The use of metagenomics-based assays might offer more insights on the incidence and the prevalence of these bacteria in CF.",

No difference in alpha diversity indexes was documented from TS collected from patients in whom C. pneumoniae or M. pneumoniae were reported compared to those collected from children infected with S. aureus or P. aeruginosa. The transition from routine follow-up visits to PE (n = 17 documented) yielded both increased or decreased diversity depending on the patient and visit, with some extreme loss of diversity (maximum Shannon and Chao1 change of \u22121.73 and \u2212177.3, respectively). Shannon mean change in transitions to PE was \u22120.14 (IQR \u2212 0.66 to 0.29) whereas Chao1 mean change was of \u221218.6 (IQR \u221228.8 to 8.5). Slightly decreased alpha indexes measures were documented during S. aureus PE (with or without P. aeruginosa), albeit not statistically significantly, likely as a result of the small number of events. Chao1 and Shannon indexes were similar during PE events as during routine follow-up visits for mixed infections and other bacteria.",

The 4.9% (3/61) rate of C. pneumoniae documented in CF is significantly higher than the 0.13% prevalence of C. pneumoniae positive PCRs previously reported from all patients using the same PCR (Senn et al. 2011) , but lower than the 12.5% (4/32) rate previously reported in CF children with PE using culture and serology (Emre et al. 1996) . Furthermore, only one third (19/61) of our CF cohort was on a macrolide prophylaxis during the study period. Only one patient was detected positive for M. pneumoniae, resulting in a 1.6% prevalence, which was similar to that reported in a recent Swiss study of children with respiratory tract infections (Dierig et al. 2020) , and a report from the 1980s in CF patients (Petersen et al. 1981) . This high rate of C. pneumoniae detection in children with CF is in line with the previous reports (Petersen et al. 1981; Emre et al. 1996) , and supports the need for a systematic detection during regular visits by using a chlamydia qPCR. As such, a better estimation of the prevalence of C. pneumoniae in CF patients coupled with a better understanding of their reciprocal inferences with CF respiratory microbiota might provide additional insight into the pathogenesis of CF chronic inflammation. As these obligate intracellular organisms are not susceptible to antibiotics usually prescribed during CF PE, they result in prolonged clinical symptoms requiring longer antibiotic treatments with macrolides (Hammerschlag et al. 1992) . 'Traditional' antibiotics typically impact on bacterial microbiota diversity, which could change one's susceptibility to these not-targeted microorganisms. Furthermore, long-term prescription of macrolide among patients with CF has resulted in improvement of respiratory function and reduction of PE episodes, without fully understanding the exact underlying mechanisms (Southern et al. 2012) . In this regard, documentation and treatment of occult intracellular bacteria might impact progressive lung function decline (Janahi et al. 2005) . Given the higher loads of C. pneumoniae documented from NPS compared to TS, the use of NPS should be privileged. Using a limited number of samples, no impact of C. pneumoniae or M. pneumoniae on Shannon or Chao1 diversity indexes as compared to S. aureus and/or P. aeruginosa-positive TS was documented in our cohort. Interestingly, changes in microbial diversity were generally observed between routine follow-up visits and PE. Whether these changes have an impact on the susceptibility to infections with C. pneumoniae and M. pneumoniae is unknown. Our observations suggest a minor impact of C. pneumoniae on the microbial community structure. However, the small number of samples and the high inter-individual diversity, limited our analyses to measures of alpha-diversity indexes only. Future larger datasets should also consider the evaluation of changes in bacterial composition and taxonomy by using beta-diversity indexes. Future study should also aim to evaluate to what extent changes in the structure of the respiratory microbial community, over time or due to antibiotic treatment, have an impact on the susceptibility to infections with C. pneumoniae and M. pneumoniae.",

Yet, while the qPCR was sensitive enough to detect chlamydial DNA in all sample types (NPS, TS and EXP), only a few reads classified as C. pneumoniae were detected by 16S-based metagenomics in EXP and TS. This suggests that a large proportion of other microbial species in the airway microbiome may potentially hide significant intracellular or fastidious pathogens in metagenomics analyses. Intracellular bacteria with particularly small genomes such as C. pneumoniae or M. pneumoniae only harbour one copy of the 16S rRNA (Kalman et al. 1999; Klappenbach, Dunbar and Schmidt 2000) targeted for amplification and may thereby be more difficult to detect than other common pathogens. These observations support the need for sufficient sequencing coverage and suggest the risk of analyses on rarefied data, specifically when they are not coupled with documentation of pathogens by other methods. In addition, the low amount of chlamydia sequences highlights the importance of the 16S PCR amplification prior to NGS analyses and questions the potential sensitivity of shotgun metagenomics for such cases.",

Regular metagenomics profiling could allow to evaluate the overgrowth of a pathogen and potentially to anticipate PE. Microbial communities were to some extent resilient to PE and antibiotic treatment, but major, stable changes in composition were also documented. While larger-scale studies are obviously needed to better model the effect of intracellular and fastidious bacteria, overall changes in diversity may be difficult to detect, as the baseline diversity varies among patients and decreases with time along disease progression.",

In addition, further large-scale multicentre studies will better delineate the impact of these fastidious and intracellular pathogens on the bacterial alpha and beta-diversity over time, as well as the impact of the change in the bacterial diversity on the susceptibility to infections with C. pneumoniae and M. pneumoniae.

(D), Relative abundance of bacterial genera in TS along time for one patient with a documented symptomatic C. pneumoniae infection at visit V01 (middle patient in panel C). Chlamydia sequences remained lowly abundant (0.01%) in the TS and are hence not visible among other more prevalent (>1%) bacterial species.
