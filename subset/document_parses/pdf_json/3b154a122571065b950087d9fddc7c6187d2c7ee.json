At the same period, on 26 December 2019, in PlosOne journal, Watson et al. identified 43 possible roles of pharmacists in critical situations [1] . All these findings showed the importance of pharmacy as a medical profession, in order to support or to complete the practice of physicians [1] . A few days later, forced by the circumstances, pharmacists had to gradually demonstrate, their capacity to apply these skills. The first cases of pneumonia caused in the world by an unknown agent were announced (on 31 December 2019) [2] . Further, the researchers established that Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a new type of Coronavirus (Coronaviridae Family), produced the infection and was also responsible for a more complex, COVID-19 disease [3] . The rapid spread of this disease and the occurrence of severe cases that triggered major organ damage, including death, led authorities around the world to declare lockdown successively, and on 11 March 2020, WHO declared the COVID-19 pandemic [4] [5] [6] . This pathology affected the whole society, at all levels (medical, social, economic, psychological, etc.), disrupting the activity of the entire population. During the pandemic period, many researchers focused on different COVID-19 issues.",

Thus, the traditional activity of preparation and development of drugs has been gradually replaced by pharmaceutical services that mostly focus on the patients' needs and the particularities of their pathologies [8, 9] . But, with the onset of this pandemic, the activities of all professional categories, including the pharmaceutical activities, have been disturbed and this crisis deeply and continuously marked the practice of pharmacists [10] . Pharmacists are considered the most accessible professionals from the health sector and they support the medical practice [11] .

WHO recognized the important role of community pharmacies in offering support for people with COVID-19 symptoms. Thus, it was recommended that pharmacists should advise people about the necessity of hygiene and social distancing. Additionally, pharmacists had to combat the fake news or misinformation, start home-delivery services, and extend their work schedule [19] . Since the beginning of the crisis, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the USA drafted a guide for pharmacies in order to protect both staff and patients [20] . Simultaneously, the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control also drafted guidelines for pharmacies [21] . Subsequently, other institutions made recommendations for pharmacies. On 24 February 2020, community pharmacies in Italy received some recommendations regarding their practice during the regional critical period. On the other hand, pharmacies had to stay open, but they had to respect the social distancing, and the staff had to use personal protective equipment (PPE) [22] . In some countries (e.g., Croatia), the limited PPE supply had determined the authorities to force the pharmacies' staff to wear face masks only after 13 July 2020 [23] .",

In Australia, the number of medical specialists that could initiate the treatment with hydroxychloroquine was restricted, or the quantity released offlabel was of maximum one box/month/patient or one prescription/month/patient [14] . The Estonian Health Ministry limited the quantity of paracetamol to 2 boxes/patient [42] . The Saudi-Arabian Health Ministry limited the quantity of dietary supplements that boost the immune system to only one pack per customer to prevent the emergence of a black market for such items [45] ; (v) in Rwanda, the Ministry of Trade and Industry applied fines to pharmaceutical companies for increasing drug prices. In order to reduce price speculation and drug shortages, the authorities sent pharmacies a list of drugs in high demand, including their prices [43] . On the other hand, the healthcare insurance company from Croatia allowed pharmacies to dispense drugs with higher prices than the regulated ones, the difference being supported by health insurance. Also, these measures were enforced to solve drug shortages and limit the return of patients in pharmacies [35] .",

At the moment, many countries (Australia, Belgium, France, Ireland, Italy, Norway, Poland, Portugal, UK, USA) permitted the administration of the COVID-19 vaccines by pharmacists (including trained pharmacy students in France) [35, 85] .

Since the beginning of the pandemic, pharmacists elaborated emergency drugs formularies, therapeutic plans, or documents with information on drugs used in COVID-19 in order to support the doctors' activity; they participated in medical teams for treating COVID-19 patients with comorbidities. In addition, alongside doctors, they assessed the treatment. Another important part of their practice was to monitor drug ADRs and drug interactions, especially in critical patients or patients treated with narrow therapeutic index drugs [31, 76, 97, 101, 104] . Clinical pharmacists had to ensure that the off-label drug usage was appropriate. Thus, they had to monitor the treatment that could cause ADRs and adjust the doses depending on organ damage. The pharmacological meetings with the medical team were performed by alternative communication methods such as videoconferences or WhatsApp and all therapeutic adjustments were made with the involvement of pharmacists [104] .",

Thus, they had to use different ways of distance communication with patients or medical teams, like telephone, WhatsApp, FaceTime or Skype, written interaction including website-based or Internet platforms (e.g., Pharmadoctor eTool in the UK), video conferences, or even television and radio. All information was supposed to reduce anxiety and increase treatment adherence [48, 56, 76, 93, 101] . The telepharmacy concept was implemented a few years ago, and it represents the delivery of hospital pharmacy services. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the access to the Clinical Pharmacist helpline service from an Inflammatory Bowel Disease unit increased by 228% compared to the pre-COVID-19 pandemic period [108] . A study conducted in Spain showed that several Spanish hospitals introduced online counseling and home drug-delivery services (external courier or hospital's own transport services) forced by the Coronavirus crisis. Thus, a higher number of patients benefited from telepharmacy services. Even if the communication was online, it abided by all the face-to-face procedures, and all pharmacists' interventions were mentioned in the patients' electronic medical file [26] . A study from a cardio-oncology clinic showed that the clinical pharmacists assisted the medical team in a virtual hybrid approach with discussions and medication prescriptions (including review, education, drug interactions, or titrations) in cardiovascular diseases and smoking cessation [109] . However, the limited access to the internet for patients or even for pharmacists was reported, which made communication difficult [42] .",

The published studies are heterogeneous because the pharmaceutical services are not standardized worldwide. In this respect, our paper tried to offer an overview of pharmaceutical care during the COVID-19 pandemic, even if the level of identified evidence in scientific literature was not particularly complex. Also, the information is not structured on geographical areas because of the lack of homogeneity of the data identified in different publications or public data. The region-structured information could be useful to compare the authorities' decisions and the impact of the COVID-19 pathology on the pharmaceutical care practice.",

The pharmacist is an academic leader and a medical advice provider for patients, medical teams, as well as for the entire population. Beyond the risks, pharmacists have adapted their pharmaceutical care practices, extending their services, and being motivated by a strong sense of professionalism and humanity. Throughout their practice, they added value to the healthcare system in the fight against COVID-19. Together with this crisis, pharmaceutical care entered a new phase, demonstrating the ability of pharmacists to be competent and accessible providers of public health. The pharmaceutical care services are not standardized, differing from country to country, and dependent on the capacity and desire of each national authority to apply them as the main part of public health. It remains to be seen how much these services will evolve and what the official recognition of pharmacists' activities by each authority or institution will be. Future studies should present a way to standardize pharmaceutical care activity. These could provide authorities a tool to monitor and even fund these services, which would help the healthcare system and improve the patients' quality of life. Such tools would also be useful to react to a future health crisis.",
