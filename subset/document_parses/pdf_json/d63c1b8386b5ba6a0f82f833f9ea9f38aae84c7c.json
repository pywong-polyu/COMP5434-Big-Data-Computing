We investigated the effects of statin therapy on the level of C-reactive protein (CRP) or highly sensitive CRP (hs-CRP), a liver-derived marker of systemic inflammation, among stroke patients. Methods. An online search was performed in Scopus, PubMed/MEDLINE, ISI Web of Science, and Google Scholar up to November 2020 to recognize clinical trials investigating the effects of statins on the CRP level in stroke patients. Results. Overall, nine studies (11 treatment arms) with 1659 participants met the inclusion criteria. Six out of 9 studies (8 out of 11 arms) were categorized as studies with a high-quality methodological approach using the Cochrane Collaboration's tool. Data from 5 treatment arms indicated a significant decrease in CRP concentration, and in one treatment arm, CRP concentration did not suggest any considerable alteration following statin therapy. Moreover, two treatment arms showed a significant reduction in hs-CRP concentration and three treatment arms revealed no significant alteration in hs-CRP concentration following statin therapy. Generally, results were heterogeneous and independent of the type of statin, statin dose, treatment duration, and changes in plasma low-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentration. Conclusion. The results suggest that statin therapy could reduce and, therefore, could be considered in these patients as potential anti-inflammatory agents.",

To our knowledge, this systematic review is the first to assess the association between statin therapy and plasma CRP concentrations among patients with stroke. As described in the results, since the population of statintreated patients and follow-up durations were heterogeneous across included studies, we did not conduct a meta-analysis. However, the main finding of the current qualitative study is that statin therapy in stroke patients is associated with reducing CRP as an acute-phase reactant and sensitive marker of systemic inflammation. Furthermore, the role of inflammation as a triggering factor for increasing blood viscosity, promoting plaque formation, and accelerating atherosclerosis, through CRP, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1), and interleukin 6 (IL-6), as nonspecific markers of the acute stage of the systemic inflammatory response, is well established. Thus, there is a complementary relationship between the level of inflammation and atherosclerotic plaque formation [30, 34, 36] .",

Statin therapy has suggested protecting vascular events through anti-inflammatory activities reflected by CRP reductions [32, 34] . Growing evidence of CRP-reducing effects of statins indicates that this class of medications reduces the risk of cardiovascular events in patients with coronary artery disease [37, [39] [40] [41] . In this regard, Ridker et al. demonstrated that statin therapy resulted in a more significant clinical benefit when CRP levels were high and that statins decreased CRP levels in a manner essentially independent of LDL-C levels [42] .",

Moreover, two independent studies demonstrated that administration of atorvastatin 80 mg/day did not affect the concentration of CRP in stroke patients. Muscari and coworkers observed a lack of increase in the CRP level in the atorvastatin group, compared with the significant increase in the placebo group. They conclude that this difference was likely due to the antiinflammatory effect of atorvastatin [29] .

CRP is synthesized mainly by the liver in response to proinflammatory cytokines, particularly IL-6 derived from activated leukocytes, adipose tissue, and in part from the liver [56] . After releasing in the bloodstream, CRP induces upregulation of the vasoconstrictor endothelin-1 and IL-6 by endothelial cells and 7 Mediators of Inflammation increases vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, intercellular adhesion molecule-1, E-selectin, and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) and thus enhances leukocyte recruitment in an inflammatory process [38] . As depicted in Figure 2 , statins possibly reduce IL-6-induced CRP expression in human hepatocytes. At the transcriptional level, statins act on the geranylgeranyl pathway and decrease activation of the transcription factor STAT3, leading to the attenuation of inflammation and neuroprotection effects after stroke.",
