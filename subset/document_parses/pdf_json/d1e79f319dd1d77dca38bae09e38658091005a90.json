            "text": "Virtual reality has gained popularity as an effective training platform in many fields including surgery. However, it has been shown that the availability of a simulator alone is not sufficient to promote practice. Therefore, simulator-based surgical curricula need to be developed and integrated into existing surgical training programs. As practice variation is an important aspect of a surgical curriculum, surgical simulators should support practice on multiple specimens. Furthermore, to ensure that surgical skills are acquired, and to support self-guided learning, automated feedback on performance needs to be provided during practice. Automated feedback is typically provided by comparing realtime performance with expert models generated from pre-collected data. Since collecting data on multiple specimens for the purpose of developing feedback models is costly and time-consuming, methods of transferring feedback from one specimen to another should be investigated. In this paper, we discuss a simple method of feedback transfer between specimens in virtual reality temporal bone surgery and validate the accuracy and effectiveness of the transfer through a user study.",

Despite an emerging body of evidence related to the effectiveness of VR in surgical training [1, 10, 15, 40] , it is clear that the availability of a surgical simulator alone cannot promote best practice amongst surgical trainees. For example, a study in the United States observed that only 14% of surgical residents completed VR training when participation was voluntary [3] . Thus, even when facilities for VR training exist, a lack of awareness, trainee motivation, and limited access to simulators inhibit their usage [22, 25] . To overcome these barriers, an appropriate VR-based curriculum should be developed and integrated into mandatory competency-based surgical training programs [31, 33] .",

The incorporation of the above considerations into a VR-based module of a surgical curriculum is likely to improve trainees' readiness for the operating room. The availability of immediate performance feedback is a required component of deliberate practice [9] . Its purpose is to reinforce strengths, address weaknesses, and foster improvements in the learner by providing insights into the consequences of their actions and by highlighting the differences between intended and actual results [33] . While some simulators provide feedback by means of an expert supervising practice [6, 27] , others have been developed with in-built real-time procedural feedback. For example, a dental simulator exists that compares the user's tool position, tool orientation and force application to an expert data set, and displays its feedback on the screen [30] . Similarly, Sewell et al. [32] have developed a system that provides real-time feedback on bone visibility, drilling velocity and force. The University of Melbourne VR Temporal Bone Surgery Simulator [26] provides step-by-step procedural feedback [38] and technical verbal feedback on drill handling skills [7, 18, 19, 41, 42] .",

Although the feature space (metrics on which feedback should be provided) is the same, the values that these metrics take may differ according to anatomical variations between specimens. Therefore, the transfer of feedback from one specimen to another can be characterised as a domain adaptation problem [2] . It is not practical to obtain labelled data for each new specimen to train a new model or to retrain an existing one. As such, unsupervised learning (such as, instance weighting for covariate shift, selflabelling methods, changes in feature representation, and cluster-based learning [20] ) is commonly used in solving problems of this form.",

We assume that the source and target specimens are similar enough that changes in the values of metrics (features) that feedback is provided on between specimens are negligible. This enables direct transfer of a feedback model of one region in the original specimen to the corresponding region in another specimen. Using this method, we transfer the neural network based model developed for providing technical feedback in VR temporal bone surgery in Ma et al. [18] to new specimens.

This is a common procedure performed to remove mastoid air cells as a treatment for chronic otitis media, with or without cholesteatoma or mastoiditis. It is also performed as an initial step of cochlear implant surgery and various lateral skull base operations.

As such, different behaviour models were trained for different regions and used to provide technical feedback. Figure 2 shows an overview of the technical feedback generation process. For the offline training of the neural network classifier, a dataset of 16 surgeries recorded by 7 experts and 34 surgeries from 18 novices was used. The surgical performances were segmented into strokes -continuous drilling motions without abrupt changes in direction [12] . All strokes in expert and novice performances were considered to be expert and novice strokes respectively. The strokes were separated according to the region. Isolation forests [17] were used to remove outliers. Characteristics (or metrics) of each stroke, such as length, duration, speed, and force were then calculated to represent a stroke. These were used to train a neural network with one hidden layer per region. The number of hidden neurons for each region was chosen using cross validation [18] .",

This takes into consideration all aspects of surgical skill, for example, knowledge of landmarks and procedure as well as technical skills. The checklist and global instruments consists of 22 and 10 items respectively, each based on a Likert scale ranging from 1 (unable to perform), through 3 (performs with minimal prompting), to 5 (performs easily with good flow). Comparison of pre-and post-test scores using a Wilcoxon signed rank test showed significant improvement in performance (checklist score: p = 0.001 and global score: p = 0.002).

For example, for an abnormally large specimen, values of feedback metrics such as stroke length may not be directly transferable. In such cases, the region-based method could be used in conjunction with more complicated domain adaptation techniques and/or a limited amount of labelled data from the abnormal or pathological specimens to overcome this. This may also be used to improve the accuracy of transfer between normal specimens. This is a future avenue of research we will explore.",
