We report here on the use of a na\u00efve phage display antibody library to identify a panel of fully human SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies. Following functional profiling in vitro against an early pandemic isolate as well as a recently emerged isolate bearing the D614G Spike mutation, the clinical candidate antibody, STI-1499, and the affinity-engineered variant, STI-2020, were evaluated for in vivo efficacy in the Syrian golden hamster model of COVID-19. Both antibodies demonstrated potent protection against the pathogenic effects of the disease and a dosedependent reduction of virus load in the lungs, reaching undetectable levels following a single dose of 500 micrograms of STI-2020. These data support continued development of these antibodies as therapeutics against COVID-19 and future use of this approach to address novel emerging pandemic disease threats.",

            "text": "While vaccines have been among the most effective means in preventing and containing widespread infections caused by many pathogens, their development is often faced with drawbacks, including long development timelines, large clinical trial sizes, and uncertain efficacy due to the reliance on patientgenerated immune responses to the antigens 7, 8, 9 . Of note, it has been shown in the context of multiple virus infections that virus-specific antibodies can lead to exacerbation of disease symptoms through a process termed antibody dependent enhancement (ADE) 10, 11 . This ADE of virus infection is a phenomenon in which certain virus-specific antibodies enhance the entry of virus due to engagement between IgG Fc regions and Fc-receptors on the surface of monocytes leading to productive infection of these cells rather than virus clearance 12, 13 . In addition, the presence of immunodominant epitopes, i.e. highly immunogenic sequences, in viral antigens can skew this immune response, resulting in production of antibodies that are neither neutralizing nor protective, as seen in the vaccine development against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) 14 . In the case of SARS-CoV-2, nAbs targeting the Spike protein have been isolated from the sera of convalescent COVID-19 patients as well as from sera donated by healthy normal patients prior to December 2019 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20 . While the patients' immune systems generated these nAbs, they often recognize the same region of the Spike protein or even a similar epitope due to immunodominant regions of the Spike protein 21, 22 . One way to overcome this inherent immune bias is the use of an artificial immune system in a test tube, namely phage display human antibody libraries, which allows for functional unbiased selection of Spike-binding antibodies irrespective of the underlying natural immunogenicity 23 .",

Affinity maturation of STI-1499 resulted in identification of STI-2020, an antibody with a 35-fold increased affinity for the SARS-CoV-2 Spike receptor-binding domain (RBD) leading to a greater than 50-fold increase in virus neutralization potency against live WA-1/2020 and 2020001 viruses in vitro.

This approach complements the isolation of nAbs collected from natural sources, such as convalescent patients or vaccinated healthy individuals, and allows for isolation of nAbs recognizing neutralizing epitopes developed outside the temporal and biological context of the pathogen/antigen-specific immune response. The parental nAb STI-1499 and the affinity-matured derivative STI-2020 were characterized for their biochemical and function properties in vitro and in vivo against prevalent clinical isolates of SARS CoV-2. Both nAbs demonstrated potent functionality in these assays, which is strongly supportive of continued preclinical and clinical development. Notably, demonstration of improvement in neutralizing potency in vitro for STI-2020 over that of STI-1499 was predictive of increased protective efficacy in the hamster challenge model following post-exposure therapeutic treatment. In addition, in vivo efficacy was achieved in the presence of the ADE-mitigating LALA Fc modification, providing further confidence that this modification might add to the utility of nAbs under clinical evaluation for use in the treatment of COVID-19. Studies aimed at establishing the therapeutic and prophylactic treatment window in the hamster model as well as demonstrating efficacy following administration of nAb proteins by nonparenteral routes are currently underway.",

Treatments using STI-2020 nAb protein or DNA-encoding of nAbs in combination with other identified nAbs targeting non-overlapping epitopes on the Spike S1 subunit to constitute a nAb cocktail approach will provide a means of increasing the barrier to treatment resistance as the prevalence of naturally emerging and treatment-associated virus variants increases.

This has enabled an efficient and expedited discovery and development of SARS-CoV-2 nAbs starting in March 2020, thus taking less 6 months from initiation of the project to completed IND filing. Notably, STI-1499 has recently received FDA clearance to commence first-in-human studies making it the first clinical-stage anti-SARS-CoV-2 nAb derived not from convalescent patients but from a fully human phage display antibody library, and it is anticipated that dosing of the first patients will begin in October 2020. panned for SARS-CoV-2 Spike S1 subunit-binding scFv fragments. Following confirmation of binding activity and blocking of S1:ACE2 interactions by candidate scFvs, the most potent of these candidates were converted to IgG1 antibodies bearing the LALA Fc modification. Candidate nAbs were characterized for binding of Spike S1 subunit and neutralization of related clinical SARS-CoV-2 isolates. Affinity maturation of potent nAbs was carried out in parallel to biophysical profiling, cell line development, and evaluation of protective efficacy for the parental nAb, STI-1499. and STI-2020. The antibody affinities were measured using SPR on a BIAcore T200 instrument. Competing interests: Sorrento authors own options and/or stock of the company.

Animals inoculated with 1x10 5 TCID50 of SARS-CoV-2 intranasally were treated with either STI-1499 (Figure 4) or STI-2020 (Figure 5) administered intravenously (IV) at 1 hour post-infection. Weight change as a percentage of starting weight was recorded and graphed for each animal (Figures 4 Panel A, Figure 5 Panel A). Animals in the STI-1499 treatment groups were administered a single dose of either 50, 500, or 2000 \uf06dg IV. To control for effects of the virus infection on animal growth, uninfected animals (UI) were administered 2000 \uf06dg of the control IgG1 (IsoCtl) IV. Animals in this group displayed no clinical signs and gained weight throughout the course of the experiment. Hamsters infected with SARS-CoV-2 and administered 2000 \uf06dg of IsoCtl experienced steady weight loss over the first five days of infection, with maximal average weight loss % in this group reaching -5.7% \u00b1 3.3 at 5 days-post-infection (d.p.i.). The duration and degree of weight loss in the 50 \uf06dg and 500 \uf06dg STI-1499 treatment groups were similar to that of animals administered IsoCtl mAb. Following administration of 2000 \uf06dg STI-1499, animals experienced transient minor weight loss over the first two days post-infection followed by steady weight gain on subsequent days. By day 4 d.p.i., and continuing on until the end of the experiment on 10 d.p.i., the effects on SARS-CoV-2 infection on the average % weight change of animals treated with 2000 \uf06dg STI-1499 was significantly different than that in animals treated with control IgG (Figure 4, Panel C). Animals treated with 2000 \uf06dg STI-1499 began to gain weight by day 3 d.p.i. and had reached an average weight gain of 5.8% \u00b1 4.1 by 10 d.p.i. while animals treated with IsoCtl mAb continued to lose weight until 5 d.p.i. and, on average, only returned to day 0 weight levels by 10 d.p.i.. At 5 d.p.i., lungs from 5 out of 10 animals (designated prior to initiation of the experiment) from each experimental group were harvested and virus titers were quantified as TCID50/g. Treatment with 2000 \uf06dg STI-1499 resulted in an average lung titer of 1.38 x 10 4 TCID50/g of tissue, an approximately 27-fold reduction compared to average lung titers in IsoCtl-treated animals. Notably, lungtiters for three of the five animals from the 2000 \uf06dg STI-1499 group were below the limit of detection (<3.6x10 2 TCID50/g). The remaining two animals displayed lung titers approximately 10-fold below that of the IsoCtl-treated group. Consistent with a partial protective effect following a dose of 500 \uf06dg of STI-1499, the average TCID50/g of lung tissue among animals in this treatment group were reduced 2.5-fold as compared to the IsoCtl treatment group.",
