Consequently, the development of quadrivalent influenza vaccines (QIVs) containing antigens derived from two A strains and the two B strains has been of significant benefit, with these vaccines offering additional protection compared with TIVs in terms of B strain mismatch [6] . As reported by Palekar et al., influenza viruses of both B/Yamagata and B/Victoria lineage circulate each year in Latin American and Caribbean countries, with 4500-7000 cases of B strain disease reported within the region annually during 2010-2017 [7] . Jamotte et al. estimate that the use of QIV in Brazil, Colombia, and Panama would significantly reduce the burden of seasonal influenza disease in these countries [8] . Studies from Mexico and Brazil have shown that the use of quadrivalent rather than trivalent vaccines in these countries would be cost-effective [9] [10] [11] . These and other data suggest that the introduction of QIV in Argentina could potentially be of benefit.",

As the SISA largely collects information from the public healthcare sector, the incidence rates of influenza were adjusted to include ILI cases occurring within the social security and private sectors, as described previously by Nguyen et al. [15] . As previously reported [15] , the model also assumed that in the \u2265 65-year-old age group-whose healthcare cover is mainly provided by the social security program for retirees and pensioners \"Programa de Atenci\u00f3n M\u00e9dica Integral\" (PAMI)-40% of consultations were conducted with public rather than private sector effectors.",

However, these average, age group-specific incidence rates were estimated in the context of partial TIV population coverage, given that the influenza vaccination program was first implemented in Argentina in 2011. Thus, these rates include vaccinated and non-vaccinated individuals, and are also influenced by levels of vaccine efficacy and vaccination coverage. Therefore, in order to estimate an influenza incidence rate in the non-vaccinated population, the following formulas were used in the model: nonvaccinated incidence (In-v) = Itiv/((1-PRF) + ((1-VC) + (1-EfTIV)*VC)* PRF); where: Itiv = current incidence (vaccination with TIV); VC = vaccination coverage; PRF = proportion of the population with risk factors; EfTIV = efficacy of TIV; and EfQIV = efficacy of QIV. In the case of the 6 month-< 2-year-old and \u2265 65-year-old age groups, PRF was not applied because the entire cohort was considered to be a population \"at risk\"; therefore, the applied formula was: non-vaccinated incidence (In-v) = Itiv/((1-VC) + VC*(1-EfTIV)). Thus, incidence rates of influenza without vaccination were estimated for each age group and were applied to the model ( Table 1) .",

Age-specific vaccine efficacy values for TIV and QIV were taken from Tricco et al. [20] and considered similar levels of efficacy against A strain viruses for both TIV and QIV (58-61%; Table 1 ). The efficacy of QIV was considered to be similar against both B/Yamagata and B/Victoria, and similar to the efficacy of TIV against matched B strains (66-77%). Thus, estimated QIV incremental vaccine efficacy is directly affected by B strain circulation and mismatch, and may vary from season to season. In our base case model and considering the 2014-2019 period with an average B strain mismatch of 34.24%, average age-specific QIV incremental vaccine efficacy was 4.10-4.79%. However, if we considered the 2016 season with B strain mismatch of 8.30%, and the 2017 season with B strain mismatch of 87.50%, estimated QIV incremental vaccine efficacies were 0.66-0.77% and 9.24-10.78%, respectively. In addition, studies have described TIV as providing cross-protection against the B lineage not included in vaccines at 68% of the efficacy observed against the included B lineage; however, other randomized clinical trials report either insignificant or low levels of cross-protection [31, 32] . Therefore, given the lack of certainty around this issue, the base scenario of our analysis did not consider cross-protection. The cross-protection variable was only included in the sensitivity analysis.",

The direct costs of treating influenza considered the costs of hospitalization, GP visits, laboratory testing, and radiologic images, and were obtained from previous reports (Table 1) [12, 15, 21] . In all cases, values were updated according to the price inflation index of the Argentine healthcare system with an exchange rate of 1.000 U.S. dollar (USD) = 61.350 Argentine pesos (ARS). Given that unit costs were taken from local tariffs, which are known to underestimate real values, a cost increase was applied according to the Moscoso and Clark index for those under 65 years of age (those \u226565 had already been adjusted), as in our previous study [15, 34] . Following the human capita approach, indirect costs applied for only the 18-64-year-old group, and were estimated considering the average monthly take-home pay of employees in 2019, adjusted by the unemployment rate in 2019 using data from the Ministry of Labor, Employment and Social Security, and the National Institute of Statistics and Censuses (INDEC) [22, 23] .",

As part of our univariate analyses, a deterministic tornado-type sensitivity analysis was performed using a \u00b1 20% value for each variable following a triangular distribution ( Figure 5 ). Lastly, we constructed (1) a more favorable scenario with high B strain mismatch (at 87%) because this was reported for the 2017 season and could be repeated, and (2) another less favorable scenario considering TIV-induced cross-protection at a level described by Tricco et al.

Currently in Argentina, the National Immunization Program recommends annual receipt of TIV for individuals classified as \"at risk\". While the TIV immunization strategy has largely been successful, correctly predicting which of the two possible B strain lineages should be included in the TIV each season is an ongoing challenge in Argentina, as it is in the rest of the world. Therefore, the introduction of QIV offers the benefit of guaranteed coverage for both B/Yamagata and B/Victoria strains each year. To date, no peer-reviewed scientific papers have been published reporting analyses of QIV cost-effectiveness in Argentina. Given the absence of data in this area, the usefulness of such analysis, and the benefits of such a study in providing information to public health policy makers, we evaluated the cost-effectiveness of QIV in Argentina compared with the current TIV immunization strategy. Briefly, QIV was estimated to be cost-effective relative to TIV, preventing 19,128 cases of influenza, 16,164 influenza-associated GP visits, 2440 complicated ambulatory cases, 524 hospitalizations, and 82 influenza-related deaths annually.",

When defining seasons of co-dominance between the B lineages as mismatch seasons, the rate of B strain mismatch during 2010-2017 increased to 52% of seasons [7] .

The cost-effectiveness of QIV would be higher in seasons of high B strain predominance and mismatch, and lower in seasons of low-level B strain circulation and mismatch. These benefits would be markedly reduced when TIV-induced cross-protection against the mismatched B strain is considered; this is a field where information is still scarce and very dissimilar, but which could undoubtedly impact cost-effectiveness.

Although during the first pandemic year the circulation of influenza viruses was very low in Argentina and other regional countries, the co-circulation of both viruses could occur thereafter, demanding strategies to manage the burden of disease from these two pathogens in parallel [47] . Co-infection with influenza and SARS-CoV-2 is known to occur [48] [49] [50] [51] . In addition, influenza and SARS-CoV-2 infections are both most severe in the same high-risk populations-older adults, the immunocompromised, and those with pre-existing cardiovascular and respiratory conditions. Thus, optimal measures are required to minimize the impact of influenza in order to spare the essential resources needed to effectively manage the COVID-19 pandemic. Given that co-circulation and co-infection are likely to occur in the future, it is reasonable to suggest that combined or concomitant administration of seasonal influenza and SARS-CoV-2 vaccines to high-risk/at-risk populations may be a logical and beneficial public health strategy. However, it should be noted that, at the time of this publication, given the lack of safety and efficacy data on COVID-19 vaccines being administered simultaneously with other vaccines, co-administration is not currently recommended [52] .",

            "text": "Limitations to this study include the use of international evidence rather than Argentine data to estimate some model parameters, including rates of hospitalized cases and complicated ambulatory cases. Another limitation is that real incidence rates for a non-vaccinated population are simply unobtainable in Argentina, because almost a decade has passed since the start of the influenza vaccination program. This obstacle was overcome by other researchers by the inclusion of the incidence of randomized clinical trials where vaccine efficacy was originally tested in their models [10, [55] [56] [57] . However, these trials have been conducted in other countries, many of them in the northern hemisphere, where climate issues and population behavior may affect influenza attack rates in a very different way, and hence may not be representative of local epidemiology. Thus, we preferred to estimate the non-vaccinated population incidence based on local information taking into consideration the current incidence rate of influenza among TIV recipients, rates of vaccination coverage, and TIV efficacy. In addition, estimated incidence rates were based mainly on public sector data and assumed a degree of underreporting, real incidence rates are therefore likely to be higher than those predicted. Finally, although in Argentina the use of antiviral medication among hospital outpatients and in the private sector is generally low, it should be noted that antiviral use was not taken into consideration in our model.",
