State-cluster demographic data and health indicators were analyzed in reference to epidemiologic measures, with logistic regressions for the dependent variables of incidence, confirmation, and lethality. Results: The national incidence was 13.89/100,000 inhabitants with a 6.52% overall lethality and a confirmed-case mortality of 11.1%. The incidence variation significantly correlated with migration, but not urbanization. Pediatric patients were less prone to be tested (OR = \u22123.92), while geriatric individuals were a priority. State lethality positively correlated with the proportion of the population assisted at public hospitals and correlated inversely to the number of hospitals and clinics in the state. Conclusions: Migration strongly correlated with incidence; elderly patients had lower odds of being hospitalized but were likely to die. Patients aged <15 were less prone to be laboratory-confirmed.

Although they might seem discordant, our results show a lower confirmation and hospitalization in state-clusters with more availability of clinics and hospitals. Furthermore, this could be related to the fact that the national strategy for the COVID-19 contingency explicitly asked that only public laboratories were allowed to perform diagnostic tests. In addition, it was established that the hospitals allowed to provide medical assistance to COVID-19 patients were mandatorily designated and, initially, those hospitals were only public institutions.

Nevertheless, states with higher population access to public healthcare had greater lethality than those with access to private healthcare. The lethality may reflect the inequities present in public healthcare, such as a lack of resources to ventilators and medication, as well as higher number of patients seeking public healthcare, possibly prompting increased demand for more robust public services.

Therefore, incidence comparisons in the studied period between Mexico and other countries may not be appropriate. Lethality in Mexico for the present communication was estimated using both suspected and confirmed cases; thus, it may seem incomparable to the standard estimations worldwide, where confirmed-case mortality is commonly employed. The observed confirmed-case mortality of 11.1% in Mexico may mean that Mexico ranks fourth place among the world's countries with the highest mortality, only after France (25.4%), Italy (14.4%) and United Kingdom (14.2%), and equal to Sweden-all European countries where the COVID-19 epidemic started earlier. In consequence, Mexico is the country with the highest confirmed-case mortality in Latin America, followed by Ecuador (8.5%) and Brazil (5.6%). Nevertheless, these comparisons should be carefully considered as it has been described how in places where testing rates are lower, case-confirmation lethality may be overestimated [23] . Inaccuracy occurs when the real number of cases remains unknown or miscalculated [24] and because elderly patients with severe manifestations are more prone to be tested. In sentinel surveillance, the most vulnerable patients are prioritized for sampling due to their conditions by definition.

A clinical series study conducted in Wuhan included patients with and without comorbidities, and a median age of 56 and a lethality of 4.3% was observed [29] .
