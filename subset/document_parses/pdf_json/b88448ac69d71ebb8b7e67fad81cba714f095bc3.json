            "text": "Regenerative medicine is a medical treatment that aims to restore lost human body functions by regenerating missing or dysfunctional organs and tissues using stem cells, etc. There are three major types of stem cells used in regenerative medicine: induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS cells), embryonic stem cells (ES cells), and mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). MSCs are expected to be widely applied to regenerative medicine because of their ability to differentiate into various types of cells, repair cells and tissues; anti-inflammatory effects; secretion of various growth factors; and resolution of abnormally accumulated protein amyloid. MSCs can be derived from bone marrow, dental pulp, and other sources, but adipose tissue-derived stem cells (ADSCs) may be superior in that they can be harvested with the least amount of invasion, and therefore, a sufficient amount of stem cells can be cultured relatively easily. When MSCs are administered systemically by intravenous infusion, they tend to accumulate at the site of disease, a property known as \"homing,\" which is extremely advantageous for clinical applications. In Japan, stem cell therapy can be performed only after the research or treatment plan has been reviewed and approved by the \"Committee for Specific Approval of Regenerative Medicine\" and submitted to the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare for approval in accordance with the \"Act on Securing the Safety of Regenerative Medicine\" and after approval by the ethics committee of the facility where the therapy is performed. In this review, the characteristics of MSCs, the actual status of their clinical application, and their future prospects are presented.",

Although MSCs have some advantages over the other two types of stem cells, such as not requiring genetic manipulation, no particular risk of cancer, and no ethical issues, they do not have a high differentiation potential and have not yet been applied to produce the desired tissue or organ. The main reason for the clinical application of MSCs is not the regeneration and transplantation of tissues and organs but the ability to repair damaged tissues and organs or the cells that make them up. MSC therapy consists of administration of undifferentiated stem cells, and iPS cells and ES cells are always differentiated before administration; this is the crucial difference between them, i.e., iPS cells or ES cells and MSCs.",

In Parkinson's disease, neurons in the substantia nigra of the midbrain are damaged, but iPS cells are transplanted into the striatum instead of the midbrain. The reason for this is that transplantation into the midbrain is technically risky, it is difficult for neurons differentiated from iPS cells to extend their neuronal processes into the striatum, and a certain effect is expected if dopamine is secreted in the striatum. Because the substantia nigra-striatal system is located bilaterally, the transplantation surgery should be performed bilaterally or, in other words, twice.",

The first human subject was implanted with iPS cell-derived cardiomyocyte sheets in January 2020 (15) . Because iPS cells can be differentiated into a variety of tissues, they have potential applications for a number of diseases. In this case, it is especially important that the cells are, first of all, fully differentiated, i.e., no undifferentiated cells remain; otherwise, they may differentiate against their intended purpose after transplantation, and tumor formation is a particular problem. Because iPS cells use genetic recombination technology, there should be no expression of abnormal genes after transplantation. Efforts to match HLA types are important to prevent rejection. To date, there has been no evidence of cancer, rejection, or abnormal gene expression in clinical applications. Of course, the application of iPS cells in nonclinical research, such as drug development, is one of the major applications of iPS cells, and in this case, \"side effects\" such as abnormal gene expression and canceration will not be as much of a problem as in transplantation.",

De Bari et al. discovered synovium-derived MSCs (25) , and Zuk et al. discovered adipose tissue-derived MSCs (ADSCs) (26) , both in 2001. MSCs can be obtained from a number of tissues, including the umbilical cord, fetal appendages such as the placenta and amnion (27) , and dental pulp (28) .",

Among them, hematopoietic stem cells, which reside in bone marrow, were the first to be studied for more than half a century, and their clinical application has been actively pursued. The establishment of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation has opened up the possibility of transplantation therapy using any tissue stem cells. However, the difficulty of the isolation of stem cells from some tissues, for example brain and heart, makes it difficult to use them for therapy. Fortunately, though, MSCs have been found to have the ability to differentiate into not only mesodermal cells such as osteoblasts, adipocytes, myocytes, and cartilage cells but also endodermal cells such as visceral tissues and ectodermal cells such as neurons and are expected to be widely applied to \"regenerative medicine.\"",

The Ministerial Ordinance for Partial Revision of the Ordinance for Enforcement of the Act on Securing the Safety of Regenerative Medicine and the Ordinance for Enforcement of the Clinical Research Act (Ordinance of the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare No. 14 of 2021) came into effect on February 1, 2021. These laws allow regenerative medicine using stem cells to be performed even if it is not covered by insurance (the principle of medical treatment in Japan is to be covered by insurance, and all citizens are insured) as long as it is discussed and approved by the Committee for Approval of Specific Regenerative Medicine, etc., and then approved by the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare. This therapeutic research requires the creation of a protocol, preparation of explanatory documents for the patients to be treated, explanation to the patients, and obtaining consent from the patients, and the results are treated in the same way as a clinical trial in determining whether to apply for insurance coverage. All of the treatments and studies approved in this way are posted on the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare's website for anyone to view (https:// www.mhlw.go.jp/stf/seisakunitsuite/bunya/ 0000186471.html). The \"Regenerative Medicine Consultation Room\" website summarizes these studies and treatments by target organ (http://www.rm-promot.com/). Hundreds of therapeutic studies are currently underway, supported by the legal system described above. Even for spinal cord injuries, which are difficult to treat, improvement in motor and sensory dysfunction was reported with the administration of MSCs (55) , (56) . Furthermore, for neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (49) , ALS, Parkinson's disease, and intractable pulmonary diseases such as COPD and pulmonary fibrosis, for which there is no treatment to inhibit disease progression, therapeutic studies are being conducted using repeated intravenous administration of MSCs, especially autologous ADSCs, and the therapeutic effects are expected to be verified. As of August 2021, the patient with ALS reported in the case report, who was presented at the 40th World Congress of the International College of Surgeons (ICS) in 2016 (October 23-26) (Program & Abstracts p. 139 Hisakazu Yamagishi) is alive and well without a respirator or gastrostomy, although he is walking with a cane (57) . Deposition of abnormal proteins in the brain has been found in many neurodegenerative diseases. The ability of MSCs to remove these abnormal proteins, together with their ability to repair neurons and myelin, may offer hope for the treatment of a number of neurodegenerative diseases that would otherwise be progressive and untreatable (58) . Clinical research on MSCs has been very active, and their effects have been reported successively. Repeated infusion of ADSCs for Parkinson's disease has been reported to improve MDS-UPDRS, although it is an open-label pilot study (59) . Double-blind randomized controlled trials, often costly and sometimes ethically challenging, are the golden standard for determining clinical efficacy. If MSCs are given for progressive disease and symptoms improve or stop progressing, the effect may be considered in comparison to the best that could be achieved without the treatment. Even so, further validation is needed and well worthwhile.",

MSC homing is defined as the arrest of MSCs within the vasculature of a tissue, followed by transmigration across the endothelium (60) .

MSCs promote a prothrombotic state after exposure to blood, in which the mechanisms are attributed to the so-called instant blood-mediated inflammatory reaction (IBMIR) (64) . The tissue factor expression and procoagulant activity of MSCs vary depending on the tissue origin, more so in adipose than in bone marrow, and on culture time. There is a risk of embolization with intravenous MSCs (65) . Because intravenously administered MSCs go from the vena cava through the right atrium and right ventricle to the lungs first, it is necessary to be careful of pulmonary embolization. The risk of pulmonary embolism is associated with the number of cells administered and the rate of administration (66) . MSCs, especially autologous MSCs, are considered safe, but because they have only been used for treatment for a rather limited time, there may be unknown side effects. Of course, some invasion, however small, will be added at the time of collection. Because bone marrow harvesting is necessary for bone marrow-derived MSCs and subcutaneous adipose tissue harvesting is necessary for ADSCs, attention must be paid to the safety of such procedures. Although not limited to stem cells, there should be no infection in the culture, and components of xenogeneic animal origin should be avoided when administered to humans.",
