Taking Rio de Janeiro city (Brazil) as a studying case, the first diagnosis of this disease in occurred March 2020, but the exact moment when the local spread of the virus started is uncertain as the Brazilian epidemiological surveillance system was not widely prepared to detect suspected cases of COVID-19 at that time. Improvements in this surveillance system occurred over the pandemic, but due to the complex nature of the disease transmission process, specifying the exact moment of emergence of new community contagion outbreaks is a complicated task. This work aims to propose a general methodology to determine possible start dates for the multiple community outbreaks of COVID-19, using for this purpose a parametric statistical approach that combines surveillance data, nonlinear regression, and information criteria to obtain a statistical model capable of describing the multiple waves of contagion observed. The dynamics of COVID-19 in the city of Rio de Janeiro is taken as a case study, and the results suggest that the original strain of the virus was already circulating in Rio de Janeiro city as early as late February 2020, probably being massively disseminated in the population during the carnival festivities.",

Within a few months, COVID-19 has spread to many countries, which led the World Health Organization (WHO) to declare a pandemic state on March 12th, 2020 8 . This pandemic has been recognized as one of the most serious public health crises faced by humanity in recent history, on an interval fewer than two years, deaths officially registered around the World already add up to more than 5.65 million lives 9,10 until this submission, a health catastrophe not seen since the Spanish flu pandemic 11 in the early 20th century. A key question in this context is to find out, based on reported surveillance data, the moment in time when this disease start inside a community in other parts of the World. The answer to this question may lead to a better understanding of the epidemic propagation routes, and so, can help to establish strategies to refrain future outbreaks.",

It also shows a comparison between new notifications per week and total notifications for cases (bottom left) and deaths (bottom right), where periods of incidence proportional to prevalence (exponential growth) are noticed. In this figure, the raw data are represented in magenta dots and the 7 days moving average by the green curve. Multiple waves of contagion/deaths can be seen, the four most pronounced in April 2020, December 2020, April 2021, and August 2021, respectively. Small oscillations over time, which resembles an endemic period, can also be seen. In addition, the surveillance data for new confirmed cases (top left of Fig. 3 ) also highlights the existence of case notifications in January and February 2020, well before March 1st, the current date where it is already confirmed (through surveillance data) that community transmission had started. These cases, registered by the date reported for the first symptoms, were not counted at the beginning of March 2020 because their registration in the system only occurred a posteriori. For this reason, March 6th was announced that time as the day of the first confirmed case. Although these early records may be due to errors in the registration, due to the provision of false or misleading information by patients, the fact that they are not isolated notifications may suggest that community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in Rio de Janeiro city may have started well before the period close to March 1st, where community transmission is known to have already occurred. As at the beginning of the pandemic the Brazilian epidemiological surveillance system was not prepared to massively register COVID-19 cases, it is not only possible but probable that the introduction of the virus in the community took place in a period earlier than of the current estimates for the starting date of community transmission (March 1st). The early cases mentioned above provide direct, albeit weak (due to possible recording errors or biases), evidence in this sense.",

It is also quite common to describe the evolution of epidemic waves with aid of purely phenomenological models, supported by frequentist [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] [42] [43] [44] [45] or Bayesian 46,47 statistical approaches.",

The third one, on the other side, is rich in methodological detail, presenting a mechanistic framework based on a non-Markovian delayed compartmental model, which provides a relatively general tool for inferring the start date of an outbreak. However, in terms of validating the results, the authors' arguments implicitly rely heavily on the assumptions that the available data are sufficiently accurate and informative to calibrate the dynamic model, and that the latter provides a sufficiently realistic representation of the epidemic outbreak of interest. The scenario where at least one of these assumptions is not valid is not rare, so there is space in the literature for contributions that attack the same problem on other fronts.",

The fundamental idea is to present a procedure that incorporates elements of generality, to be applied in typical epidemic outbreaks, but that is simple enough to be used by researchers who do not have strong training in epidemiology or more advanced statistical methods (e.g. Bayesian inference). In this way, we combine the surveillance data with algebraic multiple waves models, nonlinear regression, and information criteria to obtain a simple but representative mathematical model of the underlying outbreak, which provides an interval estimate for the start date of the referred contagion wave. The proposed methodology is illustrated with aid of COVID-19 data from Rio de Janeiro city, which has complex dynamics, with multiple contagion waves and (the typical) very irregular data.",

In the case of Rio de Janeiro city, they come from two databases: (i) e-SUS VE; and (ii) SIVEP-Gripe. The first records the flu syndrome in ordinary cases, while the second is responsible for the severe acute respiratory syndromes records. Both are compiled (without duplication) by the Municipal Health Department, which makes them available on a website 51 widely accessible to the general public. Data for new cases are organized by the date of first symptoms, while new deaths are recorded by the date of the event.

In practice, as the city of Rio de Janeiro has not adopted a massive random testing policy, only part of the cases of infection by COVID-19 were confirmed with the laboratory tests, essentially those that seek medical attention. Thus, the available data for cases evolution provide a distorted (biased) picture of the epidemiological reality, with far fewer cases reported than the actual number of infected, and with an estimated date for infection beginning shifted in time from the true onset, since the infection onset is estimated by the date of first symptoms (which occurs on average 5 days after the infection event). Death records also suffer from underreporting, but on a much smaller scale, as in this case registration is compulsory. Typically, deaths from COVID-19 that are not counted are those with no formal diagnosis of the disease by a laboratory test. In this setting, the time series for the number of new deaths per day can be considered a proxy to assess the evolution of contagion by the disease, since there is a clear correlation between it and the temporal evolution of the total number of cases (part of the cases evolves to death, more cases occurring, the expectation is more deaths, fewer cases, fewer deaths) 52 .",

As can be seen in Fig. 3 , this treatment helps to display the data evolution pattern. But it should be mentioned that due to the use of only past data in the smoothing (for reasons of causality), the moving average inserts a delay of a few days in the data series.

In this way, by visual inspection of Fig. 3 , it is verified that the first wave of deaths starts between the middle of March and the beginning of April, and ends by the end of June or the beginning of July 2020. Between March and April 2020, the epidemic surveillance system in Rio de Janeiro was still adapting to the pandemic, testing to determine if death from respiratory disease was due to COVID- 19 was not yet mandatory, so that underreporting in this period (certainly above average) can bias the estimate of the outbreak start date. In May 2020, on the other side, the COVID-19 death tracking system was better developed, so the first wave phase records should not be so biased. Thus, for the sake of minimizing bias during statistical model calibration, the training data considered here uses the time series of new deaths per day between May 1st and July 1st. Table I shows the values of the parameters found in the calibration process for a single wave model, the estimated date for the epidemic outbreak start, as well as the quality metrics of the fitting and information criteria, for several scenarios of the parameter \u03c4, which represents the instant of inflection of the logistic model (the peak of the incidence curve). These multiple scenarios are considered because the evolution of a patient who dies, between the time of infection and death, has a variable duration. Therefore, considering a range of possible dates around the peak of the data (April 28, day 127 of the time series) is a strategy to reduce the influence of this uncertainty on the inference process. By generating a family of possible curves (ensemble of models), the adopted information criteria (AIC and BIC) and the known facts about the outbreak will indicate which of those curves are a plausible representation for the wave of deaths.",

Hawryluk et al. 64 points out that the COVID-19 average time from symptom onset to death in Brazil, during the first wave, was around 15.2 (11.2, 17.8) days, so that a conservative estimate for the upper bound for the date of onset of cases (fifth column of Table I) can be obtained by subtracting 11 days from the date estimated by the curve of deaths (fourth column of Table I ). Furthermore, the fitting metrics of Table I suggest that all the calibrated statistical models have good adherence to the data, which can be visually confirmed in Fig. 5 , which shows 9 candidate models for the single wave incidence curve, each one corresponding to a different value for \u03c4. The corresponding prevalence curves can be seen in the sequence, in Fig. 6 .

It is also noted that models with a lower value of \u03c4 (inflection point furthest from the peak of data) tend to estimate underreporting in death records more conservatively, as their prevalence curves are more detached from the observations (known to be underreported). However, despite the qualitative similarity between all candidate models, from a quantitative point of view, differences exist and materialize themselves in the estimation of the upper bound for the starting dates. These quantitative differences in date predictions are compared with known information about the onset of community transmission, to eliminate models that provide predictions inconsistent with observations.

This figure clarifies a point that may have left doubts in the reader, about the temporal proximity between the fourth and fifth waves. The sum of the two can explain the asymmetry observed in the fall of the fourth wave, which is interpreted in the light of this model as being the superposition of two contagion waves that emerged temporally close. This is a plausible scenario, for example, if there are two key events in the city that are triggers for scaling up contagion events. Or if two regions of the city, geographically not close, experience an increase in contagion almost simultaneously.",
