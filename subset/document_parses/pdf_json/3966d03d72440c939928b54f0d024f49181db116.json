In 88 this study, we sought to understand the prevalence and growth dynamics of this variant in the 89 U.S., from early emergence to rapid onward transmission. Surveillance programs typically select 90 a subset of samples tested by SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR for sequencing, and therefore prioritizing 91 SGTF samples for sequencing serves to enrich for detection of B.1.1.7. Here, we describe the 92 introduction and early spread of B.1.1.7 in the U.S., based on historical SGTF rates in RT-PCR 93 SARS-CoV-2 tests and a nationwide SGTF viral sequencing program. We find that B.1.1.7 94 J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f arrived in the U.S. towards the end of November, 2020 and, as of February, 2021, has since 95 spread to over 40 U.S. states (CDC, 2021) . Importantly, similarly to what has been observed in 96 other countries, we find that the B.1.1.7 variant is 40-50% more transmissible across the U.S., 97 doubling in relative frequency every week to week and a half. These findings show that B.1.1.7 98 will probably become the dominant variant in many U.S. states by March, 2021, likely leading to 99 further surges of COVID-19 in the country, unless urgent mitigation efforts are immediately 100",

We found that the majority of 191 B.1.1.7 sequences from the U.S. cluster into two main clades (Figure 2A) with independent 192 introductions into California (CA; Figure 2A) and Florida (FL; Figure 2A). We also see 193 independent introductions into Georgia (GA; Figure 2A), Pennsylvania (PA; Figure 2A), New 194 York (NY; Supplemental Figure S1A) and Texas (TX-1; Supplemental Figure S1A). 195 In addition to these major clades, we also identified a number of smaller clades representing at 196 least 22 independent introductions (Figure 2A), as well as 16 singletons showing additional 197 introductions (Figure 2A) across the U.S. states (Figure 2B). Among the 22 independent 198 introductions we note nine independent introductions into Florida (FL-1 to FL-9; Supplemental 199 Figure S1A), and three independent introductions into California (CA-1 to CA-3; Supplemental 200 Figure S1A). The \"CA-2\" clade was made up of 11 sequences from California and constituted a 201 separate introduction. The two sequences closest to the base of this clade came from 202 individuals with recent travel history to the U.K, showing evidence for local transmission within 203 the state (CA-2; Supplemental Figure S1A). Clade \"Southeast\" (Supplemental Figure S1A) 204 contains five sequences from Georgia, two from Florida, and two from North Carolina and 205 represents an independent introduction into the Southeastern U.S. 206 We found that the earliest timing of introductions into the U.S. was represented by the \"CA\" 207 clade, which had a median time to the most recent common ancestor (TMRCA; which depicts 208 the likely start of sustained local transmission in California (Grubaugh et al., 2019a)) of 209 December 1, 2020 (95% highest posterior probability: [November 18 -December 10]), followed 210 by \"FL\" with a median TMRCA of December 3, 2020 [November 22 -December 11) (Figure 211 2C). Clade \"GA\" had a median TMRCA of December 26, 2020 [December 18 -January 2) 212 (Figure 2C). Clade \"PA\" had a median TMRCA of January 3, 2020 [December 24 -January 10) 213 (Figure 2C).

This clade clusters within clade \"Mixed-5\" which contains 230 sequences from the Northeastern, Midwestern and Southeastern U.S., indicating widespread 231 transmission of the B.1.1.7 lineage across the U.S. 232 Undersampling and inherent bias of B.1.1.7 sequencing across the U.S. make it unfeasible to 233 estimate directionality and connectedness across the country. However, our finding of clustering 234 of B.1.1.7 sequences into several mixed clades suggest movement of the virus between 235 multiple U.S. states, including between many of the states on the Eastern seaboard, and 236 between Northeastern, Midwestern and Southeastern states in the U.S. (Figure 2D and 237 Supplemental Figure S1D). 238 Discussion 239 The B.1.1.7 variant established itself as the dominant SARS-CoV-2 lineage in the U.K. within a 240 few months after its detection (Bal et al., 2020; Chand et al., 2020). Since then, the variant has 241 been increasingly observed across many European countries, including Portugal and Ireland, 242 which, like the U.K., observed devastating waves of COVID-19 after B.1.1.7 became dominant 243 (ECDC, 2021). In this study, we show that B.1.1.7 is currently at a relatively low frequency in the 244 U.S., but our estimates show that its growth rate is ~7.5% per day and doubling in frequency 245 about every week and a half. These findings are consistent with those from other countries 246 (Volz et al., 2021), and given the current trajectory in the U.S., we expect B.1.1.7 to become the 247 dominant SARS-CoV-2 lineage by March, 2021 across many U.S. states, which is consistent 248 with modeling analyses from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (Galloway et 249 al., 2021). 250 Our phylogenetic analyses indicate that there have been multiple introductions of B.1.1.7 into 251 the U.S., with the earliest dating back as early as the end of November, 2020. These analyses 252 revealed large clades of closely related SARS-CoV-2 lineages clustering within individual states, 253 as well as national spread indicated by several smaller clades defined by mixtures of samples 254 from patients who reside in different U.S. states. These findings are consistent with community 255 transmission following several of these introductions, including spread across the U.S. However, 256 unresolved polytomies of sequences belonging to different regions nationally and internationally 257 at several basal nodes in our phylogenies, mean that we are unable to fully resolve directionality 258 and likely origins for the U.S. sequences (Grubaugh et al., 2019a). However, our TMRCA 259 estimates coincide with increased periods of travel, where the U.S. Transportation Security 260 Administration reported over one million travelers crossing checkpoints for several days during 261 the peak Thanksgiving season (November 20-29, 2020) and for twelve of eighteen days 262 surrounding the Christmas and New Year's holidays (December 18, 2020 to January 4, 2021) 263 (TSA, 2021). This increase in travel provides a likely explanation for how B.1.1.7 may have 264 been introduced via international travel and spread across the U.S. via domestic travel. As more 265 genomes from the B.1.1.7 lineage in the U.S. are sequenced, we expect to be able to identify 266 more independent introductions and an increase in the number of sequences within each 267",

Because laboratories in the U.S. are currently only sequencing a small subset of 297 SARS-CoV-2 samples, the true sequence diversity of SARS-CoV-2 in this country is still 298 unknown. The more established surveillance programs in other countries have provided 299 important early warnings about variants of concern that can impact the U.S., with B.1.1.7 300 representing only one variant that demonstrates the capacity for increased growth. As viral 301 surveillance efforts increase in the U.S., we will no doubt find additional SARS-CoV-2 variants, 302 some at high prevalence and others with increased fitness. Only with consistent, unbiased 303 sequencing at scale that includes all geographic and demographic populations including those 304 often underrepresented, together with continued international scientific collaborations and open 305 data sharing, will we be able to accurately assess and follow new variants that emerge during 306 the COVID-19 pandemic. Given that the SARS-CoV-2 VOCs B.1.1.7, B.1.351, and P.1 are still 307 at relatively low frequency in the U.S., there is still time to scale currently insufficient national 308 surveillance and implement critical control efforts in the weeks to come. Unless decisive and 309 immediate public health action is taken, the increased transmission rate of the B.1.1.7 lineage 310 and resultant higher effective reproduction number of SARS-CoV-2 will likely have severe 311 consequences to COVID-19 mortality and morbidity in the U.S. in the coming months. 312 Limitations of the Study 313 In this study we obtain robust estimates for the growth of B.1.1.7 from California, Florida, and 314 Georgia. Our sampling within each state, however, is biased by the location of Helix's 315 commercial partners. Though geographic spread of the zip codes of patients obtaining Helix's 316 COVID-19 tests cover 89, 99, and 94% of California, Florida, and Georgia populations, 317 respectively, the distribution within each state is uneven. In particular, the samples from 318 California are largely biased toward San Diego County, while those in Florida are more evenly 319 dispersed throughout the state. In addition, even though more than half of our tested samples 320 are from the remaining 47 U.S. states, obtaining accurate estimates of the country-wide 321 prevalence of B.1.1.7 is complicated by the historically uneven sampling of SARS-CoV-2 322 genomes across the U.S. 323We thank the employees of Helix, employees of Illumina, members of the CDC SPHERES 325 consortium and California CovidNET, and members of the Andersen Lab for discussion and 326",
