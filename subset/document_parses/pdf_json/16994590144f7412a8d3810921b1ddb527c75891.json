The purpose of the current study was to evaluate the associations between parenting stress, quality of life, and physical activity in a national sample of working mothers who endorsed having been forced to work from home full-time due to the COVID-19 pandemic and examine if physical activity moderates the association between parenting stress and quality of life in this sample of working mothers. Methods: Participants in this cross-sectional study were 200 full-time working mothers from the United States (mean age = 33.50 years; SD = 6.25; 70.0% White). Participants were recruited from a Qualtrics research panel and completed the International Physical Activity Questionnaire Short-Form, the World Health Organization Quality of Life Scale-Brief Version, the Parental Stress Scale, and a demographic questionnaire. Results: After controlling for socio-demographic variables (i.e., maternal marital status, annual income, maternal highest level of education), greater parenting stress was associated with poorer maternal quality of life across domains (standardized beta coefficients ranged from \u2212 0.26 to \u2212 0.47; p < .001). The interaction between parenting stress and moderate intensity physical activity was associated with social relationships quality of life and environment quality of life (standardized beta coefficients ranged from 0.15 to 0.17; p < .05) in our sample of working mothers. The negative effect of parenting stress on maternal social relationships and environmental quality of life was weaker for working mothers who engaged in higher levels of moderate intensity physical activity. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that moderate intensity physical activity may attenuate the negative impact of parenting stress on social relationships and satisfaction with one's environment in working mothers during the COVID-19 pandemic.",

These changes have placed increased demands on parents, particularly working mothers, who make-up 71.5% of mothers in the United States with at least one child under 18 years (United States Department of Labor, 2019), and tend to take on a disproportionate percentage of household labor, including child rearing, compared to their male partners (Chesley & Flood, 2017; Craig & Powell, 2018) . During the COVID-19 pandemic, many working mothers have been faced with trying to balance the responsibilities of working from home, being the primary caregiver of infants and toddlers who are typically in daycare, homeschooling school-aged children, and taking care of the daily needs of their families. The balancing of competing work and family responsibilities can be associated with elevated levels of stress in working mothers (Bekker et al., 2000; Zhou et al., 2018) , including increased parenting stress (i.e., stress related to managing the demands of parenting; Abidin, 1992; Forgays, 2001) .",

This is noteworthy since parental quality of life is closely related to child well-being and development (Eiser et al., 2005; Lee et al., 2009) , as well as family functioning (Pisula et al., 2017) . Interventions aimed at addressing parenting stress have largely focused on empowerment and parental skills development (Golfenshtein et al., 2016) . While these interventions have been efficacious in producing short-term reductions in parenting stress and related outcomes, overall they have failed to lead to long-term reductions in parenting stress (Golfenshtein et al., 2016) .

The purpose of the current study was to 1) evaluate the associations between parenting stress, quality of life, and physical activity in a national sample of working mothers who have transitioned to working from home due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and 2) examine if physical activity moderates the association between parenting stress and quality of life in this sample of working mothers. Based on the extant literature described above, we hypothesized that higher levels of parenting stress and lower levels of moderate and vigorous intensity physical activity would be associated with lower levels of quality of life.

The rationale for restricting the sample to mothers with at least one child 5-years-old or younger was that younger children necessitate more direct supervision; therefore, it was expected that working from home would be especially stressful for this population of mothers.

As noted above, the inclusion criteria for the present study were being a woman 18 years or older with at least one child 5years-old or younger who lives with them at least 50% of the time, working a minimum of 30 h per week, and endorsing they normally work outside of their home but have been forced to work from home fulltime due to COVID-19. Mothers who were not literate in English and were not from the United States were excluded from the study. Based on responses to the screening questions, potential participants were either exited from the survey or provided with a short description of the study and given the choice to move forward with the online consent form that provided more detailed information about the study. Potential participants who wanted to continue with the study were asked to read the consent form and provide their consent to participate in the study by checking a box on the screen. Study questionnaires were then completed by participants online through Qualtrics. Approximately 10 days after completing the questionnaires online, participants received compensation between $1.50 and $2.00 from Qualtrics online panels.

Although the present study is cross-sectional and causation can't be inferred, the results from the multiple linear regression analysis suggest that moderate intensity physical activity may be one mechanism that attenuates the association between parenting stress and diminished social relationships quality of life. Our finding suggests that encouraging more moderate intensity physical activity among working mothers may lessen the adverse impact of parenting stress on perceived social support, personal relationships, and sexual activity. This finding may be especially important for working mothers during the COVID-19 pandemic as individuals are experiencing heightened feelings of isolation and loneliness. While our study did not specifically assess the types of moderate intensity physical activity mothers engaged in, it may be beneficial for future research to assess if different types of moderate intensity physical activity differentially impact the association between parenting stress and social relationships quality of life. Encouraging working mothers to engage in a regular exercise routine with their partner or peers is one method that may facilitate meeting recommended guidelines for moderate intensity physical activity (Mailey et al., 2014) . We also found that moderate intensity physical activity attenuated the association between parenting stress and diminished environment quality of life. Thus, when working mothers in our sample engaged in greater levels of moderate intensity physical activity, the negative impact of parenting stress on satisfaction with the conditions of one's environment was less. This is noteworthy since \"shelter in place\" orders during the COVID-19 pandemic have required many people to spend a substantial amount of time in their home environment. Increased feelings of satisfaction with the conditions of one's living environment has the potential to impact family relationships and perceptions of work productivity and job satisfaction among mothers who have been forced to work home full-time. It will be valuable for future research to evaluate whether environment quality of life impacts work-related constructs like work productivity and job satisfaction in mothers who are employed from home full-time during the COVID-19 pandemic.",

These findings were not consistent with our study hypotheses. One possible explanation for these findings is the measure of quality of life we used that included items such as sore muscles, more difficulty getting around, and fatigue for the physical health domain. When working mothers did participate in moderate and vigorous intensity physical activity in the previous 7 days, it is possible it was associated with sore muscles, more difficulty getting around, and fatigue. It will be important for future studies to examine the associations between moderate and strenuous intensity physical activity and physical quality of life in working mothers using other validated measures of quality of life or health-related quality of life (e.g., SF-36). While we did not assess for barriers to moderate and vigorous intensity physical activity in our sample of working mothers, it could be useful for future research to specifically evaluate barriers and facilitators of this type of physical activity in this population during a pandemic. Guilt, scheduling constraints, a lack of support, work responsibilities, and family responsibilities have been identified as important physical activity barriers for working mothers (Mailey et al., 2014) .",

Our sample was recruited via an online data collection platform (Qualtrics panels).
