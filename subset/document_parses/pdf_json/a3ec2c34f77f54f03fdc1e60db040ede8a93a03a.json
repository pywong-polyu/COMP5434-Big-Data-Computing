This model is calibrated to reproduce several characteristics of COVID-19 transmission, accounting for its reproductive number, the length of incubation and generation periods, age-dependent attack rates, and the growth rate of cumulative incidence during a sustained and unmitigated local transmission. An important calibration outcome is the age-dependent fraction of symptomatic cases, with this fraction for children found to be one-fifth of such fraction for adults. We then apply the model to compare several intervention strategies, including restrictions on international air travel, case isolation, social distancing with varying levels of compliance, and school closures. School closures are not found to bring decisive benefits, unless coupled with high level of social distancing compliance. We report an important transition across the levels of social distancing compliance, in the range between 70% and 80% levels. This suggests that a compliance of below 70% is unlikely to succeed for any duration of social distancing, while a compliance at the 90% level is likely to control the disease within 13-14 weeks, when coupled with effective case isolation and international travel restrictions.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "The 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic is an ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID- 19) , caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).

The set of generated agents captures average characteristics of the real population, e.g., AceMod is calibrated to the Australian Census data (2016) with respect to key demographic statistics. Potential interactions between spatially distributed agents are represented using data on mobility in terms of commuting patterns (work, study and other activities), adjusted to increase precision and fidelity of commute networks [27] . Each simulation scenario runs in 12-hour cycles (\"day\" and \"night\") over the 196 days (28 weeks) of an epidemic, and agents interact across distinct social mixing groups depending on the cycle, for example, in working groups and/or classrooms during a \"day\" cycle, and their households, household 2 clusters, and local communities during the \"night\" cycle. The interactions result in transmission of the disease from infectious to susceptible individuals: given the contact and transmission rates, the simulation computes and updates agents' states over time, starting from initial infections, seeded in international airports around Australia [14, 15] . Simulating disease transmission in AceMod requires both (i) specifics of local transmission dynamics, dependent on individual health characteristics of the agents, such as susceptibility and immunity to disease, driven by their transmission and contact rates across different social contexts; and (ii) a natural disease history model for COVID-19, i.e., the infectivity profile from the onset of infection, over an incubation period, to the peak of infectivity, to recovery, for a single symptomatic or asymptomatic individual.
