Interestingly, FMD did not change when this same set of RE was performed at a high intensity [22] , which may indicate an inverse relationship between FMD changes in response to RE as well as to exercise intensity. Our research group has recently reported that a single session of aerobic exercise (AE), lower-limb RE, and CE (AE + RE) at moderate intensity for 40 min did not result in brachial artery FMD changes in hypertensive individuals when measured 10, 40, and 70 min after exercise [23] . In addition, the levels of endothelial microvesicles and substances associated with oxidative stress remained unchanged [23] . Altogether, we can raise the hypothesis that other factors may play a role including exacerbated sympathetic activation in untrained limbs, which may cause vasoconstriction and redirection of blood flow to trained limbs [24, 25] , thus potentially competing with the endothelium-dependent vasodilator effect [26] .",

In a quiet, dark room with controlled temperature (23-24\u00b0C) at the study site, a qualified evaluator blinded to the intervention condition simultaneously measures blood flow velocity and baseline brachial artery diameter on the volunteer's right arm. With the volunteer in supine position, arm extended and across the trunk at an angle of~40\u00b0after a 10-15-min rest, measurements of baseline BP (left arm), resting HR, blood flow velocity, and brachial artery diameter are For the assessment of FMD of the brachial artery, the volunteers are asked to come to the study site after 6-h fasting except for anti-hypertensive medication. A rapid deflation cuff (Incoterm\u2122 EC500; Porto Alegre, Brazil) is placed around the forearm 5 cm distal to the antecubital fossa, and B-mode artery images are obtained at the distal third of the arm with a linear multi-frequency transducer (12 MHz) connected to a high-resolution Doppler ultrasound system (Esaote MyLab\u2122 70 XVision; Genoa, Italy). The positions of the ultrasound probe and the cuff are marked on the skin so that they can be reproduced during the study. The position of the arm is photographed and the distance between the transducer and the antecubital fossa is measured so that the same can be reproduced in the second exercise session. The evaluator aligns the cursor of the sample volume to the width of the artery at an insonation angle of 60\u00b0. Baseline diameters are recorded for 1 min and the forearm cuff is inflated to 50 mmHg above systolic blood pressure (SBP) for 5 min. Images are recorded 30 s before cuff deflation and for 3 min after cuff deflation. Real-time Doppler ultrasound images are recorded and stored into a USB video card (Dazzle; Taiwan) for offline data analysis. To minimize bias blood flow velocity and brachial artery diameter are evaluated via an edge-detection and wall-tracking software program (CardiovasculareSuit\u2122; Pisa, Italy). From this synchronized brachial artery diameter and blood flow velocity data, blood flow (the product of lumen cross-sectional area and Doppler velocity) is calculated at 30 Hz. Forearm peripheral vascular resistance is determined as mean BP divided by blood flow. FMD is calculated as the percentage change in peak diameter after cuff deflation from baseline. Time to peak diameter is calculated from the point of cuff deflation to peak artery diameter [39] . The shear rate is calculated (4 \u00d7 mean blood velocity/artery diameter) as the area under the curve between the point of deflation and maximal dilation [12] .",

All heartbeats are identified through a specialized algorithm using MAT-LAB MT (MATLAB 6.0, Mathworks, USA) with automatic detection of systolic and diastolic pressure wave events. Pulse intervals (PIs) are calculated as the difference between start and end points of the cycle (PI = time point 1 \u2212 time point 0). For the time-domain analysis of HRV and BPV data, such as spectrum composition (fast Fourier transform), the CardioSeries\u00ae software program is used (www. danielpenteado.com/cardioseries). This analysis requires the removal of transient and discrepant elements and interpolation of consecutive fragments of a time series. The following spectral frequencies are evaluated: very low frequency (VLF, 0.007-0.04 Hz); low frequency (LF, 0.04-0.15 Hz); high frequency (HF, 0.15-0.4 Hz); and total power (TP, VLF + LF + HF).
