While other pre-admission comorbidities (e.g., arterial hypertension) were more Open Access common than DM, chronic dysglycemia as defined by an HbA1c \u2265 5.7% was the predominant factor in our cohort of critically ill COVID-19 patients. We still did not find a strong association between elevated HbA1c and ICU/ hospital mortality, but in the subgroup of patients requiring mechanical ventilation, mortality was significantly increased in patients with HbA1c \u2265 6.5%. This is in line with other cohorts of COVID-19 patients, showing that admission blood glucose may be a more relevant predictor for mortality than HbA1c [3] . Admission blood glucose may be interpreted as a biomarker of systemic inflammation on admission, whereas HbA1c represents a marker of glucose control of the past three months [4, 5] . Unfortunately, blood glucose measurements during ICU admission were not recorded in our registry. Furthermore, follow-up of reported patients would be necessary to confirm diagnosis of previously unrecognized diabetes mellitus by admission HbA1c. We also have to acknowledge a potential selection bias for patients in whom HbA1c was measured. BMI has recently been reported as an important risk factor for severe COVID-19 [3] . Though we could establish a weak correlation between BMI and HbA1c, we want to emphasize that prediabetes/and diabetes may exist independently and thus remain an independent risk factor for ICU admission in COVID-19. A possible explanation may be a pathological inflammatory response in diabetic patients [6] . When exposed to an additional inflammatory stimulus, such as mechanical ventilation on top of COVID-19, outcome may be impaired. This finding warrants further research in terms of risk stratification at ICU admission.",
