The Pfizer-BioNTech was the only formulation of a mRNA COVID-19 vaccine 76 available at VUMC at the time. In collaboration between the Division of Allergy and the 77 Occupational Health Clinic at VUMC, a screening algorithm for stratification of mRNA 78 COVID-19 vaccine risk was developed using CDC and expert guidance 6,7 (Figure 1) 79 and employed at the time of Occupational Health vaccination appointments. Individuals 80 with a history of anaphylaxis to an injectable medication, vaccine, oral PEG3350, or 81 unknown cause (idiopathic) triggered a focused review of the implicated cause by the 82 Allergist On-Call by telephone. If the implicated drug in a previous potentially allergic 83 reaction did not contain PEG or polysorbate, individuals were recommended to proceed 84 to vaccination with a 30-minute observation. If the implicated drug likely contained PEG 85 or polysorbate or the cause unknown, subsequent tolerance of PEG or polysorbate 86 containing medications was questioned. If subsequent tolerance of PEG or polysorbate 87 was known, individuals were recommended to proceed to vaccination with a 30-minute 88 observation. If subsequent tolerance of PEG or polysorbate was not known, individuals 89 did not proceed to vaccination and were referred to the Drug Allergy Clinic for 90 assessment prior to immunization. Calls were logged in REDCap (Research Electronic 91 Database Capture) hosted at VUMC at the time of the focused review by the Allergist 92 J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f On-Call. 8 Demographics (age, sex), anaphylaxis history, subsequent tolerance of PEG 93 and polysorbate if applicable, and dose one recommendation were recorded. 94 Additionally, the Occupational Health Clinic utilized a REDCap project to capture 95 individuals who reported an adverse reaction to the Pfizer-BioNTech mRNA COVID-19 96 vaccine. Those who reported a suspected allergy-related adverse reaction to dose one 97 administration were referred by Occupational Health to the Drug Allergy Clinic. All 98 charts were subsequently reviewed for the outcomes of dose one administration, 99 including if a referral was placed before receipt of dose one or after dose one for an 100 adverse reaction. In those who were referred to the Drug Allergy Clinic, PEG and 101 polysorbate skin testing results, by previously reported protocols 3 , if applicable, and 102 recommendation on proceeding to dose one were also reviewed. 103 104 Of 23,035 individuals screened prior to dose one of the Pfizer-BioNTech mRNA COVID-105 19 vaccine, 31 reported a high-risk allergy history that triggered a focused review by the 106 Allergist On-Call (Figure 2). The implicated causes included 14 injectable medication 107 anaphylaxis, 9 idiopathic anaphylaxis, 8 vaccine anaphylaxis and 0 oral PEG3350 108",

            "text": "). Of the 3 individuals recommended to not proceed to dose one and referred to the 115 J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Drug Allergy Clinic for assessment, 1 referral was for vaccine anaphylaxis possibly 116 containing polysorbate and unknown subsequent tolerance of PEG and polysorbate; 117 and 2 referrals were for idiopathic anaphylaxis with unknown subsequent tolerance of 118 PEG or polysorbate. Of the 28 high-risk allergy history workforce members who 119 proceeded to the first dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 mRNA vaccine, none 120 were later referred by Occupational Health for evaluation of a dose one adverse 121 reaction (Figure 2). Of the 3 individuals referred to the Drug Allergy Clinic prior to 122 receipt of dose one, the 2 patients with history of idiopathic anaphylaxis were 123 determined not to be high-risk upon formal consultation (1 had actually tolerated oral 124 PEG3350 and 1 had an attributable cause of medication-induced anaphylaxis). Neither 125 individual underwent PEG and polysorbate skin testing and both proceeded to tolerate 126 dose one at an Occupational Health site. The third individual referred to the Drug 127 Allergy Clinic prior to receipt of dose one had a history of vaccine anaphylaxis and 128 underwent PEG and polysorbate skin testing and oral PEG3350 challenge, both of 129 which were negative. This individual then went on to receive and tolerate their first dose 130 in the Drug Allergy Clinic. Of the 23,004 workforce members with low or moderate risk 131 allergy history who proceeded to dose one vaccination, 13 were referred to the Drug 132 Allergy Clinic for evaluation of dose one adverse reactions (Figure 2), none of whom 133 had a previous history of reaction to a PEG or polysorbate containing drug. 134 135 In the experience of a single, large academic hospital employee vaccination program, 136 0.1% (31/23,035) of workforce members reported a high-risk allergy history that 137 triggered a focused review by the Allergist On-Call (Figure 2). Of those with a high-risk 138 J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f allergy history, 90% (28/31) were able to proceed to dose one due to lack of PEG or 139 polysorbate in the implicated cause and/or known subsequent tolerance of PEG or 140 polysorbate containing medications or vaccines. None of the 28 individuals with high-141 risk allergy history who proceeded to dose one experienced a dose one adverse 142 reaction that necessitated referral to the Drug Allergy Clinic by Occupational Health. Of 143 the 3 high-risk individuals referred to the Drug Allergy Clinic for further risk assessment 144 prior to dose one, all 3 ultimately received and tolerated dose one uneventfully. Of the 145 13 referrals to the Drug Allergy Clinic for evaluation of dose one adverse reactions, all 146 were from individuals with low or moderate risk allergy history. The overall referral rate 147 to the Drug Allergy Clinic for dose one adverse reactions was 0.06% (13/23,035) of 148 workforce members. Of particular note, there were no new diagnoses of PEG allergy 149 during this study period. 150 151 A limitation of our study is that it is retrospective and may underrepresent the number of 152 individuals with a high-risk allergy history due to complexity of history reporting and 153 vaccination sites interpreting possible history of anaphylaxis in real-time. It is also 154 possible that those with highest risk allergy histories were more hesitant and declined 155 COVID-19 vaccination during this initial rollout period. Further, referrals to the Drug 156 Allergy Clinic by Occupational Health may underrepresent the number of individuals 157 who experienced dose one adverse reactions, as some may choose to defer second 158 dose vaccination themselves without reporting their reaction to Occupational Health for 159 further assessment. Prospective studies of potentially allergic reactions to the first dose 160 of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines where there has been full ascertainment of symptoms 161 showed rates of approximately 2% in HCW 9 , which is significantly higher than our 162 0.06% of individuals later referred to the Drug Allergy Clinic after dose one adverse 163 reactions. 164 165 This is the first study that reports on the outcomes and utility of screening mRNA 166 COVID-19 vaccine risk by allergy history. We show that only 0.1% of individuals report 167 a high-risk allergy and that none of the high-risk allergy workforce members required 168 referral to the Drug Allergy Clinic for first dose adverse reactions. Rather, all referrals to 169 the Drug Allergy Clinic were from individuals with low or moderate risk allergy history. 170 Overall, only 3/23,035 (0.01%) of individuals were excluded from vaccination based on 171 prior allergy history at time of presentation to the Occupational Health vaccine clinics. 172 There are no other reports on exclusion rates at time of presentation for COVID-19 173 vaccination based on allergy history and likely are to be higher where on-call Allergy 174 specialists are not available. The complexity of current screening algorithms may be 175 causing unwarranted perception of risk and hesitancy towards mRNA COVID-19 176 vaccination without effectiveness in promoting their safety. Therefore, it may now be 177 possible to revise mRNA COVID-19 vaccination to more targeted criteria, similar to 178 other vaccines, such as: 1) history of anaphylaxis to a prior mRNA COVID-19 vaccine 179 and 2) history of known prior PEG allergy? 180 181",
