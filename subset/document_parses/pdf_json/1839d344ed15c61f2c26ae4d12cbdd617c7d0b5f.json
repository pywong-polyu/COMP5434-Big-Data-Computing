Alternatively, increased CTLA-4 expression in T reg cells in this context may primarily indicate that higher levels of T reg activation are present under conditions that also lead to shorter CDR-H3s. Transient modulation of immune checkpoints such as the CTLA-4 pathway during HIV vaccination has been proposed as a new approach to enable HIV-infected individuals to generate bNAbs.

A major topic of current study is the way that differences in the HIV viral populations, such as the diversity, concentrations or epitope features of viral subpopulations, may affect the B cell phenotypes we observe. HIV-infected individuals produce characteristic 'convergent' clones with highly similar sequences detected in two or more individuals that are rarely detected in healthy people. These convergent clones indicate whether an individual is infected by HIV, although we have not determined whether all such clones are specific to HIV. We also find other clones that more weakly classify an individual's HIV neutralizing breadth. The accuracy of bNAb classification is enhanced in models that incorporate additional repertoire characteristics, but convergent clones alone are sufficient to predict HIV infection status accurately.

A second PCR step with primers listed inSupplementary Table 5 was used to add the remaining portion of the Illumina linkers to the amplicons and was carried out with theQiagen Multiplex PCR kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions, using 0.4 \u03bcl of the first PCR product as template in a 30-\u03bcl reaction. The PCR program for the second PCR step was 94 \u00b0C for 15 min, 12 cycles of (94 \u00b0C for 30 s, 60 \u00b0C for 45 s and 72 \u00b0C for 90 s) and final extension at 72 \u00b0C for 10 min.

High-throughput sequencing was performed with an Illumina MiSeq instrument using 600-cycle sequencing kits.PCR amplification of gDNA IGH libraries and sequencing. For gDNAtemplated libraries, PCR reactions were prepared from 100 ng gDNA aliquots to generate three independent libraries per sample. Multiplexed primers to the IGHJ (SupplementaryTable 3) and FR1 or FR2 framework regions, as per the BIOMED-2 design (SupplementaryTable 4), were used, with additional sequence representing the first half of the Illumina linkers22,33 . Eight-nucleotide barcode sequences were included in the primers to indicate sample and replicate identity and four randomized bases were included upstream of the barcodes on the IGHJ primer for Illumina clustering. PCR was performed with AmpliTaq Gold polymerase as per the manufacturer's instructions. The PCR program was as follows: 94 \u00b0C for 5 min, 35 cycles of (94 \u00b0C for 30 s, 60 \u00b0C for 45 s and 72 \u00b0C for 90 s) and final extension at 72 \u00b0C for 10 min.
