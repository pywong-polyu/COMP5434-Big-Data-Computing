COVID-19 can cause a wide range of clinical symptoms, which varies from asymptomatic presentation to severe respiratory insufficiency, exacerbation of immune response, disseminated microthrombosis and multiple organ failure, which may lead to dead. Due to the rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2, the development of vaccines to minimize COVID-19 severity in the world population is imperious. One of the employed techniques to produce vaccines against emerging viruses is the synthesis of recombinant proteins, which can be used as immunizing agents. Based on the exposed, the aim of the present study was to verify the systemic and immunological effects of IM administration of recombinant Nucleocapsid protein (NP), derived from SARS-CoV-2 and produced by this research group, in 2 different strains of rats (Rattus norvegicus); Wistar and Lewis.",

Our results showed that NP inoculations were safe for the animals, which presented no clinical symptoms of worrying side effects, nor laboratorial alterations in the main biochemical and histological parameters, suggesting the absence of toxicity induced by NP. Moreover, NP injections successfully triggered the production of specific anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies by both Wistar and Lewis rats, showing the sensitization to have been well sufficient for the immunization of these strains of rats. Additionally, we observed the local lung activation of the Bronchus-Associated Lymphoid Tissue (BALT) of rats in the NP groups, suggesting that NP elicits specific lung immune response. Although pre-clinical and clinical studies are still required, our data support the recombinant NP produced by this research group as a potential immunizing agent for massive vaccination, and may represent advantages upon other recombinant proteins, since it seems to induce specific pulmonary protection.",

In addition to the classic respiratory syndrome, other clinical and laboratory features, such as changes in the activation of blood coagulation pathways, were observed in COVID-19 patients, who may present fibrin deposition and disseminated microthrombosis, including in the nervous central system (NCS) and in the urinary system [6, 7] . The pathophysiological mechanisms that determine the severity of COVID-19 manifestations are still unclear, and may depend on genetic susceptibility, pre-existing conditions; such as diabetes, hypertension and obesity, and individual general health. Main articles and case reports published to date, show the presence of at least two distinct phases in the evolution of COVID-19 pathology; The first, directly triggered by the viral infection, and the second, more severe and generally correlated with a worse prognosis for the patient, promoted by the exacerbated immune response of the host organism, a life-threatening systemic inflammatory syndrome known as \"Cytokine Storm\" [8, 9] .",

SARS-CoV-2 is a ssRNA-virus, externally protected by a spherical-shaped phospholipid envelope of about 125 nm of diameter, covered by glycosylated Spike proteins (SP), which are the responsible for chemical affinity of the virus to the mammalian cells. SARS-CoV-2 binds the host cell through the interaction between its S protein and the transmembrane isoform of the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) of host cells, that serves as a receptor, mediating viral entry. The SARS-COV-2 genome consists of approximately 30,000 nucleotides, which encode the structural viral proteins; S, Envelope protein (EP), Membrane protein (MP) and Nucleocapsid protein (NP), associated with protein units of NP, which in turn regulates viral replication replication [11] . SARS-CoV-2 seems to be less lethal than the SARS-CoV or the MERS-CoV, but more infectious, which could be contribute to its pandemic potential [12] .",

Such elements stimulate both cellular and humoral adaptive immune response of the host, triggering the synthesis of specific antibodies against the pathogen, thus preparing it for future infections. Immunization through the vaccines is one of the most effective strategies for the prevention of infectious disease, and have being applied very successfully over the last decades, since it protects not only the patient who receives the immunizing agent, but the whole community, as the immunized person is unlike to become a vector of transmission to other people.

As can be seen, a positive correlation between antibody production and immunohistochemistry in lung tissue stained with HE is observed mainly for Lewis rats with a correlation coefficient (r) of 0. Currently, the global efforts are concentrated on massive COVID-19 immunization, through both the distribution of the present vaccines for as many people all over the world, and through the stimulus to the local production of different immunizing agents in as many countries it is possible [11, 22] . In this context, the present study aimed to As widely known, once a superior organism is exposed to invading microorganisms, such as viruses or bacteria, small parts of the pathogen stimulates the B-cells of the host, which in turn, differentiate into plasmocytes and start producing specific antibodies. In a very simplified way, antibodies are proteins able to recognizing and bind to known invading microorganisms, promoting both its neutralization or the opsonization of its phagocytosis by macrophages and neutrophils of the innate immune system of the host.",

            "text": "Therefore, once an animal is sensitized to a particular pathogen, the response of its immune system in a future infection (reinfection with the same pathogen) will be faster and more effective, thus preventing the development of a more severe presentation of the disease [22, 23] . In order to evaluate the efficiency of NP to activate the immune response of inoculated animals, we analyzed the presence of specific anti-SARS-CoV2 IgG antibodies in the sera of NP-injected and non-injected rats, using WB. As expected, only sera from animals of the NP groups (both Wistar and Lewis strains) exhibited positivity for anti-SARS-CoV2 class G antibodies, therefore; it seems correct to state that the inoculation with recombinant NP in this experimental protocol succeeded in promoting the sensitization of the animals, with consequent synthesis of specific antibodies able of recognizing SARS-CoV2. Our results suggest the potential use of the recombinant NP described here, as both an immunizing agent and a useful tool for the production of rapid indirect diagnostic tests for SARS-CoV2, since WB strips containing this immobilized protein could be used to recognize sera from patients that have already been exposed to the virus, or have already had COVID-19 vaccine, and therefore would have specific strand-sensitive IgGs. In accordance with our findings, recent studies of Smits and collaborators comparing the specificity of IgG antibody response against SARS-CoV-2 demonstrated that, most of the COVID-19 patients exhibited specific immune response against NP, while few or none immunoreactivity against SP or MP have been found [25] . It is of note that the lower respiratory tract of mammals is constantly exposed to multiple airborne pathogens, and a prompt and effective immune response against such inhaled invaders is crucial for the survival of species [26, PABST 2010] . In this context, during the evolutionary process, a mucosal secondary lymphoid tissue, embedded in the walls of the large airways, the Bronchus-Associated Lymphoid Tissue (BALT) became part of the immune defense arsenal of many mammals. BALT is constitutive during all life phases in some species, including rats and rabbits, but it is absent in healthy adult mice and humans [Sminia et al., 1989 , Troy D. Randall 2010] . Although more studies with different species, more similar to the human beings, regarding the specific pulmonary immune response are still required, we can suppose that, interestingly, the IM immunization with recombinant NP was able to activate the BALT of the rats, as a response of the systemic immune response triggered by the immunization, reflecting in the overactivity of immune cells observed in the lung of NP rats. Our findings suggest that, in spite of the IM administration, our immunizing agent was able to trigger an immune response specifically in the lungs of the injected rats. This is clinically relevant: the immunomodulation being a primary mechanism underlying COVID-19 supports the prioritization of tolerance as a vaccine strategy.",

Additionally, NP inoculation successfully promoted the production of specific IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV2, indicating its potential use for massive vaccination immunization, especially because it seems to induce specific pulmonary protection, although additional studies are still needed.

Animals and Experimental Protocol All experimental procedures employed in the present study were approved by the Research Ethics Committee for the Use of Experimental Animals of the University of S\u00e3o Paulo Medical School (CEUA FMUSP N\u00ba 1522/2020). Adult male rats from Wistar and Lewis strains, weighing 250-300 g, were obtained from an established colony at the University of S\u00e3o Paulo. Animals were maintained at a constant temperature of 23\u00b11\u00b0C, under a 12-12h light/dark cycle and had free access to tap water and conventional rodent chow. Ten Wistar and 7 Lewis rats were subjected to intramuscular (IM) injections of 100\u00b5L of recombinant SARS-CoV-2 Nucleocapsid Protein (NP) diluted at 1,5 \u00b5g/\u00b5L in protein buffer, weekly, during 4 consecutive weeks: Groups Wistar NP and Lewis NP, respectively. Additional 5 Wistar and 5 Lewis animals received IM injections of 100\u00b5L of protein buffer (50 mM MOPS pH 7.0, 50 mM sodium chloride and 1mM EDTA) and were followed up during the same period, being used as control (Wistar Control / Lewis Control).",

Immunohistochemistry of Lung Samples Immunohistochemistry (IHC) for detection of macrophages (CD68+) and T-lymphocytes (CD3+) was performed in 4-\u03bcm-thick lung sections of each studied animal, in order to confirm and characterize the hypercellularity observed in the histological analyses. Specific immunostaining for macrophages was obtained by means of a streptavidinbiotin-alkaline-phosphatase IHC technique, using a primary monoclonal mouse anti-rat ED1 antibody (Serotec, #MCA341R, Oxford, UK), followed by a secondary biotinylated horse anti-mouse IgG antibody, rat adsorbed (Vector #BA2001, California, USA). CD68+ cells were developed in red, with a fast-red dye solution, and counterstained with Mayer's haemalum (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany). For T-lymphocytes identification, immunoperoxidase staining was performed. The specific primary antibody polyclonal rabbit anti-human CD3 (Dako, #A4052, California, USA) was used, followed by polyclonal goat anti-rabbit IgG + HRP polymer (Spring Laboratories, #DHRR, California, USA). CD3+ cells were developed in brown, with a DAB dye solution.Immunostained cells were quantified by histomorphometry. To access uniform and proportional lung samples, 10 fields (five non-overlapping fields in two different sections) were randomly analyzed in proximal and distal lung parenchyma. The measurements were done with a 100-point and 50 straight grid with a known area (103 \u03bcm 2 at a 400x magnification) attached to the ocular of the microscope[17]. At 400x magnification, the number of positive immunostained cells in each field was calculated according to the number of points hitting positive cells for specific antibody as a proportion of the total grid area. Bronchi and blood vessels were carefully avoided during the measurements. In order to normalize the data, the number of positive cells, measured in each field, was divided by the length of each septum studied (to avoid any bias secondary to septal edema, alveolar collapse and denser tissue matrix seen in the fibrotic sections). The results were expressed as the number of positive cells/mm 2 of connective tissue.",

Moreover, in order to further evaluate the hepatic metabolism of lipids in the animals submitted to NP injections, we analyzed plasma TC (E), cholesterol fractions (F), TG (G), and triglyceride fractions (H), which were all very similar among Control and NP animals of each studied strain. Finally, histological analysis of HE-stained liver sections, illustrated in Figure 1(I), showed no structural abnormalities in the hepatic architecture of both Wistar and Lewis NP animals, compared to their respective controls.There was also not observed any impact of IM injections of NP on the renal function of both Wistar and Lewis strains of rats. As can be seen inFigure 2, NP animals exhibited regular urinary flow (A), according to their lineage, did not presented proteinuria (B), nor Screat (C) or BUN (D) retention. Accordingly, no histological changes were observed in the renal parenchyma of animals submitted to NP injections, compared to their strainmatched controls, as illustrated inFigure 2(E).Additional biomarkers of inflammation and overactivity of the coagulation system, usually correlated with worse prognosis in human patients infected by SARS-CoV-2, where also studied in NP animals. As shown inTable 2, both Wistar and Lewis rats receiving IM injections of NP exhibited regular values of serum CRP, Tnl and D-dimer, compared to Control animals. NP injection induced specific immune response in both Wistar and Lewis rats, thus promoting the synthesis of specific antibodies The presence of specific anti-SARS-CoV2 IgG in the serum of animals submitted to NP injections was evaluated by WB, as illustrated in Figure 3A. Each number at X axis of the barghraph represents one of the experimental animals. Positive dark bands at the point on the WB strip correspondent to the NP molecular weight (45KDa) indicate the positivity of serum sample for specific anti-NP IgG, which was evident in all NP Lewis animals, and in at least 5 of the 7 Wistar NP rats, indicating that the serum of these animals contained high levels of specific IgG anti-SARS-CoV2. Additionally, although the serum of the remaining 2 Wistar animals (rats 22 and 24) sensitized with NP showed only weak positivity when observed by naked eyes, it presented detectable positivity when analyzed with the Image Lab software (Bio-Rad), as can be seen in the correspondent bars above of each WB band photograph. Accordingly, none of the sera from Control Wistar or Lewis animals exhibited positive WB bands, indicating the absence of detectable anti-SARS-CoV2 antibodies in these groups, in spite of the similar concentrations of total serum globulins in NP animals compared to their strain-matched controls (Figure 3B). This observation becomes even more evident when WB band densities were statistically analyzed, as shown in Figure 3C. As observed in the respective bargraph, both Wistar and Lewis animals sensitized with the recombinant NP exhibited significantly high levels of anti-SARS-CoV2 IgG, compared to the Control groups, in which there were no crossreactivity. NP IM injections induced the activation of the Bronchus-Associated Lymphoid Tissue (BALT) in both Wistar and Lewis rats Histological analysis of lung tissue from NP and Control Wistar and Lewis rats were performed in HE-stained sections, by an experienced pathologist. As demonstrated in the lung parenchyma of Control rats (A, C) presented preserved appearance, regular alveolar septa and vessels. On the other hand, the lung of animals submitted to NP inoculation (B, D) exhibited altered pulmonary histoarchitecture, alveolar septa thickening and cellular infiltrate (arrows), which could be better seen under higher magnification in J and L. Moreover, NP animals also exhibited follicular bronchiolitis (F, H) accompanied by lymphocytic infiltrate (arrows), compared to its strain-matched controls. A bargraph representation of the score of inflammatory cells observed in the lung of NP and Control animals of each strain can be seen in Figure 4U. According to our results, both Wistar and Lewis NP animals exhibited significant increased lung cell infiltration, compared to Control groups. Further immunohistochemistry analysis was performed to better characterize the inflammatory cells infiltrating the lung tissue of the experimental animals. Pinkish-red points in the illustrative microphotographs of pulmonary tissue, shown in Figure 4 M-P are CD68+ macrophages. As can be noticed, Both Wistar and Lewis NP rats exhibited increased lung macrophage infiltration, compared to its strain-matched controls, however, only in Lewis NP animals this difference was statistically significant (Figure 4V). Conversely, brown points in the illustrative microphotographs of pulmonary tissue, shown in Figure 4 Q-T are CD3+ Tcells. Once more, Lewis NP rats exhibited increased lung lymphocyte infiltration,",

Additionally, we sought to verify the safety of NP as a potential immunizing agent, through the analyzes of the systemic effects of NP application on experimental animals. No mortality, nor general behavioral alterations, inappetence or pain sings were observed in the animals of the different groups included in the present study. Vaccines usually produce only subtle clinical side effects, such as local pain due to the infiltration of inflammatory cells at the administration site, and slight fever, reflecting the expected immunological response of the host to the vaccine, similarly to what occurs after a natural infection These symptoms derive from the release of proinflammatory mediators such as the CRP, interleukins and coagulation factors, and are intrinsic of the activation of immune response [24]. Although vaccines are rarely related to systemic and local toxicity, due to the small amount of biological material which is injected for immunization, general health tests are mandatory when developing a new drug or treatment aimed for future clinical application. Accordingly, here we demonstrated that NP injections did not cause biochemical or histopathological changes which may suggest hepatotoxicity (increased concentration of liver enzymes, body weight loss, decreased serum protein concentration, dyslipidemia), or nephrotoxicity (polyuria/oliguria, proteinuria, increased Screat and BUN concentrations), and did not increased the main serum biomarkers of inflammation: CRP, TnI or D-dimer, thus providing satisfactory evidence that NP was safe for rats, exhibiting no toxic effects at the dose and route of administration tested in the experimental animals of this study.",

Areas of multifocal expansion, as well as increased number of mononuclear cells, mainly lymphocytes, and macrophages, were noticed in the lungs of Wistar rats and, specially, in those from Lewis animals. Our histological and immunohistochemical analysis revealed that the greatest increase in lung infiltrating cells was predominantly within parenchymal regions rather than vascular areas and that it was mostly composed by macrophages and lymphocytes. Here, we report for the first time results describing pulmonary immune responses induced by the intramuscular injection of a recombinant SARS-CoV-2 protein. Our experimental findings provide data for further studies to better understand the effects of immunization against SARS-CoV-2, specifically on the lung parenchyma, since it is only possible with the use of laboratory animals. However, one of the limitations of using experimental animals are the inherent difficulties due to anatomic and physiological differences between other mammalian species and the human beings.",
