And yet the WTO still does not provide a coherent food policy and the 2021 UN Food Systems Summit made very little space for trade policy. The degree of international trade policy discord and supply chain fragility strongly suggests that there must be new international trade negotiations around fundamental questions of principle. Seeing little benefit in reforming the WTO, this article explains how the trade agenda for the right to food could focus on territorial markets and negotiating new types of treaties, International Food Agreements.",

Sustainable intensification in many ways tries to better align with ecological goals such as soil health and increased biodiversity. Nevertheless, its methods are proving to be more a reform of industrial agriculture than a transformation of a food system (Kuyper and Struik 2014; Loos et al. 2014 ). Both sustainable intensification and industrial intensification rely on capital-intensive processes and technologies, thus reflecting the status quo of the current global political economy of the food system. Both frame the problem primarily in terms of production, farm size, and scale of operation. Both rely on a theory of knowledge in which, for the most part, scientists and experts deliver knowledge to farmers.",

Nevertheless, the Summit failed to capture human rights. It is clear to most people who participated in the Summit who were committed to human rights that the Summit used human rights language cynically. The Secretary-General, the Deputy Secretary-General, and the Summit Secretariat never substantively responded to the number of human rights concerns that were independently raised by different parties. The response was always that human rights were important and everyone is welcome to participate. This was a superficial definition of participation that gave people the space to speak within the Summit process but not the power to affect the Summit. Because of mass popular mobilizations, however, the meaning of human rights remained in the hands of the people.",

Businesses are having to quickly adapt to global supply chain disruptions. One of the most popular demands from local governments, social movements, advocacy groups, experts and some national governments is a call to promote local food production, short supply chains and a greater degree of self-sufficiency. 4 Even before the pandemic, long supply chains were losing popularity. Agrifood companies had been sourcing their ingredients from a large number of different places. They knew how to leverage low tariffs and rely on buying goods from the cheapest source. Corporations were also often reluctant to ask too many questions about where they primary goods derived from. Global value chains were increasingly being criticized for being 'too long' because it made it more difficult to hold the ultimate purchasing business accountable for human rights violations at different points of the chain. Due to the increased number of lawsuits and public attention, corporations are exploring new options. Today, for example, chocolate companies like Mars and Ferrero are now looking to create shorter supply chains. This is unlikely to solve anything in and of itself, however, since it will likely only move environmental issues from abroad to the corporation's home country. 5 In fact, one can imagine a shorter supply chain making it easier for large companies to grab land or consolidate more of their market power.",

It has instead protected powerful countries and allowed those governments to use public agricultural funds to subsidize large transnational corporations (H\u00e4berli 2016; Fakhri 2020).",

Today, we are at a point where there is no longer a global consensus around agricultural subsidies and government support more broadly. Member States are in serious conflict over what public policies count as market distortions and which are the preconditions for a fair and stable market.

By the late 1980s, many developing countries were exportoriented and did little to support domestic agricultural production (Dean 1995) . What the Agreement of Agriculture did was re-new the international protections granted to the US and to (what was then) the European Economic Commission (EEC) under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT)-in effect legitimizing the European and US systems of subsidies. The global understanding was that eventually the European and US governments would reduce their subsidies and allow food and agricultural products to come in from what were former colonies. In return, developing countries agreed to TRIPS which extended intellectual property rights in effect for Global North companies looking to expand to the Global South. 8 That bargain never materialized. 9 Though the Agreement on Agriculture included mechanisms to encourage the European and US governments to reduce their subsidies, in practice the Agreement was flexible in a way that has mostly supported countries with industrialized agricultural sectors and significant import rates like the EU and US.",

Food is produced, processed, sold or distributed, and consumed within a given territory. The gap between producers and end users is narrowed; and the length of the distribution chain is significantly shortened or even direct. This can be contrasted to food systems that are at the mercy of global markets, food that is the result of opaque global value chains, or processed foods that are sourced from a variety of places. \u2022 Diverse Territorial markets are inclusive and diversified with a wide variety of agricultural and local food products to the marketplace, reflecting the diversity of the food system(s) of the territory. \u2022 Holistic Territorial markets perform multiple economic, social, cultural and ecological functions within their given territories-starting with but not limited to food provision. \u2022 Remunerative Territorial markets are the most profitable for smallholders since such markets provide farmers with more control over conditions of access and prices than mainstream value chains and more autonomy in negotiating them. \u2022 Circular Territorial markets contribute to structuring the territorial economy since they enable a greater share of the wealth created to be retained and redistributed within the territory. \u2022 Legal Territorial markets may be informal, formal, or somewhere in between. Informal means not taxed or licensed, it does not mean illegal. Being more formal does not necessarily suggest that a market is better functioning. To varying degrees, all have some links with the relevant public bodies and the state through tax collection or through public investments. \u2022 Embedded Territorial markets include embedded governance systems meaning that they operate according to a set of commonly shared rules that are negotiated between producers, consumers and the different authorities of the territory concerned (what some also call 'nested markets'). \u2022 Solidaristic In addition to serving as spaces in which buyers and sellers are matched up, territorial markets are places where political, social and cultural relations are made and expressed, and where all people involved interact according to varying degrees of interdependence and solidarity. The power relationship amongst producers, processors, traders and consumers is more horizontal. This means that markets are constituted by long-standing relationships of trust.",

For research purposes, it may be useful to understand how food systems and territories are made through movement especially if one element of territorial markets is to circulate wealth. All food systems generate movement, and human and non-human animals are constantly migrating (Marris 2020) . In fact, people often build their cultures and food systems around the seasons, tidal shifts, and movements of a particular species through space and time. Pastoralists, fishers, and some Indigenous people's sense of their home territory is bounded by the movement of the animals they depend on. Moreover, human migration is often the result of power disparity (Achiume 2019). With climate change, people, non-human animals, and entire biomes are migrating at unprecedented rates (Shah 2020) . This means that territories are quickly changing in scale, nature, and size. This also means migrant workers are some of the most vulnerable to sickness and death in the pandemic. It is helpful to map territorial markets as they are. 14 It would be more productive to also have a better understanding of how new territories are being remade in real time.",
