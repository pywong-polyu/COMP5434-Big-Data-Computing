On March 11, 2020 , the World Health Organization has officially characterized COVID-19 as a pandemic. By the end of January 2021, the number of people diagnosed worldwide with COVID-19 crossed the 100 million mark [29] , which has put a tremendous strain on scarce hospital capacities. Specifically, the pandemic places a load on clinical bed capacity, and in particular on Intensive Care Units (ICU's), that is well beyond the currently available bed capacities [4, 5] . The catastrophic situation in Lombardy, Italy, mid-March 2020 has tragically shown the impact of the lack of health capacities [24] , and the need to manage hospital bed capacities as good as possible. In [22] , the authors call upon ICU practitioners, hospital administrators, governments, and policy makers to be prepared early for a substantial increase in critical care capacity. Their recommendations relate to, among others, ICU capacity and ICU staffing. More specifically, they recommend to make plans for an increase in capacity as a result of a rapid increase in critically ill COVID-19 patients.",

In the Netherlands, there is a national plan in place for upscaling the number of (ICU) beds for COVID-19 patients. Moreover, to balance the pressure on clinical and ICU beds over the Netherlands, patients may be relocated to different regions; the LCPS (Landelijk Co\u00f6rdinatiecentrum Pati\u00ebnten Spreiding) is the Dutch center responsible for these relocations. In both situations, regions and local hospitals need a couple of days to modify the number of available COVID-19 beds, and thus require occupancy predictions of a couple of days ahead.",

For this, we employ a linear programming model that is inspired by smoothing splines that incorporates weekly seasonality and requires little data. The prediction has interpretations in terms of the day-to-day reproduction factor. These arrival predictions, together with information about the length-of-stay (LoS) distribution, is used in the second step to predict hospital occupancy. This second step uses methods stemming from queueing theory, specifically from discrete-time infinite server queues. In this paper we use publicly available data to make predictions at the national level. The same model was and is used to make predictions at the regional level at the LCPS.",

Recently, [10] used an ensemble of two forecasting methods for a short-term forecast of occupied COVID-19 beds in Italy. Furthermore, [31] applied epidemic models for short-term ICU occupancy forecasts in Switzerland; [19] uses a similar approach for the situation in France. The authors of [20] focus on a collection of countries and provide predictive analytic tools for excess demand in the supply chain due to COVID-19. We refer to [12] for an overview of the transmission dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic. The studies above focus directly on the number of occupied beds. We think that queueing-based insight is essential to understand the relation between arrivals and occupancy, which the studies above are lacking. The study of [18] provides such a queueing-theoretic foundation. They explicitly focus on bed demand due to COVID-19 and use queueing models to present scenarios for the occupancy based on different arrival patterns of patients, that are based on different measures taken. However, the paper does not involve short-term predictions. For a more extensive exposition of these types of queues in health care, we refer the reader to [28] .",

            "text": "There are different possibilities for building a model for admissions. An obvious option is a statistical model that uses historical values to make predictions. A disadvantage of such a model is that trend changes cannot be predicted. Also, many classical statistical models require a substantial number of observations in order to produce reliable predictions, whereas data is typically scarce when a new pandemic arises. Furthermore, one would assume that somehow data on positive tests could be used, and that presumably positive tests occur before admissions, such that data on tests can be used to predict later admissions. In Figure 1 data on admissions and positive tests (at the day of registration) are plotted. Data comes from different publicly available sources, in this case NICE and RIVM, as is conveniently gathered at [30] . The solid lines are smoothing splines on the logs of the values. The red bars indicate policy changes (partial lockdowns), it took 13 and 11 days for the numbers of admissions to go down (the black bars). Surprisingly, the number of positive tests spikes at the same days as the number of admissions. For this reason, the number of newly registered positive tests per day cannot be used to predict trend changes in admissions. Another reason are the substantial changes in test policy and behavior. The green bar corresponds to one (of many) changes in test behavior; from that day (Dec 1) on civilians without symptoms could also get a test. We see that this led to a sharp increase in number of positive tests. Hospital admission also increased, but at a lower pace. Other variables than number of positive tests were tried as well on their ability to predict admissions, but they were neither useful. For these reasons we focused on predicting admissions without external variables.",

Since we predict on publicly available data, we cannot use the elapsed length of stay of each individual patient. A reasonable alternative seems to use the stationary residual length of stay (for which P(S r \u2265 t) = \u221e k=t P(S > k)/ES), which follows directly from renewal theory.

The arrival predictions for the clinic are accurate, but for the ICU the model seems to overestimate the number of arrivals. Specifically, the increasing trend does not continue as strongly as suggested by the data up to Dec 22. This also leads to an overestimation of the number of occupied ICU beds (compare the red line with the blue line for the ICU beds). Regarding the occupancy for the clinic, there seems an overestimation of the number of occupied beds for the period from Dec 24 until Dec 28. This is not due to the arrival predictions, as the red and blue lines are rather similar. It seems likely that some patients might be discharged earlier from the clinic in the period around Christmas.",

In Figure 5 the 3-day ahead predictions (with corresponding bandwidth) together with their realizations are shown for the arrivals and occupancies for the ICU and the clinic. Overall, the predictions are visually accurate. We see that the predictions tend to deviate from the realizations at moments when the arrival pattern changes, i.e., when the arrivals reach a local peak or valley. When the number of arrivals is at such a local peak or valley, it takes a couple of days for the arrival prediction to detect that the local trend is changing, and this change is not caused by some random realizations. When the predictions are completely based on the time series (without further contextual information), it seems difficult to overcome such an issue. However, the prediction model is able to adapt to such trend changes after a couple of days.",

Clearly, the relative errors (WAPE) are largest for the admissions, which is partly explained by the fact that the number of arrivals is considerably smaller than the number of occupied beds; see also Remark 2 for the impact of scale. Moreover, it reveals that predicting arrivals is complicated for such a volatile process including changes in trend. The 3-day ahead prediction in the required number of ICU beds is remarkably accurate. Given the inherent randomness in the bed census process, see Remark 2, a WAPE of 3% seems to be the best achievable. For the 7-day ahead prediction of ICU occupancy, we see that the error is mainly determined by the error in the arrival process (9% with forecasted arrivals vs 2% with actual arrivals). Overall, the model performs very well for the most important predictions, i.e., the ICU occupancies. Compared to the ICU, the predictions for the clinic occupancies seem not as good as expected. In particular, even with the actual arrival streams, the WAPE is still 6% and 7% for 3 and 7 days ahead, respectively. These errors can be explained by the discharge behavior at the clinic, where there are only few discharges during the weekend (which are compensated during the week). We like to emphasize that the discharge behavior during the week only has a modest impact on the prediction results in our current practice, as the predictions are only used for at specific days during the week.",

            "text": "Finally, we consider the impact of the number of days ahead on the accuracy (MAE and WAPE) of the ICU predictions in Figure 7 . The red line concerns the arrivals, whereas the blue line is the prediction of the occupancy; the green line is the occupancy in case the actual arrivals are used (and deviations are due to the LoS). As the scale differs between arrivals and occupancy, the MAE is considerably smaller and the WAPE considerably larger for the arrivals compared to the occupancy. Of course, the predictions become less accurate when the forecast is longer ahead. If the actual number of arrivals are known, we see that the occupancy predictions (green line) remain quite accurate even for 14 days ahead. Hence, prediction of the arrival process is crucial, in particular for predictions that are more than a week ahead. The assessment of the accuracy of predictions is complicated by the inherent randomness in arrivals and LoS. For instance, suppose that our aim is to predict the value of a Poisson random variable with rate \u00b5; the Poisson distribution typically reflects the randomness in arrivals or occupancy. The most accurate prediction would be\u0177 t = \u00b5. In that case, with n \u2192 \u221e and using [6] , we have MAE = 2\u00b5 \u00b5 +1 e \u2212\u00b5 / \u00b5 !, WAPE = MAE/\u00b5, and RMSE = \u221a \u00b5. For example, for \u00b5 equal to 50, 500, and 2000, the MAE is 5.6, 17.8, and 35.7, respectively, whereas the WAPE is 11.3%, 3.6%, and 1.8%, respectively.",

The model first predicts the arrivals and then employs a queueing-based method to convert arrivals into occupancy. The predictions for the ICU occupancies are accurate, in particular for 3 days ahead. For the clinical occupancies, there is a seasonal component in discharges, with considerably less discharges during the weekend, that affects the performance of the predictions averaged over all days. An interesting topic for further research is to take the seasonal component in discharges into account as well.",

In essence, the framework is also suitable for longer-term scenarios, but an appropriate approximation of the behavior of the arrival process is then crucial. Moreover, COVID-19 admissions consume a considerable part of the resources at the ICs and clinics in the Netherlands. Additional resources were also used, such as post-anesthesia recovery beds, and anesthesiologists who worked as buddies next to the intensivists. This also reduced other forms of hospital capacity, together leading to reduced capacity for other forms of care leading to waiting lists for multiple forms of care. It is hard to quantify the impact of the delays. For example, [11] reports up to 50000 \"healthy years of life lost\" due to the first wave, based on 28% of the specialist medical care. However, some of this loss can be recovered if extra treatments are provided in the future. There is no centralized information on the length of waiting lists and the rate at which lives are lost.",

For the moment the daily admissions have not reached the peak level of the first wave, but the rise and decline of the second wave has been much slower, leading to a higher number of patients and days of hospitalization. This inevitably leads to more delayed care, it is highly likely that waiting lists will become at least twice as long. This has a quadratic impact on the years of life lost: if twice as many patients wait on average twice as long before treatment, the total impact is 4 times higher. This amplifies the need for an efficient use of resources and good predictions of required capacity. ",
