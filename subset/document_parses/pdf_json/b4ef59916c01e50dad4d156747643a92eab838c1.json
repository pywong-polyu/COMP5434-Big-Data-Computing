The prevention and management of these patients, especially those with multiple co-morbidities, will require an improved understanding of the causal determinants of individual and overlapping diseases, including potential genetic factors [7] . Alongside this, there can be co-payment issues in a number of African countries, which can also have catastrophic consequences on patients and their families [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] . Consequently, healthcare professionals (HCPs), especially physicians and pharmacists, across Africa need to be aware of potential multiple co-morbidities among their patients and their subsequent impact on patient management, as well as the costs of medicines prescribed, to improve outcomes; however, this is not always the case [13] .",

Unless addressed, this will increase antimicrobial resistance (AMR) rates, increasing morbidity, mortality, and costs [17, [23] [24] [25] . However, the availability of trained pharmacists, coupled with the awareness of current regulations, can reduce inappropriate dispensing of antibiotics without a prescription, as seen in Kenya and Namibia [17, [26] [27] [28] , similar to other low-and middle-income countries (LMICs) [29] . For this to routinely happen, though, pharmacy education needs to be strengthened across Africa [14, 30, 31] . This is particularly important at this time since concerns with inappropriate prescribing and dispensing of antimicrobials across Africa have been enhanced by the COVID-19 pandemic [9, 32] . Published studies suggest that 70% or more of patients with COVID-19 have received antibiotics even when not clinically indicated [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] . This is because less than 10% of patients with COVID-19 appear to have either fungal or bacterial co-infections warranting an antimicrobial, driving up AMR rates [39] [40] [41] .",

            "text": "However, advancing medical and pharmacy education during the pandemic has been a major challenge across countries including African countries [50, 57, 58] . In the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, universities across Africa had to respond quickly by offering online classes/courses and practical sessions for healthcare students, and these often had to be offered in smaller groups. The need for practical skills training for physicians and pharmacists is essential to enable them to perform their clinical roles, recognising that delivering both didactic and practice learning remotely is challenging. This meant that both faculty members and students had to firstly become familiar with new technologies and platforms if not already familiar with them, and faculty members needed to deliver lectures and practicals safely whilst preserving the quality and consistency of educational processes as much as possible. Students also needed to cope with issues of Internet connectivity and access to computers to fully participate in e-learning approaches [59] [60] [61] [62] [63] [64] [65] [66] [67] . The financial challenges that this situation imposed among both staff members and students across Africa were quite considerable. This was in addition to the lack of suitable equipment and facilities for online learning among many African students, especially disadvantaged students, certainly initially [68] (Table 1) . Agreed standards are also increasingly needed to enhance online learning experiences given the current challenges, including successfully transferring courses and assessments online [61, [69] [70] [71] . Alongside this, as mentioned, there must be good availability and access to the Internet and appropriate software packages, as well as availability of computers among students, especially those from disadvantaged backgrounds, to facilitate e-learning [50, 61, 62, [71] [72] [73] . However, this was not always the case (Table 1, Supplementary  Table S1 with Supplementary Table S1 containing more details for each location). Key challenges across Africa at the start of the pandemic included the need to rapidly improve staff skills to transfer courses online, the lack of suitable technology equipment among students, and the costs and availability of the Internet, as well as how to conduct practicals within COVID-19 restrictions (Table 1) .",

For clinical teaching, more priority has been given to final-year medical students to be trained at the KSU medical city, while for other years, training and education has been conducted mainly in the Clinical Skills and Simulation Centre (CSSC) at the college with provisions to provide adequate orientation to the faculty members and students regarding educational and training activities to ensure smooth running of the programme [77] .",

This is similar to other LMICs, including Jordan [50, 88, 123] . There was also a considerable unplanned financial burden among both universities and students at the start of the pandemic with the need to purchase computers, tablets, and other ICT support systems necessary for e-learning, as well as the cost of Internet bundles and user fees among staff and students. These factors affected all key stakeholders involved in HCP education across Africa at the start of the pandemic. This included governments, non-governmental organisations, and the private sector, as well as the institutions, staff, and students (Tables 1 and 3 ). The situation regarding medical and pharmacy education at the start of the pandemic was different, though, in Saudi Arabia, with greater infrastructure initially with its greater resources (Box 1). However, despite this, there were still a number of issues that needed addressing in Saudi Arabia at the start of the pandemic, including the optimal blending of online and face-to-face teaching, with the findings from recent studies likely to influence future teaching approaches (Box 1).",

These include addressing concerns with the lack of infrastructure and competency in e-learning approaches. In addition, there were concerns about shortages of ICT equipment, especially among disadvantaged students, as well as the cost of Internet bundles. Alongside this, coping with learning at home given competing demands and the availability of quiet places to teach and learn were significant concerns. There were also concerns with conducting practicals and clinical teaching sessions with social distancing and other measures in place, including WASH, which necessitated breaking students down into smaller groups [77] . In addition, there were concerns with the need for greater investment in simulation-based learning (SBL) although countries are learning from each other to address this. Tables 4, 5 and 7 discuss the different responses among the various institutions across Africa to address these multiple challenges. These included instigating training seminars, webinars, and other types of development platforms for both staff and students, along with developing innovative approaches to e-learning, including the use of videos, turning existing university electronic media into learning management systems, and exploring the potential for hybrid teaching sessions. Whilst this may have incurred initial logistical challenges within universities, faculty development programmes have allowed for more certainty in how to approach new modalities, stimulated the development of future practice approaches, and provided opportunities for professional development [124] [125] [126] . Alongside this, we are aware of innovative approaches to the training of surgeons in addition to those documented (Tables 4-7) . These include enhancing video platforms and online teaching of instrument identification, suturing, and knot tying [127] [128] [129] .",

These concerns are largely due to the necessary transition to online platforms, which cannot always be invigilated, and the requirement that physical assessments must be conducted outside of the authentic environment during any pandemic, e.g., objective-structured clinical assessments. Although institutions have done much to implement a variety of quality control processes, mistrust in the process is still evident in a number of African countries, and future research is needed to assess the effectiveness of different strategies to address remaining fears and provide future guidance.

However, this will require the necessary infrastructure, equipment, and personnel to effectively take this forward. Activities potentially include establishing e-learning centres within universities where these currently do not exist, developing quality standards for e-learning, providing adequate technological resources, i.e., online platforms, and ensuring the necessary training for faculty members and students.

This is because challenges regarding the mental health and well-being of staff and students was a common observation across Africa (Table 3) . Mental health issues among staff and students were generally linked to concerns including uncertainty with the pandemic in terms of altered working conditions. Alongside this, difficulties with maintaining a work-life balance; fear of the implications of the transition to e-learning on teaching, learning, and assessments; and the loss of face-to-face support networks, with burnout of students and lecturers an ongoing concern [146] [147] [148] .

We have also seen key stakeholder groups come together to address concerns with ICT support for students, especially disadvantaged students, as well as the costs of Internet bundles, with such collaborative approaches likely to grow.

We have seen different institutions successfully adopt a variety of strategies to address these challenges, with hybrid learning here to stay. Consequently, it is unlikely that institutions across Africa will revert to the same educational strategies that were in place prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, especially with continued investment and research into e-learning opportunities and systems. We will continue to monitor the situation to provide future guidance. Funding: There was no funding for this research project or the write-up.",
