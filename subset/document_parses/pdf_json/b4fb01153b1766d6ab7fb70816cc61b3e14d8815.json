The Hi-C scaffolder GRAAL (Genome Re-Assembly Assessing Likelihood from 3D) is a probabilistic program that uses a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach.

First, we rewrote the memory-critical parts of the program, such as permutation sampling and likelihood calculation, so that they are computed using sparse contact maps. We reduced the software's dependency footprint and added detailed documentation, deployment scripts, and containers to ease its installation. Finally, we opened up multiple hard-coded parameters to give more control for end-users while improving the documentation on each of them and selecting relevant default parameters that can be implemented for a wide range of applications (see options online and the \"Discussion\" section).

We addressed these points by identifying and putting aside these problematic sequences during a filtering step. These sequences are subsequently reinserted into the final scaffolds, whenever possible (see the \"Material and methods\" section), with the help of linkage data when available.

Each recursive instance of the sum-pooling is subsequently referred to as a level of the contact map. A level determines the resolution at which permutations are being tested: the higher the level, the lower the resolution, the longer the sequences being permuted and, consequently, the faster the computation.

More qualitatively, each run led to the formation of 27 main scaffolds ( Fig. 2a) with the 27th largest scaffold being more than a hundred times longer than the 28th largest one (Fig. 3 , Additional file 1: movie S1). Each of the 27 scaffolds was between four and ten times longer than the combined length of the remaining sequences (Fig. 3 ). This strongly suggests that the 27 scaffolds correspond to chromosomes, a number consistent with karyotype analyses [28] . Taken together, these results indicate that instaGRAAL successfully assembled the Ectocarpus sp. genome into chromosome-level scaffolds.

N50 increased more than tenfold, from 496,777 bp to 6,867,074 bp after the initial scaffolding and to 6,942,903 bp after the correction steps. 99.4% of the sequences in the 1018 contigs were integrated into the 27 largest scaffolds after instaGRAAL processing. Overall, the analysis indicated that many of the rearrangements found in the LG v2 assembly were potentially errors and that both GRAAL and instaGRAAL were efficient at placing large regions where they belong in the genome, albeit less accurately for GRAAL and in the absence of correction.

The pipeline proceeded as follows: first, we acquired 259,556,174 short paired-end shotgun reads (Illumina HiSeq2500 and 4000) as well as 1,353,202 long reads generated using PacBio and Nanopore (about 150\u00d7 short reads and 15\u00d7 long reads).

Local misassemblies, e.g., local bin inversions or disruptive insertions of small scaffolds within larger ones, are an inevitable consequence of the algorithm's most erratic random walks. These small misassemblies are retained because flipping a bin does not markedly change the relative distance of an RFs relative to its neighbors, and because small scaffolds typically carry less signal and therefore exhibit a greater variance in terms of acceptable positions. Depending on the trust put in the initial set of contigs, one may be unwilling to tolerate these changes as well as \"partial translocations,\" i.e., the splitting of an original contig into two scaffolds. The prevalence of such mistakes can be estimated by comparing the orientation of bins relative to their neighbors in the instaGRAAL v4 assembly vs. the original assembly (v1 assembly). Our assumption is that if a single bin was flipped or split by instaGRAAL, this was likely a mistake that needed to be corrected. Consequently, we chose to remain faithful to the input contigs of the original v1 assembly, given that the initial Ectocarpus sp. v1 (reference) genome sequence was based on Sanger reads. Our correction therefore aims at reinstalling the initial contig structure and orientation while preserving to a maximum extent the overall instaGRAAL scaffold structure. In addition, our correction reintegrates into the assembly the bins removed during the initial filtering process according to their position along the original assembly contigs. Most filtered bins corresponded to the extremities of the original contigs, because their size depended on the position of the restriction sites within the contig, or because they consisted of repeated sequences with little or no read coverage.

To give the user a fine-grained degree of control over our correction procedures, the implementation into instaGRAAL is split into independent modules that each assume about the initial contig structure necessary to perform the correction: the \"reorient\" module assumes that the initial contigs do not display inversions, and the \"rearrange\" module assumes that there are no relocations within contigs.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Refinement/correction step"}, {"text": "We underline that despite the improvements brought about by these new procedures, instaGRAAL assemblies remain perfectible, notably because of the reliance on the quality of the input contigs used for correction.

Because of the resulting low signal-to-noise ratio, an invalid prior model will be generated, and when referring to this model, the algorithm will fail to scaffold the bins properly, if at all.

Because binning cannot be performed beyond the resolution of individual input contigs, however small they may be, there is a fixed upper limit to the scale at which a given matrix can be binned. A highly fragmented genome with many small input contigs will necessarily generate a high-noise, high-resolution matrix. Attempts to reassemble a genome based on such a matrix will run into the problems discussed above (resolution). This limitation can be alleviated, to some extent, by discarding the smallest contigs, with the hope that the remaining contigs will cover enough of the genome. The input contigs that are removed can be reintegrated into the final scaffold during the correction steps. This ensures an improved Nx metric while retaining genome completeness. It should be noted, however, that the size of the input contigs is important as they need to contain sufficient restriction sites, and each of the restriction fragments must have sufficient coverage. The choice of enzyme and the frequency of its corresponding site are thus crucial. For instance, with an average of one restriction site every 600 to 1000 bp for DpnII, input contigs as short as 10 kb may contain enough information to be correctly reassembled.

Finding the correct combination of CUDA and Python dependencies to install instaGRAAL on a given machine can be challenging as well. Therefore, our benchmarking attempt should be rather seen as a way to stress the importance of implementing sensible default parameters that readily cover as many use cases as possible for the end user.

However, none of what we outlined previously assumes anything specific about the genomes at hand beyond very broad metrics such as their total size or N50. The parameters of the program scale intuitively with such metrics. For larger genomes, one may simply increase the size of the bins so that the contact map does not grow too large, which is what we did for the human genome. The N50 sets the resolution limit in that it is often desirable to be able to break down contigs into many bins of roughly equal size so as not to run into the aforementioned size bias and also to be able to give more flexibility to the program. For instance, an N50 close to 100 kb should not feature bins larger than 50-60 kb. Oftentimes, however, such minutiae is not necessary, and for most genome projects ranging across 10 7 -10 9 bp, instaGRAAL will typically work out of the box with default parameters.

Assembling diploid, if not polyploid, genomes with well-characterized haplotypes is a stumbling block in the field. Moreover, such problems are more likely to be encountered as the low-hanging fruit gets picked. Typical projects involve assembling many individual complete human genomes with haplotypes, or the sequencing and scaffolding of even larger and more complex genomes such as that of plants. In this context, instaGRAAL in particular (and Hi-C in general) is relatively agnostic, as its success or failure will hinge on the reference genome being properly haplotyped in the first place. While it may prove intractable to phase haplotypes directly from only Hi-C data, instaGRAAL will conserve such information when provided in the first place. This is because the scaffolder is robust to local disruptions like haplotype-induced mapping artifacts. It has been shown that GRAAL and by extension instaGRAAL will eventually resolve such disruptions even when the distribution is noisy, as long as the general three-parameter model (and power law) still holds globally [13, 19, 20] . In other words, even though instaGRAAL cannot \"guess\" whether a given reference sequence is homologous or heterozygous without considerable difficulty, it can still cleanly scaffold chromosome pairs from clear contig pairs because the global 3D intra-signature from a given contig is too strong to be confused with mapping artifacts in a pair. Should such information be missing, the scaffolder will likely interlace all regions into a giant linkage group.

As long-read technologies become more affordable, there is an increasing demand to reconcile the scaffolding capabilities of Hi-C-based methods with the ability of long reads to span regions that are difficult to assemble, such as repeated sequences. The most intuitive approach would be to perform Hi-C scaffolding on an assembly derived from high-coverage and corrected long reads, as was done for several previous assembly projects [16, 38] . Alternative approaches also exist, such as generating Hi-C-and long-read-based assemblies separately and merging them using programs such as CAMSA [39] or Metassembler [40] . Pipelines such as PBJelly [41] have proven successful at filling existing gaps in draft genomes, regardless of their origin, with the help of long reads. Lastly, with assembly projects involving both long and short reads, hybrid assemblies and hybrid polishing have become an important focus. Polishers such as Racon [42] or Pilon [43] are widely used, and new tools such as HyPo are also emerging [44] . Yet the question of which kind of pipeline to use (e.g., Racon to Hi-C scaffolding to Pilon, or Racon to Pilon to Hi-C scaffolding, etc.) along which hybrid assembler (Masurca, Alpaca, hybridSPAdes, etc.) [31, 45, 46] can prove cumbersome, and often finding the process yielding the most satisfying output in terms of metrics involves much trial-and-error with different configurations. InstaGRAAL shows that high-quality metrics can still be attained without the help of long reads, but long-read polishing may still be necessary in order to get rid of the lingering errors we mentioned.
