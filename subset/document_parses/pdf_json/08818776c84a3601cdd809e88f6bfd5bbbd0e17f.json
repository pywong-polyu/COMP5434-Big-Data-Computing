Demographic data, the type of rescue missions, the number of missions per day, the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics Score (NACA-score), the frequency of respiratory emergencies (COVID-19 and non-COVID -19 associated), as well as the number of deaths were documented. Results: Mean age was 62.3\u00b124.8 years and 576 (56.5%) were male. Number of missions were 397, 403 and 333 in 2018, 2019 and 2020 respectively. The control room registered a 22% reduction of rescue missions for the year 2020. Even the amount of emergency calls via the emergency number 112 was reduced by 17.4% between 2018 and 2020. 150 (14.9%) missions were due to respiratory emergencies. In 2020 10 missions (28.6% of respiratory emergencies) were COVID-19 related. In 2020 the NACA score increased significantly. Conclusion: We found a decreasing effect of the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany on the number of emergency calls as well as missions, and an increase of the severity of cases in preclinical care for a northern German region with 1.2 million citizens. The effect of these findings caused by COVID-19 on the health care system remains to be seen.",

In addition, there is a geographical proximity between Bavaria and Northern Italy, which had been badly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. For international comparison, the infection and death figures due to COVID-19 of the USA, Italy, Spain and France were used. At the time of the data collection these countries were seriously affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, although, with the exception of the USA, in these European neighbouring countries, nearly comparable health services and socio-economic standards as in Germany, existed. Nevertheless, due to less ICU beds and ventilators per 100,000 citizen the comparability could be relatively limited and this has indeed an impact on the CFP and leads to more worse CFP rates in Italy, Spain and France than in Germany.",

            "text": "Interpretation COVID-19 takes on a special role, as it not only acts as a final diagnosis in the sense of an upper respiratory tract infection, but also as a secondary powerful contributor. In addition to the primary effect of the disease, it can also have a secondary effect, intensified by quarantine measures, on the avoidance behavior of patients in the sense of fear of an increased risk of infection with COVID-19, eg, through close contacts, especially in hospitals. The closure of schools, pre-schools, day-care centers and sports clubs has led to a reduction in everyday activities and thus to a lower risk of acquiring infections at school, during sports activities and on the daily commute. Nevertheless, our data showed even a reduction across all types of rescue missions, so that we could not confirm this effect. Despite this, an increase in the severity of illness of the NACA (National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics) score could be shown for HEMS (air ambulance [helicopter emergency medical service]). This could be due to the fact that the patients with minor illnesses did not call the emergency services out of fear and thus a shift to higher NACA values occurred. However, it could also be an expression of the time delay until the emergency call is made since patients wait and only call when the symptoms are more severe. These circumstances could have led to a reduction in the use of emergency medical services as well as greatly delayed decision making until the emergency consultation occurred. These facts could also explain the reduction in the number of interventions. This is also confirmed by the reduced number of emergency calls. Nevertheless, the quarantine situation may have led to a reduced stress situation in addition to avoidance behavior, which could also explain the reduction of ambulance requests. Whereas Marijon et al showed a significant increase in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest incidence, coupled with a reduction in survival during the specified time period of the pandemic when compared with the equivalent time period in previous years with no pandemic, 13 Trabattoni et al reported that there has been a demonstrable reduction of about 25% in the treatment of heart attacks. 8 This would be in line with our results, as we were also able to prove a reduction in the number of treatments for the abovementioned period. But this is contradicted by a UK (United Kingdom) study, which reports no changes in the number of heart attacks and strokes. 14 Also, Baldi et al showed a cumulative incidence of diagnosed Covid-19 and cases of out-of-hospital cardiac arrests in Italy. Furthermore, the authors showed that the cumulative incidence of out-of-hospital cardiac arrests in 2020 was strongly associated with the cumulative incidence of COVID-19. The number of cases of out-of-hospital cardiac arrests compared to 2019 increased also. 15 These findings may be explained with different CFPs (case fatality proportion) in these regions. A region with comparably low CFPs like ours may have a problem with avoidance behavior of the general public, thus reducing the utilization of medical services. Whereas regions with higher CFPs as an expression of more severe courses of the pandemic itself have to deal with COVID linked diseases and deaths, clouding the reduction in utilization of medical services and resulting in equivalent or even higher disease and death rates. 16 ",
