At the individual level, the traditional IPI model incurs substantial cost, stress, and time commitments that can negatively impact individuals' current training program, and at the program level, there is the strain of cost, time, and resource utilization. The interview process for surgical residency and fellowship is very time-consuming and costly, 3 and the introduction of videoconferencing to supplement or replace the traditional interview process has been evolving for several years, with primers on videoconferencing, to assist applicants, published both prior to 4 and during the era of COVID-19. 5 The VI format has been implemented in several fields of medicine with promising results. This format has been associated with positive feedback from applicants, improved efficiency, and decreased cost. [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] However, there are also concerns surrounding VI related to the ability to understand the culture of a program and the city in which it is located, as well as experience interactions between faculty and fellows. 12 We had a unique opportunity to compare the effectiveness of VI with the traditional IPI format using two groups of applicants from the same interview cycle. We offered 2 interview days for the CGSO fellowship at the University of North Carolina (UNC) at Chapel Hill in 2020. The first occurred in March 2020, just prior to the widespread implementation of travel restrictions, and was completed using our standard IPI format. The second occurred in April 2020 and was attended virtually by all applicants due to the pandemic travel restrictions. Our goal was to explore how the VI experience compared with the IPI experience regarding the ability to convey a feel of the culture of the program, and to determine if sufficient information was communicated during the interview process for applicants to make an informed ranking decision. Our secondary aim was to learn how the VI experience could be improved upon for future implementation.",

During our IPI, we started with an optional social gathering the night prior to the interview with current fellows and applicants, in downtown Chapel Hill. The morning of the interview, all applicants meet for breakfast and our program director (DWO) gave an information session about the program. The applicants then proceeded to individual interviews (25-28 min) with each of our 12 surgical oncology faculty members. In between the individual interviews, the current fellows were available, in a separate room, to answer questions and discuss the program. For the VI format that we developed this year, there was no virtual social gathering preceding the interview day. On the morning of the interview, all applicants signed into the interview using the Zoom videoconference application (Zoom Video Communications, San Jose, CA, USA). As a group, they received the same informational session that was presented at the IPI by our program director. Our information technology (IT) specialist then moved each applicant to their assigned individual interview (20-22 min). In between each interview, our IT specialist brought all applicants and all faculty back into the shared room (3-5 min) to provide an opportunity for informal interaction with the entire applicant/fellow/faculty group together in one virtual shared room. The process was then repeated throughout the interview day. If an applicant did not have an interview during a given time period, the applicant was brought back to a virtual shared room with the current fellows. This provided time with the fellows alone, without faculty oversight or involvement, to remove any perceived barriers to asking questions about the fellowship program.",

            "text": "This study highlights that while VI replaced the traditional IPI model for many surgical subspecialty fellowships this year due to the COVID-19 pandemic, 2 at our institution we need to continue to improve the model to ensure that we provide a comparable interview experience for applicants to our program. This is especially important in light of the recent recommendations by the Coalition for Physician Accountability stating that, ''All fellowship programs should commit to online interviews and virtual visits for all applicants'' for the upcoming 2020-2021 interview season. 13 We found that although the VI modality gave applicants a satisfactory understanding of the UNC CGSO fellowship and allowed them to accurately represent themselves, virtual interviewees were significantly less likely to feel that the interview experience gave them an adequate picture of the culture of the program or enough information to make an informed ranking decision. This is of substantial consequence, as understanding the culture of a program could arguably be the most important part of the interview process for many applicants. We did find that several participants from the VI group enjoyed seeing the interactions between faculty and fellows, an important component of the culture at UNC, and that our particular virtual format with large group sessions between interviews was somewhat unique in facilitating exposure to these interactions. Applicant interviews using videoconferencing technology has been explored as an alternative or replacement for the traditional IPI model for several years prior to this current global pandemic. 4 Videoconferencing has been utilized during the application process for several different areas of medicine, including surgical fellowship programs. [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] 14 This interview format offers several benefits, including reduced stress and improved time efficiency related to travel, and coordination of time off for multiple interviews during a busy medical school or residency schedule, as well as substantial cost savings related to flights and travel accommodations, which is invaluable as student debt continues to increase. [6] [7] [8] [9] 15 In a national survey of surgical residents, Watson et al. reported that over one-third attend 8-12 interviews and a majority spend over $4000 and miss 7 or more days of clinical training. 15 Cost is an important consideration, not only for the applicants but also for the residency and fellowship programs. Gardner et al. reported that the average interview cost for general surgery residency programs was over $8000 in hard cost, such as food, supplies, and other fees that could otherwise be avoided using the VI format. 3 Despite the wide-ranging benefits of the videoconference format, there are several trepidations that limit its integration. Most of our applicants found the VI to be a positive experience and reported that it gave them a satisfactory understanding of the UNC CGSO fellowship. Additionally, they felt that it allowed them to accurately represent themselves. However, a significant concern for applicants in our study was the ability to understand the culture or feel of the program through the VI format, as well as the ability to get enough information to make a ranking decision. This is very similar to the findings in another highly competitive surgical subspecialty, pediatric surgery. 10 Most pediatric surgery fellowship applicants felt they were able to accurately represent themselves via the virtual format, but both applicants and faculty reported that videoconference interviewing could not substitute for onsite interviews. Daram et al. also describe similar limitations of integrating videoconference into the gastroenterology fellowship selection process. While, overall, they felt that videoconferencing could be an effective and useful tool, they identify three major drawbacks of the process: inability to gain detailed knowledge about the city and the program institution, as well as an inability to effectively interact with fellows and faculty in the program. 12 Collectively, including our study, it is clear that while videoconferencing shows promise as part of the interview process for fellowship programs, there are several areas that need improvement.",

            "text": "To address the recurring theme of the inability to obtain detailed knowledge of the program institution and the city, it will be important to refine the access applicants have to such information. Here at UNC, similar to many other universities, there is a robust virtual tour online for potential undergraduates. We need to harness this expertise to develop an up-to-date online tour of the medical facilities, research opportunities, and surrounding environment. This could include improving the CGSO program website and the information that is sent out prior to the interview, as well as the addition of video content by faculty and current fellows related to the fellowship program. 2 While each of our faculty has personal videos on their faculty profile website, they are not speaking specifically about the fellowship or the training culture at UNC. There are several limitations to our study. This was a single-institution study with a limited sample size, which limits our power to detect significant differences between groups as well as the generalizability of our study. We believe the statistical significance seen in our comparison is real given the free text comments we received and the anecdotal responses we have heard from other CGSO programs. We fully acknowledge that this could be a type II error because of the small sample size, but feel this is unlikely. We would like to study match data from other CGSO sites that also had both IPI and VI interviews to understand if applicant match rates were affected by interview type and how many of the successfully matched fellows across the country matched at a site they visited personally, rather than virtually. We matched a candidate from our IPI day and are very interested to know if there is a pattern to the match of IPI versus VI. It will also be important to explore if there are any significant differences in applicant experience with the VI format based on applicant demographics such as age, geographic proximity to the interview site, marital status, and/or children. For instance, there may also be a geographic bias, with applicants already familiar with the geographic area feeling more comfortable ranking a program based on a VI alone because of previous knowledge of the area. There is also the possibility of a recall bias as the survey was distributed following the second interview, therefore those who participated in the second VI received the study 1 week after their interview, and those who participated in the first IPI received the survey 7 weeks following their interview. There is also the possibility that applicants may be biased toward more favorable responses in hopes of making a more favorable impression and increasing their chance of matching, since the survey was distributed prior to the submission of rank lists. The survey was anonymous and voluntary to help avoid this bias.",

However, this has the potential to create a disparity between those who have the time and can afford to travel and those who do not. We believe that VIs offer potential advantages over IPIs, including cost savings and efficiency, but we need to significantly improve the applicant's ability to gain a feel of the culture of a program and, most importantly, make an informed ranking decision. We feel that most of the VI shortcomings that have been identified in this study can by addressed with purposeful, focused interventions and that this technology has the potential to become a valuable addition to the application process and potentially replace the IPI format. In accordance with the most recent recommendations from the Coalition for Physician Accountability, at least through the coming interview season the CGSO interviews will be in a videoconferencing interview format. We plan to incorporate what we have learned from this study to make improvements to our website, add video content from our faculty and fellows, and provide a dedicated virtual tour of the medical and research facilities as well as the surrounding Chapel Hill area in order to ensure a productive and successful interview season in this era of change.",
