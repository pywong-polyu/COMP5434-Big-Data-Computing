At the same time, copper ore grades continue to decline and extraction operations are increasingly concentrated in low-income regions with decreased enforcement of best practices 2,3 . These regions are also expected to experience the most intense effects of climate change 4 , and copper resources in particular are concentrated in areas of high water scarcity risk 5 .

Several authors have shown that China's domestic secondary copper supply is insufficient to meet its increasing metals demand, where Zeng et al., Wang [20] [21] [22] [23] . With prior studies relying on top-down material flow analyses limited to China and primarily addressing potential scrap availability changes, a significant research gap remains in understanding global supply chain reactions stemming from the solid waste import ban, the resulting environmental impacts, and mechanisms for maximizing environmental benefits in China and globally. We demonstrate that the solid waste import ban causes increased primary refining and copper concentrate imports within China to account for refineries' loss of secondary material, generating effects throughout the material system that produce increasing environmental impacts both in China and globally.",

The model architecture (Fig. 1) differentiates supply chain behavior between China and the rest of the world (RoW) and considers differences in scrap composition, availability, and price in those two regions. We estimate the evolution of cathode and scrap prices, refinery processing fees (treatment and refining charges (TCRC)), and production and consumption of copper scrap, concentrate, and refined material through 2040, primarily reporting results as cumulative departure from baseline. The explicit modeling of mine-level opening, closing, and capacity utilization (CU) decisions; the economic modeling accounting for cascading effects throughout the copper supply chain; and the cost-driven optimization model determining scrap consumption changes between China and RoW highlight the contributions this methodology makes to material supply chain modeling.",

Recent policies affecting copper scrap include the announcement of the ban on Category 7 copper scrap in May 2017 and the imposition of tariffs on US copper scrap imports in August 2018. The ban on Category 7 copper scrap was implemented in December 2018 alongside the announcement of additional restrictions on Category 6 copper scrap imports, set to begin June 2019 23, 33 . These policies have produced a redistribution of copper scrap trade and compositional changes in China's scrap imports (Fig. 2a) . The gross weight of China's copper imports has declined over the past several years, with a corresponding increase in copper fraction producing a near-constant copper content by mass. These data reflect the success of China's policy goal of decreasing low-grade scrap imports and processing and coincide with the redistribution of global scrap trade and processing.",

The solid waste import ban shifts scrap availability from China to RoW, increasing prices in China and decreasing prices for RoW, prompting a redistribution of primary and secondary refining production (Fig. 3b ). Due to time delays and differing magnitudes of scrap availability shifts, the decrease in RoW primary refining and increase in RoW secondary refining lag the opposing responses in China, producing a global increase Fig. 1 Model architecture. Supply-demand imbalances for copper ore, scrap, and cathode are used to calculate treatment charges and refining charges (TCRC), scrap spread, and cathode price evolution, respectively, using inventory-driven price formation. Several of these supply-demand modules are linked; for example, refinery production (supply) uses both copper ore and scrap as raw materials and therefore determines demand for those materials. Likewise, fabricator production determines refined copper cathode and scrap demand through the blending optimization model. With prices formed, econometric time series analysis permits calculation of mine and refinery production evolution. Fabricator demand (consumption of copper) is determined using both cathode price and the exogenous variables gross domestic product (GDP) per capita and sectoral volume predictions. Fabricator demand permits calculation of scrap generation via material flow analysis. The resulting imbalances among these variables permit evolution year over year. in primary refining production and decrease in secondary refining production (Fig. 3d) . Increasing scrap demand in RoW is unable to offset the increasing prices and decreasing demand in China, generating a net decrease in global scrap demand. Resulting changes in cathode price are insufficient to drive a significant departure from baseline and the small increases in mining and primary refining production are erased by market corrections by 2040. While scrap consumption appears approximately linear as a function of scrap quantity restricted, the No.2 ban generates a larger system response than the ban on alloyed scraps for refining, mining, and CO 2 e emission responses (Fig. 3e) .",

This result corresponds with a 29% (25 Mt, 12% of global) increase in CO 2 e emissions from copper within China, equivalent to the annual CO 2 emissions of 5.4 million gasoline vehicles. Without the significant decarbonization of China's electricity grid predicted by the U.S. Energy Information Administration's reference case 35 , global emissions increase by as much as 35 Mt by 2040. This large emissions increase is the result of increased primary refining production, while the decreases in scrap use and fabrication account for the smaller contributions toward decreasing emissions (Fig. 3f) . Increasing primary refining production requires increased concentrate imports-determined endogenously-due to limited domestic copper ore bodies, continuing the present logistic growth trend ( Supplementary Fig. 3 ).",

We increase or decrease China's refined copper imports at rates of 100 or 200 kt/year (Fig. 4a ) coincident with the No.2 scrap ban.

We show that increasing China's refined copper imports redistributes both primary and secondary refining production from China to RoW by shifting regional refined copper demand (Fig. 4c) . Globally, this shift enables better use of displaced scrap material (cumulative 10% of 2020 value, 1.0 Mt), resulting in increased secondary refining (6.4%, 1.3 Mt), decreased primary refining (6.3%, 1.3 Mt), and decreased mining production (5.9%, 1.2 Mt; Fig. 4b ).",

China exhibits a more muted CO 2 e emission response due to its more limited GDP growth reductions and low fraction of global mining production, with the bulk of China and RoW declines attributable to manufacturing contraction (Fig. 5d ). Among small GDP shocks, incorporating larger mine and refinery shocks generates CO 2 e emission reductions equivalent to those of large GDP shocks (Fig. 5e) . Further analysis has shown that these reductions stem from the SR shock specifically (Supplementary Figs. 14 and 15). This shock produces an increase in primary refining production, leading to a copper concentrate supply deficit, mine overproduction, and eventually a price collapse that promotes mine closure and delays mine opening, while limiting secondary refining recovery.

When increasing China's refined copper imports, \u223c80% of the emissions reduction within China is redistributed to RoW, generating a net global decrease in emissions due to economic effects and lower unit impacts in RoW. This value is consequently dependent on the relative environmental impacts of industrial activities for each trade partner, explicitly demonstrating that individual nations' environmental impact reductions may be directly accomplished via burden shifting. To maximize the benefits of this burden shifting, new refineries must be constructed with best available technologies in place and located within low-emission electricity grids.",

We also demonstrate that the solid waste import ban results in increased primary refining and concentrate imports within China to account for refineries' loss of secondary material, generating effects throughout the material system that produce increasing environmental impacts. The solid waste import ban's impacts on scrap availability, and consequently regional prices, drive a redistribution of primary refining from RoW to China and of secondary refining from China to RoW. Even as China's scrap-and manufacturing-related emissions decrease, increasing primary refining production offsets these benefits (Fig. 3f) and generates a net increase in environmental impacts by 2040 across all impact categories considered in this study, both in China and globally (Fig. 3e) . The RoW response rate keeps the redistribution of refining activities from being even and proportional, and secondary refining is projected to decrease globally. The RoW must act quickly to limit this redistribution and develop low-impact secondary processing and refining capacity such that the environmental impacts of the copper supply chain do not increase further still.",

We model evolution of individual mines, with currently operating mines from SNL and an incentive pool of potential mines created by resampling with perturbation mines that have opened during 2015-2018. Ore grade elasticities (OGEs) to cumulative ore production were determined on an individual mine basis. OGEs were determined by simulating mine life, iteratively changing OGE until cumulative ore production from 2017 to closure was within 5% of 2017 reserves, or until the closure year matches SNL's projected closure year if reserves were not reported. Minesite costs, transport and offsite costs, TCRC, and royalties are components of the mine's total cash cost, where the difference between the realized metal price and the total cash cost gives the total cash margin (TCM), which determines mine profitability 61 . We assume hedging profits and losses to be constant, approximating the realized metal price with cathode price. Minesite costs, transport and offsite costs, and royalties are exogenous mine parameters that were held constant throughout these simulations. Short-run ore production changes as mines alter CU, which is modeled according to Eq. (4) following a generalized method of moments dynamic panel regression model performed in previous work 47 where mine CU is assumed equal to 0.4 in ramp up and ramp down periods, which last 3 years after the opening decision and 1 year after the closing decision, respectively. While TCM less than zero indicates that the mine was not profitable in that year, mines are unlikely to shut down or halt production before the depletion of reserves. CU 0 was tuned such that the 2018 average CU in the simulation was equal to the 2018 average CU reported by the ICSG 62 , while TCM 0 was assumed to be the median TCM of all operating mines in 2018 57 . Mine closure decision making is modeled based on anticipated cashflows and maximizing net present value (NPV), comparing the NPVs of entering the 1-year ramp down period in the current year or the next year, incurring reclamation costs in the following year for both cases. If the projected cash flow for the following year is calculated using the maximum value of cathode price from the preceding 5 years, NPV is calculated following Eq. (5).",

We estimate cathode production from refineries as a function of cathode price, TCRC, and scrap spread, outputting concentrate demand, refined scrap demand, and cathode supply. Smelters are treated as part of the refining process. While SX-EW mines also produce copper cathode, they are included in the primary supply module and their production is directly added to total cathode production. Here primary refineries process only copper concentrate, while secondary refineries process both concentrate and scrap, with the fraction of raw material from scrap defined as the SR. We conducted generalized method of moments dynamic panel regression models of primary refinery CU, secondary refinery CU, and secondary refinery SR as functions of TCRC and No.2 scrap spread. Individual-level refinery data and TCRC from 1992 to 2016 was obtained from SNL 57 and No.2 spread from Fastmarkets AMM 65 . We model refineries as one primary and secondary refinery each for both China and RoW. Refinery production is the product of capacity and CU, where capacity was assumed to follow cathode consumption with a 1-year lag, following the direction of industry interviews. The resulting evolution of primary CU, secondary CU, and SR are described by Eqs. (7)- (9) . In developing the China-RoW regional model, cathode prices, TCRC, and mining evolution were assumed to behave as global parameters due to market liquidity, while scrap spreads, copper demand, primary and secondary refined copper production and consumption, and scrap production and consumption required regionalization. China's scrap and refined copper imports were specified as exogenous variables, while concentrate imports were implicit in regional refinery operation. Scrap spreads evolve as a function of the scrap SD balance and the change in cathode price, and scrap spread elasticities to changes in these values retained their global values from the previous model. However, scrap spreads were modeled at the regional level to enable changes in regional scrap availability to impact scrap consumption and thus regional refinery evolution. The deviation of China and RoW scrap prices from the calculated global values was further explored as a model sensitivity as discussed in Supplementary Methods: Sensitivity to scrap SD elasticities. Total copper demand was previously calculated by region-China, EU, Japan, North America, and other-and was simply regrouped to reflect the China-RoW split.",

Annual post-consumer scrap generation values for China and RoW were calculated using standard dMFA methods with lognormal sectoral lifetime distributions, with sectoral collection rates and recycling efficiencies for both regions. Refined metal markets were assumed to be sufficiently liquid to permit any quantity to be consumed at the same unit price globally, but given availability concerns associated with postconsumer scrap consumption, post-consumer scrap prices were determined using an order book formulation, where average purchasing prices increased with total quantities consumed within each region. Given that inventories were sufficiently large that each scrap grade was not fully consumed each year, this formulation permitted an increase in regional scrap availability in a given year to produce an increase in scrap consumption in that region. The resulting equations describing scrap prices relative to quantities consumed were formulated for each scrap grade as functions of scrap availability and scrap price, which was determined using econometric time series analysis. Following the assumption that scrap markets are illiquid, scrap prices were allowed to change based on regional SD imbalances.

Additional regional scaling factors, R r , were implemented such that the calculated average ore grade for that region (from SNL, Supplementary Table 11 ) produced the regional unit CO 2 emissions, energy, or water value for Ecoinvent processes for copper concentrate (sulfide ore) or copper (from SX-EW). Regions include Oceania, Africa, Europe, North America, China, other Asia, and Latin America. Further details are described in previous work 47 . These processes were used to calculate the emissions or consumption for each mine individually, where the remaining nine TRACI indicators were calculated based on the ratio of CO 2 e emissions to each indicator for the respective region in Ecoinvent 3. We assume that the global distribution of mining activities remains constant from 2018 through 2040. Regional SX-EW mining environmental impacts were determined using the SimaPro global value for copper from SX-EW, scaled by the impacts of regional concentrate mining relative to global average concentrate impacts. Due to the exponential nature of the mine impact calculations, individual mine unit impacts were capped according to the highest values from Northey et al. for concentrate mines 67 , with caps of 10 kg CO 2 /kg Cu, 150 MJ/kg, and 0.27 m 3 water/kg. With less data available for SX-EW mines, we scaled these values by the ratio between the highest calculated regional SX-EW mine impact and the highest regional concentrate mine impact for each impact category, giving maxima of 28 kg CO 2 /kg Cu, 450 MJ/kg, and 0.27 m 3 water/kg. Impacts for the remaining supply chain components follow values from Ecoinvent 3, TRACI 2.1, Cumulative Energy Demand V1.11, Berger et al. 68 , Giurco et al. 69 , and Chen et al. 70 . Here primary refining includes smelting impacts as well, and both primary and secondary refining are treated at the regional level. Direct melting of scrap is treated globally due to data limitations but is a function of scrap grade (Supplementary Table 15 ). Semi-finished goods manufacturing unit impacts are semi-regional, with global impacts from wire drawing on \u223c56% of production based on data from Gl\u00f6ser et al. 46 . The remainder is treated using metal working impacts, with Europe and North America using one set of impacts and other regions using impacts for RoW (Supplementary Table 17 ). For all of these impacts, we assume the regional distribution within RoW remains constant, with the fraction of primary refining, secondary refining, direct melt scrap consumption, and manufacturing occurring in China and RoW being results of model evolution. We assume that refining impacts do not change as functions of ore grade and that manufacturing and scrap direct melting impacts do not change over time, in alignment with previous studies 71 . We modeled regional changes in CO 2 e emission intensity of electricity generation following the U.S. Energy Information Administration's reference case, which projects a 14% decline globally from 2018 to 2040 (Supplementary  Table 20) 35 . This reference case indicates a 22% decline in global CO 2 e emission intensity of electricity generation using the 2010-2050 range of Ciacci et al. 71 , which falls between their \"market rules\" (10% decline) and \"toward resilience\" (32% decline) scenarios. Industrial sources generally state that comminution accounts for at least 50% of mine energy consumption, while academic studies have reported 46% of copper mine CO 2 emissions from comminution 72 , 48-62% of mine energy as electricity 67 , and 70% of all mine energy for comminution 73 . With comminution requiring electricity for the operation of mechanical grinding apparatuses, we assume that 55% of copper mining activity energy consumption is in the form of electricity, with the remainder being primary energy unaffected by decreased emission intensity of electricity. Annual CO 2 e emissions calculated using the original parameters were scaled according to the regional emission intensity change relative to 2018.",
