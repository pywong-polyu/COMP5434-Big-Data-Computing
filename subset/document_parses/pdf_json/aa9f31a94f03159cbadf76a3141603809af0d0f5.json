Currently, no test combines detection of widely used SARS-CoV-2 E-and N-gene targets and a sample control in a single, multiplexed reaction. We developed the IGI-LuNER RT-qPCR assay using the Luna Probe Universal One-Step RT-qPCR master mix with publicly available primers and probes to detect SARS-CoV-2 N gene, E gene, and human RNase P (NER). This combined, cost-effective test can be performed in 384well plates with detection sensitivity suitable for clinical reporting, and will aid in future sample pooling efforts, thus improving throughput of SARS-CoV-2 detection.",

However, variability in test format as well as reagent availability, quality, and cost continue to hamper widespread use for both symptomatic and asymptomatic testing. One commercially available test entered the scene early, allowing clinical laboratories to rapidly detect multiple viral genes and control RNA in a single reaction; however, this test has reported risks of yielding inaccurate results 11 and suffers from supply shortages and high cost. Another less-expensive test detects only a single viral locus, which can lead to false-negative results 12,13 and several tests require 2-3 separate PCR reactions to yield clinical results 9,14,15 .

While other groups have adopted extraction-free methods, 384-well formats, or multiplexed PCR reactions to improve turnaround times, these assays are limited by the fact that they 1) target a single site in the viral genome, 2) require 2-3 separate PCR reactions, or 3) utilize proprietary primer and probe sequences that are expensive and/or not widely available 18 . The IGI-LuNER assay addresses these shortcomings by combining affordable, publicly and commercially available SARS-CoV-2 reagents into a multiplexed 384well reaction. We show that the IGI-LuNER assay has improved sensitivity and greater than 95% clinical concordance compared to a similar multiplexed assay.",

Additionally, the IGI-LuNER assay eliminates sample \"Inconclusive\" results based on amplification of only one viral gene and will likely reduce the number of \"Invalid\" results by implementing an internal human extraction control, thereby reducing the number of samples that must be re-tested for further cost and reagent savings. Of note, the RNase P primers designed by the CDC may amplify both RNA and genomic DNA 19 ; thus using a redesigned RNase P reverse primer that specifically detects RNA or incorporating DNase digestion of the sample prior to RT-qPCR may improve the test further. Although vaccines are expected to be administered in early 2021, diagnostic testing for SARS-CoV-2 will remain necessary for surveillance. The IGI-LuNER assay will improve accessibility for SARS-CoV-2 testing by reducing costs and can be easily adapted to detect new SARS-CoV-2 variants or novel pathogens in the future.",

Spurious amplification could be occasionally observed at Ct values > 42. A sample is called positive when N gene or E gene has Ct values < 40 (RNase P is ignored). A sample is called negative when N gene and E gene have Ct values \u2265 40 and RNase P has a Ct value < 35. A sample is called invalid when N gene and E gene have Ct values \u2265 40 and RNase P has Ct \u2265 35. Ct values may be returned as \"undetermined\" if there is no amplification (treated the same as Ct \u2265 40 or \u2265 35). Samples that result as invalid are re-tested from RNA extraction.Two controls undergo the full process of RNA extraction. The \"NC\" control (50:50 2xRNA Shield:1xPBS) is valid when N gene and E gene have Ct values \u2265 40 and RNase P has Ct \u2265 35, controlling for background amplification or contamination. The \"HC\" control (50:50 2xRNA Shield:1xPBS with human RNA) is valid when N gene and E gene have Ct values \u2265 40 and RNase P has a Ct value < 35, controlling for non-specific amplification, contamination, and retention of genomic material.
