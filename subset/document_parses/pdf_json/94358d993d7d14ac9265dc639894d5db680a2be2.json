Given HAPS quasi-static positioning at the stratosphere, HAPS-to-ground and HAPS-to-air connectivity frameworks are expected to be prolific in terms of data acquisition and computing, especially given the mild weather and quasi-constant wind speed characteristics of the stratospheric layer. This paper explores the opportunities stemming from the realization of cloud-enabled HAPS in the context of telecommunications applications and services. The paper first advocates for the potential physical advantages of deploying HAPS as flying data-centers, also known as super-macro base stations. The paper then describes various cloud services that can be offered from the HAPS and the merits that can be achieved by this integration, such as enhancing the quality, speed, and range of the offered services. The proposed services span a wide range of fields, including satellites, Internet of Things (IoT), ad hoc networks (such as sensor; vehicular; and aerial networks), gaming, and social networks. For each service, the paper illustrates the methods that would be used by cloud providers to offload the service data to the HAPS and enable the cloud customers to consume the service. The paper further sheds light on the challenges that need to be addressed for realizing practical cloud-enabled HAPS, mainly, those related to high energy, processing power, quality of service (QoS), and security considerations. Finally, the paper discusses some open issues on the topic, namely, HAPS mobility and message routing, HAPS security via blockchain and machine learning, artificial intelligence-based resource allocation in cloud-enabled HAPS, and integration with vertical heterogeneous networks.",

Although more than half of the global population is already connected to the Internet, there is still a need for higher broadband connectivity and telecommunication services in suburban, rural, and isolated areas that remain underserved. In addition, ground networks are susceptible to failures and degraded performance in many situations, such as natural disasters, severe weather conditions, and changing environments. For these reasons, several types of aerial networks are being considered as a means to provide both stable broadband connectivity to end-users and communication links between the mobile and core networks for backhauling purposes. These two types of applications could open the way to wireless broadband deployment in distant locations, such as mountains, seaside, and desert areas. The HAPS is expected to be among the major networks that will assist the ground infrastructure in future telecommunication systems. With its wide footprint (500 km radius per node) and reduced round-trip delay (0.13 to 0.33 milliseconds (ms)) [5] , HAPS is ideal for low-latency and mobile applications that require continuous connectivity, as it relieves such applications from the burden of frequent handoffs that occur in ground networks.",

Consequently, network traffic has been growing so fast that current backhaul networks will soon fail to handle all traffic demands. A backhaul network provides connectivity between the cellular base stations (such as 4G eNBs and 5G gNBs) and the core network; it significantly impacts the performance of the whole network, and it is one of the major challenges in beyond 5G (B5G) and 6G. Towards supporting the backhauling requirements of future 6G networks, the development of a supplementary backhaul network is considered vital. As one of the solutions, a wireless backhaul network based on an aerial platform has been proposed by several research projects [6, 7] . These backhaul networks could utilize one or more types of wireless signals (such as radio frequency (RF), millimeter waves (mmWaves), microwaves, lasers, and free space optics (FSO)) in order to provide self-sufficiency, flexibility, and encompass a wide range of application domains. In fact, Song et al. [6] outlined several advantages of aerial-based wireless backhaul networks, namely, reduced cost, network scalability, easiness to deploy in any area, and guaranteed line-of-sight (LoS) propagation.",

Services may be in the form of hardware, software, storage, platform, infrastructure, database, and many others. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) presented three major categories of services, known as the CC service models, which are: 1) Infrastructure as a service (IaaS), which allows the user to rent computing capabilities, such as storage facilities, networks, processing power, and virtual private servers, on-demand and over the web. These resources are priced using a \"pay as you go\" method where the price is computed based on factors such as how much storage was required or the amount of processing power that was consumed over a specific period. 2) Software as a service (SaaS), in which the cloud provider offers and manages a wide range of applications and software tools that the customers access and execute over the web. SaaS frees the customer from many responsibilities, such as the need for software maintenance, infrastructure administration, data availability, information security, and all the other concerns related to preserving the application in an active and operating state. 3) Platform as a service (PaaS), which combines features from both SaaS and IaaS. In this service model, the cloud platform provides the customer the middleware, database management system, operating system, web server, and development tools. These tools constitute a remote environment where users can develop, build, and execute their software projects without the need to own any hardware or software.",

Owing to the distinctive characteristics of the stratosphere, a HAPS node can remain at a quasi-stationary position. In addition, the HAPS node will be equipped with a flight control system that enables the ground center to control its mobility and direct it towards a certain location whenever needed.

            "text": "Previous research on HAPS focused on utilizing this tech-nology in the areas of ubiquitous connectivity and disaster relief applications. Very recently, a new model was proposed in which the HAPS is considered to be a practical potential for future wireless communication networks [5] . Following the developments in solar panel systems, HAPS nodes can utilize solar power that can be combined with storage batteries as the primary methods for energy supply; HAPS stations possess large surfaces that can house solar panel films. Moreover, because of its low-delay characteristics compared to evolving satellite networks, the HAPS can efficiently offer wireless services to the users of terrestrial networks. The HAPS can have encouraging benefits over other wireless system infrastructures. According to [5] , the low-altitude placement of HAPS, as compared to satellite networks, enables them to make use of better channel conditions and higher signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). In addition, the almost stationary position of HAPS nodes allows full utilization of their capabilities, preventing the existence of a significant Doppler shift and enabling a long airborne duration with marginal energy consumption. Moreover, due to its large volume, a HAPS node is appropriate for multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) and massive-MIMO antenna arrangements. When assisted with multi-antenna arrays, the HAPS node can produce highly directional 3D beams with narrow beamwidths that increase the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) for all users. Finally, due to its relatively low altitudes (as compared to other satellites networks), the HAPS end-to-end delay is estimated to be between 0.13 to 0.33 ms [5] which is favorable for delay-sensitive applications. In general, with large antenna array deployments and low power requirements, the HAPS can support a wide range of fixed and mobile user terminals to satisfy various service demands [8] .",

The authors show that efficient intelligent radio resource and topology management can mitigate intersystem interference and ensure the coexistence of terrestrial systems and HAPS with improved overall system performance. Hence, the ultimate goal of the HAPS network is to enhance the performance and accessibility of current communication systems. This is achieved by supporting a high capacity, comparable to that provided by terrestrial systems, and a wide coverage area, comparable to that provided by satellites.

The HAPS-cloud platform that we propose in this paper is a one step forward towards establishing a framework for offering cloud services from HAPS data centers, which promises to be a vital area for a multitude of future research directions.",

A recent study by \"Research and Markets\" 4 shows that the CC industry is expected to grow from $371.4 Billion in 2020 to $832.1 Billion by 2025.

Several factors play an important role in scalability, such as the computing, storage, and bandwidth demands of the user applications that consume the services of the cloud data center. With the increase in the number of heavy applications that demand high processing, storage, bandwidth, or a combination of the three, the cloud is facing a scalability challenge. In the near future, it is expected that many organizations and institutions such as hospitals, universities, research centers, traffic control centers, etc., will be exploiting the cloud to run big data and AI applications that require specific quality of service (QoS) constraints. In addition, the drastic increase in the utilization of Internet of things (IoT) devices to collect and make use of various sensors' readings has increased the demand for high cloud storage capabilities. Such applications will generate a huge amount of data each second and require frequent and high-complexity computing power to process this data 4 https://www.researchandmarkets.com/r/ys29pn continuously. With the increase in the scalability requirements, cloud providers will look for more and better suitable places to build cloud data centers that can support high processing complexity. The main issue here is that the devices of a cloud data center devour vast amounts of electricity that require a high-cooling process. The high-cooling demand of cloud data centers has driven cloud providers to apply costly solutions, such as deploying data centers deeply underwater or at the earth poles in order to make use of very low temperatures at these locations.",

            "text": "The HAPS network can provide solutions and answers to the two raised questions with optimized design and implementation. First, the HAPS nodes can extensively enhance the cloud scalability by hosting new flying data centers. Exploiting the largely available physical space on the HAPS nodes to deploy powerful data centers will help cloud providers upscale their services and support more user applications. Since the atmospheric temperature at the HAPS elevation is naturally low, in the range of [-15 o C;-50 o C] [5] , there is no need for too much energy for cooling. In addition, due to its location at a high altitude, the HAPS node can provide coverage to a wide ground area (around 500 km radius [5] ). With LoS links between the user devices and the HAPS node, the latter can offer cloud services with satisfiable QoS to users in areas that suffer from poor ground connectivity. Moreover, the HAPS network enables users to avoid several problems that typically occur when consuming cloud services via ground connections, such as the possibility of disconnection while offloading data due to poor channel conditions. For these reasons, it is convenient that cloud providers deploy their services within the HAPS data centers. In addition to the novel HAPS-specific cloud services discussed in the following sections, we expect various traditional cloud services to be deployed on the HAPS nodes. Such services include platform as a service (PaaS), software as a service (SaaS), infrastructure as a service (IaaS), storage as a service (STaaS), and security as a service (SECaaS), among others. Offering such services to various users and businesses further satisfies urgent demands for higher scalability and rapid new cloud resources; it satisfies QoS requirements that ground cloud services fail to achieve. Figure 1 provides an overview of the various HAPS cloud services that we discuss in this paper and the environments in which they are offered and consumed. These services are detailed in the next subsections.",

Satellite As a Service (SATaaS) 1) Overview Satellite services comprise a wide area of applications that can be categorized into three domains: Telecommunications, broadcasting, and data communications. Currently, there are more than 2,500 active satellites that orbit around the Earth, and the number is expected to significantly increase in the upcoming years. Several companies are investigating the use of large low earth orbit (LEO) satellite constellations to improve their services and reach more users; the HAPS network can be deployed as a middle layer between the ground and satellite networks. One of the main advantages of HAPS, as compared to LEO satellites, is their closer proximity to the ground level, and so connecting to them becomes much faster. Therefore, a HAPS constellation-based communication system can overcome the inherent high-latency problem of satellite networks [5] .",

Current satellite services such as global navigation satellite system (GNSS), telephone, broadcasting, and monitoring services (weather, financial, environmental, etc.) can be offloaded from the satellites to the HAPS data centers and then offered to customers with better QoS, such as lower delay or better accuracy (for example, in localization services). In particular, the HAPS data centers can host and execute the server-side code of applications while continuously obtaining input data from various satellite networks. Furthermore, cloud customers can consume these services from the HAPS data centers using suitable CC partitioning and sharing models. In addition, the HAPS infrastructure and equipment could be used to improve the services whenever possible. For example, positioning sensors can be deployed on the HAPS nodes to improve the localization accuracy (much higher resolution than GNSS). Another important reason for offloading satellite services to the HAPS is enabling delay-sensitive applications to obtain the required information from the HAPS cloud service very fast, meeting the strict delay requirements. Such applications cannot afford the delay of obtaining information from satellites in traditional services. Therefore, deploying satellite services on the HAPS cloud, as opposed to consuming the service directly from the satellite network, allows application users to enjoy a higher QoS.",

A group of IoT sensors that monitor a particular place or environment could be connected to a HPAS gateway that frequently aggregates the sensors' readings and transmits them to the HAPS node. This setup is similar to the current setup in wireless sensor networks (WSNs), except that WSN gateways connect to the cloud via a base station or a dedicated wired connection [16] . In some situations, it is hard to secure a reliable Internet connection for WSN gateways, especially when WSNs are deployed in rural locations, deep inside forests or deserts, or on top of high mountains. In such cases, dedicating a robust LoS connection between WSN gateways and HAPS nodes guarantees fast offloading of the WSN data to the HAPS cloud, and hence better QoS to users. In addition, HAPS nodes are expected to have high storage capacities [5] that help various types of WSNs overcoming the limited storage problem in their local servers, thus enhancing these networks' applications performance. Furthermore, in scenarios where the WSN location is not covered by any HAPS node, tethered balloons (TBs) can be used to connect the WSN (and other ground users and networks) to the HAPS network. TBs were proposed in several works as a means for connecting multiple ground sources [17, 18] . As shown in Fig. 1 , in the absence of HAPS connectivity, TBs play an essential role in connecting the ground users and networks to the HAPS cloud. Several TBs can be placed in rural areas to connect to each other and connect via one or more TBs to the HAPS network. This solution is economically more feasible than placing HAPS nodes in rural areas.",

Several recent works emphasized the fact that vehicular networks in future smart cities are expected to generate continuous streams of big data that require continuously increasing storage and very fast processing [22] , [23] . Various ITS applications could be partially or entirely offloaded to the HAPS network and offered as cloud services to ITS administrators and customers. Consequently, various vehicular network nodes could offload their data to the HAPS cloud via multiple strategies. For example, some roadside units (RSUs) could be integrated with HAPS communication modules to establish a high-speed LoS connection to the HAPS network and support a high data rate for vehicular big data offloading. These RSUs can be deployed in high locations such as the top of buildings to enhance their connectivity with the HAPS network. Using such setups, the vehicular network can make use of the ground RSU-to-RSU (also denoted as infrastructure to infrastructure or I2I) connections to aggregate and transfer various ITS applications' data to RSUs, which in turn transmit the data to the HAPS network. Another possible solution is to equip certain types of vehicles that act as mobile gateways (such as buses) with HAPS communication modules. Such strategies create fast connection lines between the vehicular and the HAPS networks, enabling the former to use the latter's storage and processing capabilities.

Their framework mainly focuses on disaster and emergency scenarios. In particular, a UAV node captures videos of its environment and passes them to a context scheduler that analyzes the video frames based on several context data such as location, spatial and temporal data, and control commands in order to decide on the parts of the video data that should be offloaded to a cloud server. The authors in [25] further propose a combined cloudfog architecture for UAVs in which several UAV nodes are chosen as fog coordinators.

However, in rural areas, seas, oceans, or deserts, the drones might not have the means to connect via a ground gateway; the HAPS nodes can act as the gateway. Similar to the discussion in the previous section, we note that UAV nodes can be equipped with HAPS communication modules that enable them to establish a LoS connection with a HAPS node. Consequently, the UAV nodes with a HAPS connection can collect, filter, and aggregate various data from other UAV nodes and offload this data to the HAPS cloud data center. Cloud users then consume the UAV services by connecting to the HAPS data center and executing the corresponding service. This setup enables cloud users to connect to UAVs positioned in weakly connected or disconnected locations. UAV cloud services enable the cloud users to analyze the UAV sensors' readings to monitor or study the UAV area and command the UAV nodes to move to certain locations or perform specific tasks. In addition, UAVs deployed in weakly connected or disconnected areas enable users to connect to the cloud via the UAV-HAPS connection. Even in scenarios where the UAV has ground connectivity, UAV applications that require large storage and processing overheads can still offload their data and code to the HAPS cloud instead of the ground cloud due to the advantages of the former, such as better connection and channel conditions, lower latency, etc. These advantages mostly appear when the UAVs encounter obstacles (emergencies that affect the ground infrastructure such as fire or floods, for example) or are deployed in obstructed areas.

This is especially true for very large wireless networks that contain tens or hundreds of thousands of nodes, such as huge WSNs or IoVs that generate continuous streams of routing data that should be sent to the SDN controller. Note that there should be an efficient filtering and aggregation procedure in such networks to enable the wireless network nodes to filter redundant data and group important data before sending them to the HAPS SDN controller.",

Many reasons cause connection loss in these networks, such as high interference and/or noise, the existence of blocking objects (WSNs that are deployed in rural and environmentchanging areas), and high mobility of highway vehicles which does not leave vehicles enough time to send packets to the RSU. Suppose these nodes are equipped with a HAPS communication module or connected to other nodes with HAPS communication modules (such as TBs). In that case, we can avoid the network isolation problem that occurs when one or more SDN switches cannot reach the SDN controller.",

Mobility is an important characteristic that provides great advantages to networks, but at the same time creates several problems, such as dynamic topology and intermittent connectivity, complex modulation and coding, handoff, road traffic congestion (in vehicular networks), etc. Several research works proposed mobility management systems for mobile networks. For example, the authors of [35] propose a mobility model that is implemented within a vehicular cloud platform. The proposed model makes use of free flow and queuing-up movements of vehicles to suggest an alternate route for the driver which is free from traffic. Another model for calculating and managing the trajectories of drones in UAVs is proposed in [36] . Here, the drone routes are estimated via the global GPS reference system with supporting GIS mapping, coupled with autonomous conflict detection, resolution, safe drone following, and formation flight options.",

The server can then build a movement profile for each mobile node by analyzing the mentioned parameters during a certain time period; such data can be used to predict future movements and network changes. The server can dynamically re-execute the ML algorithms when the inputs change (upon nodes entering and leaving, speed and acceleration changes, weather changes, etc.). MMaaS can overcome many of the problems mentioned above by producing a future movement trajectory for each mobile node to guarantee that the network continues to operate normally. For example, if the nodes' movement profiles indicate that part of the WSN will be isolated from the network if the nodes retain their movement pattern, the MMaaS can adjust the future movement paths of one or more nodes to guarantee that no sub-network isolation occurs. Another example is vehicular traffic control. Although many efforts have been made in road traffic control and traffic congestion avoidance, road traffic is still causing huge problems, especially in high-urban areas. HAPS nodes can combine the data that we mention in this paragraph with highresolution images that they can take and that show the exact concentration of vehicles on the roads, the exact locations of accidents, and the existence of temporary obstacles on certain roads. When combining and analyzing all this data, the HAPS nodes can predict the future traffic patterns of the vehicles and advise each driver to follow a specific path to resolve expected future traffic congestion and balance the traffic on all the paths to a particular destination.",

Several research works discussed the benefits of cloud-gaming platforms in improving the performance of end-user games and creating a network architecture for a high QoS multiplayer cooperative cloud gaming [37, 38, 39] . With HAPS in the picture, cloud gamers' devices can be equipped with high-speed HAPS communication modules that allow the gamers to connect to the HAPS cloud from their devices. Using this setup, players can run the front-end of the game on their devices, and the devices could connect to the back-end of the game application on the nearest HAPS node. In addition, the HAPS nodes can collaborate to run the games in parallel between large groups of gamers and balance the load within the HAPS network. This setup enables gamers to play various single and multiplayer games that are hosted on the HAPS cloud. Several cloud platforms, such as Vortex 11 ; Shadow 12 ; and Amazon Luna, 13 are currently offering similar services on the ground cloud. The main advantage that HAPS offer to cloud gamers is that each HAPS node has a large footprint, allowing mobile gamers to guarantee a stable connection to the same HAPS node for a large period of time and avoid the frequent handoff problem that decreases the QoS of the current cellular systems.",

Instead of linking people based on social relations, businesses create interactive societies that group persons based on common business desires or practices. The social cloud is proposed in [40] , enabling cloud users to share heterogeneous resources from multiple cloud services within the context of a social network. The social cloud comprises a social marketplace that utilizes both social and economic protocols to manage the sharing of resources and facilitate trading between users. In general, social networking cloud services have been used in the context of many fields, such as healthcare ( [41] ), education ( [42] ), sharing of cloud resources ( [46] ), and media ( [43] ). In the future, HAPS nodes can host cloud data centers dedicated to social network cloud applications. The HAPS social network data center could include servers for implementing and managing the SN security, storage, applications, communications, backup, policies, etc. Similar to what we stated in Sec. II-G2, the devices of the SN users would use a dedicated HAPS communication module to connect to the HAPS network, log in to the SN, and consume the desired services. Each HAPS node will connect to other HAPS nodes and to the ground data centers of the SN to enable its users to utilize various resources within the SN. The HAPS SN can offer several advantages as compared to current cloud social services, such as extra computational power, lower userto-cloud and user-to-user delays (most probably in rural and weak connectivity areas, where users can connect to the HAPS either directly or via TBs), and better channel conditions.",

Such networks are a mere abstraction of integrated satellites at the GEO-layer (i.e., GEO-satellites), LEO-layer (i.e., cubesats), stratospheric layer (i.e., HAPS and hot-air balloons), and aeronautical layer (i.e., low-altitude platform systems (LAPS) and UAVs), all inter-and intra-connected for better serving the ground-level communications infrastructures. Not only would the end-toend utility function of such VHetNets depend on their highly coupled interactions and mutual dynamics, but it is also a strong function of the ever-changing environmental conditions across the different layers. For example, for systems where the downlink transmission from the upper satellites layers to the HAPS are done via FSO links, the system performance becomes a strong function of the impacts of component failure and atmospheric conditions, e.g., turbulence, fog, and rain [53, 54] . Likewise, the connection from the HAPS layer to the ground level base stations becomes a function of the nature of the backhaul (RF or FSO) and its surrounding environmental conditions. For example, Grace et al. [55] study the effect of the HAPS node displacement on the received signal power. They show that the antenna type (fixed or steerable) at the ground station greatly affects the system performance when the HAPS node is displaced from its location. The authors state that steerable antennas are of most use when ground stations are immediately below the HAPS node, with no benefit for stations that are on the edge of coverage.",

One possible solution is to combine multiple spectrum enablers such as microwave, mmWave, terahertz (THz), and FSO communications. Each of these technologies has its advantages and disadvantages. On the one hand, lower-frequency microwave communications support longer communication distances and wider coverage, both of which are critical for the HAPS operation in the access domain. On the other hand, higherfrequency mmWave and THz communications support much higher data rates which are critical for the HAPS operation in the backhaul domain. Since extending the communication distance of mmWave/THz requires, given the high path and absorption losses, high antenna and beamforming gains, the corresponding beamwidths are usually narrow, reducing coverage and intensifying the misalignment effect. Nevertheless, in quasi-static HAPS deployments, such links can still be established. Note that the particular use of THz communications motivates the merging of communications, localization, and sensing applications for HAPS operations [56] . Furthermore, THz links can be used inside HAPS-deployed data centers [57] , where the environment can be perfectly controlled to remove molecular components that result in significant THz absorption losses. Such wireless links in data centers can significantly reduce the complications of wired connectivity within the HAPS, which is hard to maintain and incurs an extra weight factor that can not be neglected in flying platforms.",

In general, the cloud customer tends to choose the service that better satisfies his/her specific QoS requirements.

In brief, availability is related to the overall percentage of time during which a service is available, reliability is related to several factors such as functioning adequately; producing correct outputs; and resisting failures, response time is the period between when a customer makes a request and a response is returned, scalability (sometimes called capacity) is related to the volume (or load) that a service can handle while maintaining standards of quality and performance, elasticity is the ability to increase/decrease the amount of service resources (such as CPU; storage; memory; and input/output bandwidth) on demand, and fairness is related to assigning correct priorities to customers and servicing them fairly based on their priorities in order to achieve overall customer satisfaction. On the other hand, several papers [60, 61] discussed the QoS from the HAPS perspective and illustrated the various methods that can enhance the QoS of the HAPS communications and deployment.",

This can be realized by installing HAPS gateways at high locations (such as the top of buildings) and establishing a high-speed connection between the users' devices and the HAPS gateways. However, this cannot always be guaranteed, especially when the user consumes the service from a mobile device. When the user is mobile, the connection to the HAPS might be weak or lost in specific locations (such as underground tunnels), which decreases the availability of the HAPS cloud service.

The authors identify seven main requirements of cloud security: Confidentiality, integrity, availability, authentication, authorization, accountability, and privacy. The main threats that should be considered by cloud providers when designing a strong security framework are related to data breaches, account hijacking and identity theft, system and code vulnerabilities, malicious users, abuse utilization of services, and denial of service (DoS). Furthermore, the authors identify possible solutions to these threats, including encryption frameworks to manage identities, keys, and signatures, intrusion detection and prevention systems, software and virtual environment security, network security, storage security, physical and hardware security, and trust management systems. The various types of attacks that could be performed on the cloud framework, services, and users are identified in [66] ; they can be summarized as: DoS, service injection, userto-root, virtualization, man-in-the-middle, phishing, metadata spoofing, and backdoor channel attacks.",

In addition, when applying the blockchain to the cloud, the cloud transactions' data are encrypted, distributed across the blockchain nodes, and interconnected via a hashing function [71] . Hence, it becomes difficult for attackers to interfere with the transactions' data due to the consensus mechanism of the blockchain. The authors of [73] propose using a convolution neural network (CNN) to analyze the cloud traffic data, detect and identify sensitive data patterns, and determine for each new data flow whether it belongs to normal or abnormal activities. Furthermore, a collaborative privacy-preserving ML architecture for healthcare systems is presented in [74] . The proposed mechanism provides important solutions to several challenges that exist in ML-based ubiquitous healthcare applications. Applying deep learning over cloud data encrypted under multiple keys is further proposed in [75] . In this approach, the cloud provider migrates the users' data that are encrypted with the users' keys to the deep learning training model, and the latter trains the model using the stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithm and performs the feed-forward and back-propagation procedures based on a privacy-preserving calculation toolkit.",

Hence, we aim to design and implement a routing protocol that calculates the optimal routing path from a source to a destination HAPS node based on the routing requirement. The latter could be the minimum delay (which is achieved by selecting the shortest path that contains the minimum average distance between adjacent HAPS nodes), the highest QoS (for instance, delivering the data with high accuracy), the least energy consumption (for low priority messages), etc. In addition, the routing algorithm monitors the connections between the HAPS nodes and the surrounding networks and suggests to the HAPS control center adjusting the location of one or more HAPS nodes in order to maintain or enhance the various connections between the HAPS network and the satellite, UAV, TBs, and ground networks. Since some of these latter networks are mobile, the HAPS connection to one or more external networks could be lost under mobility.

The model utilizes blockchain capabilities to encrypt/decrypt all the data exchanged between cloud users and providers. In particular, the model can include two blockchains: The first is a distributed ledger that securely saves all financial transactions in the cloud. Each financial transaction is encrypted by the public key of the receiving HAPS node and added to the next block. The HAPS nodes constitute the blockchain miners that generate the blockchain blocks. In order to do that, the HAPS nodes will execute a consensus model in which one of the HAPS nodes is selected as the current miner that generates the next block. The role of the current miner alternates between the HAPS nodes. Each HAPS node validates each financial transaction it receives from the customers and sends it to the current miner. A new block is generated each period T block . When the current miner generates the new block, it broadcasts it to the HAPS nodes and waits for their acknowledgments. Each HAPS node checks the validity of the transactions in the new block by validating the signature of the cloud customer(s) who made the transaction. If all transactions are valid, the HAPS node sends an acknowledgment to the current miner. When the current miner receives acknowledgments from TH C nodes (where TH C is a threshold determined by the consensus algorithm), it considers the new block valid and broadcasts its ID to the HAPS network so that all nodes add it to the blockchain. In this way, all financial transactions within the HAPS cloud services are saved securely in the cloud ledger. A similar model for the IoV was presented in [76] .",

In addition, this ID will be linked to the actual data that is encrypted and saved in the cloud distributed database. The data could be hashed hierarchically in multiple iterations if it is too big. Hence, the hash of each data transaction will be saved in the data blockchain for future reference.

In that case, the ML algorithm should be able to detect the attack from the behavior of the nodes in the blockchain network.

Reinforcement learning matches services in absence of a priori knowledge and a sufficiently large amount of training data. However, they suffer from a major drawback: high calculation cost because an optimal solution requires that all states be visited to choose the optimal one. Thus, this tradeoff must be carefully considered when implementing reinforcement learning in certain environments. As shown in [79] , support vector machine (SVM) based learning outperforms deep learning in terms of computation time for training in the experiment of predicting the next location of a user, considering the associated delays. However, deep learning wins by far in predicting the number of users located in a certain location. Deep learning requires 27 mins to train while SVM consumed 6 days for training [79] .
