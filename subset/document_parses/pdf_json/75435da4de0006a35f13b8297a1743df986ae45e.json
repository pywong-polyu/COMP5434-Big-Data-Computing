In the first half of 2020 COVID-19 has spread around the world, infecting millions of people, killing hundreds of thousands, and inflicting significant economic damage. As of this writing, the future of this pandemic is still unclear. While there are signs that is it subsiding, at least in some parts of the world, it is still expanding in others and possibly coming back into areas it already affected. One of the biggest unknowns is how the pandemic would change in time. We already know that the virus is mutating and evolving into separate clades with distinct geographical and time distribution (https://www.gisaid.org) [1] . This is fairly typical for RNA viruses and it cannot be automatically interpreted as a sign that the disease it is causing is changing [2] , but the first epidemiological data indicating that more transmissible viral strains are emerging [3] and preliminary experimental analyses hinting at such changes have appeared [4, 5] . The SARS-CoV-2 virus evolution is hotly debated in the scientific and the popular press [6] and has spawned a massive effort to sequence the viral variants from all over the world. A quickly growing list of complete SARS-CoV-2 genomes is maintained by resources such as GISAID [1] (https://www.gisaid.org). According to the phylogenetic analysis of this data on this site, as of early June 2020, at least six major clades: S, L, V, G, GH, and GR were identified. These clades have very uneven geographical and time distribution. For instance, most of the variants present at the beginning of the epidemic do not exist anymore; the S clade was most common in January and February 2020, while clades G, GH, and GR appeared only in February, but now constitute over 75% of new cases (https://www.gisaid.org). Over 78% of the North American isolates belong to GH (now) and S clades (early) and over 65% of isolates from the EU belong to G and GR clades.

One may naturally expect that adaptation to a new host would provide evolutionary pressure on the virus and lead to positive selection visible in the genome, but our understanding of processes leading to the emergence of new RNA viruses suggests otherwise [7] . The observed mutation pattern is most likely a result of genetic drift combined with geographical separations of localized outbreaks and the differences between the expansion of different clades are mostly due to a series of local founder's mutations. But, at the same time, there is no doubt that the SARS-CoV-2 evolution, again typical for all RNA viruses [8] , is strongly influenced by negative (purifying) selection that removes nonviable viruses [9] . Negative or purifying selection can provide information about genes' or protein regions' essentiality, but in general, it receives less attention than positive selection.

Many of SARS-CoV-2 proteins, such as nsp3 or N protein, can be further divided into independently folding regions with specific functions. In the following analysis, we compared the observed number of missense mutations in a given protein or its region with the expected number of missense mutations under an appropriate background frequency, to identify regions that are significantly over or under mutated (see Methods). Because domain assignment is not complete for SARS-CoV-2 proteins, we use information on structurally characterized constructs to define boundaries of structural (and functional) domains or regions.

Analysis of genomic mutations on the amino acid level has a long history in the field of cancer genomics, where cancer mutations have been shown to often have clearly non-random distribution when mapped on protein sequences and structures [21] . In it worth noting that similar effects are very strong in cancer genomes where a tendency of locally increased mutation frequency is typically interpreted as a signal of positive selection and used to identify cancer driver genes and mutations.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 682, "end": 686, "text": "[21]", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Some SARS-CoV-2 proteins and domains show significant differences in the frequency of mutations"}, {"text": "While apparent excess of mutations in specific proteins or protein regions could be caused by positive selection, and dearth of them by negative one, this would only be true with the constant \"background\" mutation rate across the entire genome. With this rate undergoing significant fluctuations that appear to be random but show some dependence on the position along the genome, differences in these rates can also contribute to the excess or deficiency in the number of mutations. Therefore, in this analysis, we used different background frequencies for the different parts of the proteome being analyzed (see Methods). Table 1 presents the significant results of the analysis on individual proteins (16 nonstructural proteins and 10 structural ones) and Table 2 the results for individual functional domains and their subdomains as identified from the structural analysis. Results for both using a uniform mutation baseline and the different backgrounds for the structural and non-structural proteins are shown. The full table is available in the Supplementary Table S1. As seen from Table 1 , most SARS-CoV-2 proteins do not show evidence of any selection pressure and their mutation pattern is consistent with that resulting from genomic drift. Only three proteins show statistically significant deficiency of mutations as compared to the background, specifically the spike protein (S protein), Membrane glycoprotein (M protein) and nsp12 (RNA polymerase). Nine proteins show statistically significant surplus of mutations as compared to the background. Table 1 . SARS-CoV-2 proteins with frequency of mutations significantly different from the background (proteome).

From the three under mutated proteins, only one (nsp12) shows a significant result for both models of background mutations. In this case, it is possible to argue that it is the effect of purifying selection due to the functional importance of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) for the SARS-CoV-2 biology. It is an interesting contrast with nsp2, which shows a statistically significant excess of mutations, again with both background mutation models. Nsp1 protein comes close, with a low, but above threshold p-value. Functions for both these proteins are unknown, but both are not directly involved in viral replication and are not essential for the in vitro reproduction. Other proteins with the relative excess of mutations (orf3a, orf8b, and orf14) are all involved in viral-host interactions.

As domains within multidomain proteins often have their independent evolutionary history and are identifiable, individual functions, differences in mutation ratios of different domains may provide a more detailed picture of their relative importance for the virus viability. We have used a similar approach in the eDriver algorithm used to identify the role of individual domains in cancer driver proteins [15] . The domain and subdomain structures of SARS-CoV-2 proteins can be identified in two steps. First, the expression of various constructs from individual proteins allowed researchers to recognize fragments that could fold independently and often can be assigned specific functions. Three-dimensional structures of many of these domains have been determined, so here we use the mapping of the SARS-CoV-2 proteins into the PDB structures/models as a proxy for domain identification (Table 2) .

The Bonferroni corrected significance threshold is 0.0018. \"n/s\" -p-values not significant even before the correction. Pvalues indicating significance are shown in bold font. We also looked at regions in between the solved structures/models, assuming that these would form domains whose structures remain unsolved ( Figure 2 and Table 2 ). In the second step, we analyzed the experimental structures and models of SARS-CoV-2 proteins to identify subdomains within them ( Table 3 ). The complete list of domains found in SARS-CoV-2 proteins is provided in the Supplemental Material section. Full results on relative excess or dearth of mutations in all domains and subdomains are presented in Supplementary Tables S2 and S3 . There are only two cases where individual domains in one protein have a statistically significant difference in mutations ratios. The structured regions in the N (nucleocapsid) protein (see Figure 2A ) -the RNA binding domain and the dimerization domain (PDB IDs 6vyo and 6wji, respectively), are significantly less mutated than the remaining parts of the nucleocapsid protein. This effect could be probably explained by the rest of the nucleocapsid protein (including the region between the two domains) being partly disordered and such regions are typically much more tolerant of mutation. (for the detailed discussion of mutation rate in different parts of Nucleocapsid protein -see the section Significantly lower mutation frequency in the region of overlapping reading frames). The second, more interesting example is the SUD (SARS Unique Domain) region of nsp3, which consists a tandem repeat of two subdomains with a macrodomain fold and the second repeat has a significantly smaller number of mutations. Interestingly, despite strong structural similarity between the repeats, there is no obvious sequence similarity between them, suggesting that the duplication happened a relatively long time ago. These two domains cooperatively bind specific RNA structures (G-Quadruplexes) with the N-and C-terminal half playing a different role in the binding [22] . Experiments have shown that mutations in the predicted RNA biding grove in the C-terminal domain completely abolish RNA binding, while the mutations in the N-terminal domain barely affect it.

Systematic analyses suggest that combined negative selection on two reading frames results in decreased frequency of all mutations as mutations synonymous in one reading frame may be missense (and potentially deleterious) in another reading frame [24] . The N-terminal part of the Nucleocapsid gene of SARS-CoV-2 is translated into two different reading frames resulting in an additional gene coding for a functional protein ORF9b. A similar overlapping reading frame is suggested for the region coding for ORF14. We tested the frequency of mutations in the region of the Nucleocapsid protein which is coding for two proteins in two different reading frames and compared the mutation frequency in this region to the background frequency for the entire gene confirming the expected result (see Figure 4) . However, the decrease in the frequency of mutations is only observed in the region where proteins coded in two reading frames have well-defined structures. The N-terminal region of the Nucleocapsid gene does not have an experimental structure and is predicted to be structurally disordered and, as such, is expected to impose less constraint on mutations [25] .

To this end, we collected the sequences of primers and probes commonly used for COVID-19 diagnostic PCR assays.

In general, primer target regions corresponding to stable, experimentally verified protein structures showed lower mutation rates and prevalence (virus counts) than structurally uncharacterized and potentially unstructured regions.
