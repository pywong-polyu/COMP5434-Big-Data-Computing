Overall and disease-free survival of breast cancer patients were both improved by the early detection and introduction of targeted therapy and immune checkpoint inhibitors in combination with conventional treatment modalities [1] . Nonetheless, breast cancer-related death remains high mainly due to drug resistance and metastasis [2] , thus stressing the need for better understanding of breast cancer biology to develop more effective targeted therapies. Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) accounts for 12-20% of all breast cancer subtypes [3] . Compared to other breast cancer subtypes, TNBC has the most aggressive behavior with high recurrence rate and worst outcome [4] . This has been mainly attributed to limited therapeutic options due to lack of biomarkers or valid treatment targets. Therefore, identification of biomarkers or signaling pathways that are differentially enriched in TNBC could potentially expand our knowledge and accelerate therapeutic development with the aim to hinder or slow the disease progression.",

Moreover, it was reported to regulate adhesion and filopodia formation in migrating cancer cells [6] . Inhibition of fascin using RNA interference reduced the number of filopodia and disrupted the organization of the actin bundles [7, 8] . Fascin expression is induced in many transformed epithelial cells including breast, and its expression level is considered a biomarker of worst clinical outcome [9] [10] [11] [12] . Fascin expression was reported in high percentage (87.8%) of TNBC as compared to the other breast cancer subtypes [13] and thus has been proposed as a diagnostic marker for TNBC and potential therapeutic target [13] [14] [15] . Most importantly, fascin inhibitors were shown to block TNBC metastasis in tumor metastasis mouse model [16] [17] [18] and to reduce the growth of specific TNBC, which express high levels of epidermal growth factor receptor [18, 19] . We have previously reported a crucial role for fascin in regulating drug resistance [20] and metastasis [9] and have identified several underlying mechanisms that have contributed in this process [21] [22] [23] . More inclusive studies are needed to identify enriched molecular signature in fascin-positive TNBC for potential therapeutic targeting.",

Herein, we carried a comprehensive transcriptome analysis on fascin knockdown TNBC cell line (MDA-MB-231) in comparison to their fascin-expressing counterparts. Results from our fascin knockdown cells showed enrichment of genes that promoted disease progression in fascin-positive breast cancer cells. Collectively, this study provides more comprehensive understanding of the oncogenic role of fascin and its effectors, which might represent valuable tumor biomarkers and therapeutic targets for TNBC.

A large cohort of breast cancer patients from the publicly available Kaplan-Meier plotter portal dataset [24] was used to assess fascin expression and its impact on overall survival (OS; n = 1879), recurrence-free survival (RFS; n = 4929) and distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS; n = 2764). Remarkable increase in fascin expression was observed in the breast cancer cohort (n = 7569) compared to samples from the normal group (n = 242) ( Figure 1A) . Furthermore, metastatic patients (n = 82) exhibited higher expression of fascin as compared to the normal group. Concordantly, FSCN1 high breast cancer patients showed the worst OS, RFS and DMFS as compared to FSCN1 low group ( Figure 1B-D) . Importantly, the power of significance (p value) between FSCN1 high and FSCN1 low groups increased from 0.0059 in OS to 1.9 \u00d7 10 \u22126 and 3.3 \u00d7 10 \u22125 for RFS and DMFS, respectively. These data emphasize the role of fascin not only in predicting the OS, but its contribution to RFS and DMFS, making it useful biomarker for assessing the prognosis of the disease. publicly available Kaplan-Meier plotter portal dataset [24] was used to assess fascin expression and its impact on overall survival (OS; n = 1879), recurrence-free survival (RFS; n = 4929) and distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS; n = 2764).

To identify putative markers that are selectively associated with high fascin expression, we have used the publicly available breast cancer patients' gene expression dataset from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA; n = 1217). These data were subjected to marker discovery analysis comparing FSCN1 high (n = 534) vs. FSCN1 low (n = 545). FSCN1 high group showed enrichment in genes that are involved in regulating many cellular processes such as the extracellular matrix organization, stress fibers, biological adhesion, actin binding and posttranslational protein folding ( Figure 1E ). On the contrary, FSCN1 low group showed enrichment of genes that are involved in regulation of other cellular process such as small GTPase mediated signal transduction, negative regulation of gene expression and endoplasmic reticulum. The top 60 enriched genes in FSCN1 high vs. FSCN1 low breast cancer patients from TCGA dataset were then subjected for network analysis using AltAnalyze software to construct protein-protein interaction. These data showed nodes with evidence of protein-protein interaction ( Figure 2 ). Some of the enriched (such as VIM and NOTCH1) and reduced (such as ESR) genes in FSCN1 high groups are consistent with our previous results [9, 23] . These data establish that the level of fascin expression in breast cancer samples is associated with differentially expressed genes that regulate key cellular process and promote disease progression.

The rectangle dimension indicates the associated functions that are predicted to be most significantly affected. The color intensity indicates higher absolute Z-scores, where blue and orange reflects decrease and increase, respectively. Functional categories associated with cellular movement and invasion as well as cell growth and proliferation were enriched, while those associated with cellular development as well as cell death and survival were diminished in FSCN1 CON cells. In agreement with those data, in vitro live assays showed reduced migration, invasion, proliferation, and adhesion in our FSCN1 KD breast cancer cells ( Figure 5B -E). Further upstream regulator analysis using IPA showed activated GLI1, CBX5 and TRIB3 ( Figure 5F ) and suppressed EZH2 and ATF4 ( Figure 5G ) networks in FSCN1 KD breast cancer cells. Collectively, these data demonstrated association between the differentially regulated transcripts in FSCN1 KD compared to FSCN1 CON MDA-MB-231 cells and increase in cell proliferation, migration, while the cell death-associated functional categories were suppressed.

Figure 5A showed rectangles with different color code, dimension and intensity that indicate a family of associated biological functions or diseases. The rectangle dimension indicates the associated functions that are predicted to be most significantly affected. The color intensity indicates higher absolute Z-scores, where blue and orange reflects decrease and increase, respectively. Functional categories associated with cellular movement and invasion as well as cell growth and proliferation were enriched, while those associated with cellular development as well as cell death and survival were diminished in FSCN1 CON cells. In agreement with those data, in vitro live assays showed reduced migration, invasion, proliferation, and adhesion in our FSCN1 KD breast cancer cells ( Figure 5B -E). Further upstream regulator analysis using IPA showed activated GLI1, CBX5 and TRIB3 ( Figure 5F ) and suppressed EZH2 and ATF4 ( Figure 5G ) networks in FSCN1 KD breast cancer cells. Collectively, these data demonstrated association between the differentially regulated transcripts in FSCN1 KD compared to FSCN1 CON MDA-MB-231 cells and increase in cell proliferation, migration, while the cell death-associated functional categories were suppressed.

The fact that proteins identified based on differential gene expression from TCGA dataset are from breast cancer patients, which include various cell types, while those identified from FSCN1 KD are from cell line data may explain this inconsistency between the two lists. The decrease in ESR and the increase in NOTCH1 and VIM that was observed in FSCN1 high group of BCRA cohort from the TCGA database are in line with our previous results, which demonstrated promotion of NOTCH1 and VIM by fascin [9, 23] .

Enrichment of CCND2 in TNBC especially post neoadjuvant chemotherapy [34] is consistent with its increased expression in our FSCN1 CON . Similarly, the over-expression of MAL2 in TNBC and its contribution to immune evasion and poorer survival [35] supports our finding of increased expression of MAL2 in FSCN1 CON . The elevated level of TIMP4 in early stage estrogen receptornegative breast cancer and association with poorer clinical outcome [36] is consistent with the finding of increased expression of TIMP4 in FSCN1 CON . On the other hand, the decreased expression of APOBEC3G in our FSCN1 CON compared to FSCN1 KD is consistent with positive correlation between its increased expression and favorable prognosis in TNBC [37] . In addition, the decreased expression of KRTAP2-4 in FSCN1 CON is consistent with its downregulation by miRNA-200c in TNBC to promote metastasis and reduce survival [38] . There is association between high expression of HLA-DRB1 with increased tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and therapeutic response in TNBC [39] consistent with its reduced expression in our FSCN1 CON . No known function for TENM-1 in TNBC, but if it serves a tumor suppressor role like what has been suggested for TENM2 in various type of tumors [40] then that is consistent with the decreased expression in our FSCN1 CON .

            "text": "Deregulated expression of miRNAs has been implicated in regulating many diseases including cancer. For example, miRNA-145 is under-expressed in various tumors including breast and is considered to be a tumor suppressor gene due to its inhibitory effect on tumor cell proliferation, invasion, and metastasis [41] . High miRNA-145 expression has also been reported to increase tumor cell sensitivity to chemotherapy. Importantly, miRNA-145 was reported to target fascin and inhibit metastasis or invasion in many cancer types including colorectal [42] , nasopharyngeal [43] , gastric [44] and non-small-cell lung cancer [45] . Our findings of repressed miRNA-145, increased migration, invasion, proliferation and adhesion in our FSCN1 CON TNBC may explain the poor prognosis and shorter survival. The expression level of miRNA-145 following treatment of TNBC with fascin inhibitors has not been assessed [16] [17] [18] , which could validate the miRNA-145 repression by fascin. miRNA-145 was also predicted to regulate several other genes in our FSCN1 KD model. Similarly, the reduced expression of miRNA-205 in our FSCN1 CON TNBC is consistent with previous study, where its upregulation was reported to inhibit proliferation, cell cycle progression and tumor growth [46] . The increase expression of the onco-suppressor miRNA-424 in our FSCN1 CON TNBC is consistent with its association with aggressive state including advanced clinical stage, tumor size and distance metastases [47] . The increase expression of miRNA-200c in our FSCN1 CON TNBC is consistent with its role in promoting migration and invasiveness of TNBC [48] . Moreover, the increase expression of miRNA-27b in our fascin expressing TNBC is consistent with its role in regulating migration and association with poor clinical outcome [49] . Of the differentially regulated miRNAs upon fascin knockdown in TNBC, miRNA-145, miRNA-205, miRNA-424, miRNA-200c, miRNA-27b may explain the aggressive behavior of fascin-expressing TNBC. The remaining identified miRNA-mRNA networks in the FSCN1 KD model and their plausible role in driving TNBC progression warrants further investigation.",

However, fascin involvement in regulating many other signaling pathways remained largely unexplored and the results reported in this study should stimulate further investigations toward this direction. For example, one could speculate that fascin, via its actin bundling activity, may act as scaffold to promote or suppress complex formation between interacting partners. While the exact mechanism of fascin regulation of the differentially expressed transcripts in this study are not elucidated, these findings shed lights on the oncogenic effect of fascin in promoting disease progression particularly in TNBC via modulating other biomarkers and signaling pathways. Therefore, targeting fascin or its associated network may present a novel therapeutic window as single or in combination with other treatment modalities for better clinical outcome.",
