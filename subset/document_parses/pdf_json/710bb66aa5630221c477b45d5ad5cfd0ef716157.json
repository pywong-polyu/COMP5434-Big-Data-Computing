High levels of IL-6 have been associated with the development of severe disease [24, 25] and acute respiratory distress syndrome [8] during COVID-19 infection, but the role of inflammation markers in COVID-19-induced-AKI remains speculative [7] . The deleterious role of IL-6 has been demonstrated in different models of AKI, including ischemic AKI, nephrotoxin-induced AKI and sepsis-induced AKI [26, 27] . In our study, IL-6 and ferritin levels correlated with severity but were not independently associated with AKI. The complement system represents the first response of the host immune system. It participates in the development of AKI [28] and has also been suspected to play a role in AKI in the context of SARS-CoV-2 infection [10, 12] . Recent studies showed a strong immunohistochemical staining of complement cascade components in the lungs [29] and kidneys [30] of severe COVID-19 patients. However, even if C3 levels were associated with AKI severity in univariate analysis, the association did not persist when forced into a multivariate model, and soluble C5b9 showed no association with AKI. C3 level was only independently associated with AKI stage 2 and 3 compared to no AKI or AKI stage 1. Overall, our results do not support a role for complement dysregulation in COVID-19-induced-AKI, even though complement dysregulation may be involved in the most severe forms of AKI.",

Last, high levels of PEEP in COVID-19 patients [34, 35] have also been suggested as a potential factor for increased AKI in severe COVID-19 patients [36] . In our study, PEEP levels were not independently associated with the development of AKI, but the lack of statistical power and longitudinal data on PEEP levels does not allow for any definite conclusion.",

            "text": "Our study also has limitations. First, despite being the largest focusing on COVID-19-induced-AKI in the ICU, the limited number of patients can translate into a lack of statistical power. Nevertheless, rate of AKI and sample size allow confirming a high AKI incidence with a reasonable level of confidence (81%; 95% CI 72-89). In addition, the monocenter design may have limited external validity of our findings. The proportion of missing baseline serum creatinine value (67%) may also be an issue. Missing baseline creatinine value is a common problem in research focusing on AKI, and although most studies do not report the proportion of missing baseline values, rates as high as 85% are common [22] . We provide sensitivity analyses (Additional file 1: Figure S3 and Table S2 ) to show that back calculation of missing baseline creatinine values unlikely results in a significant bias. Last, lack of association between inflammation biomarker, IL-6 or complement component do not preclude participation of these mechanisms to AKI. They only underline that in this setting and when adjusted to severity, these factors have little influence on AKI rate. Additional studies, assessing levels of proteinuria and hematuria [22, 37] , pathological findings and translational research are needed to further explore different mechanisms that may participate to AKI during severe SARS-CoV-2 infection. In conclusion, we did not find any association between complement activation or inflammatory markers and AKI. Our study suggests a tremendously high incidence of AKI in our cohort of critically ill COVID-19 patients, along with an independent association between AKI and outcome. Because of its marked influence on outcome, AKI should be identified promptly during SARS-CoV-2 infection.",
