Objective This study's main objective was to evaluate the impact of vaccine price levels, including payments, and the efficacy levels on COVID-19 vaccine demand. Methods Data for this study were collected from an online survey of 2000 US individuals aged 18 years and older, which included a set of contingent valuation questions. Parametric and nonparametric procedures were used to estimate the distribution of willingness-to-pay and willingness-to-accept values for the vaccine and to assess its association with vaccine efficacy levels (50, 70, and 95%). Results Most of the individuals (60%) indicated they were willing to pay a positive amount for the vaccine; 13.7% said they would only accept the vaccine if it were free; 14.1% were willing to take the vaccine only if they were paid; and 12.2% were not willing to accept the vaccine. The vaccine efficacy level was found to affect an individual's demand for the vaccine.",

Some economists have suggested paying people to get the COVID-19 vaccine to overcome vaccine skepticism and increase its acceptance [2] [3] [4] [5] . It is also reported that some employers plan to provide (or are already providing) financial incentives to their employees to increase vaccination rates, including 401(k) deposits (i.e., deposits on employer-sponsored pension accounts), cash, and gift cards [6] . Paying individuals to get vaccinated can be justified, as vaccination against COVID-19 benefits the individual receiving the vaccine and their community, as broad vaccination decreases the number of hosts for the virus. Still, little is known about the potential effect of financial incentives to increase COVID-19 vaccination rates. Therefore, this study's main objective was to evaluate the impact of vaccine price levels, including payment, on the demand for COVID-19 vaccines. A secondary objective was to assess the effect of vaccine efficacy level information on demand and acceptability.",

            "text": "The economic concept of willingness to pay (WTP) has been used widely to assess individuals' vaccine acceptability and demand [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] . Willingness to pay provides a measure of the maximum amount of money an individual is willing to give for acquiring a product or service. Getting vaccinated includes both expected benefits as well as expected costs. Expected benefits include avoiding direct (e.g., medical costs) and indirect expenses (e.g., lost income due to the disease) related to an illness. Expected costs include those associated with acquiring the vaccine (price paid, time spent waiting in line) and costs associated with vaccine potential side effects. Individuals' WTP value for a vaccine can then be interpreted as an individual valuation of the expected net benefits (benefits-costs) provided by a vaccine which, in most cases, are assumed to be positive. However, it is also possible that some individuals' valuation of a vaccine is negative if, for example, they believe a vaccine is unnecessary, has a high price tag, or can result in costly and adverse side effects. Individuals would then need to be compensated for accepting a vaccine. Willingness-to-accept (WTA) values measure the minimum compensation an individual will require to get vaccinated.",

The sample also had a larger proportion of male, Hispanic, and higher income individuals; and a lower proportion of Black respondents than the US population. However, the sample's proportions of low-income and rural respondents were similar to those in the population ( Table 1) . Most of the individuals (60%: 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.58-0.62) indicated they were willing to pay a positive amount for the COVID-19 vaccine; 13.7% (95% CI 0.12-0.15) said they would only accept the vaccine if given for free; 14.1% (95% CI 0.13-0.16) were willing to take the vaccine only if paid to do so; and 12.2% (95% CI 0.11-0.14) were not willing to accept the vaccine. Thus, an overall 87.8% of the sample indicated they were willing to get vaccinated.

The test failed to reject the null hypothesis of no association between vaccine efficacy level and the proportion willing to accept the vaccine if paid (p = 0.38). The proportion of individuals not willing to accept the vaccine decreased as the efficacy level increased, going from 14.5% for the vaccine with a 50% efficacy level to 11.7 and 10.3% for vaccines with 70 and 95% efficacy levels, respectively. In contrast, the proportion of individuals willing to pay for the vaccine increased with the efficacy levels. At the 50% efficacy level, the proportion of individuals willing to pay for the vaccine was 53.5%.

The median WTP values (left side of Table 3 ) were estimated in the US$250-US$350 range for the 50% efficacy vaccine and US$350-US$400 for vaccines with 70 and 95% levels of efficacy. Table 5 shows the estimated values for the parametric model for Pr(W \u2264 w). The null hypothesis that the efficacy level does not affect the values of the 1 and 2 coefficients was rejected in favor of the alternative hypothesis that the coefficients are affected by the efficacy level (\u03c7 2 (4) = 16.93; p = 0.002). In contrast, the null hypothesis that the efficacy level affects the means of the F + (W) and F + (W) distribution functions was not rejected (\u03c7 2 (4)=2.59; p = 0.629). Both conditional WTP and WTA distributions were asymmetric and had long tails, as the absolute mean values were larger than the absolute values of the medians. Among the group willing to get vaccinated if paid, the mean WTA value was US$716.17, whereas the median was US$525. The mean WTP among those willing to pay for the vaccine was US$1147.06 with a median value of US$813.71. The overall mean WTP across all individuals willing to get vaccinated was US$705.81. Knowledge about individuals' acceptance and demand for a vaccine against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 is essential for designing and implementing vaccination campaigns. Whereas several studies have evaluated the acceptability of a COVID-19 vaccine in the USA [37, 38] , this study evaluates the demand using the economic concepts of WTP and WTA.",

This percentage includes about 13-15% willing to get vaccinated if paid a positive amount. Therefore, it is estimated that about 68-75% of individuals would get vaccinated if the vaccine were free, which is the current situation in the country (68, 72, and 75% for 50, 70, and 95% vaccine efficacy levels, respectively). These estimates are in line with the estimated value obtained by the Kaiser Family Foundation (KFF) Health Tracking Poll conducted between 30 November and 8 December, 2020, which uses a different approach to measure vaccine acceptability [37] . The KFF asked individuals about the likelihood of getting vaccinated \"if a coronavirus vaccine was determined to be safe by scientists and was available for free to everyone who wanted it.\" In the KFF survey, 71% (11) of individuals indicated they would get the vaccine (41% \"would definitely\" get the vaccine, and 30% \"would probably\" get it). The KFF survey also included the \"probably not get it\" (12%) and \"definitely not get it\" (15%) options for respondents. These values are similar to the proportion willing to take the vaccine if paid (14%) and to the proportion of individuals not willing to get the vaccine even if paid (about 13%). It is important to note that KFF sample seems to be closer to the US population across several characteristics, including the proportion of male individuals (49%), employed (56%), and Hispanic respondents (16%); and thus differs from our sample, which had a higher proportion of individuals in these groups. However, the KFF sample did not perfectly match all the characteristics of the US population as it included, for example, larger proportions of individuals with high school education and some college: 38, 30% respectively, compared to 27 and 20% in the population; and consequently, a lower proportion of individuals with at least a bachelor's degree (31% compared to 42% in the US population) ( Table 1) .",

A review paper assessing the impact of survey design on COVID-19 vaccination intention responses found that studies framing the intention question in more positive terms tend to result in higher positive responses [39] . The COVID-19 vaccine described to respondents in this study (see Appendix 1) indicated the vaccine was \"FDA authorized\" and \"for use in the US,\" and thus similar to the statement included in the KFF question that a \"vaccine was determined to be safe by scientists\". Hence, this study's approach to measuring vaccine acceptability (based on a contingent valuation approach with \"Yes\" or \"No\" types of questions) seems to yield comparable overall estimates of vaccine acceptability when compared to some surveys conducted at about the same period using questions about the likelihood of getting vaccinated and framed similarly in terms of stating quality assurances and price levels.",

According to our estimated demand model, a payment of about US$100, the amount being offered by some companies, would only increase vaccine demand by about 2% of the population (see Fig. 2 ) [6] . With a payment of about US$500, an additional 6.0-7.5% of the population would accept getting vaccinated. From a different perspective, payments of US$500 are needed to encourage vaccination in approximately 48% of individuals willing to get vaccinated if paid. This proportion increases to about 74% with payments of about US$1000. Therefore, payments between US$500 and US$1000 would allow reaching vaccination rates of 78-82% and 82-86% of the population, respectively, where the upper limits of the range correspond to the vaccine with a 95% efficacy level and the lower to a vaccine with a 50% efficacy level.",

The counterargument is that because disadvantaged individuals have been more affected by the pandemic, it is beneficial to use mechanisms that increase vaccination rates among these groups. Financial incentives can also help increase access to vaccines as getting vaccinated may include additional costs (e.g., transportation, the opportunity cost of wages), which can be covered with the payments. It is important to mention the ongoing debate regarding ethical and behavioral aspects of providing financial incentives for vaccines [2, 40] . For instance, some scientists have argued that financial incentives may discourage some individuals from getting vaccinated as payments can be perceived as an indication that the vaccine is risky [2] .",

In the USA, the government provided three rounds of cash payments of up to $1400 to adult taxpayers during the pandemic. These payments could have been made conditional (or could be made) on getting vaccinated. The impact and reach of government payment programs would also be more significant than individual employer efforts. However, mechanisms to provide financial help to those in need but who refused to get vaccinated would need to be considered. From a different perspective, vaccination payment programs implemented by employers may be perceived with less suspicion by those individuals that mistrust the government [41] . In terms of the timing of the payments, if payments are not offered to those already vaccinated, this could create perceptions of unfairness and increase delays in accepting new vaccines in the future. The estimated mean and median WTP values for the vaccine provide insights into the private economic benefits of COVID-19 vaccines. The results reflect large mean WTP values (among individuals willing to get vaccinated): US$594, US$706, and US$723 for vaccines with efficacy levels of 50, 70, and 95%, respectively. Even though the US population willing to get vaccinated includes a significant proportion of individuals willing to do so only if the vaccine is free or compensated for (25-30%), there is also a high proportion (20-27%) willing to pay US$1100 or more for the vaccine, which increases the average WTP value ( [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] 42] . The potential source of differences includes the country's economic conditions, with people in higher income countries having higher average WTP values for the vaccine. Dissimilarities in mean WTP values may also reflect differences in the methods used and the status of COVID-19 in each country at the time data were collected.",

Several previous studies have found that COVID-19 vaccine attributes affect the demand for the vaccine [26, [42] [43] [44] [45] [46] [47] . A substantial and significant effect of vaccine efficacy was found in Australia, where consumers were found to be willing to pay US$23.92 for a 1% increase in vaccine efficacy; this implies a US$360 increase in WTP when comparing, for example, COVID-19 vaccines with 84% and 99% efficacy levels (minimum and maximum levels used in that study). Moreover, some literature indicates that vaccine uptake can be increased if people are provided the freedom to choose the vaccine they believe is best (e.g., vaccines with higher efficacy levels) [48] .",

The reported efficacy levels of the first two vaccines approved in the USA (Pfizer and Moderna) were about 95%, which may have changed individuals' expectations about what a \"good\" vaccine is expected to be [16, 17, 49] . Communication about vaccine quality should encompass the ability of a vaccine to prevent a disease and the reduction of other negative health outcomes (e.g., hospitalization and death) associated with the disease if infected. Consistent with previous studies, vaccine demand and acceptability were found to differ across subgroups of the population. Whereas Black individuals only account for about 4.6% of the total sample, their proportions in the groups who were not willing to get the vaccine or accept it only if paid were significantly larger (8.7 and 7.1%, respectively). Higher levels of vaccine hesitancy among Black individuals are well documented in the literature and explained by various factors, including lower access to and mistrust of healthcare services and medicine and lower levels of awareness and education [50, 51] . In line with prior studies, vaccine acceptability was lower among individuals located in rural areas and individuals with lower levels of education, which have also been attributed to more insufficient access to and trust in healthcare services and medicine [39, 50] . A common factor used to explain low vaccine acceptability levels among Black, rural, and low education groups is the concern about vaccine costs. As this study considers vaccine price (including financial incentives), our findings suggest no price-related issues are more important for a significant proportion of the population.",

Lower vaccine acceptance among women relative to men has been constantly found in multiple previous studies [39, 51] .

Third, individuals' perceptions about products, including vaccines, change through time as more information becomes available (e.g., vaccine safety information) and/or there are changes in the context (e.g., rates of infection in the population); thus, WTP and WTA values are also likely to change. Fourth, there is some research indicating that people have difficulty understanding the concept of vaccine efficacy, which might have affected the results [52] . Finally, we only consider payments as a financial incentive and vaccine efficacy as a quality attribute. Future work should consider using other vaccine quality dimensions beyond its ability to prevent the disease (e.g., length of protection, safety) and other financial incentives such as lotteries. Future research should also consider evaluating the effect of sociodemographic characteristics, risk perceptions, and other vaccine characteristics on WTP and WTA values.",
