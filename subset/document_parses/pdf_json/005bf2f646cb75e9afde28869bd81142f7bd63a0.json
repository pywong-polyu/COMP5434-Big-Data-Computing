In addition, innumerable older persons defy the image of being frail and helpless, with countless older adults making valuable contributions to society (Corporation for National and Community Service, 2016; Diehl, Smyer, & Mehrotra, in press ).",

Indeed, extensive experimental, longitudinal, and cross-cultural research has shown that negative age beliefs adversely affect a wide-array of health outcomes (e.g., Chasteen, Pichora-Fuller, Dupuis, Smith, & Singh, 2015; Levy, Slade, Kunkel & Kasl, 2002; Levy et al., 2016; Siebert, Braun, & Wahl, in press) as well as emotional responses to stress A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t (Bellingtier & Neupert, 2018) of older persons. In addition, ageism, which includes negative age stereotypes, can have detrimental effects at the societal level. For example, in terms of the health care costs, ageism can have substantial economic costs for countries, which could compound the economic strains of the pandemic (Levy, Slade, Chang, Kannoth, & Wang, 2020) .",

The distinction between young and old, as well as language about \"walling off the old\" that is stressed in current public discourse reinforce our already age-divided societies (Hagestad & Uhlenberg, 2005) . As older adults are portrayed as susceptible to the negative effects of the COVID-19 outbreak, younger people tend to view themselves as immune to the virus and, thus, engage in risk behaviors with consequences that ultimately will need to be addressed by an already stressed health care system. The growing division between young and old also allows younger people to direct their anger and resentment about the situation towards older adults, who are clearly portrayed as the out group. In the future, this age division and negative portrayal of older adults and aging may affect younger people's aging process as they too internalize negative messages about old age and aging in the context of the current pandemic (Levy, 2009) . As behavioral scientists, it is our responsibility to stay alert to these dynamics and to educate the public about their dangers. Rather than pitting generations against each other, we should facilitate intergenerational exchange and solidarity.",

These ways include, but are not limited to, the use of online services like Zoom or FaceTime, phone calls, letters and engaging in common activities such as reading the same book or watching the same show and then discussing it. Physical distancing does not need to bring about emotional distancing. As soon as intergenerational contact A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t becomes individualized (e.g., within families, personal contacts to older neighbors) rather than taking place in public discourse, negative effects of social categorization, stigmatization, prejudice, and stereotyping are strongly reduced and replaced by norms of solidarity and relatedness (e.g., Bengtson & Putney, 2006) .

There is no doubt that this pandemic will strain and even overburden the health systems in many countries. Situations have already arisen where resources were not sufficient for all individuals in need. Hence, difficult decisions have had to be made: Who should be treated first (or at all)? Ethics-based rules for triage situations have to be developed in order to avoid ad hoc decisions of the health professionals on the frontline who are under enormous pressure to help everybody in need. Making triage decisions means, in the extreme, to help one person live and let another person die. We fear chronological age will become an accepted criterion in the very near future for such decisions-which would be the most blatant expression of ageism.",

In fact, recent research suggests that younger adults are at greater risk of psychological distress and loneliness during COVID-19 lockdowns than older adults. Further, those with more negative aging attitudes were also more likely to report higher distress and loneliness during the lockdown (Losada-Baltar et al., in press).",

We know that it is not only chronological age, but also the presence of chronic illness and co-morbidities that make individuals more vulnerable to COVID-19. We also know that during emergency situations, older adults with cognitive or physical impairments face even greater risks for having their autonomy compromised and their human rights violated (United Nations Human Rights -Office of the High Commissioner, 2020). We urge specific attention and protection for those who are most likely to be classified as vulnerable or at-risk.",

Given the promotion of physical distancing practices and the increasing reliance on digital technology to manage daily functioning, limited access to technology or limited ability to use technology might become major risk factors for depression and loneliness. These factors may be especially risky for some older adults by preventing them from accessing goods and services and obtaining the social support they may need during the outbreak. Thus, taking into account the \"digital divide\" that may exist for disadvantaged older adults also deserves attention.",

An important means to avoid confrontational discourse is to refrain from broad age-based categorizations, resulting in sweeping generalizations and a lack of differentiation. Ageism and categorization can be overcome by stressing that we're all in this together rather than emphasizing age as the critical variable, by individualizing communication and interaction, by drawing on personalized rather than generalized messages, and by invoking references to individual people. There is enough research evidence to guide current efforts to identify at-risk individuals in a more refined and effective way, aside from looking only at chronological age.",
