It is important not to place a label on any part of the inhaler. The pharmacy member will place the sealed baggie containing the inhaler along with one spacer in a plastic bag to be sent to the nursing unit. The outermost plastic bag will be labelled with a sticker to help remind staff of key steps. 2. The inhaler (drug canister + plastic actuator + cap) and the spacer will be kept in the plastic bag in the patient's room at all times. Upon transfer, all parts of the inhaler and spacer will be transferred with the patient for continued storage and use for the patient. 3. Upon discontinuation of the Patient or Medication, Registered Nurse (RN) or Respiratory Therapist (RT) will ensure all pieces, including drug canister + plastic actuator + cap + spacer, are contained in the patient-specific dispensing bag sent from the pharmacy. RN or RT member will discard the patient label (on the plastic baggie) in the Shred-It bin. 4. (RN) or (RT) will treat all contents as biohazardous and place the bag in the designated bin on each unit. 5. PPE team members will collect MDIs from the bin and deliver to sterile processing for reprocess cleaning and disinfection. PPE team members will wipe the bin following the removal of items each day. 6. The sterile processing department (SPD) personnel will don gloves as the appropriate PPE for disinfecting the inhalers. 7. The spacer will be discarded as a biohazard. 8.

While a debatable practice, several hospitals have successfully implemented related programs .the current MDI canister protocol states that compliance with disinfecting the MDI nozzle is vital [5, 6] . In one case, cultures were taken of the MDI nozzle before and after disinfection with an alcohol prep pad, as well as after treatments were administered. Growth of Staphylococcus epidermidis occurred in at least 5% of the cultures with all three types of specimens, including those taken after the nozzle was disinfected with an alcohol prep pad. In another case, the hospital assessed the failure to wipe the canister nozzle with an alcohol prep pad before patient use; 1 of 18 (5.5%) cultures resulted in the growth of Streptococci Group D (Enterococci) [7] . A discussion may need to take place in each institution that includes Doctors, infection control, and pharmacy to agree on the best way to implement and ensure safety.",

However, nebulization generates aerosol, which increases the risk of droplet contamination as droplets can remain in the air and can spread virus particles. Critical inhaler medication shortage looms as coronavirus cases soar. The use of metered-dose inhalers (MDI) reduces the risk of aerosol-generating particles. During the COVID pandemic, there has been a drastic increase in the use of MDI inhalers, which has led to a decrease in availability and a break in the supply chain. Hospital teams need to be proactive and start collecting the used MDI when appropriate and sterilize it following the provided procedure and keep in separate stock in case it is required. To minimize the risk of contamination, a discussion may need to take place in each institution that includes Doctors, infection control, SPD team and pharmacy to agree on the best way to implement and ensure safety (Fig. 1) ( Table 1) .",
