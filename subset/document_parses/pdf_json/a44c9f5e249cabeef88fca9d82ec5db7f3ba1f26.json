In the past 20 years, heat-related mortality among people aged over 65 has increased by more than 50%. 4 Higher temperatures have brought increased dehydration and renal function loss, dermatological malignancies, tropical infections, adverse mental health outcomes, pregnancy complications, allergies, and cardiovascular and pulmonary morbidity and mortality. 5 6 Harms disproportionately affect the most vulnerable, including children, older populations, ethnic minorities, poorer communities and those with underlying health problems. 2 4 Global heating is also contributing to the decline in global yield potential for major crops, falling by 1.8%-5.6% since 1981; this, together with the effects of extreme weather and soil depletion, is hampering efforts to reduce undernutrition. 4 Thriving ecosystems are essential to human health, and the widespread destruction of nature, including habitats and species, is eroding water and food security and increasing the chance of pandemics. 3 7 8 The consequences of the environmental crisis fall disproportionately on those countries and communities that have contributed least to the problem and are least able to mitigate the harms. Yet no country, no matter how wealthy, can shield itself from these impacts. Allowing the consequences to fall disproportionately on the most vulnerable will breed more conflict, food insecurity, forced displacement and zoonotic disease, with severe implications for all countries and communities.

The cost of renewable energy is dropping rapidly. Many countries are aiming to protect at least 30% of the world's land and oceans by 2030. 11 These promises are not enough. Targets are easy to set and hard to achieve. They are yet to be matched with credible short-term and longerterm plans to accelerate cleaner technologies and transform societies. Emissions reduction plans do not adequately incorporate health considerations. 12 Concern is growing that temperature rises above 1.5\u00b0C are beginning to be seen as inevitable, or even acceptable, to powerful members of the global community. 13 Relatedly, current strategies for reducing emissions to net zero by the middle of the century implausibly assume that the world will acquire great capabilities to remove greenhouse gases from the atmosphere. 14 15 This insufficient action means that temperature increases are likely to be well in excess of 2\u00b0C, 16 a catastrophic outcome for health and environmental stability. Critically, the destruction of nature does not have parity of esteem with the climate element of the crisis, and every single global target to restore biodiversity loss by 2020 was missed. 17 This is an overall environmental crisis. 18 Health professionals are united with environmental scientists, businesses and many others in rejecting that this outcome is inevitable. More can and must be done now-in Glasgow and Kunming-and in the immediate years that follow. We join health professionals worldwide who have already supported calls for rapid action. 1 19 Equity must be at the centre of the global response. Contributing a fair share to the global effort means that reduction commitments must account for the cumulative, historical contribution each country has made to emissions, as well as its current emissions and capacity to respond. Wealthier countries will have to cut emissions more quickly, making reductions by 2030 beyond those currently proposed 20 21 and reaching net-zero emissions before 2050. Similar targets and emergency action are needed for biodiversity loss and the wider destruction of the natural world.",
