Urgent procedures were defined as those that occurred between 8 and 21 days of surgical case order placement. We used the volume, type, and urgency of ophthalmologic surgical procedures for the corresponding time periods in 2018 and 2019 as a benchmark to which we compared the volume and type of surgeries in the 8-week study period in 2020.

As the total number of surgeries decreased after March 16, emergent cases accounted for a greater portion of all surgeries compared to before (52.94% vs. 26.44% before). In contrast, the absolute number of urgent cases decreased greatly from 26 prior to March 16 to four, which is outside the 2018-2019 range of 12 to 24 urgent cases. The decrease in urgent cases is likely to be due to recommendations to delay non-emergent cases while protocols were being created to keep patients and surgical staff safe. Alternatively, fewer patients were being evaluated in clinic after March 16, resulting in fewer diagnoses that might lead to scheduling surgery within 21 days [7] . Patients may have also foregone visits for conditions that have been lingering due to the shelter-in-place recommendations or limiting outdoor activities. The number of emergent cases did not see the same decrease. Interestingly, the number of retinal detachment surgeries was higher (49) right before the shelter-in-place than in years prior (27 and 28), which could either be from increased referrals due to evolving operating room recommendations which may not have been easily implemented in community practices or due to a variation in the incidence of retinal detachments this year. If the latter is the case, the sudden decline during the shelter-inplace either implies that patients were not seeking care for detachments, or that limitations in activity decreased the incidence of detachments. Similar data has been published in preterm births and in care of myocardial infarctions [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] . This needs to be evaluated further.",

For example, after April 3, there were six cases for retinal detachments, all of which were emergent. The above demonstrates the need for specialists to continue to provide specialty care not otherwise available to patients. Due to the nature of the ophthalmology examination, patients presenting with vague symptoms (blurry vision or new floaters) need to be evaluated to determine whether their case is emergent. A number of these patients will not have emergencies, but all need to be evaluated safely to determine the urgency of their underlying condition.",

Fewer older patients had surgical procedures during the 4-week COVID period while younger (pediatric) patients continued to have surgery and therefore made up more of the surgical population. Our practice and the associated children's hospital, which was unaffected by the initial surge, sees a large number of pediatric retina patients and younger patients continued to have examinations under anesthesia and retinal detachment repairs. Younger patients seeking retina care are likely to be more emergent due to the risk of permanent vision loss from retinal detachments or the diagnosis of an intraocular tumor. Older patients may have disproportionately rescheduled or cancelled their surgeries not only because they were \"elective\" but also because they wanted to avoid visiting the hospital, since older age is a risk factor for serious complications related to COVID-19 [13] . With delays in these surgical procedures, the visual health of the older population may be impacted more heavily by the pandemic.",

In order to mitigate the effect of this potential bias, we included all patients who visited the vitreoretinal division of our academic medical center during the time periods of interest in 2018, 2019, and 2020. Second, we analyzed all patient encounters coded by physicians in the division. However, trauma surgeries completed by non-retina surgeons were not included in this study. Third, we used March 16 as the date delineating \"before\" and \"during COVID-19\" based on the healthcare institution's recommendations, though an official stay-at-home order was not issued in Atlanta, GA until March 27 and the Georgia statewide shelter-in-place was not issued until April 3, 2020 [14, 15] . We tried to address the potential effects of this discrepancy in time points by comparing the 2020 \"during COVID-19\" time period to the corresponding time periods in 2019 and 2018. Additionally, we calculated the urgency of surgical cases based on the dates of surgical case order placement and the completion of surgeries. Given this data collection, we were unable to determine post-schedule alterations or the postponement of surgeries. Finally, since our academic medical center sees a large volume of pediatric patients, which may differ from other institutions, the average age of our patients decreased.",

We found that older patients were affected by the rescheduling and cancellations of surgical procedures due to COVID-19, whereas pediatric patients continued to need and present for emergent surgeries. Retinal detachments continued at a similar rate, while care for urgent cases declined. These results may reveal an unmet need for older patients and those with urgent cases when national guidelines in response to a global pandemic such as COVID-19 are implemented. Future recommendations for ophthalmologists should consider these patients likely to experience reduced access to ophthalmologic care during a pandemic. The long-term effects of the national recommendations in response to COVID-19 on the visual health of the population requires further investigation.",
