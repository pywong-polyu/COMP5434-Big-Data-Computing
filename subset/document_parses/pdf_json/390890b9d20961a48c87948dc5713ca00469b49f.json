Method: We went through recommended phases and their corresponding steps to create a valid and reliable scale: (a) item development (including 1. domain identification and item generation, 2. content validity), (b) scale development (including 1. pretesting questions, 2. sampling and survey administration, 3. item reduction, and 4. extraction of factors), and (c) scale evaluation (including 1. tests of dimensionality, 2. tests of reliability, and 3. tests of validity). Results: We found four factors with eigenvalues greater than 1 that were accounted for 0.63 of the total variance. The 4factor solution showed all items had factor loading greater than 0.4 and each belonged to one factor. The fit indices indicated the 4-factor solution model was fitted to our data. Conclusion: In sum, the Pandemic Risk and Reaction Scale (PRRS) is a valid and reliable self-reported scale to assess the level of perceived risk and safety behaviors during pandemics.",

Based on the current evidences from past pandemics, the level of both avoidant and preventive behaviors is related to some personal factors. Being female, older age, having small children at home, and higher educational degrees increase the level of safety behaviors (4) (5) (6) . Risk perception is an important concept which assumed to be the core predictor of safety behaviors in different health theories. \"Risk perception\" or \"perceived risk\" refers to one's judgment in regards to the consequences of a harmful event like pandemics (5, 7).",

For example, in a telephone-based survey during the second wave of N1H1 influenza in the United States, it was revealed that public risk perception was significantly associated with preparatory behaviors (10) . On the other side, some experimental studies have shown that health related safety behaviors are positive predictors of high level of health anxiety (11) . Also, it is found that excessive level of perceived risk elaborates unnecessary safety behaviors that have significant negative consequences on personal life (12) . Iran J Psychiatry 2020; 15: 4: 274-285 Original Article Risk perception and safety behaviors are correlated variables and their optimum level is crucial in management of any pandemic. Some researchers have developed self-report scales to assess responses to previous (eg, N1H1) and new (ie, corona virus) pandemics and published their psychometric findings (13) (14) (15) . For example, the Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S), a unidimensional 7-item scale, is developed to assess fear responses to the corona virus pandemic and is validated in different cultures (16) . Although some of the published scales have had good psychometric properties, most of them have focused on psychological reactions, including fear, stress and anxiety related to the pandemic, and actual behavioral responses are left behind. Given that the risk perception and safety behaviors are important variables in pandemic studies, we have developed a brief self-reported questionnaire to assess these concepts simultaneously among general population. In this paper we have presented the procedure of scale development including item generation, explanatory and confirmatory factor analysis. We named this questionnaire the Pandemic Risk and Reaction Scale (PRRS).",

At first, we comprehensively reviewed current theories of risk communication, risk perception, and safety behaviors, and existing evidences from previous pandemics. We carefully discussed obtained data and finally concluded 2 main categories for risk perception (ie, societal risk and personal risk) and 2 main categories for safety behaviors (ie, avoidant behaviors and preventive behaviors). The \"societal risk\" refers to one's perception of how an event can be hazardous for entire society and \"personal risk\" refers to perceived hazard about oneself. \"Avoidant behavior\" refers to a group of behaviors like staying at home and avoiding public transportation. \"Preventive behavior\" refers to a group of behaviors like washing hands and using sanitizers. Then, we generated items corresponding to above mentioned categories. Some items were modified versions of questions asked in previous surveys during the pandemics and some of them were new. Initially, we developed a set of 19 items and then reduced them to 15 items during our group discussions . To assess content validity, we sent the 15-item questionnaire to a group of 5 experts in the fields of psychiatry, psychology, and sociology and wanted them to rate the relevancy of each item on a Likert scale from 1 to 5 and then calculated Cohen's coefficient kappa (k). The k values showed the agreement between raters were in perfect range for all items (They were more than 0.90.). Then, we sent our questionnaire to a sample of respondents and asked them to rate each item on a Likert scale from 1 to 5, which reflected their understandability. Next, we checked pilot respondents' thoughts about each item using cognitive interview. All items were confirmed and we finalized a 15-item questionnaire.",

We developed a 15-item scale, the Pandemic Risk and Reaction Scale (PRRS), which has 4 items for \"societal risk\", 3 for \"personal risk\", 5 for \"avoidant behavior\" and 3 for \"preventive behavior\". We found a 4-factor solution using principal component analysis, which confirmed by confirmatory factor analysis. The scale also shows good reliability and validity. Previous studies have shown a positive relationship between perceived risk and problematic mental health symptoms during disasters. As an index of convergent validity, we found that the mean of PRRS subscales are positively related to the total scores of SHAI, K-10, IES, and GHQ. It is also revealed that the mean of PRRS subscales are significantly different between those who have high level of psychological symptoms and those with low level of psychological symptoms.

As we found in our study, there is a positive correlation between FCV-19S sore and the level of mental health problems in general population. Although the FCV-19S have shown good psychometric properties, it only focused on fear responses. The PRRS went further and assessed societal risk (4 items), personal risk (3 items), avoidant behavior (5 items), and preventive behavior (3 items) simultaneously. The PRRS allows assessing more areas, while it keeps briefness and does not have many more items. The COVID Stress Scales (CSS) is another self-reported questionnaire (28) . It has 35 items and assessed 5 different areas of COVID-related stress and anxiety symptoms: (1) Danger and contamination fears, (2) fears about economic consequences, (3) xenophobia, (4) compulsive checking and reassurance seeking, and (5) traumatic stress symptoms. A large population-based study has shown that CSS has good psychometric properties and its scores are positively correlated with problematic psychological symptoms like obsessivecompulsive disorder (OCD), anxiety, depression, xenophobia, and health anxiety. Although a good characteristic of CSS is that it covers important areas like \"fears about economic consequences\" and \"traumatic stress symptoms\", it focused on psychological reactions, not actual behaviors. Another issue about CSS is that it is relatively a long questionnaire and takes much time to fill out.",
