The standard treatment approach usually consists of a combination of neurosurgical aspiration of the abscess and prolonged high-dose antibiotic therapy to ensure eradication of bacteria within the abscess cavity. There are no randomized controlled trials on antibiotic treatment of brain abscess to evaluate the standard regimen in immunocompetent individuals of intravenous (IV) 3rd generation cephalosporin and metronidazole for 6-8 weeks [3, 12] . However, other regimens have been suggested in the literature as well, including additional 6-12 weeks of oral antibiotics following the intravenous treatment, or shorter intravenous antibiotic courses when surgical evacuation has been performed [2, 12, 13] . Intraventricular rupture of brain abscess (IVROBA), severe immunocompromise, and certain pathogens (e.g., mycobacteria, nocardia, and fungi) may on the other hand require extended treatment for several months up to years [12] .",

Some hospitals may offer outpatient parenteral antibiotics to selected patients, but logistic demands for this option are also high and education of patients and staff is needed to ensure adherence to therapy, appropriate monitoring of efficacy and safety, social support, and easy access to medical counsel.",

Although prone to selection and publication bias, this regimen has been reported to be safe and effective in a few retrospective observational studies with a total of 231 patients of which 18 (8%) died [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] . Moreover, two recent non-inferiority trials of early transition to oral treatment for endocarditis and bone and joint infections showed that an early switch to oral therapy in serious and invasive infections can be as effective as IV treatment, opening up the possibility this may also be feasible for brain abscess patients [20, 21] . A post hoc analysis of patients with endocarditis showed a decreased mortality in patients assigned to shortened IV therapy compared with standard therapy (16% vs. 27%, hazard rate ratio 0.57 [95% CI 0.37-0.87]) after a median of 3.5 years of observation [22] . In addition, oral treatment has been considered standard of care for other focal central nervous system (CNS) infections such as cerebral toxoplasmosis and CNS tuberculomas for decades. However, properly controlled trials are needed to examine this treatment strategy in bacterial brain abscess patients.",

The score reflects both measurable physical and cognitive deficit as well as more intangible impairment that nonetheless greatly impact the social functioning of patients [26] . In addition to validated standardized interviews developed for use in admitted patients or in outpatient settings, the score has also been shown to maintain very high reliability for use in telephone interviews (weighted K-statistic of 0.92 between in-person and telephone interview and 0.84 for inter-rater reliability) and as postal questionnaires [29] [30] [31] .

Compared with standard methods, large reductions in exposed patients is possible using this approach in case one treatment arm is unexpectedly inferior to the other, although there may be a slight loss of power compared with standard stopping criteria (< 1%) [43] .",

If interim analyses show non-inferiority of the experimental arm, the study should be allowed to continue due to the subjectivity of the non-inferiority margin and to ensure statistical certainty of the final results.
