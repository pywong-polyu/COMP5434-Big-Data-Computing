While reading this literature, we noticed statistical attributes that are sometimes related to questionable research practices, which can undermine the reported conclusions. To quantify these attributes, we applied the Test for Excess Success (TES) individually to 37 articles that investigate various properties of object-based attention and comprise four or more experiments. A TES analysis estimates the probability that a direct replication of the experiments in a given article with the same sample sizes would have the same success (or better) as the original article. If the probability is low, then readers should be skeptical about the conclusions that are based on those experimental results. We find that 19 of the 37 analyzed articles (51%) seem too good to be true in that they have a replication probability below 0.1. In a new large sample study, we do find evidence for the basic object-based attention effect in the two-rectangles paradigm, which this literature builds on. A power analysis using this data shows that commonly used sample sizes in studies that investigate properties of object-based attention with the tworectangles paradigm are, in fact, much too small to reliably detect even the basic effect.",

            "text": "It is well known that people can process visual information even without directly looking at a stimulus. In particular, we seem to be able to focus processing resources to a certain spatial area, with stimuli outside of this focus taking longer to detect and identify (e.g., Posner, 1980) . Such spatial attention effects are well established, and various paradigms have investigated their temporal and spatial properties and limitations. For example, in a spatial cuing task (Fig. 1) , a central arrow points to the left or right and indicates with 80% accu-racy where a target letter will appear. Observers tend to be about 40 ms faster at identifying a letter appearing at the cued location compared to the uncued location. A neutral condition (with no arrow cue) typically produces a response time between those for the cued and uncued conditions. These results suggest that attentional resources are guided to aid processing at the cued location, and that it takes time to redirect attention from the cued side of the visual field to the uncued side. Other studies have shown that this effect depends on the distance between the target and the cued location (e.g., Mangun & Hillyard, 1988) .",

            "text": "Visual perception is often concerned with objects rather than with a certain spatial location, and many researchers therefore suspected that attentional processing could have an object-based component. Egly et al. (1994) reported empirical evidence for such object-based attention in a two-rectangles paradigm, schematized in Fig. 2 , which has since become the most commonly used paradigm in object-based attention research (Chen, 2012) . In this paradigm, two horizontally or vertically aligned rectangles serve as objects. The rectangles are first presented in isolation during a \"pre-cue\" period. One end of a rectangle is then cued, often by a luminance increment of contour parts. Consistent with spatial cuing effects, response times (e.g., for identifying a subsequent letter as \"T\" or \"L\") are fastest for valid trials, i.e., when the letter appears at the cued location. The invalid trials, i.e., when the letter appears at an uncued location, are divided into two categories of interest: invalid-same and invalid-different. During an invalid-same trial, the target letter appears at the uncued end of the same rectangle as the cue. During an invalid-different trial, the target letter appears at the close end of the rectangle that did not contain the cue. Notably, spatial attention effects should be similar for the invalid-different and the invalidsame trials, because the distance between the target and the cue is the same in both cases. Despite this similarity, Egly et al. (1994) found that response times were faster for the invalid-same as compared to the invalid-different trials. This preferential processing of a target in the cued rectangle is referred to as object-based attention. There are many variations of this paradigm where the objects, the cue, the timing between the cue and the target, the task, and the measurement of performance are modified.",

            "text": "Our interest in object-based attention was piqued because one of the authors (GF) suspected that a neural network model of visual processing (Francis et al., 2017) could explain some object-based attention effects revealed through the tworectangles paradigm. However, a literature review raised several concerns about published findings and conclusions. First, the reported object-based attention effect, as measured with the two-rectangles paradigm, is quite small (around 15 ms) compared to other effects based on reaction times (e.g., the spatial cuing effect is around 40 ms and the Stroop effect is around 70 ms). A small mean difference typically requires a large sample in order to produce statistical significance, but object-based attention studies often use quite small sample sizes (10-20 observers is common). These studies should therefore have low power and there should accordingly be many non-significant results in articles that comprise multiple studies, even if the effect exists. Contrary to these expectations, virtually none of the multi-study object-based attention articles in this literature reported experimental failures (sometimes non-significant outcomes were reported, but they were used to support theoretical conclusions and thus not treated as failures). Second, although the object-based attention effect has been replicated many times with small sample studies, a large sample (n = 120) study by Pilz et al. (2012) found a very small (non-significant) object-based attention effect of 6.5 ms. Roque and Boot (2015) reported similar results, albeit with fewer observers per condition.",

            "text": "A Test for Excess Success (TES) analysis (Francis, 2012 (Francis, , 2013a Ioannidis & Trikalinos, 2007) uses the reported data to estimate the success rate for a set of replication experiments. Using this test, we can detect if the sample sizes used for a set of studies are insufficient to reliably demonstrate the claimed effects. Random sampling ensures that experiments will sometimes fail to reject the null hypothesis, even when the alternative hypothesis is true. When experimental results are consistently successful even though the reported data suggest that some experiments should not be successful, the findings appear \"too good to be true.\" Scientists should be skeptical about the conclusions drawn from such data sets because it seems plausible that the experiments were not run properly, not analyzed properly, or not fully reported (e.g., Simmons et al., 2011) . With multiple studies, uniform success should be rare because basing conclusions on multiple tests engenders The key finding is that observers more quickly identify the target letter in the invalid-same than in the invalid-different trials low power. For example, the probability that a set of four independent experiments, each with a power of 0.8, all produce significant outcomes is only 0.8 4 = 0.41. Thus, some \"failures\" should be expected when conducting multiple studies. The TES analysis formalizes this fundamental property of hypothesis testing. Following convention (Begg & Mazumdar, 1994 ), we concluded excess success if the success rate for a set of studies was below 0.1. Given that desired power for a single experiment is usually at least 0.8, the 0.1 criterion is rather conservative: We suspect that most scientists would not be content with a success rate just above 0.1. Some people have questioned the validity and applicability of the TES analysis (e.g., Morey, 2013; Simonsohn, 2012) . These concerns have been addressed in Francis (2013a Francis ( , 2013b , and here we summarize this discussion. One raised concern is that the TES analysis does not take into account other non-reported TES analyses that might have been conducted on other articles, and so is itself subject to publication bias and therefore invalid. Such bias might exist, but it does not undermine the conclusions of a given TES analysis for the reported empirical studies in a multi-study publication. Such bias would be problematic if conclusions were inferred for empirical studies that were not part of the analysis. For this reason, we restrict the conclusion of a TES analysis to just the analyzed set of studies and their corresponding conclusions. We focus on findings reported within a single paper (rather than looking across papers) because then we can be confident that the original authors' conclusions are based on the set of experiments in the analyzed article.",

The conclusions of these papers depended on the empirical results of both the basic objectbased attention effect and the various modifications of the effect.

Abrams and Law (2000) reported that each of the studies produced results that supported their theoretical conclusion that object-based attention effects can be produced by purely endogenous cues, which suggests a common representation for exogenous and endogenous effects. If the theory is correct, and the population effects are as estimated by the samples, then the probability of getting eight independent studies like these to produce the desired results is the product of the success probabilities: P TES = .063. That is, even if the effects are real, the reported data suggest that the sample sizes and estimated effects are so small that there is only around a 6% chance of reproducing the observed uniform success across experiments and tests. The low probability of success begs the question of how the reported findings could have been generated. Over the past few years, scientists have realized that some standard approaches (now called Questionable Research Practices, QRPs) to data collection, analysis, and reporting can lead to overly successful experimental outcomes, even when there are actually no effects in the population (e.g., Francis, 2012; Simmons et al., 2011) . We cannot identify precisely what lies behind the results reported in Abrams and Law (2000) , but given the ease with which QRPs can happen even when authors do not intentionally set out to mislead readers (Gelman & Loken, 2014) , we advise scientists to be skeptical about the validity of the reported results in Abrams and Law (2000) and the conclusions drawn from those results.",

(1994) . Searching for this term seemed to return articles with that term and also articles that used the word \"rectangle.\" This search mostly reported articles that used a version of the two-rectangles method; however, some articles (roughly 22%) used other methods or stimuli to investigate object-based attention. We included the latter as long as they investigated properties of object-based attention. We restricted our analysis to articles with at least four experiments because the TES analysis becomes more sensitive to the impact of questionable research practices with more reported results (this criterion rules out some influential articles, including Egly et al. (1994) , which had only two experiments). Importantly, none of the articles measured only the basic object-based attention effect. Rather, they investigated properties or implications of object-based attention (e.g., trying to identify mechanisms underlying the effect or using various stimuli and tasks to mitigate/enhance the effect). Details of the identification and selection of articles can be found in the OSM. We identified 46 articles that matched our criteria, but were unable to analyze nine of them due to insufficient statistical information or because numerous errors in the reported statistics impeded analysis. Details of the unanalyzed publications can be found in the OSM. Although there are nonhuman animal studies of object-based attention, none of the articles we found with non-human subjects satisfied all of our selection criteria.",

While this finding is discouraging, the situation seems to be even worse in general topics in psychology. An investigation of articles with four or more experiments in the journal Psychological Science found that 36 of 44 articles (82%) had excess success (Francis, 2014) , and a similar investigation of psychologyrelated articles in the journal Science found that 15 out of 18 articles (83%) had excess success .

We feel there are two key lessons. First, despite strong previous empirical evidence that the objectbased attention effect is small, studies since 2012 have not incorporated that information into the design of their experiments. Instead, scientists continue to use small sample sizes to measure small effects, which is very inefficient and should produce many \"failures.\" Second, the specific conclusions in studies with excess success should be considered unfounded for articles that have excess success.

Studies in Table 4 Given the excess success of these papers, it is not surprising that they are unable to resolve the debate.

The mean value of 15 ms is commonly reported in experiments using the tworectangles paradigm. The standard deviation value of 100 ms and the correlation of 0.8 were based on standard deviations across participants for a variety of on-line experiments that measure reaction times (Francis & Neath, 2015) . These values are only meant to generate \"ballpark\" estimates of effects so that we can identify reasonable sample sizes. If these population attributes are correct, then an experiment with n =189 participants will have a power of 0.9 for a two-tailed dependent sample t-test (Francis, 2018) . Participants were recruited from students at Purdue University, who received course credit for participation. Data were collected during the beginnings of the COVID-19 pandemic, when the university switched to on-line classes. To support students who needed to earn course credit, we extended data collection beyond our initial goal and ended up with n = 264 participants.

We ran separate one-way ANOVAs for the different rectangle orientations with subsequent contrasts to compare the invalid-same and invalid-different conditions. Horizontal rectangles produced a strong object-based attention effect (32.6 ms; t(526) = 5.55, p < .001). Vertical rectangles, however, produced a non-significant reverse effect (-4.1 ms, t(526) = 0.75, p = 0.45). Thus, consistent with Pilz et al. (2012) , we find that measures of the object-based effect seem dependent on the orientation of the rectangles. Possibly, there are two effects at play in the two-rectangles paradigm: First, an objectbased effect that facilitates attention shifts within objects as opposed to across objects, and second, a vertical/horizontal asymmetry such that horizontal attention shifts are faster than vertical attention shifts. For example, according to Kr\u00f6se and Julesz (1989) , targets on the horizontal meridian are easier to detect than targets on the vertical meridian. This asymmetry may reflect hemifield specificity for some attention processes (Alvarez & Cavanagh, 2005; Chen et al., 2013; Holcombe & Chen, 2012) , so that attention can be more efficiently allocated in different hemifields (horizontal rectangles) than within a single hemifield (vertical rectangles). Indeed, Barnas and Greenberg (2016) found more efficient allocation of object- based attention along the horizontal meridian as compared to the vertical meridian. This vertical/horizontal asymmetry effect is typically averaged out in two-rectangle paradigms by using both vertical and horizontal rectangles such that equally many horizontal and vertical shifts constitute trials of the invalid-same and invalid-different conditions. Assuming linearity, the average difference between invalid-same and invalid-different response times over horizontal and vertical rectangles is the true object-based attention effect.",

Thus, the result of this QRP is a theoretical conclusion that dramatically inflates the object-based attention effect. This alternative analysis has only scratched the surface of what can be flexibly applied to the data set. We leave it to the reader to explore what other effects might be produced by other flexible trial exclusion criteria. It is easy to come up with a story to match the results of virtually any questionable analysis (e.g., there is an object-based attention effect for long ISIs but not short ISIs), even though that conclusion does not hold for the full data set.",

Rather, we suspect that scientists follow standard practice to justify different types of analyses.",

The absence of such failures is a marker that something has gone wrong in these articles with regard to data collection, analysis, or reporting.

            "text": "A fundamental problem for many of the studies of objectbased attention that we investigated (even those that do not exhibit excess success) is that they seem to be woefully underpowered. A power analysis using optimistic values for the difference of means, standard deviations, and correlation, indicates that an appropriately powered experiment (e.g., 0.8-0.9 power) requires nearly ten times as many participants as is commonly used in the literature. Moving forward, it might be more reasonable to use the findings from our on-line study to guide the design of future experiments. There, we find a difference of means around 14 ms, standard deviations of around 100 ms, and a correlation between invalid-same and invaliddifferent conditions of around 0.7. If those values are representative of the population, then a new experiment aiming for 90% power needs n = 324 observers for a two-tailed t-test (Francis, 2018) . This analysis is for an experiment aimed at showing just the simplest object-based attention effect. When multiple effects are studied (e.g., differences in object-based attention for exogenous and endogenous cues) even larger samples are needed. In some situations, sufficient power might be achievable with a smaller sample size, as long as the experimental methods increase the difference of means, decrease the standard deviations, or increase the correlation between conditions. Scientists hoping to use smaller sample sizes need to explain why their methods should promote such improvements compared to the data set reported here. 1 Some scientists may find it useful to preregister their experimental designs (e.g., Munaf\u00f2 et al., 2017) to motivate such considerations.",

Indeed, none of the studies listed in Table 4 reported a power analysis, even when they directly replicated previous findings. It is common among scientists to use sample sizes similar to previous studies, but if those previous studies generated p-values just a bit below the significance criterion, then predicted power for a replication study with the same sample size is barely over 50% (a replication of the experiment is just as likely to be above as below the criterion, assuming the original experiment captured the population effect size). If previous studies used questionable research practices that tend to overestimate effects, then the true power will be even lower.",

The critical shortcoming for many of these studies is that the sample sizes are so small that the investigations could (should) hardly ever have worked. We conclude that important scientific work can be done by simply adopting the experimental designs from these articles and replicating the experiments with much larger sample sizes.
