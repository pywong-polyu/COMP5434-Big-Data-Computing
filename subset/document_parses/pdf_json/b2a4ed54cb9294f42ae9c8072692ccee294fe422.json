Further, regular exercise can improve mental health, cognition and sleep quality, in both the general population and those with severe mental health conditions [13] [14] [15] [16] and may aid smoking cessation in the long term [17, 18] . Acute exercise bouts can also have immediate effects on appetite and cigarette cravings [19] [20] [21] , cognitive functioning [22] and positive wellbeing in healthy and clinical populations [22] [23] [24] . This said, people with SMI engage in significantly less moderate and vigorous-intensity exercise than the general population and are less likely to meet physical activity guidelines of 150 min of exercise per week [25] . Thus, low levels of physical activity are recognised as contributing towards physical, mental and cognitive ill health in this population group [13] , along with higher levels of tobacco consumption and antipsychotic-induced weight gain. Physical activity is a modifiable lifestyle risk factor; thus, a focus of current research is to increase levels of physical activity in people with SMI and to promote uptake of structured exercise interventions [26] . For example, the recent European Psychiatric Association (EPA) guidance draws on 20 past systematic reviews in the SMI population and suggests physical activity should be used as an adjunctive treatment in SMI to improve mental health symptoms, physical health, cognition and quality of life [13] .",

            "text": "High-intensity interval training (HIIT) is a type of exercise characterised by alternating short bursts (typically 30 s to 4 min) of high-intensity exercise interspersed by similar length periods of light exercise or rest, repeated for typically 10-25 min [27] . This popular fitness approach yields positive effects on physical and mental health in the general population and may be more beneficial in terms of improvements in cardiometabolic health when compared to traditional moderate-intensity continuous training (MICT) approaches [28] . Preliminary work has sought to establish the effectiveness of HIIT in people with schizophrenia spectrum disorders [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] , major depressive disorders [36] [37] [38] [39] and adults with self-reported psychiatric problems [40] in interventions of duration 12 days to 6 months. This work has been summarised in two recent meta-analyses, whereby significant improvements in depressive symptoms and cardiorespiratory fitness were reported post HIIT intervention, and there was a suggestion that HIIT may be more beneficial in terms of improvements in depressive symptoms when compared to MICT [41, 42] . Further, HIIT may improve cognitive measures including verbal learning and overall neurocognition [35] . This said, there is inconsistency concerning the effects of HIIT on psychopathology, social and global functioning and anthropometric measures, which is hampered by small sample sizes and a paucity of clinical trials. The total number of participants with an SMI allocated to HIIT ranges from 8 [40] to 43 [29, 35] across trials, and meta-analysis data summarised findings from just 366 participants with SMI, including comparison groups. To add, previous work in people with SMI has reported a low rate of adverse events (AE) including no acute injuries or cardiovascular events, completion rates of approximately 71% and a mean attendance at sessions of 74%, suggesting good feasibility and acceptability, although these measures have only been reported in roughly half of HIIT trials in people with SMI to date [41, 42] .",

For example, shift work for staff, access and space issues, and the profile of needs and acuity in the patient group. Inpatients are typically more acutely unwell and receive higher doses of psychotropic medication [45] and polypharmacy [46] . These factors are likely to impact service implementation and patient engagement with an exercise intervention, which in turn will impact their efficacy. To date, four papers have assessed the effect of HIIT in inpatients with MDD [36] [37] [38] [39] , only one has assessed HIIT in inpatients with schizophrenia [32] and another has looked at the acute effects of a single bout of HIIT in adolescents receiving inpatient mental health treatment [44] , highlighting a need for further research in this population and setting. Moreover, a recent qualitative analysis explored perspectives on implementing HIIT interventions in inpatient mental health settings [47] . Across seven focus groups, in inpatients with SMI, carer and staff groups, HIIT was seen positively, with beliefs that it would help inpatients feel more relaxed, build their fitness, and provide a break from the monotony of ward environments. This said, concerns were noted related to patient motivation, safety, especially for those with chronic physical health comorbidities, and practical logistical factors, including having access to the right sports clothing and staff availability to supervise [47] .",

The naturalistic study is currently being undertaken to address issues surrounding the small sample size following the early termination of the RCT. There are currently no plans to resume recruitment in the RCT capacity. Specifically, a naturalistic design is being undertaken, rather than continuing with the original RCT format, due to the suspected difficulties in recruiting enough participants to fulfil both HIIT and TAU arms in the RCT design during covid. New admissions to inpatient wards dropped during the first wave of the pandemic, with an additional 2441 patients discharged from the hospital setting to free up bed capacity for the emergency response and to reduce the risk of infection [50] . This means that there were fewer inpatients with SMI overall, with many of those remaining in inpatient settings experiencing a greater symptom load, a more negative impact on functioning with attendant reduced likelihood and capacity of consenting to research and completing research assessments. The adapted naturalistic design will allow for the collection of feasibility and acceptability data which are the primary outcomes of the pilot study. Moreover, those who are more severely ill are less likely to participate in RCTs of lifestyle interventions [51] ; thus, the use of a naturalistic design may provide a greater indication of uptake of HIIT in a clinical capacity.",

It is an extrapolation method whereby heart rate workload points are gathered and extrapolated to age-predicted maximal heart rate [54] . Mental health assessments, the cognitive test, anthropometric measures, lifestyle assessments and the bicycle YMCA submaximal fitness test were to be repeated at week 6 and week 12 (post-intervention). Participants who were not physically able to complete the YMCA test were excluded from the study due to low baseline fitness and suspected difficulties in exercising at high intensity, this decision was undertaken to minimise the potential occurrence of AEs. Following successful completion of these assessments, the participant was assigned a unique code that was sent to King's Clinical Trial Unit for randomisation. Participants were randomised in a 1:1 ratio to HIIT or TAU conditions using block randomisation with varying block sizes. Participants and researchers were notified of allocation after completion of all baseline assessments.",

The total session duration is 19 min. A 4-min time scale to warm-up and cool-down was deemed an appropriate length based on previous HIIT trials whereby similar length warm-up and cool-down periods have been found to be safe and feasible [28, 42] . The heart rate is recorded throughout each high-intensity interval using handlebar sensors or a chest strap to monitor compliance with target heart rates. The heart rate ranges are achieved by adjusting ergometer resistance and speed. Handlebars only provide an accurate recording of heart rate if held continuously throughout the duration of the high intensity interval; therefore, participants who did not want to continuously hold the handlebar sensors during vigorous exercise were offered the opportunity to wear a chest strap to monitor the heart rate during the RCT phase. The option to utilise a chest strap will not be offered in the naturalistic study phase due to COVID-19-imposed hygiene measures and impracticalities of providing a separate chest strap for each participant that can be washed after each use. External influences on the heart rate, such as co-prescribed beta-blocker medications, will be recorded and presented.",

Moreover, direct measurement requires participations to exercise until exhaustion, which may be challenging for those with lower baseline fitness and those with chronic psychiatric symptoms. The YMCA test has been validated for the prediction of VO2max [54] and has been used to predict VO2max in people with SMI [76, 77] .

To the best of our knowledge, no HIIT interventions have been developed and tested in the NHS. This study will allow us to understand the feasibility of deploying the HIIT intervention itself and the use of the primary, secondary and tertiary outcome measures. Upon completion of the study, we will have a detailed overview of whether the delivery and planned evaluation approach are feasible and acceptable to deliver as part of a multi-centre large-scale definitive trial; namely whether participants agree to take part, continue to attend HIIT sessions and assessments and adhere to the HIIT protocol. The design of the study, with both RCT and naturalistic study design elements, will allow us to determine feasibility and acceptability of HIIT research when delivered in both research and clinical/naturalistic settings. Both phases of the study will address the feasibility and acceptability of delivering HIIT, while the RCT element will offer an indication to whether mental and physical health measures can be obtained providing an indication as to whether a large scale RCT of HIIT is the best design to determine its clinical effectiveness. With this said, the design of the study has various limitations. Suspension of the RCT study phase due to COVID-19 will limit power to detect changes in secondary and tertiary outcomes, and these outcomes will not be measured during the naturalistic study phase. Moreover, recruitment is limited to one NHS trust (although participants will be recruited from three sites), and reliability of measures of adherence to target heart rate will be limited in the naturalistic study phase due to inability to use chest straps for monitoring heart rate.",

The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines recommend that interventions be offered to support people with SMI to be more active [84] . HIIT is a time-efficient intervention that has yielded benefits for physical and mental health in other settings and populations [28] . If HIIT is found to be feasible and acceptable in inpatients with SMI, there would be scope for large-scale work and the potential implementation of this intervention in inpatient mental health facilities.",
