In \"pre-pandemic era,\" these patients would be considered for hospital admission or frequent face-to-face assessments. Our intention was to implement a virtual admission for patients in need of intensive monitoring and prompt adjustment of treatment. Previous studies investigating telemedicine for PD patients were focused on single interactions comparable to outpatient clinic appointments [1] [2] [3] . To the best of our knowledge, there are no other studies employing telemedicine as a \"virtual admission.\"",

We also asked for on/off charts to be completed for 48 h, these were reviewed before the baseline assessment on day 1. Outcomes were Movement Disorder Society-Sponsored Revision of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS), patient reported satisfaction, and adverse events. At baseline (day 1), clinical history and medications were reviewed, and MDS-UPDRS was completed in both ON and OFF state (Table 1) . Treatment changes were instituted as necessary. On day 3, clinical progress, side effects, and complications were assessed, allowing for any necessary adjustments to be made. Day 5 assessment allowed for final review of progress and complications, with further assessment of MDS-UPDRS.",

            "text": "This project is driven by the need for a method with which to closely monitor and adjust treatment in such patients, during a time where the risks of face-to-face assessment are significant [4] . The additional benefits pertain to the well-known risks of hospital attendance in PD patients-falls, infection, change in mental status among others. Further advantages might be expected due to elimination of the physical and psychological impacts of hospital attendance, such as the discomfort of long journeys, stress, and financial expense [5] . We often factor in the effects of such stress on the severity of patients' symptoms at the time of clinical assessments; we hoped that assessment in the home environment may improve on this. There were some drawbacks of video assessments. The completeness and quality of examination relied heavily upon the technology available to the patient and the availability of caregiver support. Using video consultation, it was not possible to assess postural symptoms and determining the degree of rigidity was difficult. The ability to assess amplitude of tremor largely depended upon the device used by the patient, and the skill of the caregiver at positioning the camera. Therefore, full and accurate MDS-UPDRS score was not possible. In the current project, the referral for virtual admissions was prompted by the patient's own neurologist or by the PD specialist nurse. This was on the basis of any of severe motor fluctuations, prolonged off periods, or problematic dyskinesia. In all circumstances, the patients had disease duration more than 5 years and were established on oral medications, and in one patient apomorphine. Initial steps to optimize symptoms were not successful and the clinician concluded that a period of monitoring was necessary to guide further treatment decisions.",

In order to do this, the referral process must be further developed as it was proposed by Cilia et al. [6] In this study, PD nurses made all initial patient contact and used a coding system based on morbidity risks and change in level of dependence in order to guide urgency of assessment by the neurologist. This method of triage was effective at selecting those patients who would benefit from a more intense level of virtual assessment. We feel that there would be much to gain from instituting such processes within our project.",

However, when considering the advantages to those for whom conventional consultation opportunities are impacted significantly by hospital accessibility, we feel that video assessments may be used as a replacement method. This would of course be with the caveat that awareness is maintained regarding difficulty assessing postural symptoms and to a degree, the rigidity. If this method allows patients to make contact sooner, and more regularly, we hypothesize that overall health benefit could be greater in such circumstances.",
