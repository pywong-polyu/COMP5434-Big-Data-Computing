Most of the improvement was concentrated on post-neonatal mortality, which reduced at a rate of 8.1% per year from 1990 to 2007, whereas neonatal mortality reduced in a slower pace, 3.2% per year in the same period [3] . Thus, the proportion of neonatal mortality to mortality under the age of one has relatively increased, increasing from 49% in 1990 to 71% in 2015 [2] . Brazil has developed a new agenda, focused on actions to prevent neonatal mortality, to accelerate the reduction in infant mortality rates to as low as 10 deaths per 1000 live births by 2030, according to United Nations Sustainable Development Goals [4] .",

Neonatal sepsis is one of the main causes of hospitalization and death in neonatal intensive care units (NICU) [5] , and is considered healthcare-associated when infections are related to the care provided to pregnant women and neonates. There are two patterns of disease: early-onset neonatal sepsis (EOS) and late-onset neonatal sepsis (LOS). EOS is variably defined as occurring within 48-72 h after birth, and is related to care provided to women during gestation and delivery. In these cases, microorganisms are of maternal origin, acquired hours or days before or during delivery from the birth canal, and neonates may have a history of prolonged rupture of membranes, preterm onset of labor, chorioamnionitis, and peripartum maternal fever [6] . LOS is defined as occurring during 4-90 days of life, and is caused by microorganisms acquired during medical care and related to prematurity and low birth weight, prolonged use of intravascular access, mechanical ventilation, total parenteral nutrition, and exposure to broad spectrum antibiotics [7] .",

That triggered infection control policies, which culminated with a federal law making infection control compulsory in every hospital in the country in 1997 [9] . The first surveillance system for HAI in Brazil was developed in 2004, by the State of S\u00e3o Paulo, covering its territory [10] and in 2011 a national system was developed [11] . The system is dependent of notifications from a variety of hospitals, with different levels of complexity and no critical appraisal of the reliability and quality of the information reported has been performed so far. Moreover, as 98% of births occur in the hospital setting in Brazil [12] , and because of the expansion of neonatal intensive care in the country in the last decades, HAI may account for a large proportion of neonatal deaths attributable to infection. Therefore, we decided to conduct a comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis study, aiming to assess the incidence of neonatal HAI and identify their causative pathogens and their antimicrobial resistance profile in Brazilian NICU. This knowledge is essential to promote better policies and implement strategies to reduce neonatal mortality in the country.",

            "text": "This systematic review and meta-analysis study showed that endemic HAI represents a major burden and a safety issue for infants admitted in Brazilian NICU. A country-level estimate of neonatal HAI is reported, and pooled estimates showed that HAI incidence is 26.3% and BSI incidence density is 13.1 per 1000 CVC-day. The Brazilian Sanitary Agency has developed a network for HAI surveillance since 2011 that made the notification of HAI compulsory for every hospital in the country. Such a large surveillance system in such a diverse country is prone to inaccuracy due to the large variety of health services and their levels of complexity and capability to perform high quality surveillance. To date, there is no publicly available evaluation of this surveillance system that can critically appraise its results. According to its first report, with data from 2011, the BSI rate in Brazilian NICU was 22.9 per 1000 catheterdays [11] , and reached 7.5 per 1000 catheter-days in 2018 according to its last report, a decrease of 67.2%, but the 90th percentile was still 15.5 per 1000 catheterdays [31] . This figure is lower than the pooled rate observed in the present study; however, the comparison of actual rates with our estimates are inadequate because our study spans a long period, from the initial milestones of hospital infection control in Brazil: the first reported outbreaks in nurseries, the first national HAI survey and legislation in the mid-1990s to the present day. During this period, there were several changes in the HAI definitions for surveillance and many advances in their control, with infection rates gradually decreasing. The data shown here are similar to those from the International Nosocomial Infection Control Consortium (INICC), which involved 48 NICU from middle-and low-income countries (18 from Latin America) and showed a pooled mean of 16.37 BSI per 1000 CVC-days [32] . Nevertheless, the figures presented here are higher than the average incidence rates in developed countries. In American NICU, the HAI rates were 1.3 BSI per 1000 CVC-days and 0.9 VAP per 1000 ventilator-days [33] . In Germany, among very low birth weight infants, BSI incidence density rates were 8.6 per 1000 CVC-days and 2.7 VAP per 1000 ventilator-days [34] . Bloodstream was the most common site of infection, as reported elsewhere. Infants rarely manifest sepsis as a focal infection, which hinders the definition of a focal infection as pneumonia, for example. Possibly, the BSI rates are overestimated, and better definition of HAI in the neonatal period remains a challenge. Low prevalence of necrotizing enterocolitis, meningitis, and surgical site infection (SSI) was found. The possible explanation is that the surveillance definitions only consider necrotizing enterocolitis when there is a radiologic finding of intestinal wall suffering, excluding less severe cases. For meningitis, no study has reported the frequency of lumbar puncture, and if this is not an established practice in the NICU, many meningitis may go undetected, especially in very low birth weight infants. As for SSI, it was not reported whether the NICU performed surgery, as only NICU with high level of complexity perform neonatal surgery.",

We acknowledge that this may risk losing potential articles to the systematic review, thus the procedure was carefully done twice. There was absence of representation of large geographic areas of Brazil due to the simple lack of reported data. We believe that HAI incidence may be underestimated, because more organized services, which are capable of performing high quality surveillance with better results, usually report their data. Moreover, there was a large heterogeneity between the studies, especially regarding sample size and the criteria used to define HAI. Some studies used the American National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) criteria from the CDC [36] , while others used the Brazilian criteria from ANVISA [37] . Both criteria are similar, but the ANVISA criteria is more specific for clinical BSI because, in the absence of a positive blood culture, it defines sepsis according to a score using white blood cell count and reactive C protein despite physician prescription of antibiotics, unlike the CDC criteria. To cope with heterogeneity between studies, we preferred to apply a quality-effects estimator for meta-analysis, because unlike random-effects model, quality-effects method allows to incorporate study quality assessments into the pooled estimates. Furthermore, the quality-effects model leads to the maintenance of the correct coverage probability of the confidence interval, regardless of the level of heterogeneity, as well as a lower observed variance compared to the random effects model [38, 39] . As there is no quality score for studies addressing neonatal HAI, we decided to create our own score based on objective parameters. This quality score was aimed at simplicity and ease of application and reproducibility by different researchers. Similar approaches using MetaXL qualityeffects models have been used successfully in different studies [40] . Moreover, the quality-effects model is robust to subjectivity in quality assessment because it tolerates a fair amount of variability in reproducibility related to who assesses the quality of the studies. The reason is the way quality information is used; it does not require any information on the direction and magnitude of the bias induced by quality deficiencies. The credibility rank is the relative probability that the study is credible related to the best study in the meta-analysis, thus scale independent. Previous studies have demonstrated that despite a wide variation in the quality of input studies, the error and coverage of the estimator remain superior to the random-effects model [38, 39] . Thus, to improve neonatal infection research and promote transparency, clarity, and comparability of scientific reporting, urgent standards and criteria to report neonatal infection are needed to synthetize robust evidence to inform public health interventions. A recent extension of the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) statement has been published for Newborn Infection (STROBE-NI), which can be useful in the coming years [41] .",

This is especially important in Brazil, where preterm birth has increased over the past years, reaching 11.9% of all births [42] , twice the percentage observed in developed countries (5.5%) [43] . Improving antenatal care, with special attention to poverty-related maternal conditions, such as infections during pregnancy, preeclampsia, gestational diabetes, vaginal bleeding, low body mass index, smoking, and alcohol or drug abuse would reduce preterm birth. Moreover, a decrease in the number of Caesarean sections would also contribute to reduce preterm birth in Brazil, where the rate of this type of delivery is one of the highest in the world (55%) [44] . Additionally, there is an enormous gap between HAI rates in developed and developing countries, where there are constraints in staff and shortage of supplies and resources [45] . In middle-income countries as Brazil, where most births occur in the hospital setting and tertiary neonatal care with high rate of invasive device use has become more accessible, national estimates of HAI incidence can assist with prioritizing and evaluating effectiveness control measures such as quality improvement methods aimed at HAI prevention, including hand hygiene compliance, BSI prevention bundles, safe surgery, and antimicrobial stewardship programs.
