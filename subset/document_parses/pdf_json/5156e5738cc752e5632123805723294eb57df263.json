Diagnostic delays are more likely among children, people living with human immunodeficiency virus and those with extrapulmonary manifestations of tuberculosis, reflecting the inadequacy of currently available diagnostic tests to detect paucibacillary and extrapulmonary disease. In addition to diagnostic delay, the diagnosis of tuberculosis can be delayed by patient delay, which is defined as time from onset of tuberculosis symptoms to seeking care. Unemployment, low income, low education level, pulmonary abnormalities, living with human immunodeficiency virus and seeking initial care from an informal provider have been associated with patient delay [5] . Female sex has consistently been associated with a longer overall time to tuberculosis diagnosis; this has most recently been demonstrated among patients referred to a large tuberculosis referral hospital in China [6] .",

This affects especially citizens who live on the periphery, where diagnostic delays may be most severe and often adequate diagnostic equipment is not available. In contrast, in countries with low incidence of tuberculosis, with adequate financing of health care and availability of modern laboratory infrastructure, diagnostic delay is a common phenomenon because of low awareness about tuberculosis among physicians and other health-care providers [8] .",

In some high-burden countries, such as Namibia or Papua New Guinea, results of second-line phenotypic drug susceptibility testing are not available for decision-makers for months because bacterial cultures have to be shipped out of the country to distant reference laboratories for comprehensive drug susceptibility testing. Rapid molecular testing for the prediction of drug susceptibility or resistance is currently only readily available for one out of five WHO Group A and Group B priority drugs for the treatment of patients with multidrugresistant tuberculosis. Lack of proper drug susceptibility testing in patients with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis results in inadequate initiation of anti-tuberculosis treatment and has been associated with poor treatment outcomes in some settings [9, 10] , while the delay did not influence treatment outcomes in other settings [11, 12] .

At times of crisis, tuberculosis programmes are often hardest hit by disruptions. During war and natural disasters, patients find it difficult to access health-care facilities for diagnostic investigations or to receive their medicines, resulting in delayed diagnosis and interrupted treatment of tuberculosis. Migration and population displacement have played a historic role in the spread of tuberculosis over the centuries with migrants and refugees being among the most vulnerable groups for tuberculosis infection and disease because of their precarious living conditions [13] . Recent evidence from England specifically demonstrates that language barriers were associated with a 40% longer presentation delay [14] . Following England's introduction of the Migrant Cost Recovery Programme, which increased the cost for migrants to receive health care, the median time to tuberculosis treatment increased by 20 days among migrants [15] .",

However, technologies like the Xpert MTB/RIF\u00ae assay are not universally available in less affluent regions at the locations where the diagnosis of tuberculosis should be made.
