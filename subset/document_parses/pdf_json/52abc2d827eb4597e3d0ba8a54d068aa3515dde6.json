We consider two testing regimes (10-day and 5day cadences) and three screening testing regime start dates (Feb. 15, March 1, and March 15, 2021) . The rapid test we consider is modeled on Innova Medical Group's rapid antigen test, for which we assume a specificity of 99.5% and a sensitivity of 90%. We assume that 50% of those testing positive on the screening test receive a confirmatory PCR test, and that the self-isolation adherence rate for those testing positive on the antigen test, but not taking a confirmatory PCR test, is 50%. Table 1 presents estimates of the economic and mortality impacts of hypothetical screening test programs (relative to a baseline with no additional screening tests). Panel A considers screening test programs with a 10-day cadence; that is, approximately 33 million tests per day. Panel B considers a program with a 5-day cadence, and panel C considers a 3-day cadence. Each row corresponds to a different roll-out date. The screening and diagnostic tests are assumed to cost $5 and $50, respectively. All results are shown relative to a benchmark of no federal screening testing program.",

In reality, different groups have different contact rates, and if the testing is targeted to those with the highest contacts, the effects of the same number of tests, but targeted, would be greater than reported here. Second, we assume that the vaccine efficacy rate is also the rate of reduction of transmissibility. If the vaccine allows mild cases with transmission, then it will take longer to control the pandemic and the testing program will be more valuable. Third, we allow for the B.1.17 variant to be more contagious but not more deadly, nor do we allow for more deadly variants, nor do we allow for reduced vaccine efficacy against those variants. If any of those assumptions are wrong, the pandemic would take longer to eliminate and testing would be more valuable.",

All but the deceased compartments are differentiated by testing status (awaiting a screening test result, awaiting a diagnostic test result, or positive and self-isolating). Screening tests are given randomly to the non-symptomatic. Diagnostic tests are given to the symptomatic and are offered as a confirmatory test to those who test positive on the screening test. Because the screening test has imperfect specificity, the positive predictive value of a screening test can be low (typical values are 5%-25% for the parameter values considered here), so adherence to self-isolation is modeled as being partial in response to a positive screening test. The screening (antigen) test is assumed to be sensitive only to those infected, whereas the diagnostic (PCR) test is taken to be sensitive both to the infected and to the recently recovered.

The federal screening testing programs make screening testing available to all non-vaccinated individuals at a specified rate (once every 5 or 10 days). Those who test positive on the screening test are offered a (free) confirmatory PCR test; we assume that 90% of screening-positives take a confirmatory PCR test. All additional testing costs are paid by the federal government. The screening test is assumed to exhibit 99.5% specificity and 90% sensitivity, and a marginal cost of $5 per test. Note that in our model, the concept of test sensitivity corresponds to the share of those who are truly infectious who would test positive on a screening test. In practice, true infectiousness at a point in time is difficult to measure, and there is a large body of evidence suggesting that the gold-standard PCR tests can detect viral genetic sequences even after an individual has ceased to become infectious. We assume 50% adherence for those testing positive on the screening test and not taking a confirmatory PCR test. We assume that PCR confirmatory tests exhibit 99.9% sensitivity, 99.7% specificity, and a marginal cost of $50/test.

The literature on COVID seasonality is limited because COVID has not existed for a full seasonal cycle. IHME (2020) calibrated COVID seasonality using pneumonia seasonality. We rely instead on regression estimates of COVID seasonality in Tzampoglou and Loukidis (2020), who use country-level data from March through May 2020. Their estimates imply fluctuations in deaths of 21% to 32% as a result of temperature variation across the full range of cross-country temperatures. We adopt the approximate midpoint of this range and use a 25% full seasonal fluctuation in transmissibility, which we approximate as a seasonal cosine peaking on January 1, a pattern consistent with Merow and Urban (2020) .",

            "text": "Second, we reestimated the model using daily U.S. deaths data (7-day moving average) from March 15, 2020 through Nov. 10, 2020. The simulation period runs from Nov. 7, 2020 through July 1, 2022. The ADMS model uses a nonparametric flexible functional form to fit unobserved self-protective behavior such as masking and social distancing, specifically on a Type-II cosine expansion with three terms. The ADMS parameter estimation sample was March 15 -June 12, 2020. For the longer sample used here, we added two more terms to the Type-II cosine expansion. Also, the ADMS model calibrated protections for the elderly, however the longer sample afforded sufficient data to estimate a separate factor multiplying the cosine expansion to apply to the oldest age group, 75+. In all the model used here has 8 estimated parameters: the number of infections on February 21, 2020, the initial transmissibility rate per adult contact (equivalently, the initial R0), the five parameters of the cosine expansion, and the elderly protection factor. Third, the behavioral feedback rule was updated. ADMS considered two behavioral response rules from deaths to economic activity: the calibrated rule used in Baqaee, Farhi, Mina, and Stock (2020) and a simpler rule estimated by Arnon, Ricco, and Smetters (2020) . Both those feedback rules are based on data from Spring 2020. A plausible concern is that the response of economic activity to the prevalence of the virus diminished as individuals adapt and experience lockdown fatigue. Here, we therefore adopt a behavioral rule in which economic activity depends on the current death rate (as in Arnon, Ricco, and Smetters (2020) ), where the feedback parameter is estimated so that an exogenous disappearance of the virus would bring labor hours, as a fraction of potential, to a specified level. 3",
