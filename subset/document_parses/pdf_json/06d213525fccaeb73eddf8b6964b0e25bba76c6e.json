In addition, AI based quantification of GGO and consolidation volume were also performed. 123 patients (mean age: 64.43 \u00b1 14.02; 62 males) were included. GGO + consolidation was more frequently revealed in progressto-severe group whereas pure GGO was more likely to be found in non-severe group.

Among imaging parameters, consolidation volume had the largest area under curve (AUC) in discriminating non-severe from progress-to-severe group (AUC = 0.796, p < 0.001) and patients with or without critical events (AUC = 0.754, p < 0.001). According to multivariate regression, consolidation volume and age were two strongest predictors for disease progression (hazard ratio: 1.053 and 1.071, p: 0.006 and 0.008) whereas age and diabetes were predictors for unfavorable outcome. Consolidation volume quantified on initial chest CT was the strongest predictor for disease severity progression and larger consolidation volume was associated with unfavorable clinical outcome.",

Disease severity was evaluated according to the 6th edition of diagnosis and treatment protocols of pneumonia caused by novel coronavirus, issued by Chinese centers for disease control and prevention 14 . Patients with confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 were classified into four types as described below: (1) mild, patients with mild symptoms and no imaging finding of pneumonia; (2) moderate, patients with fever, respiratory symptoms and imaging findings of pneumonia; (3) severe, patients met any of the following conditions (a. respiratory distress, respiratory rate \u2265 30 times/min; b. SpO 2 < 93% at rest; c. PaO2/ FiO2 \u2264 300 mmHg; d. rapid progression of disease involvement [more than 50%] on chest CT within 24 ~ 48 h ); (4) critical, patients met any of the following conditions (a. respiratory failure and need mechanical assistance; b. shock; c. \"extra pulmonary\" organ failure, d. intensive care unit [ICU] is needed). For further analysis, patients were grouped as \"non-severe\" (classified as mild or moderate type) and \"progress-to-severe\" (classified as severe or critical type) according to the most severe classification during hospitalization. www.nature.com/scientificreports/ In addition, the mortality rate and rate of critical conditions (a. respiratory failure and need mechanical assistance; b. shock; c. \"extra pulmonary\" organ failure, d. ICU stay) were also recorded. Patients were considered event-free if they survived without occurrence of the above critical conditions. Statistical analysis. Statistical analysis was performed with a commercially available statistical software (MedCalc Statistical Software version 15.2.2, MedCalc Software BVBA, Ostend, Belgium). Quantitative variables were expressed as mean \u00b1 standard deviation (SD). Student's t test was used for normally distributed data, and the Mann-Whitney U test for non-normally distributed data. Categorical variables were reported as count (%), and compared by the Fisher exact test or chi-square test. Interobserver agreement of CT semi-quantitative score and AI assisted quantification was assessed by intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). The Dice coefficient was used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning algorithms. Logistic regression model was used to calculate the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve for different CT parameters. ROC analysis was performed by the method developed by Hanley and McNeil 15 . The area under curve (AUC) of each parameter was calculated and the optimal cutoff values for all parameters were determined by the Youden index, the maximum sum of sensitivity and specificity. To ascertain the associations of CT-derived semi-quantitative and quantitative parameters with disease severity progression and clinical outcome, we performed univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses, which was performed by using the \"stepwise\" approach. The model included variables with p < 0.20 in the univariate analysis. A two-tailed P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.",

As for subgroup analysis, GGO + consolidation was more frequently revealed in progress-to-severe group whereas pure GGO was more likely to be found in non-severe group (Table 2) . Moreover, patients in progress-to-severe group had higher incidence of pleural effusion, nodule and larger number of involved lobes ( Table 2) . www.nature.com/scientificreports/ In terms of CT semi-quantitative score and AI assisted quantification, both methods had excellent interobserver agreement (ICC for CT score: 0.897, 95% CI 0.875-0.921; ICC for GGO quantification: 0.931, 95% CI 0.899-0.958; ICC for consolidation quantification: 0.972, 95% CI 0.951-0.998; all p < 0.001). The regions of lesion (pneumonia) were reliably segmented by AI assisted quantification, with a Dice coefficient of 0.845 (CI 0.751-0.944, p = 0.005).

The GGO volume percentage and consolidation volume percentage was also significantly higher in severe group ( www.nature.com/scientificreports/ Correlation of CT-derived parameters with disease severity progression and clinical outcome. ROC curve analysis and logistic regression was performed to determine the predictive value of CTderived parameters for prediction of disease severity progression. As shown by ROC analysis, consolidation volume and consolidation volume percentage had the largest AUC in discriminating non-severe from progressto-severe group (Fig. 4) . AI assisted quantification outperformed CT semi-quantitative score for identifying patients progressing to severe group with higher diagnostic accuracy, sensitivity and specificity (Table 3) . www.nature.com/scientificreports/ According to univariate analysis, consolidation volume and consolidation volume percentage were the strongest predictors for disease severity progression among all imaging parameters, followed by CT severity score and GGO volume percentage. After the adjustment by multivariate regression, consolidation volume and age remained as the strongest predictors (hazard ratio: 1.053 and 1.071, p: 0.006 and 0.008) ( Table 4 ). In terms of prognosis evaluation, 34 patients experienced the occurrence of at least one critical event. Similar to the above results, consolidation volume and consolidation volume percentage had the largest AUC in discriminating patients with and without critical events (Table 3) . However, according to multivariate analysis, only age and diabetes were the significant predictors for unfavorable clinical outcomes (Table 4 ).",

According to the current findings, this AI based quantification was not only beneficial for disease diagnosis but also for prognosis evaluation. Compared to conventional clinical characteristics, consolidation volume on initial chest CT was the strongest predictor for progress-to-severe group. Although GGO is the commonest finding on chest CT, consolidation has been reported to be more frequently presented in cases of severe and critical type 18, 19 . Similar to other types of viral pneumonia, the underlying pathology of consolidation in the setting of COVID-19 could correlated to the complete filling of alveoli by inflammatory exudation 20 . When necrotizing bronchitis and diffuse alveolar damage occurs in the setting of viral pneumonia, the ventilation function is seriously compromised 21 . Therefore, it is conceivable that patients with larger area of consolidation on initial chest CT are more likely to progress to severe or critical clinical conditions. Another important finding of the present study was the superiority of AI assisted quantification over conventional CT severity score for prediction of disease progression. The semi-quantitative CT score was first introduced in the evaluation of disease severity of severe acute respiratory syndrome 12 . However, this score does not take different lesion components, such as consolidation and GGO, into account. According to the current results, consolidation volume carried more significant predictive value that did GGO volume. Further, CT severity score roughly assesses the overall extent of disease according to involved zones. It is unable to distinguish mildly discrepant lesion severity when involvement difference is less than 25% within one zone. The latter one can only be evaluated by AI-assisted quantification. Thus, precise evaluation of absolute quantification based on different lesion characteristics is more helpful than CT semi-quantitative score in terms of risk stratification in patients with COVID-19. Similar findings can also be observed from one previous AI-based chest CT study, which found that percentage of consolidation volume and other CT quantified lesion parameters can early and non-invasively predict the progression to severe illness 22 .",
