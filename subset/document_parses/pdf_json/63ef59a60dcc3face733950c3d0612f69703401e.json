It is also possible that the fetal thymus tissue was too small to reconstitute a human infant [7] . The use of fetal thymus carried the risk of fatal graft versus host disease since mature T-cells can be found in the human thymus by the end of the first trimester [3] .

The one exception in the author's series is one subject who had complete DiGeorge anomaly associated with ectodermal dysplasia. This subject developed na\u00efve T-cells and a polyclonal repertoire but has not been able to mount antigen-specific responses. This subject has had significant viral infections requiring prolonged hospitalizations.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Clinical Outcomes"}, {"text": "Autoimmune disease is a frequent complication after thymus transplantation found in 42% of subjects over 1 year post transplantation. Of the 31 infants who are more than 1 year after transplantation, 8 (26%) have developed autoimmune thyroid disease and are on replacement therapy. One of these infants developed alopecia totalis, which has not been responsive to therapy. A second of these infants with thyroid disease had previously developed nephrotic syndrome which responded to a 2-month course of steroids. (A renal biopsy was not performed.) Three additional subjects had transient episodes of thrombocytopenia. Two subjects developed autoimmune hemolytic anemia associated with viral infections. One of the subjects with anemia subsequently developed autoimmune hepatitis. These complications have responded to treatment. The one subject who developed autoimmune hemolytic anemia associated with HHV6 infection followed by autoimmune hepatitis continues on immunosuppression. These adverse events should be considered in the context of the high background of autoimmune disease in DiGeorge anomaly and in other primary immunodeficiencies such as severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID). Six subjects enrolled in transplantation protocols in the Duke series developed thyroid disease prior to transplantation. Thyroid disease has been described in partial DiGeorge anomaly [52] [53] [54] [55] and in SCID after bone marrow transplantation [56] . Autoimmune cytopenias are a common and often severe complication of partial DiGeorge anomaly [57] [58] [59] . It is not clear at this time whether the autoimmune disease seen after transplantation is secondary to defective thymopoiesis or to the underlying genetic background of the recipient. Interestingly, neonatal thymectomy in an animal has been shown to increase the rate of spontaneous thyroiditis [60] , suggesting that the mass of the thymus may be important for preventing thyroid disease. The most severe adverse event occurred in the subject who received the largest dose of thymus tissue (23 g/m 2 body surface area). This subject presented with atypical complete DiGeorge anomaly. Most of the circulating T-cells were double negative (CD3 + CD4 -CD8 -). Large expansions of TCRBV3 + T-cells were observed. Five months after transplantation, CD4 + T-cells became the predominant population and the TCRBV repertoire normalized, suggesting that T-cells were emerging from the thymus. No na\u00efve T-cells were detected. At the same time the subject developed severe unrelenting enteritis and colitis. This condition required high doses of immunosuppression to reverse. The subject died from a fungal infection, likely related to the steroid therapy. Because of this adverse event the maximum dose of tissue was lowered to 18 g/m 2 body surface area.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1380, "end": 1384, "text": "[52]", "ref_id": "BIBREF52"}, {"start": 1385, "end": 1389, "text": "[53]", "ref_id": "BIBREF53"}, {"start": 1390, "end": 1394, "text": "[54]", "ref_id": "BIBREF54"}, {"start": 1395, "end": 1399, "text": "[55]", "ref_id": "BIBREF55"}, {"start": 1446, "end": 1450, "text": "[56]", "ref_id": "BIBREF56"}, {"start": 1546, "end": 1550, "text": "[57]", "ref_id": "BIBREF57"}, {"start": 1551, "end": 1555, "text": "[58]", "ref_id": "BIBREF58"}, {"start": 1556, "end": 1560, "text": "[59]", "ref_id": "BIBREF59"}, {"start": 1858, "end": 1862, "text": "[60]", "ref_id": "BIBREF60"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Clinical Outcomes"}, {"text": "All 31 subjects who are now more than 1 year after transplantation have developed na\u00efve T-cells with the exception of DIG208 who remains on immunosuppression for autoimmune hepatitis (Fig. 30.4) .
