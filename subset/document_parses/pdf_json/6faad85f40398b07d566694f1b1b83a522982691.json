This finding corresponds with the data from other cohorts. The overall incidence of AKI in ICU patients ranged from 20% to 50%, higher than those of non-ICU patients. 20 Depending on the diagnoses and comorbidities, lower incidence of AKI was seen in elective surgical patients while patients with sepsis had the highest incidence of AKI. 20 In our study, although critically ill patients had higher mortality than hospitalized patients, the difference, however, was not statistically significant. This could be resulted from an important limitation. Studies that included hospitalized patients with COVID-19 did not report the mortality in general inpatients and critically ill patients separately. Thus, one could argue that the true mortality in non-critically ill patients should be lower than what we reported here. The underlying etiology of AKI is likely multifactorial. Systemic inflammation, sepsis, hemodynamic instability or concurrent use of diuretics may lead to pre-renal azotemia or acute tubular necrosis (ATN). In critically ill patients, it may be necessary to do radiographic studies with iodinated contrast which could lead to contrast-induced AKI. Additionally, thrombotic microangiopathy leading to ATN is also possible, particularly given that recent evidence suggests that patients with COVID-19 are at greater risk of experiencing thromboembolic events. 21 The use of broadspectrum empirical antibiotics especially in high doses may also lead to ATN and interstitial nephritis. Initial treatment regimens, such as lopinavir-ritonavir, high-dose oseltamivir or high-dose hydroxychloroquine may contribute to the development of AKI as well. 22 23 However, newer therapeutic breakthroughs, such as remdesivir (NCT04292730, NCT04323761), tocilizumab (NCT04317092), favipiravir (NCT04310228), sarilumab (NCT04327388), sirolimus (NCT04341675) and combined hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin (NCT04329832) are being investigated and we are optimistic to see how these treatments improve the clinical outcomes of patients with COVID-19 and the incidence of AKI. Furthermore, it is possible that the virus itself can infect podocytes and renal tubular cells leading to nephrotoxicity and AKI based on a human cell study model. 24 Some studies also reported that viral RNA was detectable in urine of the infected patients. 25 26 However, whether these findings correlate with the pathogenesis remains unproven.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 306, "end": 308, "text": "20", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 478, "end": 480, "text": "20", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 1518, "end": 1520, "text": "21", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 1803, "end": 1808, "text": "22 23", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2383, "end": 2385, "text": "24", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 2478, "end": 2483, "text": "25 26", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Original research"}, {"text": "Our meta-regression analyses demonstrated that the incidence of AKI was associated with increased mortality in patients with COVID-19 after adjustment for age and sex but not with adjustment for additional variables, such as hypertension, diabetes and baseline serum creatinine level.

However, our findings are comparable to what was previously described during SARS-CoV outbreak. Up to 91.7% of SARS-CoV-infected patients with acute renal impairment died and the relative risk for mortality from acute renal impairment was 16.91 (95% CI 8.37 to 34.16; p<0.001). 18 However, although we reported an OR of 13.3-fold for mortality from AKI, this crude OR was unadjusted for other variables due to statistical limitation.

However, given the current situation of SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, available data from clinical trials are limited. Second, the pooled mortality in our study was higher than what previously reported by the WHO. This could be secondary to selection bias as AKI was mainly described in critically ill patients. Third, stages and etiologies of AKI were not identified in all studies. One could argue that worsening stages of AKI are likely to be associated with higher mortality. Additionally, the included studies provided limited data on the characteristics of patients with AKI, such as urine output status, and the need for dialysis. This information is crucial to determine the severity and recoverability of AKI. Fourth, the majority of included patients were Asian race as these studies were originated from China. Certainly, there are some concerns that the data obtained from these studies may be incomplete due to ethical issues or lack of adequate follow-up duration especially in the early phase of the pandemic. Fifth, the definition for AKI was not uniformly described in every study. Sixth, there were insufficient data to conduct the survival analysis since most studies did not provide the data on the time to death. Moreover, the incidence of RRT may be under-represented at some facilities due to medical staff and/or equipment shortage.
