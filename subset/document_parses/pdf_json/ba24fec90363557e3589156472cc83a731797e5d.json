Previous pandemics, such as the 2003 SARS outbreak in China, have demonstrated the ability to cause increased stress to healthcare students, highlighting the need for additional support for this population during public health crises. 9 While the impact of the covid-19 pandemic on healthcare workers is well documented, the effect of this public health crisis on the mental health of medical school students in the United States has not been sufficiently studied. The current study aims to assess the prevalence of anxiety and depression by screening medical students for GAD and major depressive disorder (MDD) in the era of Covid-19.",
