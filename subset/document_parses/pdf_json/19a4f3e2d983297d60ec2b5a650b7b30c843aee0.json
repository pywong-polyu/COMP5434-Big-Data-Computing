The disease is most frequently caused by the Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV), followed by other viruses such as rhinovirus, metapneumovirus, seasonal coronavirus, human bocavirus, (para) influenza and adenovirus [4] . Every year, in early autumn, paediatric departments worldwide prepare for the 'bronchiolitis season', as a sharp increase in admissions is seen around that time. Global surveillance data suggest that this seasonal pattern is mainly explained by meteorological factors and that transmission is facilitated by indoor crowding [2, 4] . As for other common childhood infections, bronchiolitis is believed to spread in nurseries and schools [4] .",

Which of these two transmission routes (droplets vs. aerosols) is dominant, is still being debated (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/more/ scientific-brief-sars-cov-2.html). For viruses that can cause bronchiolitis, the generally accepted transmission routes are droplets and contact, either direct contact or indirect contact through an intermediate surface/object (referred to as fomites) [4] . Enveloped viruses (like coronaviruses and influenza) more easily adapt to a new host and therefore have more 'pandemic potential', but are normally more 'fragile' and therefore less likely to cause infection via contact with fomites. Both RSV (an enveloped virus as well) and coronaviruses can however survive on surfaces from hours to days [5] . The COVID-19 pandemic is a unique opportunity to get insight into the dynamics of various other infectious diseases, including bronchiolitis.",

            "text": "Belgium is currently experiencing its second COVID-19 'lockdown' since November 2 nd . Households can only receive one visitor and public gatherings of >4 people are not allowed. Non-essential shops were closed until Dec 1 st . Bars and restaurants will be closed, at least until February 2021. In warehouses and public buildings, people >12 years old have to wear a face mask. These measures have an important impact on the lives of adults, but Belgium followed the recommendation of its Paediatric COVID-19 Task Force, to limit the impact of the second lockdown measures on children [11] . Nurseries and schools remained mostly open and the impact on children's after school activities was limited. Our data suggest that infectious diseases like bronchiolitis do not become real epidemics when transmission is inhibited by NPIs, practised by adults and older children. These findings shed new light on Infection Prevention and Control (IPC) measures that could reduce the burden on our health care systems in future bronchiolitis seasons. On the other hand, it is known that early childhood offers an opportunity to build immunity. Apart from the younger population and the fact that people live more outside, one of the hypotheses for the lower incidence of COVID-19 in Sub-Saharan Africa is 'trained immunity' in younger individuals: prior exposure to other cross-reactive viruses could reduce SARS-CoV-2's morbidity [12] . It is too early to draw conclusions about the possible effect of COVID-19's NPIs on immunity against common (childhood) infections [11, 13] . However, if people get less exposed to infectious agents early in life, they might become more susceptible to (severe) disease later on. Another effect of the current NPIs is that the number of susceptible persons increases because of the absence of exposure. In Australia, where summer has already started and most COVID-19 NPIs have been discontinued, an unusually delayed and steeper 'summer bronchiolitis and RSV peak' is ongoing in certain regions, with an older median age and higher total numbers compared to the usual winter peaks (https://www.health.nsw.gov.au/Infectious/covid-19/ Documents/covid-19-surveillance-report-20201226.pdf). The Australian experience suggests the importance of adaptive immunity in RSV-at least in the short term-and could urge us to consider extending monthly palivizumab injections in those most at risk. It remains to be seen what will happen when hygiene/distance measures will be relaxed and prepandemic life will restart in Europe. The COVID-19 pandemic is a real live epidemiology lesson: to be continued.",
