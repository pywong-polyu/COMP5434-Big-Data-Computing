We sought to determine whether patients with COVID-19 and reduced LVGLS have an increased risk for mortality. The mean LVGLS was determined to be significantly lower in the non-survivors compared to the survivors (\u221211.6 \u00b1 1.8 vs \u221215.4 \u00b1 0.74, p<0.05). It should be noted, however, that even those that survived were found to have reduced LVGLS (<\u221218.5%). A multivariate logistic regression analysis was also performed that demonstrated a relationship between reduced LVGLS and an increased risk for mortality. Overall, our data indicate that COVID-19 patients may have subclinical left ventricular dysfunction, and that critically ill patients may have a greater decline in cardiac dysfunction.",

            "text": "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID- 19) , which is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is an ongoing pandemic that has affected millions globally. Although the most recognized clinical manifestations of COVID-19 are respiratory symptoms, some patients have been found to have cardiovascular damage without any clinical cardiac findings [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] . Studies have revealed that virus particles are present in the myocardium and vascular endothelium in patients with COVID-19. Therefore, it is necessary to study the long-term consequences on the cardiac function of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 [6, 7] . Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) remains an important imaging modality used for assessing cardiac function, which can provide relevant information that may impact clinical management for those infected with SARS-CoV-2 [8] . Left ventricular global longitudinal strain (LVGLS), measured by speckle tracking echocardiography (STE), provides a way to quantify myocardial deformation independent of left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) [9] . It has both diagnostic and prognostic capabilities and has known clinical applications in patients with left ventricular hypertrophy, valvular diseases, and cardiomyopathies. The reduction of absolute strain is known to signify a poor prognosis for some myocardial diseases and may signify a poor prognosis in other settings as well. Recent studies demonstrated that both left ventricular global longitudinal strain from the apical four-chamber views (LVGLS4CH) and right ventricular free wall longitudinal strain were predictors of mortality in patients with COVID-19 [10, 11] . Additional studies, however, suggest that only decreased right ventricular strain may be associated with poor prognosis in patients with COVID-19 [12, 13] . On the other hand, another study determined that reduced LVGLS was not associated with poor outcomes [14] . In this retrospective study, we sought to determine whether reduced LVGLS in patients with COVID-19 is associated with an increased risk for mortality.",

The software provided automated detection of the LV endocardial boundary, which was then edited, if needed, to conform to the visualized LV boundaries. The maximum negative value of strain during systole, as measured by the software, represented the maximum contractility for each segment. The average of these values from each segment was used to determine LVGLS. LVGLS was considered to be abnormal if <\u221218.5%. An example of LVGLS determination using STE is demonstrated in Figure 1 . One user-determined LVGLS for all patients included in this study to limit variability. The endpoint evaluated in this study was mortality during hospitalization. Continuous numeric variables were expressed as mean \u00b1 standard deviation (SD) and compared using a twosample Student's t-test in the two groups of patients: survivors and non-survivors. The Chi-square was used to compare the frequency of nominal data in the two groups. A multivariate logistic regression analysis was also performed to assess any predictors of mortality.

Interestingly, even those patients with COVID-19 that survived had on, average, decreased LVGLS. It should be noted, however, that a greater number of the non-survivors were noted to have reduced LVGLS. The mean LVGLS was significantly lower in the non-survivors as well. These data indicate that COVID-19 patients may have subclinical left ventricular dysfunction and that those that are critically ill may have a greater decline in cardiac dysfunction. These data are consistent with other studies that demonstrated a reduction in LVGLS in COVID-19 patients [16, 17] . In addition, we found that a reduced LVGLS was associated with an increased risk for mortality.",

Given the challenges technicians face in obtaining multiple apical views in such patients, future studies may benefit from studying LV GLS4CH. In addition, our study was conducted with one user determining LVGLS, limiting variability among the patients included in this study, but variation in LVGLS among different users may be expected. It should be noted, however, that studies have found that measurements of LVGLS are reproducible even across multiple readers, supporting the generalizability of this study [18] [19] [20] .",

Such findings demonstrate that LVGLS may be useful in determining the prognosis of COVID-19 patients. In addition, a considerable number of patients that survived were noted to have reduced LVGLS. Thus, for those that survive, continued cardiac function monitoring may be warranted.",
