Univariate analyses were performed to estimate the effect of different variables on acceptance of COVID-19 vaccination and are reported as odds ratio (OR) with 95% CI. To better understand certain subpopulations' vaccine acceptance rate, we performed crosswise analyses of a priori variables of interest (race, educational attainment, and influenza vaccine status). These factors were chosen based on prior literature and their utility for public health messaging. 4 ",

This finding suggests the need for different public health messaging in order to improve COVID-19 vaccination acceptance. In other words, education about COVID-19 vaccine safety in pregnancy is important, but an alternative approach may be necessary among Black or African American women due to their lived experiences with systemic racism and mistrust in the healthcare system. Pregnant women's primary concern regarding COVID-19 vaccination in pregnancy is safety, with nearly half declining vaccination for this reason. A parallel goal of ongoing vaccination trials in pregnant women must focus on shortand long-term safety data from vaccination in pregnancy.",
