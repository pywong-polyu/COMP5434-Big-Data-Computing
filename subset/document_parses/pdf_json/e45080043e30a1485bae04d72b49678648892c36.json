Using a two-stage transfer learning technique to train a convolutional neural network (CNN), we show that the algorithm is able to classify four classes of disease severity (normal, mild, moderate, and severe) with average area under curve (AUC) of 0.93. In addition, we show that the outputs of different layers of the CNN under dominant filters provide valuable insight about the subtle patterns in the CXRs, which can improve the accuracy in the reading of CXRs by a radiologist. Finally, we show that our approach can be used for studying the disease progression in single patients and its influencing factors. The results suggest that our technique can form the foundation of a more concrete clinical model to predict the evolution of COVID-19 severity and the efficacy of different treatments for each patient through using CXRs and clinical data in early stages. This will be essential in dealing with the upcoming waves of COVID-19 and optimizing resource allocation and treatment.",

However, it can rapidly cause pneumonia and lung opacity in patients resulting in a fatality or long-term damages to the lung [2] [3] [4] .

Prior to the availability of reversetranscription polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) tests, chest X-rays (CXRs) and computed tomography (CT) scans were used to diagnose COVID-19 [5, 6] . Chest imaging, CT in particular, shows a characteristic manifestation of COVID-19, even in patients with limited symptoms. However, this use of CT places a considerable burden on radiology departments and poses an immense challenge for infection control. There have also been many cases with positive COVID-19 without any pulmonary manifestations [7] . The significant efforts and advances to foster the development of cheaper, more accurate, faster, and easier-to-use test kits and the aforementioned reasons raise questions about using medical imaging as a tool for detecting the disease. Instead, these modalities can play a crucial role in determining the severity degree of the disease and understanding the dynamics of its development from mild to severe in different patients as well as predicting its evolution and assessing the efficacy of different treatments [2, 3, [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] , which are not feasible in RT-PCR and other laboratory test kits.",

The input CXR is fed into the CNN and will be processed by the network to extract the features and classify the severity degree of the disease. At each layer, the outputs of the most dominant CNN layers will be extracted and visualized using a pruning approach to understand the decision-making process. To monitor the progress of the disease, we reduce the dimensionality of the last fully connected layer using UMAP and use the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) to cluster the space into different severity regions. For series of input CXRs of a patient, we can visualize and monitor the progress of the disease over time.",

Despite being less sensitive than chest CT for diagnosis of COVID-19related pneumonia, especially in the early phases of the disease, CXRs are often being utilized in the first-line assessment of patients due to their affordability and accessibility. In its recent guideline, the American College of Radiography (ACR) recommends portable CXR in ambulatory care facilities over CTs [18] . The British Medical Journal (BMJ) Best Practice recommendations for COVID-19 management also endorses the use of CXR in all patients with suspected pneumonia [19] . A retrospective study by Wong H.Y.F. et al. [4] on 64 patients with an RT-PCR-confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis found that the most common COVID-19-related signs on CXRs were consolidation (47%) and ground-glass opacities (33%). These alterations mostly had a bilateral, peripheral, lower zone distribution and were rarely associated with pleural effusion. In their study, 69% of patients had CXR abnormalities on the baseline X-ray, and another 11% developed CXR alterations later on in the study. As a result, CXR can be a very effective modality for monitoring the progression of the disease and its effect on the pulmonary system. However, the increasing number of patients and the large number of CXRs burden an unprecedented workload on radiologists and calls for automatic severity prediction and monitoring systems more than any time.",

However, despite the unique opportunities enabled by AI, most existing works focus on classification and detection of COVID-19 [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] , rather than classifying the severity degree of the disease [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] and providing intuition about its potential evolution to enable a decision-making process, which can also facilitate unprecedented knowledge discovery in COVID-19.

The outputs of the corresponding CNN layers under these dominant filters are shown in Figs. 4a-p for an input CXR of a patient with severe COVID-19 pneumonia. Comparing the filters to our expert radiologist's perspective of the traditional CXRs shows that each filter highlights specific relevant parts of the CXRs similarly to the radiologist's workflow examination. The filters from the first block of the CNN (Figs. 4a-c) focus more on highlighting different parts of the image (e.g., lung area, lower body part, etc.).

Figures 2, 3 , and 5 clearly show that our algorithm can learn to assess the severity degree of COVID-19 similar to an expert radiologist. Our algorithm can also provide more features than a typical CXR using the outputs of the CNN layers under dominant filters as shown in Fig. 4 . Having these different views of a single CXR can help radiologists to better evaluate the severity of the disease. The accuracies obtained for the severity classification (Fig. 2) are good, especially knowing that the comparison is made with the labeling of only one expert radiologist. Aside from the actual classification accuracies, the separation of different severity classes in Fig. 5 clearly shows that our algorithm successfully distinguishes different classes with maximum spatial distance in the latent space between the normal and severe classes. It is also trivial why the errors in classifying mild and moderate classes are higher than those in the other two. A valuable use of the manifold-learning approach in Fig. 5 is the observation of the disease progression path for each patient. Interestingly we see that these patients take two different disease progression paths with different specifics. Patient 2, initially worsens, showing increasing signs of COVID-19-related pneumonia on sequential CXRs. However, after day 5, the patient starts recovering, showing improvement on CXRs and on day 20 is successfully discharged without re-admission. Patient 1 does not show this turning point and shows increasing disease severity on the CXRs and unfortunately dies. Understanding such turning points based on available data and relating them to the influencing factors on the disease progression are essential to create more insight into the disease trajectory to enable intelligent prediction of the disease evolution and assessment of treatment options for specific patients early on. Having more frequent CXRs for more patients will enable the algorithm to relate the dynamics of disease progression to the clinical data and treatment details. Combined with other clinical data for a patient, CXRs can provide valuable insight into the disease progression over time and the patient's response to treatments. This can also help us to develop a more concrete model to project at an early stage which patients might become in need for more intensive treatment and which patients are more likely to recover. AI approaches can use such data to learn these dynamics and predict the course of disease evolution for each patient. It can also be used to predict the best treatment approach at each stage of the disease.",

The aerated parts show different types of heterogeneity, caused by differences in air and fluid content. In these filters the lung fields and projected ribs are highlighted, which can help in understanding the COVID-19 disease, where we see an increased heterogeneity in the intensities of the lung fields, caused by pulmonary infiltrates. The deeper layers of the CNN extract more complex and difficult-tointerpret features (yet potentially more insightful) from the CXRs, and the final layers localize the ROIs in the image.
