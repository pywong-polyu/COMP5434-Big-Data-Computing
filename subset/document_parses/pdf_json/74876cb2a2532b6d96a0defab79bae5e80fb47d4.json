The usage of this imaging technique became even more widespread during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. The latest generation ultrasound scanners are conveniently portable and this permits ultrasound examinations to be performed even in extreme environments where no other diagnostic tool is available. Our team has developed the first guide that assists the clinician while operating in low-resource settings, in managing a SARS-CoV-2 patient based on the clinical examination and the LUS findings.",
