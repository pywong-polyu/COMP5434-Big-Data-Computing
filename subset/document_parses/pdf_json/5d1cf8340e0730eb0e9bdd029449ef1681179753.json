In mental health, the biggest enabler of digital solutions is the implementation of an effective model of care that is facilitated by integrated health information technologies (HITs); the latter ensuring the solution is easily accessible, scalable and sustainable. The University of Sydney's Brain and Mind Centre (BMC) has developed an innovative digital health solutiondelivered through the Youth Mental Health and Technology Programwhich incorporates two components: 1) a highly personalised and measurement-based (data-driven) model of youth mental health care; and 2) an industrial grade HIT registered on the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods. This paper describes a research protocol to evaluate the impact of implementing the BMC's digital health solution into youth mental health services (i.e. headspacea highly accessible, youth-friendly integrated service that responds to the mental health, physical health, alcohol or other substance use, and vocational concerns of young people aged 12 to 25 years) within urban and regional areas of Australia.",

To achieve this, centres are staffed by multidisciplinary teams to address the multidimensional needs of young people, comprising of clinical staff (e.g. psychiatrists, mental health nurses, GPs; allied health professionals such a psychologists, occupational therapists, social workers), and non-clinical staff (e.g. centre manager, clinical coordinator, community outreach worker, intake workers, etc) [7] a. The composition and capacity of these teams vary across headspace centres nationally, due to factors such as geographical location (e.g. unavailable workforce in rural locations), funding arrangements, and the fact that the provision of treatment and services offered by a headspace centre is determined by the community in which it is locatedi.e., headspace centres aim to reflect and serve the communities in which they are based. Despite the establishment of headspace, mental health outcomes for young people remain poor. For those who access care, a significant portion of young people receive an inappropriately low level of treatment for their needs [8] , show no improvement in functioning over time [9] , or deteriorate to a more serious stage of illness [10, 11] .",

Within these traditional models of service delivery, not all Australians have access to high quality mental health care, and access to care varies greatly across geographical locations [13] . For example, people living in non-urban (regional, rural, remote) areas of Australia have limited access to mental health care [14] due to barriers such as location of service, service opening hours, the issue of anonymity (particularly in small rural or remote communities), stigmatising attitudes, and cost [15] [16] [17] , and they experience higher self-harm, suicidal ideation, and suicide attempt rates than Australians living in urban areas [4] . Further, the quality and type of intervention received by a young person varies greatly across services and geographical locations [13] . There is limited communication and coordination between services, which leaves the young person navigating a disjointed mental health care system without support [18] .",

A rapid increase in reported mental health issues during the COVID-19 pandemic has added to service demand, which cannot be met by current traditional service delivery models of mental health care [19] . Moreover, this surge in service demand has resulted in a significant increase in contacts with digital mental health services (e.g. Mindspot, Lifeline), further highlighting the important role digital health can play in providing mental health care on a large scale [20] . Yet, this increase also illustrates the need for better models of care otherwise we risk bringing more people into an already overburdened mental health system. Thus, the adoption of a digital health model of care by mental health services, and a shift in the historically cautious attitudes of clinicians toward the use of digital technologies [19] , is now crucial in facilitating quality, timely, and easily accessible mental health care for all.",

HITs have been defined as 'the application of information processing involving both computer hardware and software that deals with the storage, retrieval, sharing, and use of health care information, data and knowledge for communication and decision making' [24] . HITs can be utilised in a variety of health care settings (e.g. private and public sectors, primary, secondary and hospital services), and examples of HITs include electronic health records, medical billing software, and clinical decision support (a data-analysis system designed to support health professionals to make clinical decisions). Previous research has identified the key uses of HITs as being the storage, management, and transmission of health data; clinical decision making support; and the facilitation of health care from a distance [25] . HITs are currently transforming both the healthcare system and the ability of consumers to self-manage aspects of their health and wellbeing through exercising greater choice and control in their own care [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] . For mental health service providers and health professionals who employ shared decision-making, HITs are also transforming the ways in which consumers can choose to become active participants and equal partners in their health care, shifting service delivery from an intervention model to an effective coordinated care model that is person-centred and quality-driven [29] [30] [31] [32] . The adoption of HITs in youth mental health services has already demonstrated their utility to improve access and triage to care, as well as communication between health professionals and consumers, particularly in regional, rural or remote settings [17] .",

            "text": "Researchers at The University of Sydney's Brain and Mind Centre (BMC) have developed the Youth Mental Health (YMH) and Technology Program which utilises an innovative digital health model of care to increase access to quality mental health care for young people, improve mental, physical and social outcomes for young people, and upskill the youth mental health workforce to confidently deliver quality care. This digital health solutiondelivered through the YMH and Technology Programincorporates two components. The first is our highly personalised and measurement-based (datadriven) model of youth mental health care (known as the BMC Youth Model) [33] , which has been developed from more than 10 years of clinical research from the BMC's Optymise Youth Cohort [11, 34] . The BMC Youth Model integrates a variety of clinical concepts, including a multidimensional assessment and outcomes framework (i.e. fostering holistic practice of mental health that considers other compounding comorbidities such as physical health), underlying pathophysiological mechanisms and illness trajectories (i.e. adopting a transdiagnostic framework that recognises that mental health conditions are rarely homogeneous), and clinical staging for mental health. Clinical staging models consider the spectrum of mental ill health and aim to place consumers on that continuum, from those with risk factors and symptoms or impairment (Stage 1a) or attenuated disorders (Stage 1b) through to those with discrete disorders or with persistent and recurrent syndromes (Stage 2+) [34] . Clinical stage separates young people based on differential risk of progression to more severe disorders and poorer outcomes, and is therefore an accurate and efficient guide to allocating care (i.e. a concept known as 'staged care') [35] . As a result of this research, the BMC Youth Model was subsequently translated into an education and training program [36] , and its core concepts developed as key functionalities within an innovative HIT known as the InnoWell Platform [23, 37] .",

Implementation Officers will have a background working in the provision of mental health services (either clinical or non-clinical [e.g. administrative, research-focussed]), and will be embedded into participating centres part-time, contingent upon the varying needs and capacities of the services. Other tasks of Implementation Officers will include acting as a point of contact for participating sites, managing the recruitment of participants, overseeing informed consent, distributing online surveys to participants, administering semi-structured interviews, and routinely completing the Implementation Officer Log. The Implementation Officer log is based on the Quality Implementation Framework [43] , and will be used to monitor changes in implementation, reimagined service pathways, and staff roles related to the digital health solution. Importantly, Implementation Officers are not making any observations about centre staff specifically (e.g. performance), but rather the processes of implementing the digital health solution within participating headspace centres. Implementation Officers will complete logs fortnightly through REDCap, a secure web application for building and managing online surveys and databases [44, 45] . Table 1 provides an example of the range of questions included in the Implementation Officer log, a full version of the log is provided in Additional file 1: Appendix A.",
