We investigate the association between body mass index (BMI) and COVID-19 mortality across different ethnic groups using linked national Census, electronic health records and mortality data for adults in England from the start of pandemic (January 2020) to December 2020. There were 30,067 (0.27%), 1,208 (0.29%), 1,831 (0.29%), 845 (0.18%) COVID-19 deaths in white, Black, South Asian and other ethnic minority groups, respectively. Here we show that BMI was more strongly associated with COVID-19 mortality in ethnic minority groups, resulting in an ethnic risk of COVID-19 mortality that was dependant on BMI. The estimated risk of COVID-19 mortality at a BMI of 40 kg/m 2 in white ethnicities was equivalent to the risk observed at a BMI of 30.1 kg/m 2 , 27.0 kg/m 2 , and 32.2 kg/m 2 in Black, South Asian and other ethnic minority groups, respectively.",

In a study of 65,932 in-patients admitted with COVID-19 7 , a coding of obesity was associated with a higher risk of intensive care, mechanical ventilation or in-hospital mortality in all ethnic groups, but with the greatest risk observed in Black ethnicities with obesity 7 . A community study of 6.9 million adults from general practices in England also found the association between BMI and COVID-19 mortality at the start of pandemic was strongest in Black ethnicities 6 . However, whilst ethnicity has been shown to modify associations between BMI and COVID-19 outcomes, previous research has not quantified how this interaction affects both within-ethnicity and between-ethnicity risk across the spectrum of BMI. An early analysis of 5,623 community and in-hospital test results suggested the potential importance of this by showing the risk of SARS-CoV-2 positivity was not different between ethnic groups at low BMI, but was over twofold higher in ethnic minority groups compared to white ethnicities at high BMI 11 . This has not been explored in larger representative community cohorts or with COVID-19 outcomes.",

However, compared to white ethnicities, the J-shaped association were steeper in Black, South Asian and other ethnic minority groups (P < 0.001 for interaction) (Fig. 1A , with specific values highlighted in Table 2 There are 32,844 Lower Super Output Area (LSOA) areas in England, with a mean population of 1500 and a minimum of 1000. We calculated density as LSOA population divided by LSOA area. Household deprivation is defined across four dimensions: employment (at least one household member is unemployed or with long-term sickness, not including full-time students); education (no household member has at least Level 2 education, and no one aged 16-18 years is a full-time student); health and disability (at least one household member reported their health status as being 'bad'/ 'very bad' or has a long-term health problem); and housing (the household's accommodation is overcrowded, with an occupancy rating \u22121 or less, or is in a shared dwelling, or has no central heating). Approximate Social Grade is a socio-economic classification based on the occupation, employment, qualification, and tenure of the household reference person. Key worker type is defined based on the occupation and industry code. 'Exposure to disease' and 'proximity to others' are derived from the O*NET database, which collects a range of information about individual working conditions linked to specific occupational codes. To calculate the proximity and exposure measures, the questions asked were: (i) How physically close to other people are you when you perform your current job? (ii) How often does your current job require that you be exposed to diseases or infection? Scores ranging from 0 (no exposure) to 100 (maximum exposure) were calculated based on these questions. Health data were extracted from primary care records, apart from solid organ transplant and stroke which were extracted from hospital records. When analysis was repeated using a broader range of ethnic classification, the pattern of results mirrored the main finding with South Asian ethnicities (Bangladeshi and Pakistani) having the greatest risk at higher BMI ( Supplementary Fig. 7) . White ethnicities had the lowest risk. However, Chinese ethnicities may not reflect the wider trend for other ethnic minority groups, with associations similar to white ethnicities.",

The interaction between BMI and ethnicity with COVID-19 mortality revealed an ethnic risk that was also dependant on BMI. There was no difference in risk between Black and other ethnic minority groups compared to white ethnicities at a low BMI of 20 kg/m 2 , and only a modestly elevated risk in South Asians (HR = 1. 21 This is the first large-scale population-based study to show the continuous association between BMI and COVID-19 mortality across different ethnic groups on a population level, and to provide BMI values that show equivalent risk at commonly used thresholds for obesity classifications. Our findings are consistent with previous observations in a community setting at the start of the pandemic and a later in-hospital study 6, 7 , which also observed an interaction between BMI and ethnicity with COVID-19 outcomes. We extend these previous studies by quantifying the shape of the interaction across a continuous measure of BMI using linked Census and health care records up to the end of 2020, which allowed for the adjustment of detailed sociodemographic characteristics and comorbidities in a population-level dataset. Our findings suggest that, unlike other health outcomes such as type 2 diabetes 12-14 , it may not be possible to achieve BMI threshold equivalency in the risk of COVID-19 mortality for class I obesity. Current guidelines suggest that BMI thresholds for obesity classifications should be reduced by 2.5 kg/m 2 in ethnic minority groups 15, 16 . This study suggests that applying these criteria to COVID-19 mortality will only have a marginal impact and still produce thresholds where risk is substantially elevated in ethnic minority groups compared to white ethnicities.",

This is consistent with meta-analyses for allcause mortality which have reported the nadir in risk occurs between a BMI of 25 to 30 kg/m 217,18 . The shape of association in the present study could be explained by the fact that low levels of BMI are associated with malnutrition and higher levels of frailty and sarcopenia 19 , which are in themselves associated with a greater risk of COVID-19 20, 21 . The finding that the association between BMI and COVID-19 mortality was stronger in those under 70 years of age is consistent with previous observations from the United States and Europe and provides further evidence for the importance of BMI as a risk factor in younger populations [5] [6] [7] . It is plausible that weaker associations between Reports the risk of an event relative to white ethnicities at specific BMI values.

BMI and COVID-19 in older individuals may reflect the greater absolute risk of COVID-19 with age and the risk profile in older normal or underweight weight individuals with frailty or other factors 5, 22 . The reasons underpinning the observed ethnicity by obesity interaction are unclear. It has previously been suggested that ethnic minority groups may have a stronger innate inflammatory response to viral infection or chronic disease [23] [24] [25] , thus potentially increasing the risk of severe COVID-19 23 . It is possible that the presence of greater levels of adiposity interacts with and accelerates this inflammatory response in ethnic minority groups 7 . However, unlike previous findings from the start of the pandemic or from hospital settings where the risk with obesity was found to be greatest in Black ethnicities 6,7 , this research using national level data from primary care during the first year of the pandemic suggests that the risk with obesity is greater in all minority ethnic groups compared to white ethnicities, with South Asian ethnicities at greatest risk. This mirrors the interaction between ethnicity and BMI with cardiometabolic disease where risk has also consistently been shown to be greatest in South Asian ethnicities [12] [13] [14] . Further research in this area, including the potential of genetic and epigenetic factors, is warranted.",

            "text": "A major strength is the large population-level dataset linking national Census and health care record data making it the largest analysis of its kind to date. Linkage between clinical records and Census data allowed for the extraction of BMI from primary care records and ethnicity from Census data, which is a major strength as ethnicity is not universally coded within primary care 26 , with a previous study investigating COVID-19 risk factors in England finding ethnicity coding was missing in over 25% of clinical records 10 . We were also able to extract detailed descriptive and covariate data from a wide range of sociodemographic and clinical factors, allowing for the adjustment of potentially confounding variables including household and area indicators of deprivation and established clinical risk factors for COVID-19 mortality. However, there were limitations. Most notably, this analysis is generalisable to the 52.4% of the English population with coded BMI data within their health care records in the 10 years preceding the pandemic. In England, height and weight are collected as part of routine care. Nevertheless, family practice incentivisation schemes and differential take-up rates to population-level vascular screening programmes means that data are not missing at random 27 . Previous analysis has shown that women, those who attend their family doctor more often, who come from more deprived areas, who have a high or low BMI and have a greater number of comorbidities are more likely to have a coded BMI value 27 . Nevertheless, the pattern of overweight and obesity in this study (66.9% for white ethnicities, 77.4% for Black ethnicities, 65.4% for South Asian ethnicities and 59.4% for other ethnic minority groups) were similar to national survey data were the highest rates (consistently above 70%) are reported in Black ethnicities 28 . It has also been demonstrated that complete case analysis excluding missing data within clinical records can provide unbiased estimates of adjusted exposure-outcome associations under a wide range of missing data assumptions 29 , particularly when missingness is independent of the outcome, as was demonstrated for this study. In addition, primary care data in England provide some of the most detailed electronic health care records internationally and are routinely used to identify individuals at risk of chronic and infectious diseases, including COVID-19 mortality 30, 31 , giving this study real-world utility. However, as this is real word administrative data, it is possible not all COVID-19 deaths or hospital admissions were captured, or conversely, some deaths or hospital admissions may have been coded as attributable to COVID-19 in error. It is notable though that a high proportion of COVID-19 deaths (94.0%) were coded as U07.1, therefore relatively few deaths were subject to symptom-based or epidemiological diagnosed cases. Although we report a secondary outcome of hospital admissions as a marker of disease severity, data was not available for in-hospital treatment. This study utilised data from the 2011 Census, therefore any sociodemographic changes within the last decade will not be reflected in the analysis. Although we adjusted for factors related to the risk of SARS-CoV-2 exposure, including household composition, key worker status and exposure to others, it is not possible to verify whether the associations observed with BMI and ethnicity were due to greater disease severity, greater SARS-CoV-2 exposure and infection rates, or a combination of both. Therefore results should be interpreted simply as the populationlevel risk of dying from COVID-19 during the first year of pandemic.",

The proportional hazards assumption was assessed visually using log-log survival plots across quartiles of BMI. The strength of interaction was tested using a likelihood-ratio test. Restricted cubic splines were fitted with 3 knots at the 25th (23.2 kg/m 2 ), 50th (26.3 kg/m 2 ) and 75th (29.8 kg/m 2 ) BMI percentiles. A BMI of 22.5 kg/m 2 (representing a value within the normal range) in white ethnicities as the largest group was specified as the reference to which all other ethnic minority groups and BMI values were compared. Model fit was determined using the concordance statistic (c-index), with values over 0.8 interpreted as a strong model fit. Models were repeated for the outcome of hospital admissions to investigate whether associations of ethnicity and BMI with hospital admissions were consistent with the pattern of associations observed for mortality.",

The interaction between BMI and ethnicity revealed that differences in the risk of COVID-19 mortality in Black, South Asian and other ethnic minority groups compared to white ethnicities varied substantially with BMI (Fig. 1B, with specific values highlighted inTable 2).

The pattern of association between BMI and COVID-19 mortality across ethnic groups produced an equivalent level of risk at substantially different BMI values; for example, the risk of COVID-19 mortality observed in white ethnicities at a BMI of 40 kg/m 2 was equivalent to the risk observed at BMI values of 30.1, 27.0 and 32.2 kg/m 2 in Black, South Asian and other ethnic minority groups.",
