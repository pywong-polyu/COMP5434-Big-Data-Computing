            "text": "In this study, we present the use of an internet of things (IoT) analytics platform service to mimic real-time pipeline monitoring and determine the location of damage on a pipeline. Pressure pulses, based on the principle of vibration in pipes are used for pipeline monitoring in this study. The principle of time delay between pulse arrivals at sensor positions is also adopted in this study. An Arduino and a Wi-Fi module were combined, programmed and used to produce a wireless communication device which communicates with the ThingSpeak internet of things (IoT) analytics platform. A total of five channels were created on the platform to collect data from the five sensors that were used in the experimental test rig that made use of wireless communication device. Signal data was collected once every 15 s and all the channels were updated every 2 min. ThingSpeak provided instant visualizations of data posted by the wireless communication device. Online analysis and processing of the data was performed as it came in. A second test rig was built that made use of a data logger for processing of data. The measured velocity of pulse propagation using the data logger and air as transport fluid was 355 m/s. The computed estimates of event location for the 50 measurements taken ranged between 4.243 m and 4.246 m. This had a scatter of just 3 mm against the actual measured event location of 4.23 m. The experimental results obtained showed that the performance of the wireless communication device compared satisfactorily with the data logger and is capable of detecting the location of damage on real pipelines when used for real time monitoring. Using this communication device and an analytics platform, real-time monitoring of pipelines can be carried out from any location in the world on any internet-enabled device.",

            "text": "Pipelines are considered as the major globally recognised means of transporting petroleum products. These pipelines are usually damaged as a result of natural events (erosion, earthquakes, etc.) or due to third party activities (explosions, drilling activities, vehicular movement, etc.). Methods of monitoring of pipelines include intermittent appraisal of pipelines, use of pipeline integrity management systems, on-the-ground and air surveillance of pipelines by security forces. High cost, planning complexity, and lack of proper access routes are major drawbacks for these monitoring methods. A great challenge that pipeline operators have faced in the past has been that of real-time monitoring of pipelines that is not restricted to control rooms in a particular location. Previous research works on pipeline monitoring have rarely focused on real time transmission and monitoring of damage data wirelessly to an Internet-of-Things (IoT) platform. Previous research works have focused on the design/development of intelligence pipeline inspection gauges (pigs) to achieve this [1] . Available in the world today is about 2.5 million kilometres of hydrocarbon pipeline [2] . That is enough to go around the earth's circumference at least 62 times because the earth has a circumference of about 40,000 km [3] . For different reasons, a good percentage of pipelines across the world are considered impossible to pig. These reasons include:",

            "text": "The process of pigging is a very expensive one. Estimates have shown that pipeline monitoring and inspection by pigs can cost as much as $56,000 per km of pipeline [4] . Taking into consideration that 25 percent of the world's pipelines fall into the 'un-piggable' class, it can be estimated that companies are spending close to $105 billion on pigging the world's hydrocarbon pipelines [4] . This is more than the annual gross domestic product of a lot of countries. Creating a pigging system for pipeline inspection and monitoring is a very messy and labor intensive process. A very demanding planning process is required to make sure that operations are maintained within Health, Safety and Environment (HSE) parameters because most pigging processes run whilst pipelines are in service. Trained crew may require hours to correctly load the pig into the pipe after the planning is complete; and the running distance will only stretch to a handful of kilometers. As a result of this, depending on the pipe, before an inspection pattern can emerge, pigs may need to be launched severally. Smart pigs use high-tech innovation such as transmitters, sensors, GPS, eddy current, magnetic fields, ultrasonic and acoustics to distinguish and analyze potential issues [5] .",

            "text": "Methods of pipeline line monitoring from previous research exists. These methods have their various merits and demerits. The negative pressure wave (NPW) method of pipeline monitoring was used by Junxiao et al. [6] in carrying out damage detection in a gas pipeline. A stress wave generated by leakage in the pipeline, which propagates along the pipeline from the leakage point to both ends was used. Also used was the hoop strain variation along the pipe leakage point to both ends, and the hoop strain variation along the pipe wall. The pipeline monitoring method of wavelet packet-based damage index matrix was developed by Guofeng et al. [7] and was used to identify the crack damage in pipeline structure using a stress wave propagation approach with piezo-ceramic transducers. In the work, four cracks were artificially cut on the specimen, and each crack had six damage cases corresponding to different crack depths. This aided them to simulate cracks at different locations with different damage degrees. In each damage case, they used one piezoceramic transducer as an actuator to generate a stress wave to propagate along the pipeline specimen, and the other piezo-ceramic transducers were used as sensors to detect the wave responses. Golmohamadi [8] used the pipeline monitoring method of wavelet transform for processing signals to recognize damage and leak location in a hardware-based technique which used ultrasonic wave emission. The pipeline monitoring method of vibrothermography was adopted by Changhang et al. [9] . A lowpower piezo-ceramic transducer was used as the actuator of vibrothermography. Its ability to detect multiple surface cracks in a metal part was explored. Also, the Fourier transform signal processing technique was employed in the work and results showed that all cracks can be detected conveniently and simultaneously by using the proposed low-power vibrothermography. Enrique et al. [10] combined the guided waves and electro-mechanical impedance techniques based on smart sensing to define a new and integrated damage detection procedure. This combination of techniques was studied by them and they proposed a new integrated damage indicator based on Electro-Mechanical Power Dissipation (EMPD). They tested the applicability of their proposed technique through different experimental tests, with both lab-scale and realscale structures. A new method of pipeline monitoring was proposed by Kia et al. [11] as damage detection of a concrete column structure, subjected to blast loads using embedded piezo-ceramic smart aggregates (SAs) was investigated. The work proposed an active-sensing based approach in which the embedded SAs act as actuators and sensors that can respectively generate and detect stress waves.",

Due to unwanted interference noise from traffic, water, wind and other sources, the acoustic method of pipeline monitoring was found to be inefficient in the determination of a leak in a pipe [13] . Inaccurate modelling of the transients and boundary conditions in a pipe network was found to be a major drawback of the inverse least square method of pipeline monitoring [14] . The oil and gas sector has been slow to embrace IoT technology despite having pipelines and refining facilities, and instrumentation on drilling rigs for decades. Only recently has the extraction industry begun to work with modern IoT [15] . This change, is in part due to energy prices that have taken a hit in recent times; and most especially due to the coronavirus pandemic. There is an urgent need for oil-producing nations to safeguard their oil pipeline facilities from oil saboteurs in a bid to save their earnings from oil and gas production. This will in no small measure contribute to the funding of their national budget and boost their foreign exchange earnings [16] . Oil companies have been working to cut costs; and integration and automation is one of the easiest places to achieve this. An IoT solution that would be able to tie all these different threads of data together has now become a viable option for petroleum companies seeking to minimize human error and obtain real-time insights from the wide range of instrumentation present on the average petroleum pipeline [15] .",

Located closest to the tee connection was sensor 2, meaning it was closest to the point of arrival of the pulse in the pipe. This is the point where the pulse enters the main pipe and therefore defines the event location. The pulse enters at this point and then sets off in both directions arriving first at sensor 2, followed by sensor 1, then sensor 3, then sensor 4, and finally sensor 5. This result confirmed the principle of delay in time arrivals of pulses at sensors that was adopted in this study. In the work, the arrival of pulses at sensors also varied according to their respective distances from the location of damage (the pulse generator). The sensor closest to the damage location gave the pulse with the highest amplitude and the sensor farthest from the damage location gave the pulse with the least amplitude. The shape and pattern of the pulses in both works were also similar. The best independent possible measurement of the event as it enters the pipe is sensor 2. This is because attenuation or distortion of the pulse propagating from the tee connection will be very little before it reaches sensor 2 as a result of its proximity to the tee connection.

The location of the real event is the point of entrance of the original pressure pulse into the main pipe and it was determined from measurements made at sensors 1 and 2. The tee connection is the actual source of the pulses and formed the basis of all calculations about the location of the event. Equation 2 was used to calculate the actual event location which is the event occurring at sensor 2. The equation was slightly modified because as opposed to Fig. 1 , in the actual experimental test rig, the tee connection was located between sensors 1 and 2, but closest to sensor 2 (the event location). Therefore Eq. 2 was modified as: (the distance of the event location from sensor 1) plus the known distance between sensor 2 and the tee connection (x offset ) gave the location of the event. x 21 is the known distance between sensor 1 and 2, while t 12 is the measured time delay between pulse arrivals at sensors 1 and 2 which was obtained using the cross-correlation technique. With the aid of the written Matlab\u00ae code, a consistency in the computed event location estimates was observed. The computed estimates were in the range of between 4.243 and 4.246 m, and having a scatter of just 3 mm. The actual measured location of the event on the test rig was 4.23 m.",

Based on a previously developed method of locating the position of an intrusion event on a pipe that relies on the time delay between pulse arrivals at two sensors, a difference of 20 mm only was recorded between the computed and actual event locations when a data logger was used for capturing and transmission of sensor data. This was carried out as a way of validating the theory of pipeline monitoring based on pulse arrival times at sensors along the pipe. The wireless communication device was then used for capturing and transmission of data from sensors on the test rig's pipe to the Thing-Speak platform.
