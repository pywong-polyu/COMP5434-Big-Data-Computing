In this special COVID-19 pandemic environment, traditional way of healthcare through face-to-face contact so called analogue healthcare system might have a lot of problems. It increases a chances of COVID-19 infection during clinic and hospital visit for only simple consultation or prescription refills and could not cover the patient's and physician's needs. Modern digital healthcare system can provide patients, family members, and healthcare professionals with support during COVID-19 pandemic [4] . Psychological symptoms associated with the pandemic include anxiety-driven panic buying, paranoia about going to community events and fears coming from isolation. These describe how the pandemic can affect people's mental health and how digital healthcare system can decrease patients' COVID-19 related issues without increasing risk of infection of the coronavirus.",

However, this pilot project only focuses on monitoring the patient's blood pressure and glucose and then discussing patient's problems by telephone call, SNS, or e-mail. Although there are already advanced digital technologies for monitoring patient's blood pressure, glucose level, pulse, temperature, activity tracking, oxygen saturation, and so on, those technologies appropriately in real clinical practice settings could not be adopted because of the various conservative regulations in the medical field, unreasonable compensation plan for the physi- cians, absence of clear regulations of legal responsibilities for the physician's recommendations and unclear national blueprint for the digital healthcare in future. However, all the current situations clearly show that immediate changes of analogue healthcare systems into digital systems will help overcome the COVID-19 and other pandemic crises with perspectives to build up best healthcare systems for patients.",
