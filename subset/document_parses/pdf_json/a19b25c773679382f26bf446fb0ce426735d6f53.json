Tweets and hashtags allow users to engage in discourse around certain topics and find common areas of interest. Twitter can be used to disseminate important scientific knowledge [4, 5] and reach a wide audience, especially those who are unable to attend in person or are present but at a different session [3] . Researchers have performed analyses to identify what constitutes a successful tweet and have examined factors associated with likelihood of a retweet (ie, presence of media or a hyperlink), a marker of impact and dissemination [2, 3] . Furthermore, in 2019, novel medical education tools within Infectious Diseases such as ID Journal Club (@IDJClub) have been implemented on the Twitter platform [6] . With the transition of IDWeek 2020 (October 21 to October 25, 2020) to a completely virtual event due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, we sought to evaluate engagement of users, social networks, and topics discussed on Twitter to understand the characteristics of this new conference forum. We hypothesize that these data could be valuable to the IDWeek planning committee and may aid Twitter users, new or old, in determining accounts or users of interest.",

When compared with IDWeek 2016 (3249 tweets from 488 users) [2] , there was nearly a 4-fold increase in tweet activity and 7-fold increase in users. This large uptick may be a result of expected growth on the Twitter platform or the virtual format of the conference, which lent itself to increased internet access and impetus for virtual connection. With over half of all tweets representing retweets, there was clear evidence of amplification of original messages, facilitating sharing of ideas and thoughts. This permits engagement in conversation and is one of the most attractive reasons for using this medium. While social networks cannot replicate in-person networks [10] , significant activity is noted around certain users, exemplified by both network analyses. Weighted lines demonstrate that even 1 individual or user account has the potential to initiate dialogue while many others participate. Interestingly, an account unrelated specifically to Infectious Diseases emerged at the center of the largest cluster (@nynursesunited) in our analysis, demonstrating the reach and impact of the social network.",

However, other important topics were discussed, including the need to address health policy and disparities within Infectious Diseases, antibiotic stewardship, and clinical pearls. We believe the IDWeek organizers can use these data as a measure of success by understanding which topics or sessions were most commonly discussed. Similarly, if there were certain sessions they wished emphasized or highlighted through the program but these were not significantly discussed on Twitter, they could use this as an opportunity to promote these future sessions on Twitter to garner more interest.",

Similarly, we extracted tweets only in the English language, and this study does not help inform topics or networks where the discussion was in another language.

However, Twitter can be useful when trying to keep abreast of the rapidly changing landscape of medical literature, and we believe the information gained from our analyses can help a general Twitter user identify accounts of interest and uncover valuable information for IDWeek organizers as they plan future conferences. Despite the loss of the personal and humanistic feel to previous IDWeeks, social networks allowed individuals to engage in a network far beyond their in-person ones. Given the increasing Twitter activity at medical conferences, we expect Twitter to continue to play a significant role in engaging the Infectious Diseases community in the future.",
