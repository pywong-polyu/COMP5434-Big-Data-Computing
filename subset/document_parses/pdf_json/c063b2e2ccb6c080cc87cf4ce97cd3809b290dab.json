There are limited studies in children with respiratory comorbidities, apart from asthma, presumably due to low morbidity of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the general paediatric population along with the low incidence of certain pulmonary conditions. [1] [2] [3] Remdesivir, a broad spectrum antiviral agent against several RNA viruses, has been shown to reduce time to clinical improvement in adults and has been retrospectively studied in small pediatric cohorts with promising results. In anticipation of randomized controlled trials for the pediatric population, an expert consensus suggests the use of antivirals in children on a case-by-case basis. 2, 3 We present a case of COVID-19 infection in a 3-year old toddler with severe postinfectious bronchiolitis obliterans (PIBO), who received compassionate treatment with 5-day-course of remdesivir, and recovered with favourable outcome.",

Little evidence exists, more than one year after the onset of SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, whether pediatric patients with chronic lung disease may benefit from antiviral or immunomodulatory treatment. According to Chiotos et al. 4 there is insufficient evidence F I G U R E 1 (A, B) Patient's baseline chest CT findings. (C) Chest X-ray at presentation. (D) Three-month follow-up chest X-ray post COVID-19 admission [Color figure can be viewed at wileyonlinelibrary.com]demonstrating that such patients are at higher risk for severe COVID-19. However, the panel suggests the use of antivirals with a preference for remdesivir in patients with significant pulmonary disease, as they may be more likely to experience severe illness.In a European multicentre cohort study from the PTBNET, remdesivir was used in 3% of 582 patients and 4% received systemic corticosteroids; the majority had underlying medical conditions including chronic pulmonary disease. Nevertheless, the low numbers of treated patients prevented investigators from drawing firm conclusions regarding effectiveness.2 A retrospective multicentre study from Spain describes eight patients treated with remdesivir (four previously healthy, four with complex medical conditions) with 87.5% survival rate and nonsignificant adverse events. Interestingly, they report a 15year-old patient diagnosed with bronchiolitis obliterans post HSCT for CTLA-4 haplo-insufficiency on corticosteroids treatment and intermittent home oxygen support. Their COVID-19 admission was uneventful; they did not require invasive mechanical ventilation, received remdesivir along with hydroxychloroquine and were discharged home after 11 days of hospitalization.In our case, we treated our patient with systemic steroids, mostly due to his underlying refractory lung disease rather than for severe COVID-19 with striking inflammation. Chrousos and Meduri have suggested the occurence of CIRCI (Critical Illness-related Corticosteroid Insufficiency) phenomenon which translates to the relative inability of endogenous cortisol to control the profound inflammation and the significance of early onset of therapy with glucocorticoids before the homeostatic mechanisms reach irreversible exhaustion.5",
