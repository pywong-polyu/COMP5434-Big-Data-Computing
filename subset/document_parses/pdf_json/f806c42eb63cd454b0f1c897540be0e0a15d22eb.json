The purpose of this study was to determine the costs and benefits of maintaining or expanding a staffed ICU bed reserve capacity in Germany. Methods This study compared the provision of additional capacity to no intervention from a societal perspective. A decision model was developed using, e.g. information on age-specific fatality rates, ICU costs and outcomes, and the herd protection threshold. The net monetary benefit (NMB) was calculated based upon the willingness to pay for new medicines for the treatment of cancer, a condition with a similar disease burden in the near term. Results The marginal cost-effectiveness ratio (MCER) of the last bed added to the existing ICU capacity is \u20ac21,958 per life-year gained assuming full bed utilization. The NMB decreases with an additional expansion but remains positive for utilization rates as low as 2%. In a sensitivity analysis, the variables with the highest impact on the MCER were the mortality rates in the ICU and after discharge. Conclusions This article demonstrates the applicability of cost-effectiveness analysis to policies of hospital pandemic preparedness and response capacity strengthening. In Germany, the provision of a staffed ICU bed reserve capacity appears to be cost-effective even for a low probability of bed utilization.",

This strategy includes a bundle of measures such as a partial shutdown of businesses, social distancing, tracking, testing, public mask wearing, and quarantine orders [1] . An important goal of this strategy is to control COVID-19 outbreaks or postpone them ('flatten the curve') and thus avoid overstretching intensive care unit (ICU) capacity at the time of peak demand (cf. [2] ). Given the high number of transmissions in the German population at the time of writing this manuscript (14,054 new COVID-19 cases and 4257 ICU cases on December 8, 2020) [3] , the German federal government and the German federal states have extended (on November 25, 2020) the additional measures, which have been in force since November, until January 10, 2021 [4] . There is hope that these measures will also reduce the incidence of infections with the influenza virus, which shows similar routes of transmission. This would avoid a double burden on hospital capacities in the forthcoming months [5] .",

Primary prevention aims to reduce the incidence of COVID-19. Secondary prevention screens for infected asymptomatic and symptomatic patients with COVID-19. At the same time, secondary prevention of infected individuals is primary prevention of potential contacts. Tertiary prevention aims to prevent sequelae of COVID-19. While the COVID-19 mitigation strategy currently pursued by the German government emphasizes primary and secondary prevention, adding ICU bed capacity is an example of tertiary prevention. The German government had pursued the latter strategy, with approximately 7000 beds added as of April 27, 2020 [11] , but thereafter recommended to redeploy part of the available hospital capacity for treating non-COVID-19 patients [8] . An alternative tertiary prevention strategy that is still under investigation is medical treatment of COVID-19. Currently, there is great hope for future COVID-19 treatments by repurposing drugs that are already approved for other diseases and demonstrate acceptable safety profiles (cf. [12] ).",

The ICU bed capacity includes potential ICU beds ('surge beds') that could be supported by current staff in the event of a surge. Surge capacity is a broader term that encompasses not only potential beds but also \"available space in which patients may be triaged, managed, vaccinated, decontaminated, or simply located; available personnel of all types; necessary medications, supplies and equipment; and even the legal capacity to deliver healthcare under situations which exceed authorized capacity\" [14] .

The latter model determines the loss of life years when no ICU bed capacity is left to treat COVID-19 patients. It is based on a life-table model that summarizes the age-specific mortality impact of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. To account for the age distribution of the population, the model weighs age-specific lifeexpectancy changes by age-specific population sizes. This paper extends the previous model based on the following conceptual idea: the clinical value of an additional ICU bed is equivalent to the marginal loss of life years in the absence of an additional ICU bed, i.e. when the demand for ICU beds exceeds the available capacity by one ICU bed. Following this principle, I calculated the weighted-average loss of life years when the demand exceeds the available ICU bed capacity by one bed, with weights reflecting the portions of patients (1) admitted to the ICU and (2) refused admission. These weights were multiplied by the average per-capita loss of life years in the German population (compared with noncrisis mortality rates) when all patients with ICU indications were admitted to the ICU and refused admission.

However, during the coronavirus crisis, government funds covered a portion of the capital costs resulting from the expansion of ICU capacity, i.e. \u20ac50,000 per additional ICU bed [19] . Hence, the WACC for private hospitals needs to be adjusted for this portion (cf. [20] ). In contrast, when public hospitals expand their capacity, they receive interestfree loans from the federal states without any obligation to pay them back. Nevertheless, only half of the infrastructure investments are currently covered by the federal states [21] . The overall opportunity cost of capital was thus calculated as a weighted average of the WACC and a zero cost of capital, with the weights representing shares of private and public funding, respectively.",

I multiplied the cumulative probability of surviving until age j by health expenditures at age j , took the sum over all ages j , and thus obtained the remaining health expenditures for an individual at age i . By comparing the remaining health expenditures for different levels of ICU bed capacity, I calculated the life-extension costs.

A strategy of supplying additional ICU beds becomes cost effective once there is a 2% probability that the virus mitigation strategy is not successful or is abandoned because it is too expensive or burdensome for society or because a vaccine is not distributed in time. Hence, an economic justification for a bed expansion strategy requires a positive probability of viral spread in the population, potentially leading to herd immunity by natural infection, regardless of whether this is actively sought by the government. Although an overload of the intensive care bed capacity may still seem unlikely at the time of writing this manuscript (December 8, 2020), mean values are less relevant than extreme values in disaster control. Instead, the so-called fat tail risk, that is, a non-negligible probability that a catastrophe will occur, is an important consideration. Indeed, such a thick end of the distribution has been observed in \"major epidemic and pandemic diseases of history\" [49] .",

However, even before the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic the healthcare environment in Germany has been characterized by labor shortages, particularly ICU nurses [52] . In 2018, the German government initiated steps to improve short-and long-term nursing staff numbers [53] . In general, short-term strategies to address a shortage of labor in the ICU include accelerated training for ICU nurses; contacting former nurses with ICU experience and other recently retired staff; and redeploying anesthesiologists, other physicians, other nurses, respiratory therapists, other allied health professionals and other staff with appropriate skills to work in a critical-care environment [50, 54, 55] . In fact, during the first pandemic wave in Germany, former nurses responded to COVID-19 calls to return to service. Assuming that altruistic motives played a major role, attractive sign-on bonuses may enable recruitment of an additional cohort of former nurses with stronger financial motives. What this study shows is that sign-on bonuses for former nurses can be quite high given the large societal NMB of a filled ICU bed. Based on the model, a sign-on bonus of, say, \u20ac20,000 per ICU nurse or equivalent staff member, plus the cost of a refresher course, would lead to a negligible increase in the required probability of full utilization.",

If ICU labor and bed capacity is expanded, say, by cancelling or postponing unrelated treatments (e.g. elective surgeries), this would increase the minimum acceptable bed utilization rate. Therefore, a strategy of supplying additional ICU beds requires careful planning. Recently, dexamethasone was shown to lower the 28-day mortality among hospitalized COVID-19 patients receiving respiratory support [56] . Expanding ICU bed capacity and life-prolonging treatments of COVID-19 become complementary interventions if life-prolonging treatments have a label for ICU patients. In that case, ICU bed expansion becomes an enabling strategy for life-prolonging treatments and creates option value (cf. [57] ). Both interventions applied together, thus form a combination therapy. This is also confirmed in the sensitivity analysis of this paper, implying an improved cost effectiveness of ICU bed expansion when accounting for a lower ICU mortality. Of note, the absolute mortality reduction demonstrated by dexamethasone (12%) is already achieved by an ICU capacity expansion of 3500 beds (assuming full capacity utilization), thus emphasizing the clinical significance of ICU bed expansion.",

Some of these reasons were already captured in the sensitivity analysis and include high mortality in the ICU and post-discharge. As shown, a high CFR in the ICU even leads to a negative NMB. One reason for a higher CFR in the ICU exists when rationing decisions in the absence of an ICU bed disfavor patients with less prospect of survival. Thus, patients who are not admitted to the ICU are likely to be older and at higher risk. Furthermore, this study did not include direct nonmedical costs, such as time and transportation costs, which are mandated by the societal perspective adopted in this paper. Moreover, given the funding challenges of the coronavirus crisis for the German healthcare system, stepping up surge capacity may create increasing opportunity costs. The latter would be accounted for by a decreasing willingness to pay for an additional life year. Nevertheless, as in this analysis, MCERs are far below the willingness to pay threshold over a large increment of beds, a diminishing willingness to pay would only matter for extreme expansions.",

First, by including future medical costs along with the costs of hospitalizations in the first year after ICU discharge, some double counting of hospitalization costs may result. Furthermore, the DRG rates may not reflect true hospital costs and may yield a positive profit margin for ventilated patients [58] . Moreover, the productivity gains resulting from a reduction in mortality were not included due to the age distribution of averted deaths (the median age is 82 years) and the difficulty of disentangling deaths in relevant age groups (e.g. in the age group 50-69 years). Finally, an additional reserve capacity may also prevent deaths from other infectious disease outbreaks and public health emergencies.

QALYs diminish the health benefits obtained from additional survival by accounting for a quality-of-life decrement of ICU survivors. As the QALY metric thus discriminates against the elderly and the disabled, it has been considered ethically controversial [59] . There also exists a methodological concern with regard to QALYs when the quality of life of ICU survivors is reduced to a degree that they do not want to go on living. This so-called maximum endurable time invalidates the QALY metric [60] (as a word of caution, the presence of a maximum endurable time would also question the appropriateness of using life-years gained or even lives saved as measures of health benefit but rather for ethical than for methodological reasons). For these reasons, QALYs have not been used so far in Germany for the purpose of reimbursing and pricing new, innovative medicines (cf. [61] ). As another counterpoint, the public debate on COVID-19 in Germany has mainly focused on mortality as an endpoint and the number of life-years lost by the elderly who die from COVID-19. In summary, there is not a straightforward answer to the question of which outcome measure best reflects the value of expanded ICU capacity. Life-years gained may serve as a compromise between the use of unweighted lives saved and QALYs gained.",
