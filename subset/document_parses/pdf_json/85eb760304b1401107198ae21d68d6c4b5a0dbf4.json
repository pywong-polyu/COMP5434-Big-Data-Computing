Our design goals were that the representation framework depict mechanism components across stages of biological organization; display perturbation propagation; make use of standard biomedical ontology terms wherever possible to name the components; provide an intuitive way to visualize ignorance, uncertainties, and ambiguities; and allow tight linkage to evidence in the literature and databases. The MecCog mechanism representation framework (Darden et al., 2018) incorporates all these features. The representation formalism is based on the analysis of biological mechanisms developed in the philosophy of biology (Craver and Darden, 2013) : Mechanisms are characterized as entities and activities organized such that they are productive of regular changes from start or set-up to finish or termination conditions. In MecCog, a mechanism by which a genetic variant causes a disease phenotype is represented as a mechanism schema that displays the propagation of entity and activity perturbations across biological organizational stages (DNA\u00e0RNA\u00e0Protein\u00e0Complex\u00e0Organelle\u00e0Cell\u00e0Tissue\u00e0Organ\u00e0Phenotype) in the form of a graph (nodes are biological entities; directed edges are causal and labeled with productive activities) constructed from information in the biomedical literature in addition to established biological concepts.",

The schema building tool in MecCog is supported by specially designed graphical notations, curated ontology-informed terminology for the annotation of mechanism components (entities and activities), an interactive graphical user interface (GUI) to construct the schema drawings, application programming interfaces (APIs) to fetch reference information and scientific figures, tight integration and hyperlinking of evidence to the graphics, and a secure server to save schemas as JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) objects. The platform supports edit, version, and share operations on each schema to facilitate collaborative work. Mature schemas can be published on the platform, thereby adding to the collection of disease mechanisms available for browsing by MecCog web-site visitors. Sketchier schemas with gaps, ambiguities, and uncertainties can also be published to indicate where additional work needs to be directed.",

Each step consists of a triplet with an input substate perturbation, a mechanism module, and an output substate perturbation (SSP-MM-SSP). A substate perturbation represents a perturbed biological entity (e.g. a DNA base change, altered stability of a protein, altered abundance of a molecular complex, altered state of a cell). A mechanism module represents the productive activity (e.g. transcription, translation, or protein-protein interaction) by which the input sub-state perturbation produces the output sub-state perturbation. The succession of overlapping SSP-MM-SSP triplets represents perturbation propagation across stages of biological organization (DNA, RNA, Protein, Complex, Organelle, Cell, Tissue, Organ, and Phenotype), and together form a mechanism schema. In MecCog, a schema is represented as a graph where the nodes are SSPs and edge labels are MMs, as illustrated in Figure 1 . Each SSP represents a perturbed biological entity and each MM represents a productive activity (or a group of entities and activities) that produce an output SSP.",

Authors also provide a schema description with scientific background information. Table 1B shows the mechanism component annotations. All mechanism components in a schema are annotated with a unique component identifier. Nine stage names may be assigned to an SSP component notation -DNA, RNA, Protein, Complex, Organelle, Cell, Tissue, Organ, and Phenotype. For the molecular stages (DNA, RNA Protein, and Complex), a set of stage-specific SSP perturbation class names, such as SNV, mRNA abundance, or protein stability, have been compiled. Molecular stage MM classes, such as transcription, translation, and protein folding, are also defined (Table 2) . Whenever possible the SSP and MM class names are curated from existing biomedical ontologies. Currently used ontologies are listed in Table 2 . Where required, ontology terms may be prefixed with a modifierincreased, decreased, or altered. A MecCog schema builder may choose from the curated set of classes for a step, or may add new class names if needed. SSP and MM instance names are in free text. We are in the process of developing a disease mechanism ontology, based on the class names. Such an ontology is potentially useful for automatic text mining of SSP, MM, and triplet information from the literature, so speeding schema building by identifying relevant papers and sections of papers.

A novel feature of this page is the display of references and hyper-linked PubMed IDs providing evidence for each aspect of the schema as well as PMC images selected to illustrate aspects of the mechanism. The Schema Visualizer button on the landing page directs a user to the GUI for interactively navigating the mechanism schema (as shown in Figure 5B ). The visualizer inherits all the interactive features of the schema builder GUI (described previously). A unique feature of the visualizer is the tight integration of the graphical notations for the mechanism components and the associated evidence information (presented in the pop-up box). The pop-up box (yellow-colored box in Figure 5B ) displays hyperlinked ontology sources for the SSP/MM class name (if the term is from an ontology), a brief builder-provided commentary on the evidence, and hyperlinked PMIDs and PMC figure IDs. There is a help icon ('?') in the visualizer to display the mechanism schema key. Clicking on the Comment button in the visualizer opens a modal box to view or enter comments about the schema. The Schema Report button on the landing page generates a narrative report in which the meta-information, mechanism components, and evidence annotations about the schema are presented in a structured format. The schema content can be A B Figure 5 . NOD2 mechanism schema entry in MecCog. This schema describes the known mechanisms by which a frameshift mutation (rs2066847) in the NOD2 gene causes an increased risk for Crohn's disease. Figure 5A shows part of the landing page of the NOD2 schema, displaying the metainformation in tabular format. This page includes the collection of thumbnails of PMC figures selected to illustrate aspects of the mechanism and the list of references with PubMed IDs from which evidence was derived (the list is truncated here -there are 26 references). Figure 5B shows the schema visualizer GUI used for interactive navigation of the schema. For this schema, four possible submechanisms with varying levels of evidence (indicated by the confidence colors -red=low, orange=medium, and green=high) are included. The example yellow pop-up box displays hyperlinked evidence for the associated MM. The comment button on the top can be used to open a modal box, allowing a user to view and add comments.

Figure 5 shows two pages of a MecCog mechanism schema (http://www.meccog.org/mchain/showpubchain?accession=MS031100031.9) describing the mechanism by which a frameshift mutation (rs2066847; NM_022162.3:c.3019dup (p.Leu1007fs)) in the NOD2 gene causes an increased risk of Crohn's disease (CD). NOD2 is the first gene for which variants were found to be associated with altered CD risk (Ogura et al., 2001; Hugot et al., 2001; Yamamoto and Ma, 2009) and the 1007fs mutation is most consistently associated with CD across multiple studies and population groups (Economou et al., 2004) with a very high relative risk of 17.6 for its homozygous genotype status as compared with wild-type controls (Ogura et al., 2001) . Figure 5A shows the landing page displaying the meta-information of the schema and the list of references used as evidence in the schema, together with figures used to illustrate aspects of the mechanism. Figure 5B shows the view of the NOD2 1007fs schema in the interactive visualizer. This schema was constructed using information about mechanism reported in 26 research articles. The left-most SSP (SSP1) represents the DNA stage perturbation (i.e. the single base insertion of cytosine -rs2066847 in the NOD2 gene). The paths in the schema show how the effect of this perturbation propagates through the RNA, protein, complex, and cell stages (represented by the stage-specific SSPs and MMs) so causing the increased Crohn's disease risk phenotype (SSP12). At the RNA stage (SSP2), the rs2066847 variant causes the insertion of a cytosine after the first nucleotide of codon 1007, so introducing a premature downstream stop codon. This leads to the protein stage perturbation, a truncated NOD2 protein (SSP3) missing the last 33 amino acids of the wild-type sequence (L\u00e9cine et al., 2007) . Following this, the schema branches represent the multiple submechanisms by which the truncated NOD2 protein may lead to the increased Crohn's disease risk phenotype by altering the activation of the immune response (MM10) (Negroni et al., 2018; Strober and Watanabe, 2011; Park et al., 2007) . All the branches are labeled 'AND/OR' since none has fully compelling supporting evidence. The submechanism of each branch is outlined below.",

This path is sparse and labeled medium confidence (orange) because the mechanism of interaction between NOD2 and TLRs is not known, nor is it clear how that interaction normally results in increased production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (Underhill, 2007) . Different models have been proposed to describe the mechanism: synergistic production of TNF-\u03b1 by NOD2 and TLR4 (Wolfert et al., 2002) ; activation of the inflammasome by NOD2 via RICK to produce IL-1\u03b2 from pro-IL-1\u03b2 generated as the result of TLR signaling (Sarkar et al., 2006) ; and MDP (the primary agonist for NOD2 (Grimes et al., 2012) ) dose-dependent TNF-\u03b1 production by NOD2 and TLR2 (Borm et al., 2008) . Further, for none of these possibilities has the effect of the NOD2 100fs variant been investigated. These details are provided in the pop-up box for MM3.",

            "text": "C) The lower branch of the schema provides examples of the representation of a gap in knowledge and of overall low confidence. Commensal bacteria are largely prevented from penetrating the gut wall by an outer mucosal barrier and the epithelial cell layer. Paneth cells situated in the gut epithelial layer produce a range of antibiotic defensin peptides to aid in preventing commensal bacteria from traversing the mucosal layer. Some data suggest that this process is partly dependent on MDP binding to NOD2 in these cells, likely signaling that significant numbers of bacteria are getting through to the epithelial cell layer, and so triggering an increased response. Data supporting that view come from an experiment showing stimulation of NOD2 by MDP binding induces production of defensin HNP-1 (human neutrophil peptide 1) in Caco-2 cells (Yamamoto-Furusho et al., 2010) . It has also been shown that the NOD2 1007fs protein fails to induce the production of defensin hBD2 (human \u03b2-defensin-2) in several epithelial cell lines (Voss et al., 2006) . Hence the link between the presence of the 1007fs variant (SSP3) and increased defensin production (currently SSP10). But the mechanism by which MDP binding to NOD2 normally causes defensin production is unknown, hence the black oval (MM11) linking those two SSPs. There is also evidence from other studies that do not support the mechanism represented by this schema path: In two out of four CD cohort studies (Wehkamp et al., 2005; Simms et al., 2008; Hayashi et al., 2016) , and in NOD2 deficient mouse organoids (Wilson et al., 2015) , the association between NOD2 and defensin was not reproduced. Hence this branch is labeled low confidence (red).",

            "text": "Further along this schema branch, the decrease in defensin production (SSP10) leads to an increased abundance of bacteria in the mucosal layer (SSP11) due to decreased bactericidal activity (MM8). In turn, this contributes to increased bacterial abundance in the lamina propria due to increased bacterial influx from the mucosal layer (MM9) and finally leads to the altered activation of the immune response (MM10). Figure 6A shows an example of the use of the biomarker symbol, in part of the Lynch syndrome schema (http://www.meccog.org/mchain/showpubchain?accession=MS020700047.3). In this schema, microsatellite instability is a diagnostic biomarker (Vilar et al., 2014) for Lynch syndrome, resulting from defective base mismatch repair machinery, in turn a consequence of a mutation (rs63750245: C>T) in the MSH2 gene. Figure 6B shows an example of a putative therapeutic intervention site in a Crohn's disease schema (http://www.meccog.org/mchain/showpubchain?accession=MS020500019.2) describing the mechanism by which a missense variant (rs3197999: G>A; R703C) in the MST1 gene (coding for Macrophage Stimulating Protein, MSP) increases disease risk. The missense variant causes a lower abundance of the MSP-RON protein complex by one or both of two mechanisms: a weakened proteinprotein interaction (Chao et al., 2014; Gorlatova et al., 2011) and reduced MSP abundance. Lower abundance of the complex is expected to result in reduced intracellular signaling affecting macrophage activation (Wang et al., 2002; L. Kretschmann et al., 2010; H\u00e4user et al., 2012) and/or epithelial cell survival and growth (Danilkovitch et al., 2000; Neurath, 2014 ). An appropriate compound that bridges the structural interface between MSP and RON could restore wild-type abundance of the complex and hence signaling strength and so eliminate the downstream consequences. (Of course, many factors affect whether this is in fact an effective therapeutic strategy.) Figure 7A shows part of a Lynch syndrome schema (http://www.meccog.org/mchain/showpubchain?accession=MS020700047.3) where the presence of a nonsense mutation (rs63750245: C>T) in the MSH2 gene causes Microsatellite instability (MSI), a known biomarker (symbolized by the red location icon on the SSP) for the Lynch syndrome. Figure 7B shows part of a Crohn's disease schema (http://www.meccog.org/mchain/showpubchain?accession=MS020500019.2) where the decreased abundance of the MSP-RON protein complex (SSP3) is a hypothetical therapeutic intervention site, indicated by the blue octagon. In this case, an appropriate small molecule binding across the proteinprotein interface might restore the wild-type abundance.",

Further, contributions from variants may not be independent, as reflected by evidence of epistatic effects between pairs of variants for complex trait disease (Lin et al., 2017; Li et al., 2020) . The MecCog formalism also supports mechanism schemas with multiple input genetic perturbations. Interactions between these inputs results in a mechanism graph. An example for Crohn's disease is a barrier integrity mechanism graph constructed by combining schemas on loci relevant to bacterial penetration of the gut-lining mucosal layer ( Figure S1 ). This graph incorporates a number of non-additive interactions between mucin gene variants affecting mucosal-layer integrity (MUC1, MUC2), variants affecting the unfolded protein response (XBP1, ORMDL3), and variants affecting autophagy (NOD2, ATG16L1, LRRK2, IRGM).",

These activities are labor-intensive and work best when the schema builder is an expert on the schema subject. To achieve scale for the resource, we require an expertcrowdsourcing strategy, soliciting inputs from appropriate domain experts. The resource is structured so that experts can build schemas based on their knowledge and can also edit and comment on existing schemas. The current version of the MecCog platform supports these activities in the following ways: i) acknowledging contributors to a schema as authors and curators, ii) providing a schema specific commenting interface to solicit input, and iii) allowing versioning of schemas to update content. To implement the crowdsourcing model, we will work closely work with disease-specific research communities (such as IBD Genetics, Crohn's & Colitis Foundation, and Alzforum).",

Because of a KG's ability to integrate and represent multi-relational databases, many biological KGs (Sosa et al., 2019; Celebi et al., 2019; Chen et al., 2019; Himmelstein et al., 2017; PDBe-KB consortium, 2020;  https://digitalinsights.qiagen.com/coronavirus-network-explorer/) are being generated, using a combination of manual and automated mining of subject-predicate-object (SPO) triplets from biomedical literature and from bioinformatics relational databases. The elemental SSP-MM-SSP units of a MecCog schema are a subset of SPO triplets and so it is in principle possible to construct a schema by extracting appropriate triplets from a comprehensive knowledge graph. However, preliminary tests of this process suggest that current knowledge graphs do not capture a large fraction of the triplets incorporated in the corresponding mechanism schemas. There are multiple reasons for this, including the absence of biological knowledge in knowledge graphs and the absence of causal reasoning components.",
