A multivariate analysis determined age \u226560 years to be a predictor of new-onset arrhythmia (OR = 7.36, 95% CI [1.95;27.76], p = .003). D-dimer levels positively correlated with cardiac and new-onset arrhythmic event. New onset atrial arrhythmias predicted in-hospital mortality (OR = 2.99 95% CI [1.35;6.63], p = .007), a longer intensive care unit length of stay (mean of 6.14 days, 95% CI [2.51;9.77], p = .001) and mechanical ventilation duration(mean of 9.08 days, 95% CI [3.75;14.40], p = .001).",

Our finding confirm previously published data from both Bhatla et al. 9 and Colon et al., 10 as both studies found age to be associated with the incidence of cardiac arrhythmia. In the University of Pennsylvania study, 9 after multivariate adjustment, only age (OR 1.05) and heart failure (OR 5.61) were independently associated with incident AF. We also confirmed the lack of association with sex, race, BMI, diabetes, and hypertension. 9 Moreover, in our cohort, the presence of previous cardiac disease was not predictive of new-onset arrhythmia, which highlights the role of the virus and its accompanying high inflammatory burden in inducing cardiac electrical remodeling regardless of previous underlying disease.",

Moreover, complete laboratory testing was not performed in all patients. Additionally, a history of cardiac arrhythmia was based on a review of electronic health records, thus previous AF episodes in patients with new-onset AF during hospitalization cannot be definitely ruled out. Finally, the analysis was based on data from electronic medical records, which is subject to entry errors and missing data.

The association between D-dimer levels and COVID-19 related outcomes has been consistent in most studies. Increasing D-dimer values have been shown to be predictive of in-hospital mortality. 15-17 While Colon et al. 10 showed higher D-dimer levels in patients who developed arrhythmia, we went further to prove D-dimer level as a predictor of new-onset arrhythmias in a multivariate analysis. D-dimer levels can reflect the severity of the body's response to COVID-19. 16 The high inflammatory state associated with COVID-19 can lead to endothelial injury and to the activation of homeostatic activity, 18 demonstrated by an increase in D-dimer levels. Indeed, D-dimer in COVID-are more likely related to the systemic reaction induced by the infection rather than a direct viral injury. Evaluating D-dimer on admission may help select patients in need of close cardiac rhythm monitoring to prompt earlier intervention and possibly lead to better outcomes.",

D-dimer level as a marker of COVID-19 severity was predictive of new-onset atrial arrhythmias, reinforcing the concept that arrhythmias are more likely the result of the systemic inflammatory reaction than a direct viral injury to the heart. The fact that new-onset atrial arrhythmia was a predictor of mortality in COVID-19 hospitalized patients emphasizes the importance of inpatient cardiac rhythm monitoring for further risk stratification. Long-term follow-up of COVID-19 patients would be necessary to determine the occurrence or persistence of new-onset arrhythmia beyond hospitalization and after resolution of the infection.",

Additionally, patients with a history of chronic cardiac disease have almost five times the risk of developing a cardiac complication during their COVID-19 hospitalization compared to patients without a history of cardiac disease (OR = 4.91, 95% CI [2.35;10.26], p < .001).

Price-Haywood et al. showed that the black race was associated with 1.96 times the odds of hospital admission compared to the white race.20 Indeed, 67% of hospitalized patients in our cohort were Black, similar to the percentage reported in the Ochsner study (76.9%). Our registry with 310 total patients in an urban hospital heavily resembled the demographics of the Ochsner study in Louisiana, which featured hospitalized patients that were older (60-70) with a large proportion of Black patients (65% to 75%). In both cases, this rate remains disproportionate given that Black individuals make up 32% of the population of Louisiana. Similarly in the Price-Haywood et al. paper, 20 Black patients had more diabetes and obesity compared to hospitalized White patients. Additionally, Black patients had higher CRP levels at presentation. The higher CRP levels at baseline seen in this population has been observed in previous studies 21,22 and may reflect the underlying chronic inflammatory state associated with a higher comorbidity burden. This observation can partially explain the higher hospitalization rates seen among the Black community, as the underlying chronic inflammation can exacerbate COVID-19 infectious symptoms. Despite this difference in baseline characteristics, Black patients did not demonstrate worse outcomes compared to White patients, confirming the findings by the Ochsner group and others. 1In addition, we showed that Black patients were not at higher risk of developing cardiovascular complications and new-onset arrhythmias during hospitalization. Of note, cross-sectional and observational studies have reported lower prevalence and incidence of AF in Black populations, but with a paradoxically higher adverse risk profile and higher risk of stroke.23 There are no clear evidence as to why this population has less risk of arrhythmia development. We can speculate that while both white and black individuals can develop arrhythmogenic atrial remodeling, the white individual is more susceptible to developing arrhythmias in the setting of the same abnormal tissue substrate. More investigations on the pathophysiology of AF across different demographic and disease profiles would provide insights into this dilemma.",
