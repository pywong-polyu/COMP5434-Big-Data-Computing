We combine a microsimulation model with novel labour market transition techniques to simulate the COVID-19 shock on the German labour market. We find the consequences of the labour market shock to be highly regressive with a strong impact on the poorest households. However, this effect is nearly entirely offset by automatic stabilisers and discretionary policy measures. We explore the cushioning effect of these policies in detail, showing that short-time working schemes and especially the one-off payments for children are effective in cushioning the income loss of the poor.",

            "text": "The COVID-19 crisis led to a strong fall in economic activity and, consequently, to a severe drop in GDP and an increase in unemployment across Europe. In Germany, the recession in 2020 was about as significant as the financial crisis in 2008/2009, with a drop in GDP of about 5%. But also the labour market impact of the COVID-19 crisis was severe. While in February 2020 only about 133,000 workers were registered in short-time work (STW), this number rose sharply in March and April, with almost 6 million workers being moved to this scheme. 1 To counteract the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic, the German government strengthened and extended the existing STW scheme that already proved its worth during the financial crisis of 2008/2009. Moreover, several discretionary policy measures (DPM) were introduced. Both, STW and DPM had the goal to cushion against the income loss of households and to prevent a strong drop in private consumption. While the macroeconomic impact of the COVID-19 crisis has already been well documented (almost in real-time), evidence of the distributional impact on household income at the micro-level is more limited. This is largely due to missing real-time micro-data. In this study, we address this issue by simulating the impact of COVID-19 on the labour market and on household income across the income distribution in Germany in 2020. So far, the literature has employed two main approaches to overcome time lags in micro-data when assessing the impact of macroeconomic shocks. The first is a static approach that typically consists of updating the weights of individual observations in the micro-data to mirror up-to-date aggregate labour market statistics. For example, Almeida et al. (2021) use re-weighting techniques to update EU-SILC data and estimate the impact of COVID-19 on household income in EU countries. Beznoska et al. (2020) combine pre-crisis survey data with a questionnaire on subjective assessment of the labour market and the income loss of households via matching in order to estimate the impact of COVID-19 on household income in Germany. The second is a dynamic approach that employs labour market transition techniques to change the employment status of individuals in the micro-data to replicate labour market developments. For individuals who change their labour market status, taxes and benefits are updated consistently with the tax-benefit rules in place in each country. The key advantage of the labour market transition approach, that we also use in our analysis, with respect to re-weighting/matching is that this approach does not need to assume that the characteristics of the affected subgroup of the population (e.g. individuals in STW) remain unchanged. Moreover, by re-calculating taxes and benefits, it can account for changes in legislation including, for example, benefit amounts or eligibility conditions. Such an exercise is conducted by Cant\u00f3 et al. (2021) , who use labour market transition techniques for a selection of EU countries. Christl et al. (2021a) also used the labour market transition approach to estimate the impact of COVID-19 related policy measures in a cross-country setup for all EU countries, showing that policy measures were cushioning substantially the income loss and the inequality increasing feature of the COVID-19 pandemic. 2 1 In comparison to STW, the increase in unemployment during 2020 was less dramatic. In August 2020, the number of unemployed rose to almost 3 million, compared to about 2.3 million in March of the same year. 2 Country-specific analyses have been conducted by Christl et al. (2021b) for Austria, Marchal et al. (2021) for Belgium, Doorley et al. (2021) for Ireland and Brewer and Tasseva (2021) for the UK.",

            "text": "In this paper, we use EUROMOD, the microsimulation model of the European Union, to analyse the impact of the COVID-19 crisis on employees in Germany, as well as the role of STW in cushioning its effects on household income. We extend the labour market transition approach using both administrative data on the use of the STW scheme from the Federal Employment Agency (\"Bundesagentur f\u00fcr Arbeit\") as well as survey data from the HOPP database of the Institute of Employment Research (IAB) to estimate a probit model (based on a broad set of worker characteristics) to identify workers that move to STW schemes. 3 These data cover the whole year 2020, and they are used to update the EU-SILC microdata underpinning EUROMOD. We then employ this model to investigate the impact of COVID-19 on household income across the income distribution in Germany and, thus, its effect on inequality and poverty. We find that the COVID-19 crisis had a large impact on household income across the whole spectrum of the income distribution, with the average drop of market income in excess of 3%. The effect is largely regressive, indicating a significant increase in income inequality. However, the regressive impact on income is nearly entirely offset by automatic stabilisers (such as unemployment benefits) and DPM introduced during the crisis (notably, child-related COVID-19 benefits and a tax allowance for single parents). We find that the STW scheme and DPM played a much greater role in stabilising the income of households located in the bottom half of the income distribution than of those sitting in the upper half. Indeed, in the absence of STW and DPM, richer households would have seen their disposable income mostly unaffected, while the poorest households would have faced the largest loss in disposable income.",

            "text": "Our work contributes to the literature along several lines. First, we simulate wage compensation schemes on a micro-level using a methodology of labour market transition based on micro-simulation techniques. This allows us to transit individuals to both unemployment and STW schemes. Second, we use detailed administrative data on the number of people in STW schemes and unemployment in 2020. For workers in STW schemes, these data also allow us to model the duration and reduction of working hours for a more precise assessment of the impact of the COVID-19 crisis on the German labour market. Third, we compare different modelling approaches for selecting individuals in the micro-data who change their labour market status in response to the crisis. We show that such a modelling choice substantially affects the estimation of the impact of the COVID-19 crisis across the income distribution. Contrary to the results found using traditional approaches (which are based on either re-weighting or stochastic labour market transitions), we find that using the extended labour market transition approach the impact of the COVID-19 crisis on disposable household income is quite similar in size across the income distribution. Fourth, we add to the discussion on the cushioning effect of STW and discretionary policy measures. In particular, we show that STW and DPM in Germany are increasing the income stabilising mechanism, especially for low-income earners.",

            "text": "The literature on the distributional impact of the Covid crisis for Germany is scarce. In addition to the few papers mentioned above, Bruckmeier et al. (2021) extend the approach of Bargain et al. (2012) and combine macro-and micro-modelling to nowcast the macroeconomic effect of COVID-19 in Germany in 2020. The key difference of their approach to our analysis is in the selection of individuals who experience a shock. 4 Similarly to our analysis, they analyse the impact on the labour market and household income. They find a substantial decrease in gross labour income across the income distribution. However, the tax benefit system and discretionary policy responses to the crisis are able to cushion this effect, leading to a progressive effect of the COVID crisis. As we show in the Appendix, this would have also been the case in our analysis had we selected at random the individuals who experience the labour market transition in each sector of the economy. Instead, by using a probit model controlling for a broad set of worker characteristic, we can account for the fact that individuals in the lower part of the income distribution are more likely to enter in the STW schemes. 5 This shows the importance of accounting for worker characteristics when simulating labour market transitions in micro data instead of using the sector of activity alone. Moreover, our analysis of income stabilisation effects as well as more detailed STW and DPM responses using counterfactual scenarios is novel compared to Bruckmeier et al. (2021) .",

The benefit compensates employees for wage losses due to an involuntary decrease in working hours. All employees subject to social insurance contributions are entitled to the scheme if the employer applies (and qualifies) for reduced working hours. The benefit amount is calculated based on the difference in net earnings before and after the reduction of working hours. In more detail, the amount is set to 60% of the difference in net earnings for individuals without children and 67% for individuals with children. Importantly, the system of STW that existed before the pandemic was further expanded at the beginning of the pandemic, both in terms of access and of monthly rates. Specifically, employees who received the compensation for more than four months in 2020 (and whose working hours were reduced by at least 50%) had their compensation rate increased to 70% in the fifth and in the sixth month (77% for beneficiaries with children). From the seventh month, the rate increased to 80% for individuals without children and to 87% for parents. In addition, from March 2020, temporary employees were also entitled to the compensation. Employers could use the scheme already if 10% or more of their employees were affected by the lack of work, while before the pandemic this limit was set to 30%. Another change due to the COVID-19 pandemic is that the basic social security contributions to be paid by the employer are paid by the unemployment insurance. Finally, the German government decided to prolong the current scheme until December 2021, whereas originally this benefit was only paid for a maximum of 12 months.",

Therefore, a rigorous classification would require to separate the role of the structural component of the STW (i.e the part pre-existing the COVID crisis) from its extension (i.e the part introduced in response to the COVID crisis).

In more detail, the tax allowance was increased from 1,908 euro per year in 2019 to 4,008 euro per year in 2020 and 2021. The goal of this policy is to compensate single parents for the higher costs of living during the COVID-19 crisis. 9 Finally, another important class of policies are those introduced to sustain selfemployed and small businesses. These notably include the \"Soforthilfe\", i.e. the immediate assistance program for small businesses and self-employed. \"Soforthilfe\" is a one-off benefit which was introduced to pay for current expenses and to compensate for the operating losses during the lockdown. 10 Even though these measures are implemented in EUROMOD, we do not include them in our analysis because of the lack of information on operating losses and on the number of individuals using the scheme. This is clearly a drawback of our analysis, since, as highlighted by Graeber et al. (2021) , self-employed are more likely to suffer an income loss due to COVID-19 than employees.",

            "text": "Generally speaking, two main approaches are employed to introduce demographic and labour market shocks in the micro-data. The first approach is a static technique, which typically consists of updating individual observations in the micro-data to mirror up-to-date labour market statistics. This is typically achieved by re-weighting, that is, by updating the weights of individual observations in the micro-data to meet target statistics, such as the updated unemployment rate (see e.g. Creedy, 2004; Dolls et al., 2019; Almeida et al., 2021) . Alternatively, this can be achieved by matching procedures that combine older micro-data with individual-level information on the effects of a labour market shock, for example, incomeloss questionnaires as in Beznoska et al. (2020) . However, such a static approach has significant shortcomings when the characteristics of the relevant population groups (e.g. the unemployed population) change substantially. That is because by re-weighting/matching existing observations, it implicitly assumes that the characteristics of this subgroup of the population remain largely unchanged. Moreover, policy changes, such as a change in the benefit amount or the eligibility conditions, cannot be taken into account in detail. The second approach is a dynamic technique, which is based on the implementation of the labour market transition of individuals, as explained in detail in Gasior and Rastrigina (2017) . More specifically, this method alters the employment status of individual observations in the micro-data consistently with up-to-date statistics and updates their incomes and labour market variables accordingly. For individuals affected by the transition, taxes and benefits are recalculated consistently with the tax-benefit rules in place in a given country. For example, if an individual \"is transited\" from employment to unemployment, the underlying microsimulation model will apply the policy rules in place to determine her unemployment benefits entitlement, as well as to reevaluate her entitlement for any other benefits and liability for taxes. This dynamic approach is preferable to the static one especially in times of rapid changes in the labour market and when policy changes have taken place. Hence, it is arguably better suited for the analysis of the COVID-19 crisis.",

As can be appreciated from the figure, when the COVID-19 crisis hit the German labour market in March 2020, firms reacted by moving people to STW schemes. This is an expected development, given the long tradition of STW in Germany. While in February 2020 only about 133,000 workers were registered in STW, they rose sharply in March and April, with almost 6 million workers being moved to STW. Their number started decreasing in May and stabilised by the end of the year. In December, about 2.2 million employees were registered in STW. In comparison to STW, the increase in unemployment during 2020 appears less dramatic; nonetheless, its increase was significant. In March, about 2.3 million people were registered as unemployed, with this number rising to almost 3 million in August, an increase of nearly one-third.",

In April, about 36% of all workers in STW schemes belonged to the manufacturing sector, followed by wholesale and retail (about 15%), and accommodation and food services (about 11%). Instead, in the third and fourth wave, it was mainly the accommodation and food service sector that was hit.

We therefore estimate a probit model that allows us to identify in our micro-data those individuals that are more likely to change their labour market status in response to the COVID-19 crisis. For this purpose, we use administrative data obtained by the Institute of Employment Research (IAB) through the online survey \"Leben und Erwerbst\u00e4tigkeit in Zeiten von Corona (HOPP)\". 15 This is a representative random sample, including individuals at least 18-years-old at the time of the interview. The data were collected monthly between May and September 2020. We use the total information of these four waves of the survey to estimate the average probability across the year 2020 to transit to STW. The sample is drawn from register data, which allows us to add additional information related to the characteristics of individuals. For a more detailed description and a summary of the HOPP survey, see Haas et al. (2021) and Sakshaug et al. (2020) . The IAB then used the HOPP data to estimate a probit model that estimates the probability of being in STW schemes, given the characteristics of individual workers. 16 Table 2 shows the average marginal effects of the probit estimation for Germany and highlights that there are substantial differences across individuals. 17 Similar to what Brewer and Tasseva (2021) found for the UK, also in Germany, individuals in low-income households are significantly more likely to transit to STW. A disposable household income below 1500 euro monthly increases the 15 See Volkert et al. (2021) . 16 See also Kruppe and Osiander (2020) for an estimation for May 2020, detailed data description can be found in Haas et al.

The probit estimates are very stable across the year 2020. probability of being in STW by almost 10 percentage points compared to the reference category (someone with a disposable household income between 2,000 and 3,000 euro). Additionally, women are less likely to be in STW compared to men. Also, there seems to be no significant difference in the probability of being in STW across age groups, except for people above 60, who are less likely to be in STW. Having a partner, as well as having a foreign citizenship, also significantly increases the probability for people to be in STW. Table 1 Distribution of hours reduction for workers in STW in 2020",

Source: Own calculation based on data from the Federal Employment Agency (\"Bundesagentur f\u00fcr Arbeit\") Based on the estimated coefficients of the probit model, we predict the probability of each individual in the EU-SILC data being in STW (adding a random error term). Instead of randomly choosing people that transit to STW schemes in each sector, we chose according to our probit model. In more detail, we order individuals based on the difference between their predicted probability of moving to STW and a random draw from a uniform distribution (this difference can be positive or negative). Starting from individuals whose difference is the largest, we then select individuals to move to STW until the target share by sector (i.e. the share observed in the administrative data) is reached. As a result, we proportionally move more low-income earners as well as more males and individuals without children to STW. It is worth mentioning that this modelling choice has substantial consequences for the results presented later. In Appendix 1, we highlight the differences compared to choosing individuals at random by sector (as done in previous work) in more detail. Note: */**/*** means significant at 10%/5%/1% level; Reading example: A marginal effect of \u22120.039 for females means that cet. par. women are 3.9 percentage points less likely to be in STW than the reference category (men On the other hand, the low number of individuals observed as new unemployed in the HOPP data do not allow us to estimate a probit model on the probability to enter in unemployment. Therefore, workers moving to unemployment are selected based on a random assignment by sector of activity. 18 To macro-validate our model calibration, we estimate the increase in the costs for STW schemes when modelling the transition on the labour market. Our model suggests an additional cost for the government of about 19.7 billion euro. The Federal Employment Agency (\"Bundesagentur f\u00fcr Arbeit\") reported costs of about 21 billion euro, which is slightly above our estimates. 19 Additionally, we validate our model by comparing the share of workers that we transit to STW by income group with the one observed in the HOPP data. 20 As Table 3 highlights, our model performs well in this dimension, although we slightly overestimate the share of low-income households and slightly underestimate the one of high income households; differences are nonetheless minor.",

We observe that the COVID-19 crisis caused a significant reduction of market income across the whole spectrum of the income distribution, with an overall drop of almost 3 % . This effect is largely regressive, with households in the lowest deciles of the income distribution losing a substantially higher share of their market income than those in the highest deciles. This is not surprising given that higher-skilled workers have been far less disrupted by the COVID-19 crisis (e.g. because they can work from home, their sectors of activities have been less exposed to the crisis, etc.). Once taxes and benefits are accounted for, the drop in income is greatly mitigated, with an average fall in disposable income in the order of 0.5% . However, the regressive effect is only partially reversed. Indeed, the impact on disposable income is somehow flattened across the distribution. Our estimated impact is close to the one estimated by Bruckmeier et al. (2021) , who predict a fall in disposable income of a similar magnitude. However, differently from us, they find the effect of the COVID-19 crisis to be slightly progressive. In this regard, it should be noted that this would have also been the case in our analysis had we selected at random the individuals who experience the labour market transition in each sector of the economy (see Fig. 5 in the Appendix). Instead, by using a probit model, we can account for the fact that individuals in the lower part of the income distribution are more likely to enter in the STW schemes. 22 This shows the importance of accounting for a broader set of worker characteristics when simulating labour market transitions in micro data instead of using the sector of activity alone. 23 We now turn to explore the contribution of STW and DPM in cushioning the effect of the COVID-19 crisis on household income. For this purpose, we construct a counterfactual scenario without the STW scheme and the DPM. We then compare it with the COVID-19 scenario where these policies are instead in place (see the detailed description of the scenarios in Sect. 3.1.2).",

In particular, without STW and DPM, the impact on disposable income remains largely regressive, with the lowest three deciles suffering an income reduction that is twice as large.

Figure 4 shows the stabilisation coefficient and its breakdown for the COVID-19 scenario with STW and DPM and for the scenario where they are not in place (respectively, in panel a and panel b). Starting with 4a, we can appreciate that the German tax-benefit system, including STW and DPM, was able to absorb about 85% of the income shock caused by the COVID-19 crisis in 2020 in total. In other words, a loss of 100 euro in market income only translated into a loss of 15 euro of disposable income. Moreover income stabilisation, ranging between 93% in the lowest decile to 79% in the highest decile, was stronger for low income earners indicating that the tax-benefit system in Germany protected poorer households more than richer ones. Looking at the income stabilisation by individual components of the tax-benefit system, it appears that for poorer households this is largely driven by STW and DPM, whereas for richer households the reverse effect of the progressive income taxation plays the most important role. The DPM, in particular the one-off payment for households with children, absorb a higher share of income loss in the first decile, due to the nature of this benefit (lump-sum) and the lower market income loss in relative terms, experienced by households in the first decile.",

We find that the income stabilisation capacity substantially reduces, especially for lowincome earners. In more detail, the ISC drops to about 69% for low-income earners. Also, for households in the middle of the income distribution, the stabilisation effect drops below 80% (ranging between 73% and 77%). This is explained by the fact that individuals in the lower decile are more likely to have a discontinuous working history. Therefore, in the COVID-19 scenario without STW and DPM they might be not eligible for unemployment benefit. Moreover, the lack of DPM (mainly the COVID-related child benefit) and the slightly lower income stabilisation that unemployment benefits offers compared to STW schemes, appears to play a significant role.",

On the contrary, households with more than one adult (including those with more children) have lower poverty rates. The labour market shock caused by COVID-19 is expected to increase these poverty rates substantially. In the COVID-19 scenario without STW and DPM, the overall AROP rate increases significantly to 14.9%. The increase is particularly large for families with children, the increase in poverty is significant (+1.9 pp). But also for single-person households of working age we observe a significant increase (i.e. 1.2 pp), mostly because when these individuals lose their jobs, they cannot count on income received by other household members. Even in the COVID-19 scenario where STW and DPM are in place, the overall AROP rate increases, although to a substantially smaller extent (14.2%). In this scenario, AROP rates for families with more than 2 children and for single-parent families do not increase. This result is expected given they are the target groups of the discretionary policy measures (child bonus and a higher tax allowance for single-parents) and because of the higher replacement rate of STW for individuals with children. It suggests that discretionary policy measures were essential in protecting single-parent households, which is the group with the highest AROP. Altogether, our findings suggest that, in spite of the regressive nature of the COVID-19 crisis, STW and DPM have largely offset its impact of the pandemic on inequality and poverty.",

However, the fall in market income was largely offset by the tax-benefit system, which softened the reduction in disposable income to a more modest 0.5%. Indeed, the German taxbenefit system, together with the DPM introduced in response to the COVID-19 crisis, are estimated to absorb about 85% of the income shock, with a stronger stabilisation for low income earners.",

This is especially true for single-parent families and for households with more than two children who benefit from the DPM, as well as from the higher replacement rate of STW for individuals with children.

The absence of real-time data can lead to severe problems in evaluating the impact of such a crisis, especially when it comes to income inequality. Contrary to the results found using traditional approaches (which are based on either re-weighting or stochastic labour market transitions), we find that the impact of the COVID-19 crisis on disposable household income is quite similar in size across the income distribution (between 0.2 and 0.6%). Therefore, using the extended labour market transition approach provides an important technique also for the analysis of future macroeconomic shocks, because it allows to account for worker characteristics when simulating labour market transitions in micro-data.",

            "text": "There are two approaches taken in the literature to define people that are moving to STW. In the first approach, detailed aggregate statistics on the amount of workers in STW schemes are used (usually by sector) based on the argument that a sectorspecific random allocation (or even more detailed components) might cover well the heterogeneity in characteristics of workers that transit to STW schemes. 25 Since the COVID-19 shock in 2020 was strongly defined by a sectorial component that was mainly driven by lockdowns that hit specific sectors more than others, such as tourism, hotels and bars, this assumption seems to be reasonable on first glance. On the other hand, other approaches, such as that employed by Brewer and Tasseva (2021) , use specific micro-data to estimate the probability of a worker moving to STW schemes. This approach allows for the estimation of the risk of a worker moving to short-time work.We compare both approaches in our paper on Germany using the probit model (discussed in Sect. 3.2) to analyse the impact of the modelling choice related to transition to STW. We compare the random allocation by sectors with the allocation where those workers with the highest risk of being sent to STW transit. Figure 5 already highlights the strong distributional impact of the modelling assumption. While according to the probit model low-income earners have a higher risk of being sent to STW schemes, the sectorial approach, where people are randomly sent to STW in each sector, does not cover this fact well.As we have shown, when using the detailed information on worker heterogeneity in STW schemes, the effect on disposable income is regressive. By contrast, when",
