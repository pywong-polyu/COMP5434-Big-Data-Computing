In fact, Greenhawt et. al recently suggested using the 2012 parameters for patients with an a prior documented allergy to one of the mRNA vaccines. 9 Many of our patients who have experienced anaphylaxis express hesitancy towards receiving vaccines due to fears of anaphylaxis and continue to delay their COVID-19 vaccination. To meet this demand, we offered skin testing with mRNA vaccines for our patients who requested evaluation of their risk of anaphylaxis.",

Patients were probed for self-reported reactions to PEG containing products (i.e. toothpaste and colonoscopy prep). Patients' ages ranged from 27 to 80 years old.

After recording the final wheal size, pictures of the skin tests were taken, patients were observed for an additional 30 minutes, and patients were requested to submit pictures of their skin test at 4 to 6 hours after testing to assess late phase reactions and at 24 hours after testing to assess delayed reactions.

Six patients had late phase reactions without immediate reactions. Unfortunately, most patients did not comply with our request to submit delayed reaction pictures. Patients with positive immediate reactions were recommended to receive the Janssen Covid-19 vaccine. Patients with negative immediate reactions (n=25) were recommended to receive their choice of Covid-19 vaccine. None of the patients with negative skin test to an mRNA vaccine who were subsequently vaccinated to Covid-19 (n=19, confirmed through records in the Tennessee Immunization Information System) have had any allergic reaction to vaccination.

Additionally, 3 patients with only positive late phase reactions to skin testing did not experience reactions to vaccination. Consequently, skin testing should be considered as an adjunct procedure to evaluate risk for patients with a history of anaphylaxis, especially when the patients are delaying vaccination. These data are limited due to our reliance on self-reporting and small sample size. Furthermore, patients with positive immediate reactions to skin testing were advised to receive the Janssen vaccine, therefore the positive predictive value of skin testing cannot be determined. Importantly, testing with the vaccine carries risk of causing anaphylaxis (as documented by 1 patient in our cohort), which is similar to the reporting of skin testing with PEG. 6 Consequently, skin testing with the mRNA vaccines needs to be performed according to AAAAI guidelines.
