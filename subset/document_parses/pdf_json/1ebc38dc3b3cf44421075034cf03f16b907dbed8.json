            "text": "On 11 June 2020, the World Health Organization's special envoy, Dr David Nabarro, was invited to take part in a sitting of the Oireachtas 1 Special Committee on Covid-19. On that occasion, he rated the Republic of Ireland's response to the ongoing epidemic \"to a high level\". 2 By then, the country's epidemic curve had flattened and the disease's R 0 was well below 1. Despite widespread agreement that this had been achieved through rapid and effective response in March 2020, Ireland's journey through the pandemic was no easy ride. In order to contain the virus, the Government's emergency legislation imposed draconian measures including the detention and isolation of people deemed to be even \"a potential source of infection\" and a significant extension of An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na's power of arrest. 3 The mixed reception of the Irish State's reaction to the pandemic was a strong motivation for this research, aimed at performing a multi-level analysis of the Irish public discourse on Covid-19. In Sect. 2, to begin with, the legislative background to Ireland's Covid strategy is briefly described. In Sect. 3, secondly, judicial argumentation is discussed as the research area closest to the investigation undertaken here. Section 4 is actually devoted to the analysis of the Irish High Court's argumentative discourse in O'Doherty and Waters v. Minister for Health and Attorney General, a case that made headlines as a symbol of the controversial nature of anti-Covid legislation. Section 5, finally, assesses the relevance of the study in the context of the EU public debate on Covid response. as libraries and museums, while at the same time recommendations were issued to cancel large gatherings. After St. Patrick festivities were duly called off, the vast majority of businesses, venues and amenities were shut on 24 March. 6 In response to repeated calls to Leinster House for appropriate public health measures, the (by then) outgoing Government, led by Fine Gael and headed by Leo Varadkar TD, brought in two Acts of the Oireachtas in quick succession, i.e. the Health (Preservation and Protection and other Emergency Measures in the Public Interest) Act 2020 7 and the Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (Covid-19) Act 2020. 8 Interestingly, the language of both Acts invokes broad principles such as \"common good\", \"compelling reasons of public interest\" and the \"exigencies of public health\"; goals like the \"beneficial, effective and efficient use of resources\" and \"the need to act expeditiously\"; and the constitutional \"duty of the State to respect and, as far as practicable, by its laws to defend and vindicate the rights of citizens to life and to bodily integrity\". It is in the name of such principles, goals and duties that it was allegedly \"necessary to introduce a range of extraordinary measures and safeguards\" and take \"extraordinary measures\" during an emergency period the Government reserved the right to extend \"for such period as they consider appropriate\".",

[2, p. 6] ). In this vein, the common good is by definition presented as an end the members of the community should strive to attain. Public interest has often been used interchangeably with common good. Yet although the two notions are somehow inter-related, a distinction seems worth drawing between them.",

[2] , the concept of public interest became fashionable across the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, when it was used in relation to goals such as national security and prosperity enlightened monarchs were expected to work towards through their foreign and economic policies. Later on, it became more intimately linked to the social philosophies of liberalism, utilitarianism and democratic pluralism. Behind such semantic shift, as it were, was a vision of society \"as a rational alliance of primarily self-interested individuals whose own 'good' is made up of a complex of private interests. The public interest then refers to the aggregation of the private interests of individuals\" coming together in an attempt to gain mutual advantage (Jennings et al. [2, p. 6] ). While safeguarding the integrity of the social arrangements that regulate social life in an orderly manner, the promotion of public interest is therefore designed to advance individual interest by balancing competing benefits (Douglass [3, p. 112] ).",

First of all, they have consistently posed genuine dilemmas because of their inherent vagueness (cf. also the adjective reasonable later in this section). In other words, they all too often appeared to be used as signifiers whose meaning is wide and whose boundaries (if any could be said to exist) have been blurred as a result. Quoting Federal Court of Australia's Tamberlin J. in McKinnon v. Secretary, Department of Treasury [2005] , for instance, Wheeler [4, p. 14] draws attention to the indeterminate nature of the concept of public interest: \"the expression 'in the public interest',\" the Justice argued, \"directs attention to that conclusion or determination which best serves the advancement of the interest or welfare of the public, society or the nation and its content will depend on each particular set of circumstances\".",

In this respect, Zarefski [5] stresses the role of persuasive definitions, through which an entity is characterised in a wilfully biased manner, so that positive or negative attitudes are expressed about it while naming it. The name chosen to refer to the entity embeds an argument that the thing itself should be viewed from a certain perspective. Furthermore, the argument is never explicitly raised: rather, \"the definition is put forward as if it was uncontroversial and could be easily stipulated. The argument in behalf of the proposed definition is simply 'smuggled in' through the use of the definition itself\" (Zarefski [5, p. 404] ). In our case, more specifically, controversial legislation may be pushed through and made more palatable to the public opinion by rebranding it as a set of measures designed to pursue the common good and public interest.",

The implementation of such measures looms large in Giorgio Agamben's [6] theorisation of 'state of exception' in modern parliamentary democracies. Following the Italian philosopher, the First World War and its aftermath served as a laboratory to experiment with and put in place legal procedures that would soon lead to the state of exception as routine government practice, its distinctive traits being a temporary abolition of the division of powers. Underlying the state of exception has been the hypothesis that the balance of powers underpinning democratic regimes is devised to work in 'normal' circumstances, so to speak. In times of crisis, therefore, constitutional government can be altered to whatever extent is required to avert dangers and restore normality. By definition, such alterations almost invariably imply stronger government action.",

            "text": "Against this backdrop, the state of exception may result in the adoption of measures which by themselves and at first sight appear to be contrary to the rule of law and therefore \"illegal\" yet they are somehow perfectly \"constitutional\" in that they are instrumental in establishing the new legal order dictated by the emergency (Santi Romano 1909, in Agamben [6, p. 38] ). When this is taken to extremes, the state of exception is created on the grounds of emergencies arising less from substantiated facts than subjectively and arbitrarily. This is the case of exceptional circumstances declared as such by governments inclined to artificially and deliberately create gaps in the legal order that can only be filled through extraordinary measures. Accordingly, these are presented as a suitable remedy and one to be resorted to to eventually justify their ongoing implementation even as normality has been reinstated. Hence a trend, which Agamben [6, p. 16] sees as growing well into the late twentieth century if not beyond, to establish the state of exception more as a governance model and a paradigm than a mere ruling technique, as it were. This is not to say that such was the state of emergency declared by the Irish Government in March 2020. However, the debate shaped by the issues raised above seems very relevant to Ireland as well as all other EU Member States where Covid-19 posed grave threats to the lives and livelihoods of so many people. If nothing else, it demonstrates the importance of compelling evidence based on scientific facts as a solid background to the emergency response coordinated by governments in the context of countries' legal order. This will be apparent from the analysis in Sect. 4 of the judgment mentioned later in this section.",

As a result, for instance, landlords were not allowed to serve notices of termination in relation to the tenancy of dwellings and all proposed evictions were prohibited during the operation of the Act, while rent increases were prevented from taking effect over the same period. Moreover, with a view to the prospective deployment of the army with contact-tracing tasks, among others, people who had served in the Permanent Defence Force could be re-enlisted to \"address a deficiency, within the Defence Forces, of necessary skills or expertise\" (p. 27).",

The second element is the great flexibility behind Garda prerogatives offered by the extensive use of the adjective reasonable.

Amid tight security around the Four Courts complex, Mr Waters reportedly defined the case as \"one of the most important in our history\", while Ms O'Doherty added that her and Mr Waters' claims were arguable, so that the Court should grant them leave to bring the challenge. 10 As Justice Meenan declined to grant leave, stating that it was incumbent on the applicants to prove that the threshold for granting permission had been crossed, the proceedings attracted widespread media coverage in what soon became a debate on the legitimacy of emergency legislation and the notion of 'fake news' itself.

In Alexy's view, a normative statement is not true or acceptable unless the judgement could be the result of rational discourse. The underlying notion is that the rationality of the justification of legal decisions goes hand in hand with the quality of procedures in the justification process. Since the acceptability of normative statements is correlated with a certain procedure, Alexy's theory is by all means a normative procedural theory. In this context, he defines legal argumentation as a form of practical argumentation and formulates a general theory of rational practical discourse that can be adapted to the domain of legal argumentation.",

Based on the first mode of justification, evidence is provided that decisions can be adequately defended within the context of the legal tradition. As for deep justification, conclusive arguments should be advanced that the legal starting points and argumentation rules are defensible in the light of general moral grounds. Peczenik therefore puts forward a theory behind the two modes of justification. On such grounds, he suggests that the two forms of justification are associated with two components of the theory. One is designed to elucidate the requirements a legal justification must meet, so that a specific legal rule underpins a legal decision, while the other outlines the requirements that a deep justification is to fulfil.",

In this regard, it views legal justification as an argumentative activity type and focuses on the role of judges in their capacity as officials entrusted with the resolution of differences of opinion on the merits [12] . Different argumentative patterns in legal justification are reconstructed and characterised as prototypical configurations arising from the obligations of courts to justify their decisions.

In a trenchant critique of the Government's modus operandi, the applicants then disputed the accuracy of the figures related to the number of people infected by the virus as well as the number of deaths. Finally, they referred to the first named respondent, i.e. Minister for Health Simon Harris TD, \"as acting on 'fraudulent science'\" and causing \"the arrival of a 'police state'\", to such an extent that they drew a parallel between Ireland and Nazi Germany (p. 18) .",

Consequently, Mr Waters and Ms O'Doherty had standing to challenge the constitutionality of the relevant sections of both Acts.

            "text": "Delivering a lecture at the Cornell Law School in April 1941, high-profile American lawyer John Lord O'Brian noted that freedom in expression of opinion was being suppressed in a major part of the civilized world. He went on to say that only twenty years before, attempts had been made in the United States itself to invoke the powers of government to curtail freedom \"in the expression of honest opinion\": such freedom, he was then to suggest, \"is not inconsistent with the right of the nation in time of grave national danger to protect itself against utterances intended to weaken its power of self defense\" [sic] (Lord O'Brien [25, p. 529] ). However blurred the boundary line of limitation may seem at times, he acknowledged, the distinction is a valid one and should be there. The world has gone a long way since the calamitous years of Lord O'Brian's words. Nevertheless, the debate over legislatures' restraints upon individual freedom in times of national emergency has remained lively, and it has been more than ever over the past two years. Indeed, the dramatic spread of the Covid-19 pandemic across Europe led EU Member States to enact a range of emergency measures in order to suppress the virus as effectively as possible. The vast majority of EU governments have availed of emergency powers to limit internal and international travel, implement sanitary controls, shut schools and universities, shops and public places and confine citizens at home. This resulted in restrictions to individual freedom of movement and assembly, while contact tracing, location tracking and data analysis measures had a perceived impact on privacy and data protection standards. To various extents, fines and prison terms were given serious consideration and, if necessary, imposed on persons for violating restrictive measures. The right to apply for asylum was temporarily suspended throughout the EU and restrictive measures were instituted in relation to visits to detainees. At the same time, vulnerable individuals were increasingly exposed to risks of discriminations and violence as legal proceedings were called off in many countries and deadlines were extended.",

Because European history provides ample evidence that states of emergency can turn democratic governments acting on the rule of law and enforcing fundamental rights into oppressive regimes, such worries appear genuine. As Marzocchi [26, p. 3] argues, State of emergency and similar regimes importantly imply an increase of the powers of the government (sometimes also of the police and the army) and a diminishing of the powers of Parliaments and of the judiciary, with a serious blurring of the lines separating executive, legislative and judicial powers and causing a disbalance in the system of checks and balances that are at the basis of democracy.",

In more detail, through the valuable analysis tools developed by pragmadialectics (Sect. 4), a case study was carried out to describe the arguments advanced by journalists John Waters and Gemma O'Doherty to challenge the Government's emergency measures, and to undertake an in-depth examination of the argument structure of Meenan J.'s High Court judgment in the case they brought.",

The notion of \"strategic maneuvering\" refers to \"the continual efforts made in all moves that are carried out in argumentative discourse to keep the balance between reasonableness and effectiveness\" (Van Eemeren [27, p. 40] ). The term \"maneuvering\" typically indicates a planned movement produced to gain advantage over someone, and it appears well suited to argumentative contexts, where the participants' predicament to combine reasonableness and effectiveness in principle gets them to maneuver strategically to bring about the intended perlocutionary effect of the interlocutor's acceptance of one's standpoint. Strategic maneuvering constitutes an integral part of the extended pragma-dialectical model, where it is to be understood alongside the rules of critical discussion pertinent to the resolution of differences of opinion on the merits.",

In this respect, the narrative upheld by the High Court, whereby the proportionality of Government legislation needs to be assessed on the basis of updated facts as opposed to \"unsubstantiated opinions, speeches, empty rhetoric and bogus\" historical parallels (examples 2 and 3 above), seems a particularly compelling one in the era of fake news and overall Covid misinformation we have been living through. In this regard, the study of judicial argumentation provides a coherent framework to establish the structure of argumentative discourse and its capability to actively engage competing arguments in a country's public sphere [29, 30] .",

It comprises the President of the High Court, notably the second most senior judge in the state, \"and such number of ordinary judges as may from time to time be fixed by Act of the Oireachtas\" (Byrne et al. [18, p. 151]). The Court operates as a superior court of record: as such, it has full original jurisdiction in as well as power to determine all matters of law or fact, civil and criminal. It hears appeals to Circuit Court judgments in civil matters and, most importantly, it has the power to assess and determine the validity of any law in light of the letter of the Constitution. It is in this last capacity that the Court was to hear submissions by Mr Waters and Ms O'Doherty as the applicants in case O'Doherty and Waters v. Minister for Health and Attorney General, as anticipated earlier on.",
