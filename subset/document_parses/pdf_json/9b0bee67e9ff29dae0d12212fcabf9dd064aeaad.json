These included infection prevention and control measures, that is, promotion of the use of masks along with following regular and thorough hand hygiene practices through handwashing with soap and water or alcohol-based hand rub, international and internal travel-related restrictions, and following social distancing (5, 6) . Although randomized controlled trials (RCTs) demonstrate that personal protective measures such as hand hygiene and face masks have a small effect on respiratory infection transmission, higher compliance in a severe pandemic might improve the effectiveness (5, (7) (8) (9) . However, adoption of such protective behaviors for curbing the spread of influenza and social distancing policies were reported of being of uncertain effectiveness, expensive, unpopular, difficult to implement (10) (11) (12) , and highly disruptive to society (5, 13) . However, in the absence of a vaccine, behavioral strategies for reducing the transmission of COVID-19 are vital to the global pandemic response (14) . The efficacy and impact of these strategies depend on the compliance of the community and their cooperation. Historically, the adoption of such behaviors has depended on many factors related to personal perceptions and beliefs about the effectiveness of the preventive measures, the perceived risk of contracting the disease by self or family, and the perceived severity of health and economic consequences (15) (16) (17) (18) .",

Adults answering the call were given information about the study. One participant from each contacted household was selected randomly using the Kish method. In case the participant selected did not understand or respond in Marathi or not able to provide the informed consent (not able to hear or speak), resampling of the participant from the same household was conducted. At least six attempts were made to contact the household or the participant at different times ( Table 1) . The participants were interviewed as per their availability between 8:00 a.m. and 10:00 p.m. and the survey lasted for approximately 30 minutes. If the adult in the household was selected or if the participant refused to participate, they were considered as household or participant refusal, respectively. If participants decided to withdraw their participation from the study after consenting then they were counted as \"discontinued.\" In case, the male members or the head of household refused to give an appointment for the female members to be interviewed from the family, they were offered an option for a female surveyor to call them at a time convenient to them. An SMS was sent out to a household contact or participants to request their participation in the study, to participants who never answered calls or continued asking the surveyor to call them back later each time they called, and to those who disconnected calls or refused to participate before hearing about the study and ignored subsequent calls from the study team.

The third round of the serosurvey conducted in India in August-September 2020 and December 2020-January 2021 showed an increase in seroprevalence in the urban areas, while the rural population is still at risk and surveillance has been recommended (27, 28) . We conducted an epidemiological survey aimed at assessing knowledge, attitudes, and practices and identifying opportunities to target interventions to contain the spread of COVID-19 infection in rural and semi-urban regions of India. When compared with a study conducted in Nigeria (29) , most of the study participants reported accurate knowledge and compliance with following the protective measures. The majority of the current study participants reported maintaining social distancing, frequent handwashing with soap and water, wearing a mask while leaving the house, and obeying government advisories. The study conducted by Dkhar et al. in April, 2020 among social media users in Jammu and Kashmir, showed similar results that respondents exhibited good knowledge, positive attitudes regarding COVID-19 during the pandemic with most of them reporting regularly wearing masks, washing hands with soap and water regularly, following lockdown guidelines, and maintaining social distancing (30) . Similarly, cross-sectional online survey conducted in India also showed the correct rate of knowledge (74.7%), perception (57.6%), and practices (88.1%) toward COVID-19 (31) . While closer to the outbreak, reports showed poor attitudes toward disease prevention and control in Thailand (32) .",

The accurate knowledge of COVID-19 reported by the participants and compliance with following personal protective measures in this study could be attributed to the months-long campaigning efforts targeted toward making messaging more effective through pre-recorded public local announcements and using locally available resources, such as rickshaw/tempo in the rural areas of Maharashtra, India (33) . In addition, local news resources have reported that community social workers are utilizing innovative and simplified ways of using umbrellas to explain social distancing (34). Several regions during this data collection period were considered as containment and microcontainment zones where the village borders and also smaller localities were sealed. The local news resources reported that this led to fear and panic among the communities (35, 36) . This may imply active observation and discussions within groups in these study areas, facilitated through the local healthcare providers, social workers, and local announcements, which have the trust of the community. GoI launched a \"jan andolan\" (public campaign) for COVID-19 appropriate behaviors (37) .",

Low self-risk perception is contrary to the findings reported during the early stage of the pandemic in China, where studies showed more than 70% of the respondents were worried about them or a family member acquiring the infection (38) (39) (40) . Similar to the current study findings, low-risk perception (median score of 5 out of 10) was reported in a study conducted in the United States (41) . This low self-risk perception in the present study is an indication of complacency that might set in once prevention fatigue rises in the community. It could also result in vaccine hesitancy. Therefore, local communication strategies should emphasize creating public awareness and bringing about a behavior change through population tailored interventions to help communities sustain following protective measures, since, it is likely that adherence to protective measures may not be sustained when the penalties are revoked. Further, novel approaches to estimate compliance with lockdown measures in the COVID-19 pandemic may be adopted (42) . In addition, face masks are proposed to be the most obvious measure to prevent transmission and they can generate peer pressure kind of response in the communities (43) . It would be important to continue with efforts for personal protective measures to avoid a false sense of security among those who receive vaccine which is currently being rolled out (43) .",

In 2014, during the Ebola outbreak, anxiety-depression and symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) were more prevalent even after 1 year of Ebola response (45) . Mental health concerns, such as stress, anxiety, depression, insomnia, denial, anger, and fear were reported by Roy et al. through a scientific review (44) . In the context of India, mental health concerns of the COVID-19 pandemic may be more complex due to a large proportion of the socially and economically vulnerable population, migrant workers, and laborers who have been reported to be affected the most. In India, within hours of the lockdown announcement on March 25, 2020, millions of migrant laborers began reverse migration (46, 47) . The phenomenon produced loneliness, panic, fear, feelings of isolation, and economic anxiety. The migrant workers having a serious nervous breakdown and depressive psychotic disorders were reported in the media (48) . In the current study, more than half of the participants (55%) reported that this period was stressful for the family as they experienced loneliness and suffered \"more stress and anxiety\" than in the past.",

Furthermore, homeless populations might not have been enumerated in the gram panchayat and Nagar panchayat list and therefore may have been missed from the study. Another limitation with the telephonic method of data collection would have been that participants may be reluctant to speak with an unknown caller, leading to household and participant refusals. It is natural to have a shorter attention span over telephonic interviews than in faceto-face interviews. Therefore, there were few missing data and discontinued interviews in this study.

The COVID-19 public health interventions and behavior change communication strategies should be specifically directed towards the low socio-economic populations through the trusted sources, such as structural interventions to address the poverty and employment policies to address the unemployment crisis. The association between knowledge and practices demonstrates the importance of prompt and accurate public health communication to follow preventive measures optimally.",
