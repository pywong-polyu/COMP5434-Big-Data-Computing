SARS-CoV-2 uses the same receptor as SARS-CoV, ACE2 [7] . The COVID-19 vaccine drive has made marked progress in minimizing hospitalizations and deaths. RNA and DNA vaccines used genetically engineered RNA or DNA that encode a protein, which provides prompt immune response [8] . According to the 'Our World in Data' report, as of 23 December 2021, about 61% of the US population is fully vaccinated in addition to about 11% of the US population that is partially vaccinated against COVID-19 disease [9] . The FDA approved COVID-19 vaccines (Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, and Johnson & Johnson) protect patients against severe illness and hospitalizations due to COVID-19 disease. Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine has an active ingredient, nucleoside-modified mRNA encoding the viral spike (S) glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2. On 23 August 2021, the FDA approved the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine after initial EUA in December 2020. The Moderna COVID-19 vaccine is composed of nucleoside-modified mRNA encoding the viral spike (S) glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 as an active ingredient [10] . Both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines provide a blueprint for the cells by using mRNA, and buildup the body's defense against the virus by allowing the generation of an antibody response which can attack the virus if the vaccinated individual is exposed. Johnson & Johnson's COVID-19 vaccine contains recombinant replication-incompetent adenovirus type 26 vector, that encodes a stabilized variant of the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein as an active ingredient. It triggers an immune response and mimics natural infection; thereby, protecting people against future infections [11] . The FDA approved the first antiviral oral drugs, Paxlovid\u2122 (ritonavir, Pfizer) and Lagevrio Lagevrio (molnupiravir, Merck & Co) for the treatment of mild-to-moderate COVID-19 adults and pediatric patients under an EUA. These drug molecules act as polymerase inhibitors and work against replication of the virus genetic material. In addition, Veklury R (remdesivir, Gilead), an intravenous infusion medication of SARS-CoV-2 nucleotide analog RNA polymerase inhibitor chemically named as 2-ethylbutyl N-{(S)-[2-C-(4-aminopyrrolo[2,1-f ][1,2,4]triazin-7-yl)-2,5-anhydro-d-altrononitril-6-Oyl]phenoxyphosphoryl}-L-alaninate, has been authorized under EUA for COVID-19 treatment. Besides, some drugs and non vaccine biological products, like Evusheld\u2122 (tixagevimab copackaged with cilgavimab, AstraZeneca), Actemra R (tocilizumab, an IL-6 receptor antagonist, Genentech), Xevudy\u2122 (sotrovimab, GlaxoSmithKline plc and Vir Biotechnology, Inc.), bamlanivimab and etesevimab together (for post exposure prophylaxis in subjects who meet high-risk criteria, Lilly), REGEN-COV (casirivimab and imdevimab, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals), and baricitinib (Olumiant, Lilly) were also permitted to use under EUAs.",

Inmazeb\u2122 (Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc.), a mixture of three monoclonal antibodies, namely maftivimab, atoltivimab, and odesivimab-ebgn, is the first FDA approved drug to treat Zaire ebolavirus (EBOV) infection in pediatric and adult patients [12] . This triple antibody combination efficiently neutralizes the virus by blocking the virus entry into host cells. Similarly, Ebanga (Ansuvimab-zykl), is a single-dose intravenous recombinant human IgG1k monoclonal antibody used to treat EBOV infection in children and adults. It prevents the virus from entering into the cells by binding the virus to the glycoprotein 1 subunit of EBOV, preventing the binding of EBOV to host cells.",

Ischemic heart disease, the leading cause of death in the world, is responsible for 16% of the world's total deaths, whereas stroke is the second leading cause of death that is responsible for approximately 11% of total deaths. Hypertension, cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, and severe obesity are the main risk factors for heart disease with varying impacts depending on the age of the individual and the country of origin [13] . In 2021, FDA approved the usage of Kerendia R (finerenone, non steroid mineralocorticoid receptor agonist, Bayer) for the reduction of heart attacks, hospitalization for heart failure and cardiovascular deaths for adults with chronic kidney disease associated with Type 2 diabetes [14] . This drug is demonstrated to be helpful in people with Type 2 diabetes at various stages of kidney disease to improve their heart health. On 20 January 2021, Merck announced that Verquvo R (vericiguat), a soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) stimulator, is approved to mitigate the risk of cardiovascular death and hospitalization by chronic heart failure. Nexletol R (bempedoic acid), is a newly approved drug that efficiently reduces cholesterol synthesis via inhibition of adenosine triphosphate citrate lyase (an enzyme upstream from 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A). This prescription is being used along with a proper diet and other medications to help lower 'bad' cholesterol in the blood (reducing the amount of cholesterol made by the liver), ultimately minimizing the risk of heart disease and lowering the incidence of strokes and heart attacks.",

According to the American Cancer Society, there are about 1,898,160 new cancer cases diagnosed and approximately 608,570 people died from cancer in the US in 2021 [15] . A large number of agents, antibodies and drug-conjugates are being developed for the treatment of various cancers. For example, Cytalux\u2122 (Target Laboratories, Inc.), a fluorescent drug that targets folate receptors, is a new FDA approved drug that is composed of pafolacianine and is used to identify ovarian cancer lesions during surgery in adult patients. On 29 October 2021, Scemblix R (asciminib, Novartis), a kinase inhibitor, was approved to treat Philadelphia chromosome-positive chronic myeloid leukemia. Asciminib has a distinct mechanism of action that binds to the BCR-ABL1 Myristoyl Pocket. Thus, it helps to address resistance in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) previously treated with two or more tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) and overcome mutations at the defective BCR-ABL1 gene. Besides, other kinase inhibitors such as Retevmo R (selpercatinib, Eli Lilly and Company) and Tabrecta R (capmatinib, Novartis) are approved to treat lung, thyroid, and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), respectively.",
