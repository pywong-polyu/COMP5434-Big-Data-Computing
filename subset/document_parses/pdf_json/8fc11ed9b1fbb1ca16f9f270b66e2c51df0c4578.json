It also influences the immune system of the body. The metabolites produced by the gut bacteria control local and other systemic organs' immune functions like the lungs and brain, playing a role in their response to acute and chronic illnesses. Probiotics have shown beneficial effects on lung health. On the contrary, dysbiosis is associated with several diseases, including asthma, chronic bronchitis, emphysema, allergies, and other acute viral infections. By altering the diet of patients with respiratory diseases like patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (COPD), we may be able to mitigate their conditions. This literature review aims to discuss the mechanisms altering the gastrointestinal flora, the pathophysiology of gut and lung axis, the role of diet in gut microbe health, and the association of COPD with gut dysbiosis and peptic ulcer disease (PUD). We have extracted the data from PubMed and Google Scholar, consisting of review articles, case-control studies, and animal studies. The studies showed an association between gut microbes and different lung diseases. It is found that gut dysbiosis not only disrupts intestinal immunity but may also facilitate the development of COPD. Present studies also show an increased seroprevalence of Helicobacter pylori in patients with COPD. The strategies that can improve lung functions, especially in COPD patients, include prebiotics and probiotic supplementation to a diet more balanced than the current average American diet.",

Because of its high prevalence, morbidity, and mortality, it has been a major health problem worldwide [2] . The global burden of COPD is estimated to be 4-5% and is predicted to be the third leading cause of death worldwide [3] . Chronic airway inflammation and constriction of the bronchial tree limit the amount of air entering the alveoli, present in the pathophysiology, and exacerbation of several diseases such as chronic bronchitis, emphysema, asthma, and even cystic fibrosis [1, 4] . In recent studies, it has been implicated that diet and nutrients that affect the gut microbiota and their metabolites (metabolome) influence the mucosal immune system of the lung [5] . It is hypothesized that the 'gut-lung axis' plays a role in regulating inflammation in acute and chronic respiratory diseases, such as COPD [5] .",

            "text": "To regulate the tissue and immune homeostasis the microbiota is in a mutual association with the host executing significant favorable activities for the body, and one of them is the fermentation of dietary components which yields some metabolites [6] . One of the roles of these metabolites is to signal molecules for achieving immune and tissue homeostasis. Among the metabolites, short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) have a small part in regulating the immunomodulatory function, and the role of other metabolites must be assessed [7] . Gut microbiota also defends against pathogens by signaling the immune system's innate and adaptive pathways. Any alteration in the distribution of the gut microbiota due to changes in diet, use of antibiotics, or genetics leads to decreased immune response [6] . This gut dysbiosis is associated with abnormal inflammatory conditions in the airways, including asthma and COPD [6] . Reduced range of gut microbes has been seen in cigarette smokers and is also considered as one of the factors involved in the pathogenesis of COPD [3] . Further, studies have shown that a diet without fiber leads to malnourishment of the microbiota, causing gut dysbiosis and later chronic inflammation both local and systemic [3] . Thus, maintaining the gut microbiota and its metabolites can be an important mechanism to manage patients with lung diseases [6] [7] [8] . Further study of this cross-talk between the gastrointestinal (GI) and pulmonary defense mechanism is essential to understand its effect on lung health, and plan future treatment strategies for managing lung diseases [4] .

One longitudinal study done in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) patients affected with lung disease showed that the microbiota of the mouth could be used as a biomarker of COPD pathogenesis in this population [12] . These conclusions were corroborated in a study by Sun et al. who examined the sputum and feces of patients with acute exacerbation of COPD and found a dynamic relation between the microbiota of the lung and gut axis [1] . Animal studies demonstrated that gut microbiota and a high-fiber diet have some role in the pathogenesis of COPD in the lungs of mice exposed to smoking [5, 13] .

Host immune system regulation and cross-talk by commensal bacteria and their components have been found to occur in animal models by mechanisms such as the production of lysozyme by epithelial barrier Paneth cells, which decreases pathogenic bacteria colonization by NOD2 detecting [26] , and fermentation of food fibers to create SCFAs, which stimulate immune cell secretion of anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-10 and IL-21 [27, 28] .

A study performed to assess the seropositivity of H. pylori on 80 subjects classified into two groups, COPD and non-COPD patients, demonstrated statistically significant results showing that seropositivity was higher in COPD patients than non-COPD patients [34] . Sze MA et al. employed an immunoassay to determine H. pylori IgG antibody titers in serum samples from 4765 individuals with mild-to-moderate COPD. Researchers discovered that H. pylori infection was linked to lower lung function, later systemic inflammation, and an increased risk of cardiovascular death in patients with COPD, suggesting that the bacterium had a negative influence on lung growth [4] . There is a strong indication here that the development of gut dysbiosis is related to the development of gut disease as well as exacerbation of a chronic airway disease such as COPD, with a key factor being inflammation. Looking further into whether the reverse also holds true would doubly illuminate this lung-gut connection and could be extrapolated to devise therapeutic benefit.",

HIV-positive status causes a compromise in the immune system of a patient that ultimately affects the oral microbial flora. Patients with HIV were found to have increased proportions of unusual bacteria such as Veillonella, Streptococcus, and Lactobacillus in their oropharynx. These alterations of oral microbiota were linked with systemic inflammation and the incidence of COPD in the population [12] .

Studies have proven that the Western diet, typically characterized by processed meat/sugar, refined grain, trans-fat, and alcohol, is often nutrient deficient [56, 57] . Regular incorporation of these foods in the diet has been associated with worsening systemic inflammation, chronic cough with expectoration, and progressive airflow obstruction characteristic of COPD in susceptible individuals. It has also been directly associated with increased COPD risk in men and women [33, 58] . In comparison, an inverse relationship has been found to exist between diets rich in fruit/vegetables, whole grains, whole-fat dairy, and including adequate hydration, and the risk of COPD [33, 58] . According to a study by S O Shaheen et al., these are components of what is known as a 'prudent diet' [59] with health benefits.

Factors causing/exacerbating COPD in gut dysbiosis may have similar effects on other respiratory diseases as well. Many of the articles we reviewed in this study were not clinical trials based on human beings. Future implications of the topic in randomized controlled trials will be helpful and more evident. Also, modification of policies and investment at the level of local, state, and federal government would be required to improve availability and access to the 'prudent diet' and fermented foods. However, in the long term, this may very well show a reduction in overall respiratory, GI, and cardiovascular disease burden, currently a regular drain on medical resources. This discussion is beyond the scope of this article at present but provides a promising prospect for further work in the fields of medicine and public health.",

The microbiota of the intestine plays a significant role in lung immune reactions by producing metabolites like SCFAs, and priming immune cells that travel through the lymphatic and circulatory system, acting on the lung mucosa. Thus, disruption of the microbiota in the intestine termed dysbiosis not only affects the intestinal immunity but may also facilitate disease development in the lung. The high plant-based fiber content in the diet and fermented foods have been proven to be beneficial for gut microbiota-metabolite modulation. This may also be beneficial for the prevention and treatment of COPD.",
