Ventilatorassociated pneumonia (VAP) is one of the most commonly seen complications in neonatal patients [1] , and it usually leads to a difficult ventilator weaning, which increases the duration of intensive care unit (ICU) stay [2] . The reported mortality rates among neonatal patients with VAP have been as high as 20-75% in both China and western countries [3] [4] [5] . Although early prediction of VAP could contribute to timely prevention and treatment, no effective predictors of VAP in neonates have been discovered so far [6] . The early diagnosis of VAP in neonates remains a challenge because clinical signs and radiological manifestations are non-specific, and tissue culture as the gold standard of diagnosis is timeconsuming, invasive and easily contaminated.",

Inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-6 (IL-6), C-reactive protein (CRP), and procalcitonin (PCT) have clinical significance as predictive or prognostic markers of infection [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] . Specifically, PCT was shown to be effective for guiding antibiotic treatment [13] . The sensitivity and specificity of PCT for predicting the prognosis of VAP were superior to those of CRP, but both values were found to be effective predictors of the response to antibiotic therapy [8, 14] . The serum IL-6 concentration was shown to be correlated with the severity of VAP but with limited predictive value based on the finding that IL-6 levels in serum and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) did not differ significantly between patients with and without VAP [15] . Although studies of these biomarkers have provided important information regarding their value in VAP, the dynamic changes in the levels of these inflammatory biomarkers in neonates receiving mechanical ventilation (MV) have not been fully discovered and the possibility that a combination of these biomarkers could provide improved diagnostic or prognostic power in VAP has yet to be explored.",

            "text": "VAP is a frequently seen complication in neonates treated with MV, and it is associated with a high morbidity and mortality [2, 18] . Early recognition of VAP permits the timely implementations of treatment strategies [19] , but unfortunately, early diagnosis of VAP is difficult mainly due to the lack of specific early clinical manifestations. The widely used approach of lower respiratory tract tissue culture is easily contaminated and may interfere with the diagnosis [20, 21] . The current study evaluated the predictive value of the serum concentration of sTREM-1, in addition to other conventional biomarkers including PCT, CRP and IL-6, in the early detection of VAP. Our findings revealed that the serum sTREM-1 concentration after 72 h of MV could well predict the occurrence of VAP in neonatal patients, especially when combined with the serum PCT concentration at 72 h of MV. Conversely, the serum concentrations of CRP and IL-6 did not exhibit solid predictive value for VAP in neonates. sTREM-1 was reported to be a biomarker for the severity of infection [22] . In 2000, Bouchon A. et al. showed for the first time that TREM-1, as a member of the novel immunoglobulin super receptor family (Igsuperfamily, Ig-SF), triggers the release of chemokines and pro-inflammatory cytokines [23] . During acute infection, sTREM-1 is highly expressed and sheds from the cell surface into blood, saliva and other secretions. The dynamic blood level of sTREM-1 was shown to be associated with changes of disease severity [22] . In the current study, while the serum sTREM-1 concentrations were elevated in both groups of patients during the first 72 h of MV, patients in the VAP group had remarkably higher levels of sTREM-1 than those in the non-VAP group. MV alone can cause ventilator-associated lung injury (VALI) and enhance the release of multiple inflammatory cytokines. Therefore, it is not surprising that the sTREM-1 level was also increased in the non-VAP group with MV. However, for patients with VAP, systemic infection may contribute to the even higher levels of sTREM-1 that we observed. Gibot et al. found that the increased level of sTREM-1 in septic patients decreased as the condition improved [24] . In the current study, a similar pattern in the serum sTREM-1 concentration was observed.",

Another study evaluating the prognostic value of sTREM-1 in patients with lung diseases claimed that sTREM-1 is a powerful biomarker reflecting clinical outcome [25] . However, a conflicting result was reported by a previous study that assessed the predictive value of sTREM-1 in pediatric patients with VAP and found no difference in serum and bronchoalveolar lavage sTREM-1 concentrations between the VAP and non-VAP groups [26] . There are several possible reasons for the discrepant findings between this previous study and our present study. First, the present study focused on neonates, whereas most previous studies only enrolled pediatric or adult patients. In addition, the underlying diseases could be different in different study populations, which might affect the study results. Also, the serum sTREM-1 concentrations were measured by ELISA in the present study but determined by Western blotting in previous studies [27] . The use of different methods to measure sTREM-1 concentration might contribute to the disparity of the results. Moreover, different types of pathogens might affect the expression of sTREM-1. For example, bacterial and fungal infection can increase the expression of sTREM-1, whereas almost no change in the sTREM-1 level has been observed in cases of viral infection [28] . Finally, the sample size was rather limited in the present study, and further research with a larger sample size is necessary.",

Third, healthy neonates who did not require MV were not included in the study as a control group. Fourth, as we noticed, non-VAP group also had an increased level of sTREM-1 possibly caused by VALI. However, we did not perform bacterial or fungal cultures in non-VAP patients due to the study design. For adults, a previous study found that sTREM-1 was present in a high concentration in the BALF of patients with bacterial VAP. However, the relationship between sTREM-1 level and microbial growth was not evaluated [31] . For neonates, obtaining a BALF specimen without contamination is often clinically infeasible partly because the neonate's airway is delicate. In addition, it's difficult to distinguish colonization from infection [32] . Fifth, the cut-off level of many inflammatory biomarkers may be depended on postnatal age. In addition, different measurement may also affect the cutoff level. However, due to the limited sample size, we did not further analyze the sTERM-1 level in patients with different postnatal age.
