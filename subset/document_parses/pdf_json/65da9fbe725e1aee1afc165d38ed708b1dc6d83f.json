Currently used methods of repair have high recurrence rates and considerable risk for complications.

Patients with a symptomatic parastomal hernia will be included and followed up at 3, 12 and 36 months, with surgical complication as the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes will be recurrence rate and health-related quality of life assessed with VHPQ, EORTC C30 and CR29. Tissue biology and collagen metabolism will be investigated pre-and postoperatively using biopsies of the abdominal wall fascia and blood samples. Discussion: Parastomal hernia constitutes a major clinical problem where the prospects of a good result after hernia repair are presently poor. This new method of repair with full-thickness skin grafting could be a new alternative in our surgical toolbox, but before then, it must be evaluated properly.",

Symptoms from a parastomal hernia range from asymptomatic to problems significantly impairing the patient's quality of life, even life-threatening due to strangulation of the hernia content.

The European Hernia Society guidelines on prevention and treatment of parastomal hernia provide predominantly weak evidence for both the epidemiological aspects of the disease and its subsequent treatment [16] . Since there is a general lack of studies comparing different techniques for parastomal hernia repair, there is no consensus on what the best method available is. This makes the design of a trial, and in particular, choosing a comparator to evaluate a novel treatment, difficult and even controversial. Our choice of using reinforcement with DynaMesh\u00ae-IPST as a comparator was made because of its similarity to our FTSG-method and with the background of recurrence rates in the vicinity of other IPOM methods [22] . Furthermore, recurrence of a parastomal hernia after surgical repair is of minor importance compared to the serious and sometimes fatal complications of repair methods using synthetic mesh as reinforcement. The primary goal of benign surgery must be the safety of the patients, which the primary outcome of this trial.",
