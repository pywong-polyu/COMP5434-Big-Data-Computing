            "text": "Host cell DNA methylation analysis in urine provides promising triage markers for women diagnosed with a high-risk (HR) human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. In this study, we have investigated a panel of six host cell methylation markers (GHSR, SST, ZIC1, ASCL1, LHX8, ST6GALNAC5) in cervicovaginal secretions collected within the first part of the urine void (FVU) from a referral population. Cytology, histology, and HPV DNA genotyping results on paired FVU and cervical samples were available. Urinary median methylation levels from HR-HPV (n = 93) positive women were found to increase for all markers with severity of underlying disease. Significantly elevated levels were observed for GHSR and LHX8 in relation to high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN2 +; n = 33), with area under de curve values of 0.80 (95% Confidence Interval (CI) 0.59-0.92) and 0.76 (95% CI 0.58-0.89), respectively. These findings are the first to support the assertion that methylation analysis of host cell genes is feasible in FVU and holds promise as molecular, triage strategy to discern low-from high-grade cervical disease in HR-HPV positive women. Molecular testing on FVU may serve to increase cervical cancer screening attendance in hard-to-reach populations whilst reducing loss to follow-up and await further optimization and validation studies.",

Though population based approaches such as sending personal invitation letters and reminders for a scheduled appointment have proven to be effective in increasing participation rates, barriers for attending cervical cancer screening have persevered 1 . These barriers can be diverse, including practical, emotional, and cognitive barriers 2 . Self-sampling could overcome part of these issues 3 and HPV testing of self-collected cervicovaginal samples (SS) has shown similar accuracy compared to clinician-collected cervical samples (CS) using a validated PCR-based method 3,4 . Notwithstanding that SS are well-accepted by women, highest preference is given to urine self-sampling 5-10 . In recent trials, good HR-HPV DNA agreement and clinical sensitivity has been reported in first-void urine (FVU) compared to CS 6-8,11-15 . FVU allows for self-collection of cervicovaginal secretions that accumulate between the small labia and around the urethra opening, and are captured within the first part of the urine void. It is often mistaken for the first urine of the day (morning urine), which-in contrast to FVU-does not improve urinary HPV detection 6,7,16 .",

            "text": "www.nature.com/scientificreports/ Based on the same concept behind identifying more human and HPV DNA in FVU than in subsequent fractions [17] [18] [19] , FVU may also harbour other biomarkers. The use of urine to detect biomarkers for cervical screening has been receiving close appraisal in the last decade (previously reviewed 20 ) . Similar to the limitations of SS, FVU will likely not fulfil the high-quality cellularity standards required for morphological biomarkers such as cytology. Molecular biomarkers on the other hand have the potential to overcome this issue and are likely to yield high-throughput, objective, and reproducible results. Host cell methylation markers have shown promise as they are able to distinguish low-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) with productive HR-HPV infections from high-grade CIN with transforming HR-HPV infections, especially those with a high short-term risk of progression to cancer, and detect all carcinomas 21, 22 . Their clinical value to discern HR-HPV infected women with clinically relevant disease has been validated in CS [23] [24] [25] [26] and SS [27] [28] [29] [30] . More recently, methylation of host cell genes in urine has shown promise as biomarker as well [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] . Combining primary HPV detection, and in case HR-HPV positive methylation marker triage on the same FVU sample could pose a non-invasive strategy to identify HR-HPV women with clinically relevant cervical disease in need of referral. Such strategy may be especially interesting in hard-to-reach populations where an approach based on clinician-collected samples is not effective, as well as in light of pandemics such as the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic where access to healthcare is hampered and home-based self-sampling could aid prevention initiatives.",

These markers were previously identified by unbiased genome-wide methylation analysis in HR-HPV transformed cell lines/tissue biopsies (GHSR, SST, ZIC1) 26 and SS (ASCL1, LHX8, and ST6GALNAC5) 29 and validated as triage markers for HR-HPV positive women.

All six methylation markers showed an increase in median methylation levels in FVU for underlying disease (HSIL + and CIN2 +). Four out of six markers showed a gradual increase in median methylation levels with increasing lesion severity (normal/CIN0 through CIN3). The rise in methylation levels with increasing lesion severity was predominantly pronounced for GHSR, LHX8 and SST, where significant increases were observed using CIN2 + /CIN3, CIN2 +, and HSIL + as endpoint, respectively. The less pronounced difference between median methylation levels between normal/low-grade and highgrade cervical disease in FVU compared to CS/SS 26, 29 can be explained by several factors. Firstly, the investigated host cell genes, GHSR, SST, ZIC1, ASCL1, LHX8, and ST6GALNAC5 were identified and validated in clinician and self-collected cervicovaginal samples. As the clinical value of methylation markers is not necessarily analogous between sample types 43 , a similar comprehensive approach including genome-wide DNA methylation profiling of FVU samples from HR-HPV positive women with normal to high-grade cervical disease and (invasive) cancer might allow us to identify methylated genes that predict high-grade cervical disease more accurately in FVU. Nevertheless, as we are using the first part of the urine void as liquid biopsy to capture cervicovaginal secretions, similarities in biomarker profile are expected. Secondly, CIN2 and CIN3 are a heterogeneous group of disease of which only a subset has a high risk of progression to cancer. Previous research has indicated that high methylation levels are associated with an advanced stage of disease and presumable high cancer progression risk. On the We have no data on the duration and cancer risk of the CIN2 and CIN3 included in present study. Others have investigated difference in host cell methylation levels in urine between cancers and controls, for which larger differentiations between groups are anticipated. One study reported increasing number of hyper methylation-positive urine samples (for \u2265 1/4 genes: DAPK1, RARB, TWIST, CDH13) according to lesion severity (4% CIN0/1, 28% CIN2/3/carcinoma in situ, and 62% invasive cervix carcinoma) 32 . Significant different methylation levels between cancers and controls in (first-void) urine have also been described for ASCL1, FAM19A4, GHSR, LHX8, PHACTR3, PRDM14, SFRP4, SST, and ZIC1 31, 34, 35 . An estimate of the diagnostic performance of the markers in our study showed similar AUC's as those reported by van den Helder and colleagues (2020) 35 , between 0.62-0.80 and 0.56-0.77 to discriminate between CIN0/1 and CIN2 + and CIN0-2 and CIN3, respectively. Highest AUC's were observed when comparing cancers versus controls. It is therefore of interest to investigate the discriminatory power of our methylation marker panel in FVU from cancer patients in future studies.",

            "text": "Furthermore, the controls used in this study to assess biomarker performance were all HR-HPV positive (w/o low-grade underlying cervical disease), which is different from other studies reporting on triage marker www.nature.com/scientificreports/ performance between (pre)cancers and controls with partial HR-HPV positivity 31 or without any disease 34, 35 . Smaller differences in methylation levels between cases and controls can thus be expected from our data set. However, as methylation marker(s) (panels) are proposed as a triage strategy to discern high grade disease in women with a positive HR-HPV test, we believe that the controls used in this study align well with the intended clinical use, empowering the results. Limitations of our study need to be acknowledged, and firstly involve the relative small sample size, potentially contributing to the insignificant differences observed, and heterogeneous character of our study population. This study was designed to identify promising triage markers for HR-HPV positive women. Hereto, a referral population of women was targeted attending colposcopy, either because of first abnormal screen result, or for follow-up www.nature.com/scientificreports/ of a persistent infection and/or associated lesion. Histology outcomes from biopsies (only taken when indicated) and cervical conization were only available for one third of the study population. To overcome this, performance of the markers was also assessed based on cytology, notwithstanding that histology is the golden standard reference test. Including both endpoints was reinforced by good \u03ba-agreements observed between cytology (HSIL +) and histology CIN2 + (\u03ba: 0.60 (95% CI 0.35-0.86)) and CIN3 (\u03ba: 0.68 (95% CI 0.42-0.94)) endpoints. The difference between methylation markers showing significance in cytology (i.e. SST) versus histology endpoints (i.e. GHSR and LHX8) is likely a reflection of the suboptimal performance of cytology to predict underlying disease and the relatively small sample size. For this reason and given the nature of the study being a feasibility study we did not investigate diagnostic performance of methylation marker combinations. Secondly, at the time of study initiation limited optimization experiments had been performed identifying the optimal FVU collection and preanalytical processing method preceding methylation analysis by qMSP. Optimizations might potentially increase analytic sensitivity, and consequently distinctions between cases and controls and AUC's. Yet, it is expected that In summary, the data from this study propose that methylation analysis of host cell genes in FVU has the diagnostic potential to distinguish normal/low-grade from high-grade underlying cervical disease in HR-HPV infected women. Concomitantly, it is a promising liquid biopsy to offer a fully molecular screen and triage strategy based on primary HPV testing and methylation marker detection in the same sample. Its non-invasive nature, being well-accepted, and ability to be self-collected at home furthermore fortifies its use to potentially increase screening-attendance in hard-to-reach populations whilst reducing loss to follow-up. Further studies including a larger sample series with histological confirmation of underlying disease are ongoing to define the diagnostic accuracy of methylation marker testing in FVU and to extract the most discriminative methylation markers or marker combinations.",
