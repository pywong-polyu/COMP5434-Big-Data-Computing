The development of a hydrosoluble form of ibuprofen can be a strategy to reach a high concentration in the lungs by using modern inhalation devices. Therefore, the development of an inhalable formulation with high bioavailability in the lungs was the leitmotiv of our investigation. The hypertonic ibuprofen solution to be nebulized (NIH) presents great relevant characteristics: bactericidal, virucidal, mucolytic and has a known anti-inflammatory property. Bactericidal and virucidal effects are related to the physico-chemical properties of Na-ibuprofenate as an amphipathic molecule. It has the capability to insert into the bilayer membranes destabilizing the structure, altering its biological properties and avoiding the duplication or infection. Our preliminary results indicate that the presence of this high ionic strength solution reduces 10 times the amount of ibuprofen necessary to kill bacteria, but also the time to kill 1x10 6 bacteria, from 4 hours (in its absence) to only three minutes (in its presence). That was observed using Pseudomona aeruginosa, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Burkholderia cepacia. Also, \"in vitro'' ibuprofen demonstrated virucidal activity against the so-called enveloped virus, a family that includes coronavirus strain (2019-nCoV).

The development of a hydrosoluble form of ibuprofen can be a strategy to reach a high concentration in the lungs by using modern inhalation devices, without the potential systemic effects of high dosages. This approach would allow us to deliver micro or nanometer sized particles to reach a large surface area, such as the pulmonary alveolar. The other benefit of this size is that particles from 0.5 to 3 \u00b5m are captured by macrophages through phagocytosis, but not those < 0.25 \u00b5m (1).

{"text": "studied Ibuprofen's ability to limit lung damage induced by Pseudomonas infection in rats. This early report was the cornerstone to investigate ibuprofen in lung diseases but focus on the anti-inflammatory properties. Later, preclinical and clinical studies demonstrated the beneficial effect of high dose of ibuprofen. In 1995, Michael W. Konstan et al. (2), showed that high doses of ibuprofen in oral form, decreased the progression of lung disease in patients with cystic fibrosis and mild lung disease. Consequently, Lands et al. (17) investigated the safety and efficacy of oral high-dose ibuprofen in children with CF in a randomized, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial along 2 years. This study demonstrated that a slowdown in the predicted impaired vital capacity was observed in patients on high-dose ibuprofen. Collectively, these clinical trials document the benefits and relative safety of long-term use of high-dose ibuprofen in pediatric CF patients by attributing these benefits to the modulating properties of neutrophils (17). At the same time Elvers K.T. et al. (18) evaluated the effect of ibuprofen on the \"in vitro\" growth of six bacterial strains, and observed that ibuprofen inhibited the growth of Gram-positive species.\u00bfBut how ibuprofen has an antibacterial activity? The bactericidal and virucidal effects are related to the physico-chemical properties of Na-ibuprofenate as an amphipathic molecule. It has the capability to insert into the bilayer membranes destabilizing the structure, altering its biological properties and avoiding the duplication or infection of bacterias or viruses.", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "TABREF0": {"text": "Effect of Na-Ibuprofenate on the vitro infective capacity of HSV, BVDV, VSV and MV:", "latex": null, "type": "table", "html": "<html><body><table><tr><td>Virus </td><td>Virus Characteristics </td><td>Infective capacity title after Ibuprofen treatment\n</td></tr><tr><td>Family </td><td>Genome </td><td>Size (nM) </td><td>TCID mL-l\n</td></tr><tr><td>HSV </td><td>Herpes </td><td>dsDNA </td><td>120-200 </td><td>&gt;6.9\n</td></tr><tr><td>BVDV </td><td>Flavi </td><td>ssRNA </td><td>50-70 </td><td>&gt;6.5\n</td></tr><tr><td>VSV </td><td>Rhabdo </td><td>ssRNA </td><td>70-170 </td><td>&gt;7.7\n</td></tr><tr><td>MV </td><td>Paramyxo </td><td>ssRNA </td><td>150-300 </td><td>&gt;5.0\n</td></tr></table></body></html>"}, "TABREF1": {"text": "Table 2: NIHM decreases reactive oxygen species (ROS) in human (expressed as \u039bU), * = p < 0.05.", "latex": null, "type": "table", "html": "<html><body><table><tr><td>Patient </td><td>ROS Pre-NIHM </td><td>ROS Pro-NIHM\n</td></tr><tr><td>85314 </td><td>2019 </td><td>353\n</td></tr><tr><td>85315 </td><td>698 </td><td>329\n</td></tr><tr><td>85320 </td><td>1035 </td><td>513\n</td></tr><tr><td>85315b </td><td>762 </td><td>583\n</td></tr><tr><td>85314b </td><td>703 </td><td>426\n</td></tr><tr><td>85321 </td><td>1577 </td><td>887\n</td></tr><tr><td>Mean </td><td>1043 </td><td>441*\n</td></tr><tr><td>STD </td><td>252 </td><td>48\n</td></tr></table></body></html>"}}, "back_matter": [{"text": "This paper represents a collaborative effort among members of C\u00f3rdoba Center for Products and Processes (CEPROCOR), the National Council for Scientific and Technical Research (CONICET) and the private pharmaceutical company Luar Chemistry (Qu\u00edmica Luar \u00ae).
