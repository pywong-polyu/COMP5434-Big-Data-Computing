            "text": "BACKGROUND: With the increasing focus on prevention of Alzheimer's disease, there is need for characterization of preclinical populations. Local participant registries offer an opportunity to facilitate research engagement via remote data collection, inform recruitment, and characterize preclinical samples, including individuals with subjective cognitive decline. OBJECTIVES: We sought to characterize subjective cognitive decline in a registry sample, as related to psychiatric history and related variables, including personality and loneliness, quality of life, and factors related to dementia risk (e.g., family history of dementia). DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS: Participants were 366 individuals (mean age=67.2 (range 50-88), 65% female, 94% white, 97% non-Hispanic or Latino, 82% with at least a bachelor's degree) with no reported history of mild cognitive impairment or dementia. All participants had expressed interest in research, primarily via community outreach events and prior research involvement. Data was collected via electronic surveys, distributed using REDCap. Electronic questionnaires included questions on demographic variables, subjective cognitive decline, quality of life, loneliness, and personality. RESULTS: There was a high prevalence of risk factors for dementia in the registry sample (68% with family history of dementia, 31% with subjective cognitive decline). Subjective cognitive decline was more common in women and associated with history of depression, but not with family history of dementia. Subjective cognitive decline was also associated with lower conscientiousness and lower emotional stability, as well as higher loneliness and lower quality of life. Among participants who endorsed a psychiatric history, most reported onset more than 10 years prior, rather than within the last 10 years. CONCLUSIONS: Subjective cognitive decline in a registry sample may be more strongly associated with longstanding psychiatric and personality variables, rather than family history of dementia, adding to the literature on characterization of subjective cognitive decline across different settings. These findings highlight the acceptability of remote data collection and the potential of registries to inform recruitment by characterizing registrants, which may help to stratify dementia risk and match participants to eligible trials.",

As researchers in the field of AD and related dementias continue to search for disease-modifying treatments, there is increasing focus on prevention of AD and characterization of preclinical populations. Enrollment in AD trials is more critical now than ever, yet there remain significant challenges to recruitment (2) (3) (4) , including lack of awareness about research opportunities, location/distance, study partner requirements, concern about study risks, and cultural barriers (4-7).",

SCD is defined as self-reported concern of persistent cognitive changes within the past 1-3 years, in the absence of objective impairment on standardized cognitive testing (12) (13) (14) . SCD is predictive of further cognitive decline among cognitively normal older adults (13, 15, 16) , with SCD in combination with amyloid pathology conferring the greatest risk (17, 18) . That said, SCD is nonspecific and is associated with affective symptoms in older adults, including depression and anxiety (19, 20) , and select personality traits, such as neuroticism, that may moderate observed associations between SCD and underlying amyloid pathology (21) . Affective symptoms and SCD are both associated with increased risk of cognitive decline (22) , with comorbid SCD and anxiety being associated with greater risk of progression to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or dementia, in comparison to those endorsing only SCD or only anxiety, respectively (23) . Relatedly, it is important to consider the settings in which SCD is assessed; for example, SCD within a memory clinic setting has been associated with higher dementia risk relative to community samples (24) .",

SCD was more common in women and associated with history of depression, higher loneliness, and lower quality of life. Of those who reported a psychiatric history, most reported onset of depressive or anxiety symptoms more than 10 years prior. Further, lower conscientiousness and lower emotional stability on personality measures were associated with greater SCD. Together, these results may suggest that SCD within a registry sample, recruited primarily from community outreach events and prior research settings, may be more strongly related to longstanding psychiatric and personality variables, rather than family history of dementia. This finding was observed among highly-educated registrants at risk of developing dementia and interested in research, who may be well-versed and sensitive to cognitive changes but may not yet have presented to a memory clinic. It is also worth noting that mood and personality factors could certainly bias one's perception of cognitive abilities (and vice-versa). These findings add to the existing literature on SCD across different samples and highlight the importance of study setting. Prior work found that older adults with SCD from a memory clinic were at a higher risk of developing MCI compared to adults with SCD in the general population (32) .",

Another recruitment strategy for preclinical and/or biomarker studies may be to screen registrants at the highest risk for future cognitive decline, such as 1) individuals with SCD and family history of AD dementia or 2) females endorsing SCD, and possibly also by obtaining informant report among those with SCD to further characterize risk (34, 35) .",

First, our data consisted of only selfreport measures, including self-reported psychiatric and neurologic history, which may be susceptible to information bias. That said, self-report of psychiatric symptoms is likely reliable among adults without MCI or dementia; participants may also have felt more comfortable disclosing psychiatric history via remote, self-report questionnaires rather than direct questioning by study staff in the clinic. Even so, the cross-sectional design precludes any discussion of directional or causal relationships between SCD and psychiatric history, loneliness, and personality. Next, our sample lacked objective cognitive data, which is relevant to the definition of SCD. Any participants with a self-reported history of MCI or dementia were excluded, but without current cognitive data, there is the possibility that some participants may have objective cognitive impairment despite never having received an MCI or dementia diagnosis. In addition, our registry sample lacked AD biomarker or genetic data on participants. Future research cohorts could consider including these variables to further characterize dementia risk among those with SCD. Longitudinal studies with objective and clinicianadministered assessments are also warranted to better elucidate the nature and direction of associations between SCD and psychiatric history, loneliness, and personality.",

The findings may also be biased towards those who had access to technology and prior experience completing remote assessments via smartphone, tablet, or computer. Future registry studies focused on remote data collection may need to consider modifications to optimize response rate (e.g., training in use of technology at outreach events, individualized assistance in technology set-up, psychoeducation regarding encrypted vs. unencrypted email formats, etc.). There was also minimal diversity in our registry, most notably in terms of race, ethnicity, and educational history. It will be crucial for future work to develop targeted strategies to engage more diverse samples in registries, particularly given that minority populations may be at an elevated risk for developing AD and related dementias (36) . The prevalence of SCD has also been shown to vary across racial and ethnic groups (37), a finding which could be explored further in more diverse registry samples. To do so, it will be critical to explore any barriers to either registry enrollment and/or research participation among minority populations, perhaps via active community outreach (38) .",

Future work should also consider exploring participants' expectations of a registry to further optimize registry design and practices (8) , possibly to include providing feedback to registrants about study results. In addition, local, and predominantly online/remote, registries have the potential to streamline recruitment and allow for objective examination of recruitment success, or alternatively, lack of success and exploration of barriers to research engagement. In addition, registries may allow for remote data collection to pilot new studies and/or better characterize registry samples, with regard to demographic and psychiatric variables, as well as AD risk factors. In summary, local registries can inform recruitment by characterizing registrants, stratifying their risk for future cognitive decline, and then matching them to studies for which they may be eligible. Furthermore, registries provide an opportunity to enhance research engagement, ranging from remote data collection, as demonstrated here, to participation in observational studies and ultimately, clinical trial enrollment.",
