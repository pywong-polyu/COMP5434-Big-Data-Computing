Thus, it is important for those in product development, research, and public policy to understand how the public's perception of AI is shaped. In this study, we conducted focus groups and an online survey to determine the knowledge of AI held by the American public, and to judge whether entertainment media is a major influence on how Americans perceive AI. What we found is that the American public's knowledge of AI is patchy: some have a good understanding of what is and what is not AI, but many do not. When it came to understanding what AI can do, most respondents believe that AI could \"replace human jobs\" but few thought that it could \"feel emotion.\" Most respondents were optimistic about the future and impact of AI, though about one third were not sure. Most respondents also did not think they could develop an emotional bond with or be comfortable being provided care by an AI. Regarding the influence of entertainment media on perceptions of AI, we found a significant relationship (p < 0.5) between people's beliefs about AI in entertainment media and their beliefs about AI in reality. Those who believe AI is realistically depicted in entertainment media were more likely to see AIs as potential emotional partners or apocalyptic robots than to imagine AIs taking over jobs or operating as surveillance tools.",

            "text": "While analysts of AI and society generally presume that feedback loops connect AI science with the representation of AI in popular culture, describing those loops in detail would be a difficult project in cultural studies and the cultural studies of science. The present study attempts to map just one segment of the relationship between actual AI and its representation, by determining what ideas of AI are held by the American general public, and to what extent those ideas are shaped by the entertainment and informational aspects of the media. In particular, by canvassing the relationship between the portrayal of AI in entertainment media and the general public's attitudes toward AI, we lay a foundation for assessing how these media shape public beliefs and attitudes. Such an assessment should in turn help public interest technologists who seek to design and deploy AI to better craft their outreach to the general public on behalf of which AI is presumably being developed. (Kirby 2010; Menadue and Jacups 2018; Parikka 2019; Jordan et al. 2016.) The goal of this paper is, thus, to look at how people perceive AI through entertainment media and to see whether portrayals of AI in film, television and video games play a role in shaping people's beliefs about AI. For the purposes of this study we concentrate on film, television, and video game representations, which, while they overlap with or otherwise interrelate with fiction, both in print and online, have come to dominate public entertainment. We are aware of emergent forms of digital storytelling (such as those described in Burgess 2006 ) but considered their effects to not be yet so prevalent, and thus to be outside the scope of our study. Our research team conducted focus groups and an online survey to determine the knowledge of AI held by Americans generally, and to judge whether entertainment media is a major influence on their perceptions of it. We will end with some thoughts about the potential implication for our research on policy and design.",

            "text": "Several general surveys by both stakeholders and academics of the public perception of AI have shown that people, in the United States and the United Kingdom, have a broad but shallow understanding of the technology (Dafoe and Zhang 2019; Edelman AI Center of Expertise 2019; Hervieux and Wheatley 2021; GoodAI 2019; Stai et al. 2020 ). Respondents show a general understanding of what AI is, but no real understanding of how AI is used or how it works. For example, a survey by the Edelman AI Center of Expertise shows that 63% of the American general public know that robots use AI but only 38% believe that computer vision uses AI, and only 37% believe that natural language processing uses AI (Edelman AI Center of Expertise 2019). So, while those respondents were able to associate robots with the general usage of AI, they could not identify as such an actual AI technology that allows robots to function. In another survey, a majority of respondents indicated that AI is used in virtual assistants, smart speakers and driverless cars, but did not believe that Facebook photo tagging, Google Search, Netflix or Amazon recommendations use AI (Dafoe and Zhang 2019) , showing that people are less likely to detect AI algorithms when they work in the background. Similarly, respondents indicated that criminal justice biases due to AI were not likely to be a problem within 10 years, even though those biases exist now and have only just begun to be investigated (Dafoe and Zhang 2019) . In another survey, 23% of respondents indicated that they never used AI. This is surprising considering the population of the survey consisted of professional librarians. A more plausible conclusion is that a large majority of those people were not able to identify which technologies in their everyday life rely on AI (Hervieux and Wheatley 2021) .",

That people harbor such fears is not to say that the public does not simultaneously believe that AI will lead to improvements in our everyday lives: in one survey, \"respondents thought Al would start having a positive effect on humankind in four years (4.32) and a negative effect in five years (4.74)\" (Holder et al. 2018) . Again, such results show that the public does not believe that AI is widely used and deployed today but thinks it will be in the future. The public also predicts a 54% likelihood that high-level machine intelligence will be created within 10 years (\"machines that are able to perform almost all tasks that are economically relevant today better than the median human (today) at each task\") but also that those machines will cause more harm than good (Dafoe and Zhang 2019) . Less dramatic scenarios are also brought up: data privacy, cyberattacks, surveillance and digital manipulation are recurring concerns in several general surveys (Gao et al. 2020; GoodAI 2019; Dafoe and Zhang 2019) . Finally, some respondents bring up concerns that are not inherent to AI but result from social inequalities. For example, in one survey, most respondents report believing that AI will benefit the wealthy and harm the poor (Edelman AI Center of Expertise 2019).",

This might be because AI has the potential to dramatically change certain professions, or because AI development is understood to be directly motivated by economic interests. Dr. Mark Cotteleer, research director of Deloitte's Center for Integrated Research, explains that if \"we want to use technology growth as a means to drive economic growth, we need to think about what the people on the ground being asked to use these technologies are going to think about it\" (Robinson 2019) . Much of the research on the public perception of AI has focused on specific professional fields, such as healthcare workers and librarians. Because AI has different implications for different professions, attitudes across disciplines vary considerably. For example, physicians believe that AI achievements are exaggerated in the media (La\u00ef et al. 2020) . This sense of exaggeration would explain why 88% of respondents in a general survey believe that there is autonomous robotic surgery in the United States, even though current robotic surgery requires the presence and intervention of a surgeon (Stai et al. 2020) . Physicians also report that the technological developments that are meant to assist them in their jobs are too focused on innovation instead of utility (La\u00ef et al. 2020) . Despite mainstream attention to AI replacing certain professions, librarians in general have very little fear that AI will replace their jobs. They see the role of AI as being limited to certain tasks such as improving library search, cataloging and reference service (Lund et al. 2020; Hervieux and Wheatley 2021) .",

Such qualitative analyses are especially important for tracking how highly publicized developments in AI can alter its public perception (Beauchamp 2018 ). An analysis of New York Times articles over a 30-year period shows that major events and developments throughout the years are reflected in news trends. AI has been associated with many different technologies and activities across the decades: from space weapons in 1986, science fiction in the 1990s, and chess in 1996 to search engines in 2006 and driverless vehicles in 2016 (Fast and Horvitz 2017) . Moreover, social media engagement around AI doubles and sometimes triples when major events are brought to the public's attention, such as when AlphaGo defeated Ke Jie in 2017, the number one Go player at the time (Gao et al. 2020) .",

There is some evidence that viewers' beliefs about certain social groups or social issues can be altered when presented with fictional narratives on television or in popular culture (Green and Brock 2000; Slater and Rouner 2002; Murphy et al. 2011) , especially when fiction is the primary and sometimes only source of information that is available to us about certain issues. For instance, for many Americans, television is their main source of second-hand information about healthcare and diseases (Murphy et al. 2008) . Entertainment can transport and persuade viewers by presenting them with characters they can identify with and narratives that are engaging (Riley et al. 2021) . Such entertainment media storytelling persuades by presenting visceral experiences with which audiences identify. Unfortunately, however, since the entertainment media often values profits over accuracy, many such narratives have skewed perspectives on reality, and individuals who consume large amounts of entertainment media can internalize these skewed narratives (Dahlstrom 2014) . While viewers often challenge the messages that they find in fiction, viewers that are more immersed in the story are more likely to form beliefs that are consistent with the narrative and have more positive evaluations of the protagonist (Green and Brock 2000) . Hence the importance of creating fiction and television with realistic portrayals of certain topics. For example, fiction writers should provide accurate portrayals of health issues such as COVID-19 and HIV so that viewers are not misled into wrong beliefs about risk and transmission (Johnson 2013; Riley et al. 2021) .",

The relationship between media producers and their audience is complex. For a piece of media to successfully convey a message to an audience, audiences need to be receptive to the message, able to decode it, and operating within the same framework as the producers (Hall 1980) . Additionally, many questions can disrupt the model of media-consumer effect since it is not clear what is producing the effect (one movie? one genre? or movies in general?) and what the nature of the effect is (a belief? an attitude?)

As previous research shows, many people today still associate AI with science fiction and with fictionality in general (Cave et al. 2018; Fast and Horvitz 2017) . Creators of science fiction intentionally write stories that bring out the potential of future technologies to help audiences conceptualize and understand the impact they could have on society (Kirby 2010) . Those representations of AI in science fiction can motivate more positive attitudes towards, more acceptance of, and more ambition for real scientific research (Fleischmann and Templeton 2008, Menadue and Jacups 2018) . So, while calls to realism are appropriate for issues of public health, it seems inadequate to ask for realistic portrayals of AI since it is so often associated with forward-looking and reality-bending genres. To understand public perceptions of AI, it is not only crucial to understand how the media portrays AI in fictional stories but also how the public perceives the portrayal of AI in the media. Movies and popular culture might be their only exposure to what they perceive AI to be and might, thus, have a high influence on their beliefs and perception of real AI. Analyses of trends in current media show that there is a tendency to embody AI characters in fiction, and specifically to gender them as either male or female. Such stories also focus on either utopian or dystopian extremes, ranging from fulfilling all human desires and freeing humans from labor to enslaving or destroying humanity (Cave et al. 2018 ). Since public perception can influence the future of AI development (Beauchamp 2018) , it is also important to understand how AI is portrayed in such works of popular culture.",

The first two categories should be familiar to some readers since many similar studies look at the public's understanding of AI and their hopes and worries about future technologies. The second two are less common but are inherently enmeshed with representations of AI in the media. Since AI is often represented as the subject and object of emotional connections (with other characters in the fiction or with the audience itself), we thought it was important to highlight survey results concerning such connections. Likewise, we were interested in how AI is gendered in the media through embodied and disembodied means (as when, for example, Wall-e and Eve are perceived as gendered without having a human-like voice or an anthropomorphic body). Since those aspects of AI are tied together, we grouped the results of our questions about them in a separate category.",

However, few significant results came out of this.

However, those who report getting their information from entertainment sources were just as likely (1.39 times) to have that same belief (p < 0.000). The same was true about other beliefs about AI's potential: those who report getting their information from the news were 1.57 times more likely (p < 0.000) to believe that AI could run surveillance on us, and those who reported getting their information from entertainment media were 1.39 times more likely (p = 0.004) to believe it. There was no significant relationship between reporting getting information about AI from entertainment industry and the belief that AI could take over the world: in other words, people who claim to receive their information about AI from entertainment are just as likely to believe that AI can take over the world as those who claim to get their information from other sources. And so, we found that whether people get information from the news or from entertainment media did not affect their beliefs about AI, assuming accurate self-reporting.

            "text": "We have found that people are usually more optimistic than pessimistic about the future of AI, not only in their responses to direct questions about their attitudes but also in the ways that they think about AI. For example, our respondents were more likely to think of a positive term (intelligent, useful, effective, etc.) than a negative term (evil, corrupt, scary, etc.) when asked to describe AI in a word. Significant patterns often existed between respondent answers to survey questions and respondent demographics. Typically, respondents who were male, younger, more educated, or who live in a more populated area believed they knew more about AI and had more positive feelings about AI. Meanwhile, respondents who were female, older, less educated or lived in more rural areas were most anxious about AI (i.e., they stated that they were pessimistic about its future and indicated that they worried that AI will replace human jobs) and were also less likely to state that they know what AI is, and less likely to have used AI. And so, we see a link between our respondents' degree of technical familiarity with AI and their attitudes about the future and impact of AI. After all, familiarity with and knowledge of different AI technology allows users to create their own understanding of what AI is and what it is capable of. Fast and Horvitz (2017) show that this general optimism is also reflected in news coverage about AI: news about AI is moving away from \"space weapons\" and \"science fiction\" towards technologies that the public might interact with like \"search engines\" and \"driverless cars.\" And so, one possible explanation is that exposure to real AI technologies in daily life removes the mystery and myths behind a concept that sometimes seems opaque. That said, as an anonymous referee points out, we should be careful not to dismiss the possibility of some respondents having a deep understanding of the societal implications of AI without necessarily having a good technical understanding of it or without incorporating those technologies in their everyday life. It is likely that our framing bias led to our equating understanding of AI with a technical understanding. But, as our discussion of entertainment media will show, this should not be the only way we measure understanding, and we have been able to discern instances where respondents without technical expertise did demonstrate significant knowledge about AI's real or potential social effects.",

Although there is very little evidence to believe that AI, especially currently available AI, is capable of feeling emotions, men are much more likely to indicate that they could develop an emotional relationship with AI and that AI is capable of feeling emotions. One focus group participant noted that when AI is sexualized and romanticized in movies; it is usually presented as female. When male AI is presented as a companion, it is not sexualized in the same way, but rather is typically aggressive in nature, such as in the Terminator franchise. Many narratives in entertainment media about relationships between humans and AI seem to focus on human males developing feelings for female AIs, as in Her or Ex Machina. And so, we have one example in which entertainment media seems to be quite influential on people's (in our case, men's) beliefs about AIs' capacity for feeling emotions, even when there is no serious empirical backing for AIs feeling emotions like humans do. This gives us reason to believe that entertainment media can possibly be the source of beliefs about AI. In other words, people use AI in fiction to learn about what AI is capable of doing in reality. We explore this possibility in the next section.",

            "text": "Prior research demonstrates that entertainment media can sometimes shape people's beliefs, when audiences are receptive to the messaging of fiction writers (Green and Brock 2000; Murphy et al. 2011; Slater and Rouner 2002) . This is especially relevant when entertainment media is the only available source of information about a certain issue (Murphy et al. 2011) . If this is true, entertainment about AI could shape people's beliefs about AI. Cave et al. also show that narratives about AI usually focus on extremes: \"fulfilling all human desires and freeing humans from labor or enslaving or destroying humanity\" (Cave et al. 2018) . It is then worth investigating whether people's beliefs about AI are as extreme as the narratives that are presented in entertainment media. However, our research does not establish that the public attitudes about AI are as extreme as entertainment media portrays them to be, even for those who indicate that they receive their information about AI from entertainment media. For example, when asked to describe AI in a word, our survey respondents thought about existing advanced technologies, such as personal assistants and computers, rather than about futuristic and fictional technologies such as Skynet (The Terminator) and Data (Star Trek: Next Generation). Respondents were largely worried about AI replacing human jobs or running surveillance on people rather than about it taking over the world, even though apocalyptic AI is a common theme in entertainment media. Respondents were also unsure about AI being embodied or having a specific gender, although Cave et al. report that \"there is a tendency to embody AI characters in fiction and specifically to gender them as either male or female.\" And so, entertainment media is not as big of an influence on people's beliefs as we might suspect at first glance. That might be because television and popular culture is not the only source of information that people rely on anymore. AI is now widely discussed on other platforms, such as the news and social media (see Fig. 16 ).",

Another possible explanation is that people are getting better at discerning realistic and unrealistic portrayals of AI in entertainment media, regardless of their purely technical understanding of the technology. As such, people can bracket off purely fictional portrayals of AI when they deem them unrealistic and learn from portrayals that they consider to be more accurate. Respondents who indicated that entertainment media realistically portrays AI were more likely to believe that AI could take over the world and that they could form an emotional bond with AI, and both of those beliefs are the basis of common narratives in films, television, and video games. Yet this same group of respondents was less likely to worry about losing their jobs to AI or the possibility of surveillance. We believe that this apparent contradiction is due to the discrepancy between themes that are explored in entertainment media and those that are discussed in the news, as shown in Cave et al. (2018) , and Fast and Horvitz (2017) . While destructive robots and subversive love stories make for good stories, economic worries and privacy concerns are more appropriately discussed by political stakeholders and policy makers on the news. Future research should critically investigate this hypothesis, as well as the notion that there is a symbiotic relationship between entertainment media, the news industry, and social media when it comes to discussion of AI.",

However, responses show that it is unclear to the respondents if these portrayals were positive or negative (Fig. 18) . Maybe this pattern of responses reflects the idea that AI is a tool, which can be developed properly for the benefit of humanity and can be developed poorly for the detriment of humanity. For example, one focus group member notes that \"AI would not cause a doomsday scenario; someone would cause a doomsday scenario with AI.\" Movies that showcase this duality and this ambiguity are generally perceived to be more realistic because of that choice. And so, while Cave et al. show that narratives around AI tend towards the extreme, such extreme narratives are not necessarily the narratives that shape people's beliefs. Rather, our results show that more balanced narratives are seen as more realistic and those could be the narratives that ultimately influence people's attitude about AI.",

Reports and documentaries are shifting the public's perception about what AI is and what it can do. The documentary film The Social Dilemma was widely popular and could bring attention to more realistic technologies, such as content filtering, rather than to extreme examples of AI that might make for good fiction films. Additional research might also take a more fine-grained approach to analyzing existing media by focusing on specific characters in movies, or on specific episodes or character arcs in TV series, to really understand how audiences are engaging with different portrayals of AI. For example, movies like Star Wars have characters like R2-D2 and C-3PO but also armies of droids that are fighting alongside the villains. And some series such as Black Mirror have episodes in which technological advancements are more positive, and some in which they are more negative or sometimes even neutral.",

If entertainment media has the potential to shape people's beliefs about AI, then could we ever consider fictional narratives to be akin to misinformation? That surely seems like a stretch: fiction can and does serve as information for some audiences but does not exhibit the systematic and targeted aspect that misinformation might carry with it. Regardless, stakeholders might take seriously the potential of entertainment media in shaping people's hopes and worries. After all, if the US military spends millions every year in order to fund movies and games that portray them in a positive light (Lenoir and Caldwell 2018) , then we have reason to believe that there is value in controlling the fictional narratives around AI. Moreover, design decisions need to be informed by the imaginary narratives that are popular in entertainment media (Parikka 2019) . For example, when the NYPD acquired robotic police dogs from Boston Dynamics in 2020, many residents were reminded of the killer robot dogs that were portrayed in \"Metalhead,\" a dystopian Black Mirror episode where humans are hunted by very similar machines. City Council members were quick to mention the resemblance in denouncing NYPD's decision to deploy the robotic dogs in the city. The contract between the NYPD and Boston Dynamics was canceled in April 2021 (Zaveri 2021). Stakeholders should be aware of popular fictional narratives around AI in their policy making and their design, but we leave it to future research to explore those relationships further.",
