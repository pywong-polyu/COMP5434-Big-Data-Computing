The reported frequency of abuse, self-harm and thoughts of suicide/self-harm was higher among women, Black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) groups and people experiencing socioeconomic disadvantage, unemployment, disability, chronic physical illnesses, mental disorders and COVID-19 diagnosis. Psychiatric medications were the most common type of support being used, but fewer than half of those affected were accessing formal or informal support.",

            "text": "The COVID-19 pandemic is presenting an unprecedented global challenge not just for infectious disease medicine but also for mental healthcare. Concerns about the psychological, social and neurological impact of the disease have been reported, 1 along with preliminary data suggesting adverse effects on a range of aspects of mental health, including anxiety and depression. 2 Self-harm, suicidal thoughts and abuse are already substantial problems in the UK. The prevalence of life-time experience of self-harming was reported to be 6.4% in 2014; 3 prevalence of lifetime thoughts of suicide was around 20.6%, with 5.4% reporting such thoughts in the previous year; 4 and 7.5% of women and 3.8% of men reported experiencing abuse from a partner or family member in the year ending March 2019. 5 But there have been rising concerns about people experiencing higher levels of psychological or physical abuse while social distancing at home during the COVID-19 pandemic, alongside increases in selfharming or suicidal ideation. Staying at home because of social distancing measures could increase the exposure of individuals to violence and abuse. 6 Economic adversity and unemployment could lead to additional stress for individuals, especially disadvantaged and vulnerable groups. 7, 8 Individuals may be unable to access usual social networks that could provide support and may experience increased loneliness and isolation. Additionally, pressures on health services have led to disruptions to existing mental health services and reductions in use by individuals. 7 All of these factors are linked with higher rates of self-harm, suicide and poor mental health outcomes. 9, 10 Already, some helplines have reported increases in the volume of calls since lockdown began and other data also suggest an increase in abuse-related incidents. 7 However, data about the characteristics of people reporting such experiences in the UK during the COVID-19 pandemic are still scarce. Further, it is unclear whether people experiencing abuse and self-harming are managing to access any support. This is vital to understand in order to identify what further support is needed. Therefore, this study sought to address these evidence gaps by exploring patterns of abuse, self-harm and thoughts of suicide or self-harm in the UK in the first month of lockdown due the COVID-19 pandemic and exploring whether those having such experiences were accessing formal or informal mental health support.",

Physical abuse was measured by asking participants if they had been 'physically harmed or hurt by someone else'. Psychological abuse was measured by asking if participants had been 'bullied, controlled, intimidated, or psychologically hurt by someone else'. All responses were about the previous week and measured on a four-point scale from 'not at all' to 'nearly every day'.

Comparisons with usual prevalence levels are challenging given that (i) our sample, though well-stratified and weighted to population proportions, was not random, (ii) underreporting of abuse remains likely, especially if people were living with their abuser during lockdown, (iii) our recruitment strategy involved partnership work with charities representing vulnerable people who may therefore have been more likely to report self-harm or abuse, and (iv) most prevalence data report on levels over a 12-month period or over a lifetime, whereas this study reported on a single month of lockdown. Therefore, the figures presented here are not intended to be accurate estimates of prevalence.
