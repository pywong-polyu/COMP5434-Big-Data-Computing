While it is known that pregnancy, due to a combination of physiologic changes that affect coagulation factors and blood flow stasis secondary to inferior vena cava compression by the enlarged uterus, puts patients in a hypercoagulable state [7] , because of the paucity of cases, the precise pathogenesis behind the formation of mesenteric venous thromboses during pregnancy is largely unknown. However, the effects are potentially devastating to both the mother and the fetus. Among 15 cases reported by Guan et al, 40% (6/15) ultimately resulted in fetal death or abortion, and one in maternal death [6] . With acute occlusion of mesenteric veins, marked elevations in capillary pressures occur, which lead to bowel wall edema, submucosal hemorrhage, and transmural bowel infarction [8] . Without timely diagnosis and treatment, this eventually results in septic shock and death.",

Laboratory findings, such as leukocytosis and elevated C-reactive protein, are also fairly nonspecific in working up abdominal pain [9, 11] . Complicating matters further is the fact that abdominal pain is a frequent antepartum complaint and is in itself a diagnostic challenge [1] . Factors that contribute to the difficulty of evaluating antepartum abdominal pain include the displacement of abdominal and pelvic structures from their normal locations by the gravid uterus, which makes abdominal examination relatively unreliable, and the physiological leukocytosis that occurs during pregnancy, which can mask the inflammatory response of the underlying pathology [1] . More importantly, acute abdominal pain in pregnant women tends to be non-localized and disproportionate to the physical findings, often persisting beyond two to three hours [12] . Therefore, imaging is essential to ensuring timely and accurate diagnosis.",

In nonpregnant patients, CTA offers high accuracy for the diagnosis of acute mesenteric ischemia, with reported sensitivities and specificities as high as 93% to 100% and the potential ability to improve patient survival [14] . However, the high accuracy of CTA is likely because the majority of mesenteric ischemia is due to arterial occlusion rather than venous occlusion. Venous phase abdominal CT for the diagnosis of mesenteric ischemia has been less well studied. Kirkpatrick et al. reported that the addition of arterial phase imaging influenced care in 19% of patients, compared to portal venous phase imaging alone [15] . The presence of mesenteric venous filling defects, which appear as central areas of low attenuation within an enhanced vessel, are the cardinal findings of mesenteric venous thrombosis [10] . Other suggestive though less specific findings include engorgement of mesenteric veins, mesenteric edema, and the presence of collateral vessels [13] . In addition, circumferential bowel wall thickening and abnormal bowel wall enhancement are the most common signs of bowel ischemia [13] . Further, the presence of intraperitoneal fluid carries a poor prognosis, as it may indicate progression to bowel infarction [13] . However, despite the advantages of abdominal CT, the radiation dose imposed upon the fetus is a concern. Therefore, the benefits and risks associated with CT should be discussed with the patient prior to obtaining imaging.",

            "text": "Due to its lack of ionizing radiation, MRI has always been considered one of the most important diagnostic tools for abdominal pain in the pregnant patient. Previous reports have shown that MRI is accurate for the diagnosis of mesenteric thrombosis, with some studies reporting nearly 100% sensitivity and specificity for MR angiography (MRA) [16] . One of the advantages of MRI is its ability to determine the age of the thrombus [13] . Acute to subacute thrombi, less than 5 weeks old, are likely to have higher signal intensity compared to the liver on T1 and T2-weighted sequences, whereas chronic thrombi tend to show a significant decrease in signal intensity on T1-weighted sequences [13] . MRI may also offer evidence of the potential cause of the thrombus formation, such as acute pancreatitis, cirrhosis, or hepatocellular carcinoma, and can also rule in or out other causes of antepartum abdominal pain [13, 16] . MRA, especially with gadolinium, with its capacity to better depict the vascular structures in the abdomen, provides even higher diagnostic accuracy compared to conventional MRI [16] . However, the use of gadolinium in pregnant patients has remained controversial for decades and is to be generally avoided if clinically feasible in Taiwan. Our case is a wonderful example of the merits of non-contrast MRI in the diagnosis of mesenteric venous thrombosis and a reminder that the diagnosis can often be made or at least inferred without the administration of gadolinium.",

If there are no signs of bowel infarction, the patient can be managed conservatively with fluid resuscitation, broad-spectrum antibiotics, bowel rest and, most importantly, systemic anticoagulation [9] . However, surgery should not be delayed if bowel necrosis or perforation are suspected, and in such cases immediate exploration with either an open or laparoscopic approach should be performed. The infarcted segment of bowel should be adequately resected and the adjacent segments can be directly anastomosed. Some advocate catheter-based thrombolysis or mechanical thrombectomy as an adjuvant to anticoagulation, though the current evidence is not yet adequate to definitively support its use [9] . The cause of the hypercoagulability should be identified following emergent management so as to determine the future use of anticoagulation [9] . Special consideration in pregnant patients is warranted when certain diagnostic or treatment techniques may affect the gestation. Previous reports have shown that vaginal delivery of a normal baby is possible even when mesenteric venous thrombosis occurs at an early gestational age [6] , though careful evaluation is necessary, and as always, continued communication with the patient is vital.",
