This practice has brought serious damage to our social trust, especially to online media, which is one of the most important channels for information acquisition in our daily life. Currently, clickbait is spreading on the internet and causing serious damage to society. However, research on clickbait detection has not yet been well performed. Almost all existing research treats clickbait detection as a binary classification task and only uses the title as the input. This shallow usage of information and detection technology not only suffers from low performance in real detection (e.g., it is easy to bypass) but is also difficult to use in further research (e.g., potential empirical studies). In this work, we proposed a novel clickbait detection model that incorporated a knowledge graph, a graph convolutional network and a graph attention network to conduct fine-grained-level clickbait detection. According to experiments using a real dataset, our novel proposed model outperformed classical and state-of-the-art baselines. In addition, certain explainability can also be achieved in our model through the graph attention network. Our fine-grained-level results can provide a measurement foundation for future empirical study. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to incorporate a knowledge graph and deep learning technique to detect clickbait and achieve explainability.",

            "text": "meticulously designed and prepared so that audiences can catch the information they hope to transfer easily. In contrast, the aim of clickbait is merely to induce people to click; thus, the aim will have been fulfilled after the clicking. In other words, there is no need for audiences to read any of the subsequent content, and the information carried by the content does not matter at all after the clicking. One possible reason why many researchers mixed these two concepts is the fact that the most fake news employs the trick of clickbait to accelerate the speed of spread, as mentioned above. The mixture of these two concepts will lead to unreliable detection results. Second, previous studies on clickbait have only examined titles [25] . According to the definition, the essence of clickbait is to construct a curiosity gap in the title that cannot be fulfilled by the corresponding content. This indicates that the key characteristic of clickbait is the difference between the \"promise\" the title makes and the extent of the following redemption. Apparently, only using the title as the input is insufficient and incorrect for clickbait detection. Third, most existing research considers clickbait detection as a binary classification task [18] . Previous research has revealed that the attributes (e.g., degree and type) of clickbait vary [30] . For instance, a low degree of clickbait may enliven the atmosphere under certain conditions, while a high degree of clickbait may anger the reader. Thus, it is necessary and important to perform fine-grainedlevel clickbait detection other than binary classification.",

            "text": "According to cognition theory [4] , prior knowledge plays an important role in human cognition, such as reading. For instance, metaphor is a common rhetorical strategy in literary creation and is also widely adopted by clickbait. Prior knowledge of related concepts is indispensable to comprehending metaphors. Thus, it is necessary and important to adopt prior knowledge in clickbait detection. One practical problem is how to effectively incorporate prior knowledge in limited computation. One reason for many previous studies only using article titles in clickbait detection lies in the difficulty of making use of long and complex article content. Inspired by human memory and thinking, a knowledge graph (KG), which conceptualizes knowledge as entities and the relationships among them, has been proposed [11] . Previous research has verified the effective knowledge representation of KG in various fields [39] . In our research, we constructed a global KG to conceptualize knowledge in online media. Then, a graph convolutional network (GCN) was adopted to predict the clickbait level of a given article. The aim of clickbait is to attract people's attention. Thus, it is intuitive to take attention into consideration in our design. In this research, we developed a graph attention model to enhance our GCN on the learning and prediction process based on KG. Moreover, the combination of GCN and graph attention also brings certain interpretability to our results.",

            "text": "The contributions of our research are fourfold. First, we utilized a knowledge graph to make an enriched representation of online articles and introduced external background knowledge to facilitate content comprehension, which would alleviate the challenge brought by the informality and dynamics of the online media content. Second, we developed a graph convolutional network (GCN) to make deep use of the information provided by the knowledge graph. Compared with a convolutional neural network (CNN), a GCN directly performs convolution operations on irregular networks. It could make use of the information beyond direct spatial connections, simultaneously reducing the computational cost since knowledge presented by KG is much denser than plain images. Third, we proposed a graph attention model to enhance the performance of our GCN, which would also bring certain explainability to our results. Fourth, instead of treating clickbait detection as a binary classification task, we performed fine-grained-level detection, which would be helpful for further related studies, such as investigating the influence of various levels of clickbait on article readership. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we review existing research on clickbait detection and summarize related techniques. Our proposed model is described in Section 3. In Section 4, we verify the effectiveness of our proposed model on a real dataset and compare its performance with classical and state-of-the-art algorithms. Finally, we summarize our research and propose future work in Section 5.",

As the battle for network flow is becoming increasingly fierce, clickbait has been widely used to grab users' attention and obtain network flow. However, the side effects of clickbait along with helping platforms obtain network flow have been proven to be very harmful to our society. Thus, many attempts have been made to detect and prevent clickbait. For instance, Chakraborty et al. [5] developed a browser plug-in named \"Stop Clickbait\" based on a machine learning classifier. They extracted 14 features from headlines and then employed a support vector machine (SVM) to conduct the detection task. Rony et al. [32] designed an embedded model of distributed expressions to recognize clickbait from a large corpus. Dong et al. [10] tested a method that used similarity and quality features for clickbait detection. Pujahari and Sisodia [30] developed a hybrid classification framework that combined different features, sentence structure, and clustering to distinguish clickbait and nonclickbait. Zheng et al. [44] formed a deep model based on the combination of lure and similarity and made reasonable predictions using an adaptive prediction mechanism.",

As mentioned above, it is unreliable to classify an article as a clickbait without considering the article content. Some headlines may look like very \"unrealistic\" or \"shocking\" since they create a huge curiosity gap that seems difficult or even impossible to fulfill. However, if their article contents are \"rich\" and \"hot\" enough to fill the curiosity gap, they cannot be recognized as clickbait. Worse still, such \"hot\" articles are usually very important and serious (e.g., breaking news on sudden crisis). If these articles were classified as clickbait and blocked by a clickbait detection system only because the headlines were too \"unrealistic\" or \"shocking\", the diffusion of this valuable and important information would be blocked, which would ultimately lead to serious consequences. Thus, in our research, we will return to the definition of clickbait and make more reliable detections.",

Thus, one of the most serious challenges we need to face is how to present the article content well before we adopt it into the detection model.

NER can recognize embedded named entities, such as human names and place names. In our work, we adopt a widely used Chinese NER package provided by HIT [7] . We also used noun terms recognized by part-of-speech as a supplement to enrich the information represented by the graph.

However, most exaggeration terms are adjectives or adverbs associated with a subject, which is usually a noun. Thus, even though we used noun terms recognized by part-of-speech as supplements to named entities, some crucial information was ignored. To solve this challenge, we added an extra operation in addition to entity (node) recognition and relation (edge) identification-attribute extraction.

In this paper, we constructed a GCN-based model to conduct fine-grained-level clickbait detection. First, we used a knowledge graph (KG) to make brief but rich representations of articles. The global KG could also bring rich background information that facilitates the comprehension of the content (e.g., metaphors). Then, we developed a GCN to conduct fine-grained-level prediction.
