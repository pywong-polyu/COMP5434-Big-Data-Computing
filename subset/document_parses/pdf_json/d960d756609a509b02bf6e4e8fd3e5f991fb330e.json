            "text": "It is a common belief that adverse reactions after vaccination are predictive signs of a good immune response; yet limited data is available. Vaccine reactogenicity characterizes the physical manifestation of the inflammatory response to a vaccine and can result in injection site and systemic symptoms. Some symptoms can be measured objectively, others are nonspecific and subjective. There are many factors that can influence reactogenicity; host-derived factors include age and gender, extrinsic factors dose number and injection technique [1] . Safety findings in the BNT162b2 phase 2/3 trial described reactogenicity as mild or moderate. Systemic reactogenicity was more common and severe after the second dose with events transient and resolving within a couple of days [2] . Real world data in users of the coronavirus disease (COVID) Symptom Study app in the United Kingdom found local side effects after BNT162b2 first and second vaccination with a frequency of 71.9% versus 68.5%, and systemic side effects with 13.5% versus 22.0%. Side effects were more prevalent in women and in vaccinees 55 years or younger [3] . The inflammatory response towards a vaccine normally leads into a measurable humoral and cell-mediated immune response. The most important immunological parameter in vaccine licensure is antibody levels [4] . For COVID-19 vaccines, binding and even more neutralizing antibodies are thought to be potential immune correlates of protection [5, 6] . The significance of the cell-mediated immune responses against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is less understood. It is suggested that a balanced immune response of high titers of neutralizing antibodies and TH1-biased T-cells is probably optimal [7] . Whereas antibody responses appear to be short-lived, T cell memory is potentially more durable [8, 9] .",

For our study, we selected the most severely affected vaccinees from a recruitment population of 735 and compared them with controls who indicated no or only minor injection side symptoms after both vaccinations. When planning our study, we were thinking of a severity score for adverse reactions but found it rather difficult to value symptoms.

These differences can be attributed to the influence of environmental factors, sex chromosome genes and sex hormones on immune responses [19] . In our recruitment population of 735 vaccinees, sick leave after vaccination with BNT162b2 occurred more often in women than in men. Actually, females in the adverse reaction group were \"sicker\" than corresponding males because the majority (13/18) reported sick leave after first and second vaccination whereas most males reported sick leave only after second vaccination (14/20) .
