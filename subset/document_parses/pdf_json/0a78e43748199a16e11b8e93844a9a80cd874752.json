In recent years the pace of this change has accelerated, due to factors such as globalization, digitization, and the shift to working from home. Different factors are relevant when selecting employment, e.g., cultural fit, compensation, provided degree of freedom. To successfully fulfill an occupation the gap between required (by the job) and possessed (by the job seeker) skills needs to be as small as possible. Decreasing this skill-gap improves the fit between a job candidate and occupation.",

In most realistic situations however, we may want to explore how a node can be linked to any other node, making the number of comparisons, or edges to predict 1-to-(N-1), i.e., for each node we compare each other node (excluding self). To approximate this real world performance the ratio of negative to positive edges should reflect these more realistic proportions. To do so we compute F1-score at increasing ratios of positive-to-negative edges, ranging from 1 (as shown in Table 3 ) to 7. Results are shown in Figure 4 . The figure shows that up to ratio of 3:1, N2V is on par with PA, but as ratios increase, N2V outperforms PA, suggesting N2V is better suited for most real world situations. ",

Several skills, such as teamwork, are commonly required for a large number of occupations, which can be considered generic or sector-independent skills. At the other side, we may have highly specialized skills, that are only required for specific occupations or occupation groups. Whether a skill is specifically or generically important can be quantified in different ways. For a skill to be specific to an occupation or occupational group, we define two criteria:",

We opted for a naive character -gram based method for matching surface forms found in a job posting with skill names in ESCO. Obviously, more refined methods can be employed, e.g., by considering additional representation of the skill in the job posting (contextual words, occupation), and at the same time additional context at the side of the KG (e.g., skill descriptions, associated occupations, etc.). In general, this problem of matching can be considered an entity linking task, which is considered out of scope for this application paper.

Validating if, e.g., the discovered paths between occupations indeed are practically the shortest one, requires additional data. Unfortunately, no such data was available at the time of writing. One place to acquire such data, is, e.g., by collecting data of historic career paths. However, collecting such data and composing was determined out of scope for this work. The same arose for the method for quantifying the relevance of skills per ISCO group; these aggregated insights were difficult to validate. We could imagine involving human expert annotators to annotate which skills they deem (most) relevant to a certain ISCO (group). However, similarly to the above, collecting and analyzing such data did not fit in the scope of our present work.
