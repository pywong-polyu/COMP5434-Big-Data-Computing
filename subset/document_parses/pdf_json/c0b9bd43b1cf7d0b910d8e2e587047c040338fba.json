There is an overwhelming need to find a treatment for this virus as early as possible. Computer algorithms and deep learning can participate positively by finding a potential treatment for SARS-CoV-2. In this paper, a deep learning model and machine learning methods for the classification of potential coronavirus treatments on a single human cell will be presented. The dataset selected in this work is a subset of the publicly online datasets available on RxRx.ai. The objective of this research is to automatically classify a single human cell according to the treatment type and the treatment concentration level. A DCNN model and a methodology are proposed throughout this work. The methodical idea is to convert the numerical features from the original dataset to the image domain and then fed them up into a DCNN model. The proposed DCNN model consists of three convolutional layers, three ReLU layers, three pooling layers, and two fully connected layers. The experimental results show that the proposed DCNN model for treatment classification (32 classes) achieved 98.05% in testing accuracy if it is compared with classical machine learning such as support vector machine, decision tree, and ensemble. In treatment concentration level prediction, the classical machine learning (ensemble) algorithm achieved 98.5% in testing accuracy while the proposed DCNN model achieved 98.2%. The performance metrics strengthen the obtained results from the conducted experiments for the accuracy of treatment classification and treatment concentration level prediction.",

This led to set an alarm about viruses and their devastating impact in the new century. The 2019 latest coronavirus was described by the World Health Organization (WHO) in the form of 2019-nCov (COVID-19) (Singhal 2020; Loey et al. 2020a ). The 2019 coronavirus was identified as the SARS-CoV-2 by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) in 2020 (Lai et al. 2020; Li et al. 2020; Sharfstein et al. 2020 ). More than 500,000 fatalities in 213 countries and territories were affected by an outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 before the date of the published article (Worldometer 2020) . The transmission of coronavirus (person to person) was spreading so fast for example, in Italy (Giovanetti et al. 2020) , US (Holshue et al. 2020) , India (Khattar et al. 2020) , and Germany (Rothe et al. 2020 ). On 10 July 2020, SARS-CoV-2 confirmed more than 12 million cases, 6 million recovered cases, and 550,000 death cases. Figure 1 shows some statistics about recovered and death cases of COVID-19 map 2020).",

Data augmentation increases the number of images used for training by applying label-preserving transformations. Also, it is applied to the training set to make the The augmentation process raises the number of images from 3750 images to 15,000 images, 3 times larger than the original dataset.

One of the methods that can help to defeat this virus is trying approved treatments on human cells as a primary stop to shorten the gap between treatments and finding an actual cure. Computer algorithms and deep learning can close that gap and help in finding a cure. In this paper, a deep learning model and machine learning methods for the classification of potential coronavirus treatments on a single human cell. The dataset selected in work is a subset of the publicly online dataset on RxRx.ai. The objective of this research is to automatically classify the human cell according to treatment and treatment concentration levels. The proposed DCNN model and methodology are based on converting the numerical features from the original dataset to the image domain. The proposed model consists of three convolutional layers, three ReLU layers, three pooling layers, and two fully connected layers. The experimental results showed that the proposed DCNN model for treatment classification (32 classes) achieved 98.05% testing accuracy if it is compared with classical machine learning such as support vector machine, decision tree, and ensemble. In treatment concentration level prediction, the classical machine learning (ensemble) algorithm achieved 98.5% testing accuracy while the proposed DCNN model achieved 98.2%. One of the potential future work is performing same experiments with deep transfer models such as Alexnet and Resnet50 or even deeper neural networks to investigate its performance with used dataset in this research.",
