One of the 10 cases with DM had been previously undiagnosed and had his first presentation of DKA with coexisting ROCM. The two remaining non-diabetic cases (16.7%) had a known underlying hematological malignancy (acute lymphocytic leukemia) and had received recent chemotherapy.

On radiological assessment (Figure 3) , all cases developed orbital infiltration with two cases (16.7%) having bilateral involvement. Four cases (33.3%) developed cavernous sinus infiltration, two cases (16.7%) developed internal carotid artery infiltration, and two cases (16.7%) developed a cerebral abscess. COVID-19 coinfection was neither associated with specific presenting signs of ROCM nor did it affect our management course. All cases received medical treatment for ROCM including measures to control the general condition, underlying risk factors, and complications, together with systemic antifungals and antibiotics to prevent secondary bacterial infection. Seven cases (58.3%) were fit to undergo surgical debridement (Figure 2B) , five of which (71.4%) had a non-salvageable eye globe on the affected side that was sacrificed during surgery. The final outcome was recovery and discharge in seven patients (58.3%) and death due to complication in five patients (41.7%), three of which had COVID-19 and two had received systemic steroids. ",

It is worth noting that the Egyptian national guidelines for COVID-19 (16) during the examined interval included hydroxychloroquine treatment for all diagnosed cases regardless of severity and hydrocortisone for severe cases. Other implicated factors for COVID-19 in ROCM development may include aggravated disruption of blood sugar control and general debilitation in diabetic patients and/or late seeking of medical care during lockdown resulting in more DKA events.",

For example, in a previous report (17) about ROCM from the University of California, Los Angeles, 28 cases were diagnosed in all centers over a period of 40 years. Another report (3) from North Carolina described 13 cases of ROCM presenting over a period of 14 years.
