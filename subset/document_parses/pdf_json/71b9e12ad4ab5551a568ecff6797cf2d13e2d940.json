            "text": "Payments banks came into existence in India in 2015 when the Reserve Bank of India awarded licenses to eleven applicants to set up these banks specifically to further financial inclusion by providing small savings accounts and facilitating payments and remittances to the financially excluded population. As of March 2020, only six of these were operative and not very successful, both from the profitability and customer growth perspectives. This article seeks to understand the reason for payments banks not taking off as envisaged. Attributing this primarily to low adoption of payments banks by the financially excluded customer segments, this study uses a grounded theory approach based on data collected from interviews of target customer groups and of managers at some payments banks. The primary factors contributing to low adoption by the customer segments studied here, namely migrant labor and small vendors, have been identified as lack of awareness, lack of trust and lack of perceived need for their products/services. These factors arise due to inconsistencies between the business model design and the nature of the target audience. The article further discusses managerial and policy implications of these conclusions.",

The primary objective for setting up PB was to provide access to financial services to migrant labor, small-business enterprises and low-income households (Carstens 2019) . Of the 41 expressions of interest received by the RBI from corporate houses and other eligible entities, eleven applicants were granted licenses. 1 These were firms from diverse sectors possessing varied competencies equipped to pioneer this new financial business model of financial inclusion through low-cost digital payment systems. However, the hype around these banks quickly tapered off, as only six of the eleven license holders were active as on March 31 2020. As per RBI's report on Trend and Progress of Banking in India 2019-2020, PBs have continued to incur losses which subsequently rose to INR 937.1 crores in 2018-19 from INR 517.2 crores in 2017-18. 2 The net consolidated loss of PBs for the year 2019-20 still remains high at INR 833 crores, and this could be attributed to the high operating expenses of these banks (RBI 2020).",

In many ways, PBs appear to be similar to mobile money wallets like M-Pesa of Kenya. However, there are distinct dissimilarities between PB and mobile wallets. Mobile wallets are primarily used to make transactions like booking tickets, paying fees and miscellaneous expenses (Singh et al. 2017) . The user needs a \"reservoir\" such as a bank account or credit card from where to load the wallet. The wallet is not an instrument meant for depositing one's savings, and it is only used to facilitate payments. PBs, on the other hand, are meant to function like banks \"on the CASA front\" while not allowed credit origination or lending. Other differences from mobile wallets include periodic interest payments on the deposits and the brick-and-mortar form of these banks, lending them a different form of visibility from the mobile wallets whose presence is restricted to the mobile phone in the hands of a user.",

Academic literature on the adoption of technology by consumers is rich and vast. Industries and governments, often to expand their scope and reach, launch an array of new products and/or services which in turn provide a stimulus to the economic activity of the region. Ryu (2018) had recognized the ability that advances in technology had provided the non-banking organizations to offer novel financial services, while IT and Telecommunications companies have been trying to change the status quo in the financial sector (Arner et al. 2016). Oliveira et al. (2016) observed that technology shows promise when deployed for delivery of financial products and services, such as crowdfunding, bill payment, account transfers, person-to-person transfers among others. Technology has also enabled banks to respond to customer inquiries and problems quickly, increase internal efficiency and productivity, reduce labor costs, and assist in achieving financial inclusion in most parts of the world. However, the impact of technology, as observed by Mick and Fournier (1998) , is something of a double-edged sword: It can be both detrimental and beneficial and have rarely come with exclusively positive or negative implications for the customers (Walker et al. 2002) . Services that are rendered using technology, often end up reducing access, frustrating and intimidating users, depersonalizing the service experience, and creating a difference between customers and service personnel (Walker et al. 2000) .",

Walden and Browne (2009) observed that the adoption of information technology and its information are not just an accident, but it is often trailed by the information that is gathered by a person, which is in-turn conveyed through the person's behavior. Therefore, it becomes imperative for regulators, banks, and other financial institutions to figure out the most effective way in which banks and their services can become an acceptable solution for the unbanked section of the populace, through technology.",

A grounded theory approach, with personal unstructured interviews, was seen as a more effective approach. We interviewed a total of 34 respondents-22 contractual migrant laborers, five self-employed migrants and seven small-business owners. In order to conduct faceto-face interviews with the migrant laborers and small businesses, and to ensure the reliability of the data collected the researchers traveled separately to mandis, 7 construction sites, vegetable markets and bus stands in and around the northern states of Haryana, Rajasthan, and Delhi.

The interviews were conducted in Hindi, and the conversations transcribed into English. An attempt has been made to maintain the spirit of the responses and not lose/alter any key information in the translation. We focused on selecting respondents who had remitted money to their friends or family members at least once in the last two years. The interview structure was initially left free flowing, without any strict protocols to avoid imposing any theoretical frameworks on the respondents' thought process. Few initial questions like, \"Do you take the help of any bank to send money?\" or \"How often do you use banking services for your financial needs?\" were used to start the conversation (see Appendix for the Interview Protocol). This evolved into a semi-structured interview framework with broad interview protocols to avoid diversion from the object of our study. All questions were openended which allowed the respondents time and an unbiased canvas to speak about their adoption or non-adoption of PB services. After obtaining due consent from the interviewees, we recorded the interviews to make sure we had our concentration on the conversation. When we framed the initial questions we made sure that our beliefs, theoretical understanding or even our interests were not imposed or made known to the interviewees. The interviewees were constantly encouraged to elaborate more and express their reasons. Initial questions about the kind of work the respondents were involved in and their level of financial activity helped weed out those who already had an operative bank account (financially included). We continued conducting interviews with more respondents until we reached theoretical saturation with further interviews not providing additional insights (Horv\u00e1th and Mitev 2015; Papathanassis and Knolle 2011) . Besides the 34 respondents comprising the target customer segment, theoretical sampling and constant comparison led us to interview three PB branch managers to understand their perspective on the subject and for possible additional insights. These interviews were conducted as person-toperson conversations at the PB premises and also helped in triangulation and validating the arguments, themes and insights derived from our main respondents (Creswell 1998; Denzin and Lincoln 2011) .",

The constant comparison method and theoretical sampling herein helped us to formulate a strategy which would then drive the process of data collection (Giske and Artinian 2007) . The constant comparison technique required us to verify that ever code created was new (Gandomani and Nafchi 2016) and hence paved the way for creating emerging categories for non-adoption of PB. Each category takes the analysis further, encompassing several-related concepts (Glaser 1978) . Memos were maintained to help establish relationship between interviews and the concepts that emerged from those interviews. The initial analysis allowed us to group small pieces of data and label them based on their characteristics. The emergence of new concepts and categories guided us with the theoretical sampling process. This included looking for respondents possessing different perspectives to the problem at hand, for example, interviewing PB managers in addition to the target customer segments. Glaser (1978) proposes to hold progression to selective coding until a core category is found during the open coding phase. These core categories act like the first step around which we aim to explain the phenomena under study. Each core category was worked out after making sure that other emerging categories and their properties were meaningfully related to the core category and all the primary issues of the respondents revolved around the core category of this study. Our analysis of the data revealed 'Impediments to adoption' as the core category leading to low customer adoption of PB services. These impediments appeared to be a serious challenge faced by the target customers which were reconfirmed by our conversations with the bank managers. Finally, to begin with the process of integration and refining the findings, we moved on to selective coding to identify categories that were closely related to the core category.",

Small businesses that we interviewed during the course of this research revealed how cash was preferred over any other mode of payment, as only cash was extensively used by all the suppliers of these small businesses. Cash still remains a preferred choice of payment for most Indians, and this can also be substantiated by the fact that around 84-93% of the transactions conducted in the mandis of India in the year 2018-2019 were conducted on cash basis (RBI 2019b).",

Such perceived complexities emerge as barriers to the adoption of PB, as seen in the case of other financial services too (Szmigin and Bourne 1999; Laukkanen and Lauronen 2005) . Respondents during our interaction revealed that officials at the PB demand for a local address proof to open an account with them. Incidentally, the requirement for a local address proof had long been discontinued by the central bank, 8 but seems to not have been properly communicated to the target audience (migrant laborer, small business units). Additionally, the Government of India has also eased the rules and norms for migrant labors permitting them to give a self-declared local address as a proof of residence. 9 Lack of awareness, as discussed in Sect. 4.2.1, further compounds the problem, especially when it affects at various levels of adoption.",

The Bank Mitras are responsible for delivering financial services like transfer of money, opening of a bank account, facilitating withdrawal and deposits on a commission basis (Ujjawal et al., 2012) . The commission that these BCs charge for an account-to-account transfer usually varies from Rs. 5 to Rs. 10 per transfer, or 0.2% to 0.5% of the amount deposited, typically more for withdrawals than deposits. Almost all the migrant labor interviewed was found to be using the Bank Mitras, informally also known as the 'Money Transfer Agents' to send money to their families back home. Here, the sender and the receiver do not need bank accounts to transfer or receive money. The receiver can collect the money from the agent at a collection point on furnishing an identity proof.

Prior research has documented security, more often than not, to be important to the perceived reliability of a product where significant money is involved (Roboff and Charles 1998) . The migrant labor population is generally not tech-savvy and needs physical evidence that instills a sense of security and trust with the bank. A study by Cooper (1997) revealed \"the level of risk\" as a significant feature from a probable user's perspective in the adoption of innovation. Our analysis revealed that lack of physical documents like a pass book which a PB is not allowed to issue impedes the process of adoption of PBs.

Social connections and group-think are far higher at the bottom-of-thepyramid sections , and it is but natural that they adopt channels that are tried and tested by their peers for financial transactions and transfers. The convenience of and entrenchment of the existing mode by habit coupled with the attendant costs of switching have resulted in resistance and inertia to even experiment with PB. Herd mentality further accentuates the problem of lack of perceived need and creates trust deficit. All these result in an inertia to change, thereby further eroding the perceived need for the service.",

This has happened despite demonetization of high value notes undertaken in November 2016 by the Government of India. For migrant labor, there is a concern around costs associated with opening a bank account, and for small businesses, there are concerns associated with the costs of depositing and withdrawing money from their bank accounts. Besides the direct costs involved, effort involved in learning and becoming comfortable with technology has proven to be a big barrier in switching to PBs. Existing channels like the bank mitras are giving a tough fight to the PB model in showing any incremental value they can bring to the customer given the monetary, time and effort related cost it involves. These costs include the money and time to switch to and learn the new technology, time to be spent for opening an account and understanding the workings, further adding to the perception that there is no real need to switch.",

The sense of insecurity became so deep-seated that even when this regulation was relaxed, it has not seemed to have helped the situation. This seems to have been partly due to a perceived lack of trust and security while probably more due to loss of interest in the product once the potential customer was disillusioned by it.",

The PB seem to have been introduced as a product into a market that already had existing viable alternatives like microfinance institutions and small finance banks. This is over and above those held with regional rural banks and cooperative banks that specifically cater to small savers. Financial services business models, that leverage technology and have been popularized by Fin-tech startups, have seen significant traction in this environment. As a result, the innovations are becoming finer, catering to the specific needs of narrower markets. In their eagerness to come up with the next big breakthrough, firms sometimes fail to scrutinize all elements of the business model thoroughly. In itself, this is not a big deal in the world of start-ups and innovation. But when this is backed by state regulation, huge budgets involving big money and effort by the entrepreneurs, the failures can be more expensive. Also, failure caused due to a poor business model can kill an otherwise good idea or need, financial inclusion in this case. This study has implications for both academic research in the area of financial services and technology adoption. Besides, it has relevance for policy-makers.",

They-migrant labor and small businesses/merchants, where the latter includes migrants who evolve to start something on their own and are hence, self-employed-are indeed two different segments as each faces its own unique set of factors contributing toward the non-adoption of PB.

Communication channels and messaging being used, feedback on the service and further corrections and their communication outward, mitigating security and trust concerns of the populace are some very important factors regulators and policy-makers need to work on when launching a new service or product. Most of all, any consumer has to be convinced of the need for the service and how it will be more beneficial over existing alternatives. While we have not examined the communication strategy and channels used to popularize PB among the financially excluded, the ineffectiveness of any such communication to create awareness and comfort seems apparent. A related aspect for recall and comfort is observability and visibility of the innovation. As Black et al. (2001) conclude that the probability of an innovation being adopted is directly related to its observability.",

Moreover, no qualitative study has been conducted to understand the various factors that impede the adoption of PB.

As Yap (2017) points out in the words of Kumar Saurabh Singh, partner at Khaitan and Co; \"Though the small accounts with payment banks are subject to simplified know your customer, antimoney laundering and combating the financing of terrorism norms, the thresholds differentiating a small account from a regular account aren't that different, and the otherwise not needed compliance may become difficult to manage for payment banks\" (p. 1). Ubiquity and testability can help in reducing the perceived security risk that often accompanies an innovation (Ram and Sheth 1989; Johnson et al. 2018) . Inertia and resistance to change are natural human tendencies, and costs act as an important determinant to adopt financial services (Kleijnen et al. 2004) . Switching costsmonetary, time and effort-only add to the inertia.",

They need to understand how the non-users can be encouraged to adopt this route for their payment solutions. Regulators and PB will have to develop markets and estimate how their service can fit within the existing activities undertaken by the target audience such as migrant laborers and small businesses. This can also be done by integrating the preceding activities of the migrant laborers with the PB; for example, can a wage account be opened like conventional salary accounts? The critical mass thus obtained can be users on one side and then used to attract the other side (small merchants) to also adopt the system. The regulator needs to provide operational flexibility to PB so that these banks can cater to the needs of the intended audience.",

PB seem to have been more successful with the youth of the country, especially the Gen-Y and Gen-Z sections, who are looking for a quick, inexpensive and reliable payment system that can reside inside their smartphones and can be completely driven by technology. We also believe that it would be hasty to speculate on the generalizability of the factors to the entire population. The findings of this study are derived from the respondents which were all men. The women migrant labours when approached for this study always directed us toward the men of the house, and for small businesses we were always confronted by men who used to manage the busniess. Therefore, future studies should focus on conducting similar exploratory or interpretive studies focusing on the migrant labor and small businesses from other parts of the country. Researchers undertaking a qualitative study are generally looking to understand a phenomena and not for a finding which can be generalized. The current study is exploratory in nature, and it needs to be followed by a thorough quantitative analysis which can also help in validating the findings of this study.",

The way forward in our opinion would be to understand the needs, motivations and also apprehensions of these groups and afford customized solutions for them. It would be worthwhile to conduct an interpretive study of the PB to understand any strategies laid down by them to overcome the issues raised in this research. Future research can also look at gauging the customer satisfaction with the alternative payments channels, and also customer satisfaction of the existing PBs' users.
