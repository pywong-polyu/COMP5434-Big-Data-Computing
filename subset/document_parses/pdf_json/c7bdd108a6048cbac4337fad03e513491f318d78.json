Hundreds of millions of people have developed COVID-19 [1] , ranging from asymptomatic infection to respiratory failure and ARDS requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation [1] [2] [3] . Pulmonary fibrosis is one known sequela of severe COVID-19 [4] [5] [6] , and imaging studies describe residual pulmonary abnormalities in a subset of patients after recovery from COVID-19 [7, 8] . Known risk factors for development of pulmonary fibrosis after COVID-19 include age, development of ARDS, and need for mechanical ventilation [5] . Pulmonary fibrosis is not well described as a complication of less severe COVID-19. Some small-scale prospective studies have not shown development of fibrosis in mild-to-moderate cases [7] but larger studies are needed to capture rare but significant long-term sequelae of COVID-19. In an ongoing global pandemic, rare outcomes may have farreaching impacts.",

The patient's acute phase of illness lasted approximately 2 weeks, requiring only supplemental oxygen by nasal cannula. A subsequent negative SARS-CoV-2 PCR result suggested successful viral clearance, but the patient developed hypoxemic respiratory failure requiring months of ICU-level care. Serial CT studies demonstrated a progressive fibrotic change characterized by traction bronchiectasis and a pattern of usual interstitial pneumonia. Treatment with corticosteroids was associated with an improvement in symptoms, hypoxemia, and trajectory of fibrosis progression on chest CT. This is an unusual case of COVID-19 complicated by progressive lung fibrosis long after clearance of the initial viral insult, and represents an infrequent but important sequela of non-critical COVID-19.",

Proposed mechanisms include viral activation of pro-fibrotic pathways, direct cellular injury, cytokine-induced injury, mechanical injury, likely modified by age, genetic, and metabolic factors, but more research is needed [17, 18] .",
