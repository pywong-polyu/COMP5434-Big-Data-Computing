We find that restrictive policies are more effective in containing the epidemic but come at the cost of unnecessary large-scale quarantines. Policy evaluation through their efficiency and cost results in optimized solutions which only consider contacts longer than 15-20 minutes and closer than 2-3 meters to be at risk. Our results show that isolation and tracing can help control re-emerging outbreaks when some conditions are met: (i) a reduction of the reproductive number through masks and physical distance; (ii) a lowdelay isolation of infected individuals; (iii) a high compliance. Finally, we observe the inefficacy of a less privacy-preserving tracing involving second order contacts. Our results may inform digital contact tracing efforts currently being implemented across several countries worldwide.",

Rigorous restrictions such as lockdowns and quarantine have proven to be effective in many countries as a measure to curb the spread of COVID-19, limit contagions and reduce the effective reproductive number 2,4-12 . Many areas slowly started to lift the restrictions, but new outbreaks appeared again, arriving in waves as anticipated by several early models 13, 14 . An effective and affordable long-term plan is required, since the fraction of the population that has been infected is still far too low to provide herd immunity 3 .",

Traditional manual contact tracing, besides being slow and labor intensive [23] [24] [25] , is not able to entirely reconstruct close proximity contacts 26, 27 . Thus, technologies based on digital sensors have been developed to complement manual tracing.

We draw inspiration from the work by Fraser et al. 42 , recently adapted to the case of COVID-19 by Ferretti et al. 17 . These work models the pandemic evolution using recursive equations describing the number of infected individuals in a homogeneously mixed population, taking into account the evolving infectiousness of the infected individuals. The analysis is based on two effective parameters, \u03b5 I and \u03b5 T , to represent the ability to identify and isolate infected individuals, and to correctly trace their contacts, respectively. Assuming an exponential growth for the number of infected individuals (applicable in early phases of an uncontrolled epidemic outbreak) the authors studied how the growth rate depends on these intervention parameters.",

The proposed mathematical framework makes it possible to address our main goal: characterizing the efficiency of contact tracing. This can be quantified by \u03b5 T , which instead of being a free parameter can be estimated numerically, by observing how well the implemented policies enable to find the infected individuals. More precisely, we assume that a fraction \u03b5 I of infected individuals is identified at each time step. Their recent contacts are then traced and, according to the nature of their interaction, as we explain in detail in the next sections, some of them will be classified as \"at risk and thus possibly contagious\". Tracing is therefore strongly dependent on the ability to identify those primary infected individuals that caused the secondary infections, and we thus assume that \u03b5 T is proportional to \u03b5 I . Moreover, it is influenced by the actual ability to find the secondary cases, given the primary infected. This in turn depends on multiple factors, involving the spreading model, the definition of a risky contact, the app adoption, the Fig. 1 Infection rate scenarios. Growth or decrease rate of the number of newly infected individuals, assuming either that all the infected people can eventually be identified and isolated (a); or that only symptomatic people can be isolated with 20% of asymptomatic infected individuals (b); or that only symptomatic people can be isolated with 40% of asymptomatic infected individuals (c). Infection rates are reported as a function of the isolation efficiency \u03b5 I and the tracing efficiency \u03b5 T . In all the three settings the cases are reported with a delay of 2 days.

For this reason, we need a numerical model that takes into account all these factors and simulates the spreading, with isolation and tracing, in a population of individuals with realistic contacts. To this end, we make use of three different data sets of empirical contacts involving large groups of people, in a high school, in a university campus and in an office building. The variable \u03b5 T will be computed by counting, for each primary infection, the fraction of the corresponding secondary cases that are actually quarantined according to some contact tracing strategy, see Section \"Aggregation and parameter estimation\" for the details on the derivation of \u03b5 T .",

Each infected individual has a probability of being identified equal to \u03b5 I . When this happens, all the identified people are isolated, i.e., removed from the simulation, and their recent stored contacts are automatically traced (i.e., warned by the app). In order to avoid quarantining a large portion of the population, we define specific criteria to determine which contacts are at risk, and only the corresponding individuals go into quarantine. As the definition of risky contacts is made a priori, and as infection events occur stochastically, quarantines will not only concern individuals who have been infected, but also some who have been in contact but were not infected (false positives), while some other individuals who have been infected although their contact were not considered at risk, will not receive any warning by the app and thus remain outside quarantines (false negatives). Note also that individuals who did not adopt the app cannot be notified nor quarantined, and contribute either to the true or to the false negatives. This is schematically explained in Fig. 2 . Different policies to define the risky contacts will be delineated in Section \"Design of appropriate policies\" and their efficiency will be quantified by not only observing their ability in controlling the epidemic but also by their efficiency in minimizing the number of false positives, i.e., unnecessary quarantines.",

The reproductive number of COVID-19 can be extracted from the literature as being close to R 0 = 3 45 , while there is little evidence for the dependence on proximity and duration; we thus consider multiple possible infection curves corresponding to different combinations of \u03c9 exposure \u00f0e\u00de and \u03c9 dist (s s ), keeping R 0 = 3 fixed.",

The constraint given by R 0 requires to find a good balance between the two functions \u03c9 exposure \u00f0e\u00de and \u03c9 dist (s s ). If for instance we suppose that infectiousness is high even at long distances we should thus set \u03c9 exposure such that contacts are contagious only for long durations in order not to have a huge R 0 (e.g., the pink curves in Supplementary Fig. 1 ). Vice versa, if \u03c9 dist is adjusted such that only close proximity contacts are contagious, we should give more importance to duration and suppose that also short durations are at risk (e.g., the blue curves in Supplementary  Fig. 1 ). In Supplementary Note 1.2, we show the results of simulations in these different cases. We observe that for the controllability of the epidemics, the different types of infectiousness do not lead to significant differences. However, from the point of view of cost versus the effectiveness of the restrictive measures, different curves lead to different results. We discuss this point in Supplementary Note 2.1. Here, we choose for definiteness one of the obtained pairs of curves (\u03c9 exposure \u00f0e\u00de, \u03c9 dist (s s )) compatible with R 0 = 3, and we assume in the following that infectiousness is governed by these. They correspond to an \u03c9 exposure \u00f0e\u00de which reaches 90% infectiousness after 2 h of contact, and to an \u03c9 dist such that the contagion probability drops by 50% at a distance of 2.5 m, and by 99% at 7.0 meters.",

Figure 4 shows the distributions of RSSI and contact durations of the interactions contained in the CNS data set. Most contacts have a short duration and low signal strength, but long-lasting durations are also observed, with overall a broad distribution of contact durations as is typical for data on human interactions 55, 61 . The thresholds defined by the tracing policies determine the fraction of these contacts that can be traced by the app. Even slight variations in the tracing policy thresholds may strongly influence the capacity to identify the contacts corresponding to the highest risks of infection, as shown in Fig. 4 by comparing the RSSI and contact duration distributions with the infectiousness curves.",

In other words, as a policy becomes more effective in tracing actually infected individuals, it also leads to the quarantine of individuals that have not been infected but that had a contact classified as risky by the tracing policy. The maximal number of false positives is very sensitive to the specific policy, contrarily to the number of false negatives. In particular, it appears from the analysis of the previous Section, \"Digital tracing enables containment for moderate reproductive numbers\", that Policies 2, 3, 4, and 5 have a similar effectiveness to contain the epidemic and Fig. 6a shows that they yield similar numbers of false negatives, but their undesired side costs are different, as the broader definition of risky contacts produces a larger number of false positives. This highlights once more the importance of the fine-tuning of the chosen policy. Since balancing between these two effects may be non trivial, we plot in Fig. 6c the effectiveness vs. cost for each policy, showing that Policy 2 is favorable in that it achieves an almost maximal effectivity (small number of false negatives) at a very low cost (small number of quarantines). Figure 6d reports the average percentage of the population that had to quarantine in the simulations (increasing from policy 1 to 5) and the percentage of those were actually infected (decreasing from policy 1 to 5).",

This last involves in particular both the access to appropriate spaces and the economic feasibility of a temporary cessation of the working activity. Since each country has a different level of capacity to isolate individuals we considered several levels of \u03b5 I instead of prescribing a fixed setting. The delays in turn depend on factors of different nature such as the delay in reporting, the availability and response of the call centers and of the health authorities, the app-and app-backend-related delays, etc. The analyses reported here take into account a delay of 2 days in isolating infected cases (thus in tracing and quarantining their contacts). This realistic delay does not prevent the proposed policies from keeping the epidemic under control, which is possible under some conditions. However, we observe that a larger delay, even if only one additional day, leads to a completely different scenario (reported in Supplementary Note 3.2) where assuming R 0 = 1.5 and 40% app adoption, none of the proposed policies proves able to contain the epidemic, even for maximal isolation efficiency, and despite the higher numbers of quarantines, false positives and false negatives.",

In other words, achieving a rapid containment and a low number of false negatives requires accepting a high number of false positives. This stresses the importance of a fine tuning of the tracing and isolation policies, in terms of the definition of what represents a risky contact, to contain the social cost of quarantines. Let us observe that this last could be mitigated by testing the quarantined population and revealing the false negatives, thus translating the social cost in an economical burden due to swabs. Among the tested policies, those that appear to provide the best balance between effectiveness and cost are Policies 2 and 3, corresponding to considering as risky a contact longer than, respectively, 20 and 15 min, with distance shorter than, respectively, around 2 and around 3 m.

Hence, the complete data sets only provide access to part of the interactions of the involved individuals, which is useful to analyze contact tracing in specific environments but does not provide a full picture of a society, e.g., an entire city. This limitation is due to the current lack of larger data sets involving people belonging to different environments, which would represent the general interactions within the population of a city or a larger geographical area. In addition, the implemented policies have been necessarily tailored to the specific CNS data set, depending on the available values of RSSI supported by the used smartphones. Those might differ in actual implementations of DCT apps currently in use in different countries, probably relying on a more advanced technology. Nevertheless, we emphasize that even if we used the simulations performed on these data sets to obtain a realistic quantification of the tracing ability, the controllability of the disease is itself assessed by the general mathematical framework.

Additional refinements of the transmission dynamic could be obtained by accounting for aerosol transmission, adding a dependence from the environment characteristics, such as being indoors or outdoors, and the presence or not of ventilation. This factor could in principle be modeled by considering information on the (co-)location of the individuals, which is available for some SocioPatterns data sets 47 . Should new insights emerge in the way the virus spreads, these could be easily incorporated into our model. Finally, we model delays in the case reporting and thus in the isolation process, but assume that the quarantine notification of the traced contacts is instantaneous. This is reasonable and it is one of the advantages of relying on DCT, but two factors may introduce a delay: the app may check for at-risk exposures only 3-4 times a day, and the backend servers that distribute \"infected\" keys to the app often batches them before notification. The combination of these factors introduces an average delay of several hours (4-5 h) and a worst-case delay of half a day.",
