The widespread closures of service providers and industries have resulted in financial losses and increased the risk of unemployment, which certainly increases negative emotions for individuals (Van Bortel et al. 2016) . Likewise, health care workers and health service providers can become depressed due to fatigue while on duty. A study reported that high-risk health care workers, such as medical staff and ambulance workers, who treated infected patients showed increased depression and anxiety (McAlonan et al. 2007 ). Some countries that experienced this outbreak early on (China and Singapore) took steps in the form of emergency psychological crisis interventions for people affected by COVID-19. Psychological defences are a supporting factor for the recovery of COVID-19 patients. It is therefore important to encourage prevention of these mental health disorders.",

The government can help accomplish this by providing access to psychotherapy, which is able to provide counselling services in the community through teleconsultation using several online-based facilities/video conferencing platforms, such as Zoom and WeChat, or via phone for free. Technically, the government can provide a call center (assistance hotline) to facilitate services. The virtual platform will be very useful for patients who are infected and treated in isolation rooms, including those who are isolated at home, health care workers, and the general public who need information. Psychotherapy can provide reassurance to patients and help health care workers interact with and support patients. Mental health service development lessons have been implemented in China, where online mental health services were available during the initial COVID-19 outbreak (Liu et al. 2020) . Maintaining the confidentiality of participants data must be addressed.",
