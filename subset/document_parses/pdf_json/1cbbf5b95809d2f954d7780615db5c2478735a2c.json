Notwithstanding the hospital's strong team culture, inter-physician variability with regard to ethical reasoning and preferred strategies was exposed. All the physicians emphasized the importance of team-family interactions. Nevertheless, their strategies differed: (1) The proactive physicians were open to consider limitations of life-sustaining treatment when the prognosis was grim. They initiated ethical discussions, took leadership in clarification and deliberation processes regarding goals and options, saw themselves as guides for the families and believed in the necessity to prepare families for both best-case and worst-case scenarios. (2) The \"wait-and-see\" physicians preferred open-ended treatment (no limitations). Neurologically injured patients need time to uncover their true recovery potential, they argued. They often avoided talking to the family about dying or other worst-case scenarios during this phase.",

Both concepts lack meaning unless the goals of treatment are specified. In the early phases after an injury, treatment may be given to obtain short-term goals such as avoiding imminent death, obtaining physiological stabilization, optimizing conditions for potential recovery, minimalizing secondary injuries or complications, giving sufficient time to gather a firm decisional ground including time to follow the individual patient's response to treatment efforts. In the later trauma hospital phase the long-term goal gradually play the most important role. An open deliberation process weighing medical facts and clarifying goals, interests and values may reduce unresolved doubt and increase the quality of the decision made [9, 11] .",

Within the OUH neuro intensive care unit (NICU), severe traumatic brain injured patients are cared for by nurses and a highly specialized treatment team involving neurosurgeons, intensive care physicians and rehabilitation physicians. We interviewed senior consultants from OUH with extensive trauma care experience who were actively engaged in patient care. We recruited participants by e-mail to all senior consultants via the heads of the relevant departments, as well as by individual invitations. Our intention was to offer the possibility to participate to all, but we were eager to recruit the most engaged and experienced ones. By e-mail we provided background information in order to prepare the participants for the interviews. Participants were provided with definitions of futility and PIT, and they were asked to focus on the \"PIT cases\" which involve a dilemma and thus demand a balancing of different considerations [9] . Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 18 physicians who were affiliated with the NICU: 9 neurosurgeons (N), 7 intensive care physicians (I) and 2 rehabilitation physicians (R). We included all in order to maximize the sample diversity and because all these physicians, regardless of specialty, are main decision-makers with regard to level of treatment. Our focus was not on differences between specialties, but rather on similarities and differences within the group as a whole. Among the 18 interviewed physicians, 7 were women and 11 men. Their mean age was 53 years (range 38-73), and the mean length of experience dealing with sTBI patients was 14 years (range 6-30).",

It was based on the researchers' expertise, relevant literature and unresolved questions in prior studies by our research group on treatment-limiting decisions in sTBI [23] . The interview guide consisted of so-called items to be covered, see Table 1 . A list of items instead of fixed questions enables the researcher to employ the guide in a flexible manner. The interview guide was slightly adjusted along the course of the study, accordant with qualitative methodology [24, 25] . The opening question was: \"Please share your experiences and reflections regarding encounters with severely brain injured patients and their families, when you were in doubt about whether to continue, withhold or withdraw life-sustaining treatment. Please use real-life cases you have been involved in. How did you perceive the situation at hand, how did you reason and act?\" Open-ended questions were used to access descriptions in the physicians' own words. Probing was used to further explore the meaning of what was said. According to common understanding in qualitative methodology the data is co-created by the interviewer and the participants in the sense that the researcher's interviewing skills, attention and sensitivity during the interviews will influence the data collection [24] [25] [26] .",

Nevertheless, it seems like the wait-and-see strategy is anchored in a deep sense of humbleness towards the long recovery paths of neurological injuries, a non-judgmental attitude to quality of life after severe brain injury, and a sense of duty to ensure that all has been done to secure a best possible outcome. To this adds that most physicians have experienced recovery among patients assessed to be beyond rescue. They believe vagueness in prognostic language is actually helpful because it captures what can be said about what to expect [33] . To give advice and intervene faced with uncertainty is sometimes inappropriate or may not be the most helpful response. These physicians give weight to the acceptance of uncertainties and the value of giving space for a process to gradually unfold. The proactive physicians, on the other hand, put more weight on their responsibility to shape processes, not merely react to what is unfolding. They are open to consider different options-although they are also aware of prognostic uncertainty and the possibility of fallibility. In our opinion there are unanswered questions and underlying hidden issues behind these differences. Physicians do not always reveal what guides their ethical reasoning. What receives attention and is given most weight varies. Self-awareness and open ethical discussions are necessary [34] . Are the proactive sufficiently concerned about avoiding discrimination and protecting vulnerable patients and families? How is their proactivity appreciated by the family? Is it perceived as helpful or as a threat? The wait-and-see physicians' tendency to avoid sharing their moral doubt with the team and family members prevents open ethical discussion about the patient's best interests.",

All Norwegian hospitals have a clinical ethical committee (CEC) and Norwegian doctors find CEC discussions useful [48] . Our interviews reveal that involvement of a clinical ethics committee (CEC) is not among the mentioned strategies for resolving doubt among the neuro intensive care physicians. This is thought-provoking as sTBI cases involve ethically challenging patients. It is worth asking why such a service is not applied in this setting. CEC is meant to be a support in the making of decisions also to secure patient rights, especially since advance directives are so rare in Norway.
