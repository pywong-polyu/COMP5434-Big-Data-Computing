Although clinic-pathological features are well-described in lungs, the histopathologic features of gastrointestinal involvement in resection specimens are not well characterized. Herein, we describe in detail the clinicopathologic features of intestinal resection specimens in four patients with COVID-19 infection. COVID-19 viral particles by in situ hybridization and immunofluorescence studies are also demonstrated. All four patients were males, aged 28-46 years, with comorbidities. They initially presented with a severe form of pulmonary COVID-19 and showed gastrointestinal symptoms, requiring surgical intervention. Histopathologic examination of resected GI specimens, mostly right colectomies, revealed a spectrum of disease, from superficial mucosal ischemic colitis to frank transmural ischemic colitis and associated changes consistent with pneumatosis cystoides intestinalis. Three patients were African American (75%), and one was Caucasian (25%); three patients died due to complications of their COVID-19 infection (75%), while one ultimately recovered from their GI complications (25%), but experienced prolonged sequela of COVID-19 infection including erectile dysfunction. In conclusion, COVID-19 infection, directly or indirectly, can cause ischemic gastrointestinal complications, with predilection for the right colon.",

The receptor of SARS-CoV-2, angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is highly expressed both in GI epithelial cells and in liver (2) . Almost the entire GI tract, including the stomach, small intestine, and rectal epithelial cells express the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein and the ACE2 protein (3) . The SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein, which encapsulates the viral genome, is essential for SARS-CoV-2 replication (4). High levels of these two proteins in cells of the GI tracts of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients can explain the concomitant digestive symptoms, including diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain (3).",

Tissues were then deparaffinized and rehydrated with sequential 5-min incubations in xylene (three times), twice in 100% ethanol, and twice in 95% ethanol. Slides were washed three times, for 5 min each, with distilled water. Antigen retrieval was then performed in Tris-EDTA pH-9 buffer at 70 \u2022 C for 20 min in a steamer, followed by three 5-min washes in distilled water. Tissues were balanced with PBS for 10 min and blocked with 3% w/v bovine serum albumen (BSA) in PBS for 40 min at room temperature. Slides were then blotted dry, and antibody against SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein (clone GTX135361, GeneTex, Irvine, CA) was applied at a 1:500 dilution in PBS+3% w/v BSA for 1 h at room temperature. Tissues were then rinsed with PBS three times for 5 min under gentle agitation. 4 \u2032 ,6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole (100 ng/mL in PBS) staining was performed for 5 min in the dark at room temperature, followed by three 5-min washes in PBS under gentle agitation. Slides were then mounted with ProLong Gold antifade mounting media (Thermofisher) and stored in the dark until image acquisition. Confocal immunofluorescence images were acquired with a Nikon A1R confocal microscope. ISH assay was performed using RNAscope R kit and ISH probes according to the manufacturer's instructions (Advanced Cell Diagnostics, ACD, Newark, CA). RNA probe, in C2 channel targeting SARS-CoV-2 replicative RNA intermediate, was used to detect the replicating virus as red signal (nCoV2019-orf1absense-C2, cat. no. 859151-C2). RNAscope R 2.5 Duplex Reagent Kit (cat. no 322430) along with Human (Hs) Positive Control Probes for housekeeping genes PPIB-C1/ POLR2A-C2, (cat. no 321641) were used to assess the integrity of the RNA. Simultaneously, consecutive sections were probed with probes targeting dihydrodipicolinate reductase B mRNA of a Bacillus subtilis strain (DapB) as a negative control, (cat. no. 320751) to assess the specificity of the assay.",

            "text": "Our cohort included four patients aged 28-46 years with a mean age of 38 years. Three of four patients were African-American (AA); one was non-Hispanic Caucasian. All patients had comorbidities that included essential hypertension (HTN), diabetes mellitus (DM, insulin-dependent or insulin-resistant), and obesity (BMI 33.08-34.8 kg/m 2 ). All patients initially presented with respiratory symptoms, including fever, dyspnea, and/or flu-like symptoms which developed into acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) requiring intubation, ventilation, and critical care management. The length of time between a positive COVID-19 test and significant GI symptomatology and resection varied widely from 1 to 53 days, with an average of 21.5 days. GI symptoms occurred on a spectrum, beginning as constipation, abdominal pain, or a lower GI bleed before progressing to ischemia and necrosis requiring surgical intervention. COVID-19 infections were confirmed by the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA, determined by PCR. The patients were enrolled in a clinical trial of remdesivir. Despite the treatment, they subsequently developed complications, such as lower extremity deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary thromboembolism, septicemia with septic shock (due to Cutibacterium/Propionibacterium avidum), multi-organ failure, hypotension, pulseless electrical activity and encephalopathy. For all four patients, acute renal failure was a complication, and all underwent continuous renal replacement therapy. Furthermore, the course of their disease was complicated by the development of GI symptoms, such as GI bleeding in the form of hematochezia, as well as an ileus. All patients underwent CT scans of the abdomen and pelvis, which showed changes compatible with GI bleeding with various degrees of intestinal pneumatosis and bowel ischemia. These findings were corroborated by the frank ischemia, ulceration, cecal dilation, and necrosis encountered intraoperatively. Additionally, laboratory findings were remarkable for elevated C-reactive protein (ranging from 24.87 to 282.6 mg/L), d-dimer (ranging from 978 to > 20,000 ng/mL), lactate dehydrogenase (556-681 U/L), lactic acid (4.0-10.6 mMol/L), and troponin I (39-1838 ng/L). Most patients were also anemic (Hgb between 7.3 and 11 g/dL; Hct 22-33%). The three patients who expired due to the infection demonstrated the most dramatic clinical courses, with pronounced laboratory, gross, and microscopic abnormalities ( Table 1) . For all four patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by nasal swap PCR testing, there was colonic pneumatosis with or without ischemic changes for whom CT scans of the abdomen showed evidence of gas in the mesentery, or features suggestive of lower GI bleeding.",

In our cohort, not all GI specimens demonstrated findings of coagulopathy and ischemia, but all samples revealed changes consistent with pneumatosis cystoides intestinalis. While pneumatosis cystoides is commonly associated with bacterial infection, its pathogenesis is poorly understood and multifocal, and can also be attributed to mechanical and pulmonary causes (11) . In our cohort, those patients that underwent infectious work-up for gas producing bacteria were negative. Moreover, these patients were acutely ill, requiring repeated surgical intervention, intubation and ventilation. This suggested that the etiology of pneumatosis could be the result of iatrogenic trauma or manipulation increasing intraluminal pressure (11) , or the result of free air entering the perivascular spaces of the intestinal wall following alveolar rupture in the setting of pulmonary obstruction (12) ; the clinical significance failed to be elucidated. The pathogenic pathway of COVID-19 remains largely undetermined, and its relationship with the gastrointestinal findings remains a challenge. It is widely accepted that the viral infection results in microthrombi which can lead to ischemic injury; however, in the setting of critical illness, HIT, and intragenic interventions (ECMO) it is difficult to quantify the exact role SARS-CoV-2 virus plays. The clinicopathologic findings in our cohort caused us to consider the relationship between the ischemic enterocolitis and hypercoaguable state of our patients with COVID-19 infection; however, comparison with non-COVID associated acute ischemic bowels should be performed to further characterize and ultimately define the histopathological features of the virus.",
