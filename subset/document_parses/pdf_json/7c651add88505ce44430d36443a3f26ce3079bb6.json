For the time series analysis, we included again the 2,466 TB cases in migrants that had the date of diagnosis on the notification form.

Table 2 presents the results of the Prais-Winsten analysis, confirming the findings in Fig 4 . The TB temporal trend in migrants in Brazil was classified as increasing, with a 60.66% monthly increase (95%CI: 27.21-91.85), as were the clusters in the states of Amazonas, Roraima, and Rio de Janeiro, which also had their temporal trends classified as increasing (with monthly increases of 1.01, 2.15, and 2.90%, respectively).

The principal nationalities of migrants in these regions are Haitian, with a large presence in the work market, followed by Venezuelan, Senegalese, Bolivian, Colombian, and Bengali. Most of the immigrants leave their home countries in search of better work opportunities and better living conditions [15] . Contrary to immigration in Brazil in the 20 th century, consisting mostly of individuals from the global North, basically Europeans, in the 21 st century this migratory profile has changed, and now most immigrants are from the global South. This aspect is important epidemiologically, since most of these countries are heavily affected by TB [1] , so migration may contribute to the spread of the disease between these countries and thus make TB control more difficult. When analyzing migration from a gender perspective, it is important to note that most migrants are males, who tend to experience higher TB prevalence than females, as reported in the literature [21] [22] [23] [24] . Fig 1 shows that from 2014 to 2019 there was a major increase in migration to the Northeast and Central-West regions of Brazil, but the main regions reporting migrants with TB are still the South, Southeast, and North.",

We recommend further studies to better understand TB in migrants and improve the data quality, mainly for specific populations, allowing calculation of rates and potentially additional results. In addition, we highlight the possibility of crossing data from different sources, as we are talking about two issues that are heavily loaded by social stigmas, TB and migrants, so crossing between different data sources can minimize some biases.",
