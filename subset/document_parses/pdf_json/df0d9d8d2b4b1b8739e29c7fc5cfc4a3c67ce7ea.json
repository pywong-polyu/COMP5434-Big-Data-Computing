Human CoV (HCoV-229E, -OC43, -NL63, and -HKU 1) infections typically result in mild-to-severe upper and lower respiratory tract disease [3, 4] . SARS-CoV emerged in 2002-2003, causing acute respiratory distress syndrome with 10% mortality overall and up to 50% mortality among aged individuals [5] . Most recently, Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV) emerged in the Middle East in April 2012, manifesting as severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and acute renal failure. The virus is still circulating and has caused 136 human infections with 58 deaths (mortality rate, approximately 44%) [6, 7] . Phylogenetic analysis groups CoVs into 4 genera-Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus, Gammacoronavirus, and Deltacoronavirus-and for many mammalian CoVs, bats are considered reservoirs [6, 8, 9] . SARS-CoV is closely related to bat CoV (BtCoV) HKU 3 [1, [10] [11] [12] , whereas MERS-CoV is closely related to Pipistrellus BtCoV HKU 5 and Tylonycteris BtCoV HKU 4 [9] . However, the serologic and antigenic relationship between strains is unclear. Given the vast number of genetically distinct CoVs, well-defined serologic and virologic reagents are needed to rapidly track MERS-CoV and other CoV infections in natural populations and to optimize vaccine and therapeutic designs early in an outbreak setting, especially within and between phylogenetic subgroups.",

Vero cells inoculated with MERS-CoV isolates were harvested 12 hours after infection by means of Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) and were used to perform Northern blots [18] .",

To identify whether these mutations altered virus growth, we analyzed the replication kinetics of the 2 isolates in Vero cells and a continuous epithelial cell line, Calu-3 ( Figure 1A and 1B). Although the replication kinetics were slightly different between 2 isolates in Vero cells, peak viral titers were equivalent. In contrast, virus growth was markedly distinct in human Calu-3 cells and could have represented differences in strain-specific in vitro adaptation phenotypes or resulted from functional differences in the sensitivity to innate immune responses [20] .",

Similar findings have been reported with SARS-CoV, as well as with other known human and animal CoVs [13, 23] . Interestingly, serum from aged mice vaccinated with VRP S showed a 6-fold reduction in PRNT 50 titers (approximately 1:200), indicating that immunosenescence attenuates vaccine responses to MERS-CoV antigens, as was noted with SARS-CoV vaccines [13, 17] . Using serum from NA 01 patient, ELISA demonstrated high reactivity of the patient's serum to N and S antigens of MERS SA 1 expressed from VRPs ( Figure 2B and 2C). Titers of antibody against N protein in patient serum peaked 3-5 weeks after onset of illness (which occurred on 3 September 2012) and waned thereafter, but the antibodies were still detected up to 5 months after illness onset. Titers of antibody against S protein were consistent from 3 weeks to 5 weeks after illness onset, after which they remained detectable. Most importantly, patient serum collected on 16 November 2012 (which contained high titers against S protein) outcompeted the binding of mouse S antiserum to intact virus in a blocking assay ( Figure 2D ). These data suggest that different/overlapping epitopes are recognized by human and mouse antisera following virus or VRP-S infection.",

Platforms for generating well-characterized molecular reagents and recombinant viruses are needed to detect and control the emergence of new strains, especially early in an outbreak, before the development of type-specific serologic reagents and therapeutics. Here, we characterized the genome organization, subgenomic mRNA expression, and protein expression patterns of 2 isolates of MERS-CoV. Using alphavirus replicon particles and synthetic gene design, we assembled a panel of recombinant proteins from and donor antisera against phylogenetically distant alphacoronaviruses and betacoronaviruses to evaluate the antigenic relationships between strains and to inform vaccine design. MERS-CoV is a highly pathogenic respiratory CoV of humans, causing acute respiratory distress syndrome, with mortality rates approaching 44%. CoV primer sets were not successful in diagnosing the etiology of the Jordan outbreak in April 2012, demonstrating a critical need for paneled reagent sets of recombinant proteins and sera that allow for serologic evaluations of cases, contact cases, and asymptomatic infections, using Western blot or ELISA-based techniques [25] . This article is also the first report that describes the serologic characterization of MERS-CoV and CoV reagents. An advantage of the VRP platform is that it can also function as a vaccine vector, affording the rapid production of candidate vaccines against newly emerged strains [23] . Using SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV as models, we clearly demonstrated that S protein-based recombinant vaccines elicit robust neutralization responses in young and aged rodent models. Because VRP-S vectors against SARS-CoV protected young and aged animals [17] , we have developed a recombinant S vectored vaccine that could likely prove successful in preventing heterologous MERS-CoV infection in aged individuals, but this remains to be tested.",

As the 2 viruses have different passage histories in vitro, tissue culture adaptive mutations may account for these differences, as reported with many SARS-CoV isolates [26] . Alternatively, 29 amino acid differences have been described, most of which reside in the replicase polyprotein (Supplementary Figure 2) and may affect replication efficiency. In addition, the S glycoprotein of MERS Eng 1 differs from that of MERS SA 1 by 2 amino acids, L506F and Q1020H (Supplementary Figure 2) , which may account for the increased amount of the higher-molecular-weight form of S protein in MERS Eng 1 ( Figure 1D and Supplementary Figure 1A) . Recent studies indicate that TMPRSS2 likely plays important roles in viral entry by enhancing fusogenic potential through proteolytic processing of MERS-CoV S glycoprotein [22] . In addition, we identified a unique mutation, T1015N, in the MERS SA 1 isolate but not in the MERS Eng 1 isolate and showed that this mutation is responsible for increased in vitro fitness and for plaque morphology [20] . It is possible that the presence or absence of 1 or more of the S glycoprotein mutations in MERS Eng 1 may result in the slower growth phenotype in Calu3 cells.",

We demonstrate efficient expression of several CoV S and N structural proteins both in vitro and in vivo, resulting in robust serologic responses in vaccinated mice. Antiserum to VRP-S glycoprotein but not to VRP-N protein neutralized both isolates of MERS-CoV. Furthermore, we and others have demonstrated that vaccine-induced immunopathology observed after challenge is minimized in VRP-S protein-based vaccines, partly because of the T-helper type 1-biased immune response and high neutralization titers elicited by VRP vectors [13, 31] . Importantly, vaccination of aged mice demonstrated that immunosenescence contributes to a reduction in the magnitude of the antibody response to MERS-CoV S glycoprotein, an important point to be considered in candidate vaccine designs. To date, wild-type and VRP 3526-coated VRP-S vaccines represent one of the few vaccine platforms that functioned well in aged animals, in addition to recombinant subunit-based vaccines and poxvirus-vectored vaccines [21, [32] [33] [34] . In SARS-CoV pathogenesis, increased age-related susceptibility is linked to increased prostaglandin D2 expression; it remains uncertain whether increased prostaglandin D2 levels have contributed to reduced vaccine performance, as well [35] . Because we have not observed MERS-CoV replication in immunocompetent and immunocompromised mice, these vectors must be tested directly in primates [36] . The safety of the VRP platform has been demonstrated in high-risk human populations and immunosenescent nonhuman primates [27, 28, 37, 38] , and we believe that these vectors will be efficacious in healthcare workers and target populations infected with MERS-CoV.",

Similar studies showing strong conservation of cross-reactive epitopes between N proteins, but to a lesser extent between S proteins of the subgroup 2a CoVs, has been reported [39, 40] . Importantly, the pattern of serologic and antigenic relationship observed using the mouse antisera was recapitulated using the human antiserum to 4 different CoVs. Neutralization assays demonstrated little if any conservation of cross-neutralizing epitopes between S glycoproteins of CoVs within and across subgroups.

Although speculative, these cross-neutralization relationships suggest that at least 3 antigenically distinct CoVs could emerge from zoonotic viruses circulating within subgroup 1a/b, 2b, and 2c reservoirs and then simultaneously circulate in humans. These findings are evidence that vaccine design for any new emerging CoV should either focus on the development of chimeric S glycoproteins containing neutralizing epitopes from multiple strains within or across subgroups or on the development of new paradigms in structure-guided antigen design that improve the presentation of broadly neutralizing epitopes. Regions of S glycoprotein are interchangeable between CoVs within and across subgroups, rendering viable recombinant viruses [23] . Inclusion of N protein in such chimeric vaccines may broaden the protective response, although this remains to be tested using lethal challenge viruses. Such a vaccine might provide robust protection against several homologous and heterologous viruses within or across genoclusters.",

Because CoVs have demonstrated an accelerating pattern of zoonotic emergence since the 1980s [25, 41] , our data indicate that an appropriate diagnostic platform should include a large panel of phylogenetically distinct CoV S and N structural proteins, which must be validated using larger panels of antisera against other HCoVs in the general population. While molecularbased platforms like polymerase chain reaction and deep sequencing offer clear advantages in early detection of active infections, public health response platforms would be strengthened by the availability of recombinant proteins and subgroup-and type-specific antisera that can track subclinical infections, determine the prevalence of infection in populations, and identify hospital-acquired infections. A recent report identified subclinical cases of MERS-CoV infection through reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction, and the screen using the panel of recombinant proteins described here would have provided more-specific information about the presence of other CoVs in these cases [42] . The VRP platform we describe not only yields high-level expression of key recombinant proteins across the alphacoronaviruses and betacoronaviruses, it also provides the first candidate vaccine vectors with the potential to augment the T-helper type 1-based immune responses to MERS-CoV infection and to reduce associated immune pathology. The VRP 3526-associated approach is also applicable to improving the public health response to and the control of future outbreaks of other highly pathogenic emerging infectious diseases due to CoV in human populations.",
