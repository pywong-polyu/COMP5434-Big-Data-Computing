However, we unexpectedly found that during lockdown, the PM 10 concentration in Jakarta increased by 10.9% due to the southwest monsoon during the seasonal change in Jakarta. Among the five cities in Jakarta, East and Central Jakarta experienced the maximum improvement in their air quality, whereas North Jakarta had the least air quality improvement. To the best of our knowledge, this research is the first to study the effect of lockdown on outdoor air quality improvement in Indonesia using ground-level measurement data. The findings of the study provide additional strategies to the regulatory bodies for the reduction of temporal air pollutants in Jakarta, Indonesia, by restricting people mobility as a supplementary initiative.",

            "text": "The INRIX Global Traffic Scorecard (2019) indicated that Jakarta is the most congested city in Southeast Asia, ranks 2nd in Asia, and ranks 16th worldwide. The main source of air pollution in Jakarta is vehicle exhaust emissions, which account for 57% of the air pollution (Vital Strategies, 2019). During the implementation of PSBB, community mobility has changed, resulting in the reduction of traffic activity. According to COVID-19 community mobility reports (2020), the mobility to retail and recreational places, train stations, and workplaces dropped by 56.01%, 65.96%, and 46.73%, respectively, compared with those during the normal days (Fig. 2 ). Moreover, the congestion level in DKI Jakarta was reduced by 36% compared with the previous year (Tomtom Traffic Index, 2020). Better traffic condition can be observed in April and May 2020, during which traffic congestion declined by 42% and 38%, respectively. Jakarta is one of the largest industrial provinces in Indonesia. By the end of 2018, there were 1555 medium-sized manufacturing industries and 563 large-sized industries (Indonesian Department of Statistics, 2018) ; 35% of them were located in West Jakarta (dominated by food industries), 27% in North Jakarta, 22% in East Jakarta, 9% in South Jakarta, and 7% in Central Jakarta. The automobile industry has the highest gross output value in Jakarta, which is over 9 million USD. During the PSBB period, the automobile production sharply declined from over 100,000 units a month in January-March 2020 to only 21, 000, 2,510, and 17,689 units in April, May, and June, respectively (Indonesia Automotive Industries Association, 2020).Overall, the industrial sector in Indonesia declined by 7.75% in the second trimester of 2020 (Indonesian Ministry of Industry, 2020).",

However, we found a 15.9% reduction in the PM 10 concentration in Phase 1 and Phase 3 of PSBB, but the average was still higher compared with that during the pre-PSBB period. This result is non-linear with the fact that the road traffic and industrial exhaust emissions in Indonesia were the main contributors of PM concentrations as high as 46% and 43%, respectively (Vital Strategies, 2020). Even the increase in PM 10 concentration in Central Jakarta was among the highest, whereas the air quality monitoring machine is located in the roundabout that is usually heavy in traffic.",

The major reduction was observed in the CO concentration, in which Central and West Jakarta demonstrated a reduction of 64% and 50%, respectively. In DKI Jakarta, land transportation was the major contributor of CO emission, which accounts for up to 93% (Vital Strategies, 2020) . This finding is linear with the existing publications that demonstrated that lockdown and social restriction could slow down the transportation activities, thus improving the air quality (Mahato et al., 2020) . According to the data from COVID-19 community mobility reports (2020), the transportation activities in Jakarta during the PSBB period dropped to 66%. No significant improvement in the air quality was observed in North Jakarta. The concentrations of all the air pollutants in this city increased, except that of CO. In North Jakarta, where the sea port is located, the loading activities and flow of large vehicles continued as usual or were slightly restricted during the PSBB period. Large vehicles used to transport food, gas, and industrial tools and for export-import activities were still allowed to operate during the PSBB period. This may have led to an increase in SO 2 concentration due to the sulfur content of petrol and diesel (Lamarque et al., 2010) . In addition, two coal-fired power plants in North Jakarta were the reason for the increase in the SO 2 and NO 2 concentrations. During the PSBB period, the coal consumption for the power increased by 9 million tons (CNBC Indonesia, 2020). Moreover, it was reported that several manufacturers of sulfuric acid and aluminum sulfate in North Jakarta did not have an appropriate fireplace, thus mainly contributing to the air pollution in the city (Viva News, 2019).",

However, the large-scale social restriction (PSBB) is one of the solutions to decrease the air pollution problems in DKI Jakarta. For the long-term benefit, the government should improve the currently available public transportation and develop hybrid and more environmentally friendly technologies (e.g., green vehicles) for the public (Purnomo and Anugerah, 2020; Saari et al., 2020) .",

The increase in the PM 10 concentration in Indonesia was mainly caused by the road traffic and industrial exhaust emissions, which account for 89%. However, the ground-level measurement of the PM 10 concentration increased during the PSBB period. The increase in the PM 10 concentration during the PSBB period was mainly due to seasonal variation, in which the PM 10 concentration tends to be higher in April to October. The concentration of O 3 also increased, but it was expected due to its inverse relationship with NO 2.",

The large-scale social restriction (PSBB) can be adopted as one of the temporal strategies to reduce the concentrations of the air pollutants in DKI Jakarta and as a supplementary initiative to existing regulations. A permanent reduction in the air pollutant concentrations in a high-density area like DKI Jakarta needs to be achieved. Most of the published studies on the effect of lockdown on air quality changes were conducted in capital cities or urban areas, including the study on Southeast Asia conducted by Kanniah et al.
