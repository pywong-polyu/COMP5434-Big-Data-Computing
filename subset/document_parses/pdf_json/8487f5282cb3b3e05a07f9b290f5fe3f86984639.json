These behavioral changes are situations of interest to mental health professionals since they are used as a basis for performing assessments and interventions. In particular, social behavior changes can represent relevant indicators of mental disorders as individuals' sociability has significant implications for their state of well-being [5] . Social relationships' characteristics can represent aspects capable of protecting or contributing to the development of mental disorders. For example, there is evidence that social support is a relevant factor for mental health [6, 7] , since there is a higher likelihood of depression among people who do not have social support. There is also evidence that social isolation is associated with mental health problems, such as depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideation [8] . Moreover, social isolation imposed to reduce the rate of contagion by the COVID-19 coronavirus may further impact global mental health [9] . Therefore, symptoms of mental disorders can be externalized through changes in social behaviors, so characterizing a situation of interest for monitoring mental health.",

These approaches generally use retrospective reports of social experiences lived by individuals in their daily lives, in which memory time can be days, weeks, and even months. As a result, cognitive biases limit these methods, hence contributing to an incoherent exposure of the lived experience [11, 12] . For example, memory bias can prevent patients from reporting their feelings and behaviors accurately [11] . Social desirability bias encourages patients to hide or modify the truth of their reports to achieve socially desirable results [12] . The clinical context in which mental health assessments occur is also a limitation since it does not represent the patients' natural environment, implying a low ecological validity of traditional mental health assessment methods.",

The pervasive nature of these devices combined with a large amount of behavioral data from their sensors make ubiquitous computing a natural option to incorporate new system proposals for monitoring social behaviors related to mental health. Among the methodologies in this research area, the approach called Digital Phenotyping stands out. The term Digital Phenotyping refers to \"moment-by-moment quantification of the individual-level human phenotype in-situ using data from smartphones and other personal digital devices\" [14] . The goal of digital phenotyping is to learn and monitor patterns overtime that characterize behaviors of individuals (e.g., physical activities performed, their social interactions and mobility), based on context data derived from mobile, wearable, and Internet of Things (IoT) computing devices [13] . By using this concept, it is possible to create computational mechanisms able to perform continuous and discrete detection of individuals' social behaviors [15] . These mechanisms can integrate computerized systems of Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) and Ecological Momentary Intervention (EMI), which allow mental health professionals to collect daily behavioral information from their patients and perform interventions in their natural environment. These solutions contribute to the effectiveness of the treatment and provide real-time support to the patients' daily life.",

Specifically, our proposed solution detects the time intervals in which social activities habitually occur. The recognition of sociability patterns is performed for specific contexts (e.g., weekdays, rainy days, and weekends), which enables the identification of behavior variability in different context conditions.

These social behaviors were used to develop a statistical approach able to generate a sociability score, in which higher scores represent greater social engagement. Wahle et al. [26] monitors participants' involvement in device-mediated communication (i.e., call logs and text messages) to quantify their sociability. Additionally, this solution recommends social exercises based on information on the intensity of social activities, time and location. Lane et al.

This application calculates a sociability score by applying a linear regression on the total duration of conversations.

For this, we use a strategy with Context Attributes (CAs), in which several scales can be used to represent them. For example, a temporal feature may have several scales, as a broad scale, so differentiating days of week and weekends, or a more specific, so distinguishing each day of the week (e.g., Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday).

Therefore, routine change is recognized when a sociability pattern extracted from a data window at time t has low similarity to a pattern identified from the data window t + n. The proposed solution maintains the first identified sociability pattern (i.e., a reference pattern) until it finds a new pattern significantly different from the reference pattern, so allowing to identify changes that happen slowly, over a long period. Figure 3 shows the strategy for detecting abnormal social behaviors. To perform this task, the specialist (e.g., a mental health professional) is required to define the time window size that models an observation of the individual's social behavior in a given context (e.g., Mondays, rainy days, weekends). For example, in Figure 3 , an observation could be composed of a one-week data window, so requiring two observations to extract a consistent sociability pattern, i.e., to conceive a predictive model of intervals of the day in which the individual habitually socializes. Therefore, to recognize abnormal behaviors, our proposed solution uses the Jaccard similarity coefficient (Equation (4)) to compare the current sociability pattern with the social behavior of the next observations. Hence, if the similarity between the current pattern and the recognized social habit (i.e., an observation) has value below a threshold defined by the specialist, the solution sends an event to notify interested parties about the identification of abnormal social behavior. Figure 4 presents the strategy for detecting social routine changes. In this scenario, sociability patterns are extracted through a determined number of observations (e.g., two observations), which represent the current social routine of the monitored individual. In principle, the solution persists in memory the first sociability pattern identified, which is used as a comparison model with the next patterns to recognize significant social routine changes. Specifically, when the similarity is below the defined threshold, two tasks are triggered to: (i) update the current sociability pattern with the most recent routine and; (ii) notify interested parties by sending a social routine change event.

The specification of the change threshold is subjective, as it depends on the specialist's knowledge, and has an imprecise essence, since a rigid limit may not adequately model the change that has occurred. For example, consider that an specialist has configured the behavior change detection solution with a similarity threshold of 60%. In this scenario, if the similarity between sociability patterns is 59.9%, abnormal social behavior is detected even though it is very close to the specified threshold.

Another reason is the notation of defining fuzzy rules through linguistic variables (i.e., natural language) and logical connectors [49] , which presents semantics that is easy to understand for users. Therefore, we used fuzzy logic due to its ability to model expert knowledge through fuzzy sets and fuzzy rules and its notation that is easy to understand.

Therefore, the specialist should use FCL to perform this task. Code 1 shows a configuration example of the sensitivity sets using FCL, while Figure 5 shows their visual representation. The specialist divided the sensitivity input variable into three levels: low, moderate, and high. In this scenario, a certain level of intersection between intervals is observed, so representing a gradual pertinence transition. The specialist is also required to represent his/her knowledge through FCL to define similarity set partitions and their respective linguistic terms. Code 2 shows a configuration example of the similarity sets using FCL, while Figure 6 shows their visual representation. The specialist subdivided the similarity input variable into three levels: low, moderate, and high. In this scenario, intervals have an intersection level to model uncertainty. Code 2: Configuration example of the similarity sets using FCL. The third set to be specified is the drift, which is representing the FIS output, i.e., it models the occurrence of social behavior changes of the monitored individual. Code 3 presents a configuration example of the drift sets, while Figure 7 shows their visual representation. The specialist described three linguistic terms: no_change, moderate_change, and change. In this example, we used the Center of Gravity (COG) defuzzification method to determine the inference's final value from activated rules. jFuzzyLogic supports several fuzzification and defuzzification methods. Next, the specialist is required to specify fuzzy rules that guide the solution's decision. These fuzzy rules have the primary structure <condition> AND <condition> THEN <consequence>. The specified fuzzy rules form the knowledge used by the FIS to determine the final value of the behavior change inference. Therefore, based on fuzzy sets presented above, the fuzzy rules contained in Code 4 can be specified using FCL. At the end of the expert knowledge modeling process, the solution can detect social behavior changes considering uncertainty in this task. Specifically, the solution sends a JSON object that contains information such as date, context, similarity index, and the pertinence degree to each interval of the fuzzy output set. Code 5 presents an example of social behavior change notification considering the expert knowledge modeled in the previous cases. In this example, the output variable (i.e., defuzzification value) is \u224874.86, which is \u224865% contained in the interval that represents change and \u224834% in the partition that reflects moderate change.",

For this, we identified sociability patterns considering each day of the week as a CA (i.e., MONDAY, TUESDAY, WEDNES-DAY, THURSDAY, FRIDAY, SATURDAY, and SUNDAY), and we checked the predictive performance of sociability patterns when using different numbers of social observations to design them. We defined prediction performance as the ability of sociability patterns to explain and predict individuals' social routines. Figure 9 presents an example of scenario for assessing the prediction performance of sociability patterns using two observations. We performed this evaluation using one, two, three, and four observations to project sociability patterns, so allowing us to compare the predictive performance of each configuration. Each execution consisted of the following steps: (i) recognizing the sociability pattern with the number of specified observations (i.e., one, two, three, or four); (ii) measuring the Jaccard similarity index between the pattern extracted with the next social observations; and (iii) identifying a new social pattern from the evaluated observations to represent a new reference pattern.

From results, we identified that extracting the sociability pattern using only one observation resulted in poor predictive performance compared to other configurations. Extraction of social patterns with two, three, or four observations showed similar predictions. Therefore, we concluded that the most appropriate approach was to use two observations to extract sociability patterns since we could identify them in less time with predictive performance similar to other configurations. After quantifying prediction levels of the extracted sociability patterns, we measured stability of the social routine of the individuals who participated in this study. We calculated average similarity between one day and the subsequent day (Figure 11 ), i.e., similarity of the individual's social behavior between consecutive days. CAs considered each day of the week, similar to the previous experiment. In the end, we calculated average stability of the individuals' social routine, so allowing us to correlate this variable with prediction levels of sociability patterns. We performed a stability analysis of the individuals' social routines to recognize essential information to understand their social behaviors. Figure 12 shows the stability of the individuals' social routines (i.e., the similarity of social behaviors between days), so making it possible to identify that most users had social habits with stability below 40%. However, some users had more stable routines, such as u04 and u27. From this analysis, we expect that sociability patterns could explain and predict more consistently social behaviors of the more stable users and that present lower levels of predictions when applied to individuals with more unstable social routines.",

When analyzing these results, we can recognize that prediction performance of the extracted sociability patterns remains related to stability of the social routine in all evaluated CAs.

Figure 16 shows social routines of the individuals u27 and u04, in which each cell contains the number of social events in a given time slot of 30 min (t = 24 0.5 ). From this visualization, we can recognize an evident change in social behavior at the limit that separates the two users' data. In this scenario, we expect that the proposed solution would detect abnormal behaviors when starting to process data of the user u04 and recognize the social routine change. Additionally, the solution adapt to the new pattern, then providing a new sociability pattern capable of explaining and predicting the new social routine. Social event streams for the proposed solution were created from data of the selected users. After processing data stream, our solution detected social behavior changes presented in Table 2 . These results demonstrate that it identified abnormal behaviors and social routine changes precisely. Specifically, our solution identified a high similarity between social patterns and observations (i.e., similarity > 46.1%) while processing user data u27, so not representing behavioral changes. From the first observation of the user u04, our solution started to detect abnormal social behaviors, so recognizing the social routine change by extracting the first pattern using data from this user (i.e., 5th pattern). This new reference pattern remained consistent with the next processed social observations, i.e., the solution can efficiently adapt to data stream changes. ",
