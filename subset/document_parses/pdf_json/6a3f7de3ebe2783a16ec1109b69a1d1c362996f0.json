County-level cases, doubling times, and death rates were compared to four increasingly restrictive NPI levels. Socio-demographic, climate and mobility factors were analyzed to explain and evaluate NPI heterogeneity, with mobility used to approximate NPI compliance. Analyses were conducted separately for the US and for each Census regions (Pacific, Mountain, east/West North Central, East/West South Central, South Atlantic, Middle Atlantic and New England). A stepped-wedge cluster-randomized trial analysis was used, leveraging the phased implementation of policies.",

Longer duration of level 4 NPIs was associated with lower case rates (log beta \u22120.028, 95% CI \u22120.04 to \u22120.02) and longer doubling times (log beta 0.02, 95% CI 0.01-0.03). Effects varied by Census region, for example, level 4 effects on doubling time in Pacific states were opposite to those in Middle Atlantic and New England states. NPI heterogeneity can be explained by differential timing of policy initiation and by variable socio-demographic county characteristics that predict compliance, particularly poverty and racial/ethnic population. Climate exhibits relatively consistent relationships across Census regions, for example, higher minimum temperature and specific humidity were associated with lower doubling times and higher death rates for this period of analysis in South Central, South Atlantic, Middle Atlantic, and New England states.

Onethird of all reported cases and one-quarter of all deaths were in the United States. Public health interventions to reduce the spread of COVID-19 in the US varied in timing and level of aggressive measures undertaken. No official US policy existed to prevent COVID-19 transmission until January 31, 2020, when a presidential order blocked the entry of non-US citizens into the US traveling from China. The state of Washington declared the first State of Emergency (February 29), followed by California (March 4) and Maryland (March 5); however, many counties implemented restrictive policies prior to state action. For example, three counties in Washington (King, Pierce, Snohomish) and four in Arkansas (Grant, Jefferson, Pulaski, Saline) ordered school closings on March 12 vs. statewide closures on March 17; counties in Pennsylvania, California, and New Jersey closed non-essential businesses prior to the state; and counties in California and Idaho issued restrictions on mass gatherings before state policies.",

            "text": "Early action by counties was motivated by both the ability to legislate response and the multifaceted issues that impact disease risk at local levels. Such issues include racial disparities, with a disproportionate number of Black and Hispanic Americans reported to be infected or dying (1) (2) (3) , urban vs. rural characteristics that influence transmission and policy implementation (4) , and disease spillover from neighboring counties, which can be exacerbated by economic disparities and shared environmental risks (5) . There is growing consensus that SARS-CoV-2 is an airborne pathogen, spread primarily through respiratory aerosols (6) (7) (8) that can be influenced by both microand macro-environments. Much work has focused on indoor micro-environments to help understand superspreading events, such as in restaurants, call centers, and large social gatherings (9) (10) (11) . The relationship between COVID-19 transmission and macro-environmental factors is more difficult, with early work evaluating relative humidity (RH), temperature, and UV exposure; however, findings have varied with some studies finding no effect (12) , inverse relationships (13) , or mixed effects (14, 15) . Elevated humidity has been associated with an increase in organic aerosols and higher levels of small particulate air pollutants (PM2.5, PM10, and O 3 ) (16, 17) , which have been correlated with transmission (18, 19) ; however, the simultaneous use of RH and temperature in models of viral respiratory illness is not recommended due to their direct functional relationship (20) .",

            "text": "Among other factors, the absence of vaccines during the COVID-19's first wave resulted in the application of nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPI, also known as community mitigation strategies) to control COVID-19. Unfortunately, without a randomized trial to quantify the effect size of NPIs or the potential causes of heterogeneity across different regions of the US, policymakers relied on modeling studies and early evidence from Asia to guide decisions. These included susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR) models attempting to quantify the effects of isolation and contact tracing (21) and how varying NPI effectiveness may influence demands on critical care resources (22) ; and studies in Wuhan and Hong Kong reporting how strict interventions (i.e., quarantine, social distancing, shelter in place and active case detection) reduced the COVID-19 reproductive number (R 0 ) (23, 24) . Over the past year, several studies have attempted to quantify NPI effects, with a recent meta-analysis summarizing studies from around the world that quantified how various strategies helped contain COVID incidence (25) . In the US, the majority of studies trying to quantify NPI effects have focused on the state-level (i.e., state-level policies impacting state-level cases and deaths) (26) (27) (28) (29) . For example, White and Hebert-Dufresne (27) analyzed five state-level policy effects, finding that only restaurant restrictions significantly correlated with higher doubling times; Chernozhukov et al. (26) study four state policies using a structural equation modeling approach, showing important effects of masking, business closures, and stay-at-home orders on both cases and deaths; and Auger (28) studied the effect of statewide school closures on COVID-19 cases and deaths using a negative binomial interrupted time series analysis, finding a 62% decline in cases and 58% decline in mortality following school closure. However, these studies ignore county-level heterogeneity and restrict their analyses to a specific set of policies without considering the joint effect of two policies implemented simultaneously. Aggregating county-level data ignores important social determinants as well as the reliance on county governments by states to make essential decisions regarding policy implementation and enforcement that explain variations in NPI effectiveness (29, 30) . The most comprehensive county-level analysis to date in the US was conducted by Ebrahim et al. (30) , who found both widespread county-level variation in policies and identified business closures as having the most important effect on COVID-19 cases; however, this study was limited to just one-third of US counties and relied on the estimation of R0 rather than using reported cases.",

For discrepancies or missing county policies, we obtained policy dates in two steps: (1) searching the county's state government website for reported county policies; and (2) if state websites did not report county policies or if the county reported at least one COVID-19 case prior to the issuance of any state order, we conducted a systematic search of gray literature for each county's policies, focusing on county websites (if existent) and local news websites. We categorized 12 policies into 4 levels of disease control following the New Zealand alert system and Oxford classification (37, 38) : Level 1 (low)-governor declaration of a State of Emergency; Level 2 (moderate)-school closures, restricting access (visits) to nursing homes, or closing restaurants and bars; Level 3 (high) -non-essential business closures, suspending non-violent arrests, suspending elective medical procedures, suspending evictions, or restricting mass gatherings of at least 10 people; and Level 4 (aggressive)-sheltering in place / stay-at-home, public mask requirements, or travel restrictions. These levels are mostly cumulative, meaning counties tended to implement policies sequentially and jointly, for example, 67% of counties implemented almost all level 3 policies at the same time, while 23% implemented them within 7 days of their initial level 3 policy. Note that our initial analysis found no effect of the two federal policies blocking entry to the US for non-US citizens (i.e., from China issued January 31 and from Schengen European countries issued March 11) on COVID-19 morbidity or mortality propagation; thus, we classified them as the \"non-intervention\" period. Finally, NPI effects were measured up to 5 days after county reopening, defined as opening non-essential businesses (with capacity restrictions), allowing public gatherings of more than 10 people, opening public spaces, or easing shelter in place orders. All but 12 states entered some phase of reopening by May 29 and six states allowed counties to open at their discretion (CA, IA, MD, NE, OR, WY).",

Several studies have demonstrated the utility of mobility data as proxy measures of policy compliance (30, (39) (40) (41) . Using results from Nouvellet et al. (42) , we defined gradients of mobility decline associated with reductions in R0. A four-level variable for compliance was created, where non-compliance (level 0) was defined as a mobility difference from 2019 to 2020 of <15%, low compliance (level 1) as a decline in mobility of 15-30%, moderate compliance (level 2) as a decline of 30-50% and high compliance (level 3) as mobility declines >50%. We then summed the time-lagged 10-day compliance and divided by maximum compliance (30) to create a scaled measure, from 0 to 10, representing the average level of policy compliance over the past 10 days. A value closer to 10 indicates high compliance (low mobility compared to 2019), while values closer to zero indicate lower compliance (more mobility). We expect to see values close to zero prior to the initiation of polices and as policies were removed.",

In addition, we conduct an analysis on factors associated with policy compliance by comparing change in county compliance during the first 15 and 30 days of March to socioeconomic and environmental characteristics. Therefore, since we define compliance as a 10-day lagged sum of compliance, we fit two models to estimate factors associated with compliance change from March 1 to 15 (i.e., change compliance from April 21-March 1 to March 5-15) and change from March 1 to 30.

In addition, we observed that higher levels of policy compliance, as measured by changes in county-level mobility from 2019 to 2020, resulted in larger reductions in cases but lower increases in doubling time for these restrictive NPI. Analysis of NPI effectiveness across Census regions revealed strong variation across regions and within states.

Recent studies corroborate these findings and also highlight the importance of perceived risk, occupation, and local social pressures (52) (53) (54) (55) . Importantly, we find poverty levels to be the most important factor in explaining compliance, which was also found in other studies (52, 56) .

Results are also consistent with studies in the US highlighting the effect of shelter-in-place (5, 59) and closure of schools, restaurants and businesses (26) (27) (28) . However, in contrast to these studies, we combine multiple NPIs into an ordered grouping of policies that tended to be implemented simultaneously, thereby avoiding the potential biases in assigning attributable risk reduction to individual policies when their roll-out occurs concurrently with others. For example, 51% of counties had school and restaurant closures occur <2 days apart (level 2 NPI), and 55% initiated restrictions on mass gatherings and non-essential business closures within 2 days (level 3 NPI). It is very difficult, statistically, to measure independent policy effects in an observational study when those policies are implemented in such close temporal proximity.

For doubling time, we produced predicted estimates for each NPI adjusting for all covariates entered into the model (Figure 4,  Supplementary Figure C1) . These predicted doubling times adjust for all the observed heterogeneity across counties, demonstrating that policy impact is likely not continuous in reality, but achieves a peak after a certain amount of time. Overall, we report level 4 achieving peak doubling time after 40 days and 23 days for level 3. This peaking is likely associated with reduced perceptions of local risk and reduced compliance even when policies are still in effect. For Census regions, they all appear to reach a peak doubling time for level 4 policies with the exception of Middle Atlantic and East North Central, which tended to have less heterogeneity in policy compliance compared to other regions as indicated in Figure 2 . This plateauing of intervention effects remains an important area of research, which is tied to issues related to adherence, transportation, and racial and economic disparities. The timing of policy implementation may also have introduced heterogeneity across regions. We observed that states experiencing early cases (Pacific, New England, and Mid-Atlantic) had significantly longer gap times between case detection and NPI initiation than states experiencing their first COVID-19 case later. This difference in policy initiation time is likely due to non-coastal US Regions learning from experience of coastal regions to implement NPIs more quickly. Unfortunately, early response during the first wave, which proved effective, may have given policy-makers false confidence as 12 states reported case spikes on June 23 and 7 states reported highs for hospitalization (https://covidtracking.com/)-all but one of these states began removing social distancing protections by May 11 and all but four are located in Mountain, North and South Central regions.",

However, we are more confident in COVID-related deaths reported. Second, our measure of compliance is based on reduced mobility in countries, but not a direct measure of adherence. In some states, policy levels 3 and 4 were viewed as an affront to civil liberties. While the use of mobility data has been shown to be an appropriate proxy for compliance, studies focusing on smaller geographic units may be able to obtain more accurate data on compliance to measure NPI \"dose.\" Third, we do not look at individual interventions. However, this was a choice as the sets of NPIs are considered a more appropriate response than single interventions, which have never been employed historically without others. Finally, we would ideally be applying these methods to a randomized design, which is impossible for COVID-19.
