While research is ongoing on the transmission dynamics of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, it is important to come up with epidemic models that can describe the main stages of the progression of the associated COVID-19 respiratory disease. We propose an age-stratified discrete compartment model as an alternative to differential equation based S-I-R type of models. The model captures the highly age-dependent progression of COVID-19 and is able to describe the day-by-day advancement of an infected individual in a modern health care system. The fully-identified model for Switzerland not only predicts the overall histories of the number of infected, hospitalized and deceased, but also the corresponding age-distributions. The model-based analysis of the outbreak reveals an average infection fatality ratio of 0.4% with a pronounced maximum of 9.5% for those aged \u226580 years. The predictions for different scenarios of relaxing the soft lockdown indicate a low risk of overloading the hospitals through a second wave of infections. However, there is a hidden risk of a significant increase in the total fatalities (by up to 200%) in case schools reopen with insufficient containment measures in place.",

A prominent example are the simulations performed by Ferguson et al. 3 which (among others [4] [5] [6] provided convincing evidence in favor of implementing strong non-pharmaceutical interventions in response to the COVID-19 outbreak. The S-I-R compartmental models 7 divide a population into groups of susceptible (S), infected (I) and recovered (R) individuals. Adding more compartments allows for a refined description of specific epidemics. Such models range from SEIR 6, 8, 9 and SUQC 10 models of COVID-19 to models as complex as the SIDARTHE 11 model which considers susceptible, infected, diagnosed, ailing, recognized, threatened, healed and extinct compartments. An important feature of COVID-19 is its highly non-uniform attack of the different age strata of society. Statistical analysis of data collected during the COVID-19 epidemic in Hubei 12 reveals that the infection fatality ratio for individuals older than 80 is likely to be one order of magnitude higher than that for individuals of 50 years and younger. Agestratified epidemic models are therefore particularly relevant when estimating the hospital load and fatalities related to COVID-19. Moreover, the age-dependent patterns of social contacts may be incorporated into age-stratified models. As a result, the obtained mathematical models provide not only estimates of the overall dynamics of an epidemic, but they are also able to predict the effect of age-dependent relaxation measures such as reopening school.",

Defining the first day of infection as Day 1, distinct sub-compartments are defined for all subsequent days until healing or death. The model is then updated on a daily basis by moving individuals to a specific sub-compartment for the subsequent day. Those moves are defined through shifting laws which account for the age-dependent probabilities of infection, admission to hospital, transfer to intensive care and death. As detailed in the Methods Section, the sizes of the compartments are set by the incubation time (5 days), the duration from the onset of symptoms to self-isolation (2 days), the average duration of viral shedding by asymptomatic individuals (8 days), the average duration spent in hospital (7 days) and in intensive care (8 days). In Fig. 1a , each encircled variable (E1, E2, etc) represents a vector whose components corresponds to the number of individuals in a certain age-group that are currently in a given sub-compartment (e.g. H2 for second day in hospital). In total, we symptomatic in self-isolation E1  E2  E3  E4  E5  A1 A2 A3 A4 A5 A6 A7 A8 symptom. infectious Supplementary Fig. 3 ). While up to 30% of the patients admitted to hospital will be transferred for age-groups 55 to 74 years, a significantly lower fraction of the individuals older than 70 years is transferred. The fatality risk in ICU (Fig. 1d) is estimated from the reported data after assuming that all deaths of individuals aged <75 years occur in ICU. Here, we observe a fatality risk of 40% in the age-group 70-74 years which appears to be low when compared to data reported for UK hospitals 16 . On the other hand, the canton Vaud reports that as many as 65% of all COVID-19 deaths occurs outside the hospital. We thus also allow for deaths of symptomatic patients in self-isolation with a probability of 2.3% and 7.3% for the age-groups 75-79 and \u226580 years, respectively. For the latter age-group, death is also assumed to occur in MCU with a probability of 18%. After setting the overall probability of deaths per compartment and age-group, a bump function is employed (Supplementary Information) to 5 determine the daily fatality risks (Fig. 1e ). Using the identified functions, the overall history of fatalities ( Fig. 2a ) and the age distribution of the deceased (Fig. 2b ) are predicted with reasonable accuracy. It is worth noting that about 70% of all COVID-19 related deaths in Switzerland are individuals aged 80 years or older, while the fraction of deceased is below 0.1% for those aged <50 years. The age-dependency of the probability of hospitalization for symptomatic individuals (Fig. 1b) is estimated based on the reported age-distribution in hospital.",

In other words, there would be less pressure on the government to take additional corrective measures quickly than at the beginning of the epidemic in March. However, this reasoning only applies when focusing on preventing the collapse of the healthcare system. The increased width of the second peak also implies a significantly higher death toll. While the first wave of infections generated about 2,000 fatalities, the second wave could generate almost 5,000 additional deaths (Fig. 7d) .",

The public perception may be positive as long as the healthcare system can handle the load of ICU patients, while many would silently die until reaching herd immunity. In the current scenario, herd immunity would be achieved by the end of 2020 after infecting about 30% of the total population. To gain insight into the robustness of the model predictions, a Monte-Carlo analysis is performed where we introduced six multipliers to perturb the probabilities of (i) developing symptoms, (ii) hospitalization, (iii) transfer to ICU, and (iv) death in self-isolation, To achieve a more positive outcome of the release of measures, we redid the above simulations with reduced probabilities of transmission at school (Fig. 8) . It turns out that the overall reproduction number after reopening schools will remain below 1 if the probability of transmission (per contact at school) is reduced by 50%. In that case, a second peak could be avoided. Moreover, and probably most importantly, the excess fatalities associated with school reopening would drop from 5,000 * ( 1.0) school \uf062 \uf03d to less than 1,000 * ( 0.5) school \uf062 \uf03c . Any failure of maintaining the rate of transmission at school reasonably low would result in a substantial increase in fatalities within a few months to a level that is significantly higher than the annual total of fatalities associated with influenza (about 1,000 for Switzerland). Repeating the above simulations with the assumption that 95% of the workforce is physically present at work (which also increases the probability of transmission at work from 0.3 to 0.5) resulted in similar results ( Supplementary Fig. 5 ).

On March 13, the government then advised to stay (and work) at home, closed schools and banned most private and public events.

According to the model, the reproduction number (Fig. 3a) first decreases from 5 to 2.4 due to social distancing, before further decreasing from 2.4 to 0.7 due to the stay home policy and reduction of contacts at other locations.

Both elements are expected to improve over time which requires the constant updating of the model. On the data side, the combined antibody and PCR-testing of a random group of about 10'000 individuals (Supplementary Information) is expected to provide valuable improvements of the assumptions made regarding the probabilities of hospitalization and the fraction of the asymptomatic group.The transport and transmission of COVID-19 through children is also unclear at this stage. all age-groups (Supplementary Fig. 7). This result suggests that the risk associated with reopening kindergardens and elementary school might be worth taking even if (i) future research demonstrates that kids are as infectious as other age-groups, and if(ii) safety measures (such as wearing masks) at school are not implemented for those aged <10 years. The analysis of the multi-variate effect of the probabilities of transmission at school, work and other locations (Supplementary Information) revealed that effective protection measures at all three locations are crucial for limiting the total of fatalities. In summary, a new discrete modeling framework is proposed to capture the dynamics of highly age-sensitive epidemics and to evaluate the effect of social contact patterns on the load of hospitals and their intensive care units. The model architecture is specified to describe the COVID-19 epidemic before identifying all model parameters based on the data reported for Switzerland. It is demonstrated that the model provides an accurate description of the history and the age-distributions of the individuals hospitalized, in ICU and deceased. The obtained (low) infection fatality ratio of 0.4% for Switzerland is in agreement with the testing-based estimate for the German county Heinsberg 19 . The model-based analysis of the outbreak elucidates the highly non-uniform attack of COVID-19.It is estimated that the reproduction number for the mostly highly-infected age-group (15-20 years old) is up to five times higher than that of the least infected age-group (>80 years) which appears to be protected 'naturally' by the social contact patterns. Nonetheless, individuals aged 80 and higher make up for 70% of the fatalities as opposed to less than 0.1% for those below 50 years. Simulations of the threephase lifting of the soft lockdown in Switzerland demonstrate the need to reduce the probability of transmission at school (even when assuming an effective protection at all other locations) to avoid a second wave of COVID-19 infections. Given that the reproduction number is much lower during the possible build-up of the second peak in hospitalizations (as compared to the 14 first peak), there should be sufficient time for governments to take corrective measures in case they detect a significant increase in hospitalizations after relaxing the lockdown. Even though the second wave may not lead to a collapse of the healthcare system, it is still important to maintain the overall reproduction number always below unity to avoid the silent multiplication of the total number of fatalities. Most parameters and features of the detailed COIVID-19 model for Switzerland will also be highly relevant for forecasting the effect of lockdown relaxation measures in other countries. By constantly training the proposed epidemic model based on current data for several countries, it will also be possible to quantify the effect of government measures on the rate of contact and transmissions from real-life observations. This important insight will not only be relevant for managing the current COVID-19 crisis, but also improve the reliability of predictions in the event of future pandemics.",

The corresponding numerical values are provided in Supplementary Tables 1 and 2. Different from differential equation-based SIR-type models, there is no need to employ a numerical solver. After evaluating the algebraic equation (M1), the state of the model is updated by shifting the individuals sequentially from a first sub-compartment to a subsequent subcompartment (Fig. 1) while applying the above transfer functions.",

Also the probability of admission to hospital and ICU depends on the healthcare system and the local culture (e.g.Due to its high rate of infection per capita and the expected good mixing of infected and susceptible individuals in a small country, we chose Switzerland as a first example for",
