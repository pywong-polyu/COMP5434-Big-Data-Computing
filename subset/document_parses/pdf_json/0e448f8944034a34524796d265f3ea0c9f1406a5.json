Functional enrichment analyses exhibited that the host induced responses are mediated by innate immunity, interferon, and cytokine stimulation. Surprisingly, induction of apoptosis, phagosome, antigen presentation, hypoxia response was lacking within these patients. Upregulation of immune and cytokine signaling genes such as CCL4, TNFA, IL6, IL1A, CCL2, CXCL2, IFN, and CCR1 were observed in lungs. Lungs lacked the overexpression of ACE2 as suspected, however, high ACE2 but low DPP4 expression was observed in nasopharyngeal cells. Interestingly, directly or indirectly, viral proteins specially non-structural protein mediated overexpression of integrins such as ITGAV, ITGA6, ITGB7, ITGB3, ITGA2B, ITGA5, ITGA6, ITGA9, ITGA4, ITGAE, and ITGA8 in lungs compared to nasopharyngeal samples suggesting the possible way of enhanced invasion. Furthermore, we found comparatively highly expressed transcription factors such as CBP, CEBP, NFAT, ATF3, GATA6, HDAC2, TCF12 which have pivotal roles in lung injury.",

This phenomenon causes the hyperactivation and recruitment of the inflammatory cells within the lungs and results in the acute lung injury of the infected patients [17] . However, this illustrates one putative molecular mechanism of COVID-19, there are many other immune regulators and host genetic/epigenetic factors which can also play significant contribution towards the disease manifestation [18, 19] . This multifaceted regulation was also reported previously for other different coronavirus infections [20] . Hostpathogen interactions in different coronavirus infections can function as a double-edged sword, as these could be beneficial not only to the hosts but also the viruses [20] . Similar host-virus tug-of-war can also occur in COVID-19 which might be contributing towards the overcomplicated disease outcomes [21] .",

Even previously conducted studies using patient samples, animal models, and cell lines to explain the pathobiology of COVID-19 [24] [25] [26] lack a detailed comparison of the host transcriptional responses between different infection models as well as the different sites of the respiratory system that might provide valuable insights on the COVID-19 pathogenesis and disease severity. In this present study, we sought to discuss the host transcriptional responses observed in nasppharyangeal cells of COVID-19 patients. This trscriptional profile report is first such kind from South Asian region. Additionally, we reported the genome variations observed in the four SARS-CoV-2 isolates obtained from these patients. Finally, we illuminated the differences in host transcriptional responses in different COVID-19 infection models and further pursued to discover the putative effects of these altered responses (Fig. 1 ).",

High coverages and read evidence were observed for all the isolates across the whole genome of the SARS-CoV-2 (Fig. 2a) . This suggests that the sequenced genomes of these isolates are of high coverage and no such region is observed without the mapped reads. We detected sixty different types of variations within these four analyzed SARS-CoV-2 isolates (Table 1) . All the four different types of sequence variations were spotted in these isolates, however, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were the most prominent (Fig. 2b) . Among these variations, twelve variations were found in more than one isolate, whereas rest forty-eight variation occurred in only one isolate (Table 1 , Fig. 2c ). Among the isolates, isolate S3 contained the lowest number of variations, whereas isolate S4 has the highest number of variations (Fig. 2d ). Many concepts are there correlating the probable roles of variations with the COVID-19 disease severity [27, 28] . We did not observe any such variations within the spike region of our reported isolates; however, we recorded an unusual amount of 3\u2032-UTR and 5\u2032-UTR variations within these four isolates (Fig. 2c, d) . Surprisingly, out of all these variations, we found only one downstream gene variation on the 3\u2032-UTRs of all the four isolates; this variation can potentially impact the regulation of the ORF10 gene (Fig. 2d) . Most of the nucleic acid mutations were located on the 3\u2032-UTR of the isolates, whereas the ORF1ab gene contained most of the amino acid mutations (Fig. 2e) .",

From the sample to sample distance clustering, principal component analysis, and clustered heatmap of the count matrix with top 50 genes, we observed that gene expression profiles of our nasopharyngeal samples are more relevant to that of lung samples; whereas, high level of variance was observed between the gene expression counts of the cell lines and primary nasopharyngeal samples (Fig. 5b-d) .

Therefore, we sought to find out the expression profiles of integrin related genes in different COVID-19 infection models at sample level. RGD motif of the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 can bind the integrins and this motif is placed near to the ACE2-receptor binding motif [37] . Moreover, evidence of integrin domain binding was also reported for SARS-CoV [39] . Therefore, we sought to discover the expression profiles of the integrin related genes in different SARS-CoV-2 infection models. To accomplish this, we filtered out the integrin and integrin signaling related genes (Additional file 8) within the terms of the GOBP, KEGG pathway, and Bioplanet pathway modules that we used for enrichment analysis. Intriguingly, we observed that the genes related to integrins and integrin signaling such as ITGAV, ITGA6, ITGB7, ITGB3, ITGA2B, ITGA5, ITGA6, ITGA9, ITGA4, ITGAE, and ITGA8 were highly expressed in analyzed lung samples, and the lowest number of these genes were expressed in the nasopharyngeal samples (Fig. 6a , b, Additional file 9: Figure S4A ). Based on these observations, we can assume that overexpression of integrins and integrin signaling related genes in the lungs might provide the virus a competitive edge in invading the lung cells more efficiently compared to the cells of the nasopharynx and respiratory tracts.

We wanted to find out whether the genes related to cytokine signaling and inflammation have differential expression profiles in lung cells compared to the other infection systems. We extracted and compared the gene expression values of the genes related to these two terms (Additional file 8). We are not surprised to observe that the genes of these two major contributing events of COVID-19 lung pathobiology are significantly overexpressed in lung samples compared to the rest of the SARS-CoV-2 infected cell types ( Fig. 6c-f , Additional file 9: Figure S4B -C). Particularly, the analyzed nasopharyngeal samples have very low expression values for the cytokine and inflammatory signaling genes such as CCL4, TNFA, IL6, IL1A, CCL2, CXCL2, IFN, and CCR1 ( Fig. 6c-f ). Therefore, these observations are fueling the preexisting supposition of the roles of enhanced cytokine, and inflammatory signaling for worsening the disease condition in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infected lungs.",

Furthermore, Kuba et al. demonstrated the potential role of ACE2 in SARS-CoV induced lung injury [43] . So, we ventured to check the gene expression levels of ACE2 and the other entry associated proteins in the different SARS-CoV-2 infected cells. Surprisingly, we observed that the ACE2 gene was not expressed in high levels in lung samples as speculated (Fig. 6g) . However, gene expression levels of the other entry associated proteins were higher in lung samples (Fig. 6g) . Nonetheless, in few of the lung samples, the TMPRSS2 gene was not expressed in higher amounts (Fig. 6g) .

We then sought to figure out the specific genes and biological functions/signaling pathways which have this differential pattern. We achieved this by designing a multifactorial differential gene expression analysis using a generalized linear model (GLM) [44] ; in which we compared the fold changes of every differentially expressed gene in our nasopharyngeal samples and lung (GSE150316) samples, to discover how many folds lung is alternatively expressing the genes than nasopharynx in COVID-19. Firstly, we analyzed the suitability of the data for this design and observed no irregularities between the data used ( Fig. 7a-d) . Moreover, upon this multifactorial differential gene expression analysis, we observed an acceptable common biological coefficient of variation; this variation decreases significantly as the expression values increases (Fig. 7e) . From the MA plot, we observed a very high amount of the significantly (p-value < 0.05) several fold upregulated and downregulated genes in lungs compared to nasopharyngeal samples (Fig. 7f ) . We detected 807 upregulated and 298 downregulated genes in lungs compared to the nasopharyngeal samples (Additional file 10). Interestingly, we noticed the highly upregulated integrin and integrin signaling genes in lungs compared to the nasal samples (Fig. 7g ) which are consistent with our previous observations. Modulatory roles of integrins are well established in acute lung damages [45] . Similarly, aberrant expression of genes involved in integrin signaling can also provoke acute lung injuries, namely-ADAM15 [46] , SDC1 [47] , CD14 [48] , CD47 [49] , CD9 [50] , HMGB1 [51] , ITA6 [52] , and ITAV [53] . Therefore, SARS-CoV-2 infection induced deregulation of these genes might be contributing towards the worsening of the normal pathobiology and functionality of lungs in COVID-19.",

These enrichment analyses revealed that biological functions such as viral process, and antigen processing and presentation were highly upregulated, function such as regulation of gene silencing by miRNA was found downregulated in lungs compared to the nasopharyngeal cells (Fig. 8a) . Furthermore, pathways that provide antiviral immunity such as apoptosis, phagosome, antigen processing and presentation, adaptive immune system, innate immune system, interferon signaling, different interleukin signaling, and cytokine signaling in immune system were highly upregulated in lungs compared to the nasopharyngeal samples (Fig. 8b-d) . Despite having the antiviral protective roles, hyperactivity from these pathways can significantly worsen the COVID-19 patient's overall lung functionality which can be further complicated with progressive and permanent lung damage. Previously, it was reported that transcription factors can contribute to many inflammatory lung diseases [54, 55] which have similar lung characteristics observed in COVID-19. In this context, we identified the highly expressed transcription factors in lungs by comparing their respective expression values in nasopharyngeal samples (Fig. 8e ). Among these, transcription factors such as CBP [54] , CEBP [56] , NFAT [54] , ATF3 [57] , GATA6 [58] , HDAC2 [59] , and TCF12 [60] have significant roles in lung's overall functionality, acute lung injury and antiviral response mechanism in lungs.",

Only 51 genes of those proteins are found deregulated in our nasopharyngeal samples (Fig. 9a) . We then constructed a network interlinking the virus-host protein-protein interaction data from Gordon et al. [21] along with the deregulated genes from the nasopharyngeal samples (Fig. 9b) .

From this constructed network, we observed that viral proteins such as ORF10, N, ORF9b, NSP7, NSP15, NSP5, M, NSP13, NSP2, NSP9, ORF8, ORF9c, NSP12, and NSP1 can directly or indirectly interact with the differentially expressed genes in lungs (Fig. 9c) , suggesting the putative mechanism behind the deregulated integrin signaling to promote the viral invasion in lungs (Fig. 10 ).",

Moreover, we also observed a stimulated innate immune response in our patients which was also reported for other COVID-19 patients [62] . Astoundingly, important signaling pathways those elicit antiviral immune responses such as apoptosis [20] , phagosome formation [63] , antigen processing and presentation [64] , Natural killer cell mediated cytotoxicity [65] , and Toll-like receptor signaling [66] were found downregulated in these COVID-19 patients.

Surprisingly, upon the gene expression comparison between the different SARS-CoV-2 infected cells, we observed several folds upregulated expressions of genes encoding integrins in lung cells. This observation could support the idea of increased viral infections in lungs might be happening due to the overexpression of these probable attachment proteins. Also, the network analysis suggests a probable mechanism of upregulation of these proteins by the virus itself by the putative interactions through its proteins.

We have checked the raw sequence quality using FastQC program (v0.11.9) [84] and found that the \"Per base sequence quality\", and \"Per sequence quality scores\" were high over the threshold for all sequences (Additional file 12). The mapping of reads was done with TopHat (tophat v2.1.1 with Bowtie v2.4.1) [85] . Short reads were uniquely aligned allowing at best two mismatches to the human reference genome from (GRCh38) as downloaded from the UCSC database [86] . Sequence matched exactly more than one place with equally quality were discarded to avoid bias [87] . The reads that were not mapped to the genome were utilized to map against the transcriptome (junctions mapping). Ensembl gene model [88] (version 99, as extracted from UCSC) was used for this process. After mapping, we used the SubRead package featureCount (v2.21) [89] to calculate absolute read abundance (read count, rc) for each transcript/gene associated to the Ensembl genes.",

For the differential gene expression analysis of COVID-19 affected lungs, we've taken the RNA-seq data from the lung biopsy of a deceased COVID-19 patient and the associated controls from the original study (GEO accession: GSE147507); and another set of data from five deceased COVID-19 patient's (initially all of them were hospitalized) lung autopsy and associated controls from the original study (GEO accession: GSE150316) (Additional file 11). Moreover, for the differential transcriptome documented for the cell lines, we used the RNA-seq data from infected cell lines and associated controls from GEO datasets GSE148729 and GSE147507 (Additional file 11). For differential expression (DE) analysis, we used DESeq2 (v1.26.0) [90] with R (v3.6.2; 2019-07-05) that uses a model based on the negative binomial distribution. To avoid false positive, we considered only those transcripts where at least 10 reads are annotated in at least one of the samples used in this study and also applied a minimum Log2 fold change of 0.5 for to be differentially apart from adjusted p-value cut-off of \u2264 0.05 by FDR. To assess the fidelity of the RNA-seq data used in this study and normalization method applied here, we checked the normalized Log2 expression data quality using R/Bioconductor package \"arrayQualityMetrics (v3.44.0)\" [91] . From these analyses, no outlier was detected in our data by \"Distance between arrays\", \"Boxplots\", and \"MA plots\" methods and replicate samples are clustered together (data not shown). We considered the genes upregulated which have a positive Log2 fold change value higher than 0.5, and those with a Log2 fold change value lower than \u2212 0.5 were considered downregulated.",

Isolate-wise variation information of the four SARS-CoV-2 isolates used in this study.Additional file 2: Figure S1 . A. Snapshot of Nextstrain data portal showing the phylogenetic relationship of two SARS-CoV-2 isolates used in this study. Isolates of this study are indicated using a red arrow. B. Phylogenetic tree of Bangladeshi SARS-CoV-2 isolates. Neighbor-joining tree using MEGA tools. Isolates reported in this study are indicated with a red arrow. The evolutionary history was inferred using the Neighbor-Joining method. The optimal tree with the sum of branch length = 0.01403419 is shown. The percentage of replicate trees in which the associated taxa clustered together in the bootstrap test (500 replicates) are shown next to the branches. The evolutionary distances were computed using the Maximum Composite Likelihood method and are in the units of the number of base substitutions per site. This analysis involved 145 nucleotide sequences. Codon positions included were 1st + 2nd + 3rd + Noncoding. All positions with less than 95% site coverage were eliminated, i.e., fewer than 5% alignment gaps, missing data, and ambiguous bases were allowed at any position (partial deletion option). There was a total of 29827 positions in the final dataset. Values represent bootstrap numbers (%). Additional file 11. Sources of the data used in this study.",
