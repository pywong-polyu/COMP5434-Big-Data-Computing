Both described the rationale for their preferred choice and the details of the procedure. These papers exemplified articles found in the \"Practice Forum\" of the then known Aesthetic Surgery Quarterly. The clinical relevance and desire to learn technical details made this section quite popular.",

Since this section's inception, we have had 23 articles published in ASJ, many of which have included video content. The evolution of My Way articles has been underpinned by the increased popularity (and availability) of video content and has created an even greater opportunity to learn the author's techniques in the explicit detail.",

We remain committed to publishing high-quality content and if we've learned one thing during COVID-19, it's that video, Zoom, and other online educational tools are the future and an excellent accouterment to traditional learning. 5 The Department of Plastic Surgery at UT Southwestern, where I have the privilege to serve as Professor and Chair of Plastic Surgery, has a long-established history of education and I have personally had the honor of working with some of the brightest residents and fellows in their earliest years. As their careers evolve and I watch them move from training into practice, present at national and international meetings, and begin to share what they've learned with the next generation, it gives me joy to see their professional development and evolution. In the same way, I am excited to carry the baton and help the My Way section continue to evolve in its new home, ASJ Open Forum, and I'm calling on you share your greatest learning moments so together we can pay that knowledge forward and continue this educational cycle.",
