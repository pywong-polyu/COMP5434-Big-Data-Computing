The immediate impacts of this are economic pains and infrastructural decay, but long-term effects include crawling pace of national development and loss of integrity in the global system. So, how does corruption affect politics and governance in Nigeria? This chapter examines the relationship between them and where it has positioned the country in terms of development and progress. Anchored on the argument that corrupt and other related acts would inevitably discount the gains of democratic governance, pollute the political space, create a spatial economy, and lead to a \"massification\" of the poor, this chapter posits that corruption has thrown spanners in the wheels of national development. The chapter also argues that the politics and government of Nigeria have suffered for too long in the hands of habitual and unrepentant treasury looters, political jobbers and beneficiaries of interminable orchestrations of scandals and frauds. It recommends that anti-corruption agencies should be answerable only to the judiciary, made up of persons with records of integrity, and led by a judge with a record of accomplishment, forthrightness and fearlessness.",

The leakages created by corruption probably explain the slow pace of development, as the adverse effect of corruption on national development can be phenomenal. This chapter examines the implication of corruption for governance in Nigeria since independence. It argues that corruption and other related acts would inevitably thwart S. Folarin (*) Political Science and International Relations, Covenant University, Canaanland, Ota, Nigeria e-mail: sheriff.folarin@covenantuniversity.edu.ng democratic gains, pollute the political space and create a spatial economy that will inexorably culminate in the massification of the poor. The chapter hinges its argument on the fact that corruption throws spanners in the wheels of national progress or development and that governance of Nigeria has suffered lack of accountability, transparency and honesty for too long. It is recommended that anti-corruption agencies should rather be controlled and answerable to the judiciary, be made up of persons with records of integrity and be led by a judge with a track record of forthrightness and fearlessness.",

Corrupt acts also include economic and financial crimes, nepotism, favouritism or discrimination and partiality in decision-making or allocation of values. Corruption thus represents degeneration from the normal, that is, an antisocial behaviour (Okojie and Momoh 2005:1) . By inference therefore, corruption goes beyond the narrow definition of the World Bank as the use of public office for private gain (Huther and Shah 2000) .",

Such other acts as immorality, dishonesty and perjury, though related to grand corruption, will be considered as petty corruption. Grand corruption is thus another term for public corruption, while petty corruption may refer to private corruption.

            "text": "(i) Political corruption: This is the kind of corruption that obtains in the three arms of government in a democratic rule, namely, executive, legislative and judiciary. Corruption at this level is the highest because it involves state fund. The issues of personal and primordial attachments in appointment, award of contracts as well as inflation of contract monies, embezzlement of funds and misappropriation of fund are critical examples of public corruption in the executive. The legislature in Nigeria has in recent times been in the news for high-profile bribery scandals (the Hembe-Oteh bribe scandal and the Farouk Lawan-Femi-Otedola bribery allegations are typical examples) in which the chairmen of the House of Representatives probe panels were indicted by the persons they were probing for demanding and collecting bribes from the suspects. The judiciary becomes vulnerable when it looks away from an obvious case of crime, tries to downplay the veracity of a crime or commits travesty of justice for a particular political interest. The Federal Court of Appeal has been in a state of crisis for sometime, leading to the suspension of its president on alleged complicity in election cases involving some western states which the president was said to have served the interest of a political party (Ketefe 2012 ). (ii) Bureaucratic corruption: Corruption here is still at the level of government. It involves the technocrats and civil as well as public servants who implement government policies. These include the leadership and personnel in ministries, departments and agencies (MDAs). The corruption at this level is the worst as the allocation, release and use of money is executed by these government offices. The staff are the ones that propose and submit financial needs of the units or projects, and they are the ones that transfer and effect payment.",

            "text": "Corruption becomes rife at this point. We have had cases of heads of ministries and parastatals busted and arraigned before competent courts and tribunals on charges of high-profile stealing and fraud. Bureaucratic corruption also manifests in favouritism and nepotism in appointment, promotion and reward systems in public offices. Some persons get rapid promotion and rewards on the basis of family, friendship, ethnic or religious affiliations to the boss, while some never get promotion because of such frivolous considerations. (iii) Military corruption: This was obtainable in Nigeria during military dictatorship. Ironically, the military was an institution that saw itself as a corrective regime in the face of bad leadership and festering corruption. That was the original intention of the army when they struck in January 1966. But we also know that the counter-coup of July 1966 was an ethnic-motivated coup meant to avenge the assassination of some persons of northern extraction in the first coup. With this mentality, professionalism that formed the fulcrum of the \"corrective\" notion of the institution began to fade out as corruption gradually crept in. By 1971, the military had become debased as all sorts of allegations were raised against General Gown's military ministers and state governors. It got worse with the Babangida and Abacha regimes which came under the spotlight as the two most corrupt leaderships in the country (TI, 2004) . (iv) Other forms of institutional corruption: The other forms of institutional corruption include that in the media and entertainment industries and even in the labour movement. The media is particularly known for the graft or \"brown envelope\" syndrome in which news reports are only publishable when certain individuals or groups in the story pay their way; or when an image polishing is done for those who can pay the reporter for it; or negative stories are stepped down when money has been paid to destroy such story. In the entertainment industry, persons for musical or movie auditions may have to \"sort\" or \"settle\" with money or sexual gratification to be given roles in films even when they are good or very bad. Labour groups are sometimes compromised by government not to embark on industrial action or to betray the cause of the movement by \"sorting\" labour leaders through the fattening of their accounts.",

            "text": "Corruption has been identified as a major challenge to national development in Nigeria (Seteolu 2004) . For the past 50 years or so, corruption has manifested in bribery, graft, treasury looting, subsidy and pension theft, over invoicing of cost of projects or contracts, money laundering, advance fee fraud, general indiscipline, favouritism and nepotism. The deep-seated nature of corruption and its drawbacks have earned Nigeria all manner of rankings by the eagle-eyed and whistle-blowing global corruption monitoring agency, Transparency International (TI), which once placed Nigeria as the fifth most corrupt nation among over 100 countries of the world sampled (T1 2005) . Despite the promise to combat corruption on before and after assumption office in 2015, the level of corrupt has remained very high under the current administration of President Buhari. To be sure, in 2019, Nigeria was ranked 148 out of the 180 countries rated by Transparency International. The corruption culture became so etched in the social life that certain catchphrases have entered the social lexicon of the country. These include \"sorting\" (2005-date), \"kleptocracy\" (1990s-date), \"settlementocracy\" (1980s to 1990s) and \"contractocracy\" (1960s to1980s). The embarrassing rate of corruption has continually brought Nigeria into global spotlight and made it feature in the news for the wrong reasons. This has led to the attempts by successive administrations to fight public and private corruption. Notable among these attempts have been Ethical Revolution by the Shagari administration, War Against Indiscipline (WAI) by the Buhari-Idiagbon regime in the 1980s, War Against Indiscipline and Corruption (WAIC) by the Abacha regime in the 1990s and the recent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Act of 2000, which birthed the ICPC (ICPC, 2006) , as well as the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission set up in 2002 by the Olusegun Obasanjo administration to tackle economic and financial crimes, including advance fee fraud (419), overt looting of public treasury and money laundering (EFCC 2002) .",

Their \"carrot and stick\" approach was itself manipulative and deceptive. It was not different from offering grafts in exchange for favours, which falls within our conceptual framework of corruption. The acquisition and establishment of colonies were fraudulent and questionable. In some places, they had offered \"protection\", sealed in questionable \"protectorate treaties\" that turned out to be outright scamming of local chiefs to let off their kingdoms without knowing it. King Jaja of Opobo had questioned the meaning of \"protectorate\", for which he was dethroned and banished (Alagoa 1980) . King Shaka of the Zulu kingdom had queried the real intentions of the European offer of military alliance and \"protectorate\" over the Natal Province, for which his kingdom was subsequently infiltrated with traitors even from Shaka's royal family, who eventually secured the alliance of the Europeans to tear the great Zulu kingdom apart (Golightly 2011) .",

The raising of Warrant Chiefs in eastern Nigeria during colonial rule was a probable attempt at deepening divisions in the Igbo society, while the extension of the tax policy to include women paying tax was considered a rip-off. Also, the use of Warrant Chiefs, use of persons from the Osu caste system as chiefs and tax collectors and the taxing of women were alien to traditional Igboland. But the deliberate introduction of this was considered by the people at the time as a means to defraud them and corrupt the system for self-interest (Columbia Encyclopedia 2012).",

There was also the scam of the $214 million national identity card project that involved the Internal Affairs Ministry and SAGEM. SAGEM had supplied new, fairly used and disused data-capturing machines for the 2002/2003 national identity card project at such a prohibitive cost. Yet the Ministry had declared that the machines were new, which brought the Minister to the spotlight as it was apparent that there was a collusion between SAGEM and the Ministry to defraud the government. The case did not however last long as it soon died out. Similarly, there was an allegation by some ministerial nominees in 2003 that the Senate screening committee demanded N54 million bribes to be given clearance (Fashagba 2009 ). There were also the Abacha loots that were traced to local and international banks (Jason 2006) . Government has continued to make efforts to recover the loot from various foreign countries. Recently too, there was an allegation that the Minister of Justice and the Attorney General of the federation under the Buhari administration had connived with the consultants handling the recovery of the Abacha looted funds to inflate the consultancy charges to the tune of several millions of dollars. No effort has been made by any of the government anti-graft agencies to investigate the allegation. This perhaps account for why many people believe that the much mouthed fight against corruption by the Buhari administration is a fight against the main opposition PDP and its members to weaken them.",

There was also the case of a serving Bayelsa State Governor, Diepreye Alamieyeseigha, who was accused of many charges, particularly that of multiple money laundering abroad. He was arrested in London and detained, but he jumped bail and escaped to Nigeria from London, only to be impeached and arrested by the EFCC for prosecution (ThisDay 2006) There has been the recovery of N640 billion and arrest of over 500 people in money laundering battle in the last 20 years. Other cases include arrest and prosecution of a Senior Advocate of Nigeria (SAN), Ricky Tafa It was discovered that part of the N1.6 billion ecological fund mismanaged by Plateau State Governor, Joshua Dariye, was donated to the ruling People's Democratic Party (Aiyede 2006: 50). The EFCC also uncovered the N50 million scandals involving a Minister of Education, Professor Fabian Osuji, in allocation deals with the National Assembly and the National Universities Commission (NUC), which eventually led to his removal and the illegal sales of government's landed property. This illegal sale and allocation of public estates declared for sale which was investigated found a Minister, Mrs. Osomo, culpable which led to her removal from office (Anwana 2006) .",

However, the fact that a former governor of Kano and another of Gombe were let off the hook of prosecution after conceding or jetissioning their political ambition that could negatively affect the ruling APC meant that government is aiding and abetting corruption in the polity. Many other corruption cases against members of the APC have been abandoned or discharged by the court due to \"lack of diligent prosecution\". Many former members of the PDP who were formerly under prosecution had their prosecution waived following their defection to the ruling APC as well. This is a clear case of politicization of the fight against corruption and perhaps accounted for why Nigeria continued to be rated as one of the most corrupt countries in the world by the Transparency International.",

There have been allegations of swallowing of over sixty million Naira at once by a snake in a national examinations body in 2018; squandering and alleged divesrion of N81.5b by the Niger Delta Development Commission between October 2019 and May 2020; the litany of allegations of corrupt practices against Magu, the acting EFCC chairman; and claims by the Federal Government of unsubstantiated spending of tens of billions of Naira for distribution across Nigeria as COVID-19 palliatives, among other obvious brazen corrupt acts (Morphy 2020) . Before 2020, the institutional weaknesses of the ICPC, EFCC and the Due Process Commission are the first set of brickwalls in Nigeria's fight against corruption. The institutions, by their acts of omission and commission, appear to lack complete independence. The ICPC is very slow to act and cannot, strictu sensu, prosecute, while the seemingly effective EFCC can prosecute but appears incapable of penalizing. The close affinities ICPC and EFCC have with the presidency that created them in the first place have made the two to appear like instruments of state coercion and victimization of perceived and real enemies of the civilian administration.",

Among those who were in the federal government's white list until they took side in the opposition camp in one way or the other are Tafa Balogun, Fabian Osuji, Alamieyeseigha, Joshua Dariye, Bola Tinubu, Orji Uzor Kalu, Mike Adenuga and more recently Ibrahim Babangida and Abubakar Atiku (The News 2006). The EFCC and the entire anti-corruption machine seem to overlook corrupt cases and corrupt persons and groups until they begin to oppose the president on his policies and personal decisions affecting governance (Jason 2006) . This brings us to the issue of certain ignored or \"closed\" or \"forgotten\" cases of alleged corruption. For instance, the allegations by Nasir El-Rufai, Minister of the Federal Capital Territory (Abuja), that two senators close to Obasanjo, Deputy Senate President Ibrahim Mantu and Senate Majority Leader, Jonathan Zwingina, asked him for a bribe of N54 million to secure approval for appointment (Dike 2006) appear consigned in the waste bin of history. Again, the whereabouts of recovered Abacha loots declared by the presidency since 1999-2000 are not known nor can what it has been used for be ascertained. Also, the $12.4b Gulf War oil windfall made under General Ibrahim Babangida's regime, which cannot be traced to date, is an obvious case of embezzlement that neither the EFCC nor ICPC has investigated or shown any willingness to take up. Moreover, there are also the copious cases of jumbo contracts, \"white elephant\" and abandoned projects between 1976 and 1983 that are no longer mentioned.",

From 2005, however, Atiku vehemently opposed President Obasanjo's third term bid which he considered as an obstacle to his ambition. Shortly, the relationship between the two collapsed, and soon after, EFCC and President Obasanjo himself laid charges of corruption against Atiku (The News: 20) .

There was the high-profile corruption case involving former Vice President Abubakar Atiku which led to hot verbal exchange between Obasanjo and Atiku in August and September 2006. The former President was openly accusing his Vice President, Atiku, of gross acts of corruption, including illegal transactions, bribery, fraud and embezzlement with the view to enrichment (The Sun 2006). This showed the leadership's culpability. The Obasanjo-Atiku episode opened a new vista in the corruption situation, showing the extent to which such governmental thievery and irresponsibility had eaten deeply in the national fabrics. Similarly, Colonel Dasuki, the National Security Adviser under President Goodluck administration (2010-2015), was alleged (and in fact locked up in jail for about 4 years) to have shared about $2 billion meant for the purchase of military equipment to fight insurgency in the Northeast to the members of the former ruling People's Democratic Party (PDP) during the 2014 and 2015 presidential electioneering activities. Also, Diezani Madueke, the Minister of Petroleum under President Goodluck Jonathan, was also alleged to have appropriated several million dollars of public funds for personal use under the watch of her principal.",
