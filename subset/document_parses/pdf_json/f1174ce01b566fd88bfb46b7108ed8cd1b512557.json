This study evaluated the effectiveness of universal SARS-CoV-2 screening in ICUs in terms of screened-out cases and reduction in anxiety of healthcare personnel (HCP). Materials and Methods: This prospective single-armed observational study was conducted in 2 ICUs of a single hospital. The number of patients diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection by the screening program and healthcare workers in ICUs that visited the SARS-CoV-2 screening clinic or infection clinic were investigated. Results: During the 7-week study period, no positive screening case was reported among a total of 142 patients. Among 86 HCP in the ICUs, only 2 HCP sought medical consultation for SARS-CoV-2 infection during the initial 2 weeks. Conclusion: A universal screening program for SARS-CoV-2 infection in ICUs with the coordination of other countermeasures in the hospital was reasonably effective in preventing in-hospital transmission in a pandemic situation and making clinical practices and HCP stable.",

The spectrum of SARS-CoV-2 infection varies widely from asymptomatic disease to severe pneumonia [2] [3] [4] . The community-based spread is estimated to continue at least over 1 year worldwide [5] . At the current stage of community spread, the risk of nosocomial spread is high, and the result would be devastating, with partial or wide shut down of facilities, which are already overburdened. During local SARS-CoV-1 outbreaks in 2003 -2004, the number of nosocomial transmissions also increased dramatically [6] . Moreover, asymptomatic or mild cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection are difficult to screen out by usual criteria [7] . SARS-CoV-2 infection is known to have overlapping clinical features with other respiratory infections; therefore, it is difficult to differentiate it reliably based only on clinical information [3] .",

Respiratory clinics were positioned outside the hospital and had the role of screening all patients with fever or respiratory symptoms to allow the patients within-the-hospital services. A dedicated COVID-19 screening clinic was run to address patients suspected of having SARS-CoV-2 infection and to collect respiratory specimens for the SARS-CoV-2 test [10] . Respiratory isolation rooms with a negative pressure facility were operated for patients with respiratory infections of undetermined etiology until the confirmation of the SARS-CoV-2 test. For the laboratory test of SARS-CoV-2, an in-hospital laboratory facility and outsourcing to a commercial laboratory to accommodate a potentially large volume of tests were prepared and operated. Regular newsletters regarding COVID-19related matters were issued to communicate internally with the hospital workforce.",

The number of COVID-19 tests performed in the respiratory/ fever clinic were 854 cases with a positivity of 2 cases (0.2%). During the study period of 7 weeks, there were 86 HCP working in the ICUs on a regular basis, excluding HCP from other departments working in the ICUs irregularly, and only 2 (2.3%) HCP sought medical consultation for SARS-CoV-2 infection only within the initial 2 weeks of the program. There was a total of 58 HCP who sought medical consultation for SARS-CoV-2 infection in the hospital during the study period, and the majority of them were working in COVID-19 wards. Among the 142 subjects going through screening for SARS-CoV-2 infection, 93 (65.5%) patients were male, and 103 (72.5%) patients were over 60 years old, with a mean age of 65.9 years (standard deviation, \u00b1 16.2 years). Chronic comorbidities were present in 96 (67.6%) patients; 46 (32.4%) patients had diabetes mellitus, 28 (19.7%) patients had a chronic heart disease, and 25 (17.6%) patients had a malignancy. The active problems on ICU admission were neurologic problems such as stroke and seizure in 38 (26.8%) patients, pneumonia in 26 (18.3%) patients and vascular diseases such as coronary heart disease or peripheral vascular disease in 15 (10.6%) patients. The indications for ICU admission were the need for mechanical ventilation in 28 (19.7%) patients, continuous renal replacement therapy in 9 (6.3%) patients, post-cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) care in 7 (4.9%) patients and postoperative care in 74 (52.1%) patients. Endotracheal intubation was already performed at the point of SARS-CoV-2 screening in the ICUs in 81 (57.0%) patients, and the major causes of intubation were type I or II respiratory failure, post-CPR care, and postoperative care. Abnormal findings on chest X-ray or computed tomography were present in 70 (49.3%) patients, and 31 of them showed patchy or reticular lung opacities indicating pneumonia. Leukocytosis, thrombocytopenia and an elevated CRP level were observed in 87 (61.3%), 24 (16.9%) and 93 (65.5%) patients, respectively ( Table 1) . Among the 142 patients, 64 (45.1%) patients without epidemiologic risk factors for COVID-19, new onset of fever or respiratory symptoms, and evidence of pneumonia were admitted to the ICUs directly from the ER on the same day as the initial ER visit, and 78 patients were transferred from general wards. The median time from initial hospital admission to ICU admission for the 78 patients transferred from general wards was 3.5 days (range, 1 -64 days).",

The urgent reasons to implement this program were, first, to cope with the real threat of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and, second, to ease the extreme anxiety of healthcare workers in the ICUs. Before the start of this program, we had already considered this screening program, but a consensus was not reached between ICU members due to the burden of logistics and the uncertainty of effectiveness without prior positive studies or governmental guidelines. However, there was a case of CPR and an uncoordinated order for the SARS-CoV-2 test in the SICU, which was preliminarily positive. At the early stage of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, we had two stages of screening and confirmation tests. With the preliminary positive result, a wide range of healthcare workers inside and outside the ICU were self-quarantined, and the ICU was temporarily shut down. The final confirmatory result was negative, and all the precautious actions were normalized. However, the overall process was so confusing, complicated and stressful that a full consensus to introduce a systematic screening program and counterstrategy scenario was reached to minimize the potential damage that could happen in ICUs in this SARS-CoV-2 pandemic period. If there were a truly infected patient, the damage would be to a much greater extent.",

In addition, no positive screening results for SARS-CoV-2 were found. There are several possible explanations for this result. As of April 17, 2020, there were 624 confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection among approximately 9,776,000 citizens in Seoul, where this hospital is located. This means that the pandemic density in this area was not very high. A relatively low level of infections in the community might contribute to a low chance of SARS-CoV-2 influx to the hospital. Another point to be addressed is that there were multiple barriers against SARS-CoV-2-infected patients entering the ICUs from the community. As described in the Methods section, we have multiple measures at each point of patient entry to screen out SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, the basic characteristics of patients in this study showed that the study subjects represented common ICU patients, and the majority of the patients still had the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection, considering the high proportion (45.1%) of direct ICU admission from the ER without SARS-CoV-2 screening and the short hospital stay (median 3.5 days) before ICU admission in the patients transferred from general wards. This means that the patients could be in the incubation period at first and show signs of SARS-CoV-2 infection after ICU admission.",

Sutton et al reported a universal screening in women who were admitted for delivery at a hospital in New York under the intensive pandemic; 15.4% of subjects were positive for SARS-CoV-2, and 13.5% were asymptomatic on admission [11] . Also, Al-Shamsi et al conducted a universal screening for COVID-19 infection in all asymptomatic patients with cancer before admission at the hospital in Dubai under the pandemic situation; 7 patients were diagnosed as COVID-19 infection among 85 patients [12] . Additionally, the optimal specimen for screening is unknown, but upper respiratory specimens are a reasonable option in view of the high SARS-CoV-2 viral load of the nasopharynx or oropharynx in the early phase of illness and lower respiratory specimens in the presence of lung lesions [13] .",

Third, there is further room for improvement. The subjects for the screening program may be further detailed according to their degree of risk. The facility of the ICU needs to be improved.
