            "text": "In this article, we consider a dynamic epidemiology model for the spread of the COVID-19 infection. Starting from the classical SEIR model, the model is modified so as to better describe characteristic features of the underlying pathogen and its infectious modes. In line with the large number of secondary infections not related to contact with documented infectious individuals, the model includes a cohort of asymptomatic or oligosymptomatic infectious individuals, not accounted for in the data of new daily counts of infections. A Bayesian particle filtering algorithm is used to update dynamically the relevant cohort and simultaneously estimate the transmission rate as new daily incidence and mortality data become available. The underlying assumption of the model is that the infectivity rate is dynamically changing, either because of a mutation of the pathogen or in response to mitigation and containment measures. The sequential Bayesian framework naturally provides a quantification of of uncertainty in model parameter estimates, including the reproduction number, and of the size of the different cohorts. Moreover, we introduce a dimensionless quantity, which is the equilibrium ratio between asymptomatic and symptomatic cohort sizes, and propose a simple formula to estimate the quantity. This ratio leads naturally to another dimensionless quantity that plays the role of the basic reproduction number R 0 of the model. When we apply the model and particle filter algorithm to COVID-19 infection data from several counties in Northeastern Ohio and Southeastern Michigan we found the proposed reproduction number R 0 to have a consistent dynamic behavior within both states, thus proving to be a reliable summary of the success of the mitigation measures. arXiv:2005.04365v2 [q-bio.PE] 21 May 2020",

In a little over four months it has evolved into a pandemic affecting nearly every country in the world in spite of the measures taken to control and contain the contagion. The novelty of the virus, which is related, but different from the coronaviruses responsible for the SARS and MERS epidemics in 2003 and 2009, poses a challenge to using mathematical models to predict the dynamics of the pandemic and the effects of changing mitigation strategies. Following the initial outbreak, number of contributors have either proposed mathematical models specifically designed to examine the spread of COVID-19 [1, 2] , or addressed important points related to the estimation of the key model parameters [3, 4] from partial, biased daily updated data [5, 6] and incomplete information about the pathogen responsible for the pandemic.",

Patients were tested when symptoms were mild or in the prodromal phase. Pharyngeal viral shedding was very high during the first week of symptoms, peaking on the fourth day, with shedding continued after the symptoms subsided, well into the second week. Moreover, most of the patients seemed to have passed their shedding peak in the upper respiratory tract at the time of the first testing, suggesting efficient transmission of SARS-CoV2 through pharyngeal shedding when the symptoms are mild. In [8] peak shedding is suggested to occur around day 0, and 44% of the transmission is estimated to occur in the asymptomatic phase.

One of the most used indicators of the potential for spread of an infectious agent is the basic reproduction number R 0 [9, 10, 11] , although questions have been raised as to how it should be computed [12, 13, 14] and interpreted [15, 16, 17] , and what can be inferred from it [18] . In general, R 0 > 1 signals epidemic potential, and the larger the R 0 , the faster the spread of the infectious agent. In [19] , where a SEIR model is calibrated and tested on the Wuhan outbreak data, the initial estimate of R 0 , whose definition and significance will be discussed later, was updated after the implementation of strict measures for control and prevention of the contagion. The model was then used to predict the magnitude of the pandemic by predicting the number of infected individuals on February 29, 2020 under the two different scenarios of an increasing R 0 , changing from 1.9 to 2.6 and ending at 3.1, corresponding to letting the pandemic follow its course, and that of a decreasing R 0 , going from 3.1 to 2.6, then 1.9, and eventually 0.9 and 0.5, following the mitigation measures taken in Wuhan.",

The model parameters, inferred from official data on the number of diagnosed and recovered cases, and fitted by recursive least squares methods, are adaptively changed during the simulation to reflect the introduction of progressively restrictive measures. More specifically, for the Wuhan outbreak the value of R 0 , set to 2.38 on day 1, is changed to 1.6 on day 5, increasing to 1.8 on day 12 and returning to 1.6 on day 22. After day 22, R 0 is reduced to 0.99, and from day 38 it is set to 0.85.

The model takes into account the travels of infectious individuals between cities by setting up a network comprised of 375 cities in China, with the amount of traffic between any pair of cities estimated from mobility data, and assigns fours separate cohort to each city. The estimator of the distribution of the six model parameters via a variant of ensemble Kalman filter suggests that in the first month of the Wuhan outbreak, only approximately one out of six infections was reported. The adoption of strong mitigation measures starting from January 23, 2020 is included in the model by first reducing the mobility coefficients to 2%, of the normal value, and by setting them to zero when all traffic stopped. The median latent period of COVID-19 in Wuhan according to this model is 3.7 days, and the median infectious period 3.48 days, with a median delay in case reporting of 10 days at first, and 6 days after the lockdown.

All parameters and outputs of the algorithm are easily interpretable and adjustable. The underlying model is an adaptation of the classical SEIR model [29] , adjusted to better conform with certain specific features of the current COVID-19 epidemics. In particular, we reinterpret the cohort of exposed individuals, defining it as individuals who carry and shed the virus asymptomatically, presymptomatically, or oligosymptomatically, thus not being isolated or hospitalized. Moreover, this cohort does not contribute to the number of confirmed cases. We refer to this model as SE(A)IR. We propose a Bayesian particle filtering (PF) algorithm for estimating dynamically the state vector consisting of the sizes of the four cohorts in the model based on a Poisson distributed observation of the infected cohort size, with the dynamic model generating the mean of the distribution. Concomitantly, we estimate the presumably dynamically changing rate of transmission with posterior envelopes of model uncertainty. Being a fully Bayesian algorithm, the output consist of model uncertainties. Moreover, we show the forecasting of the expected number of new infections based on the model with predictive uncertainty envelopes.",

Figures 6-7 show the predictions for the following 20 days for the four sample counties under the assumption that the mitigation conditions remain unchanged. In addition, we have run two alternative scenarios: In the first one, the last estimate of the transmission rate for each particle is multiplied by a factor \u03ba = 0.8, simulating a tightening of the containment and control measures, while in the second scenario, the transmission rate is increased by multiplicative factor \u03ba = 1.2, simulating a relaxation of the control measures.

In the Ohio and Michigan counties, we observe a rapid growth of \u03b2 at the beginning of the outbreak, followed by a clear and consistent drop. The initial increase may be due, to some extent, to the scarcity of the data in the beginning of the epidemics, and reflect the learning effort of the algorithm. The drop that follows, however, correlates well with the stay-at-home order and other social distancing measures introduced early on in both states, from March 16 to March 23 in Michigan, and from March 15 to March 19 in Ohio. In both states and across all counties considered here, the transmission rate is fairly stable, except for Wayne County, Michigan, where \u03b2 is slightly higher early in the epidemic. This may be the effect of a wider use of public transportation, socio-economic conditions and demographic factors. If the reason for the drop is the adoption of mitigation measures, it is natural to wonder why its onset is not the same in all counties. A possible explanation of the delay may lie in the fact that the infection arrived in different communities through the mobility of infectious individuals, and what happens earlier in large, densely populated areas affects the surrounding communities with a delay. The effects of the network structure on the timing and intensity of the COVID-19 spread will be addressed separately.",

We demonstrate a method for dynamically estimating the ratio of asymptomatic/presymptomatic/oligosymptomatic individuals in the E compartment to symptomatic individuals in the I compartment. This ratio, whose equilibrium value consistently settles to a value less than one across all counties examined and with a wide range of model parameters, is considerably lower than the 50-85 ratio speculated in [22] based on a serosurvey conducted in California on April 3-4, 2020. This disparity may stem partly from the growing availability of testing throughout April as well as the cross-reactivity in the ELISA tests used as part of the serosurvey. Understanding better this discrepancy will be a topic of future studies. However, we emphasize that while our methodology predicts that the asymptomatic cohort is typically smaller than the symptomatic one, according to the model, it is still responsible for the majority of transmissions. Furthermore, as already pointed out, the current SE(A)IR model does not address some of the features of COVID-19 transmission, including the latent period of the asymptomatic cohort. While designing a model that properly addresses the delay of the infectious phase of the asymptomatic patients is straightforward, retaining a structure that allows us to inform about the size of asymptomatic cohort based on data on symptomatic patients alone remains a challenge. Elaborating on that point will be a future direction of this research.",

In fact, while the value \u03b2 at the end of the considered time interval is nearly the same for all counties, the predictions on the new infections differ significantly. The main reason for this discrepancy is the different size of the cohorts. The numbers infected tend to increase strongly even if \u03b2 is relatively small if the pipeline of exposed/asymptomatic individuals is crowded. Because an unobservable concentration of individuals in the exposed/asymptomatic category may represent an uptick in future cases, only several days (preferably two weeks) of consecutively falling case numbers likely represents systematic decline in population-level disease activity. The uncertainty associated with undulating case counts is reflected in the wide predictive envelopes seen in projections for several of the Ohio counties. It is worth noting 10 day projections shown in Figure 8 tend to overestimate observed incidence in the last few days. We suspect this is attributable in part to reporting delays.",

Interestingly, the equilibrium value \u03c1 * and the corresponding R 0 are very consistent for a number of counties in two states, Ohio and Michigan, that adopted similar distancing measures around the same time, regardless of the fact that Michigan had a significantly higher number of infection than Ohio at the time of the adoption.
