            "text": "RNA editing is a relatively unexplored process in which transcribed RNA is modified at specific nucleotides before translation, adding another level of regulation of gene expression. Cephalopods use it extensively to increase the regulatory complexity of their nervous systems, and mammals use it too, but less prominently. Nevertheless, little is known about the specifics of RNA editing in most of the other clades and the relevance of RNA editing from an evolutionary perspective remains unknown. Here we analyze a key element of the editing machinery, the ADAR (adenosine deaminase acting on RNA) gene family, in an animal with a key phylogenetic position at the root of chordates: the cephalochordate amphioxus. We show, that as in cephalopods, ADAR genes in amphioxus are predominantly expressed in the nervous system; we identify a number of RNA editing events in amphioxus; and we provide a newly developed method to identify RNA editing events in highly polymorphic genomes using orthology as a guide. Overall, our work lays the foundations for future comparative analysis of RNA-editing events across the metazoan tree.",

Contemporary textbook examples of mechanisms that allow exquisite fine-tuning of this regulation are alternative splicing in vertebrates and RNA gene editing in cephalopods [1] [2] [3] . Both enable an increase of proteome and interactome complexity [4] without affecting genome complexity by addition of extra genes. In this regard, RNA-editing is a post-transcriptional modification that has not received much attention. It adds an extra layer of regulation at the translational level, as well as an increase in proteome diversity without changes in the original DNA sequence. In an RNA-editing event, a specific nucleotide of the RNA transcript undergoes a chemical change. This process transforms the edited nucleotide into a different one, changing the sequence of the messenger RNA molecule and thus, potentially modifying the amino acid sequence [5] . RNA-editing is present in all eukaryotic organisms [6] [7] [8] in different forms, such as the C-to-U (cytidine to uracil) editing mediated by the Apobec protein family [7] or the most prevalent in metazoans, the A-to-I (adenosine to inosine) editing, mediated by the ADAR (adenosine deaminase acting on RNA) protein family [9] .",

            "text": "Although increasing the levels of regulation and the diversity of the proteome has clear benefits, the evolutionary implications of RNA-editing are yet to be discovered. The role of the ADAR family itself is well known in vertebrates and cephalopods [10] . Its removal, for example, is known to be lethal in Mus musculus. Mouse embryos lacking ADAR will die before birth due to stress-induced apoptosis [11] and mice with null ADARB1 will become prone to seizures and die young [12] . In humans, one of its roles is the regulation of the innate immunity via the modulation of the antiviral response. In this case, ADAR would edit the viral dsRNA, which in some cases inactivates the virus. However, this also generates mismatched pairs on the viral dsRNA that dampen the interferon response, making ADAR in some cases a pro-viral agent [13] . Several studies have demonstrated how some level of conservation exists on the edited amino acid in vertebrates [14] [15] [16] ; however, since the mechanisms or the features that restrict editing to specific nucleotides remain unknown, we are not yet able to properly predict RNA-editing sites in silico. This is partially due to the difficulty of detecting bona fide RNA-editing events in enough species, which ideally requires the sequencing of both DNA and RNA from the same individual [17] . This is particularly challenging when dealing with highly polymorphic invertebrate species such as the cephalochordate amphioxus [18] . In this key evolutionary model for the invertebrate/vertebrate transition, and in many other less-established laboratory species, extracting both genomic DNA and RNA in sufficient quantities from the same individual may be difficult to achieve and the sequencing quality required for in-depth RNA-editing studies unaffordable. On the other hand, the study of conservation and changes in RNA-editing in key evolutionary models is crucial to understand if this regulatory mechanism might have had a role in generating morphological novelty.",

This yielded a total of 184,163 unique putative RNA-editing events within 23,406 coding loci (from a total of 35,959 coding loci) with a mean 7, 87 SNVs per locus where more than half (109,237~59%) would result in a synonymous editing. A complete GO analysis of the genes harboring SNVs can be found in Figure S1 . Focusing on tissue specificity, we selected the events appearing exclusively in one or two tissues and plotted them accumulatively relative to each tissue (e.g., tissue1, tissue1 + tissue2, tissue1 + tissue3, etc.). By this filtering, male gonads are the most enriched sample in putative RNA-editing events restricted to one tissue, while the gut is the most enriched overall. According to the expression data, neural tissue would be expected to be highly enriched in putative events, but surprisingly it ranked only in the 6th position. The tissue with the lowest occurrence of putative RNA-editing events was muscle. (Figure 3A ). During embryonic development, the number of putative RNA-editing events did not change significantly, with a discrete increase at 10-hpf ( Figure 3B ). ",

We thus performed an orthology-based approach (see methods) to better infer the genuine RNA-editing events, identifying the changes that were conserved between two very distinct species (in this case human and amphioxus). As the homologous amino acid position can vary depending on the quality of the alignment, we implemented a window of homology and tested it at size 0, 1, 5, and infinite amino acids of aligned distance between the two edited amino acids. As the window size increases, so does the permissiveness of the approach, yielding more putative orthologous RNA-editing events. In addition, we separated the events into the following classes: class 0, when the editing resulted in a synonymous change in both interrogated species; class 1, where both the pre-edited and the edited amino acids were conserved between the interrogated species; class 2, where the pre-edited amino acids were not conserved between the interrogated species, but the edited ones were; class 3, where the pre-edited amino acids were conserved between the interrogated species, but the edited ones were not; class 4, where neither the pre-edited nor the edited amino acids were conserved between the interrogated species (Table 1 ). All the putative orthologous RNA-editing events obtained using the different window sizes except the infinite window size are available in the Supplementary Table S1 . Interestingly, the tissue specificity for the different window size did not vary significantly except for the infinite window size, with gonads being the most enriched tissues in the other three window sizes (Figure 4 ). Table 1 . Classification of putative orthologous RNA-editing events within coding loci for each range used. An event can belong to more than one class depending on the isoform analyzed. A detailed list of selected class 1 events at window size 0 is also available ( Table 2) . We checked manually the quality of the alignments and whether the putative RNA-editing event was in a dsRNA for these events as ADAR proteins act on dsRNA. As a result, 30 events proved to have a good alignment quality with 9 candidates presenting both, a good alignment and the putatively edited nucleotide in a dsRNA region. This shows why a manual curation checking whether the alignments show conservation or have low quality and how is the secondary RNA structure of the gene at the SNV site was hereby needed as there can still be false positive events.

Specifically, editing targets were found in key mediators of synaptic transmission [16] . More recently, a landmark study reported that RNA-editing in cephalopods was extremely abundant in the nervous system, and in particular in genes involved in neuronal excitability and morphology [3] . In mammals, Adar knockout mice were shown to be embryonically lethal and mice lacking Adarb1 died in a few days after birth due to the lack of editing in GluR-B receptor [11, 12, 30] . According to our expression analysis using a published B. lanceolatum RNA-seq dataset [18] (Figure 1B) , Adar was highly expressed in the neural tube, whereas Adarb was found ubiquitously expressed at low levels in a variety of adult tissues. In vertebrates, however, Adarb1 was expressed more significantly in the neural and muscle tissues, Adarb2 was predominantly expressed in neural tissue, and Adar seemed to have a more pervasive expression [31] . Although a conserved microsyntenic cluster existed between amphioxus and human involving WDR37 and ADARB2, the tissue expression distribution seemed to not be conserved. It was remarkable how from the expected up to four vertebrate paralogs for each gene, Adar had only one ortholog without any clear synteny conserved with amphioxus, and Adarb had two, but one of them was enzymatically inactive. This could mean that an excess of A-to-I editing can be deleterious as very few organisms had more than two enzymatically active ADAR proteins [32] .",

Our results proposed that the amphioxus ADAR family might have a role in gene regulation during the development of the nervous system, as this was where these genes are most prominently expressed. This is congruent with previously reported ADAR-mediated editing in the nervous system of other invertebrates such as Octopus bimaculoides, and in vertebrates such as mouse or human. Altogether, this suggests that RNA-editing regulation might have been instrumental for nervous system evolution.",

The colocalization of ADAR paralogues with Elav and Prox1 at the mid-neurula stage suggests that RNA editing might play a role in neurogenesis in amphioxus. Interestingly, Takahashi and collaborators [40] demonstrated that the mRNA of Prox1, which can act as a tumour suppressor, experienced RNA-editing and loses tumour-suppressive functions in a subset of human cancers. This indicated that in the neural tube and muscles, where ADAR paralogues are co-expressed with Prox1, Adar may be editing Prox1, meaning that the edited isoform of Prox1 could have a role during the development of these particular tissues and cells.",

A single RNA-seq analysis will result in a mixture of RNA-editing events and the DNA polymorphisms of the samples used for the analysis. One way of reducing the noise caused by the naturally occurring polymorphisms is to find the SNPs present in the genomic reads used to build the genome and filter them out [42] , as we did to obtain the data shown in Figure 3 . However, not all the polymorphisms actually occurring in an amphioxus population will be present in the available genomic reads, and the RNA-seq and genomic data usually come from different samples, hence some of the putative RNA-editing events could be false positives and be just polymorphisms.",

Our approach of finding orthologous amino acids ( Figure 4 , Table 1 , see methods) resulted in a strict filter, yielding 1588 putative conserved events. After we implemented a window of homology approach, however, the permissiveness of the pipeline increased and this resulted in 6291 putative events at window size 5, with 405 of them belonging to editing class 1 events (Table 1 ). An infinite window size was also used to compare edited orthologous pairs without considering whether the edited amino acid was conserved or not. The tissue distribution of the infinite window size ( Figure 4D ), however, was really similar to the tissue distribution of SNVs ( Figure 1A) , whereas the three other window sizes had a more similar tissue distribution. As the process is done automatically based on orthologies, a manual curation is needed as shown in Table 2 with the selection of window size 0, class 1 events.

This method only required that data of RNA-editing exists for the reference species, and genomic and RNA-seq data is needed for the species interrogated.",

We used a genomic filter for countering the polymorphic amphioxus genome and detected 184,163 unique cases of A-to-G and T-to-C variants that are putative RNA-editing events in several adult tissues and during embryonic development. Finally, we developed a pipeline for the assessment of RNA-editing conservation in which the astringency can be adjusted, and widely used with any species having RNA-seq and genomic datasets available.",
