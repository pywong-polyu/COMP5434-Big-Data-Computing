Using thin-film PCR reaction tubes (e.g., Cepheid SmartCycler or glass capillary tubes), a 40-cycle RT-PCR reaction can be completed in as little as 12 minutes (2 minutes RT and 10 minutes PCR with 15 seconds per cycle). Compared to most benchtop thermal cyclers, this is a significant improvement in speed. While there was no real-time fluorescence detection during the run, the results of the probe-based RT-PCR assays were examined using the end-point PCR approach.
