The family can be divided into four genera: Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus, Deltacoronavirus, and Gammacoronavirus. In December 2019, in Wuhan City, China, scientists discovered a betacoronavirus that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome, coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which is similar to a virus found in bats. It can be transmitted by close contact between people through the respiratory droplets of an infected person [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] . Additionally, literature findings show that SARS-CoV-2 aerosol transmission is possible [7] .",

The fourth step is maturation, in which the viral content is made. Finally, in the fifth step, the viral content is released.

Approximately half (56.8%, n = 328) had a bachelor's degree. Approximately 35.7% (n = 206) were without a job. For further details on the characteristics of the study participants, refer to Table 1 . Table 2 below highlights participants' knowledge about COVID-19. The Ministry of Health was the main source of information for approximately two-thirds (68.3%) of the study participants. Approximately, 84.7% (n = 489) of the participants were aware that COVID-19 is classified as a severe acute respiratory syndrome. A majority of 97.4% (n = 562) of the participants knew that it was discovered initially in Wuhan, China. The same percentage of the participants knew that it causes viral infection. The majority of the participants identified that direct contact with an infected person, respiratory droplets, and touching contaminated surfaces are common causes of COVID-19 transmission. Approximately 62.0% of the participants were able to identify the symptoms of COVID-19 correctly, which are fever, dry cough, and loss of taste. The vast majority (96.2%, n = 555) of the participants knew that severe illness with COVID-19 is more common among the elderly and those who have a chronic illness. Approximately half of the participants (49.0%) knew that a distance between individuals of two to three meters is the method for the prevention of COVID-19 recommended by the MOH. Approximately half of the participants (48.0%) acknowledged that there is treatment for the disease. Approximately 40.0% of the participants were able to identify the appropriate duration for handwashing (40 s) and when using alcohol for hand hygiene (20 s). The majority (85.1%, n = 491) were able to identify that wearing a cloth mask is an appropriate procedure to decrease the risk of infection; however, only 4.5% of the participants were able to identify that smoking cessation decreases the risk of getting infected with the disease. Only one-third of the study participants were able to identify the proper steps for handwashing. Approximately 75% were able to identify the best method after sneezing and coughing to reduce transmission of COVID-19, which is covering the mouth and nose with a tissue and then washing one's hands. Additionally, the vast majority (84.6%) were able to identify conditions that require patients to isolate at home. Table 3 below highlights participants' attitudes towards COVID-19. Approximately 60.0% of the study participants reported that they stay at home to reduce the spread of the virus most days during the week. Additionally, 36.0% reported that they go out only in case of emergency. Only 11.4% of the participants reported that they have attended gatherings that include more than 50 persons. The vast majority (86.8%) reported that they avoid cultural behaviors such as shaking hands. The most common situations in which the study participants reported washing their hands with water and soap were after sneezing and coughing, before and after taking care of an infected person at home, and after using the toilet. Approximately 72.0% of the participants were able to identify the proper procedure if common COVID-19 symptoms appear, which is wearing a face mask, gloves, and seeking prompt medical care. In the case of visiting a clinic and receiving a negative result, the majority (75.9%) reported that they would adhere to the preventive measures that were advised by the MOH. If the result was negative and there had been previous contact with a confirmed COVID-19 case, approximately 60.0% reported that they would quarantine at home for 14 days.",

Approximately 62.0% of the participants were able to identify the symptoms of COVID-19 correctly, which are fever, dry cough, and loss of taste. The vast majority (96.2%) of the participants knew that severe illness with COVID-19 is more common among the elderly and those who have a chronic illness. Multiple factors might have contributed to the high level of knowledge about COVID-19 among our study participants. These include the high level of education and the young population [21] [22] [23] ; in our study, more than half of our study population reported that they have a bachelor's degree or higher and more than one-third had a high-school education. A good level of knowledge has proven to be a predictor for adherence to precautionary measures during pandemics [24, 25] . On the other hand, a lack of awareness and not having enough information about the disease leads to undesirable attitudes and practices, which ultimately leads to negative consequences for infection control [26] .",

Communication should be clear and target the whole community taking into account individual differences [30, 31] .

The vast majority (86.8%) reported that they avoid certain cultural behaviors, such as shaking hands. A positive attitude could be justified due to the proactive protective measures taken by policymakers in Saudi Arabia, which has helped markedly in controlling the spread of the disease, despite the large population in Saudi Arabia and the heavy traffic of visitors who travel to Saudi Arabia for religious purposes. Preventive measures have included suspending religious visits to the country (Umrah), lockdown, and restrictions on international and domestic flights, public gatherings, and face-to-face education.

This confirmed the findings of previous studies that were conducted in Saudi Arabia and Egypt, highlighting the positive attitude of the general public [21, 29] . This positive attitude has emerged from the general belief of the community in the effectiveness of the preventive measures that are recommended by the MOH, the WHO, and other leading bodies in healthcare in the prevention of the spread of the disease, which was reflected clearly in the epidemiological curves of the country [38] .

The use of social media platforms to recruit participants could affect the socioeconomic and demographic characteristics (i.e., having a higher proportion of respondents from one gender over the other or including a younger population) of the study participants, which may result in bias and could affect the generalizability of the study findings. Our study excluded participants who were aged below 18 years, therefore, we might have omitted an important group of the community who might have a different level of knowledge and attitudes towards COVID-19. The use of an online survey for data collection could have missed some of the targeted population. However, this has been common research practice during the pandemic as a previous study has documented that the use of online evaluation platforms during the COVID-19 pandemic has increased significantly and specifically for education and research purposes [41] . However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic and in order to minimize the risk of disease transmission, we preferred not to undertake any direct (in person) recruitment and to use social media platforms instead. A further consideration is that the data collection extended over a period of six months, which could have led to changes in the level of knowledge over the time period. Finally, some questions that explored participants' attitudes towards COVID-19 used a yes/no format. This type of question might affect the participants' responses and lead to social desirability bias; the participants might provide a socially desired response regarding their own behavior and attitudes towards COVID-19.",
