Along the lines of our previous work [Physica A 574, 126014 (2021)], here we apply 2D random-walk Monte Carlo calculations to better understand COVID-19 spread through contact interactions. Lockdown scenarios and all other control interventions are imposed through mobility restrictions and a regulation of the infection rate within the stochastically interacting population. The susceptible, infected and recovered populations are tracked over time, with daily infection rates obtained without recourse to the solution of differential equations.",

The simplest picture of epidemic growth is at most times provided by phenomenological models that are based on logistic growth [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7] . However, real-time interventions that may affect the trajectory of the growth curve are not incorporated in such models. More commonly, epidemiological modeling uses compartmentalized populations based on the SIR model [8] and its variants (see, for example [9, 10, 11]) that follow the time evolution of susceptible (S), infected (I) and recovered (R) populations, among others [12] . More often than not these deterministic models do not involve a stochastic formulation, which takes into account the random aspects of human mobility. Based on the early work by Bartlett [13] , such randomness can be incorporated through the equations [14, 15, 16] \u2202S \u2202t = D S \u2207 2 S \u2212 \u03b2SI (1)",

The D S,I \u2207 2 (S, I) 'diffusion' terms represent the spatial movement of both susceptibles as well as infectives. The parameters \u03b2 and \u00b5 represent the infection and recovery rates respectively. Such formulations have also been extended to biased [17] and L\u00e9vy [18] random walks. More recently, stochastic models have been developed using Markovian chains [19, 20] , contact and community networks [21, 22] , Bayesian modeling [23] etc. The effects of mobility restrictions have also been studied using Monte Carlo techniques [24, 25, 26] that inherently include the diffusion terms mentioned above. In most studies, the analyses that are solely based on single epidemic growth curves do not adequately explain the multiple wave structures seen in global COVID-19 data. For example, it was recently proposed that a superposition of epidemic waves [27] could be used to describe COVID-19 growth curves. However this does not describe the observed multiple waves of infection for individual countries, that are well separated in time.",

The effects of these interventions are visible as modulations in the infection rate. As test cases, we compare our simulation results with reported data from India, Serbia, South Africa and USA.

Briefly, people belonging to a region of population N , are described as points that execute random walks on a 2-dimensional plane. The speed of infection growth depends on the jump distance l for each point, which we assume is a multiple of the mean separation r between points. In Cartesian coordinates, the jump components are simply l cos \u03b8 and l sin \u03b8, with \u03b8 generated randomly between 0 and 2\u03c0 from a uniform distribution. Unlike other approaches [29, 30] , we do not consider a lattice or apply periodic boundary conditions. Instead, if a jump takes a point out of the area considered, it is reflected back into the system in a random direction. In all cases we consider particles in a 1 km 2 unit area element. Therefore we can use the words population and population density interchangeably. For N random walkers per unit area, r = 1/N in units of km. A separation distance of \u2264 2 m between individuals is taken as the 'contact' distance [25] .",

Given that these recovery times are evaluated after symptoms develop, a total of 35 days after infection is a reasonably accurate estimate.",

We note that a further intervention period from day 500 to day 600 (again with \u03b2 = 0.3) yields daily rates for the third wave that are in reasonably good agreement with WHO data. These results also show a clear fourth wave, whose position depends on the imposed intervention in the previous wave.

It is interesting to note that our predicted fourth wave is rather broad, similar to the blue curve obtained on assuming \u03b2 = 1 beyond day 500.

The country-specific growth modes described here occur between these two limits when there is sub-exponential behavior [9] due to the containment strategies employed. The power-law nature of the growth is lost for jump steps \u2265 3 r . On the other hand when the density becomes too high, since our simulations use jump lengths that are proportional to the average inter-person separation, the epidemic growth approaches the quadratic (lower) limit.

Instead, the focus is on the rapid time-shifted increase in the number of infections following intervention periods. These correspond to new waves of infection. On this basis the simulations are used to predict pandemic peaks at later dates, based on earlier data. If one chooses to use a calibration factor based on previously observed peaks, it is also possible to roughly estimate the total number of people infected.",

The model of independent random walkers as infection carriers in two-dimensional space is intuitive and shows promise in better understanding infectious disease outbreaks [25] . It is more accessible than other models and has the ability to capture random interactions that are missed through more conventional approaches. The simulations are shown to predict reasonably accurate disease trajectories in terms of secondary and tertiary waves, for COVID-19 data from four countries with vastly different features.",

Here, it should be noted that since \u2202N r /\u2202t \u221d N i , the peaks in N i roughly coincide with the daily infection rate peaks along the time axis. These simulated results are compared to scaled-down data from the World Health Organization (WHO) [34].This comparison is then used to infer if secondary or tertiary pandemic waves subsequently appear at later dates, due to the control interventions imposed in previous time windows. This is based on the premise that the control interventions and mitigation strategies would reduce the slope of the growth curve in the time duration that they are imposed (or followed). At the end of each such duration (when restrictions, mandates etc. are relaxed) there would be growth again. This effectively results in growth curves with multiple peaks in daily infection rates, that are shifted in time and interpreted as epidemic waves. We discuss a few country specific results below.",

These two structures contain in them all effects of interventions and mitigation strategies, including imposed lockdowns. We take D 0 to be April 22, 2020, with the first peak (D 1 ) around day 150 (September 15, 2020). Since this was the first country that we studied, we performed several simulations to better understand the general shapes of the curves, obtained for different parameter values. The first two sets of simulations used jump steps of l = 1 r and 2 r , with \u03b2 = 1. In the third set, we used l = 1 r from D 0 toD 1 and l = 2 r beyond D 1 . The fractional N i results for different parameter values and N = 10k are shown in Fig. 1. As evident in the figure, a larger amplitude infection peak is obtained when l = 2 r step sizes are used, with a peak value of approximately 0.45 around day 140. For this case the number of infections drop to negligible levels after about 200 days. In comparison, l = 1 r produces a broader and smaller peak that is shifted to a later date (near day 230). On the other hand, the l = 2 r and l = 1 r combination yields two distinct peak structures, as shown in the figure. In the next set of simulations we used this combination, together with \u03b2 values < 1 that account for intervention/mitigation strategies, which would lead to a drop in the N i fraction and consequently the daily infection rate. These results are also shown in Fig. 1, for different values of \u03b2 during the time period D 1 to D 2 (the falling part of the first curve), with the later date representing the beginning of the second wave. Beyond D 2 we assume \u03b2 = 1 for the rise of the second wave.",

Furthermore, the simulations also show no indication of a third peak that may appear on applying additional interventions (through \u03b2) in the second wave. This is supported byFig. 3, which shows the time development of the individual S, I and R components for these data. One can see that after day 500 N i drops to nearly zero, while N r saturates at \u223c 90%. It is apparent that at this point there are not enough infectious agents remaining to drive the curve and infect the small remainder of the susceptible population. This does not indicate a significant third wave. However, it may be noted that we assume all recovered individuals to be immune in our simulations. During the course of this work, several countries reported a surge in COVID-19 infections due to the emergence of the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant[35]. This variant is characterized by an unusually large number of mutations in the spike protein",
