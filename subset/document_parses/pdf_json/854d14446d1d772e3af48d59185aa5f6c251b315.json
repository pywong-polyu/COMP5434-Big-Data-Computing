            "text": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the cause of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID- 19) , represents a viral disease infecting millions of individuals all over the world and has emerged as a major public health emergency of international concern. Therefore, on 11 March 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic disease because of widespread infectivity and high contagion rates. Full-genome sequencing indicated that COVID-19 is a betacoronavirus in the same subgenus as the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus. The structure of the receptor-binding gene region is very similar to that of the SARS coronavirus, and the virus uses the same receptor, the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), for cell entry [1] . Direct person-to-person transmission is the primary means of transmission of SARS-CoV-2, mainly through close-range contact via respiratory droplets or by transfer to mucous membranes after coming into contact with contaminated surfaces; 2 and 12 days are the lower and upper extremes of the incubation period for COVID-19, with most cases occurring approximately 4 to 5 days after exposure [2, 3] . Several studies describing the clinical features of COVID-19 have been performed on hospitalized populations [4] [5] [6] . The most common clinical characteristics at the onset of the disease were fever (even lowgrade fever <38 \u2022 C), cough, fatigue, and dyspnea with typical bilateral infiltrates on chest imaging. Other features, such as upper respiratory tract symptoms, myalgias, diarrhea, abdominal pain, anosmia, and dysgeusia, may also be present [7] [8] [9] [10] . The spectrum of symptomatic infection ranges from mild to critical, with a proportion of severe or critical disease reported in approximately 20% of cases [5, 11, 12] . Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is the major complication in patients with severe disease and can manifest shortly after the onset of dyspnea [4, 12] . Other common complications include thromboembolic disorders, cardiovascular disease (e.g., arrhythmias, acute cardiac injury, and shock), an exuberant inflammatory response similar to cytokine release syndrome, and secondary infections [4, [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] . Severe illness can occur in otherwise healthy individuals of any age, but the highest proportion of severe cases occurs in adults older than 60 years of age or presenting underlying medical comorbidities. Potential risk factors for severe illness include cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, diabetes mellitus, chronic lung disease, malignancies, and obesity [19] [20] [21] [22] . In addition, a significantly higher prevalence of COVID-19 disease and increased mortality have been recorded in patients with an impairment of the immune response, such as onco-hematological patients or individuals with autoimmune diseases [23, 24] . The most common laboratory abnormalities among hospitalized patients with COVID-19 include lymphopenia, elevated aminotransaminase, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and inflammatory markers such as C-reactive protein (CRP), ferritin, and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) [3, 4, 6, [25] [26] [27] . Common abnormal chest radiograph findings were consolidation and ground-glass opacities, with bilateral, peripheral, and lower lung zone distributions [28] . Chest computed tomography (CT) studies confirmed the presence of bilateral peripheral ground-glass opacification, with or without consolidative abnormalities, while less common findings included pleural thickening, pleural effusion, and lymphadenopathy [29] [30] [31] .",

            "text": "A number of approaches to COVID-19 therapy have been investigated, including chloroquine, antiviral drugs, interleukin-6 pathway inhibitors, and other immunomodulators. In vitro studies have shown that hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine can bind cell surface sialic acid and gangliosides with high affinity, thereby impairing SARS-CoV-2 from binding to host cell angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-2 receptors [32, 33] . On the basis of their potential antiviral activity in vitro, several randomized trials have been conducted to evaluate their clinical use, but none have suggested a clear efficacy [34] [35] [36] . In addition, most observational studies have not suggested a benefit with chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine treatment [37, 38] and have highlighted the potential risk for toxicity of those drugs. Arrhythmias and QT interval prolongation emerged as the most relevant adverse events, particularly when these agents are administered in patients with comorbidities or in combination with other medicines known to prolong the QT interval, including azithromycin. Antiviral agent lopinavir/ritonavir has been considered a promising treatment option for COVID-19 infections based on its proven in vitro efficacy against other novel coronaviruses SARS-COV via the inhibition of 3-chymotrypsin-like protease [39, 40] . However, results from a randomized trial did not demonstrate a clear benefit of lopinavirritonavir compared with standard care alone at the cost of increased toxicity [41] . Due to the observation that some patients have a marked elevation in proinflammatory markers, with a clinical presentation that resembles cytokine release syndrome, interrupting the inflammatory cascade has been proposed as a potential therapeutic target for COVID-19 to prevent disease progression. Tocilizumab, an interleukin (IL)-6 receptor inhibitor, is being evaluated in randomized trials for the treatment of COVID-19 [42] [43] [44] . Similarly, glucocorticoids have been used in patients with moderate to severe ARDS [45] .",

Our cohort of patients is consistent with this data, with a median age at presentation of 77 years and with 68.2% of patients aged 70 or older. Consistent with CDC data, mortality was confirmed highest among elderly patients, with 86.7% and 62.2% of deaths occurring in persons older than 70 and 80 years, respectively. Analysis of the ROC curve confirmed an optimal cut-off point at 69 years, with an estimated 28-day survival rate of 67.4% and 21.4% for patients younger or older than 70 years, respectively; age over 70 years proved to be an independent risk factor for survival when combined in multivariate analysis. Several comorbidities have been associated with severe illness and mortality in SARS-CoV-2 infection. In a subset of 355 Italian patients who died with COVID-19, the mean number of preexisting comorbidities was 2.7, with less than 1% of patients presenting no underlying condition and approximately half of the patients presenting 3 or more comorbidities [22] . In accordance with these data, in our study, 57.6% of patients had two or more preexisting comorbidities among those considered potential risk factors for severe COVID-19 disease. Survival analysis showed prognostic significance for comorbidities, but the significance was not retained when tested against other clinical and therapeutic variables in multivariate analysis.",

Elevated lactate dehydrogenase, C-reactive protein, and interleukin-6 levels are other common laboratory findings among hospitalized patients with COVID-19 [3, 4, 6, 26] . However, none of these characteristics have been clearly demonstrated to have a strong prognostic value. In our patient population, LDH, CRP, and IL-6 showed an optimal cut-off point for survival in a ROC curve analysis, while we found no significance for the other laboratory tests of WBC, PCT, ferritin, and D-dimer. Based on these data, inflammation markers CRP and LDH have been incorporated into a prognostic score system, which has been shown to recognize three distinct groups of patients characterized by different disease severities and clinical outcomes.

The optimal approach to the treatment of COVID-19 disease is uncertain since for most potential therapies, evidence of their use comes primarily from observational data or indirect evidence. Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), notably used in autoimmune diseases, has been considered of potential interest in SARS-CoV-2 infection. In vitro studies have indeed shown that HCQ binds cell surface sialic acid and gangliosides with high affinity, thereby impairing SARS-CoV-2 spike protein recognition and binding to host cell ACE-2 receptors [32] . On the basis of these data, the Taiwanese CDC declared HCQ a potential important anti-SARS-CoV-2 agent on 26 March 2020. An early French study highlighted the ability of 600 mg daily of HCQ, particularly in combination with azithromycin, to clear respiratory viral loads in 3 to 6 days [34] . In a subsequent retrospective multicenter cohort study among 1438 hospitalized patients with a diagnosis of COVID-19, hospitalized in metropolitan New York, treatment with hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, or both, compared with neither treatment, was not significantly associated with differences in in-hospital mortality [35] . Finally, in an open-label randomized trial of 150 hospitalized patients with mild to moderate COVID-19, adding hydroxychloroquine to the standard of care did not improve the rate of SARS-CoV-2 clearance nor did it result in symptomatic improvement by 28 days [36] .",

In a multicentric retrospective matched-cohort study conducted during the SARS outbreak, the addition of lopinavir/ritonavir as initial treatment was associated with a statistically significant reduction in the overall death rate and intubation rate compared with matched controls [49] . In addition, a significant reduction in adverse events, such as severe respiratory deterioration and lower nosocomial infections, was also noted in patients treated with lopinavir/ritonavir, and significance was confirmed at multivariate analysis [39, 49] . Notably, no published in vitro activity data against SARS-CoV-2 exist for lopinavir/ritonavir. Results from a randomized open-label trial involving hospitalized adult patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection did not demonstrate a clear benefit of lopinavir/ritonavir treatment in 199 patients with severe COVID-19 beyond standard care alone [41] . Though there was a trend towards decreased mortality (particularly when administered within 12 days of symptom onset) and a reduction in serious adverse events, treatment with lopinavir/ritonavir was not associated with a difference in the time to clinical improvement nor in mortality at 28 days. Furthermore, the timing of lopinavir/ritonavir administration during the early peak of the viral replication phase (initial 7-10 days) appears to be crucial since delayed therapy initiation showed no effect on clinical outcomes [49, 50] .",

Based on data reporting the potential benefit of glucocorticoids in patients with moderate to severe ARDS, a weak recommendation in favor of such therapy has been provided in this population. However, glucocorticoid administration in critically ill patients with COVID-19-related ARDS is not routinely suggested since data are limited to a single retrospective Chinese cohort [12] ; there is concern about delayed viral clearance in patients with ARDS due to viral pneumonia. In our cohort, glucocorticoids were administered in patients still needing oxygen therapy at the end of the viral replication phase (i.e., after more than 7 days from the onset of symptoms), which consisted of a short course of methylprednisolone, up to 1 mg/kg for 5 days with a rapid tapering. Patients who presented with symptoms or signs of bacterial overinfection were excluded from glucocorticoid treatment.

Recently, Giardini et al. identified a possible mechanism between SARS-CoV-2 infection and the prothrombotic profile observed in these patients. Data offered a link between ACE2 downregulation and an AngII/s-Flt-1-mediated endothelial dysfunction in a model that strictly resembles preeclampsia, which could offer an explanation to the pathogenesis of the acute global vascular damage observed in these patients [58] . Several studies have suggested a high rate of thromboembolic complications among hospitalized patients, particularly those presenting with severe disease [5, [59] [60] [61] . In a retrospective series of more than 2500 hospitalized patients with COVID-19, anticoagulation was associated with improved in-hospital survival in intubated patients, with no evident increment of bleeding events [62] . In a retrospective study of individuals with severe COVID-19, LMWH appeared to be associated with improved survival when compared with no pharmacologic prophylaxis, especially in patients with high D-dimer levels [63] . Reports from ICU patients with severe COVID-19 suggest a higher incidence of venous thrombosis embolism, even when using standard prophylaxis [64, 65] . The question of an adequate anticoagulation dose for thromboprophylaxis has also been raised in COVID-19 patients. There are no actual data prospectively comparing the different levels of anticoagulation (prophylactic, intermediate, or therapeutic dosing) in COVID-19 patients, and clinical trials are ongoing. In our study population, we favor intermediate-dose anticoagulation (LMWH 100 U/Kg/d) as pharmacologic prophylaxis of venous thromboembolism for hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Interestingly, we found no difference in terms of 28-day survival between patients treated with intermediate-dose or therapeutic-dose anticoagulation for previous medical issues. In contrast, thromboprophylaxis at any dose appears to be associated with improved survival when compared with no pharmacologic prophylaxis, and significance is maintained even when combined in multivariate analysis.",

            "text": "Our study has several limitations due to the retrospective nature of the study. Overall, we found that age at the onset of SARS-CoV-2 disease is a powerful predictor of in-hospital mortality. In addition, intermediate-or therapeutic-dose anticoagulation, early short-term antiviral therapy, and short courses of corticosteroids at the end of the viral replication phase proved to be effective treatments for COVID-19 disease. Interestingly, hydroxychloroquine therapy has not been confirmed as significant in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection, in accordance with the latest literature data. Finally, impairment in inflammation markers can find application as predictors of poor outcomes for hospitalized patients when incorporated into an easy-to-use prognostic score, helping clinicians to identify patients with poor prognoses at an early stage. Confirmation from a validation cohort is expected. Results from this real-life single-center experience are in agreement and confirm actual literature data on SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia in terms of both risk factors for in-hospital mortality and the effectiveness of the different therapies proposed for the management of COVID-19 disease. Results from randomized clinical trials are expected. ",
