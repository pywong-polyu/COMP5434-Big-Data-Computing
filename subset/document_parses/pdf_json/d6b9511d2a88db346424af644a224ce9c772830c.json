We applied novel approaches to analyze T cell reactivity and showed that T anergy is already present in non-ventilated COVID-19 patients, very pronounced in ventilated patients, strongly associated with virus persistence and reversible with clinical recovery. T cell activation was measured by downstream effects on responder cells like basophils, plasmacytoid dendritic cells, monocytes and neutrophils in whole blood and proved to be much more meaningful than classical readouts with PBMCs. Monocytes responded stronger in males than females and IL-2 partially reversed T cell anergy. Downstream markers of T cell anergy were also found in fresh blood samples of critically ill patients with severe T cell anergy.",

Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and fatal outcomes are also associated with hyperinflammation and microthrombosis 7 . Activated monocytes / macrophages contribute to death in a mouse model of SARS-CoV infection 8 and also seem to play an important role for hyperinflammation in human SARS-CoV-2 infection 9, 10 . Monocytes are activated by a wide range of signals, including pathogen-derived signals (e.g. nucleic acids) and T cell-derived signals (e.g. cytokines) 11 . The innate immune system seems to be insufficient to rapidly clear SARS-CoV-2 infection by itself, as SARS-CoV-2-specific T and B cell responses develop in most patients [12] [13] [14] . Virus-specific T cell responses and neutralizing antibodies, typically generated in a T cell dependent manner, are considered essential for viral clearance 15 . Potential benefits of plasma obtained from convalescent COVID-19 patients also points into this direction 16, 17 . On the other hand, hyperinflammation in COVID-19 patients might be caused by excessive T cell responses that activate monocytes and neutrophils. Beneficial effects of dexamethason indicate that hyperinflammation contributes to fatal outcomes 18, 19 . However, dexamethason does not only interfere with T cell activation and could also exert therapeutic effects by blocking excessive innate immune responses against viral components.",

Ventilated patients also had a highly significant longer period of virus replication (28 days versus 10 days) that was defined as the period form the day of first clinical symptoms to the day of the last positive virus RT-PCR. Comorbidities were similar in both groups, while bacterial superinfection, thromboembolic complications and treatment with antibiotics or convalescent plasma were more frequent in ventilated patients (Tab. 1). As described before 27 , ventilated patients displayed higher plasma concentrations for biomarkers indicating inflammation (CRP, IL-6), liver and muscle dysfunction (LDH, Bilirubin, CK) and intravascular coagulation (Ddimer). Ventilated \"dead\" patients showed higher leukocyte counts and higher biomarkers for inflammation and liver dysfunction than ventilated \"survived\" patients (Supplementary Tab. 1). Impaired T cell reactivity is a hallmark of COVID-19 patients and correlates with disease severity To measure T cell reactivity we used fresh heparinized whole blood and polyclonally activated the T cells with immobilized anti-CD3 antibodies. T cell activation was quantified not only by cytokine release but also by downstream effects on various cell types including basophils, pDCs, monocytes and neutrophils. In preparation of the study we have established that T cell activation results in a strong activation of basophils measured by upregulation of CD203c and downregulation of the IL-3receptor beta-chain CD131 (used in this study). Basophils strongly express IL-3-receptors but only low levels of GM-CSF-and IL-5-receptors that also use CD131 for signal transduction 28 . Thus, among a variety of cytokines IL-3 is mainly responsible for downregulation of CD131 on basophils ( Supplementary Fig. 1a ). pDCs express IL-3-and GM-CSF-receptors; thus both cytokines contribute to downregulation of CD131 on pDCs ( Supplementary Fig. 1b) . CD14+ monocytes respond to T cell activation by a very pronounced upregulation of the IL-3-receptor alpha-chain CD123. Various  5   cytokines, including IL-3, GM-CSF, IL-2, IL-15, IFN-gamma, IFN-alpha, TNF-alpha induce a strong upregulation of CD123 on monocytes ( Supplementary Fig. 1c) . Thus monocytes integrate a larger set of direct and indirect T cell-derived signals. Similarly, neutrophils respond to a specific set of cytokines with upregulation of CD11b ( Supplementary Fig. 1d ).",

In COVID-19 patients these changes were much weaker. Ventilated COVID-19 patients showed no significant downregulation of CD131 on pDCs, a weak downregulation of CD131 on basophils (to 77%), a weak upregulation of CD123 on monocytes (to 345%) and of CD11b on neutrophils (to 424%). Responses of non-ventilated patients were in-between the responses of ventilated patients and healthy controls. Persistence of an impaired T cell activation as defined by weak upregulation of CD123 und CD11b was significantly associated with prolonged viral replication in these patients Downregulation of CD131 on basophils was almost completely dependent on IL-3 as shown with a blocking antibody against IL-3, while downregulation of CD131 on pDCs was only partially dependent on IL-3 ( Supplementary Fig. 2a, b) . Inhibition of IL-3 did not reduce the upregulation of CD123 on monocytes or CD11b on neutrophils ( Supplementary Fig. 2c , d), most likely due to the high redundancy of T cell-derived signals with similar effects. Stratification of ventilated COVID-19 patients according to their clinical outcome revealed that downregulation of CD131 on pDCs or basophils was low in both groups (Fig. 1b) . In contrast, upregulation of CD123 on monocytes and CD11b on neutrophils, that integrate a larger set of signals from activated T cells, were almost absent in COVID-19 patients with fatal outcome, but still detectable in ventilated patients who recovered and were later discharged from the ICU (Fig. 1d , f). In healthy males and non-ventilated male COVID-19 patients T cell activation resulted in a significantly stronger upregulation of CD123 on monocytes than in females, suggesting a stronger T cell -monocyte connection in males ( Supplementary Fig. 4c ). In ventilated COVID-19 patients the impairment of T cell-induced CD123 upregulation on monocytes was very pronounced in both genders ( Supplementary Fig. 4c ). Basophils, pDCs and neutrophils responded equally to T cell activation in males and females ( Supplementary Fig. 4a , b, d).",

Basophils and monocytes responded only weakly to T cell derived signals without significant differences between the study groups ( Supplementary Fig. 5a, b) . Classical read-outs of T cell activation, like upregulation of CD25 on T cells ( Supplementary Fig. 5c, d) and release of T cell-derived cytokines ( Supplementary Fig. 5e) worked well and showed impaired T cell activation in ventilated COVID-19 patients with fatal outcome, but no significant differences between non-ventilated and ventilated patients. In order to analyze whether T cell anergy can be overcome with IL-2, we stimulated PBMC from patients with anti-CD3 alone or with a combination of anti-CD3 and IL-2 ( Supplementary Fig. 5f ). IL-2 significantly increased the release of GM-CSF and IFN-gamma, suggesting that IL-2 is able to partially overcome T cell anergy in COVID-19 patients.",

The first two parameters are CD123-upregulation on monocytes and CD11b-upregulation on neutrophils induced by anti-CD3 in whole blood with a cut-off of 130%. Both parameters reflect the degree of T cell anergy; however they are not interchangeable, as monocytes and neutrophils sense different sets of T cell derived signals. The third parameter is the basophil count in the peripheral blood with a cut-off of 25 / \u00b5l. All three parameters should be easy to establish in different labs, because counting of basophils is routine and no standardized absolute expression levels are required for upregulation of CD123 and CD11b as only relative changes are calculated. By combination of all three parameters a positive predictive value of 100% and a negative predictive value of 94% were reached for fatal outcome of patients on mechanical ventilation.",

In addition, T cell activation assays with whole blood were superior to assays with purified PBMCs, because reactivity of basophils and monocytes was severely impaired after isolation of PBMCs. Whole blood has the advantage of Our data indicate that low T cell reactivity rather than anergy of downstream responder cells accounts for the low response of basophils, pDCs, monocytes and neutrophils, because relevant T cell-derived cytokines like IL-3, GM-CSF and IFN-gamma were reduced in a similar manner and neutralization of IL-3 markedly blocked the downstream effects on basophils.",

Induction of T cell anergy could be a strategy of the virus to interfere with specific host immune responses and may explain the prolonged viral replication seen in the group of ventilated patients. Prolonged viral replication in turn may result in more tissue destruction, more activation of innate immune cells by viral components and more inflammation. The pronounced T cell anergy in critically ill patients with hyperinflammation strongly argues against a major direct role of T cells for hyperinflammation. Immunosuppressive approaches targeting T cells are unlikely to improve hyperinflammation, while strategies to overcome the pronounced T cell anergy in critically ill COVID-19 patients could be a promising therapeutic approach to improve virus clearance without aggravating the hyperinflammation.",

Cells were analyzed by flow cytometry.Preparation and culture of PBMCs Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were prepared by Ficoll-Paque density gradient centrifugation from heparin-anticoagulated fresh blood samples. For cryopreservation, PBMCs were resuspended in fetal calf serum (FCS) with 10% dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) at a concentration of 1-2 x 10 6 cells / ml, frozen at -80\u00b0C for 2-3 days and then transferred into liquid nitrogen. The cells were thawed in a 37\u00b0C water bath and washed 3 times with medium. The viability was controlled by Trypan-blue staining and was 90-95%. PBMCs (500.000/well) were cultured in 300 \u00b5l medium / well with or without anti-CD3 (clone: OKT3) 5 \u00b5g/ml for 24 hours by 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2. Where indicated IL-2 (20 ng/ml) was added to the samples during the incubation. Thereafter supernatants were recovered and analyzed by ELISA. Cells were analyzed by flow cytometry. Flow cytometry Anti-coagulated fresh blood samples (100 \u00b5l) or cells after whole blood stimulations were incubated with various panels of the following directly labeled monoclonal antibodies for 20 minutes by 4\u00b0C: anti-CD3 APC-Cy7 (clone: SK7, BioLegend), anti-CD4 V500 (clone RPA-T4, BD Bioscience), anti-CD8 APC-eFluor 780 (clone: RPA-T8, Invitrogen, Darmstadt, Germany) and anti-CD8 PE-Cy7 (clone: SK1, BioLegend), anti-CD11b PE-Cy7(clone: M1/70, BioLegend, San Diego, CA), anti-CD14 V500 (clone: M\u03a6P9, BD Bioscience), anti-CD16 Pacific Blue (clone: 3G8, BioLegend), anti-CD19 Pacific Blue (clone: HIB19, BioLegend), anti-CD25 APC (clone: BC96, BioLegend), anti-CD116 FITC (clone: 4H1, BioLegend), anti-CD131 PE (clone: 1C1, eBioscience), anti-CD123 PE-Cy5 (BD Bioscience), anti-CD169 PE (clone: 7-239, Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany), CD304 APC (clone: 12C2, BioLegend), HLA-DR II APC and FITC (clone: G-46-6, BD Bioscience).",

For measurement of IL-3, ELISA plates (NUNC Maxisorb, Thermofisher Scientific, Waltham, USA) were coated with a capture anti-IL-3 antibody (Clone P8C11; 5 \u00b5g/ml in PBS) in 100 \u00b5l / well at room temperature (RT) overnight. Plates were washed 3 times with PBS / 0.05 % Tween-20, blocked with PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) at RT for 1 hour and washed again with PBS. Samples where preincubated with 100 \u00b5g/ml mouse IgG1, kappa isotype control antibody (MOPC21, BioXCell, Lebanon, USA) for 1 hour by RT and added to the plates for 2 hours by RT (100 \u00b5l / well, diluted in PBS / 1% BSA). Recombinant human IL-3 (BioLegend) was diluted from 7.8 -500 pg/ml in PBS / 1% BSA and served as standard. After washing plates were incubated with 400 ng/ml HRP-labelled detection anti-IL-3 antibody (Clone 13) (100 \u00b5l/well) for 1.5 hours at RT and color reaction was performed with TMB Substrate Solution (BioLegend) according to manufacturer's protocol. Predictive score for death in ventilated COVID-19 patients Three parameters were used individually or in combination to predict fatal outcome in ventilated COVID-19 patients. Absolute basophil counts in fresh peripheral blood. Basophil counts < 25 / \u00b5l defined \"Low Baso count\". Upregulation of CD123 on CD14+ monocytes and CD11b on neutrophils was calculated as the ratio of surface marker expression with anti-CD3 and surface marker expression without anti-CD3. Upregulation of < 130% defined \"Weak upregulation\". In the combined scores a logical AND combination was used that required all parameters to be fulfilled. For all three parameters 77 data sets from 21 ventilated COVID-19 patients were available. 17 ventilated patients were discharged from the ICU (survived) (69 samples) and 4 patients died on the ICU (8 samples). The number of right and false positive samples, the test sensitivity (Sens.), specificity (Spe.) was calculated. The negative (NPV) and positive predictive value (PPV) for predicting death were calculated using a prevalence of death in ventilated COVID-19 patients of 19 % (4 dead patients / 21 ventilated patients).",
