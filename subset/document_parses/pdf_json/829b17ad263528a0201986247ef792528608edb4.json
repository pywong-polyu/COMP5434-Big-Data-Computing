Managing a healthy lifestyle has been shown to reduce blood pressure and improve health outcomes. We aim to investigate the effectiveness of a lifestyle modification intervention program for lowering blood pressure in a rural area of Bangladesh. Methods: A single-center cluster randomized controlled trial (RCT). The study will be conducted for 6 months, a total of 300 participants of age 30 to 75 years with 150 adults in each of the intervention and the control arms. The intervention arm will involve the delivery of a blended learning education program on lifestyle changes for the management of high blood pressure. The education program comprises evidence-based information with pictures, fact sheets, and published literature about the effects of high blood pressure on CVD development, increased physical activity, and the role of a healthy diet in blood pressure management. The control group involves providing information booklets and general advice at the baseline data collection point. The primary outcome will be the absolute difference in clinic SBP and DBP. Secondary outcomes include the difference in the percentage of people adopting regular exercise habits, cessation of smoking and reducing sodium chloride intake, health literacy of all participants, and the perceived barriers and enablers to adopt behavior changes by collecting qualitative data. Analyses will include analysis of covariance to report the mean difference in blood pressure between the control and the intervention group and the difference in change in blood pressure due to the intervention. Discussion: The study will assess the effects of physical activity and lifestyle modification in controlling high blood pressure. This study will develop new evidence as to whether a simple lifestyle program implemented in a rural region of a low-and middle-income country will improve blood pressure parameters for people with different chronic diseases by engaging community people.",

Raised blood pressure accounts for as many as 10.4 million deaths per year globally [1, 2] . The prevalence of high blood pressure has increased from 87.0 million in 1999-2000 to 108.2 million in 2015-2016 [3] . The estimated number of annual deaths is 1.5 million worldwide, of which 9.4% has been reported to be due to high blood pressure [1] . Modifiable risk factors such as smoking, unhealthy diet, and physical inactivity are shared and established risk factors for CVDs [2, 4] . Different strategies including lifestyle changes such as smoking cessation, diet alteration including a reduction in dietary sodium intake, increased physical activity, and adherence to medication can help in managing high blood pressures and improve health outcomes by decreasing or slowing complications associated with high blood pressure and other CVDs [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] , but strategies targeting multiple-level or patient-level barriers are effective in controlling high blood pressure [9] .",

One of the successful models in increasing hypertension awareness, control, and treatment is the Canadian Hypertension Education Program (CHEP), which has been recommended for the development and implementation of healthcare system at the international level [11, 12] . Despite the high prevalence of high blood pressure in low-income and middle-income countries, there are relatively few data on intervention programs from low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs) [13] . Studies also report that a significant proportion of people with high blood pressure are undiagnosed or do not meet targets to control blood pressure both in developed [14] and in LMICs [15, 16] . Among people with known high blood pressure, less than one-third of people can control their high blood pressure with appropriate treatment [13, 17] . Lifestyle modification programs have been shown to be effective in controlling blood pressure in LMICs [18] [19] [20] .",

            "text": "Recently, a community-based cluster randomized controlled trial was conducted in rural communities in Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka. This multicomponent intervention program was conducted for 24 months in 2645 adults with hypertension defined as blood pressure greater than or equal to 140/90 mmHg. The study reported a statistically significant mean reduction of SBP of 5.2 mmHg from the baseline mean blood pressure 146.7 mmHg compared to the usual care in which the reduction was 3.9 mmHg. A similar mean reduction in SBP was observed in a previous cluster randomized clinical trial. Therapeutic lifestyle change intervention plus motivational interviewing intervention for 6 months was associated with SBP reduction of 5.79 mmHg compared to health education intervention only [26] . Relatively small reductions of 2 mmHg in SBP and DBP have been reported to lower the risk of stroke by 14% and 17%, respectively, and the risk of coronary artery disease by 9% and 6%, respectively [27] . The intervention program included home visits by government community health workers for blood pressure monitoring and counseling and the training of physicians [20] . A possible limitation of this intervention program [20] may be that home visits by trained community health workers for blood pressure monitoring and counseling may not be a sustainable and cost-saving approach due to the shortage of qualified workforce and the budget constraints in lowmiddle-income countries. Application of blended learning education programs to educate patients in managing blood pressure by changing lifestyle and participation in intervention programs as volunteers coordinated by volunteer leaders may be a sustainable approach for lowering blood pressure in the community setting. The goal of this study is to compare a multicomponent intervention program to evaluate its effectiveness for lowering blood pressure among adults with high blood pressure in a rural district in Bangladesh.",

            "text": "Health literacy is a complex and combined perception comprising a range of attributes including available resources of health-related information and an individuals' intellectual, emotional, social, and personal skills [28] . Health literacy empowers people with skills to improve their health and well-being. Evidence indicates that deficits in health literacy are associated with poorer health outcomes and higher health-related costs at both individual and system levels [29, 30] . Improved health literacy had been reported to be associated with reductions in risk behaviors for chronic disease [31, 32] . However, an extended and often asymptomatic onset and a need for ongoing management, these conditions present people with a sharp and upward learning curve about risks, treatments, and self-care. Self-care, especially in resource-limited settings, an essential dimension of treatment, depends on the ability of systems and providers to teach and patients to learn effective selfmanagement skills [33] . At the individual level, good health literacy is the foundation of successful management and prevention of chronic disease. Health literacy assessment can be used to improve community participation in health, health service planning, public health education, and policy development [34] . In the past decade, much research on the impact of health literacy on health outcomes has been conducted across the globe [32, 35] ; however, health literacy tools in rural areas of Bangladesh have not been developed or tested. The European Health Literacy Survey (HLS-Q12) questionnaire has been used to assess health literacy [36] ; however, its usefulness to measure health literacy in rural Bangladesh has not been investigated.",

Each district is divided into Upazilas (sub-districts), and each Upazila is divided into Unions which consist of 15-20 villages [37] . A crosssectional study was conducted among 3104 participants of age 30-89 years in 2013 in the Banshgram Union that identified 1242 (40%) participants with hypertension according to WHO guidelines as SBP \u2265140 mmHg and/or DBP \u226590 mmHg and/or self-report use of medication for hypertension [15] . Given the intervention of the present study that needs lifestyle modification and more use of a mobile phone, it was decided to limit the age to 75 years as access and use of mobile phones was likely more problematic with older participants [38] . Thus, we chose to limit our upper age to 75 years, leaving 1072 eligible participants for this study. Based on power calculations, we require only 300 participants and expect to recruit the required number of participants without any major difficulty. Inclusion criteria will be based on recent guidelines or definition of hypertension [25] ; anyone with SBP \u2265130 mmHg and/or DBP \u226580 mmHg and/or self-report use of medication for hypertension will be considered eligible for the current study.",

An intervention study using automated selfmanagement calls and home blood pressure monitoring conducted in Honduras and Mexico [48] reported a significant decrease in blood pressure. Many previous studies to manage blood pressure by lifestyle changes have been conducted by health professionals, nurses, or health technicians [18, 20] . Our intervention program consists of delivering a blended learning education and training program, which is expected to be a more sustainable approach due to the limited resources in LMICs. Another component of our intervention is the engagement of community volunteers. The study coordinator will communicate with the team leaders who will lead various lifestyle modification programs within and across the teams. The current intervention is expected to be more sustainable compared to other studies in which health services have been provided by nurses and other health professionals at individual levels [48, 49] , which are anticipated to be more resource-involved intervention programs.",

Intervention through motivational counseling has reported a significant increase in quitting smoking [50] , reduction in blood pressure, active participation in physical activities, and changing dietary patterns [51, 52] . Therefore, our results may inform future studies in similar settings to test whether this program can be successfully implemented into a wider non-communicable disease prevention and management program. The study will also report the status of health literacy in rural people in Bangladesh. The findings will inform the future design and conducting of appropriate interventions that could be used to deliver long-term programs. Previous studies, for instance, have demonstrated some benefit in the use of mobile phone interventions for diabetes management [53, 54] , hypertension [55] , and other healthcare services [56] . However, most of these programs have been smallscale pilot projects and not transformed into a community program. Although this is a cluster RCT design to lower blood pressure by modifying lifestyle, we have incorporated questions to collect data on mobile use among participants and their willingness to receive and pay for receiving a text message system for receiving health information.
