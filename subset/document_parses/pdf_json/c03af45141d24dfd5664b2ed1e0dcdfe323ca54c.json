Following literature review, a pool of items was developed and pilot tested with a convenience sample of adults recruited through MTurk (N = 554). Exploratory factor analysis suggested three distinct dimensions of others-growth, self-growth, and career-focused purpose orientations. The three-factor structure was confirmed with two independent samples of intercollegiate coaches in Study 2 (N = 377) and with teachers in Study 3 (N = 247) through the use of confirmatory factor analysis. Construct validity of the items was assessed, which included examining factor loadings and reliability, convergent validity, discriminant validity, and nomological validity. Overall, the 12 items measuring purpose orientations are suggested as valid and reliable for research and for reflection on the nature of their life purpose to ultimately promote wellbeing in adult populations.",

Research has consistently demonstrated purpose as a significant contributor for people's wellbeing, positive affect, good health, hope, happiness, persistence, motivation, career success (e.g., Bronk et al., 2009; Burrow & Hill, 2011; Hill et al., 2018; Kang et al., 2019; Kim et al., 2020; Sharma & de Alba, 2018; Windsor et al., 2015; Yeager & Bundick, 2009) . Scholars have also emphasized that people who are aware of and find purpose in professional and personal roles are most equipped to cope with stress caused by role conflicts and enjoy a sense of work-life balance (e.g., Bragger et al., 2021) . For example, Bragger et al. (2021) found that couples who share a sense of purpose in their careers experience lesser work-family strain-based conflict and greater benefits in their family lives. Gra\u00e7a et al. (2021) reported that when working adults such as higher education teachers and researchers recognize their work's value in contributing to the betterment of society, they experience greater sense of motivation, happiness, and productivity. Therefore, helping working adults connect meaning at work with their life's larger purpose can contribute to their positive work outcomes, relationships, and personal wellbeing (Bragger et al., 2021; Gra\u00e7a et al., 2021) .",

However, most of these measures have focused only on assessing the extent to which people are aware of their purpose in life instead of the nature of their life's purpose. Literature has shown that in addition to a general sense of purpose, specific purpose orientations play a critical role in impacting people's wellness and career outcomes (e.g., Hill et al., 2010; Sharma et al., 2017 Sharma et al., , 2021 . For example, Hill et al. (2010) demonstrated that during middle adulthood, prosocial purpose orientation is more predictive of greater generativity, personal growth, and integrity in contrast to other purpose orientations. Likewise, found a positive relationship between college students' altruistic purpose in life and degree commitment. Sharma et al. (2017) however found that students with career purpose orientation were more likely to enroll in college. Sharma et al. (2021) further reported that among four types of purpose (career, interpersonal, altruistic, and self-oriented), career and interpersonal purpose orientations were positively related to college students' postsecondary completion. Developing an instrument that can assess people's purpose orientations could further advance clarity about the nature and role of purpose orientations among people from different cultural and age groups, and promote purpose-fostering interventions (Wang et al., 2020) .",

            "text": "The present study focuses on the development and validation of the purpose orientation scale in adults to assess their occupational well-being. The pursuit of this study is a timely endeavor due to the challenges posed by COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting economic downturn, which has not only caused financial stress among innumerable working-adults but also a loss of purpose that often arises from careerfocused efforts. Several existential and humanistic scholars have indeed stressed that it is during the most challenging times of transitions that people often seek to explore, clarify, and develop purpose (Dalton & Crosby, 2010; Frankl, 1984; Ikeda, 2017) . Therefore, the scale can be used for research and for reflective purposes to help in actualizing the vision of transforming current times of adversity into periods of reflection and growth. Hill et al. (2010) defined purpose orientations as the \"constellations of related, longterm life goals\" (p. 174). According to Hill et al. (2010) , purpose in life is indicated by people's multiple and often related life goals instead of a single goal. To give an example, Hill et al. (2010) expressed that people with an altruistic purpose might have several altruistic life goals such as serving their community, helping others, influencing the social structure and so forth, instead of only one prosocial goal. Hill et al. (2010) further conducted factor analysis on 17 different life-goals listed in the UCLA's Higher Education Research Institute's (HERI) survey and identified four purpose orientations among college students: prosocial, financial, creative, and personal recognition orientations. Based on Hill et al.'s (2010) conceptualization, Sharma et al. (2017) conducted factor analysis on the 14 life-goals included in the Educational Longitudinal Study 2002 (ELS:2002 database and reported four purpose orientations among high school students: career, interpersonal, altruistic, and self-oriented orientations. One of the limitations of Hill et al.'s (2010) and Sharma et al.'s (2017) research is that their assessment of purpose orientations was limited to pre-developed surveys. Sharma et al. (2017) indeed reported that due to the limited items in ELS:2002 database and low reliabilities of the self-oriented and altruistic purpose orientations, the results of their study might not have fully captured the essence and role of these two purpose orientations.",

            "text": "Another study that has focused on the construct of life's major goals was conducted by Roberts and Robbins (2000) . Major life goals refer to people's aspirations to shape their life context and construct general life structures such as having a family, a certain lifestyle, a career, and so forth (Roberts & Robbins, 2000) . Based on theoretical and empirical procedures to organize a set of life goals into thematic content clusters, Roberts and Robbins (2000) revealed the following major goal clusters: economic, aesthetic, social, relationship, political, hedonistic, and religious. Yet, while purpose and life goals are related constructs, they are also distinct. One main distinction is that purpose is a generalized intention behind people's far-reaching goals (Damon et al., 2003) and a source of inspiration to fulfill current goals (McKnight & Kashdan, 2009 ). Yeager and Bundick (2009) investigated the relationship between work goals, purpose, and meaning among adolescents. Based on a mixed-methods study, Yeager and Bundick (2009) reported four types of reasons behind adolescents' work-related goals: intrinsic self-oriented reasons, intrinsic beyond-the-self-oriented reasons, extrinsic self-oriented reasons, and extrinsic beyond-the-self-oriented reasons. Recently, informed by Yeager and Bundick's (2009) findings, Summers and Falco (2020) assessed adolescents' orientations for purpose, which they described as primary reason or motivation for fulfilling their life's goal. To evaluate orientations for purpose, Summers and Falco (2020, p. 70 ) created a single item seeking adolescents' selection of one of the following primary reasons to pursue their life's goal: (a) \"It is interesting to me; I think I will be good at it [Intrinsic/Self-Oriented]\"; (b) \"I want to help others and make the world a better place [Intrinsic/Other-Oriented]\"; (c) \"I want to have a secure job/comfortable income [Extrinsic; Self-Oriented]\"; and (d) \"I want to make a positive contribution to my community and/or society [Extrinsic; Other-Oriented].\" While not variable-centered, Heng et al. (2017 Heng et al. ( , 2020 performed cluster analysis of life goals among Singapore and Israel adolescents, yielding the following purpose clusters of youth: (a) self-and other focused; (b) self-focused; (c) other-focused; and (d) no orientation or no discernible life purpose. Most recently, Wang et al. (2020) developed a Chinese life purpose orientation questionnaire to help cultivate and assess different domains of life purpose among Chinese college students. Wang et al. (2020) questionnaire has 18 items encompassing five domains of purpose: pleasure seeking, self-strengthening, family harmony, social recognition, and social dedication. One of the limitations of Wang et al. (2020) questionnaire as they acknowledged is that their items \"appear as measures of values for some dimensions\" (p. 11).",

The aim of Study 2 was to test the factorial structure identified in Study 1 with an independent sample, to further refine the scale, and to optimize its length. The final items were then tested in Study 3 with a new independent sample to confirm the factor structure. The goals of Studies 2 and 3 also included assessing construct validity of the items, which included factor loadings and reliability, convergent validity, discriminant validity, and nomological validity. Overall, the scale development process was guided by the guidelines proposed by DeVellis (2017). In Study 1, we used a convenience sample of adults recruited through MTurk website.

The development of these items was based on the review of studies as outlined in the literature review as well as inspired by reviewing the 712 quotes about purpose of life posted on the Goodreads (n.d.) website. Specifically, we aimed to develop items that would assess several orientations of life purpose, which we hypothesized to represent five dimensions. The first dimension was focused on helping others grow (e.g., \"To make people aware that they can accomplish more, aim higher, and reach for excellence\") and consisted of eight items. We also added a dimension titled altruistic: community-oriented (e.g., \"To make a positive difference in my community\"), which consisted of five items, all of them were rephrased from the altruistic purpose subscale of the Sense of Purpose Scale . The third dimension was focused on nurturing personal virtues (e.g., \"To cultivate compassion and empathy within me\") and consisted of five items. The fourth dimension was focused on personal growth (e.g., \"To aim higher and reach for excellence\") and consisted of eight items. Finally, the fifth dimension was career-focused purpose orientation (e.g., \"To be successful in the field of my work\") and consisted of three items. Prior to finalization of the set, items were sent for content validation feedback (DeVellis, 2017) for relevance and clarity and received suggestions were carefully considered. These items were then pilottested with the following instructions: \"Please read each statement below and indicate how much you agree or disagree with each of them. There are no right or wrong answers. Please be open and honest in your responding.\" The items had a common stem, \"My purpose in life is\u2026,\" followed by the list of items and a 7-point response scale, ranging from 1 = strongly disagree to 7 = strongly agree.",

We were especially interested in the altruistic purpose subscale, because it can be considered as a type of purpose orientation. Therefore, we were interested in examining how our new items perform in relation to the SOPS-2 items. We chose the SOPS-2, because psychometric properties of the SOPS-2 items have been rigorously examined with, showing strong evidence of reliability and validity in a series of validation and application studies with college students and adults (e.g., Sharma & Yukhymenko-Lescroart, 2019; Yukhymenko-Lescroart & Sharma, 2020a, b) .

First, parallel analysis, which was found to be accurate across a wide range of situations (Hair et al., 2019) , was used to decide on the number of factors, by using an SPSS macro (O'Connor, 2000) . Then, exploratory factor analysis was performed with principal axis factoring extraction to consider the shared variance among items and with direct Oblimin rotation, which allows correlated factors (Hair et al., 2019) . The results were examined for the amount of variance explained by each factor and factor loadings. Following Hair et al. (2019) guidelines, it was expected that each factor would account for at least 5% of the variance, and that factor loadings would be at last |.50|, which would signal considered practical significance, with loadings exceeding |.70| indicating well-defined factor structure. In addition to statistical considerations, items were also examined based on conceptual considerations in order to optimize scale length. Generally shorter scales are good because they provide less burden on participants; thus, length optimization of a scale is an important consideration in a scale development and validation process (DeVellis, 2017). In the next step, the factors were labeled and interpreted. Next, internal consistency of items within each factor was examined based on the values of Cronbach's alpha, after which mean scores were computed for each dimension and examined using descriptive statistics. Bivariate correlations were examined among the items of purpose orientations and with the three dimensions of the sense of purpose (i.e., awakening to purpose, awareness of purpose, and altruistic purpose). Finally, the subscale scores were compared across employment status and parenthood status to examine nomological validity (Hair et al., 2019) of scores.",

CFA models were tested in Mplus, version 8.5 (Muth\u00e9n & Muth\u00e9n, 2012 -2021 using maximum likelihood estimation method with robust standard errors. Models were assessed based on several fit indices, following Hair et al.'s (2019) guidelines for models with 12 to 30 observed variables and samples sizes of over 250, which suggest that Comparative Fit Index (CFI) and Tucker-Lewis Index (TLI) of above 0.94, Root Mean Squared Error of Approximation (RMSEA) of less than 0.07, and Standardized Root Mean Square Residual (SRMR) of 0.08 or less would provide evidence of relatively good fit. In Study 2, we also used CFA to further refine the scale, select best-performing items, and optimize scale length (DeVellis, 2017) , which was then also tested in Study 3. Once the final model was accepted, we then examined construct validity in Studies 2 and 3, which included factor loadings and reliability, convergent validity, discriminant validity, and nomological validity, following guidelines of Hair et al. (2019) . Specifically, factor loadings would be above 0.50, preferably above 0.70, would indicate high convergent validity, or that the items share a high proportion of variance in common. Reliability, which is also an indicator of convergent validity, was examined based on construct reliability (CR), which is often used in conjunction with CFA models instead of coefficient alpha. CR values above 0.70 would indicate that internal consistency exists with all items consistently representing the same latent construct. For additional evidence of adequate convergence, the average variance extracted (AVE) values would be above 0.50, but below the corresponding values of CR. For evidence of discriminant validity, which means that individual measured items represent only one latent construct, we expected that AVE values for each subscale would be greater than the corresponding values of average shared variance (ASV) and maximum shared variance (MSV). Finally, for evidence of nomological validity, which is tested by examining whether the correlations among the constructs in a measurement theory make sense (Hair et al., 2019, p. 677) , we expected that the purpose orientation subscales would be positively associated with the subscales of altruistic purpose, awareness of purpose, and awakening to purpose. In addition to using the SOPS-2 items, nomological validity was also assessed based on several classification variables (Hair et al., 2019, p. 690) , including years that the participants had worked in their fields in Studies 2 and 3, as well as coaches' sex (male, female), level of athletics (Division I, Division III), and where coaches were in their season (pre-season, in season, off season) in Study 2 and teachers' grade level (elementary, middle, high school), the type of school (urban, suburban, rural), and whether teaching was their first career (yes, no) in Study 3.",

Confirmatory factor analysis was then used in Studies 2 and 3 to test the factor-structure identified in Study 1 with two new independent samples. In Study 2, the selected items were refined and tested with a sample of intercollegiate coaches with the goal to confirm factor structure identified in Study 1 and further refine the scale by optimize its length. Finally, in Study 3, the final items were tested with an independent sample of K-12 teachers with the goal to confirm factor structure and to further validate the items for the use working adults. As a result, 12 items were identified as final to constitute the specific purpose orientations scale, designed to measure the dimensions of others-growth, self-growth, and career-focused purpose orientation.

However, the results of parallel analysis and exploratory factor analysis in Study 1 suggested three distinct factors of purpose orientation. Specifically, the first two dimensions, which were initially hypothesized to be distinct, collapsed into a single factor, which was labeled others-growth purpose orientation. This dimension of purpose orientation is defined as actualizing one's purpose in life through engagement in activities that would enrich the lives of other people. This dimension of purpose reflects the beyond-the-self component of purpose that is central to the one of the most recognized definition of purpose which was proposed by Damon et al. (2003) . The others-growth purpose orientation has also been suggested across multiple studies and groups of scholars who has focused their research efforts on examining purpose in adolescents, emerging adults, and adults (e.g., other-focused: Heng et al., 2017 Heng et al., , 2020 prosocial orientation: Hill et al., 2010; altruistic orientation: Sharma et al., 2018; other-oriented: Summers & Falco, 2020; social dedication: Wang et al., 2020) .

The presence of this purpose-oriented dimension has been suggested in previous studies. For example, Sharma et al. (2017) identified career purpose orientation as adolescents' desire to realize their career aspirations. While there is no direct equivalent dimension, career-focused purpose orientation is most closely aligned to the social recognition dimension that was derived with Chinese college students by Wang et al. (2020) , defined as pursuit of others' recognition and respect. However, as recognized by Wang et al. (2020) differences exist between Chinese and Western cultures, suggesting that a sense of responsibility to the self is prioritized in Western culture over responsivity to the community, which is not so in Chinese culture. Similar to Bragger et al.'s (2021) emphasis on cultivating working adults' purpose as the means to promote both professional outcomes and personal wellbeing, the results of the present study have also shown that career-focused purpose orientation can be congruent with others-growth and self-growth purpose orientations.",

Based on these results and previous theoretical perspectives (Damon et al., 2003; Hill et al., 2010) , we can conclude that purpose orientation is the underlying intention behind people's long-term aspirations, which can be self-oriented, others-oriented, and domain specific (e.g., career, religion, education). The present study has focused on one domain of career since our focus was to support working adults in using this scale. In future, we can expand this scale to encompass other domains such as education to support students in reflecting upon their purpose orientations. The items measuring the self-growth purpose orientation are in accord with cross-cultural insights on the importance of assessing people's self-strengthening purpose orientation (Wang et al., 2020) and focus on their personal growth and inner-transformation (Ikeda, 2017) . The items of others-growth purpose orientation are based upon Damon et al.'s (2003) definition of purpose as \"a stable and generalized intention to accomplish something that is at once meaningful to the self and of consequence to world beyond the self\" (p. 121). Accordingly, people's purpose can promote their personal sense of meaning and it can also contribute to others wellbeing. In the present study, \"others\" can refer to people's own family, friends, community, and world at large.",

First, the developed scale can potentially be used within counseling settings as a formative assessment tool to support working adults who are seeking a deeper purpose in life. It is likely to be effective as a tool that aids adults to reflect upon their life's purpose and gain insights into who they are and what they aspire to use their life for. Given the importance of cultivating sense of purpose among working adults to promote their professional outcomes and personal benefits (Bragger et al., 2021; Gra\u00e7a et al., 2021) , using the career-focused purpose orientation dimension of this scale might support in helping working adults discuss the intersections between their work, personal growth, family, and larger purpose in life. The use of this scale in counseling sessions with working adults could further support counselors in promoting work-life balance through helping clients to reflect upon their life's priorities and purpose orientations.",

Such purpose-focused counseling practice might be especially meaningful during the current era of COVID-19 pandemic that we believe has exacerbated existential anxiety among working adults. Apart from counselors, management training can also benefit from using this scale to help organizational managers and leaders discuss the ways to help their employees connect the sense of purpose and meaningfulness at work with the larger purpose of their lives (Bragger et al., 2021) .",

Future research is needed on whether the scale can be used with other adult populations, such as college students. Second, the samples recruited in Studies 2 and 3 were obtained within the context of COVID-19. While there is no reason to believe that the factor structure would be different, the strength of each purpose orientation reported by coaches and teachers in Studies 2 and 3 might be different from before COVID-19. For example, purpose orientation of coaches and teachers might shift depending on whether they work in a face-to-face mode or online. A third limitation is the use of web-based surveys, which can result in coverage and non-response bias. Nevertheless, the use of web-based surveys has a number of advantages (e.g., cost) and is particularly helpful in the context of physical distancing. Overall, future studies should continue validating this scale.",
