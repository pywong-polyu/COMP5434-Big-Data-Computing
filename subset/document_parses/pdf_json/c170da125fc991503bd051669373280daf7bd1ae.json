Originally considered a passive mechanical structure, decades of research have since demonstrated how the ECM dynamically regulates a diverse set of cellular processes in development, homeostasis, and disease progression. In September 2021, the American Society for Matrix Biology (ASMB) organized a hybrid scientific meeting, integrating in-person and virtual formats, to discuss the latest developments in ECM research. Here, we highlight exciting scientific advances that emerged from the meeting including (1) the use of model systems for fundamental and translation ECM research, (2) ECM-targeting approaches as therapeutic modalities, (3) cell-ECM interactions, and (4) the ECM as a critical component of tissue engineering strategies. In addition, we discuss how the ASMB incorporated mentoring, career development, and diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives in both virtual and in-person events. Finally, we reflect on the hybrid scientific conference format and how it will help the ASMB accomplish its mission moving forward.",

These macromolecules form a dynamic microenvironment surrounding cells and contribute biomechanical properties to connective tissues (Fig. 1) . However, ECM functions extend far beyond simple structural support for cells, tissues, and organs. Over the past decades, it has become increasingly clear that the ECM, via chemical and mechanical cues, also regulates cellular phenotypes including proliferation, migration, and differentiation (Rozario and DeSimone, 2010) . In addition, ECM components modulate growth factor bioavailability and signaling pathways, such as the TGF\u03b2, BMP, or Wnt pathways (Hynes, 2009 ). The ECM thus plays key functional roles in tissue and organ development and homeostasis (Rozario and DeSimone, 2010) . The importance of the ECM is further underscored by the fact that pathogenic variants in many genes encoding ECM protein cause disorders that can affect virtually all organ systems (Lamand\u00e9 and Bateman, 2019) . Prominent examples include Ehlers Danlos syndrome, Alport syndrome or Gould syndrome, which are caused by mutations in collagen genes, or Marfan syndrome and acromelic dysplasia, which are caused by mutations in fibrillin-1, ADAMTS proteases or ADAMTS-like proteins (Ramirez et al., 2018; Stanley et al., 2021) . In addition, excessive degradation or accumulation of ECM is also associated with the etiology of diseases ranging from cardiovascular and musculo-skeletal diseases to cancer and fibrosis (Lu et al., 2011; Theocharis et al., 2019) .",

To advance its core mission of promoting ECM research and support development of the ECM research community, the ASMB established a biennial meeting in 2002. Originally scheduled in November 2020, 'The Matrix in Focus' meeting was eventually held in September 2021 in St. Louis, MO, USA, in a hybrid format that included live streaming and recording of plenary and concurrent sessions to allow for the participation of colleagues around the world unable to attend due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Guest symposia were organized by the Histochemical Society (HCS) and the Tissue Engineering and Regenerative Medicine International Society (TERMIS), emphasizing the interdisciplinary nature of ECM research, and the collaborative tradition of the ASMB. In this post-meeting report, we highlight exciting recent developments in ECM research and discuss the ASMB's experience with organizing a hybrid scientific meeting that welcomed over 350 in-person and remote participants.",

In his presentation, Dr. Lozito showed that spinal cord-derived neural stem cells from lizards release ECM proteases, which generate a microenvironment that allows for ectopic tail growth (Lozito et al., 2021) . Subsequent comparison with mouse neural stem cells showed that mammalian cells did not secrete these proteases. However, excitingly, genetic introduction of these missing proteases into mouse neural stem cells promoted lizard-like regeneration in mammals and points to a potential pathway to creating regeneration-permissive microenvironments to promote tissue restoration.",

Dr. Andrea Page-McCaw (Vanderbilt University, Nashville, USA) explained in her talk that basement membranes surrounding Drosophila gut muscles are especially sensitive to collagen IV crosslinking and other ECM regulators, suggesting active basement membrane remodeling during homeostasis (McCall et al., 2014) . By damaging gut basement membranes, the Page-McCaw lab is setup to genetically identify factors required for basement membrane turnover during homeostasis and repair (Howard et al., 2019) . Interestingly, most basement membrane components and regulators are critical for both repair and homeostasis, raising questions about whether there is an active form of damage detection or whether basement membrane repair is essentially a process of constant renewal.",

This is especially relevant for secreted ECM proteins, where pathogenic variants may result in dominant negative effects due to intracellular retention and therefore, straight gene knockouts may not always be appropriate for disease modeling. Dr. Douglas Gould (University of California, San Francisco, USA) studies the consequences of alterations in the basement membrane protein, collagen IV (Labelle-Dumais et al., 2019). His lab has developed a framework to understand how different variants of the same gene (or closely related genes such as COL4A1 and COL4A2) can have different phenotypic consequences. Recent work from the Gould lab presented at the meeting showed that specific variants of COL4A1 and COL4A2 resulted in impaired secretion leading to intracellular accumulation of the proteins and triggering an endoplasmic-reticulum (ER) stress response; this in turn causes haploinsufficiency in the ECM through a loss of function or pathogenic gain-of-function of secreted and deposited collagen IV (Labelle-Dumais et al., 2019).",

            "text": "In the second part of his talk, Dr. Gould (see above) discussed the importance of identifying patients with COL4A1 or COL4A2 variants that result in the intracellular retention of these proteins, since these patients could potentially benefit from small-molecule therapeutics aimed at promoting the secretion of retained mutant proteins (Hayashi et al., 2018) . Indeed, such a treatment could be effective, but only if variants of COL4A1 and COL4A2 result in intracellular retention without affecting protein functionality. To this aim, Dr. Gould and his team are currently mapping the functional relevance of collagen IV domains. Pathogenic variants of other members of the collagen IV family, including COL4A3, COL4A4, COL4A5, can cause Alport syndrome resulting in renal failure (Funk et al., 2018) . Some of these mutations generate a premature termination codon (PTC) triggering nonsense-mediated mRNA decay or resulting in truncated proteins unable to form functional collagen IV trimers. Small molecules stimulating PTC readthrough have previously been developed for muscular dystrophies or cystic fibrosis. Dr. Kohei Omachi (Washington University, St. Louis, USA) tested for the first time their efficacy on the suppression of collagen IV PTC variants. To do so, Dr. Omachi developed an in vitro luciferase-based screening system and a collagen-IV-assembly assay and demonstrated that some of these PTC readthrough drugs indeed increased collagen IV translation and some, but not all, COL4A5 variants could assemble into functional trimers (Omachi et al., 2021) . This opens the possibility that a subset of Alport syndrome patients may benefit from personalized treatment approaches using drugs promoting PTC readthrough.",

As an alternative, gene therapy has become feasible either by correcting single nucleotide variants or by introducing functional equivalents of aberrant ECM proteins using adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) (Mendell et al., 2021) . Dr. Karen McKee from the Yurchenco lab (Rutgers University, New Brunswick, USA) presented an innovative design of a 'minilaminin' to ameliorate skeletal muscle dystrophy, which was small enough to be packaged by AAVs (Reinhard et al., 2017) . When this construct was delivered into dystrophic mice, grip strength improved significantly. With the future use of tissue-specific promoters, it will be exciting to see how AAV-based therapies can be deployed to ameliorate connective tissue disorders in a tissue-specific and even cell type-specific manner.",

Using particle image velocimetry, the Yamada lab measured significant deformation of the ECM in front of a fibroblast migrating through 3D collagen matrices. Using this technique, the Yamada lab identified a unique 3D migration cycle that is not predicted by observations of 2D motility (Doyle et al., 2021) .

In her talk, Dr. Chang examined collagen I uptake and found that cells take up exogenous collagen in a circadian manner and recycle them back into the ECM where it contributes to new fibrils, rather than simply degrading internalized collagen. She also showed that the endosome decides the fate of collagen (monomeric secretion/fibril formation), highlighting the tight cellular control over collagen fibrillogenesis and new perspectives to treating fibrotic conditions (Chang et al., 2021) .",

Using mouse and chicken models, she determined that downregulation of type III collagen increases metastasis and leads to straight, rather than the curly collagen fibers, an ECM phenotype associated with dormancy (Di Martino et al., 2021) .

Specifically, Dr. Brown's group found that viscoelasticity increased after injury and decreased in fibrotic tissue. Using microgels of defined viscoelastic properties, Dr. Brown identified a reciprocal relationship where cell stiffness increases as microgels become less viscous.
