Various surfaces have a long history of antimicrobial properties and are well described for the prevention of bacterial infections. However, their effect on many viruses has not been studied in depth. In the context of COVID-19, several surfaces, including copper (Cu) and silver (Ag) coatings have been described as efficient antiviral measures that can easily be implemented to slow viral transmission. In this study, we detected antiviral properties against Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) on surfaces, which were coated with Cu by magnetron sputtering as thin Cu films or as Cu/Ag ultrathin bimetallic nanopatches. However, no effect of Ag on viral titers was observed, in clear contrast to its well-known antibacterial properties. Further enhancement of Ag ion release kinetics based on an electrochemical sacrificial anode mechanism did not increase antiviral activity. These results clearly demonstrate that Cu and Ag thin film systems display significant differences in antiviral and antibacterial properties which need to be considered upon implementation.",

Beside applications of these metals in numerous consumer products they are used in various biomaterials or healthcare settings to prevent bacterial colonization of implants and devices or to support hospital hygiene procedures to reduce hospital-acquired infections. Especially the pandemic spread of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) causing the Coronavirus Disease 19 (COVID-19) has exemplified the requirement for effective public health intervention strategies that contribute to controlling virus transmission. However, the development of antiviral surfaces which are able to inactivate adherent virus particles and thereby hinder virus transmission from contaminated surfaces is challenging due to the different inherent properties of microbes compared to viruses.",

Ag + ions interact with a variety of biomolecules within a cell such as cell membrane and cell wall components, thiol ligands, e.g., sulfhydryl groups of metabolic enzymes, or nucleic acids, and others. Furthermore, reactive oxygen species (ROS) are generated due to Ag + ions which leads to harmful oxidative stress effects 2,7,8 . In general, consequences are biomolecule damage and subsequent cellular dysfunctions which finally inhibit bacterial proliferation up to bactericidal effects. The antibacterial efficiency of Ag can be enhanced by an increase in the Ag + releasing surface area by using e.g., Ag nanoparticles 9 . In addition, recently, we presented a concept to enhance Ag + release kinetics based on an electrochemical sacrificial anode mechanism 10-12 . By combination of Ag with a more noble metal (Au, Pt,",

            "text": "The results were achieved using different sputtered thin film surfaces (for details see Experimental Methods): (I) continuous and dense thin films of Ag and Cu (thickness 50 nm) and (II) nanostructured surfaces with high surface areas. The nanostructured surfaces were synthesized by (a) sequentially depositing Ag on Pt, Cu on Ag or (b) by co-sputtering Ag and Pt as well as Cu and Ag. We call the resulting surface structures \"nanopatches\", i.e., nanoislands which are formed by the two metals. A schematic workflow is depicted in Fig. 1 . In case of sequential sputtering (Ag on Pt, Cu on Ag) the elements tend to be more separated as compared to co-sputtering which tends to mix elements on the atomic scale (Ag & Pt, Cu & Ag) and rather forms an alloy (forced solid solution) compared to the co-existence of elemental films (Ag on Pt, Cu on Ag). The latter is expected to have better sacrificial anode properties. We synthesized nanopatches of two different thicknesses, which offer different volumes of material (e.g., thin Ag/Pt vs. thick Ag/Pt) for releasing metal ions ( Table 1) . Examples of scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of the nanoscale films are shown in Fig. 2 . The 50 nm thick films are continuous and show different nanocrystalline surface microstructures: the Ag film is rougher and shows larger grains ( Fig. 2A ) as compared to the Cu film (Fig. 2B) . The SEM and TEM images ( Fig. 2C -F) of nanopatches (Ag, Ag & Pt, Ag & Cu) show that these nanostructures are discontinuous. They can be regarded as immobilized nanoparticles and thus offer a larger surface area than the continuous films. A detailed TEM investigation of the nanostructure of Ag-Pt nanopatches can be found in reference 12 .",

            "text": "After demonstrating antibacterial effects of sputtered Ag and Cu surfaces as well as ionic Ag and Cu solutions, in accordance with previous results, we aimed in a next step to analyze potential antiviral effects of these surfaces against SARS-CoV-2. Viral contamination was mimicked upon inoculation of SARS-CoV-2 onto surfaces for either 1 h or 24 h, before viral titers were determined as TCID 50 /mL (Fig. 5) . A pronounced antiviral efficacy was observed for thin Cu films sputtered on Si/SiO 2 pieces after 1 h and 24 h of incubation reducing viral titers for 3 log 10 and 4.5 log 10 , respectively, whereas Ag films did not reduce viral titers (Fig. 5A ). In contrast, sputtered Ag surfaces only marginally and not significantly affected viral titers upon 24 h exposure. ICP-MS analysis suggested that Cu ions in the range of 10,000-14,200 \u00b5mol/L are released from these films during 24 h, indicating that this amount is sufficient for efficient inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 ( Supplementary Fig. 1 ). While Ag nanopatches did not affect viral infectivity, nanopatches with a thick layer of Cu reduced viral titers by 1 log 10 when incubated together with SARS-CoV-2 for 24 h (Fig. 5B) , resulting in an ion release of around 720 \u00b5mol/L ( Supplementary  Fig. 1 ). Interestingly, Cu & Ag and Cu on Ag nanopatches enhanced the antiviral properties of solely Cu, with a significant antiviral effect after 24 h, despite similar amounts of Cu being released (870 \u00b5mol/L, Supplementary  Fig. 1 ). This could be related to the improved electrochemical Cu ion release mechanism in the sacrificial anode structure, where Cu can be easily oxidized and released to the medium as Cu ions, due to the presence of Ag, support the reduction process. Thin layers reduced viral titers by 2.2 log 10 , whereas thick layers increased virus inactivation resulting in reduction factors of 3.9 log 10 (Fig. 5C ). There was no difference in the antiviral effect detected between co-and sequentially deposited nanopatches. This demonstrates that pure Cu films offer the highest antiviral effect (Fig. 5A) , which correlates to the highest release of ions (13,000 \u00b5mol/L, Supplementary  Fig. 1 ). In contrast, co-deposited and sequentially deposited Ag-Pt nanopatches did not reduce viral infectivity within 1 h incubation. A mild, but not significant antiviral effect (1 log 10 reduction of viral titers) was observed after 24 h incubation with thin Ag & Pt and thin Ag on Pt nanopatches (Fig. 5D ). In order to further examine the observation that Ag-coated surfaces do not affect viral infectivity, we used silver acetate solutions (AgAc) as a reference to test antiviral properties of Ag at higher ion concentrations as compared to what can be released from a thin film surface or a nanopatch structure. We included concentrations ranging from 1 \u00b5g/mL up to 50 \u00b5g/mL Ag and inoculated the solution with SARS-CoV-2 containing supernatant for 1 h or 24 h before determining viral infectivity as TCID 50 /mL. Only concentrations equal to or higher than 25 \u00b5g/mL displayed antiviral properties www.nature.com/scientificreports/ and completely abolished infectivity of SARS-CoV-2, however, only upon prolonged incubation of 24 h (Fig. 5E ). In contrast, virus exposure towards CuSO 4 solution in a similar experimental setup had no effect on viral titers (Fig. 5F ). In conclusion, we demonstrate a clear antiviral effect of Cu-coated surfaces against SARS-CoV-2 within 1 h exposure, whereas Ag-coated surfaces did not influence viral infectivity.",

Fomite transmission via contaminated surfaces was described for a variety of microbes, including several viruses and has been discussed in the context of COVID-19. Even though surfaces are believed to play a minor role for the spread of SARS-CoV-2, public health intervention strategies still rely on disinfectant procedures in order to reduce viral transmission. Various surface coatings exhibiting topographically and/or chemically induced antimicrobial activity have been suggested, including nanostructured materials as well as materials containing antimicrobial agents (e.g. antibiotics, antiviral drugs, nanoparticles) such as commercially available antibacterial/ www.nature.com/scientificreports/ antiviral foils, textiles, paints, and many more 19, 20 . Although disinfection can be effective in the prevention of infection spread, the biologically active agents of many widely used surface and hand disinfectants might also be hazardous to humans and the environment, especially at prolonged application or misuse. In particular, skin and ocular irritation as well as chemical burns to the respiratory track might occur. Disruption of the normal skin flora, which normally represents a protection barrier to harmful agents, can even enhance the risk of infection 21 .",

            "text": "In line with van Doremalen et al., SARS-CoV-2 was less stable on sputtered Cu surfaces compared to all other thin films of this study 18 . A thicker film led to a more pronounced antiviral effect. Cu nanostructures in contrast reduced the antiviral effect, which can be attributed to the reduced amount of released Cu ions. Interestingly, combining Cu with Ag by either co-sputtering or sequentially depositing Cu on Ag, strengthened the antiviral www.nature.com/scientificreports/ effects for the nanoscale structures (Cu nanopatch in comparison to Ag-Cu nanopatch) especially after prolonged incubation of 24 h as monitored by limited dilution assays. In contrast, thin films of pure Ag or Ag-based sacrificial anode nanopatches (Ag in combination with Pt) displayed no significant capacity to inactivate SARS-CoV-2 ( Fig. 5B-D) , despite efficient release of Ag ions. Ionic control experiments demonstrated that a minimum concentration of \u2265 25 \u00b5g/mL is necessary to significantly reduce viral titers when incubated for 24 h. Reducing the silver acetate concentration or incubation period completely abolished any antiviral effects (Fig. 5E ). This means that only very high concentrations of Ag ions have an effect on SARS-CoV-2. In the past, most of nanoparticles (NPs) used for studies on antiviral activities were made of Ag (for review see 20, 21 ) For instance, HIV-1 infectivity was inhibited at concentrations of 25 \u00b5g Ag/mL and above 19, 21 . Recently, Jeremiah et al. reported that Ag NPs (10 nm) were already effective in lower concentrations inhibiting extracellular SARS-CoV-2 at concentrations between 1 and 10 \u00b5g/mL 22 , however, it is possible that nanoparticles exert an additional particle effect on viruses after binding such as steric inhibition. Also, a mixture of nanoparticles in solution containing Au-NP (1 \u00b5g/mL) and Ag-NP (5 \u00b5g/mL) was effective against SARS-CoV-2 and influenza viruses, however, this mixture also contained large amounts (60 \u00b5g/mL) of ZnO-NPs and additionally ClO 2 23 . In general, it must be considered that studies with nanoparticles are not directly comparable to studies on thin films (or thin bulk material) due to several facts such as enlarged surface, high ion release, uptake into cells, electrostatic interaction, steric interaction in case of the small particles, and other factors. Our results on thin film surfaces, nanopatches and ionic solutions clearly indicate differences between antiviral and antibacterial activities of Ag. For inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 about tenfold higher concentrations of Ag ions are required compared to efficient antibacterial concentrations. The reason may be related to the difference in the nature of viruses vs. bacteria. As living organisms, bacteria offer much more Ag-sensitive metabolic processes such as energy generation or cell proliferation compared to a virus particle. Furthermore, some bacteria such as S. aureus exhibit a significant inherent tolerance of growth at high Cu concentrations 24 . However, a copper sulfate solution up to 50 \u00b5g/mL did not inactivate SARS-CoV-2 (Fig. 5F ). In our study the ionic Ag and Cu solutions had similar concentration up to 50 \u00b5g metal/mL to allow www.nature.com/scientificreports/ direct comparison. Whereas ionic Ag is antibacterial at concentrations of \u2265 1 \u00b5g/mL, ionic Cu is required at much higher concentrations to inhibit bacterial growth (e.g. 10 mM CuSO 4 ). Several groups observed similar differences in antibacterial efficiency between Ag and Cu ions [24] [25] [26] , however, at lower total ion concentrations due to the water test medium 26 . Thus, at equimolar concentrations Ag ions shows better antibacterial performance compared to Cu ions. Virus inhibition by soluble Cu ions might require higher concentrations above the used maximal values (50 \u00b5g/mL) in our experiments. In contrast to ionic species, antibacterial and antiviral activities of solid Ag and Cu sputtered surfaces have led to different results. Nanopatches of pure Ag neither exhibit antibacterial nor antiviral activities. Obviously, Ag ion release is insufficient under these experimental conditions. To overcome this limited Ag ion release, the more active ion-releasing sacrificial anode surfaces can be used as they exhibit much better antibacterial www.nature.com/scientificreports/ efficiency even at lower total Ag content 11, 12 as was also observed here for Ag/Pt samples (Fig. 3) . However, even these antibacterial Ag/Pt samples failed to induce any antiviral effect which indicates again the need of higher Ag ion concentrations to reach antiviral activity. Remarkably, our study shows that solid-state Cu either as a dense film or as nanopatches is able to induce antiviral activity, but not solid-state Ag. The antiviral effects are dependent on the total Cu amount (thickness of the sputtered Cu and ion release) and on the time of sample exposure.",

Our results showed that the combination of Cu and Ag (Cu & Ag nanopatches) exerted significantly more antiviral activity than similar nanopatches consisting of Cu or Ag alone. This effect can be attributed to the enhanced Cu ion release of Cu & Ag nanopatches concurrent with a profound decrease in Ag-ion release compared to Ag nanopatches. Apparently, the presence of silver is nevertheless necessary to enable antiviral effects via nanopatches. These findings suggest that electrochemical processes such as a sacrificial anode effect may play important roles. However, the exact mechanisms for this still need to be clarified in further studies.",

Bacterial tests were performed with Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus, DSMZ 1104) obtained from the German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures (Braunschweig, Germany). S. aureus cultures were grown overnight in brain-heart infusion broth (BHI broth, bioMerieux, Lyon, France) at 37 \u00b0C using a shaking water bath (JULABO GmbH, Seelbach, Germany) and bacterial concentrations were determined by turbidity measurements (Densichek turbidity photometer, bioMerieux).

Briefly, 30 \u00b5L of a bacterial solution in BHI broth containing 10 4 cells per mL (CFU/ mL) were placed in the middle of each test sample followed by incubation for 24 h in a humid chamber (water saturated atmosphere) under cell culture conditions (37 \u00b0C, 5% CO 2 ). Subsequently, the drops were aspirated, serially diluted (1:10 4 ) and plated on Columbia blood agar plates (bioMerieux) for quantitative analysis of planktonic bacteria. Qualitative analysis of the adherent bacteria was performed by SYTO-9 staining (Molecular Probes, Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany) and detected by fluorescence microscopy (BX61 microscope, Olympus, Hamburg, Germany).",
