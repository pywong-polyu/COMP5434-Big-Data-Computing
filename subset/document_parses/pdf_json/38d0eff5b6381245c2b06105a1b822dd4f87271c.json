We first performed quality check and filtered out low-quality sequences that met any of the following criteria: 1) sequences with less than 90% genome coverage; 2) genomes with too many mutations (defined as having >20 nucleotide mutations relative to the Wuhan reference), which would violate the SARS-CoV-2 molecular clock at the time of study; 3) genomes with more than ten ambiguous bases; and 4) genomes with clustered mutations, defined as mutations in close proximity to one another. These are the standard quality assessment parameters utilized in NextClade (https://clades.nextstrain.org). The current study was based on the 2.17 million global viral genomes available as of 30 June 2021.",

For SARS-CoV-2 lineage development, between December 2020 to January 2021, the prevalence of B. 1.1.7 (B.1.1.7 samples/all sequenced samples) increased from 0% in late December 2020 to ~ 60% in late January 2021, replacing the majority of other lineages (Fig. 4B ) (Note: as mentioned in the results section 3, the early growth of the B.1.1.7 sub-lineage might be missed out from the genome surveillance owing to the low sampling density in December), suggesting the major driving force for the sharp wave was the quick expansion of the B.1.1.7 variant, which was shown to be more transmissible than previously existing other lineages (2) (3) (4) .

The originally reported B.1.1.7 was characterized by 17 mutations including amino acid replacements and deletions on the spike protein (S), open-reading-frame-1ab (ORF1ab), open-reading-frame-8 (ORF8) and the nucleoprotein (5). These mutations might play a role in ACE2 receptor binding or neutralizing antibody escape (6, 7). One recent study has investigated the spatial invasion dynamics of B.1.1.7 in the UK, and the results of this study indicated that early B.1.1.7 growth rates were related with lineage export frequencies from a dominant source location (8). It remains unclear how B.1.1.7 could quickly spread to all the countries in Europe in spite of the strict lockdown including restrictions on international travels since December 2020 in almost all the European countries. In Germany, regular large-scale genomic surveillance was initiated in early January 2021. With SARS-CoV-2 samples sequenced locally and with virus genomes shared on GISAID (9), we have routinely carried out genomic epidemiology analyses to investigate local, national and international virus spreading conditions, and monitor the evolution of existing variants and the emergence of new variants. Through joint efforts in genomic surveillance with Czech and Poland partners, we detected that in the B.1.1.7 samples in the Czech Republic, around 95% samples carried two extra mutations: N_G204P and ORF8_68stop. In Germany, more than 30% of B.1.1.7 samples showed these two extra mutations as well. More detailed analysis of international samples revealed that this B.1.1.7-N:G204P-ORF8:K68stop sub-lineage has been widely distributed in Europe. Here, we describe the detection, characterization, transmission, evolution and functional analyses of this B.1.1.7 sub-lineage, and the spreading pattern of B.1.1.7 in Europe in January 2021 when B.1.1.7 got detected in most European countries.

To investigate the source and possible transmission routes of this B.1.1.7 sublineage at early stage, we analyzed all the B.1.1.7 samples belonging to this sub-lineage collected from all around Europe till end of January 2021.

Discussion In this article we describe the detection, characterization, transmission, evolution and functional evaluation of the B.1.1.7-N:G204P-ORF8:68stop sub-lineage that emerged in the European continent in November 2020 and spread widely in many European countries as of 30 June 2021.

In late December 2020 or early January 2021, it spread to the Czech Republic and quickly became the local predominant SARS-CoV-2 variant replacing the majority of previously existing variants, and then spread to other European countries. Furthermore, we detected evolution of this B.1.1.7 sub-lineage, characterized by samples carrying two extra spike mutations A701V and D138Y on the genetic background of this B.1.1.7 sub-lineage.

The results indicated the B.1.1.7_S itself showed no replication advantage or reduced neutralization sensitivity compared to the B.1.1.7_O. This explains the co-existence of the two variants in many European countries as shown in Figure 1. However, for the B.1.1.7_S+, reduced neutralization sensitivity was observed, indicating potential for immune evasion (24-26). At the same time, the B.1.1.7_S+ isolate showed decreased replication fitness compared to the other B.1.1.7 variants, which explains its limited expansion in Europe and low ratio of detection in Germany (less than 0.1% of all B.1.1.7 as of June 30, 2021). Furthermore, using virus genome surveillance data we have estimated the cross-country spreading pattern of B.1.1.7 in Europe in January 2021 when B.1.1.7 started being frequently detected in most European countries. We find the spreading pattern of B.1.1.7 throughout Europe was shown as high export frequencies from the major source locations, UK and Czech Republic, which is comparable to the early spreading pattern of B.1.1.7 in the UK (8) and in a few other countries at the national level (17, 18, 27). The identification of this B.1.1.7 sub-lineage has solved an important puzzle about the spreading of B.1.1.7 in Europe. The SARS-CoV-2 lineage B.1.1.7 was first detected in the UK in late 2020, and then spread to other countries. It is commonly acknowledged that geographic distance and traffic connection to the epicenter play an important role in the spreading pattern of virus (28, 29). Usually, in the region closer to the epicenter, the virus would emerge and spread earlier. In most countries in Europe, the B.1.1.7 wave peaked at the end of March or early April. Among European countries, Czech Republic is geographically farther away from the UK than most other countries, but in January 2021 the B.1.1.7 had already become the predominant SARS-CoV-2 lineage there, which was earlier than most other countries. It was difficult to explain the contradiction between the geographical distribution and the time line of",

Perhaps driven by various transient demographic and epidemiological factors, such as opening of ski resorts and other human mobilities related with vacation or family gathering, or local high incidence rate that may lead to escalating growth rate of SARS-CoV-2, this B.1.1.7 sub-lineage rapidly increased in the Czech Republic and then spread to a variety of other countries. The wide spread of this B.1.1.7 sub-lineage was related to the pandemic waves in the Czech Republic in early 2021, and played a role in driving the B.1.1.7 wave in various other European countries, such as Austria, Slovakia, Germany and Denmark. These findings add to the understanding about the pandemic development in Europe and could possibly help to prevent similar scenarios in future. Also, these findings emphasize the importance of international collaboration on virus mutant surveillance, not only for SARS-CoV-2, also for other epidemic viruses or bacteria.",
