            "text": "Previous evidence has shown that deaths by suicide can increase during infectious disease outbreaks. Suicides increased during the 1918-20 influenza pandemic in the USA, 1 and suicide rates increased among adults aged 65 years and older during the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in Hong Kong. [2] [3] [4] In Australia, dynamic modelling has indicated a 25-50% increase in suicides annually that could increase current nationwide suicides from 3000 to 3750-4500 deaths per annum in the next 5 years. 5 The second monthly suicide data report of the Coroners Court of Victoria, released on Oct 5, 2020, indicated that the number of deaths by suicide in the state of Victoria, Australia, in 2020, was four less than those reported on Sept 30, 2019. 6 The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that causes COVID-19 and the associated COVID-19 pandemic might increase deaths by suicide by affecting vulnerable groups and the economy. 7-9 Specifically, mechanisms might include increased anxiety, depression, alcohol use, or entrapment due to increased isolation, uncertainty, domestic violence, economic hardship, and reduced social opportunities. 9 However, there is little evidence that being infected with a coronavirus directly influences suicidal behaviour. 10 Monitoring and reporting the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on real-time suicide mortality is an important research priority. 7,11 Although suicide rates could rise, this is not inevitable because of the public health responses that might mitigate suicide risk. 7 Australia first reported SARS-CoV-2 in the state of Victoria on Jan 25, 2020. The state of Queensland in Australia first detected a case on Jan 29, 2020, and declared a public health emergency the same day. WHO characterised COVID-19 as a pandemic on March 11. 12 On April 2, the Queensland Government issued a directive restricting leaving principal residences only for essential needs, allowing outdoor gatherings of only two people or with household members, receiving only two visitors at residences, and prohibiting gathering in non-residences. On April 9, the Queensland Government prohibited nonessential business unable to be conducted remotely. These restrictions began to ease in three stages, from May 15, June 1, and July 3.",
