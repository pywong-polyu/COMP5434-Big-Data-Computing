To study these responses, it is essential to identify protein-derived MHC-II peptide ligands that constitute epitopes for T cell recognition. However, generating cells expressing single MHC-II alleles and isolating these proteins for use in peptide elution or binding studies is time consuming. Here, we express human MHC alleles (HLA-DR4 and HLA-DQ6) as native, noncovalent \u03b1\u03b2 dimers on yeast cells for direct flow cytometry-based screening of peptide ligands from selected antigens. We demonstrate rapid, accurate identification of DQ6 ligands from pre-pro-hypocretin, a narcolepsy-related immunogenic target. We also identify 20 DR4-binding SARS-CoV-2 spike peptides homologous to SARS-CoV-1 epitopes, and one spike peptide overlapping with the reported SARS-CoV-2 epitope recognized by CD4 + T cells from unexposed individuals carrying DR4 subtypes. Our method is optimized for immediate application upon the emergence of novel pathogens.",

            "text": "CD4 + T cell responses are crucial drivers of defensive immunity against infection; however, they can also cause autoimmune responses when tolerance is broken. These T cells respond to antigens via interactions between T cell receptors (TCRs) and antigen-derived peptides bound to heterodimeric (\u03b1/\u03b2) major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC-II) molecules on the surface of professional antigen-presenting cells (APCs) [1, 2] . Identification of T cell responses specific for a target antigen often requires intensive screening of overlapping peptides covering the candidate protein in a T cell assay. The use of characterized peptide/MHC complexes as probes for TCR binding or TCRmediated T cell activation allows further assessment of reactive T cell clones. For example, we and others have applied both in vitro T cell assays and ex vivo peptide/MHC-II probes to identify CD4 + T cell clones targeting a neurotransmitter (hypocretin, HCRT) in narcolepsy patients [3] [4] [5] . Recently, similar analyses have identified CD4 + T cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins [6] [7] [8] [9] ; however, a lack of well-characterized MHC-II ligands derived from these viral antigens limits the examination of reactive T cell clones.",

There are two major experimental approaches to identify MHC-II ligands. One uses mass spectrometry to quantify peptides eluted from MHC-II molecules that are immunoprecipitated from lysed cells [20] [21] [22] [23] . The other detects the binding of synthesized peptides to soluble, recombinant MHC-II proteins [5, 13, [24] [25] [26] [27] . Currently, to identify peptides bound by a particular MHC-II allelic protein via either method, it is optimal to generate cell lines that express only this allele, as primary cells in humans are typically heterozygous and codominantly express both alleles from each of the HLA-DR, HLA-DQ, and HLA-DP genes that encode the three isotypes of human leukocyte antigen (HLA). In addition, both methods require purification of the expressed MHC-II protein. Based on our previous experience [5, 24, 28] , these steps typically take up to 4 months, significantly limiting the speed of empirical studies.",

            "text": "Here, we develop a new methodology that allows elimination of the labor-intensive expression/purification steps by taking advantage of yeast display [29] . As single-cell eukaryotes, yeast cells have the fast cloning capability of Escherichia coli and are equipped with posttranslational modification machinery similar to that in mammalian cells [29, 30] . Therefore, linking an exogenous protein (e.g., MHC-II) to a native yeast protein on the yeast cell surface offers a fast way to investigate the function of the exogenous protein. To express MHC-II alleles, including DR and DQ, as noncovalent heterodimers without an interchain linker on the yeast cell surface, we replace the transmembrane domains with leucine zipper (LZ) dimerization motifs [31, 32] ; this LZ fusion facilitates pairing of \u03b1/\u03b2 chains that are encoded by a bidirectional expression construct and secreted separately by yeast cells [33, 34] . We prove that both the DR and DQ constructs are correctly folded without the necessity for covalently linked peptides and are functional in binding exogenous peptides. We then design a competition assay that enables rapid identification of MHC-II peptide ligands from protein antigens (RIPPA), using HCRT and the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) as model antigens. The quick setup time (<1 month) for the RIPPA in vitro peptide-binding assay allows efficient testing of MHC-II ligands to guide tetramer synthesis and expedite downstream investigation of cellmediated immune responses that are relevant to disease. These characteristics are particularly useful in the setting of novel, rapidly spreading diseases, such as COVID-19.",

            "text": "Leucine zippers enhance MHC-II expression on yeast cells independent of peptide ligands Professional APCs express MHC-II molecules as \u03b1/\u03b2 heterodimeric membrane proteins initially associated with the chaperone invariant chain (Ii) in the endoplasmic reticulum. The peptidebinding groove of nascent MHC-II is occupied by a region of Ii that is proteolytically trimmed via the endosomal pathway to yield the CLIP peptide [35] . An antigenic peptide capable of binding to a given MHC-II allelic protein can replace CLIP through a peptide exchange process. This process most often takes place in the late endosomal MHC-II-enriched compartment (MIIC), where it is typically catalyzed by HLA-DM [36] , although cell surface exchange may occur under some conditions [37] . It is likely that mass spectrometry underestimates the abundance of certain MHC-II binders in the eluted ligandome, when these binders are outcompeted by highly abundant or high-affinity peptides due to physiologic (e.g., intracellular cleavage or DM effects) or experimental (e.g., differences between model cell lines and primary cells) conditions. Therefore, to explore all possible MHC-II ligands from candidate antigens, it is ideal to evaluate MHC-II binding of overlapping peptides spanning the entire antigen. When recombinant MHC-II ectodomains are used in binding studies, a specific peptide ligand is typically linked to the N terminus of the MHC-II \u03b2 chain to stabilize the \u03b1/\u03b2 dimers. A linker cleavage step is then necessary to ensure the production of an exchangeable placeholder peptide for a peptide-binding assay [24] .",

            "text": "To avoid the requirement for the linker cleavage step in our peptide-binding assay using yeast display of MHC-II, we first utilized an \"empty\" construct expressed by yeast. We used DR4 (DRA*01:01/DRB1*04:01) as a representative DR allele, along with an influenza hemagglutinin (HA) 306-318 peptide-linked construct that was previously examined in yeast [34] . Importantly, a bidirectional GAL1-10 promoter was used to direct simultaneous expression of the \u03b1 and \u03b2 chains from a yeast shuttle vector (Fig. 1a) . Unlike the single-chain format of recombinant DR proteins used in several previous attempts at yeast display [16, [38] [39] [40] [41] , the noncovalent native format no longer requires mutation of MHC-II to facilitate protein folding. Considering the potential instability of the \"empty\" DR4 protein, we included LZ motifs [31, 32] in two additional constructs to facilitate dimerization (Fig. 1a) . Previously, LZ Fos/Jun motifs were used to allow \u03b1/\u03b2 pairing of a single-chain DR protein in yeast, although the resulting protein was not functional for peptide binding [39] . In all four constructs developed herein, the DR4 \u03b2 chain ectodomain with or without the Fos motif was engineered to be located upstream of the yeast AGA2 gene and followed by an HA epitope tag, while the \u03b1 chain ectodomain with or without the Jun motif was designed to be secreted from yeast (Fig. 1a) . Successful folding and \u03b1/\u03b2 pairing can yield a functional DR4 protein expressed as a fusion to the yeast native surface protein agglutinin, which is composed of the Aga1p and Aga2p subunits (Fig. 1b) .",

After induction of protein expression, we detected properly assembled DR4 on the surface of all four strains by costaining with two antibodies, one specific for DR\u03b1\u03b2 (clone L243) and the other specific for the HA tag (Fig. 1c) . As expected, the LZ enhanced the surface level of folded DR4 by 5\u00d7 and 3\u00d7 for the peptide-linked and \"empty\" constructs, respectively, as measured by flow cytometry (Fig. 1d) . This improvement was attributed to \u03b1/ \u03b2 dimerization facilitated by the LZ and not to yeast protein production, as the level of Aga2p expression, indicated by staining of the HA tag, were not correlated with the levels of folded dimers (Fig. 1d) . Notably, as L243 is typically specific for stable DR4 heterodimers in association with peptides, the similar levels of \"empty\" and peptide-linked DR4 stained by L243 implied that the \"empty\" binding grooves were likely occupied by peptides derived from the cultured yeast cells [41] rather than being truly empty (herein, quotation marks are used to indicate that the constructs were genetically empty). To further confirm that both chains of DR4 with the LZ motifs were expressed by yeast, we simultaneously stained the \u03b1 and \u03b2 chains. Costaining of the c-Myc-tag at the C terminus of the \u03b1 chain (Fig. 1a ) and the HA-tag at the C terminus of the DR\u03b2-Aga2p fusion confirmed the expression of both the \u03b1and \u03b2-encoding open reading frames ( Supplementary  Fig. 1 ). The presence of both chains on the surface was also consistent with the detection of correctly folded DR\u03b1\u03b2 by the L243 antibody (Fig. 1c) .",

Although the presence of linked peptides may influence protein expression, the successful display of \"empty\" MHC-II as a noncovalent heterodimer enabled further evaluation of the capacity of MHC-II molecules to accommodate exogenously added peptides. \"Empty\" MHC-II on yeast binds specific peptides under various conditions Physiologic peptide loading occurs in the acidic MIIC (pH~5) at human body temperature (37\u00b0C) [35] . Yeast cells express proteins at 30\u00b0C in culture systems with pH values ranging from 5 to 7. To evaluate yeast display as a robust system to study MHC-II peptide binding, we examined various binding conditions. Yeast incubated with an indicator biotinylated peptide ligand consistently yielded 2-3\u00d7 higher biotin signals than yeast incubated with the irrelevant biotinylated peptide control at pH 5.0 vs pH 7.4 and at 30\u00b0C vs 37\u00b0C (Fig. 3a, b and Supplementary Fig. 3a) . The capacity to bind exogenous peptides validated the functional integrity of noncovalent MHC-II \u03b1/\u03b2 heterodimers on yeast. Incubation conditions of pH 5.0 (physiological binding pH) and 30\u00b0C (habitual temperature for yeast survival) were then used in subsequent experiments. Many endpoint approaches, such as the capture ELISA-based peptide loading assay [24, 25, 28] , often require >10 h of incubation to reach equilibrium. These approaches rely on competition between competitor peptides and an indicator peptide to characterize relative MHC-II binding capacities, i.e., the half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50), rather than absolute kinetic parameters, i.e., on/off rates and dissociation constant (K d ) values. Similarly, the flow cytometry-based yeast display approach was optimized for endpoint comparison of relative binding capacities (Fig. 3b) . Notably, given the assumption of a pseudo-first-order reaction (see \"Methods\"), we can estimate Proper folding and surface expression of peptide-linked or \"empty\" DQ6 with a LZ domain in yeast. a Gene construct used for expression of the noncovalent DQ6 ectodomain with or without specific peptides covalently linked to the DQ6\u03b2 N terminus. In the peptidelinked constructs, we included two peptides, HCRT 87-97 and HA 273-286 , whose binding to DQ6 has been well characterized, and a positive control Ii peptide, CLIP 87-101 . Unlike in the DR construct, the \u03b1 chain upstream of the Fos LZ motif was fused directly to the N terminus of the Aga2p subunit. b Schematic illustration of appropriately assembled peptide-linked or \"empty\" DQ6 as a fusion to the yeast surface protein agglutinin (similar to Fig. 1b) . c Expression of peptide/DQ6 or \"empty\" DQ6 on the surface of yeast, as analyzed by flow cytometry (as in Fig. 1c , except that an anti-DQ\u03b1\u03b2 antibody (clone SPV-L3) was used). d Comparison of DQ6 expression levels in different yeast transformants. The fold change in MFI with respect to the background (BG) fluorescence signal was quantified (as in Fig. 1d ). Representative histograms are shown to the right.

R Liu et al. the observed rate constant (k obs ) in a time course experiment ( Fig. 3c and Supplementary Fig. 3b ). Similar to the capture ELISA [24] , the yeast display approach suggested kinetics in which equilibrium was reached after 10 h. Using a 20 h incubation time to approximate the equilibrium binding at each peptide concentration, we calculated the apparent dissociation constant (K d,app ) for the binding of peptides to either \"empty\" MHC-II expressed on yeast ( Fig. 3d and Supplementary Fig. 3c ) or soluble MHC-II ( Supplementary Fig. 3e ). Measurements using the yeast display system can be as good as those using soluble proteins, despite noticeable range differences, compared to kinetic approaches that are optimal for quantification of absolute K d values [27] . Yeast display also differs from other approaches due to the complex microenvironment on the cell surface (nonspecific binding, uneven local distribution, mass-transfer limitation, etc.). However, these differences did not interfere with the determination of relative binding capacities (see below). Using a concentration (20 \u03bcM) of biotinylated indicator peptides that resulted in minimal nonspecific binding (as indicated by the negligible background (BG) staining at \u226420 \u03bcM shown in Supplementary Fig. 3c ), we observed concentration-dependent inhibition of indicator binding in the presence of its nonbiotinylated counterpart on yeast ( Fig. 3e and Supplementary Fig. 3d ). The calculated IC50 values (~30 \u03bcM) were very close to the theoretical value (20 \u03bcM). Importantly, an orthogonal ELISA-based approach using soluble MHC-II validated the yeast display measurements (Supplementary Fig. 3f ). To show the relative binding of competitor peptides, we converted the %Binding value corresponding to the indicator to a % Competition (=100% \u2212 %Binding) value corresponding to the competitor. Of note, when the competitor and indicator were the same peptide, 50%Competition reflected the theoretical value when [competitor]:[indicator] = 1;~75%Competition reflected an empirical average when [competitor]:[indicator] = 10 using both soluble and yeast-displayed MHC-II ( Fig. 3f and Supplementary Fig. 3g, h) . Therefore, we applied two cutoff values (50%Competition and 75% Competition) to estimate how well a tested peptide competitively bound a given MHC-II molecule with reference to the indicator peptide.",

Despite the different conditions, the two empirical results showed a strong correlation (R 2 = 0.6878, Fig. 4b ), which was slightly higher than the correlation (R 2 = 0.5896, Fig. 4c and R 2 = 0.5024, Supplementary  Fig. 4b ) between the data acquired using the RIPPA approach and the prediction by NetMHCIIpan-4.0. Both empirical approaches showed >50%Competition for HCRT 1-15 , HCRT 21-35 , HCRT [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] , HCRT 53-67 , HCRT 57-71 , HCRT 81-95 , and HCRT 85-99 peptides that carry previously determined DQ6-binding registers, whereas RIPPA further showed >75%Competition for HCRT 89-103 (Fig. 4a, b) , yielding 100% coverage of previously determined registers [4, 5, 44] . Titration of [HCRT 89-103 ] in the competition assay suggested that >75%Competition can be obtained by yeast display when [competitor]:[indicator] = 10 ( Fig. 4d) , but using soluble proteins only when [competitor]:[indicator] = 100 ( Fig. 4e and Supplementary Fig. 4c ). Both empirical approaches confirmed HCRT 89-103 as a DQ6 ligand, albeit with the relatively high IC50 suggested by the capture ELISA ( Fig. 4d-f) , consistent with the observation that the HCRT 89-103 amino acid sequence includes the register NHAAGILTM [4, 5, 44] . Notably, although the indicator signal window in the flow cytometric measurements was relatively small (see Fig. 3a, b) , the sensitivity of this approach for the identification of MHC-II ligands was as good as or occasionally even better than that of its orthogonal counterpart, ELISA (Fig. 4b) .",

DRB1*04:01 has a frequency of~10% in the population of European descent and 1-2% in other populations (https://bioinformatics. bethematchclinical.org). The use of a 96-well polymerase chain reaction (PCR) plate enabled simultaneous culture of 96 wells of sufficient yeast cells expressing \"empty\" DR4, and allowed screening for up to 94 nonbiotinylated peptides as competitors (one per well) against the indicator peptide binding to the \"empty\" DR4 expressed on yeast. Eighteen peptides showed >75% Competition, and 34 showed 50-75%Competition by RIPPA (Fig. 5) . A total of 31 of these 52 peptides (59.6%) were predicted to rank in the top 10% by at least one of the two NetMHCIIpan-4.0 algorithms (BA and EL). The insufficient coverage of RIPPAidentified DR4 ligands by prediction was also reflected by the lower correlation (RIPPA vs BA, R 2 = 0.1658; RIPPA vs EL, R 2 = 0.2724; Fig. 6a , b) than that observed in the pre-pro-HCRT analysis (RIPPA vs BA, R 2 = 0.5896, Fig. 4c and RIPPA vs EL, R 2 = 0.5024, Supplementary Fig. 4b) . Notably, 16 peptides predicted to rank in the top 10% by at least one of the two algorithms showed <50% Competition by RIPPA (Fig. 5) .",

Similar to the DQ6-HCRT binding measurements (Fig. 4b, d, e) , RIPPA and ELISA showed noticeable differences for the %Competition (Supplementary Table 1 ) and inhibition curves (see Fig. 6c, d for examples) representing DR4-Spike binding. However, for 16 DR4-binding candidates (excluding S1058-1074) that showed discrepancies between the RIPPA data and computational prediction data, the ELISA method validated the RIPPA method for the identification of all 10 DR4 binders (IC50 ranks in Figs. 6e) and five of the six nonbinders ( Supplementary  Fig. 5a) . A likely RIPPA-identified false positive, S652-668, showed <50%Competition when [competitor]:[indicator] = 100 by ELISA. To eliminate experimental error caused by selection of certain peptides, we synthesized alternative peptides spanning the six nonbinder peptide regions and tested their competitive binding to soluble DR4 or \"empty\" DR4 expressed on yeast. All alternative peptides showed 50%Competition under the experimental conditions ( Supplementary Fig. 5b) , confirming that the corresponding 17-mers were false positives by at least one of the predictions. Assuming the capture ELISA also identified the remaining 113 (=181 \u2212 68) peptides as nonbinders, RIPPA (FDR~4.97%, 9/ . 4 ). RIPPA is thus a better approach to rapidly identify the highest number of lead MHC-II binders for downstream analysis.",

S1 contains N-terminal and C-terminal domains and a receptor-binding domain, which is essential for viral attachment and transmission [46] . The S2 subunit, containing fusion peptides, two heptad repeats (HR1 and HR2) and a central helix, functions to bring viral and cellular membranes into close proximity for fusion and infection [47] . DR4 binders span each of these domains (except for HR2) without particular location or structural preferences, suggesting a wide range of candidate immunogenic targets for vaccine design (Fig. 7a, b) . Seventeen DR4-restricted SARS-CoV-1 S peptides have previously been suggested to contain putative T cell epitopes [13] ; 13/17 (76.5%) of these SARS-CoV-1 S peptides share at least 4 homologous amino acids (aas) with 20 of the 45 SARS-CoV-2 S-derived DR4 binders (Fig. 7c) . Another DR4 binder, S1058-1074 (with a BA~20\u00d7 weaker than that of HA 306-318 , Fig. 6e ), shares 13 aa residues with a SARS-CoV-2 S epitope ( Fig. 7c) that can stimulate CD4 + T cells isolated from an unexposed individual carrying a DR4 allelic variant [6] . These identifications provide the molecular basis for the speculation (based on recent studies [6] [7] [8] [9] ) that cross-reactive memory CD4 + T cells likely arose prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. This initial set of DR4-restricted epitope candidates thus enables peptide/DR4 tetramer synthesis for probing cross-reactive CD4 + T cell clones from DR4+ individuals. Fig. 4a ). The number in front of each peptide indicates the start position in the S precursor. Red: peptides that were ranked in the top 10% by both prediction algorithms and showed >75%Competition by RIPPA; magenta: peptides that were ranked in the top 10% by both prediction algorithms and showed 50-75%Competition by RIPPA; brown: peptides that were ranked in the top 10% by both prediction algorithms and showed <50%Competition by RIPPA; blue: peptides that were ranked below the cutoff (10%) by both prediction algorithms and yielded >75%Competition by RIPPA; cyan: peptides that were ranked below the cutoff by both prediction algorithms and yielded 50-75%Competition; green: peptides that were ranked in the top 10% by either prediction algorithm.

The use of computational algorithms that have been trained on existing peptide elution and binding data is the quickest way to predict MHC-II ligands derived from candidate SARS-CoV-2 antigens for use in T cell assays [48, 49] . Given the false-positive rate [17] [18] [19] [20] and incomplete coverage of ligands from selected antigens in the prediction data, as observed here, it is still essential to experimentally determine MHC-II binding and verify HLA restriction of T cell epitopes prior to downstream experimental and clinical investigations. In this study, we developed a RIPPA method to quickly examine the binding of the spectrum of antigen-derived peptides to a given MHC-II allelic protein displayed by yeast cells. Unlike other experimental setups, this method does not require time-consuming steps, including the construction and preparation of cell lines expressing a single target MHC-II allele and the labor-intensive isolation and preparation of MHC-II proteins. The engineering of MHC \u03b1 and \u03b2 polypeptides as a single-chain fusion to Aga2p in yeast was previously developed, with the aim of establishing a high-throughput surface display platform to study MHC-peptide-TCR interactions. However, under most conditions, point mutations in MHC alleles and covalently linked stabilizer peptides are necessary for appropriate protein folding Supplementary Fig. 5a) . The IC50 values of each competitor calculated from three independent experiments were normalized to those of nonbiotinylated HA 306-318 and shown as means \u00b1 SEMs.",

To display MHC-II molecules in their native heterodimeric form while avoiding unnecessary genetic modifications, we adopted a bidirectional expression construct [33, 34] that enables \u03b1 and \u03b2 chains to be expressed separately in yeast. We also utilized a previously verified LZ dimerization motif [31, 32] to facilitate chain pairing. Our construct yielded \"genetically empty\" yet correctly folded DR or DQ \u03b1/\u03b2 heterodimers anchored at the yeast cell surface to mimic their native counterparts for binding antigenic peptides. Both \"empty\" DR4 and DQ6 proteins were fully functional and accommodated biotinylated indicator peptides under various conditions, allowing experimentation under both the optimum time and pH conditions for MHC-II peptide binding and the habitual temperature for yeast survival. In addition, molecules such as DQ6, which typically rely on DM catalysis to remove a preloaded stabilizer peptide (e.g., CLIP), can spontaneously bind the biotinylated indicator peptide on yeast and be detected using flow cytometry. As described before [33, 41, 51] and demonstrated here, flow cytometric data can be mathematically converted to calculate binding parameters, i.e., k obs , K d,app and IC50. In particular, the advantage of this endpoint measurement for determining the relative binding capacities of different peptides has been demonstrated. These features enable the study of competitive peptide binding at the yeast cell surface and the development of a scalable RIPPA approach for the identification of MHC-II ligands. Here, we validated the efficiency and accuracy of the RIPPA method and then identified DR4 ligands derived from the SARS-CoV-2 S protein as a model antigen.",

Notably, 44 of these DR4 binders were identified by RIPPA (>50%Competition), whereas 32 were predicted by NetMHCII-4.0 (ranked in the top 10% by both the BA and EL algorithms). The relatively lower coverage (71.1% vs 97.8%) in the computational prediction approach reemphasizes the importance of empirical examination of MHC-II ligands. Knowing the capacity of MHC-II molecules to bind peptides derived from multiple domains of a microbial antigen, as demonstrated here for DR4 ligands, provides useful information for vaccine design, particularly vaccines with subunitor peptide-based agents. Viruses, including coronaviruses, mutate naturally for increased fitness [52] . Therefore, combinatorial inclusion of alternative epitopes or selection of candidates with conserved amino acids across mutants or across different strains of the same species of virus is likely optimal for vaccination.",

The c-Myc epitope tag was fused to the C terminus of the Jun motif (plasmid synthesis was performed by GenScript). The backbone yeast shuttle vector used for surface expression of \"empty\" DQ6-LZ or peptide/DQ6-LZ was based on the plasmid ptDR1 constructed previously [33] . A PCR fragment containing the extracellular domain of HLA-DQA1*0102 with a C-terminal Fos motif was cloned into ptDR1 in place of the original expression cassette coding for the DR1 \u03b2 chain via the XmaI and SpeI restriction sites. This created an in-frame fusion of DQA1 to the N terminus of Aga2p (pDQ6\u03b1).

The NetMHCIIpan-4.0 server provides two separate ranking algorithms, EL and BA; the former algorithm is trained mainly on EL mass spectrometry data, and the latter is trained mainly on BA measurement data. EL ranks may consider BA data, although the weighting on BA data is quite small due to the massive amount of EL data generated to date. We compared both computational prediction results with the results of the two empirical methods. Correlations between RIPPA-generated data and prediction data were analyzed by plotting one set against the other on an XY plot, and correlations (R-squared values) and statistical significance (p values) were determined using correlation analysis in GraphPad Prism. A higher correlation (represented by a higher R-squared value) indicates a higher chance of the same peptide ranking higher, e.g., of being an MHC-II ligand, and vice versa, as determined by both datasets.

Flow cytometric data was analyzed using FlowJo.Evaluation of binding kinetics and equilibrium in yeast Like other endpoint approaches, the flow cytometry-based yeast display approach is suboptimal for measuring kinetic parameters. However, if the experiment is designed appropriately (e.g., [pep] \u226b [MHC]), peptide exchange on the surface of yeast cells can be approximated as a pseudo-first-order equimolar reaction, as described previously[24]:[pepMHC] = [pepMHC] eq \u00d7 (1 \u2212 exp (\u2212k obs t)) and [pepMHC] eq = [pep] \u00d7 [pepMHC] max /(K d + [pep]). The observed rate constant (k obs ) and the apparent equilibrium dissociation constant (K d,app ) can be calculated by fitting multiple time point data and equilibrium binding data, respectively. In a 40 \u03bcl reaction containing 6 \u00d7 10 5 galactose-induced yeast cells, the approximate [MHC] = (6 \u00d7 10 5 cells \u00d7 10 5 MHC molecules/cell)/ (6.02 \u00d7 10 23 MHC molecules/mol)/40 \u00b5l = 2.5 nM, given an average of~10 5 copies of recombinant protein Aga2p per yeast cell[29]. The[pep] \u226b [MHC] assumption was confirmed to be valid in the 0.2-100 \u03bcM range of indicator peptides. To calculate k obs , peptide-MHC binding was quantified as the background-subtracted median fluorescence intensity (MFI) of the streptavidin staining signal (i.e., [pepMHC] = MFI SA,indicator \u2212 BG) and was plotted against the incubation time. Data were fitted to the equation [pepMHC] = [pepMH-C] eq \u00d7 (1 \u2212 exp(\u2212k obs t)). To calculate K d,app , incubation was continued for 20 h to allow equilibrium to be attained, and [pepMHC] eq at each peptide concentration was plotted against [pep].
