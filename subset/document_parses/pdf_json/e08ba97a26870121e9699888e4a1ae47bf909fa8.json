            "text": "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) spawned a global health crisis in late 2019 and is caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 infection can lead to elevated markers of endothelial dysfunction associated with higher risk of mortality. It is unclear whether endothelial dysfunction is caused by direct infection of endothelial cells or is mainly secondary to inflammation. Here, we investigate whether different types of endothelial cells are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2. Human endothelial cells from different vascular beds including umbilical vein endothelial cells, coronary artery endothelial cells (HCAEC), cardiac and lung microvascular endothelial cells, or pulmonary arterial cells were inoculated in vitro with SARS-CoV-2. Viral spike protein was only detected in HCAECs after SARS-CoV-2 infection but not in the other endothelial cells tested. Consistently, only HCAEC expressed the SARS-CoV-2 receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), required for virus infection. Infection with the SARS-CoV-2 variants B.1.1.7, B.1.351, and P.2 resulted in significantly higher levels of viral spike protein. Despite this, no intracellular double-stranded viral RNA was detected and the supernatant did not contain infectious virus. Analysis of the cellular distribution of the spike protein revealed that it co-localized with endosomal calnexin. SARS-CoV-2 infection did induce the ER stress gene EDEM1, which is responsible for clearance of misfolded proteins from the ER. Whereas the wild type of SARS-CoV-2 did not induce cytotoxic or pro-inflammatory effects, the variant B.1.1.7 reduced the HCAEC cell number. Of the different tested endothelial cells, HCAECs showed highest viral uptake but did not promote virus replication. Effects on cell number were only observed after infection with the variant B.1.1.7, suggesting that endothelial protection may be particularly important in patients infected with this variant.",

SARS-CoV-2 primarily invades alveolar epithelial cells and causes acute respiratory distress syndrome. However, increasing evidence indicates that endothelial cell dysfunction and vascular events are major complications of the disease. Indeed, vascular inflammation, barrier defects leading to tissue edema, activation of disseminated intravascular coagulation and microthrombi were reported in moderate to severe COVID-19 cases [3, 8, 14, 16, 27, 28, 30] . In addition, pre-existing impaired endothelial function, i.e., in diabetes mellitus patients and underlying vascular pathologies were shown to worsen clinical outcome of COVID-19 [3, 8, 14, 16, 27, 28, 30] . Whether vascular complications can be attributed to a systemic inflammatory response or are a direct consequence of the viral infection of endothelial cells is currently under debate.",

However, the expression of the putative SARS-CoV-2 receptor, i.e., angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is low in endothelial cells compared to mural cells and recent studies suggest that endothelial cells may not be the primary target of SARS-CoV-2 in the vascular wall [11] . This would imply that the endothelium might be affected independently of direct viral action during the course of the disease, whereby the cytokine storm syndrome associated with elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and TNF\u03b1 may cause the loss of antithrombotic and anti-inflammatory functions of endothelial cells [23, 28] .",

Spike protein was only weakly detected in HCAEC and not in any of the other endothelial cells (Fig. 1b-d) , even when extending the duration of infection to 24 h (data not shown). The activity of the viral strain used [5] was evidenced by its ability to infect CaCo2 cells (Fig. 1b, d) . Since we used expanded endothelial cell cultures that might change their gene expression during passaging, the ability of the virus to infect freshly isolated HUVEC was also tested. In line with the results obtained with commercially available HUVEC, no viral spike protein could be detected following incubation with SARS-CoV-2 (Suppl. Fig. 1a-c) . Of note, endogenous degradation pathways might also prevent significant virus accumulation in HCAEC. To test this assumption, we treated HCAEC with the proteasomal inhibitor MG132. MG132 significantly increased spike protein accumulation suggesting that indeed endogenous degradation pathways limit viral protein accumulation (Suppl. Fig. 2 ). Since diabetes mellitus is a risk factor for complicated courses of COVID-19, we additionally infected pulmonary artery endothelial cells from subjects with diabetes (D-HPAEC). However, no spike protein was detected (Fig. 1d, e) . In addition, we investigated whether or not a pro-inflammatory environment could sensitize endothelial cells to SARS-CoV-2 infection. To mimic a proinflammatory environment as it would occur in COVID-19 patients, we pre-incubated endothelial cells with TNF-\u03b1 or interferons for 24 h prior to infection. However, the preexposure of endothelial cells to TNF-\u03b1, IFN\u03b2 or IFN\u03b3 did not change the levels of spike protein in any of the endothelial cells studied (Fig. 1f-h and Suppl. Fig. 2) . Rather, the inflammatory cytokine TNF-\u03b1 reduced spike protein levels in SARS-CoV-2 infected HCAECs (Fig. 1f, g, Suppl. Fig. 3) . Given the discussion, that hydrocortisone may be antiviral [17] and given the fact that the used media contain hydrocortisone, we repeated the SARS-CoV-2 infection experiments in hydrocortisone-depleted media. However, no differences in spike detection were found in the presence and absence of hydrocortisone (data not shown).",

The well-established co-receptor ACE2 was expressed by HCAEC but not by any of the other endothelial cells (Fig. 3a, Suppl. Fig. 1a) . However, unlike CaCo2 cells, where ACE2 proteins was concentrated at the cell membrane, in HCAECs ACE2 was largely present in the perinuclear area with little or no protein detectable at the plasma membrane (Fig. 3a, b) . Expression of the mRNA encoding the protease TMPRSS2, which was shown to act as an activator of SARS-CoV-2 entry, was below detection level in all of the endothelial cells studied (CT-values of water control: 36, TMPRSS2: 37.8 \u00b1 0.7 in endothelial cells compared to 22 \u00b1 0.2 in CaCo2 cells). Other proteases known to be involved in SARS-CoV-2 uptake, such as cathepsin B and cathepsin L, were expressed in the endothelial cells tested (Fig. 3c) . Neuropilin-1 (NRP1) was recently reported to bind to Furin-cleaved substrates and to potentiate SARS-CoV-2 infectivity [7] . NRP1 and FURIN were clearly expressed in heart tissue as determined by single nucleus RNA sequencing (Suppl.

Data are shown as mean and error bars indicate the standard error of the mean (SEM).

Scale bars = 50 \u00b5m \u25c2 cells (Fig. 3c) . CD209L was reported to be a further receptor for SARS-CoV-2 in epithelial and endothelial cells [1] , and surprisingly, was weakly expressed by HLMVEC and D-HPAEC only (Fig. 3c) . Interestingly, bulk RNA sequencing analysis of human aortic endothelial cells, HCMVEC and HUVEC showed elevated levels of ACE2, CTSL and NRP in aortic endothelial cells, which may explain why arterial or coronary endothelial cells might be more prone to SARS-CoV-2 infection (Suppl. Fig. 5 ). To assess the involvement of these proteins in SARS-CoV-2 entry, SARS-CoV-2 infected HCAECs were co-incubated with human recombinant ACE2, FURIN-inhibitor I, chloroquine and the non-selective cathepsin inhibitor ALLM. Interestingly, 3 days post-infection, we found a significant reduction in spike protein staining under all of these conditions (Fig. 3d) .",

Scale bars = 50 \u00b5m heterogeneity and specificity is crucial for the homeostasis of the different organs [2] . In our study, HCAECs show a higher expression of the SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2, which may be responsible for mediating the uptake of the virus. HCMVEC, HLMVEC, HUVEC and HPAEC did not express ACE2 and were not permissive for SARS-CoV-2. However, transducing endothelial cells with recombinant ACE2 may enable SARS-CoV-2 infection as shown recently [20] , suggesting that the lack of sufficient ACE2 expression might be a limiting factor. Subsequent steps in the viral life cycle appear to be blocked in HCAECs. Since we did not detect double-strand viral RNA in HCAECs upon infection, likely early steps in uncoating of the incoming virus, or endosome-virus membrane fusion, or viral RNA synthesis are haltered in HCAECs. It would be of interest to understand the mechanisms that allow this endothelial cell type to block subsequent virus replication [29] . Interestingly, we observed an early induction of EDEM1, which is known to be involved in clearance of misfolded proteins in the ER [18] . One may speculate that the induction of this gene may be involved in the removal of spike protein limiting further viral activities.",

However, these studies were performed with stem cell-derived endothelial cells, which may not fully resemble primary cultured lung or cardiac endothelial cells, as used in our study. In addition, one report found no evidence of direct viral infection of vascular endothelial cells in an ex vivo lung culture of one COVID-19 patient [13] , which was supported by others [24] and by our own ex vivo heart slice model, where we could not detect spike positive endothelial cells. To our knowledge, this is currently the first study to compare the effect of SARS-CoV-2 variants on endothelial cells. We demonstrate a higher uptake of the three tested virus variants in HCAECs, however, B.1.1.7 was the only variant that affected cell number.",

            "text": "One limitation of the present study and previous reports is that we cannot exclude that endothelial cells in humans might react differently and that the in vitro culture and expansion of endothelial cells change their gene expression and responses. We also tested whether a pro-inflammatory environment would have facilitated virus infection. However, stimulation of endothelial cells with pro-inflammatory cytokines or using endothelial cells cultured from diabetic patients did not augment the SARS-CoV-2 infection in the present in vitro study. Recent findings suggested that inflammatory cytokines contribute to a complicated course of COVID-19 [15] . Therefore, we speculate that pre-treatment of endothelial cells with pro-inflammatory cytokines might sensitize endothelial cells for viral infection. However, we did observe reduced levels of viral spike protein upon TNF\u03b1 stimulation, whereas IFN\u03b2 and IFN\u03b3 had no influence. It is unclear why TNF\u03b1 did reduce viral spike protein load in endothelial cells and limited information is available regarding the effects of TNF\u03b1 on SARS-CoV-2 virus entry and infection rate. One study reports a link between TNF\u03b1 and ACE2 expression, which was reduced by systemic anti-TNF\u03b1 treatment in intestinal cells [26] . However, we did not find a transcriptional regulation of ACE2 in endothelial cells (Suppl. Fig. 6 ). Thus, one may speculate that TNF\u03b1 might interfere with other mechanisms resulting in a reduction of viral uptake or destabilization of spike protein.",

However, due to reduction of cell number observed after infection of HCAECs with the variant B.1.1.7, patients infected with these SARS-Co-V-2 variants should be closely monitored. Overall, therapeutic interventions aiming at endothelial protection may be warranted to protect against primary or secondary effects to maintain organ integrity during later development of the disease.",

However, HCAEC appear to take up the virus and show positive spike protein in the endosomal compartment. Since no permissive infection was detected in endothelial cells, SARS-CoV-2 might indirectly induce endothelial cell dysfunction via the systemic inflammatory response that causes the observed striking vascular effects in patients with COVID-19. Interestingly, of all the endothelial cells studied only HCAECs were positive for spike protein after SARS-CoV-2 infection, suggesting different responses of endothelial cells derived from different vascular beds.
