To achieve this goal, in this paper, we propose an ensemble of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based on EfficientNet, named ECOVNet, to detect COVID-19 from chest X-rays. To make the proposed model more robust, we have used one of the largest open-access chest X-ray data sets named COVIDx containing three classes-COVID-19, normal, and pneumonia. For feature extraction, we have applied an effective CNN structure, namely EfficientNet, with ImageNet pre-training weights. The generated features are transferred into custom fine-tuned top layers followed by a set of model snapshots. The predictions of the model snapshots (which are created during a single training) are consolidated through two ensemble strategies, i.e., hard ensemble and soft ensemble, to enhance classification performance. In addition, a visualization technique is incorporated to highlight areas that distinguish classes, thereby enhancing the understanding of primal components related to COVID-19. The results of our empirical evaluations show that the proposed ECOVNet model outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches and significantly improves detection performance with 100% recall for COVID-19 and overall accuracy of 96.07%. We believe that ECOVNet can enhance the detection of COVID-19 disease, and thus, underpin a fully automated and efficacious COVID-19 detection system.",

The disease was first detected in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China in December 2019, and was related to contact with a seafood wholesale market and quickly spread to all parts of the world (World Health Organization, 2020). The World Health Organization (WHO) promulgated the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic on 11 March 2020. This perilous virus has not only overwhelmed the world, but also affected millions of lives (World Health Organization, 2020) . To limit the spread of this infection, all infected countries strive to cover many strategies such as encourage people to maintain social distancing as well as lead hygienic life, enhance the infection screening system through multi-functional testing, seek mass vaccination to reduce the pandemic ahead of time, etc. The reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is a modular diagnosis method, however, it has limitations, such as strict procedures at testing laboratories cause delays to the detection of suspect patients (Zheng et al., 2020) and false-negative results may have a greater impact on the prevention and control of the disease (Fang et al., 2020) .",

The WHO and Wuhan University Zhongnan Hospital issued quick guides (World Health Organization, 2020; Jin et al., 2020a) , suggesting that in addition to detecting clinical symptoms, chest imaging can also be used to evaluate the disease to diagnose and treat COVID-19. In Rubin et al. (2020) , the authors have contributed a detailed guideline for medical practitioners to use chest radiography and computed tomography (CT) to screen and assess the disease progression of COVID-19 cases. Although CT scans have higher sensitivity, they also have some drawbacks, such as a high cost and the need for high doses of radiation during screening, which exposes pregnant women and children to greater radiation risks (Davies, Wathen & Gleeson, 2011) . On the other hand, diagnosis based on chest X-ray appears to be a propitious solution for COVID-19 detection and treatment. Ng et al. (2020) reported that the pulmonary manifestation of COVID-19 infection was immensely delineated by chest X-ray images.",

In this context, we contemplate a CNN-based architecture, since it is renowned for its excellent recognition performance in image classification and detection. For medical image analysis, higher detection accuracy along with crucial findings is a top aspiration, and in current years, CNN based architectures are comprehensively featured the critical findings related to medical imaging. To achieve the defined purpose, this paper presents a novel CNN-based architecture called ECOVNet, exploiting the cutting-edge EfficientNet family of CNN models together with ensemble strategies. The pipeline of the proposed architecture starts with the data augmentation approach, then optimizes and fine-tunes the pre-trained EfficientNet models, creating respective model's snapshots. After that, generated model snapshots are integrated into an ensemble, i.e., soft ensemble and hard ensemble, to make predictions. The motivation for using EfficientNet models is that they are known for their high accuracy, while being smaller and faster than the best existing CNN architectures. Moreover, an ensemble technique has been effective in predicting since it produces a lower error rate compared with the prediction of a single model. The use of ensemble techniques on different CNN models has proven to be an effective technique for image-based diagnosis and biomedical research (Kumar et al., 2017) . Owing to the limited number of COVID-19 images currently available, diagnosing COVID-19 infection is more challenging, therefore refining a visual explainable approach is applied for further analysis. In this regard, we use a gradient-based class activation mapping algorithm, i.e., Grad-CAM (Selvaraju et al., 2017) , providing explanations of the predictions and identifying relevant features associated with COVID-19 infection. The key contributions of this paper are as follows:",

            "text": "Significant improvements achieved through CNN technology have prompted computational medical imaging researchers to study the potential of CNN in medical images obtained through CT, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and X-rays. Many researchers have explored CNN technology as an effective way to classify (Kaur & Gandhi, 2020) and segment (Zhang et al., 2015 ) MR brain images, and have obtained the best performance. What's more, pneumonia detection using chest X-rays with CNN is a state-of-the-art technology which highlights the potential of image diagnosis systems (Rajpurkar et al., 2017) . The need to identify COVID-19 infections faster, the latest application areas of CNN-based AI systems are booming, which will potentially speed up the analysis of various medical images. An in-depth survey of the application of CNN technology in COVID-19 detection and automatic lung segmentation using X-rays and CT images is presented in Shoeibi et al. (2020) . Due to the need to interpret chest CT images faster, Jin et al. (2020b) proposed an AI system based on deep learning that can speed up the analysis of chest CTs to detect COVID-19 and validated using a large multi-class dataset. A new CNN architecture named COVID-Net and a large chest X-ray benchmark dataset (COVIDx) have introduced in Wang, Lin & Wong (2020) . The proposed COVID-Net obtained the best test accuracy of 93.3%, and uses an interpretability method to make predictions. Luz et al. (2020) proposed a new deep learning framework that extends the EfficientNet ) series, which is well known for its excellent prediction performance and fewer computational steps. Their experimental evaluation showed noteworthy classification performance, especially in COVID-19 cases. A CNN model called DarkCovidNet (Ozturk et al., 2020) was proposed for the automatic detection of COVID-19 using chest X-ray images where the proposed method carried out two types of classification, one for binary classification (such as and the other for multi-class classification (such as . Finally, the authors provided an intuitive explanation through a heat map, so it can assist radiologists to find the affected area on the chest X-ray. Another study (Karim et al., 2020) proposed an explainable CNN-based method named DeepCOVIDExplainer to automatically detect COVID-19 cases from chest X-ray images. The method involved adjusting a neural ensemble technique then highlighting class-discriminating regions. Khan, Shah & Bhat (2020) proposed a model named CoroNet that used Xception architecture pre-trained on an ImageNet dataset and trained on their benchmark created from two publicly available datasets, and carried out two different classification performance measurements, i.e., three and four classes with classification accuracy of 95% and 89.6%, respectively. In another work, Mahmud, Rahman & Fattah (2020) proposed a CNN-based model called CovXNet, which uses depth-wise dilated convolution. At first, the model was trained with some non-COVID-19 pneumonia images; the acquired learning was used with some additional fine-tuning layers that trained again with a smaller number of chest X-rays related to COVID-19 and other pneumonia cases. As features are extracted from different resolutions of X-rays, a stacking algorithm is used in the prediction process for multi-classclassification, the accuracy of CovXNet is 90.3%. An advanced custom CNN architecture, COVID-Net (Wang, Lin & Wong, 2020 ) was implemented and tested using a large COVID-19 benchmark, but due to the large number of parameters, the computational overhead of this model is high. Another CNN-based modular architecture, named PDCOVIDNet, is proposed by Chowdhury, Rahman & Kabir (2020) , which consists of a parallel stack of multi-layer filter blocks in a cascade with a classification and visualization block. The authors reported the model was effective when compared with a number of well-known CNN architectures and showed precision and recall of 96.58% and 96.59%, respectively. Table 1 shows an overview of some CNN-based architectures for detecting COVID-19 from chest X-rays.",

(2020) , authors used an ensemble on heterogeneous models, i.e., VGG19 (Simonyan & Zisserman, 2015) , ResNet18 (He et al., 2016) , and DenseNet161 (Huang et al., 2017b) , but it has two flaws. Firstly, each model requires a separate training session, and secondly, an individual model suffers from training many parameters. In another method (Mahmud, Rahman & Fattah, 2020) used an ensemble on a single model with various image resolutions, and for each image resolution, it creates a separate model and stacks it for prediction, which incurs a significant computational overhead. To address the aforementioned problems, we use a lightweight but effective model EfficientNet-it is 8.4 times smaller and 6.1 times faster than the best existing CNN . Also, we force large changes in model weights through the recursive learning rate, create model snapshots in the same training, and further apply the ensemble to make the proposed architecture more robust, thereby achieving a higher detection rate compared to other methods.",

By adopting a compound scaling method in all dimensions of the network, i.e., width, depth, and resolution, EfficientNets have attracted attention due to their superior prediction performance. The intuition of using compound scaling is that scaling any dimension of the network (such as width, depth, or image resolution) can increase accuracy, but for larger models, the accuracy gain will decrease. To scale the dimensions of the network systematically, compound scaling uses a compound coefficient that controls how many more resources are functional for model scaling, and the dimensions are scaled by the compound coefficient in the following way (Tan & Le, 2019):",

Instead of random initialization of network weights, we instantiate ImageNet's pre-trained weights in the EfficientNet model thereby accelerating the training process. ImageNet has performed a great feat in the field of image analysis, since it is composed of more than 14 million images covering eclectic classes. The rationale for using pre-trained weights is that the imported model already has sufficient knowledge in the broader aspects of the image domain. As shown in several studies (Rajaraman et al., 2020; Narin, Ceren & Ziynet, 2020) , there is reason for optimism in using pre-trained ImageNet weights in state-of-the-art CNN models even when the problem area (namely COVID-19 detection) is considerably distinct from the one in which the original weights were obtained. The optimization process will fine-tune the initial pre-training weights in the new training phase so that we can fit the pre-trained model to a specific problem domain, such as COVID-19 detection. For the feature extraction process of the proposed ECOVNet architecture applying pre-trained ImageNet weights is executed after the image augmentation process, as presented in Fig. 1 .",

Swish has many characteristics, such as one-sided boundedness at zero, smoothness, and non-monotonicity, which play an important role in improving it (Ramachandran, Zoph & Le, 2017) . After performing the activation operation, we integrated a dropout (Srivastava et al., 2014) layer, which is one of the preeminent regularization methods to reduce overfitting and make better predictions. This layer can randomly drop certain FC layer nodes, which means removing all randomly selected nodes, along with all its incoming and outgoing weights. The number of randomly selected nodes drop in each layer is obtained with a probability p independent of other layers, where p can be chosen by using either a validation set or a random estimate (i.e., p = 0.5).",

One of the main methods for creating model snapshots for CNN is to collect multiple models during a single training run with cyclic cosine annealing (Huang et al., 2017a) .

The following learning rate cycle uses these weights, but allows the learning algorithm to converge to different solutions, thereby generating diverse snapshots model. After completing M cycles of training, we get M model snapshots s 1 . . .s M , each of which will be utilized in the ensemble prediction. An ensemble through model snapshots is more effective than a structure based on a single model only. Therefore, compared with the prediction of a single model, the ensemble prediction reduces the generalization error, thereby improving the prediction performance. We have experimented with two ensemble strategies, i.e., hard ensemble and soft ensemble, to consolidate the predictions of snapshots model to classify chest X-ray images as COVID-19 or normal or pneumonia. Both hard ensemble and soft ensemble use the last m (m \u2264 M) model's softmax outputs since these models have a tendency to have the lowest test error.

In order to solve the problem of overfitting, we use L1L2 weight decay regularization with coefficients 1e\u22125 and 1e\u22123 in FC layers. Next, dropout is another successful regularization technique that has been integrated into the proposed architecture, especially in FC layers with p = 0.3, to suppress overfitting. In the experiments on the proposed architecture, we have explored the Adam optimizer (Kingma & Ba, 2014) , which can converge faster. When creating snapshots, we set the number of epochs to 25, the minimum batch size to 8, the initial learning rate to 1e\u22124, and the number of cycles to 5, thus providing 5 snapshots for each model, on which we build up the ensemble prediction.",

Due to its black-box nature, it is sometimes contrary to apply it in a medical diagnosis system where we need an interpretable system, i.e., visualization as well as an accurate diagnosis. Although it has certain challenges, researchers are still trying to develop an efficient visualization technique. Such a technique would benefit the health-care system by assisting medical practitioners to distinguish correlations and patterns in imaging, and allowing them to perform more efficacious data analysis. In the field of detecting COVID-19 through chest X-rays, some early studies focused on visualizing the behavior of CNN models to distinguish between different categories (such as COVID-19, normal, and pneumonia), so they can produce explanatory models. In our proposed model, we applied a gradient-based approach named Grad-CAM (Selvaraju et al., 2017) , which measures the gradients of features maps in the final convolution layer on a CNN model for a target image, to foreground the critical regions that are class-discriminating saliency maps. In Grad-CAM, gradients that are flowing back to the final convolutional layer in a CNN model are globally averaged to calculate the target class weights of each filter. A Grad-CAM heat-map is a combination of weighted feature maps, followed by a ReLU activation. The class-discriminative saliency map L c for the target image class c is defined as follows (Selvaraju et al., 2017) :",

Without augmentation, under the condition of without ensemble, ECOVNet's accuracy reaches 96.26%, and its performance is lower for with augmentation, reaching 94.68% accuracy. We calculated accuracy with 95% CI. A tight range of CI means higher precision, while the wide range of CI indicates the opposite. As we can see, the CI interval is in a narrow range for the case of no augmentation, and the CI range is wider for the case of augmentation. Furthermore, Fig. 3 shows the training loss of ECOVNet considering EfficientNet-B5. We implement two ensemble strategies: hard ensemble and soft ensemble. Each ensemble has a total of 5 model snapshots that are generated during a single training. Tables 6 and 7 show the classification results using ensembles without augmentation and with augmentation, respectively. As shown in Table 6 , in handling COVID-19 cases, the ensemble methods are significantly better than the no ensemble method. More specifically, the recall hits its maximum value of 100%, and to a large extent, this result demonstrates the robustness of our proposed architecture. Furthermore, for COVID-19 detection, soft ensemble seems to be the preferred method due to its recall and F1-score of 100% and 96.15%, respectively. In the soft ensemble, the average softmax score of each category affects the direction of the desired result, thus the performance of the soft ensemble is better than the hard ensemble.

When comparing the two ensemble methods, we see that hard ensemble outperforms soft ensemble with a significant margin in the case of precision and F1-score, but an exception is that the soft ensemble is slightly better than the hard ensemble when recall is taken into account. Moreover, in the case of overall accuracy, the hard ensemble shows better detection performance than the soft ensemble. It can also be clearly seen from Tables 6 and 7 that for COVID-19 cases, the precision of the hard ensemble method is better than the soft ensemble method in terms of augmentation and no augmentation. Finally, we also observe that the confidence interval range is small for a no augmentation strategy (Table 6 ) compared to an augmentation strategy (Table 7) . In Fig. 4 , the proposed ECOVNet (base models B0-B5) is aimed at the precision, recall, and F1-score of the soft ensemble of test data considering the COVID-19 cases. When comparing the precision of ECOVNet, we have seen that ECOVNet-B4 (base model B4) shows significantly better performance than the other base models. However, in terms of recall, as we consider more in-depth base models, the value gradually increases. The same is true for F1-scores as well except with a slight decrease of 0.5% from ECOVNet-B5 to ECOVNet-B4. It is often useful to analyze the ROC curve in considering the classification performance of the model since the ROC curve summarizes the trade-off between the true positive rate and the false positive rate of a model that taking into account different probability thresholds. In Fig. 5 , the ROC curves show the micro and macro average and class-wise AUC scores obtained by the proposed ECOVNet, where each curve refers to the ROC curve of an individual model snapshot. The AUC scores of all categories are consistent, indicating that the prediction of the proposed model is stable. However, the AUC scores in the third and fourth snapshots are better than other snapshots. As it is evident from Fig. 5 that the area under the curve of all classes is relatively similar, but COVID-19's AUC is higher than other classes, i.e., 1. Furthermore, Fig. 6 shows the confusion matrices of the proposed ECOVNet model considering the base model of EfiicientNet-B5. In Fig. 6 , it is clear that for COVID-19, the ensemble methods provide better results than those without ensemble methods. These methods provide results that are 3-4% better than without ensemble. However, ECOVNet can detect normal and pneumonia chest X-rays, whether in ensemble or no ensemble, it can provide the same performance. When comparing normal and pneumonia cases, the proposed ECOVNet model provides excellent results for detecting normal cases. Finally, we can say that ECOVNet is an eminent architecture for detecting COVID-19 cases from chest X-ray images, because it focuses on distinguishing features that help distinguish COVID-19 from normal and pneumonia.

Table 8 shows the comparison between our proposed ECOVNet method and the state-of-the-art methods for detecting COVID-19 from chest X-rays. We compare our proposed method with COVID-Net (https://github.com/lindawangg/COVID-Net), EfficientNet-B3 (https://github.com/ufopcsilab/EfficientNet-C19), DarkCovidNet (https://github.com/muhammedtalo/COVID-19) and CoroNet (https://github.com/ drkhan107/CoroNet). All these methods have released either the trained model (such as COVID-Net), on our used train dataset or the source code. We compare the precision, recall and accuracy of our proposed method with the existing methods using the same training and test dataset (see Table 3 ) derived from COVIDx note1 While comparing with COVID-Net (Wang, Lin & Wong, 2020) , we observe that the recall of our proposed method is 6% higher than for COVID-Net. Another method called EfficientNet-B3 (Luz et al., 2020) shows higher precision than ours, but its recall and accuracy lag. A method called DarkCovidNet (Ozturk et al., 2020 ) achieves a precision of 96.00%, which is higher than our precision. The proposed ECOVNet is superior to DarkCovidNet in recall and accuracy. The precision, recall and accuracy of CoroNet (Khan, Shah & Bhat, 2020) are significantly lower than for our model. As we have observed from the empirical evaluation of the test dataset, the proposed method shows the same classification accuracy in different combinations of soft and hard ensembles. When comparing the results of the soft and hard ensemble, we observed that the soft ensemble showed impressive results when classifying COVID-19 with 100% recall. We have also conducted experiments on EfficientNet, which mainly consists of feature extraction, a global average pool of generated features, and a classification layer. On the other hand, the proposed ECOVNet has considered the use of transfer learning in combination with fine-tuning steps and ensemble methods, so significant improvements can be achieved. In Table 9 , it can be seen that our proposed method shows better results than the EfficientNet model.",

            "text": "We applied the Grad-CAM visual interpretation method to visually depict the salient areas where ECOVNet emphasizes the classification decision for a given chest X-ray image. Accurate and definitive salient region detection is crucial for the analysis of classification decisions as well as for assuring the trustworthiness of the results. In order to locate the salient area, the feature weights with various illuminations related to feature importance are used to create a two-dimensional heat map and superimpose it on a given input image. Figure 7 shows the visualization results of locating Grad-CAM using ECOVNet for each model snapshots. This salient area locates the area of each category area in the lung that has been identified when a given image is classified as COVID-19 or normal or pneumonia. As shown in Fig. 7 , for COVID-19, a ground-glass opacity (GGO) occurs along with some consolidation, thereby partially covering the markings of the lungs. Hence, it leads to lung inflammation in both the upper and lower zones of the lung. When examining the heat maps generated from the COVID-19 chest X-ray, it can be distinguished that the heat maps created from snapshot 2 and snapshot 3 points to the salient area (such as GGO). However, in the case of the normal chest X-ray, no lung inflammation is observed, so there is no significant area, thereby it is easily distinguishable from COVID-19 and pneumonia. As well, it can be observed from the chest X-ray for pneumonia that there are GGOs in the middle and lower parts of the lungs. The heat maps generated for the pneumonia chest X-ray are localized in the salient regions with GGO, but for the 4th snapshot model, it appears to fail to identify the salient regions as the heat map highlights outside the lung. Accordingly, we believe that the proposed ECOVNet provides sufficient information about the inherent causes of the COVID-19 disease through an intuitive heat map, and this type of heat map can help AI-based systems interpret the classification results.",

In this work, a highly effective CNN structure (such as the EfficientNet base model with ImageNet pre-trained weights) is used for feature extraction, while fine-tuned pre-trained weights are considered for related COVID-19 detection tasks. Also, ensemble predictions improve the performance by exploiting the predictions obtained from the proposed ECOVNet model snapshots. The results of our empirical evaluations show that the soft ensemble of the proposed ECOVNet model snapshots outperforms the other state-of-the-art methods. Finally, we performed a visualization study to locate significant areas in the chest X-ray through the class activation map for classifying the chest X-ray into its expected category. Thus, we believe that our findings could make a useful contribution to the detection of COVID-19 infection and the widespread acceptance of automated applications in medical practice. While this work contributes to reduce the effort of health professional's radiological assessment, our future plan is to lead this work to design a fully-functional application using guidelines of the design research paradigm (Miah & Gammack, 2014; Miah, 2008) . Such a modern methodological lens could offer further directions both for developing innovative clinical solutions and associative knowledge in the body of relevant literature.",
