One of the most notable developments has been the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) self-test kits containing a swab, a test stripe and a small amount of liquid. These have been manufactured, posted, collected and the results analyzed, within a matter of days. The most important part of the kit is the small vial, containing the liquid. From the COVID-19 predicament and from a production perspective, what is apparent is the importance of identifying the least amount of liquid that can \"do the job\". This is important because even a small increment of liquid volume per vial, i.e., an increment of even 1 mL, would be considerable given mass production and, therefore, the volume of liquid needed for adequate detection. This recent example, therefore, demonstrates the importance of utilizing techniques that can reduce chemical waste, which would have a direct impact on the economic and environmental aspects of these chemicals, i.e., slightly more volume would require a larger container, which would mean more plastic material to be used for the container, etc.",

The question then would be identifying the optimal amount of liquid required for a target purpose, in the interest of reducing waste and limitations in the availability, i.e., blood/urine sample. In this case, the detection mechanism would have a direct impact on the volume of liquid/chemical needed for successful, and ideal fast-paced, diagnosis. The time factor is, therefore, as important as the other factors considered here. For example, the quality of many biomedical liquids decreases with time [1] [2] [3] , which changes their surface chemistry properties. Therefore, effective measurement of physical-chemical properties of a liquid utilizing the least amount of liquid and a fast-paced technique, is in considerable demand in the modern era.",

This method is based on measuring the contact angle of a liquid with respect to a solid when the surface tension of the liquid is known. The contact angle will show good or bad wetting properties of liquids if it is less than 90 \u2022 or higher than 90 \u2022 , respectively [20] . The plate used in this method is made out of platinum which is usually roughened to increase its surface wettability. In addition, the plate is also pre-wetted in the liquid under analysis to have a zero-contact angle. However, this technique is relatively more expensive, and the wastage of chemicals is quite high, i.e., typically 40 mL used for each analysis. In addition, because of the high surface energy of the platinum plate used in the Wilhelmy method, this method cannot be used to measure the interfacial surface tension of liquids, often found in biomedical applications [10] . In addition, the Wilhelmy plate method is limited when the viscous relaxation is too long, which affects the contact angle measurement of liquids [21] .",

The CMH represents the maximum height that the liquid meniscus reaches before collapsing, when pinned at the edge of the solid (e.g., optical fiber), extracted from the liquid. The use of fiber instead of a plate gives considerable advantages. For example, steady-state measurements are possible with high viscosity liquids, which is a challenge at present [23] . The meniscus height rapidly settles at equilibrium on small diameter and stationary fiber, resulting in high accuracy of results [24] . This had been achieved due to the considerably small cross sectional-area exposure demanded by optical fiber, i.e., 125 \u00b5m diameter. Other advantages of using optical fiber for the purpose are its durability and electrical passivity, both of which are significant aspects considered in medical/chemical equipment. However, the utilization of optical fiber still remains quite expensive due to the expense of typical laser interrogator units [25] [26] [27] . In addition, the standard wavelength used by the interrogator (1550 nm) [28] [29] [30] is absorbed by some liquids, such as water. This increases the liquid temperature. This, in turn, affects the surface chemistry properties of water, i.e., surface tension and contact angle, which change with temperature [31] [32] [33] [34] . Therefore, a suitable interrogator which targets the required detection wavelength range must be carefully chosen or implemented.",

At higher speeds, the contact angle will depend on the viscosity of the liquid [36] . Therefore, when evaluating the rate of submergence and extraction on the surface chemistry properties, the detection system should have a sufficient rate for data Sensors 2021, 21, 8130 3 of 12 extraction in order to minimize the loss of data at crucial points. Faster data extraction also becomes crucial with particular bio-liquids that expire within a short time.",

This new setup involves a relatively less expensive light source (LED halogen source) compared to the laser interrogator unit. In addition, the new setup uses a faster and cheaper recording rate device, such an Arduino (~130 Hz), which increases the data recording by more than 60 times compared to the laser interrogator (2 Hz). Moreover, the new setup uses a less expensive wavelength filter, by implementing a fiber coupler centered at the wavelength that is not absorbed by the liquids under analysis. Therefore, with the new interrogation setup, the CMH of liquid can be analyzed at a wavelength that is not absorbed by the liquid, in a shorter amount of time, and using a cheaper and easy to implement setup. In addition, using the proposed scheme, the CMH is evaluated to measure surface tension and dynamic viscosity of different liquids at room temperature.",

A beaker containing the solution is moved up and downwards using a tensile machine (Lloyd Instruments QA LRX 05). When the cleaved optical fiber is connected to the laser interrogator (Micron Optics sm125), the reflected optical power output can be read by a computer connected to it. Moreover, a different reflected optical power is recorded when the fiber is in the air or in contact with the liquid. Before the measurement starts, the liquid is placed close to the fiber-end (e.g., 1 mm) and then moved at a constant speed until the fiber registers the reflected optical power variation due to the liquid. Thus, once the fiber is in the liquid, the optical power varies and the submergence is made to stop [22] . When the 125 \u00b5m diameter optical fiber is in the process of being extracted from the specific liquid sample, it reaches a maximum (maxima of Harkins [37] ), which occurs when the meniscus volume reaches its maximum value by pinning at the edge [38] of the cleaved optical fiber. Furthermore, the meniscus decreases its volume and eventually breaks. As mentioned before, the maximum height just before the breakage of the meniscus represents the CMH. When that occurs, an optical power variation is observed due to the different refractive index of the liquid compared to air. Also, the liquid surface returns to its undisturbed state, i.e., flat surface, and the optical fiber registers a reflected amplitude interference since a Fabry-Perot cavity is formed between the fiber end and the flat liquid surface.",

Also, since the optical fiber radius (R) is of 62.5 \u00b5m, the Bond number (\u03b2 2 = \u03c1gR 2 /\u03b3) is smaller than 0.1 (where g is the acceleration due to gravity, \u03c1 is the density of the liquid, and \u03b3 is the surface tension of the liquid), the density values of liquids would not affect the CMH measurement.

Table 2 presents six liquids, which can be grouped into three groups with two liquids each (Acetone-IPA, Benzene-P3 Oil, Paraffin-Engine Oil). The liquids in each group present the same density and surface tension but different values of dynamic viscosity. Thus, the CMH variation is seen between the lowest and the highest liquid dynamic viscosity within their group. In addition, the speed of extraction varies from 5 to 100 mm/min, so that the variation of the CMH is also seen in the transaction between the static and dynamic regions. As seen in Table 2 , some negligible differences in density values still exist due to the challenge of finding readily available liquids with the same properties. As mentioned in the previous section, the small fiber radius makes the Bond number negligible, as shown in Table 2 . Therefore, the density variations between two liquids of the same group would not affect the CMH measurement. However, the importance of dynamic viscosity (\u00b5) over the surface tension forces of the liquid is better represented by the Ohnesorge number (Oh = \u00b5/(\u03c1\u03b3R)), which is typically used to measure the influence of the viscosity forces over the inertial and surface tension forces.

From 2 to 2.3 s, the optical fiber is closer to the surface of the liquid, and the voltage increases due to an increase of reflected light coming from the leveled liquid surface. Then the voltage decreases, indicating that the optical fiber is in contact with the liquid. At this stage, the tensile machine arm is stopped. This point is considered to be the starting point to start measuring the CMH. In this case, a time of 4 s (from 2.3 to~6.3 s) is allowed for the fiber to register an optical power variation. The fiber is then extracted from the liquid at a constant speed until the meniscus breaks. During this time, the measured voltage will continue to decrease, and once the meniscus breaks, the voltage will increase. The time duration from the start of the motion of the optical fiber to the time of registering an increase in the voltage, is recorded. This time is then translated to length (e.g., CMH) using the speed of motion. Therefore, the voltage-time curve in Figure 7 will change this time difference for each liquid, since they present different CMH values. However, the signal continues to increase until a plateau is reached at a time of~8.7 s. In addition, a voltage difference is present between the voltage registered at the start of the measurement and that measured at the end. This is due to residual liquid present at the end of the fiber. For this reason, the optical fiber was cleaned with a detergent, acetone, and then with water and before being dried in air until the signal was restored to one of the cleaved fibers in the air. ",

Liquids like glycerol, ethylene glycol, and IPA presented an increased CMH variation of~5,~5,~2 \u00b5m, respectively, compared to the results obtained previously with the interrogator. It is suspected that the difference is due to the presence of the OH \u2212 groups present within the chemical structure. In addition, the correction to the evaporation rate of the liquids has decreased as the power intensity and different wavelengths were selected. Considering those values of CMH in the graph shown in Figure 2 , the slope of the CMH is 0.77 \u00b1 0.05 \u00b5m/(mN/m) with an r 2 of 0.977. Thus, an increase of the slope and r 2 is present in this scenario, demonstrating an improvement in the measuring method. In addition, the expense of the instrumentation has also been decreased.",

As mentioned before, liquids in Table 2 present the same surface tension and density as for the three groups of liquids, such as acetone and IPA, benzene and P3 oil, engine and paraffin oil. However, they present different dynamic viscosity values at room temperature. Figure 8 shows the normalized difference between the three groups of liquids, as mentioned in the method Section 2.3. The graph shows that the increase of the Oh number increases the difference in terms of the critical meniscus height as the speed of the fiber increases. This trend is comparable to the data shown in [39] . However, there is less variation of the CMH between the three groups at a lower speed than higher speed. In addition, as soon as the speed increases over the threshold between static and dynamic, the variation in CMH between the three groups increases as the speed increases.",

In addition, this method was compared to the results obtained by the laser interrogator unit from a previous study [22] . The result showed a variation in CMH values for some liquids, and this could be attributed to their high absorbance in particular wavelength ranges due to the highpower-laser light source, as opposed to variations in the measurand. In addition, a fiber coupler was used as a filter, so that only the target wavelengths, i.e., wavelengths that are not absorbed by the liquids, were injected in the liquid. Thus, the liquids did not absorb the wavelength, which means the results were not influenced by temperature fluctuations induced by wavelength absorption. Furthermore, the speed of removing the fiber from the liquid provided a variation of the CMH. This value was approximately the same for low speeds, whereas it increased as the speed went beyond 20 mm/min. The proposed system showcases a time-and cost-effective solution for the measurement of physical-chemical properties in liquids, compared to state-of-the-art methods. ",
