Its code of ethics is internationally considered as a basic reference [15] . However, it is still focused almost exclusively on the detrimental effects of work and not on its positive effects such as well-being at work, quality of working life, or salutogenesis. Out of its 37 Scientific Committees, none are mainly dedicated to these beneficial aspects of work; they all look at potential negative impacts of work on workers' health and not on the positive aspects of work and on well-being. This fact illustrates that the traditional objectives of OSH (prevention of accidents and diseases) remain predominant in this important community. However, other organizations, such as the WHO or the European Union [16] , have launched in the early new century the concept of \"Workplace Health Promotion\" that stresses the importance of work organization, active participation of all actors, and the need for personal development, which is complementary to the OSH field and leads to a global approach of the work environment. This is illustrated by several international programs such as the \"Healthy Workplace\" model from the WHO [17] , the Total Workers Health\u2122 from the NIOSH in the USA [18] , and the \"Vision Zero\" from the ISSA [19] .",

Since each job has its specific threats to health, the task of OSH professionals to prevent any harm is becoming more and more complex; \u2022 Uberization allows, through a digital platform, to connect directly to providers of a service to customers without middle persons. This very convenient practice for the customers creates problems for the service providers who are often considered as self-employed workers without any social protection from the owner of the platform who takes a commission on each service and does not usually assume the costs of the social protection of the service providers [24] . Such a situation may initiate psychic stress among the concerned people. \u2022 Teleworking (home working-remote working) has exploded during the COVID-19 pandemic and has had positive and negative impacts. Among the positive aspects, flexibility and tailored work organization is prevailing followed by the suppression of commuting that spares time and protect the environment. The negative aspects mainly concern the lack of direct social interactions, the difficulties in organizing professional and private life, and the risk of burnout (too much commitment) and depression. It appears that this major change will remain after the pandemic at a lower scale, but higher than before. This creates a blurred boundary between professional and private activities that may impact the work-life balance, leading to increased PSRs [25] ; \u2022 Invisible jobs are those that are not well-considered, are underpaid, despised, classbiased, etc., such as road crews, garbage collectors, housekeepers, and many others. Unpaid jobs are also invisible, such as domestic tasks; voluntary work for associations, communities, non-governmental organizations; lending assistance to needy people; etc. These jobs must be better recognized as being just as important as the other ones and cannot be ignored in a global OSH approach [26] .",

However, when the changes of governance are not based on these ethical principles but only on economic performance, negative and problematic issue emerges. Such companies argue that the new model of governance will also be beneficial for the employees, but they do not take care of their health and well-being and introduce pressure for more intensive and productive work, leading to burnout, depression, distrust, etc. [40] In this context, the explosion of labels, certifications, standards, agreements, etc. illustrates what can be either a real motivation of companies, a search for an improved image or the following of a new fashion.

Well described by Laloux [36] , this company has gained international renown and has become a model thanks to its performance and its governance strategy. It employs 15,000 nurses and 950 teams that are autonomous and work much more efficiently than the traditional companies. It is one of the best examples of the shift from an Orange model to a Teal one. In the past, an imposed model led to the fact that the nurses' tasks were specialized, standardized, timed, and controlled, which fits perfectly with the Orange system. However, the overall outcome has proved distressing both to patients and nurses. Patients lost their personal relationship with the nurses and the nurses suffered for working conditions they found degrading, especially due to the electronic registration device to control their activities. These practices were antagonist to their vocation to care for those in need. Even in the headquarter of such an organization, people did not find their work meaningful.",

This revolutionary evolution implied the mobilization of the collective intelligence, the development of new strategies, the employees' training and education on new jobs and skills, as well as agility, so that everybody could feel concerned, responsible, and committed to cope with this huge challenge. Moreover, the emergence and flow of new ideas, and contact and collaboration with clients had to be improved; this was not possible with the traditional pyramidal model of management in place. Engie announced in 2019 the organization of its businesses around business lines and business units. The business unit \"Global Energy Management\" (5000 employees) explored the new concepts of management and work organization and inevitably arrived to holacracy (holacracy is a method of decentralized management and organizational governance, where authority and decision-making is distributed between self-organizing teams). The first feedbacks were very positive, and the company hired experts to internally develop an adequate model, which proved to be successful for innovation and employees' well-being.

Barriers to unfair behavior are the transparency of the company's financial information, peer pressure to keep budgets in line, the company's culture and values, and inspiration from the CEO.

At Devicom, every project revolves around groups of individuals who work together and whose decisions have an immediate impact, both measurable and tangible, on the future of the company. \"Now I hire based on a person's understanding of and engagement with the company. That's why we have a lot of longstanding self-employed workers and former entrepreneurs on our new team,\" she explains.
