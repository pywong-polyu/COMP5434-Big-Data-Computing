It draws on a published compilation of 202 Emerging Infectious Zoonotic Disease (EIZD) events for the period 1940-2004. Of the 202 zoonotic EID events in the dataset, 74 (36.6%) were associated with animals kept for food production, which acted as reservoir for the zoonotic pathogen in 64 events and as intermediate / amplifying host in 8 events. Significant differences exist both in the characteristics of the causal agents and the drivers of emergence of zoonotic diseases from food animals and non-food animals. However, the prevailing policy debate on prevention, detection and control of EIZDs largely focuses on diseases of non-food animal origin (wildlife), neglecting the role of food animals. Policies and investments that ensure appropriate veterinary public health measures along and within food animal value chains are essential to mitigate the global risk of EIZDs, particularly in developing regions where the livestock sector is experiencing rapid growth and structural transformation.",

            "text": "Globally, the number of infectious disease outbreaks affecting humans has increased significantly since 1980 [26] and new virus species affecting humans are being discovered at an average rate of over 3 per year [37] . At least 60% of human emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) are zoonotic, i.e. stem from non-human hosts, and zoonotic pathogens are twice as likely to be associated with emerging diseases than non-zoonotic pathogens [15, 27] . Zoonotic pathogens emerge either from wildlife or from domesticated animals. In a seminal paper on \"Global trends in emerging infectious diseases\" covering the period from 1940 to 2004, Jones et al. [15] estimated that 72% of zoonotic EIDs (EIZDs) originated in wildlife. Woolhouse & Gowtage-Sequeria [36] identified changes in land use and agricultural practices and changes in human demographics and society as the two categories of drivers most frequently associated with the (re)emergence of human infectious diseases. The ranking of drivers across different categories of pathogen showed poor concordance, with one of the most notable differences being the greater importance of land use change and agricultural practices for zoonotic than for non-zoonotic diseases. Indeed, the transformation of the natural landscape promotes encroachment into wildlife habitats, thereby creating opportunities for closer and more frequent interactions between humans, livestock, wildlife and vectors, while the intensification of livestock farming, associated with increased animal numbers and density, facilitates disease transmission when effective management and biosecurity measures are not in place [14] .",

The US Agency for International Development, for instance, has spent around USD170 million over 8 years to conduct viral discovery in wildlife hosts [2] . This trend is likely to be reinforced by the recent emergence of COVID-19 [41] . The current narrative on preventing the next pandemic ( [3, 6, 16, 29, 34] ; US [30] ) stresses the role of wildlife in the emergence of human infectious diseases, while it appears to underappreciate the role food animals may play, despite the recognition that a considerable share of human diseases of evolutionary and historical significance originated in livestock [35] . The pathogen pool of food animals is itself not static but also constantly undergoing evolutionary changes. In swine, for example, a systematic review of publications between 1985 and 2010, found 173 new pathogen variants from 91 species, of which 73 species had not been previously described in pigs. One third of these new species was zoonotic and discovery of zoonotic species was more likely to occur in low-and middle-income than in high-income countries [12] .",

Projected growth in demand for meat and milk to 2050 (from 2015) is approximately five times higher in low/middleincome countries (LMICs) than in high-income countries (HICs), with sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) accounting for around one third of LMIC demand growth [7] . Concomitant to uneven global growth in demand for meat and milk, growth of livestock industries will be substantially Table 1 Pathogen characteristics and surmised driver of non-food animal associated (n = 128) and food animal associated (n = 74) EIZDs as reported by [15] Pathogen characteristics and surmised driver Non-food animal associated EIZD higher in the 'global South' with livestock numbers predicted to more than double in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) ( Table 2 ). The ongoing rapid expansion and intensification of livestock industries in LMICs without incorporation of the stringent biosecurity measures and animal health / veterinary oversight that have helped maintain the health and productivity of large herds in industrialized countries significantly enhances the likelihood of zoonotic disease emergence from food animals. Even HICs with high levels of veterinary oversight of animal industries have experienced important outbreaks of food animal associated EIZDs such as the BSE/vCJD crisis in the UK in the 1980s or the 2007 to 2010 Q fever epidemic in Holland, both linked to industry changes [18, 33] .",

The main drivers of food animal associated EIZDs are changes in agricultural practices at farm level and transformations of the food industries along the livestock value chain, from transporting through processing to retailing [15] . These two drivers play a minor role in the emergence of EIZDs from nonfood animals, which are primarily associated with land use changes and changes in human susceptibility. By promoting land use change, food animal production may indirectly contribute to the emergence of nonfood animal associated EIZDs.",

The World Bank [38] estimates that improving farm biosecurity in 139 LMICs would require an annual expenditure of between USD76 and 136 million (7.7% of all animal health expenditures), which is dwarfed by the historical costs of EIZDs of about USD6.9 billion/year. LMICs should thus prioritize the implementation of a minimum set of veterinary public health (VPH) measures in food animal productionsuch as animal vaccination, cleaning and disinfection and farm and market inspectionto reduce global pandemic risk. This holds particularly true for SSA, which is not only expected to undergo the most extensive changes in its livestock industries but is also the region with the lowest economic and institutional capacity to deal with EIZDs. SSA has the lowest per capita income among all world regions (PPP $ 3500 per year); the lowest per-capita health expenditure (PPP $ 200 per year); and the second lowest Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA) quality of public administration rating, an index of the extent to which governments are able to implement policies [40] . Growing trade volumes, increased national and international travel and migration, and high rates of urbanization, often associated with large informal urban settlements, vastly increase the potential spread and consequences of EIZDs.",

Their implementation, however, remains scattered and piecemeal [17, 19] . In most circumstances, lack of financial and human resources makes it challenging to ensure compliance with the existing veterinary public health legislation. For example, in two of the wealthier counties of Kenya, Kiambu and Nairobi City County, each public animal health officer is supposed to provide services to 1635 and 570 livestock farms, respectively, with an average annual budget of USD 2.1 and 3.1 per livestock farm [10] . Given such resource scarcity, LMICs governments should adopt a market-based approach to facilitate compliance with veterinary public health legislation and minimize the risk of EIZD events along the food animal value chain. Such an approach should primarily target mid-to large scale operators and include a research and an institutional pillar.",
