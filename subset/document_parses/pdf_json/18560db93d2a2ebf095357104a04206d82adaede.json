            "text": "Vaccination against COVID-19 with the recently approved mRNA vaccines BNT162b2 (BioNTech/Pfizer) and mRNA-1273 (Moderna) is currently underway in a large number of countries. However, high incidence rates and rapidly spreading SARS-CoV-2 variants are concerning. In combination with acute supply deficits in Europe in early 2021, the question arises of whether stretching the vaccine, for instance by delaying the second dose, can make a significant contribution to preventing deaths, despite associated risks such as lower vaccine efficacy, the potential emergence of escape mutants, enhancement, waning immunity, reduced social acceptance of off-label vaccination, and liability shifts. A quantitative epidemiological assessment of risks and benefits of non-standard vaccination protocols remains elusive. To clarify the situation and to provide a quantitative epidemiological foundation we develop a stochastic epidemiological model that integrates specific vaccine rollout protocols into a risk-group structured infectious disease dynamical model. Using the situation and conditions in Germany as a reference system, we show that delaying the second vaccine dose is expected to prevent COVID-19 deaths in the four to five digit range, should the incidence resurge in the first six months of 2021. We show that this considerable public health benefit relies on the fact that both mRNA vaccines provide substantial protection against severe COVID-19 and death beginning 12 to 14 days after the first dose. The model predicts that the benefits of protocol change are attenuated should vaccine compliance decrease substantially. To quantify the impact of protocol change on vaccination adherence we performed a large-scale online survey. We find that, in Germany, changing vaccination protocols may lead only to small reductions in vaccination intention depending on liability issues associated with postponing the second dose. In sum, we therefore expect the benefits of a strategy change to remain substantial and stable.",

            "text": "Large-scale vaccine rollouts against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) began on a world-wide scale at the end of 2020. Because of variable vaccine supplies, distribution and delivery protocols, national policies and vaccination strategies, the rate at which vaccines are administered varies substantially in different countries. For instance, Israel had reached a national vaccine coverage of more than 28% in the general population by Feb 16, 2021 and started vaccinating adolescents on Jan 23, 2021 [1] . By the same date, many European countries had only vaccinated a fraction of the population in the single digit percent range [2] [3] [4] [5] . In Germany, for example, by Feb 15, 2021 only 3% of the population had received the first dose and at the time of writing the vaccination progresses at approximately 120,000-150,000 persons per day [5] . Currently approved mRNA vaccines BNT162b2 (BioN-Tech/Pfizer) and mRNA-1273 (Moderna) are reported to be approximately 95% efficacious against COVID-19 disease after receiving two doses [6, 7] . Efficacy against severe COVID-19 and death is projected to be close to 100%, whereas overall risk reduction of infection by the causing agent severe * Correspondence email address: bfmaier@physik.hu-berlin.de acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is found to be less considerable [6] [7] [8] . Therefore, and because vaccination rates are limited by supply and infrastructural challenges, vaccination strategies typically prioritize the population at risk, i.e. the elderly, people with comorbidities, and people with high risk of exposure [9, 10] . The public health priority during this early phase is therefore the direct and effective reduction of severe COVID-19 cases and deaths in the high-risk groups as opposed to reducing transmission frequency in the general population.",

            "text": "According to the World Health Organization's Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization (SAGE) as well as manufacturers' recommendations, individuals that receive the first dose of the respective vaccine should receive the second dose after approximately 21 or 28 days, but no later than 42 days after the first dose [11, 12] . To comply with these recommendations, the current standard vaccine administration protocol that is applied in the majority of European countries provides the first dose immediately, and the second dose is withheld and stored appropriately to be used on the same individual 21 to 28 days later (see Fig. 1a ). Reserving the second dose, however, implies that the stock of available doses is depleted twice as fast as the number of people with first dose protection increases. Studies indicate that a substantial amount of protection is already delivered by the first dose [6] [7] [8] . After 12-14 days of receiving the initial dose, efficacy was approximately 89% and 92% for BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273, respectively [6, 7, 11, 12] . Supported by additional epidemiological data from Israel, this implies that the first dose provides almost complete protection against severe COVID-19 and death [6] [7] [8] [13] [14] [15] [16] . Consequently, a situation of severe vaccine scarcity could potentially be improved by instead of reserving the second dose on an individual basis, administering it to a second person on the same date, thereby doubling the initial vaccination rate and substantially reducing the time required to protect the high-risk population (see Fig. 1a ). Naturally, this would delay the administration of the second dose if vaccine supply is limited. Such a protocol is being followed in the UK, for instance, where the Joint Committee on Vaccination explicitly recommends to prioritize the first-dose vaccination of as many high-risk individuals as possible over a timely administration of the second dose [17] .",

Using a coarse-grain approximation, we divide the population into two groups: highrisk (which we define as having increased risk of death from FIG. 1. Vaccine administration protocols and simplified epidemiological model architecture. (a) In the standard protocol, every individual that receives a first dose is registered to receive a second dose 21 days later. The first dose is administered immediately, the second dose is reserved and appropriately stored for 21 days. In the extended in-label protocol, the second dose is not stored, but administered to a second individual instead. Both individuals will receive a second dose 42 days later (to stay within the time specifications of the manufacturers). In the extended off-label protocol, both individuals receive the second dose about 12 weeks (84 days) later, i.e. in the consecutive quarter (or earlier, if supply is sufficient). (b) We employ a modified susceptible-exposed-infectious-removed model with a latency period of 3.2 days and an infectious period of 6.7 days. The population consists of two risk groups with varying infection fatality rate-shown here is one layer for a single risk group. Risk group layers are coupled by infection terms that are proportional to the average number of contacts between individuals of the respective groups. Because the mRNA vaccines do not primarily protect against infection with SARS-CoV-2 but rather against COVID-19, all vaccinated individuals are classified as susceptible, associated with decreased susceptibility for protection levels 1 and 2, respectively. For increasing vaccine protection level, we assume increased efficacy against COVID-19 and COVID-19-related death. After receiving the first dose, individuals remain unprotected for approximately 14 days. We conservatively assume that initial protection remains constant and is not boosted for individuals that receive the second dose after 12 weeks (84 days). Note that we compute the number of deaths and symptomatic cases as the respective fractions of the \"removed\" compartment. infection) and low-risk (low risk of death from infection). We assume that the high-risk group comprises approx. 20% of the population, requiring swift and high-priority vaccination (see [9] and Supplementary Information (SI)). We model the average number of epidemiologically relevant contacts between individuals of one risk group to another risk group based on results by the POLYMOD study, using the 65+ age group as a proxy for the \"high-risk\" group and the <65 age group for \"low-risk\" [27, 28] . While the official definition for \"highrisk\" begins at age 70, individuals with co-morbidities are classified as \"high-risk\" as well, many of which belong to the age group 65-70 [29] . Based on empirical results, we expect that approx. 75%-80% (i.e. 12 million people) of the high-risk group are willing to get vaccinated (see Fig. 4a ). Additionally, we assume that 7 million individuals of the low-risk group are workers in the health care sector and consequently are vaccinated with high priority in concurrence with the high-risk population [9] . We calibrate the model based on the reported daily incidence and COVID-19-related deaths in Germany in 2020, yielding plausible values of infection fatality rates (IFRs) of 6.25% for the high-risk and 0.028% for the low-risk group [30] , further details are provided in the SI. We find an in-group base reproduction number of 0 = 2.2 for the low-risk group which we use to scale cross-group transmission rates accordingly (see SI). Additionally, we set an 83% probability of infected individuals to display symptoms of COVID-19 [31] .",

A vaccinated person is almost fully protected against COVID-19 related death approx. 14 days after receiving the first dose [8] . In the model we therefore set efficacy against death to be 99.9% after the first dose and increase it to 99.99% after two doses. We further expect that the efficacy against COVID-19 is 90% after the first dose as com-pared to 95% after receiving the second dose [6, 7] . We implement values of a 50% reduction in susceptibility approx. 14 days after receiving the first dose [8] , and assume an increase of susceptibility reduction to 60% after the second dose if administered according to the standard protocol, i.e. 21 days plus 14 days after the first dose. We assume that vaccination following the extended off-label protocol provides overall less protection against the disease compared to the standard and extended in-label protocols, respectively. These assumptions are conservative and deliberately underestimate the effectiveness of the second dose when administered with a 12 week delay. Fixed at a lower level, we additionally assume that vaccination protection does not decrease significantly in the first 12 weeks after receiving the first dose, and that, after 12 weeks, the second dose only maintains this protection rather than increasing it.",

In the \"improving\" scenario, the expected incidence continues to decrease over the first and second quarter of 2021, reaching a low, approximately constant level. In the \"slow resurgence\" scenario, the expected incidence ceases to decrease in the first quarter and increases again in the second quarter. In the \"fast resurgence\" scenario, expected incidence increases again on a shorter time-scale, typically causing a large epidemic wave in the second quarter or soon after. Note that for each scenario, individual trajectories of the base reproduction number 0 are stochastically simulated and therefore individual incidence curves can substantially differ for a fixed scenario (see SI for details). For each such realization, the model is analyzed with respect to different assumptions of vaccine efficacy and vaccine distribution/administration protocols. This approach permits a direct comparison of different strategies with respect to the same epidemic course in order to clearly evaluate all possible dynamic effects of a change in protocol. As an outcome, we measure the cumulative number of deaths and cumulative number of symptomatic COVID-19 cases in the high-risk group caused within the first 24 weeks (6 months) of the vaccine rollout.",

Such benefits are reached should incidence resurge, for instance in the case of the spread of one of the recently discovered more contagious viral variants-given that the existing vaccines are effective against these variants. This is true even for a low reduction in willingness to vaccinate induced by a change in protocol. A switch to extended protocols is even more beneficial when supply of vaccines remains limited. If nonpharmaceutical interventions show effect in the first half of 2021 and the incidence remains low over the first half of 2021, however, the number of deaths prevented by a change in protocol drops to lower values in the three-to four-digit range. The respective values are likewise reduced if vaccine efficacy is lower than anticipated but remain of similar magnitude nonetheless. If a change in strategy were adopted, damage to vaccine confidence and willingness to get vaccinated needs to be prevented. Results of the online survey in Germany showed that protocol changes would likely have only minimal detrimental effects on the willingness to get vaccinated. However, a shift in protocols would increase the need for communication measures as the survey also showed that deviating from the standard protocol was not the best preferred solution despite a high number of deaths prevented. In the course of a feasibility study it could be determined, for example, to what extent a voluntary three-month waiver of the second dose allows additional vaccinations without reducing the willingness to vaccinate, and whether the higher vaccination rate achieved in this way justifies potential other risks.",

ADE has not been shown after vaccination so far, neither after first nor second dose. Given the large number of people immunized so far and that ADE is likely to occur early in the course of vaccination, the risk appears to be small. An increased mutation pressure through the combination of imperfect immunity and high case loads (peak risk) cannot be ruled out. However, it is unclear if the delay of the second dose increases or decreases mutation pressure, since an early first dose reduces case load but may at the same time increase selection pressure, the net effect being unclear. Loss of protection of neutralizing antibody titers between first and second dose in extended second dose protocols is possible but unlikely given high titers following first dose mRNA vaccination.",

In fact, the model does not account for several of the widely discussed and difficult-to-calculate risks of postponing the second vaccination that must be taken into account when viewed as part of a practical public health guide line.

Therefore, we consider two parallel vaccine rollouts and divide the population in \"never had a SARS-CoV-2 infection\" (denoted by default compartment symbols such as 0 ) and \"currently are infected with SARS-CoV-2 or have been infected in the past\" (denoted by overlined compartment symbols 0 ). When picking a non-vaccinated individual to be vaccinated at random, the probability to pick a truly susceptible person is 0 /( 0 + 0 ), which means that the vaccine-related depletion of individuals with vaccine status zero is given as Parallel counting is introduced here because in Germany, infection status is not checked when administering vaccines, i. e. vaccines will be distributed equally to people that already went through the infection process. In order to simplify notation, we count infected individuals double, once to be regarded in the infection process and once to be regarded for the vaccination process. Individuals that received the first dose obtain a first protection level about 14 days after. Following the standard protocol (doses depleted from 2 , right arm of the schema), first-level protected individuals will receive the second, reserved dose 7 days after and reach the second protection level after an additional 14 days. Note that while 2 is linearly depleted with rate 2 , the number of corresponding individuals with first-level protection increases only with rate 2 /2 which reflects that per first-dose individual, two doses are depleted from the available vaccine stock. In the extended protocols (left arm of the schema), the second dose is administered according to a phase-and risk-specific reservoir for second doses ( 3 ).

Additionally reducing the adherence by 10% yields a reduction of 28% (\"improved\") and 42% (\"fast resurgence\") in \u0394 , respectively. In summary, doubling the assumed probability of showing symptoms despite having received the first dose leads to a \u2264 50% reduction in \u0394 , showing that even in this case, switching to the extended in-label or even to the extended off-label protocol would be beneficial.",

Regarding the extended off-label protocol, this reduction efficacy would yield an 11% to 15% reduction in prevented deaths (12% to 18% for a concurrent 10% reduction in adherence).

We define the total number of high-risk individuals that will be vaccinated according to a chosen base adherence. We also define the number of high-priority low-risk individuals to be 7 million. Available doses are split between risk groups proportionally to the number of high-priority individuals in each group. Once all high-priority individuals have received two doses, all remaining doses are distributed to the low-risk group.We further define one month to be 28 days long, in order to simplify distribution definitions in line with vaccine licensures. This implies that we integrate the model for 168 days, which according to our definitions amounts to 6 months. , c.f. Fig. 3 of the main text.",
