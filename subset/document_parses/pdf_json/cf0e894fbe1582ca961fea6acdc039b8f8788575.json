Nevertheless, most political power since then has been concentrated in the hands of the Greek Cypriot majority, with the other groups remaining largely marginalised. This hegemony of the Greek Cypriot political elite has been the result of a dual, and rather contradictory approach. On the one hand, the constitutional protections for the different groups have been eroded through the application of the doctrine of necessity, a mechanism intended to keep the Constitution up to date with the political developments in the country. Conversely, in cases where the doctrine could be used to safeguard the minorities' rights, the government has highlighted the unamendable nature of the Constitution and relied on the obsolete constitutional provisions that the doctrine of necessity was designed to avoid.",

            "text": "The 1960 Constitution of the Republic of Cyprus (henceforth, RoC or Republic) , 1 with its rigid and numerous unamendable provisions intended to protect the two communities that live on the island, has been described as one of the strictest constitutions in the world. 2 In addition to its community-specific protections, the Constitution includes a long Bill of Rights, which should be read alongside the Republic's obligations as a signatory to the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) and the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities. Yet, even a cursory look at Cyprus' sociopolitical scene today shows a very different picture from the one envisioned by the drafters of the Constitution. Rather than the Republic's state bodies reflecting the letter and spirit of the Constitution by protecting the communities and religious groups that make up its population -Greek Cypriots (GC), Turkish Cypriots (TC), Maronites, Armenians and Latins -the political power is largely exercised by the GC majority, with the three smaller religious groups being mostly marginalised and the members of the larger, TC community being almost completely ignored. This hegemony of the GC political elite is not an accident; rather, the erosion of the rights of TC and the religious groups has partly been the result of a dual, and rather contradictory, strategy. 3 On the one hand, the legislature has restricted their rights by arguing that the special political circumstances that exist on the island justify the departure from constitutional protections through the doctrine of necessity. On the other, and in cases where the doctrine of necessity could have been used as a tool to promote, rather than restrict, human rights, the argument has been that any limitations on these rights are mandated by the Constitution itself, whose relevant provisions are impossible to amend.",

            "text": "The article supports this argument by examining in a critical light the jurisprudence of the Supreme Court of Cyprus and the country-specific reports of the Advisory Committee on the Implementation of the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities. Section 2 briefly outlines Cyprus' political and constitutional context and Sect. 3 explains how the rigid constitutional provisions, coupled with the unstable political situation on the island, led to the birth and development of the doctrine of necessity. Section 4 discusses the theoretical criticisms that have been made against it, while Sect. 5 explores the way in which it has been applied in practice. Combined, these two sections contend that the use of the doctrine has indeed been necessary and can be defended from principled criticisms, but that its practical application over the years has been problematic. In particular, the uncritical use of the doctrine has contributed to the erosion of human rights and other constitutional provisions that were designed to protect the rights of TC and members of the three religious groups. Finally, Sect. 6 explores the other side of the coin by showing how, in cases where the doctrine of necessity could have been used for the protection of human rights, the government has chosen to rely instead on the bicommunal and unamendable nature of different constitutional provisions. As a result, these provisions, which were originally intended to protect the rights of minorities, have backfired and been used to their detriment.",

This division of the population along ethnic lines is not only limited to Article 2; it runs through the entire text of the Constitution and is prevalent in every aspect of its provisions. To give but one example, recruitment to the public service is regulated on a ratio of 7:3 for GC and TC respectively. 11 Allocation by quotas is also the rule of thumb for independent institutions and other 4 Polyviou (2015), 6. 5 Crawford (2006), 242. 6 For a theoretical analysis of the challenges faced by multinational societies and the responses they tend to adopt to these, in the form of constitutional asymmetry, as in the case of Cyprus, see in this volume Sahad\u017ei\u0107 (2020). 7 Department of Statistics and Research (1963) . This is the last reliable census that took place in Cyprus. 8 Constitution, Article 2(1). 9 Ibid., Article 2(2). 10 For a discussion and partial challenge of the classical liberal tradition, see Kymlicka (1995) . 11 Constitution, Article 62(2). public offices. 12 Moreover, the system includes many checks and balances, such as the veto power granted both to the (GC) President and the (TC) Vice-President, 13 and the requirement for double majorities in the House of Representatives on a range of issues that seek to protect the interests of the numerically smaller TC community. 14 While the Constitution pays sufficient -or even, one could say, excessive -attention to the protection of GC and TC, it adopts a diametrically opposite approach to the rights of Maronites, Armenians and Latins. Most problematically, it does not envision the option of non-participation in either of the two dominant communities. Citizens are free to opt to belong to the community of their choice and exit from it, but should they decide to exit one, they would automatically be delegated to the other community. 15 Due to this, soon after independence, the three religious minority groups were asked to choose membership in either of the two dominant communities, with all three opting for inclusion in the GC majority. 16 The principal repercussion of this was that the political participation of the three groups was mediated solely through the dominant segment of the population. However, since their members could not fully satisfy the definitions of either of the two dominant communities found in Article 2, the requirement that they participate in the polity through one of these, put a straightjacket to the development of their identity. 17 The operation of such strict constitutional provisions rendered necessary the existence of a surplus of goodwill and mutual trust, as sine qua non conditions. Due to the lack thereof, soon after the Constitution's adoption, and before it even became fully operational, problems arose between the governing GC and TC elites and poisoned inter-communal relations. 18 Reflecting the GC dissatisfaction with the then state of affairs, in 1963, President (and Archbishop) Makarios submitted a proposal for amendments to the Constitution that are widely referred to as the '13 points'. 19 The main thrust of this proposal, which sought to radically change the Constitution, was the abolition of the TC Vice-President's veto and of the double majorities in the House of Representatives, as well as a downward revision of TC representation in the public service and security forces to reflect the actual population ratio.",

In particular, it should be recalled that the majority of the population has been identifying itself and the RoC, not as Cypriot, but as Greek.

One of the first actions of the (now exclusively GC) House of Representatives was to pass the Administration of Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Law 33 of 1964. The Law established a new Supreme Court and provided that temporarily and 'until such time as the people of Cyprus may determine such matters', 24 this Court would exercise the jurisdiction of both the Supreme Constitutional Court and the High Court. These two Courts, according to Articles 133 and 153 of the Constitution, were staffed by GC, TC and international 20 Drousiotis (2008), 151. 21 Mahmoud (2020) in this volume argues that a constitution-making (or constitution-amending) process can be reconciliatory when it entails the participation of the communities and relies on a national dialogue based on principles of mutual respect, inclusivity, deliberation and justice.

Since their international members had either retired or resigned, 25 the concern was that their incomplete composition would render them unable to function; thus, the rationale of the Law was to device a solution that addressed this. 26 Ibrahim arose when a TC defendant argued before the newly merged Supreme Court that it had no jurisdiction to hear the criminal case against him, since its existence was not provided by the Constitution.

Yet, this argument fails to take into account the realities on the ground: since 1963, Cyprus has joined international organisations, participated in international forums and been the subject of numerous UN resolutions, all of which confirm its existence as a state. 35 Moreover, state practice in international law, and in particular the events that unfolded after the collapse of the USSR, suggest that even fundamental constitutional changes do not necessarily affect an entity's status as a recognised state. 36 The second principled argument against Ibrahim is that it carves out a hole in the overall legal regime by overriding Article 183 of the Constitution. Article 183 allows for a declaration of a state of emergency, which in turn, can result in the suspension of certain of the Constitution's guarantees. Thus, the fallacy of the doctrine of necessity is premised on the argument that the Constitution already provided an available legal route to the GC community, that of declaring a state of emergency, which was not put to the test. This argument draws support from 36 For instance, the USSR underwent significant constitutional changes in the beginning of the 1990s, but the Russian Federation, as its successor, remained an internationally recognised state and maintained its permanent seat at the UN Security Council. a few months before the withdrawal of the TC officials from the government. 37 In that case, the majority of the Court unequivocally stated that under a written Constitution, such as that of the Republic of Cyprus, which expressly provides for extraordinary competences to overcome certain defined situations of emergency, there can be no implied power, outside of such express constitutional provisions, of any organ of the Republic to override, in a case of \"necessity\", competences of other organs, and to step beyond the limits of its own competences or to act without the basis of a law. 38",

Thus, the use of this doctrine creates a judicially sponsored situation, which justifies derogation from, or non-application of, human rights without following the internationally prescribed legal path. Despite the merit of this argument, it is not something that has been picked up by the European Court of Human Rights itself. In fact, the Court has implicitly approved the existence of the doctrine in Aziz v. Cyprus when it referred to, and accepted the need for, legal mechanisms designed to address 'the anomalous situation that began in 1963'. 41 It appears therefore that the problem with the doctrine of necessity is not so much one of principle; rather, as the next section suggests, it is one of application.",

Bank of Cyprus. 42 The case concerned the constitutionality of the Debtors' Relief (Temporary Provisions) Law 24 of 1979, which was passed in order to address the calamities that took place in 1974. In the summer of 1974, the Greek Junta government and right-wing GC paramilitaries orchestrated an unsuccessful military coup against President Makarios. A few days later, and with the pretext that it was protecting the TC and that it was exercising its rights as a guarantor power, Turkey invaded Cyprus. As a result of the Turkish invasion, a population transfer ensued and more than 200,000 Cypriots became displaced: as 165,000 GC were fleeing to safety in the south of the island, 45,000 TC trekked to the Turkish-controlled north. 43 In response to these facts, Law 24/1979 provided that the right of creditors to recover debt from displaced debtors and to charge interest was suspended during the period between 1974 and 1982. The Court, deciding on the constitutionality of the Law, held that even if these provisions entailed limitations beyond the acceptable ones to the creditors' right to property, they were justified by the doctrine of necessity. While fundamental rights should be respected 'during a period of normality', the exceptional circumstances that existed (and still do exist) in Cyprus because of the 1974 invasion, called for their restriction. 44 Ambrosia Oils developed the doctrine of necessity in two important new ways: first, it established that the 'Turkish invasion threatened the existence of society and social institutions with collapse'; as a result, like the events of 1963, it warranted, and in fact justified to an even greater degree than before, the use of the doctrine of necessity. 45 On the face of it, this is a persuasive argument: the 1974 war resulted in an unprecedented humanitarian catastrophe, to which the state's institutions were asked to respond. If ever there was an emergency and a necessity to address it, this was it. Nevertheless, despite the significant human cost of the Turkish invasion, there were no additional legal or institutional changes to the ones that took place in 1963 that made it even harder to comply with the Constitution. Constitutionally speaking, after the war, the Cypriot state institutions could -and should -continue operating using the same procedures and respecting the same safeguards as they did before the war. While therefore the Supreme Court was right to use the doctrine of necessity after the events of 1963, it was wrong to extend the same reasoning to those of 1974.",

The Custodian, however, restricts the return to, and use of, these properties by their owners until the end of the 'abnormal situation [\u2026] created as a result of the Turkish invasion'. 53 The enforcement of this Law has prompted a number of applications before the Supreme Court by TC owners wishing to challenge its constitutionality and alleging a violation of their right to property. 54 The Supreme Court has consistently rejected these applications basing its reasoning on the doctrine of necessity.",

As a result of this abnormal situation, the State, through the Custodian, had the duty to take measures in order to protect the properties of TC, which laid abandoned. 57 According to the Court therefore, the doctrine of necessity not only justified, but in fact mandated the restriction of TC's property rights.

In turn, this lack of clarity has made it very difficult for the Court to engage in a proportionality analysis. Thus, even if it could be accepted that it was necessary to protect TC properties, the Court never seriously questioned whether Law 139/1991 achieved this objective. Moreover, even if the Custodian was indeed the best institution to protect the properties in the absence of their owners, it was never explained why this remained the case, even after they declared their wish and ability to take up this responsibility themselves. These questions became increasingly difficult to answer when the Supreme Court accepted in a subsequent case, that Law 139/1991 was justified under the doctrine of necessity, not only because it protected TC properties, but also because it was in the interest of GC displaced people, who were housed there. 58 The argument here is not that the Court's ultimate conclusion in Solomonides was necessarily wrong. It might indeed be the case that restricting the TC's property rights was both a necessary and proportionate response. However, the Court's open-ended reasoning in reaching this conclusion was unpersuasive because it did not explain why this was the case. It did not clarify whether Law 139/1991 sought to protect the interests of TC or GC and, crucially, it did not question whether these two objectives contradicted with each other. In turn, this made it even more difficult to delineate and tightly control the restriction of the right to property in subsequent cases, with even more detrimental effects for the right holders themselves.",

While the judiciary was justified in considering the doctrine a temporary measure in the 1960s and 1970s, as the decades passed, this argument became less persuasive. Arguably, the Court could have upheld the constitutionality of the Custodian's powers by reasoning that the limitation of the right to property was necessary and proportionate for the public interest, without invoking the doctrine of necessity, and its temporary nature, at all. Therefore, the judges' decision to rely on the doctrine, rather than Article 33 of the Constitution, potentially detracted from, rather than enhanced, the persuasiveness of their argument.",

Rather, it impliedly accepted that the continuing occupation of the northern part of Cyprus suffices as a justification for the introduction and validity of the impugned Law and failed to consider the RoC's obligation to seek new mechanisms to avoid the deprivation of the effet utile of the right. 62",

While the TC Communal Chamber ceased to exist in 1963 after the withdrawal of its members from the House of Representatives, the GC one continued with business as usual until 1965, at which time its members voted to dissolve it. Representatives of the religious minorities had a right to be consulted during the proceedings of the Communal Chamber, but did not have any voting rights 65 ; the Chamber's selfdissolution therefore, was exclusively the decision of its GC members. As a result of this decision, the (GC) House of Representatives decided to allocate the Chamber's powers partly to itself and partly to a newly formed Ministry of Education. 66 The Supreme Court has ruled on several occasions that the self-dissolution of the GC Communal Chamber was justified under the doctrine of necessity. 67 Yet, this is a surprising conclusion considering that the GC Communal Chamber did not consist of any TC and it could -and in fact did -continue operating even after the events of 1963. 68 When deciding on the matter, the Court has limited itself to declaring that the House of Representatives has relied on the doctrine of necessity. Yet, it has not engaged in even a rudimentary assessment of whether the criteria set out in Ibrahim have been satisfied. Moreover, the Court has never mentioned, let alone evaluated using the Ibrahim proportionality test, how the dissolution of the Communal Chamber has affected the interests of the Maronites, Armenians and Latins, who were relying on it to communicate their views.",

It is in light of these facts, that one applicant, a Cypriot citizen residing in the areas controlled by the Republic and belonging to the Turkish community, requested his registration to the GC electoral roll. The argument was that the applicant's continued registration in the TC electoral register, coupled with the fact that that this remained inactive since 1963, essentially resulted in his 71 Kyriakou and Kaya (2011). 72 The 'basic articles' of the Constitution, which can never be amended, are listed in Article 182 and Annex III of the Constitution. 73 Constitution, Articles 46, 62, 123 and 130. 74 Constitution, Article 94. 75 Aziz, para 26. disenfranchisement.

The first focused on the fact that the Constitution already provided mechanisms through which TC could be allowed to vote. 77 Little attention was paid to the substance of the applicant's claim, namely that these mechanisms had not been used -and indeed could not have been used because of the application of the doctrine of necessity -since 1963. While in its right to property case law the Court did not refer to the need to maintain the bicommunal character of the Constitution, here it was quick to point out that 'the right to vote is directly related to the communal provisions that provide for the creation of separate electoral rolls and separate elections for the representatives from each community.' 78 The ideal of one person-one vote, the Court continued, did not allow it to amend the Constitution.",

            "text": "The Court's second argument related directly to the doctrine of necessity. It held in essence, that it was impossible to rely on this legal mechanism because the only body that could signify the existence of a need to be addressed using the doctrine, was the legislature. Since the House of Representatives was aware of the applicant's -and others' in a similar position -disenfranchisement, yet decided to do nothing, the judiciary could not use the doctrine of necessity on its own to fix the problem. Exhibiting a newly-found attachment to the Constitution, the Court concluded that 'the nature of the doctrine of necessity does not intend the bending or setting aside of the Constitutional order, but only its support.' 79 Thus, instead of the bicommunality provisions in the Constitution being used as a shield to protect the rights of TC, they were transformed into a sword and in effect justified the restriction of these very rights. 80 It is not only the rights of TC that have been limited due to a strict adherence to the Constitution. While the RoC is a signatory to the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities (FCNM), it has resisted any calls for change in the status of the three religious groups by pointing to the rigidness and unamendability of 76 Ibid., 502 [authors' translation] . 80 The case was eventually heard by the ECtHR, which held that the disenfranchisement of TC residing in the areas controlled by the Republic on the ground of their ethnic origin constitutes both a violation of the right to vote and of freedom from discrimination (Aziz.). certain constitutional provisions. 81 One of the most long-standing complaints of these groups, for which the FCNM Advisory Committee has also expressed concern, is that the constitutional requirement to be considered members of either the GC or TC community, unduly restricts their right to self-identify. 82 Linked to this, is the additional concern that because of this provision, the Constitution does not include effective mechanisms through which Maronites, Armenians and Latins can be effectively consulted for matters that relate to them.",

Illustrative of this is the response of the government to the first report of the FCNM Advisory Committee, which acknowledges the restrictions on the right to self-identify, explains them through the prism of the bicommunal nature of the Constitution, yet ultimately concludes that '[t]he issue of affiliation cannot be a priority at present, but it could be examined in any future revision of the Constitution'. 84 Such a revision however, 'is definitely inappropriate at this point in time in view of the fact that in the case of Cyprus there are, admittedly, particular circumstances to be taken into account' 85 (meaning the unresolved Cyprus issue).",

            "text": "A similar adherence to the letter of the Constitution is recorded, even when the religious groups make mere symbolic demands that would have been easy to meet, had the political willingness been present. For example, the Latins have requested that they are referred to in a term that reflects their Roman Catholic religion more accurately. 86 Similarly, the Maronites and Armenians have argued that they should be regarded as ethnic groups or national minorities rather than religious groups, since religion is not their only distinguishing characteristic. 87 The FCNM Advisory Committee has noted that these demands could be met even without constitutional amendments, yet this possibility has not been entertained by the Cypriot government. 88 In any case, despite the RoC's statements to the contrary, it is possible to amend, or at least circumvent the Constitution, through the doctrine of necessity. This was the view of the Supreme Court, which, following a long saga of cases, 81 The Convention applies to the three religious groups, which are considered a 'minority', but not the TC because under the Constitution, they have a different status as a 'community'. 82 concluded that the doctrine could be used to amend the Constitution itself, rather than merely pass legislation that was not in line with constitutional provisions. 89 It is ironic that, rather than choosing this route, the RoC has justified the restrictions on minority rights by effectively invoking the most essential and prominent bicommunality provisions that exist in the text of the Constitution. Therefore, the practice of the RoC, taken as a whole, is arguably contradictory. On the one hand, since the proposal to amend the Constitution on the basis of the '13 points', the GC political elite has mostly attempted to sideline the bicommunal facets of the Constitution by using the doctrine of necessity. On other occasions, it has invoked the very bicommunal nature of the Constitution in order to confront the criticism addressed to the State for its refusal to amend problematic constitutional provisions.",

            "text": "What emerges from the judicially sanctioned application of the doctrine of necessity is that it has often been used to provide a legal gloss for the exclusion of non-GC from the public sphere, as well as deprive them of their individual constitutional rights. Following the events of 1963 and 1974, the automatic application of the doctrine has resulted in asymmetrical results. Although on the domestic plane it was initially used as a shield, devised to safeguard the effective functioning of the institutions of the Republic, it was later transformed into a sword, serving the assertive exclusion of non-GC from participating in the structures and being protected by the laws of the RoC. At the same time, internationally, and particularly when addressing the rights of religious minorities, the doctrine has remained completely dormant with all attention being focused on the need to respect the bicommunal character of the Constitution. Especially after the failed reunification referenda for the adoption of a UN-sanctioned comprehensive peace settlement, 90 the feeling of ownership of the Republic has been on the rise within the GC community, which has lent support to the phenomena described above. 91 In this sense, (GC) President Papadopoulos' statement on the eve of the referenda is both telling and emblematic of this turn: 'I was given an internationally recognised state. I am not going to give back a community'. 92 In Cyprus' case, monopolising power and dominating the law were conflated into a single mechanism and were inextricably linked to each other. Arguably, the majority's attempt to rid of the 'dysfunctional' parts of the 1960 Constitution by sidelining the principle of bicommunality, initially through the '13 points', was later transformed into the doctrine of necessity. In other words, the doctrine was not a value-free judicial choice made in the course of the criminal proceedings for the Ibrahim case, but the continuation of the politics of ethnic antagonism by other means. The doctrine of necessity has indeed served the existence and effective operation of the institutions of the Republic, but it has also provided a justification for the implicit claim over the whole Republic by the GC political elite. 93 Little, if any, of these problems concern, or are even noticed by, the average GC. The Constitution and the practices that stem from it 'though illiberal, [are] experienced as liberal by those who benefit from' them. 94 This state of affairs has gone unnoticed, undiscussed and unchallenged for so long precisely because it has, slowly but surely, entrenched the position, power and sense of entitlement of the majority.",
