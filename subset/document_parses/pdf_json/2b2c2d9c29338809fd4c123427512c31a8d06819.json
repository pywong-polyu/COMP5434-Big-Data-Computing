Without public health response, exponential spread of the virus will stress intensive care capacity, as has been seen in Wuhan, Lombardy, Madrid, Strasbourg, London and New York. Second, COVID-19 has a considerable mortality in individuals >65 year and individuals with co-morbidity or obesity, while mortality in healthy individuals <65 years is relatively low. 2 To address these problems, all countries confronted with COVID-19 have put public health strategies in place, varying from social distancing recommendations to nationwide lockdowns, commonly including for example stay-at-home orders, school closures, curfew and restrictions on within-country travel. The aim of these strategies is either suppression -reverse epidemic growth, reducing case numbers to low levels and maintaining that situation indefinitely (while waiting for a vaccine or better treatment options) -or mitigation (flatten the curve), the latter aiming to slow but not necessarily stop epidemic spread. 3, 4 Herd immunity might be a side product of mitigation. 5 While many involved countries have implemented a strict lockdown, Sweden went against the grain by keeping public life less restricted. 6 Here, we perform an economic analysis balancing .

We confirmed the COVID-19 mortality with the national birth statistics. In Denmark the absolute number of people that died between March-August 2020 (week 10-34) was on average 64 per million higher than in 2015-2019, while in Sweden this number was 502 per million higher (difference 438 per million). In our calculations, the difference between Sweden and Denmark was very comparable with 503 COVID-19 related additional deaths per million in Sweden. Also, as there is considerable debate on the contagiousness and mortality of SARS-CoV-2, we only used COVID-19 related mortality rates per million and economic impact.",

In view of the extreme impact that COVID-19 disease has on health and health systems when it is left uncontrolled, a first response of lockdown is understandable and defendable. However, our analysis also shows that the Swedish more liberal policy, despite it higher mortality rates, is acceptable and in terms of cost-effectiveness not as bad as is perceived when one assesses the absolute number of COVID-19 related deaths. is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in (which was not certified by peer review) preprint",

Per million inhabitants, a US$ 1.9 billion decrease (3.9%) per million inhabitants was estimated for Sweden. The additional costs for Denmark represent the variance to the Sweden estimate. The additional reduction in GDP per million inhabitants was estimated to be US$ 743 million per million inhabitants. The incremental costs to save one life year from a strict lockdown were therefore US$ 137,285 per life year saved. Threshold analysis indicated that for the base case, and assuming US$ 100,000 as maximum cost to be spend for a life year saved, Denmark would per million inhabitants be willing to spend US$ 510 million per million inhabitants. This corresponds with a total additional budget to be spent of US$ 3.0 billion. In August, SARS-CoV-2 infection rates were low in all three countries, with 73 per million inhabitants in Sweden, while this rate was 9 per million inhabitants per month in Denmark. In August, COVID-19 related mortality rates were 7 and 2 per million inhabitants per month for Sweden and Denmark, respectively. Sensitivity analysis Sensitivity analysis indicated that variation of the lost-life years from an individual dying with COVID-19 between 15 years and 2 years resulted in a cost-effectiveness varying between US$100,676 and US$755,068 per life year saved.
