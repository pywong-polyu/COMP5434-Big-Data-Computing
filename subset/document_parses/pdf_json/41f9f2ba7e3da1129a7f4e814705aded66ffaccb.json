Although it is a relatively widespread and wellknown concept, as far as we know, there are no validated instruments for its measurement. This lack of previous instruments means that we approached the construction of the scale and proposed its potential sub-dimensions without incorporating previous tools to develop the items, so they were thus theoretically built. The definitions given by a number of international institutions and authors [4] [5] [6] suggest that this construct could be built on the basis of two different dimensions: demotivation in continuing to follow the recommended PB-that is the primary definition of PF stated by the WHO and other authors [4, 5, 9] -and boredom regarding overexposure to pandemic-related information.",

Nevertheless, the second potential dimension proposed for PF-boredom regarding overexposure to pandemic-related information-requires more attention and the description of the conceptual framework. First, mental health is negatively affected by the experience of strict measures and overexposure to negative information in the media about the pandemic, two aspects that exacerbate the risk of developing post-traumatic stress disorder [10] . It has thus been shown that disclosure of generic and detailed information has the power to increase risk perception and panic in pandemic situations [11] . Moreover, information overload through social media during the pandemic has been shown to heighten social media fatigue [12] . Some authors also refer to messaging fatigue related to the pandemic as fatigue due to chronic and long-term exposure to repeated messages regarding pandemic-related information [13] . Boredom regarding overexposure to pandemic-related information thus seems to be a plausible dimension of PF. Consequently, PF can be defined as a negative attitude toward PB related to the pandemic situation which results from feelings of emotional exhaustion associated with the chronification of COVID-19 restrictions and with overexposure to COVID-19 related information [4] [5] [6] . To construct a psychometrically sound measure, the PFS was conceptualized with these two expected dimensions: 1) demotivation in continuing to follow the recommended PB (called neglect) and 2) boredom regarding the pandemic-related information (called boredom). Thus, our first hypothesis (H1) is that the PFS will present a bifactorial structure corresponding to those two dimensions.",

In this sense, personal values aligned with conservation, which are oriented both toward the collective interests and toward protection [14] , have been related with normative behavior related to COVID-19 prevention [15] . In the first phase of confinement due to the COVID- 19 pandemic, individuals oriented toward conservation-who give high relevance to both security and conformity-adopted more protective and normative behaviors [15] . Thus, considering that both conformity and security orientation embody social values of conservation that orient individuals to self-protection [14] , we hypothesize that individuals who hold high security and conformity values will show lower PF, and above all a lower demotivation to follow PB as a consequence of the prolonged pandemic situation (meaning a lower level of the neglect dimension of PF), which is the dimension of the PFS that is most related to security (H2).",

In short, the TPB [16, 19] , explains the motivational influences on behavior by proposing the mediating role of behavioral intention in the relationship of different other unanticipated events or factors-attitudes, social norms, and behavioral control-with behavior. Thus, it posits that behavioral intention is the direct predictor or immediate antecedent of behavior, but that a variety of unanticipated events may prevent individuals from turning their intentions into action. Therefore, framed by the TPB, we expect that the intention to adopt PB related to the pandemic situation could mediate the relation of both proposed dimensions of PF with the PB individuals carry out. Moreover, the perception that individuals have about whether other individuals of significance for them (friends, family, people with whom they usually interact) engage in these kinds of PB related to the pandemic situation (meaning the perceived social norms) could also be a relevant predictor of their intention to adopt PB, acting as a sort of pressure to behave in a determined way. Finally, the perception that PB related to the pandemic situation are difficult to follow (meaning the perceived behavioral control) could also predict both the behavioral intention to behave in a protective way and the actual PB. In this sense, we propose that the behavioral intention to adopt PB related to COVID-19 prevention will mediate the relations of both dimensions of PF-neglect (H5a) and boredom (H5b)-with COVID-19 PB; in the same way, behavioral intention will mediate the relations of (H5c) social norm perceptions about PB and (H5d) perceived behavioral control with COVID-19 PB (See the predictive model in Supplementary Figure 1) .",

Other studies have found that women usually adopt more PB oriented to preventing SARS-CoV-2 transmission [22] [23] [24] , probably because women usually assign more relevance to health issues than do men [25] . In this sense, we expect that women will present lower levels of the neglect dimension of PF. The exhaustion due to the prolonged crisis and its associated reiterative, chronic, and strict restrictions and overexposure to negative information related to the pandemic will probably influence men and women similarly regarding the dimension of boredom; nevertheless, because women are more focused on health than are men, this fatigue will probably entail a lower demotivation to follow the recommended PB to prevent SARS-CoV-2 transmission on women compared to men (H6).",

As expected, the neglect dimension of the PFS correlated with personal values of both security and conformity. In accordance with previous studies [15] , which have shown that individuals with higher conservation values adopt higher PB, the results confirmed that the more individuals are oriented toward self-protection, with high conservation values (high conformity and security), the less they feel unmotivated to follow PB as a consequence of the prolonged pandemic situation and the chronic nature of restrictions (meaning lower values for the neglect dimension of the PFS). This seems logical, because people with high personal values of conformity and security are characterized by a high orientation toward self-protection [14] , and thus, to protect themselves they will continue being motivated to engage in PB even in a situation of chronic restrictions [15] .",

            "text": "Nevertheless, the boredom factor of the PFS was only marginally related to personal values of security and not correlated with conformity. Again, this result provides more evidence for the bidimensionality of the PFS. The boredom factor is not so related to security as the neglect scale. It represents a demotivation not to follow the PB related to COVID-19 transmission, but to follow the information related to the pandemic, as well as demotivation provoked by the prolonged overexposure of negative COVID-19 information. In this sense, if not following the PB could be perceived as a relevant problem for individual self-protection, not following the information regarding the evolving pandemic may not be perceived as a relevant problem for self-protection, and thus the boredom factor must not be related to social values oriented toward self-protection, such as security and conformity [14] . The expected relationships also emerged between the pandemic scale and its dimensions with the intention to adopt and actual adoption of PB oriented to avoid COVID-19 exposure. As expected, and considering that the PF construct is conceived as a feeling of demotivation due to the prolonged pandemic situation and its associated stricter restrictions and information overload [4] , and therefore it has an inherent motivational component, the results showed that the more individuals perceived PF (in both its neglect and boredom dimensions), the less they presented intentions to behave in a protective way and the less they adopted PB against COVID-19. People who, because of the chronic nature of the crisis, feel unmotivated to follow PB (neglect dimension of the PF construct) showed lower intention to adopt PB and reported lower PB. These results are in accordance not only with the definition of the PF construct itself [4] but also with the claims of other authors [3, 7] . In the same way, people who, because of the chronic nature of the crisis, feel unmotivated to follow the pandemic-related information (boredom dimension of the PF construct) also showed lower intention to adopt PB; nevertheless, no relation was found between the boredom dimension of the PFS and the adoption of PB. This lack of relation may be due to other variables that may be more relevant and act as mediators in the behavioral process, as indicated by the TPB [16, 19, 26] and as we have seen on the mediational analyses preformed.",

The mediation analyses confirmed the expected mediating role of intention to behave in a protective way against COVID-19. Moreover, the expected relations were supported in the path analysis. Therefore, both PF dimensions, as well as perceived social norms and behavioral control, predicted individual PB through the behavioral intention. Thus, these results suggest that, meanwhile-due to the chronic nature of the public health crisis-although feelings of demotivation to follow the recommended PB against COVID-19 and the information regarding the pandemic can produce a reduction in individual PB, the more direct predictive factor of COVID-19 seems to be the intention to behave in a protective way and the perception of difficulty or ease in performing these behaviors, as suggested by the TPB [16, 19, 26] .",

Thus, even with a demotivation to perform COVID-related PB and to follow COVID-related information due to the prolonged pandemic situation, people may have high intention to behave in a protective way, maybe because they perceive that their reference group expects them to behave in a protective way (meaning that they have a high perceived social norm), or because they perceive those PB as very easy to perform. In contrast, even if people are not demotivated to perform COVID-related PB and to follow COVID-related information due to the prolonged pandemic situation, they may have no intention to behave in a protective way because they perceive that their reference group usually does not adopt these kinds of PB or because they perceive that the behaviors are very hard to adopt.",

These results are congruent with previous studies that women adopt more PB related to COVID-19 prevention [22] [23] [24] , and thus they support the external validity of the PFS. This gender difference in the COVID-19 PB could be explained by the differential socialization experienced by men and women, in which women are usually socialized to be more self-protection oriented [25] and more obedient and disciplined [34] .

Nonetheless, it can be highlighted that, with slight wording modifications, the scale might be useful and suitable in other epidemic or pandemic situation related to other viruses, to more general health situations, or in coping with uncertain health situations that also can produce fatigue in individuals. Finally, some additional dimensions could have been explored for the scale development, such as considering not only messaging fatigue, but also desensitization toward information during a pandemic [13] or physical fatigue.
