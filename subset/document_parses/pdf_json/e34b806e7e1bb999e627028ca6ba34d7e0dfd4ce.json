            "text": "Background. Traditional Chinese medicine Yinhuapinggan granule (YHPG) has been used for treating upper respiratory tract infection like influenza, cough, and viral pneumonia. However, its active ingredients that really exert the main efficacy have not been well elucidated. This study is aimed at screening its antiviral components and investigating the potential therapeutic mechanisms of YHPG against the influenza A/PR8/34 (H1N1) virus in Madin Darby canine kidney (MDCK). Methods. MDCK cells were infected with the influenza virus and then treated with ribavirin, YHPG, and main active ingredients in YHPG. Based on the maximum nontoxic concentration (TC 0 ), half-maximal toxic concentration (TC 50 ), half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC 50 ), and therapeutic index (TI), interferon-\u03b2 (IFN-\u03b2) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and the gene expression of TLR7, MyD88, tumor necrosis factor receptorassociated factor 6 (TRAF6), c-Jun amino terminal kinase (JNK), p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK), and p65 nuclear transcription factor-kappa B (p65 NF-\u03baB) was quantified using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Results. The results indicated that the components of YHPG, such as ephedrine hydrochloride, pseudoephedrine hydrochloride, chlorogenic acid, and emodin, had significant antiviral effects. High and medium doses of YHPG effectively reduced the cytopathic effect (CPE) and significantly decreased IFN-\u03b2 and IL-6 levels in the supernatant. Simultaneously, the transcript levels of TLR7, MyD88, TRAF6, JNK, p38 MAPK, and p65 NF-\u03baB decreased in infected MDCK cells. Moreover, a certain dose-dependent relationship among different groups of YHPG was observed. Conclusions. These results indicated that YHPG and the components of YHPG had a significant inhibitory function on the proliferation of the H1N1 virus. The mechanism might be associated with suppressing the activation of the TLR7/MyD88 signaling pathway, a decrease in the mRNA expression of key target genes, and inhibition of IFN-\u03b2 and IL-6 secretion.",

            "text": "Influenza, which has a high incidence, extensive prevalence, and rapid dissemination, is an acute respiratory tract infection caused by the influenza virus of the family Orthomyxoviridae. The virus can be divided into the A, B, and C types based on the nucleoprotein's antigenic characteristics. The influenza A virus tends to undergo antigenic drift, causing worldwide pandemics and seriously threatening human health. Current drug treatment for viruses mainly includes M2 ion channel and neuraminidase inhibitors such as amantadine and oseltamivir [1, 2] . Despite their availability, these drugs often fail quickly due to surface antigen variation. Compared with synthetic chemical drugs, traditional Chinese medicines (TCM) against the influenza virus have the advantages of multiple targets and insignificant adverse side effects [3] . Therefore, the development and use of natural medicine and related mechanisms are necessary.",

It is mainly composed of Flos Lonicerae Japonicae, Herba Ephedrae, Puerariae Lobatae Radix, Polygoni Cuspidati Rhizoma, Armeniacae Semen Amarum, and Glycyrrhizae Radix, with a ratio of 4 : 4 : 4 : 2 : 2 : 1 ( Table 1) . The high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis of YHPG has been performed using an established method in our lab (Supplementary Figure 1) [4] . Clinical trials show that YHPG had good clinical efficacy and safety [5, 6] . Previous studies have shown that YHPG significantly inhibited influenza virus replication in chicken embryos in vitro [7] . In vivo, YHPG was reported to relieve lung tissue injury in mice infected with the influenza A virus [8] and to possess antitussive [9] , anti-inflammatory, and analgesic [10] properties. YHPG also reduced and regulated immune functions in mice, which might be associated with the regulation of Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling pathways [4] . Thus, to elucidate the mechanism of YHPG-induced anti-influenza viral activity, this study observed the in vitro antiviral effect of YHPG in MDCK cells by examining the levels of interferon-\u03b2 (INF-\u03b2) and interleukin-6 (IL-6), as well as the expression levels of target genes of TLR7, MyD88, TRAF6, JNK, p38 MAPK, and p65 NF-\u03baB in MDCK cells infected with influenza virus. Simultaneously, we should understand the anti-influenza virus components in YHPG. This study may provide an experimental basis for further systematic research on YHPG that may promote its clinical use.",

Glycyrrhizae Radix has anti-inflammatory, antiviral, and antitumor functions [12] . Herba Ephedrae has antioxidant and antiviral functions [13] , and Polygoni Cuspidati Rhizoma has antibacterial, antiviral, and antitumor functions [14, 15] . From the literature, chlorogenic acid, an active component of Flos Lonicerae Japonicae, has shown an inhibitory effect on virus replication [16] . The main component of Glycyrrhizae Radix, glycyrrhizin, may protect mice exposed to a lethal amount of influenza virus through the stimulation of IFN-\u03b3 production by T cells and has been reported to inhibit influenza A virus uptake into the cell [17] . Glycyrrhizin concentrations that inhibited H5N1induced proinflammatory gene expression did not affect nat-ural killer cells' cytolytic activity [18] . Furthermore, emodin, an active component of Polygoni Cuspidati Rhizoma, inhibits the replication of influenza virus H1N1 in A549 cells [19] . So, we hypothesize that chlorogenic acid, glycyrrhizin, and emodin may be the active components of YHPG against the influenza virus. However, YHPG is composed of many traditional Chinese medicines and has more complex components. Additional investigations must identify the possible anti-influenza bioactive components in YHPG. Based on preliminary evidence, this study further confirmed that YHPG, within the effective concentration range, has a marked therapeutic effect on the influenza virus, effectively reducing CPE and has protective effects on MDCK cells after influenza virus infection. Simultaneously, we found that the main antiviral components of YHPG were ephedrine hydrochloride, pseudoephedrine hydrochloride, chlorogenic acid, and emodin. ",

            "text": "There are two major antiviral immune pathways mediated by TLRs: MyD88-dependent and MyD88-independent pathways. TLR7 signaling belongs to the MyD88-dependent pathway and is located in the inner body membrane, which can identify the virus single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) [22] . Upon pathogen infection, TLR7 interacts with its corresponding ligands, and the intracellular Toll/interleukin-1 receptor homology (TIR) domain of activated TLR7 binds to and interacts with the carboxyl-terminus of MyD88 [23] . Activated MyD88 then induces the phosphorylation of members of the interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase (IRAK) family to activate TRAF6 and transmit the signal to MAPK, JNK, and p65 NF-\u03baB [24] , ultimately resulting in the secretion of many types of immune-associated cytokines and chemokines for the antiviral response, such as IFN-\u03b2 and IL-6 [25, 26] . Previous studies have found that the expression of TLR7 was significantly upregulated in immune cells infected with the influenza A virus [27] . Furthermore, TLR7 signaling also induced downstream proinflammatory cytokines [28] . MyD88 is essential for proinflammatory cytokine production [29] and optimal protection against various pathogens, including viruses [30, 31] . TRAF6 has been identified as a signal transducer, resulting in the production of cytokines [32] . JNK is activated during many viral infections [33] and is required for polarized differentiation of T helper cells into Th1 cells [34] . T cell receptor-activated p38\u03b1 and p38\u03b2 MAPK are important and redundant positive regulators of T cell proliferation and inflammatory autoimmunity [35] . The activation of NF-\u03baB, as a marker of the proliferation of influenza virus in host cells [36] , is also a key regulator of gene expression of inflammatory factors and plays an important role in the pathogenesis of antiinfluenza virus infection [37] .",
