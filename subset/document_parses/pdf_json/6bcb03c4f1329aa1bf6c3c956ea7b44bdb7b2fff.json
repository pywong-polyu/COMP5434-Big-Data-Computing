The growing impact of emerging variants of concern increases the urgency for development of effective interventions. Since ACE2 is the critical SARS-CoV-2 receptor and all tested variants bind to ACE2, some even at much increased affinity (see accompanying paper), we hypothesized that aerosol administration of clinical grade soluble human recombinant ACE2 (APN01) will neutralize SARS-CoV-2 in the airways, limit spread of infection in the lung and mitigate lung damage caused by deregulated signaling in the renin-angiotensin (RAS) and Kinin pathways. Here we show that intranasal administration of APN01 in a mouse model of SARS-CoV-2 infection dramatically reduced weight loss and prevented animal death.",

Twice daily aerosol administration for two weeks at the maximum feasible concentration revealed no notable toxicities. Based on these results, a Phase I clinical trial in healthy volunteers can now be initiated, with subsequent Phase II testing in individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection.

A series of publications in early 2020 defined the molecular details regarding structural interactions between the receptor binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 and the ACE2 receptor (3) (4) (5) (6) . Blocking the Spike-ACE2 interaction provided a potential anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapeutic strategy and is the basis for virtually all successful vaccine designs (7) . Proteins or peptides interacting with either of the binding partners have therapeutic potential and some very high affinity binders have been reported (8) . Likewise, engineered antibodies can inhibit the Spike-ACE2 interaction, and several have received Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) as single agents or combinations from the FDA and EMA as systemic therapeutics (9) (10) (11) . Recently, the EUA of a monoclonal antibody directed to the Spike protein was revoked for use as a single agent because of reduced activity against emerging viral variants (12) . Use of recombinant ACE2 may prove to be a universal and robust therapeutic intervention, since all studied emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants continue to use ACE2 as the primary receptor. Importantly, although multiple entry receptors have been proposed, recent data have unequivocally shown that ACE2 is the essential SARS-CoV-2 receptor in vivo (13) .",

Mutations detected in variants of concern and variants of interest cluster in the viral Spike protein and particularly in the receptor binding domain. Although these variants can in part escape neutralization by vaccines, convalescent plasma, and multiple therapeutic antibodies, all of these variants continue to use ACE2 as primary receptor. Importantly, our recent data for the first time also show that ACE2 deficient mice no longer exhibit signs of COVID-19 in our mouse adapted SARS-CoV-2 maVie16 infection model (18) , demonstrating that ACE2 is essential for SARS as well as SARS-CoV-2 infections. The mouse adapted SARS-CoV-2 maVie16 strain bears two key mutations in the RBD to allow for mouse ACE2 receptor binding but remains susceptible to APN01. Thus, our novel and severe mouse COVID-19 model allowed us to assess the therapeutic activity of APN01 directly administered to the respiratory tree. Indeed, treatment with APN01 at the time of infection prevented any COVID-19 pathologies (lung), clinical symptoms (weight loss) and, importantly, completely protected from death. Similarly, intranasal therapy with murine ACE2, produced in exactly the same manner as APN01, completely prevented the SARS-CoV-2 maVie16 infection and all mice remained healthy (13), consistent with the APN01 studies. Since in contrast to therapeutic MoAbs or natural Abs (22, 23) no virus escape mutants should occur in binding to ACE2, APN01 could be used as an inhalable universal therapy against all current and future SARS-CoV-2 variants. The results presented here support the high therapeutic potential and feasibility of 105 and is also made available for use under a CC0 license.",

APN01 samples recovered from the nebulization runs were diluted in assay buffer to 1.0 \u00b5g/ml, as quantified with hACE2 ELISA measurements. Further dilution in assay buffer was conducted to yield 100 ng/ml, 50 ng/ml, and 25 ng/ml solutions at volumes of 1 ml each.

HPLC quantitation of APN01 on filters. The aerosol mass concentration in each oronasal inhalation exposure system was determined by collecting the aerosol on glass-fiber filters. Samples were collected at a constant flow rate equal to the port flow of the delivery tube, and the total volume of air samples was measured by a dry-gas meter. One aerosol sample per dose level was collected during each exposure. Filter samples were extracted with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and stored refrigerated (approximately 4\u00b0C). Filter samples were analyzed for levels of APN01 using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with UV wavelength detection according to a validated method. During method validation, quality control (QC) samples prepared in PBS at target APN01 concentrations of 49 and 245 \u03bcg/mL were demonstrated to be stable for at least 22 days when stored refrigerated (111% and 104% of the original value, respectively) and for at least 2 days when stored at room temperature (111% and 103% of the original value, respectively).

Ten-week-old BALB/c mice (Charles River) received daily intranasal treatments with 100 \u00b5g APN01 or the respective dilution of vehicle in endotoxin-free PBS (Gibco). The first dose was given as a mix with 1 x 10 5 TCID50 of maVie16, a mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2 virus (18), in 50 \u00b5l, the remaining doses were administered in 40 \u00b5l endotoxin-free PBS to isoflurane-anesthetized animals. All experiments involving SARS-CoV-2 or its derivatives were performed in Biosafety Level 3 (BSL-3) facilities at the Medical University of Vienna and performed after approval by the institutional review board of the Austrian Ministry of Sciences (BMBWF-2020-0.253.770) and in accordance with the directives of the EU. Recovery of aerosolized APN01. An adaptor was connected to the mouthpiece port of the PARI LC PLUS nebulizer, secured to a ring stand, to route the aerosol into a custom fabricated condenser consisting of a 4L polypropylene graduated cylinder lined with downward-spiraling C-Flex tubing (Cole Palmer). The cylinder was filled with an ice water bath and the exit tubing was then fed through a hole into a 50 mL conical collection tube. The nebulizer was connected to a PARI Vios PRO Compressor according to the manufacturer's instructions. For Trials 1-2, APN01 (lot ACE20620-B) was diluted to a volume of 4 ml at 2.5 mg/ml, transferred to the nebulizer cup, and nebulized for 24 min. For Trials 3-4, APN01 was diluted to a volume of 4 ml at 0.1 mg/ml and nebulized for 24 min. This resulted in a range of recovery from all trials of 0.570-1.420 ml APN01 the collection tube, corresponding to 15.4-38.4% of the starting volume. Three samples were tested: diluted APN01 sample before addition to the nebulizer cup (Control), Unnebulized sample remainder in the nebulizer cup (Pre), and sample obtained from the collection tube after condensation (Post).

Plates were sealed with adhesive plate seals and incubated overnight at 4 \u00baC, then washed 3X with wash buffer (1X PBS + 0.05% Tween 20). Plates were blocked with blocking buffer (1X PBS + 1% BSA), sealed, and incubated for 1 h at r.t. APN01 samples recovered from the nebulization runs were diluted in blocking buffer to 27 \u00b5g/ml, as quantified with hACE2 ELISA measurements. Further dilutions were conducted using blocking buffer for a seven-point standard curve. All 7 standards and a blank were added to the ELISA plate in triplicate. Plates were covered and incubated for 1 h at r.t., then washed 5X with wash buffer. Biotinylated goat anti-human ACE2 (R&D Systems) diluted in blocking buffer was added to plates at 0.4 \u00b5g/ml followed by a 1 h incubation at r.t. Plates were washed 5X with wash buffer. Streptavidin-HRP (Thermo-Fisher Scientific) diluted in blocking buffer was added to plates at 0.1 \u00b5g/mL followed by a 30 min incubation at r.t., then washed 3X with wash buffer. TMB substrate solution (SeraCare) was added followed by a 6 min incubation in the dark at r.t. Finally, stop solution 1 M H2SO4 (J.T. Baker, Inc.) was added and plates were gently shaken for 5 s to mix and then absorbance (O.D.) was measured at 450/620 nm on a SpectraMax M5 (Molecular Devices) instrument and data were processed by SoftMax Pro 6.4 software (Molecular Devices).
