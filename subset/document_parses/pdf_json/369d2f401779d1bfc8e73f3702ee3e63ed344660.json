            "text": "SARS-CoV-2 infection results in viral burden in the upper and lower respiratory tract, enabling transmission and often leading to substantial lung pathology. Delivering the antiviral treatment directly to the lungs has the potential to improve lung bioavailability and dosing efficiency. As the SARS-CoV-2 Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) of the Spike (S) is increasingly deemed to be a clinically validated target, RBD-specific B cells were isolated from patients following SARS-CoV-2 infection to derive a panel of fully human monoclonal antibodies (hmAbs) that potently neutralize SARS-CoV-2. The most potent hmAb, 1212C2 was derived from an IgM memory B cell, has high affinity for SARS-CoV-2 RBD which enables its direct inhibition of RBD binding to ACE2. The 1212C2 hmAb exhibits in vivo prophylactic and therapeutic activity against SARS-CoV-2 in hamsters when delivered intraperitoneally, achieving a meaningful reduction in upper and lower respiratory viral burden and lung pathology. Furthermore, liquid nebulized inhale treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infected hamsters with as low as 0.6 mg/kg of inhaled dose, corresponding to approximately 0.03 mg/kg of lung deposited dose, mediated a reduction in respiratory viral burden that is below the detection limit, and mitigated lung pathology. The therapeutic efficacy achieved at an exceedingly low-dose of inhaled 1212C2 supports the rationale for local lung delivery and achieving dose-sparing benefits as compared to the conventional parenteral route of administration. Taken together, these results warrant an accelerated clinical development of 1212C2 hmAb formulated and delivered via inhalation for the prevention and treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection.",

It is expected that new infections will continue for many more months, and the virus will persist endemically for years. Although severe infections and deaths have been reported in all ages and demographics, those over 65 years old and those with pre-existing conditions are at highest risk for death (1-5). Thus far, no drug or vaccine has been approved by the FDA for the treatment or prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Moreover in the US, the number of COVID-19 patients that are hospitalized represent a small fraction (~10%) of the active cases, which implies that the vast majority of COVID-19 symptomatic patients are not hospitalized and need treatment (6). Therefore, facilitating greater treatment coverage will be of importance to control transmissibility and healthcare burden.",

Emerging results in humans treated with convalescent plasma with high titer NAbs suggest therapeutic activity (13, 14) . The primary target for SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies is the Receptor Binding Domain (RBD), whereby antibodies are expected to inhibit the binding of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike (S) protein to the host Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2), preventing viral attachment.",

Moreover, when delivered as inhaled liquid aerosols using a commercially available nebulizer, 1212C2 mediated eradication of lung viral load at a substantially higher dosing efficiency than the parenteral route of administration. The combination of a potent SARS-CoV-2 mAb and inhaled, local lung delivery using widely available nebulizers could provide for a promising treatment option.",

The process of entry into a susceptible host cell is an important determinant of infectivity and pathogenesis of viruses, including coronaviruses (18, 19) . SARS-CoV-2 relies on the ability of its S glycoprotein to bind to the ACE2 receptor through its RBD driving a conformational change that culminates in the fusion of the viral envelope with the host cell membrane, and cell entry (20) . The hmAbs were tested for neutralization of live SARS-CoV-2 using a virus plaque reduction microneutralization (PRMNT) assay we previously described (21) , with the hmAb and virus pre-incubated prior to culture with susceptible Vero E6 cells (pre-treatment) or allowing virus adsorption to Vero E6 cells to occur for 1 hour prior to addition of the hmAb (post-treatment). This gives an opportunity for the virus to initiate viral entry by binding to the cell surface receptor, potentially distinguishing the hmAb's ability to preferentially block later steps of virus entry into the cell or by inhibiting the cell-to-cell spread of virus progeny. The panel of hmAbs neutralized SARS-CoV-2 in both pre-and post-treatment conditions at NT 50 of 1 \u03bcg/ml or less, with 1212F5, 1212C2, and 1213H7 exhibiting the highest potency, with NT 50 of 100 ng/ml or less (Fig 2A) . The hmAb 1215D1 was more effective in neutralizing in post-treatment (NT 50 = 59 ng/ml) compared to pre-treatment (NT 50 = 226 ng/ml)). The 1212C2 hmAb was particularly potent (pre NT 50 = 45 ng/ml, post NT 50 = 32 ng/ml) (Fig 2B) . Testing of 1212C2 in a SARS-CoV-2 VSV vectored pseudovirus assay confirmed its potent neutralizing activity (NT 50 = 1.9 ng/ml) that was similar to REGN10987 and CB6/JS016 (Supplemental Table 1 ).",

The most potent hmAbs, 1212C2 and 1212F5 were both isolated from IgM+ B cells, belong to the same clonal lineage that utilizes the VH1-2 heavy chain gene, and exhibited modest somatic hypermutation, with 1212C2 further mutated from germline compared to 1212F5 (8.2% vs 6.1% amino acid VH) ( Table 1) . Most of the hmAbs were isolated from IgG1 expressing B cells, while 1215D1 and 1212C8 were isolated from IgA expressing B cells. All hmAbs exhibited somatic hypermutation (2.0%-9.1% VH) suggesting they arose from multiple rounds of germinal center reactions. VH3-66 and Vk1-9 gene usage was dominant among the hmAbs. Targeted VH-deep sequencing of the 1212C2/1212F5 clonal lineage from contemporary peripheral blood B cells identified numerous members (Fig 3) . SPR epitope mapping was performed and used to cluster the hmAbs into five major epitopes (A-E, Fig 4) . With one exception, all isolated hmAbs are part of the A epitope, that includes 1212C2. Thus, 1212C2 efficiently blocked all hmAbs from binding to RBD, except 1215B11 (E epitope), whose epitope overlaps with CR0322. Within the footprint of the A epitope there are several sub-epitopes. In particular, we highlight hmAbs 1207B4/1215D1 (B-epitope) and 1213H7 (C-epitope) that exhibit essentially no overlap with one another, based on their ability to simultaneously bind RBD at greater than 90% of their expected binding levels.",

In contrast at 2 dpi, hamsters that received 1212C2 already started to exhibit meaningful viral load reduction in their nasal turbinate and lungs (Fig 5A) . At 4 dpi virus was detected in the nasal turbinates and lungs of all hamsters in the PBS and isotype control groups, although an overall decrease compared to 2 dpi, consistent with the viral dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 infection in hamsters (22) . In comparison to the control groups at 4 dpi, prophylactically treated 1212C2 hamsters exhibited eradication of viral loads in the nasal turbinates and lungs in 3 of 4 animals. Consistent with the viral load reduction, 1212C2 treated animals exhibited significantly less lung pathology compared to the PBS treated group at 2 dpi and 4dpi, with this reduction also reaching significance compared to the isotype control group at 4 dpi (Fig 5C) . There was ~80% reduction in lung pathology at 4 dpi when 1212C2 was given prophylactically. 1206D1 hmAb exhibited modest activity, noted by 50% of hamsters having no detectable virus in the nasal turbinate, and all 1206D1 hamsters having detectable virus in the lungs, although trending to lower titers compared to PBS and isotype control groups. These in vivo results are consistent with the lower in vitro viral neutralization activity of 1206D1 in comparison to 1212C2 (Fig 2A) .",

Nevertheless, such lung deposited (BAL) dose is still substantially higher at both time points than the BAL concentration achieved with the IP route. A higher lung deposited dose afforded by the inhaled route demonstrates higher delivery efficiency to the lungs than the IP route.

Therefore, inhaled 1212C2 has the potential to profoundly facilitate dose-sparing and treatment coverage compared to conventional parenteral administration.

Delivery of inhaled hmAb in hamsters. Therapeutic mAbs are typically delivered systemically through intravenous infusion or intramuscular injection. Such delivery typically results in less than 0.1% of the injected dose in the lung epithelial lining fluid at Cmax, thus highly inefficient in achieving optimal concentrations in the respiratory tract for the protection or treatment of respiratory infections, such as SARS-CoV-2 (23). To evaluate the efficiency of lung delivered dosing and clearance of an IgG1 hmAb when delivered as an IP bolus dose as compared to an inhaled nebulized aerosol, hamsters were administered with the non-specific IgG used in the challenge studies and the serum and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) concentrations were analyzed at 30 minutes and 42 hours post-dosing (Supplemental",

            "text": ", the lung deposited dose in hamsters is approximately 1.7% of the inhaled dose. This implies that elimination of lung viral burden was achieved at day 4 post-infection with a lung dose of 0.01 mg/kg. Further, if the relevant translation between species to achieve an efficacious dose is a normalization based on a lung-deposited dose per kilogram of lung weight, then, combined with the expectation that the at least 50% of the inhaled dose from a similar commercial nebulizer would be deposited in the lung of a human, the human equivalent efficacious inhaled dose would be 0.03 mg per kg body weight (assumptions: 110g hamster with 1 gram lung weight; 70 kg human with 1000g lung weight).DiscussionThe SARS-CoV-2 global pandemic continues without clear evidence yet of an effective vaccine to prevent infection or optimal targeted intervention to treat the infection. Our results clearly demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 infection can result in memory B cells encoding high affinity, high potency NAbs specific for the RBD. The 1212C2 hmAb is able to significantly reduce viral burden in SARS-CoV-2 infected hamsters when used either prophylactically or therapeutically. The in vitro affinity compared favorably to and the neutralization activity of 1212C2 was similar to hmAbs that are in late stage clinical trials to treat SARS-CoV-2, suggesting that 1212C2.The resulting panel of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing hmAbs indicate that RBD-specific IgG, IgA, and IgM memory B cells develop after infection, however, exhibit only modest somatic hypermutation, which is consistent with an acute primary immune response.Several hmAbs, including 1212C2, 1212F5, 1213H7, and 1212F2 despite only modest somatic hypermutation (4.1-8.2% VH) have remarkably high affinity for SARS-CoV-2 RBD (104-1180 pM KD) and potent neutralization (<200 ng/ml NT 50 ). The frequent usage of VH3-66 and Vk1-9 among the hmAbs may represent preferential RBD specificity among those germline genes. 1212C2 and 1212F5, which are members of the same clonal lineage, were isolated from IgM memory B cells, and utilize the VH1-2 heavy chain gene. VH1-2 usage is a common feature of other antibodies targeting viral glycoproteins, including HIV envelope(27)(28)(29). VH1-2 usage is more pronounced among marginal zone B cells than naive B cells or switched memory B cells and increased among splenic marginal zone B cell lymphoma(30)(31)(32)(33). This may indicate that the 1212C2 lineage arose from a marginal zone B cell response.1212C2 has higher affinity (KD =104 pM) for SARS-CoV-2 RBD compared to 1212F5 (KD =841 pM) which is consistent with its further somatic hypermutation. Additional lineage members were identified, with greater somatic hypermutation, and may be used to guide rational improvement of 1212C2 affinity, neutralization, and ultimate efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 infection.The resulting hmAbs all neutralized SARS-CoV-2 at NT 50 of 1 \u03bcg/ml or less, indicating their utility for investigating the mechanisms and epitopes mediating SARS-CoV-2 RBD targeted anti-viral activity. Although there was overall consistency that the hmAbs neutralized SARS-CoV-2 either when pre-incubated with the virus (pre-treatment) or after the cells were infected with the virus for 1 h (post-treatment), particularly 1212C2, 1212F5, and 12137 potently neutralized (NT 50 <100 ng/ml) SARS-CoV-2 in both conditions, discordance was noted.1206D1, which was tested in vivo, was approximately 2-fold less effective neutralizing in post-treatment than pre-treatment, which may contribute to its limited in vivo activity. In contrast, 1215D1, which had the highest affinity for RBD (KD = 73 pM) is approximately 5-fold more effective in neutralizing in post-treatment than pre-treatment. It is expected that the post-treatment neutralization assay may identify antibodies that are better able to mitigate cell-to-cell virus spreading, including antibodies targeting the fusiogenic activity of the S2 domain.",

Vero E6 cells (96well plate format, 4 x 10 4 cells/well, quadruplicate) were infected with virus-hmAb or virus-serum (control well) mixture for virus adsorption for 1h, followed by changing media with post-infection media containing 2% FBS and 1% Avicel. For post-treatment, Vero E6 cells (96-well plate format, 4 x 10 4 cells/well, quadruplicate) were infected with 100-200 PFU/well of SARS-CoV-2.

A non-linear regression curve fit analysis over the dilution curve can be performed using GraphPad Prism to calculate NT 50. Mock-infected cells and viruses in the absence of hmAb were used as internal controls. hmAbs were also tested using a SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein pseudotyped virus (PsV) containing the gene for firefly luciferase. Virus neutralization can be measured by the reduction of luciferase expression. VeroE6/TMPRSS2 cells were seeded at 2 x 10 4 cells/well in opaque plates (Greiner 655083).

Two rounds of PCRs were performed to generate the libraries with either global (VH1 -VH6) or individual VH targeted forward primers as previously described(27,39) with the modifications adapted for Illumina Nextera approach. The final PCR products were gel extracted (QIAQuick, Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and further purified using the ProNex sizeselective purification system (Promega) to select products between 500-700 bp range.Libraries were submitted to the Heflin Center for Genomic Sciences at the University of Alabama at Birmingham where DNA quantification was made by qPCR and sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq system (Illumina, Inc., CA, USA) using 2 \u00d7 300 bp paired-end kits (Illumina MiSeq Reagent Kit v3).
