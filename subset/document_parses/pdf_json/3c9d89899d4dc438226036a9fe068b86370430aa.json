            "text": "Four centuries ago, science broke his ancestral link with philosophy, adopting Galilei's experimental method. However, still in 1669 Bernardino Ramazzini got his degrees in Medicine and Philosophy, both fields of study belonging to the same metaphysical realm. Medicine did not move to the scientific playground until the second half of the 19th century, when Claude Bernard adopted an experimental approach for his physiological studies, describing rigorous conditions under which any experiment must be reproducible. Despite elapsing time and the tremendous milestones achieved thanks to scientific principles, metaphysic and anti-scientific attitudes and thoughts persist in every field of knowledge, including Medicine. Unfortunately, in Medicine, particularly in Occupational Medicine, our understanding is mostly based on observation of diseases occurring because nature and occupational settings operate in ways that researchers cannot control. Experience, rather than experiments, is the source of knowledge. A collective experience based on individual observations is difficult to build up in a reproducible way. Yet, like other medical disciplines, Occupational Medicine increasingly needs to found professional practice on a solid scientific ground that guarantees evidence and appropriateness for its varied activities.",

They can be applied only to an ideal subject with average values of all variables under study, such as potential confounders included in the regression models. Second, epidemiology's observational nature makes it susceptible to systematic error, and any extrapolation to individuals would mirror the validity of the initial results. Quantitative bias analysis has been proposed to assess the likelihood, direction, and magnitude of bias, but this has not yet become part of epidemiology's practice. Finally, the external validity of results (i.e., their application to individuals and populations other than those included in the underlying studies) needs to be addressed, including population-based factors, such as heterogeneity in exposure or disease circumstances, and individual-based factors, such as the interaction of the risk factors of interest with other determinants of the disease. Similar considerations are valid also to the application of clinical trials results to individual patients, although in these studies, sources of systematic error are better controlled (1) .",

            "text": "Over the last few decades, several groups and associations tried to set up a framework to share criteria to extract and review knowledge from epidemiological studies. Systematic Reviews have been introduced to improve the synthesis of available evidence and reduce bias in the conclusions about a body of evidence. Nowadays, Systematic Review is an established method also in the Occupational Safety and Health (OSH) field. The Cochrane Work Review Group facilitates authors to produce Cochrane reviews of intervention topics in this area. A variety of guidelines used Cochrane Work reviews for underpinning their recommendations. Due to the reproducibility of the comprehensive search of systematic reviews, it turned out that such an approach can be powerful in changing beliefs. For example, studies published in the eighties advocated the use of back schools. Nowadays, we know that the total body of evidence has changed the traditional view that lifting techniques could prevent back pain. 'Sitting is the new smoking' is an eye-catching nicely alliterating motto, but it is of course highly overstated. The findings of a Cochrane review of the effects of interventions to decrease sitting at work showed that sitting time can be reduced by a bit less than two hours per day by providing sit-stand desks plus education. However, it is unclear if this is sufficient to counter the effects of sitting. A wealth of evidence on OSH interventions has been collected by international collaboration in the Cochrane Work Review Group (2) .",

One such condition is idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), a rare lung disease of unknown origin that rapidly leads to death. The disease progression rate varies from one individual to another and is still difficult to predict, though its prognosis is poor, with a median survival of three to five years after diagnosis, without curative therapies other than lung transplantation. The factors leading to disease onset and progression are not yet completely known. The current disease paradigm is that sustained alveolar epithelial micro-injury caused by environmental triggers (e.g., cigarette smoke, particulate dust, viral infections or lung microbial composition) leads to alveolar damage resulting in fibrosis in genetically susceptible individuals. Numerous epidemiological studies and case reports have shown that occupational factors contribute to the risk of developing IPF. In this perspective, the current understanding of the pathophysiology of IPF and the importance of occupational factors in the pathogenesis and prognosis of the disease was reviewed to identify and eliminate occult exposure, which may represent a novel treatment approach in patients with IPF (4).",

Only one out of 14 cases of restrictive deficit diagnosed based on total body plethysmography values was also identified using spirometry.

However, their use is still limited to research projects. Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) are chronic diseases that are by far the leading cause of death globally. Together with social, economic, and demographic factors, many occupational hazards have been associated with NCDs development. Genetic susceptibility or environmental exposures alone are not usually sufficient to explain the pathogenesis of NCDs. Still, they can be integrated into a more complex scenario that can result in pathological phenotypes. Epigenetics is a crucial component of this scenario. Its changes are related to specific exposures, potentially displaying the effects of the environment on the genome, filling the gap between the genetic asset and environment in explaining disease development. To date, the most promising biomarkers have been assessed in occupational cohorts and case/control studies. They include DNA methylation, histone modifications, microRNA expression, extracellular vesicles, telomere length, and mitochondrial alterations (6) .",

In this new scenario, a thorough knowledge of exposure levels is needed to assess chemical risks in environmental and occupational settings. Biological monitoring is among the most useful tools for assessing exposure. However, to provide adequate guidance in implementing risk management measures, biomonitoring results need to be compared with appropriate references. Reference values (RVs) provide useful information for a correct interpretation of toxicological data, by comparing them with biomonitoring results. In Public Health, this may enable us to identify potential sources of exposure, define the principal and most frequently exploited routes of exposure, and outline chemical absorption. Similarly, in Occupational Medicine, RVs can be used to give meaning to biomonitoring editorial 5 findings, especially when a biological limit value is not available for the chemical in question. Furthermore, these values are a tool for classifying as occupational any otherwise environmental exposure to chemical carcinogens. Therefore, by integrating reference values in an appropriate and complete system of guide values that includes action levels and biological limit values, we could obtain an adequate assessment of exposure and a better understanding of toxicological data (7) .",

Although innovative \"omic\" technologies supported the application of personalised Medicine in clinical, oncological, and pharmacological settings, its roles in occupational health practice and research are still in a developing phase. Occupational personalised approaches have been currently applied in experimental settings and in conditions of unpredictable risks, e.g., war missions and space flights, where it is essential to avoid disease manifestations and therapy failure. However, a debate is necessary regarding whether personalised Medicine is even more critical to support a redefinition of the risk assessment processes considering the complex interaction between occupational and individual factors. Indeed, \"omic\" techniques can help understand the xenobiotics' hazardous properties, dose-response relationships through a more in-depth elucidation of the exposure-disease pathways and internal doses of exposure. Overall, this may guide the adoption/implementation of primary preventive measures protective for the vast majority of the population, including most susceptible subgroups. However, personalised Medicine into occupational health requires overcoming some practical, ethical, legal, economic, and socio-political issues, particularly concerning privacy protection and the risk of discrimination that the workers may experience. In this scenario, the concerted action of academic, industry, governmental, and stakeholder representatives should be encouraged to improve research aimed to guide effective and sustainable implementation of personalised Medicine in occupational health fields (11) .",

LTBI diagnostic test is not available to directly identify live MT infection in humans. The diagnosis of LTBI is indirect and relies on detecting an immune response against MT antigens, assuming that the immune response has developed after contact with the biological agent. Tuberculin skin test (TST) and interferon-gamma release assays (IGRAs) are the main diagnostic tools for LTBI; however, both present strengths and limitations.
