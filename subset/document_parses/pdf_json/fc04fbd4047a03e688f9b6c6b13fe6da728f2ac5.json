As of February 2021, the virus has infected over 100 million people and caused upwards of 2.4 million deaths. 1 A vaccine provides a powerful tool to prevent illness, death and transmission, and initiate the process of recovery. To this end, several vaccines are in development, with multiple approved and distributed over the last few months. 2 The COVID-19 Vaccines Global Access Facility (COVAX) provides participating countries an opportunity to secure early access to a vaccine. 3 Led by Gavi, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) and the WHO, it was designed to reduce the risk of 'vaccine nationalism' and grant access to countries who do not have the fiscal or political means to secure bilateral or multilateral agreements with vaccine manufacturers. Moreover, the facility increases the efficiency of resources spent on vaccine development by pooling and channelling funds to the most promising candidates. An advance market commitment was arranged through funding from overseas development assistance, private donors and foundations to finance the manufacturing and distribution of vaccines for lowincome and middle-income countries (LMICs). 3 COVAX represents an enormous feat in international diplomacy, although its success in execution is yet to be determined.",

In phase 1, countries receive vaccine doses in equal proportion, to cover up to 20% of their total population, with an interim target of 3%. Only in phase 2 (i.e., after all countries have covered 20% of their total), does the secretariat propose a targeted distribution based on the burden of COVID-19 in the country and its health system capacity. 3 Ethicists have argued this does not recognise the significant differences in health outcomes and access to vaccines between countries. 4 They explain a more morally justifiable approach is to allocate vaccines based on need from the start, and have accordingly proposed a framework to facilitate targeted distribution ('The Fair Priority Model'). 4 Primarily driven by values of equal moral concern, priority to the worst-off and harm minimisation, they propose a distribution in three phases: in phase 1 the allocation would seek to minimise premature deaths, phase 2 would seek to reduce social and economic harm and phase 3 would target elimination of community transmission.",

It is difficult to approximate the number of additional lives saved without formal Current controversy epidemiological modelling, but one could confidently predict the number of deaths averted with a strategic allocation would be an order of magnitude higher given: \u25ba An individual living in Brazil, Bolivia or Peru is at least 10 times more likely to die from COVID-19 than an individual living in Australia, New Zealand or South Korea. 8 \u25ba Over 35% worldwide deaths secondary to COVID-19 originate from Brazil, the USA and India 8 (see figure 1 ). \u25ba In the first week of March 2021, India averaged over 15, 752 new cases, in comparison to China who reported less than 30 new cases. 8 Building on this further, we could crudely estimate after the first round of vaccine distribution, at least 200 more deaths a day would be averted in Brazil compared with New Zealand, assuming the first distribution would avert 50% of daily deaths within a country. 8 COVID-19 has impacted some countries significantly more in other respects of well-being. Recent data has indicated the poverty headcount in India for instance is projected to reach over 10 million due to the pandemic. 9 The economic downturn has led to a sharp rise in food insecurity with researchers finding a 38% increase in adults missing meals and 69% increase in children missing meals across households in rural Kenya. 10 It is estimated the economic decline will persist as long as the pandemic is not under control. 9 While health or well-being maximisation is not an explicit value that SAGE appears to endorse, ethicists nearly unanimously agree that it should be considered in any health-related resource allocation decision making. 11 It is frequently used within other health contexts, with many countries publicly funding health interventions based on the number of quality-adjusted life years they save, 12 13 and multilateral institutions such as Gavi, who place significant weight on health maximisation when deciding which vaccines to prioritise. 14 ",

            "text": "The intuition for a targeted allocation could also be grounded in principles of fairness and justice. Put another way, a distribution based on equity, which incorporates judgements based on what is fair and just, 15 would be more morally justifiable compared with an equal distribution. Unlike health maximisation, the SAGE values endorse equity and explain a distribution should take into account need-particularly the need of individuals more likely to be hospitalised and suffer fatal outcomes, and the need of LMICs with comparatively weak health systems and social safety nets. 6 We ultimately care about need in public health because we believe some people, or in this case, some countries would benefit from additional support to achieve equal health outcomes. 15 We know, however, striving for equal health outcomes, is not possible in all circumstances particularly when biological and genetic variations play a large role in disparities. In an attempt to better define the outcomes we should seek to equalise, Whitehead proposed equal outcomes should be sought insofar differences or variations in outcomes are unnecessary and avoidable, in addition to being unfair or unjust. 6 There is of course much debate on which inequalities meet this criteria but such scaffolding can facilitate more effective enquiry. One guide to determining what may constitute an unfair or unjust inequality, Whitehead explains, involves considering the degree of choice involved in the factors resulting in that inequality. While there is debate about the degree of choice involved in the consumption of harmful products such as tobacco, it is clear individuals born in poverty or born in countries with a high burden of disease had little choice for their living and working conditions, which ultimately had and will continue to have a large influence on their COVID-19 outcomes. With further application of Whitehead's definition, we can see differences in health outcomes between countries are rectifiable with a greater allocation of vaccines to countries with a higher burden. However, one may argue the inequalities between countries may be considered necessary and something that should not be immediately fixed. They may reason that countries may choose not to partake in the facility if they consider themselves disadvantaged in the first stage, potentially leading to COVAX ceasing to exist if the WHO sought to address the inequality immediately by proposing a targeted distribution. We explore this possibility and its implication in the last section.",

            "text": "Daniels further characterises the health inequalities that may be viewed as unjust by linking health inequalities to a Rawlsian account of distributive justice. 7 Rawls argues if we were to negotiate among ourselves behind a 'veil of ignorance' we would agree a fair society would be a society which protects basic liberties, provides equality of opportunity and limits inequalities to those that provide benefits to the worst-off. 16 Daniels claims health must be given special moral importance because it protects the range of opportunities available to us. 7 He extends his analysis to explain health inequalities are unjust when they evolve from an unequal distribution of the social determinants of health, or a distribution that does not align with Rawl's principles of justice. In the context of COVAX, this could point to LMICs given extra priority, as their health losses are amplified because a higher proportion of individuals did not have their basic needs met prior to the pandemic. However, Daniels stopped short from claiming Rawl's principles of justice could be applied in resource allocation contexts, conceding the principles were indeterminate in resolving disputes regarding the aggregation which best protects fair equality of opportunity. 7 For example, it cannot tell us how much extra priority we should give the worse-off, if we can produce a much bigger improvement in health for those who are better off. He instead emphasised a fair process must take place, a form of procedural justice, to arrive at a reasonable decision. The process should include a deliberate search for mutually justifiable reasons for an allocation, publicity about the grounds for decisions and revisability of decisions in light of new evidence and arguments. The WHO secretariat appears to have met the first two criteria of Daniels conditions in their bid to determine a fair allocation, having set reasons for why they proposed an equal distribution and making their reasoning publicly available. 4 However, as others have highlighted, their reasons are unclear and at times, conflicting. 17 It remains to be seen if they change their decision in light of arguments and new evidence.",

In the Rawlsian account of distributive justice, the demandingness of reducing inequalities stems from the relationship between individuals and institutions within states, constituting a basic societal structure. 18 Rawls claims that to ensure these relationships are fair and just, the state must intervene to provide equal political liberties and opportunities among citizens. He argues the same rules would not apply in international contexts, as the same institutions do not exist. 18 Nagel further develops Rawl's position, by explaining justice primarily applies in the context of coercive institutions, given the state has the duty to minimise inequality because of the liberties it removes from its citizens so as to engage in largescale economic coordination. 19 Others disagree, either arguing the principles of justice do not depend on the existence of an institutional framework, or the institutions exist on the international scale, and are unfair and exploitative in their design. 20 21 Pogge, for example, explains multilateral institutions such as the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and World Trade Organization substantially influence the trajectory of nations, and consequently, must act in a way to promote global justice. 20 Based on this logic, WHO should have a similar mandate and the responsibility to ensure their technical advice is distributed in a way that is equitable.",

Perhaps this was part of the reason for why SAGE separated equity into national and global entities, 5 potentially recognising that some national partiality was justifiable. That then begs the question, to what degree does this partiality extend? Would it be enough for LMICs to not be required to contribute to the development and production of vaccines? Or as Emanuel et al propose, should countries forgo vaccinations if the reproduction number is below 1 4 ? Citizens of high-income countries (HIC) may certainly feel treated unfairly if their nation did not receive any vaccines during the first iteration of distribution, despite contributing to the development and distribution of vaccines, and have the capacity to benefit. On the other hand, the only mechanism for LICs with a high burden of COVID-19 may be the COVAX facility, as they may not have the means to attain vaccines in the market, ultimately receiving a much lower proportion of vaccines compared to countries that have been able to secure deals outside of the COVAX facility. It appears at this stage that the initial distribution will be significantly unequal due to the bilateral arrangements secured by HICs, and will not correlate (or worse, negatively correlate) with disease burden.",

We are sympathetic to the position Emanuel et al 4 took as we believe, there are too many lives at stake to justify an equal distribution of vaccinations on the claim that nations only have responsibility to correct inequalities within their territorial boundaries. However, we find this does not hold when we examine the political constraints. In an interview with a Vox journalist, the WHO's chief scientist Soumya Swaminathan was asked about why the secretariat has proposed an equal distribution and candidly explained 'There's a big, big risk that if you propose a very idealistic model, you may be left with nothing. 22 ' She referred to the 2009 swine influenza epidemic where most of the vaccine doses were bought by HICs. Taking into account the realities of a political economy, an equal distribution could then be justifiable from a well-being maximisation perspective as well, given the very real possibility of not attaining signatures to fund the COVAX facility. That is to say, a targeted distribution may lead to many more HICs refusing to sign up to the facility, which ultimately would reduce the number of vaccines that LMICs receive.",

We crudely estimate if an equal distribution was proposed, there was a 75% chance COVAX would attain the required signatories and corresponding funding to successfully operate. Based on modelling from researchers at Northeastern University, 23 this scenario is predicted to avert 61% of predicted deaths after allocation of 2 billion doses to cover 20% of all populations. On the contrary, if the multilateral arrangement did not eventuate, the same researchers predicted 33% of deaths would be averted based on a scenario in which HICs attain access to all vaccine doses when they are first produced. Given the disproportionate burden some nations are experiencing, we estimated a targeted scenario would avert 90% of deaths. However, because many HICs may not get access to the vaccine during the first allocation, we predicted the facility only had a 20% chance of materialising. Based on these sizeable assumptions, it follows the expected deaths averted in the equal distribution is higher than a targeted distribution.",

However, if anything, we felt we were generous with the probability attached to the success of the targeted allocation. In addition to the comments made by Swaminathan, our beliefs or predictions of the small possibility of HIC Current controversy signing a targeted allocation stem from observing their actions with regard to foreign aid, their actions so far in this pandemic and the WHO's previous allocation of technical assistance. To our knowledge, there has never been a scenario in which an HIC, or any country for that matter, that has been ready to forgo resources to other countries that they would benefit from themselves. Arguably all overseas development assistance directed to LMICs are resources HICs have an abundance of, or do not need given the different disease burdens. Further, some of the HIC with the most publically benevolent leaders have applied and been granted vaccines for COVAX's first iteration of distribution, despite having already made agreements with manufacturers to cover more than their population. Global leaders Jacinda Arden and Justin Trudeau have openly advocated for equality of access to vaccines and a distribution based on need. 24 If New Zealand were truly committed to a distribution based on need, it seems contradictory for them to apply for over 200,000 vaccines when they have suffered 5 COVID-19 deaths per million in total, compared with a country like Boliva who have had nearly 1000 deaths per million in total. 7 Such actions make us sceptical they would have contributed to a facility not allowing them to purchase vaccines on the first iteration of the distribution. Finally, we suspect the WHO, Gavi and CEPI had better information regarding what HICs would and would not sign-up to, as many negotiations would have occurred before an official proposal was released. We think they would have proposed an targeted proposal if it were feasible, given the WHO's approach to resource allocation in the past (eg, their distribution of technical assistance is guided by a country's GDP and life expectancy, 25 ) and commitment to global equity.",
