Nevertheless, products still must be produced, transported, and consumed in order to sustain humanity, and labor has revealed itself to be a critical resource in supply chain networks. In this paper, we construct the first multiperiod supply chain network model, which captures labor associated with the various supply chain network activities of production, transportation, storage over time, and distribution, and also includes link labor productivity enhancements that allow for investments in enhanced safety and health of the workers. We utilize a net present value (NPV) approach with the optimization model being formulated and solved as a variational inequality problem. We report the complete input and solution results for a series of numerical examples in terms of product flows, labor required, wages, as well as link labor productivity enhancements. We then further illustrate the relevance of the framework by conducting sensitivity analysis. We find that investing in link labor productivity can benefit workers also in terms of higher wages earned and the firm in terms of an increase in the optimal value of its objective function represented by the NPV, provided that consumers are aware of and responsive to such investments. This work adds to the literature on the integration and extension of concepts of operations research and economics in order to provide deeper insights into highly relevant aspects of supply chains during this time of their expanded importance.",

Firms are noting that keeping workers healthy and safe affects profits positively as well as a company's reputation, since the negative fallout from widely publicized illnesses at food processing plants, factories, distribution centers, and warehouses can have lasting effects. Similarly, with global warming and climate change, workers, as well as firms, are needing to adapt since higher temperatures are affecting the productivity of labor (see [12] ). De Lima et al. [13] note that labor supply and labor productivity are sensitive to increasing heat stress expected under climate change, especially in economic sectors that depend heavily on outdoor work; notably, agriculture [14, 15] . Being subjected to heat reduces the capability for physical activity in a wide range of work environments, and heat kills farm workers every year [16] .",

We allow for the operational costs to depend not only on the product flow but also on the productivity enhancements, since there may be maintenance costs encumbered over the time horizon. We also allow the demand price functions to depend not only on the product demand at the demand markets but also on the productivity enhancements. Hence, our optimization model captures that consumers may be more (or less) sensitive to investments by a company in labor productivity. This feature has some analogues in the sustainability literature where consumers may be willing to pay higher prices for products that encumber lower emissions, that is, are more \"green\" (see, e.g., [17] and the references therein). Examples of enhancements associated with labor productivity can include better temperature-controlled work environments, regular access to water and restroom breaks, provision of PPEs and other type of sanitary supplies, better lighting, ventilation, and work area design, among others. Here we are specifically interested in labor productivity enhancements of the \"hardware\" variety, rather than education and teaching of new skills, since the focus is on the pandemic healthcare disaster as well as the climate change one (see [18] ) and impacts on labor.",

            "text": "This work is the first to construct a supply chain network optimization model with labor and multiple time periods, with a focus on enhancing labor productivity, which is a topic of great current relevance in the pandemic and climate change, as well. There is only limited published work on the integration of labor as a primary resource into supply chain networks from a modeling perspective, and with an eye towards garnering insights that have emerged in the pandemic and are being further amplified because of climate change. Nagurney [19] constructed a supply chain network optimization model for perishable products, with a focus on food, in which there were bounds on the availability of labor on each link. This allowed for the quantification of the impacts of disruptions on labor availability in different supply chain network activities on product flows, consumer prices, and the profit of the firm. Nagurney [20] proposed another supply chain network optimization model with labor and three distinct sets of constraints, with the first consisting of upper bounds on labor availability on links; the second set consisting of an upper bound on labor availability on each tier of the supply chain network (production, transportation, storage, and distribution); and the third set of constraints consisting of a single labor bound in the supply chain network. Nagurney [21] then extended the latter paper to competing multiple firms using the Nash equilibrium (cf. [22, 23] ) for the model under the first set of constraints and generalized Nash equilibrium as a concept for the second two sets of constraints, where firms competed for a limited amount of labor resources. All the above-noted publications, however, were single-period models, whereas the model in this paper is a multiperiod one. Nagurney [24] recently proposed a single-period supply chain game theory model with labor but with fixed amounts of labor on the links. In that model, production output increased as a function of wages and there were no investments in enhanced labor productivity. Nagurney [25] , also in a single-period model, proposed investments in labor productivity, but the investments did not affect the demand price functions and the financial outlay had a specific form, unlike the general construct in this paper with respect to total cost associated with productivity enhancements, focusing on health and safety of workers. Addressing the health and safety of laborers is now of paramount importance with the double major stressors of the COVID-19 pandemic and climate change. A recent article [26] reveals how outdoor laborers involved in picking produce, who already have hard jobs, are suffering and even dying because of the extreme heat conditions, including in the Pacific Northwest of the USA.",

We consider labor availability to be wage-dependent in that more workers will be willing to work at higher wages, which is justifiable from economics and is being used as a strategy in the pandemic now with labor shortages in many sectors. The wages, hence, are not fixed, as was the case in the above-noted published papers. 3. We allow for investments on link labor productivity enhancements, which are associated with the health and safety of the laborers in their activities of production, transportation, storage, and distribution. 4. The link operational cost functions are dependent not only on the product flows but also on the link labor productivity enhancements made in the first time period, as are the demand price functions. The former capture the possible maintenance needed in subsequent time periods, whereas the latter reflects that consumers (to greater or lesser degrees) are willing to pay more for a product if workers have enhanced protection, which enables greater productivity.",

Equation (2) guarantees that the demand for the product is met at each demand market in each time period. Equation (3) makes sure that the product flow on each link is equal to the sum of the product flows on paths that use that link. Equation (4) represents the nonnegativity assumption on the product path flows. The constraint (5) is the bounds on the labor productivity enhancements on the links, which takes place in time period 1 and then is sustained on the identical link in each subsequent time period. There are upper bounds since there may be physical limitations as to what productivity enhancements can be achieved. The expressions (6) and (7), in turn, reflect that the product output is equal to the link productivity function times the labor in hours available for that link activity (see also, [9, 19, 20] . Note that investments in link productivity enhancements are not allowed on managerial links. Note also that by (6) is also meant that the link productivity function in each time period on a given link is the same over all time periods after time period 1 for the same link (cf. Fig. 1 ) since the labor productivity link enhancement is determined in time period 1 for each link with the investment and then sustained throughout the planning horizon. In addition, here, according to (9), we assume that labor availability is linear with respect to the wage, which is consistent with the work of the Nobel Laureate Angus Deaton; cf. [38] , where many references can be found as to such a frequently used structure by economists. Note that total financial outlay, in turn, that is, the total investments in link labor productivity enhancements, is captured in the function TC(v 1 ) in (1). We now show that objective function (1) can be expressed solely in terms of product path flows and link labor productivity enhancements. Indeed, in view of (3), we can define link total operational cost c a (x, v 1 a ) \u2261\u0109 a (f a , v 1 a ) , for all links a \u2208L . Also, in view of (2), we can define demand price function \u0303k ,t (x, v 1 ) \u2261 k,t (d, v 1 ) , for all k and all t. Applying (6), (7) , and (8) and, subsequently, (4), we conclude that",

The use of a supernetwork, with the addition of links to represent managerial activities, provides a richer framework for supply chain management since the wages of management with their labor hourly values and also productivity are now included. Also, recall that for the managerial links there are no link labor productivity enhancements and, therefore, the productivity factors on the managerial links n and o in our numerical examples consist solely of the factors o and n . In Fig. 4 , we see that as the values of these managerial link factors, which are the same on the managerial link in time period 1 and in time period 2, increase, then the NPV of the firm also increases, but at a decreasing rate over the range that this sensitivity analysis exercise was conducted.",

There have been serious disruptions to supply chains for this and related reasons and, therefore, having rigorous mathematical frameworks that can capture intricacies of supply chain networks, along with labor and various features, including that of labor productivity, is valuable for firms as well as decision makers and policy makers. Although economists have historically contributed to the study of labor, along with wages that should be paid, and how to possibly address labor shortages, they have not considered supply chains in a general context. In this paper, we construct, for the first time, a multiperiod supply chain network optimization model, using the firm's NPV, and a supernetwork formalism, to identify both optimal product flows and labor productivity enhancements. Another novelty of the model is that we include not only operational links but also managerial links since management needs to be involved in supporting the supply chain activities over the time periods. The model is formulated and solved as a variational inequality problem. The solution of the model yields optimal product path and link flows, optimal labor values associated with the various supply chain activities, wages that should be paid, as well as the optimal productivity enhancements.",

It would be interesting to consider extensions of the model in this paper (as well as related ones) to allow for the number of demand markets to change from time period to time period, perhaps, with appropriate additional investments in different time periods. It would also be interesting to allow the number of production sites and distribution centers to change from time period to time period, with an increase in number having an associated investment (but note that the type of investment would be different from the investments in the model in this paper, which are for productivity of labor). Finally, allowing for investments in each time period in terms of labor productivity would also be a valuable extension to the model in this paper.",
