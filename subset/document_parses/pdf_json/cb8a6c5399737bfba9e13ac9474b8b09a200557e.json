Implementation of EU driven reforms in candidate countries largely depends on the rule of law-based enlargement as well as on a clear EU perspective. Overpoliticisation of the enlargement process renders the EU's enlargement law futile and undermines both the transformative effect of the pre-accession process and EU's own values. The implementation of the enlargement condition for settlement of bilateral disputes, which became pronounced in the EU enlargement towards the Western Balkan countries, is having the negative effect of contributing to deterioration rather than promotion of the rule of law in both EU candidate countries and the EU's enlargement process. Lack of predictability and rule of law accordingly, makes the effective application of the principle of conditionality impossible. A genuine reconsideration of the condition for settlement of bilateral disputes within the EU enlargement framework, clear EU perspective and viable way forward are urgently needed for bringing rule of law and the EU's credibility on track.",

This further paves the way for overpoliticization of the enlargement process, rendering the EU's enlargement law futile and undermining both the transformative effect of the pre-accession process and EU's own values. The focus of candidate countries in such circumstances is not so much on the implementation of the necessary reforms but on overcoming political obstacles and hurdles to secure the support of EU Member States or please the Union-an aspect which has been often overlooked by EU institutions. 10 Indeed, conditionality tied to financial assistance in the enlargement process has proved insufficient to achieve any substantial changes in priority sectors, such as the rule of law. 11 Thus, despite many years of EU financial support to reforms in the Western Balkans, in 2018 the European Commission acknowledged the grave deficiencies in guaranteeing the rule of law in the region, stating that 'countries show clear elements of state capture, including links with organised crime and corruption at all levels of government and administration, as well as a strong entanglement of public and private interests [which] feeds a sentiment of impunity and inequality'. 12 It further noted that there is 'extensive political interference in and control of the media [and that a] visibly empowered and independent judiciary and accountable governments and administrations are essential for bringing about the lasting societal change that is needed'. 13 Four years later, the European Court of Auditors found that 'while EU action has contributed to reforms in technical and operational areas, such as improving the efficiency of the judiciary and the development of relevant legislation, it has had little overall impact on fundamental rule of law reforms in the region'. 14 The main reason for that, according to the European Court of Auditors, lies in the 'insufficient domestic political will to drive the necessary reforms'. 15 Overpoliticisation of the enlargement process and lack of predictability, however, have rarely been brought into direct connection with the weak reforms and absence of the rule of law in the Western Balkan countries. While the European Commission made some attempts 16 to promote the enhancement of the accession process and offer a credible EU perspective for the Western Balkans, results are yet to be seen.",

            "text": "This article analyses the rule of law principle through the prism of predictability and critically assesses implementation of the enlargement condition for early settlement of bilateral disputes of candidate countries. Thus, Sect. 2 discusses overpoliticisation of the EU enlargement process and lack of predictability, focusing primarily on conditionality and absence of clarity with regard to the requirement for early settlement of bilateral disputes. Lack of clear EU perspective and legal obscurity of the condition for settlement of bilateral disputes in the enlargement process make the application of the principle of conditionality unworkable. As elaborated in Sect. 3, this drawback of the enlargement process has been also recognised by the European Commission which, however, has not been successful in implementing any meaningful changes to date. Indeed, the current situation 17 and stories from the past are not particularly encouraging. Sections 4 and 5 analyse the pre-accession trajectories of two countries to tell the story of overpoliticisation of the enlargement process at the sacrifice of law: the stories of Croatia and (now) North Macedonia 18 respectively-the first one being the newest EU Member State and the latter being a candidate country stuck in the EU's waiting room for years. What's more, stories of Croatia and North Macedonia are not exceptions but new reality of the enlargement process towards the Western Balkans which may be reasonably expected by other countries in the region given their troubled past and remaining disputes with EU Member States. 19 Section 6, therefore, discusses possible international and EU 16 European Commission, 'Enhancing the accession process-A credible EU perspective for the Western Balkans' COM (2020) 57 final (EC 2020 Communication); European Commission, '2021 Communication on EU Enlargement Policy' COM (2021) 644 final (EC 2021 Communication) . 17 At the time of writing, Albania and North Macedonia have not started their accession negotiations with the EU due to a blockade from Bulgaria over an unresolved bilateral dispute with North Macedonia, although the Macedonian special envoy for resolving the dispute between the Skopje and Sofia authorities, Vlado Buchkovski, most recently informed that the veto will be lifted in the following months, while the two new prime ministers of the countries agreed to improve relations, see Nikolov (2022) and Testorides (2022) respectively. Being linked together in the enlargement process, Albania and North Macedonia share the same destiny even if no bilateral disputes prevent Albania currently from starting its negotiations with the EU. 18 'Republic of Macedonia' changed its name to 'Republic of North Macedonia' on 12 February 2019. The change of the name of the country has been discussed in more detail in Sect. 5 of this article. The new name of the country is used in this article for discussion of the circumstances after the country officially changed its name. 19 These include but are not limited to: Croatia-Serbia dispute on their border in the Danube area, for which the (now) President of Croatia noted back in 2014, while he was still a Prime Minister of that country, that settlement should be made condition for Serbia during the accession negotiations, see Bo\u0161njak and Ciglene\u010dki (2014) , see more recent discussion about the possibility for blockade over the border dispute \u017de\u017eelj (2021) ; Moreover Croatia and Serbia cannot agree on several areas that none of the two countries claims, two of which have been even proclaimed Free Republics (Liberland and Verdis), see Jenkins (2016) , Kruljac (2021) and the official website of Free Republic of Verdis < https:// www. verdi sgov. org/ > ; Bosnia-Croatia disputed sections of the boundary, and primarily the one related to maritime access, see Brezar (2021) ; a Croatia-Montenegro sea border dispute at the Prevlaka peninsula Kajosevic (2020) , to mention but a few bilateral disputes that may be problematized in the EU enlargement process. mechanisms for settlement of bilateral disputes. It is argued that the EU enlargement framework does not offer an appropriate platform for settlement of bilateral disputes that fall outside the EU law. Instead, solution should be sought in making use of Article 273 TFEU which would allow states to settle their bilateral disputes on equal footing by employing CJEU, and enjoy better security with regard to the implementation and compliance with the final decision of that Court. This would help both the Union and candidate countries in overcoming current and future stalemates of the enlargement process owed to unresolved bilateral disputes. Drawing on previous sections, Sect. 7 presents the general conclusions of this article.",

            "text": "The EU enlargement to the Western Balkans is a perfect example of the imperfect and highly politicised enlargement process. While Croatia joined EU after overcoming political struggles with neighbouring Slovenia and enjoying support from other Member States, other Western Balkan countries remain outsiders with blurry vision of the future. Indeed, the future EU integration of the Western Balkans is almost as uncertain now as over 18 years ago, i.e. before the Thessaloniki Agenda from 2003, 20 which confirmed the EU accession perspective for the countries of the region. Almost two decades after committing to support the EU integration of the Western Balkan countries and welcome them in the future, EU Member States reaffirmed their support for the region at the EU-Western Balkans summit of 6 October 2021 with lots of hesitations. 21 The attempt of the host, Slovenia, to convince EU Member States commit to a timeline for the future accession of the Western Balkan countries was, therefore, expectedly unsuccessful. 22 The EU enlargement process has, therefore, become more unpredictable than ever before, depending more on domestic policies and EU circumstances than on the actual reforms of candidate countries in line with the established enlargement criteria. Yet, predictability is the key procedural rule of law component of the enlargement regulation. 23 As such, it is inevitably connected to pre-accession conditionality, which in absence of predictability, could be hardly attainable. As more recently clarified by the European Commission, predictability, and conditionality in the enlargement process mean 'ensur [ing] greater clarity on what the Union expects of enlargement countries at different stages of the process, and what the positive and negative consequences are of progress or lack thereof'. 24 As further confirmed by the Commission, '[t]he core element of the merit-based accession process is its conditionality. However, in order to achieve that, conditions must be clear from the outset. (\u2026) These conditions must be objective, precise, detailed, strict and verifiable'. 25 That said, the condition for settlement of bilateral disputes has neither been clear from the outset, nor is it 'objective, precise, detailed, strict and verifiable', 26 which makes the pre-accession process highly unpredictable as no assessment criteria for fulfilment of the condition for settlement of disputes exist. In other words, progress of countries towards membership depends on satisfaction of involved Member States from the outcome of the dispute settlement rather than on any 'objective, precise, detailed, strict and verifiable' condition. The opportunities for Member States to exert pressure in the enlargement process can vary 'from withholding consent to the opening of negotiating chapters, to objecting to the graduation of a country to a new phase (candidate membership, opening of negotiations, membership)'. 27 Indeed, Member States have a crucial role in the enlargement process. As put by Kochenov, '[i] t is notable that the [EU] Institutions, although taking part in the process of enlargement preparation, do not sign the Treaties of Accession. Clearly, enlargement of the EU is not about the Union enlarging but about the Member States enlarging the Union with the help of Institutions'. 28 Yet, allowing Member States to redefine enlargement criteria in line with their domestic preferences and politics does not only undermine the rule of law as a fundamental part of the enlargement regulation, but also discredits the entire enlargement process.",

Maintaining and enhancing this policy is thus indispensable for the EU's credibility, for the EU' success and for the EU's influence in the region and beyond-especially at times of heightened geopolitical competition '. 41 Weaknesses of the enlargement process were also emphasised by the Commission. In particular, it has been noted that: ' [it] is of major importance to build more trust among all stakeholders and to enhance the accession process and make it more effective. It has to become more predictable, more credible-based on objective criteria and rigorous positive and negative conditionality, and reversibility-more dynamic and subject to stronger political steering. 42 Indeed, predictability is the core rule of law component of the enlargement regulation, in the absence of which successful implementation of pre-accession criteria through conditionality is hardly possible. The perspective of EU accession is the most important incentive for aspiring countries and, as such, is of significant importance for the implementation of the necessary reforms, including the rule of law related reforms, in these countries.",

The plan was clear: good progress of Western Balkan countries in implementing reforms would lead to closer integration with the EU, increased funding and investments, while backsliding could lead to sanctioning. Yet, not much has been done for the promotion of the rule of law in the light of the condition for settlement of bilateral disputes in the pre-accession process since the EC 2020 Communication. Indeed, unpredictability has become the most predictable aspect of the EU enlargement policy, despite the efforts of the European Commission to reinvigorate the process.

            "text": "Although both Slovenia and Croatia wanted to see a settlement of the bilateral dispute, they disagreed on the method which was to be used to reach a solution. Assuming to have the law on its side, Croatia was in favour of using the ICJ for the settlement of the dispute, while Slovenia preferred a '[political] mediation instead of judicial arbitration'. 70 Stepping out of the legal framework, Slovenia employed its EU membership powers to achieve political gains by securing non-juridical arbitration, which promised the country a more favourable outcome. To secure its position, Slovenia effectively blocked the opening or closing of fourteen negotiation chapters with Croatia, not all of them connected to compliance with the accession criteria. 71 Ultimately, on 4 November 2009, the two parties signed an Arbitration Agreement under the EU auspices including specific provision related to the pre-accession process. 72 Thus, Article 9 of the Arbitration Agreement stipulated that 'Slovenia shall lift its reservations as regards opening and closing of negotiation chapters where the obstacle is related to the dispute' 73 and that '[b] oth Parties shall refrain from any action or statement which might negatively affect the accession negotiations'. 74 On 1 July 2013, 75 Croatia became the newest Member State of the EU. 76 The Commission applauded the launch of the arbitration process between Slovenia and Croatia despite the fact that the Arbitration Agreement meant defeat for the rule of law in the enlargement process. In the words of the (then) European Commissioner for Enlargement, \u0160tefan F\u00fcle, the 'common agreement [was] a very welcome signal for the positive development of the good neighbourly relations between the two countries as well as for the Western Balkans regions showing that even difficult issues can be best solved by means of dialogue and cooperation'. 77 The Arbitration Agreement, however, was rather a result of the pressure on the candidate country in the pre-accession process and imposition of the Member State involved in the bilateral dispute than of good neighbourly dialogue and cooperation between the two neighbouring countries. Yet, as already noted, settlement of disputes under pressure and outside the proper legal framework may not be sustainable in the long run. This is particularly the case when circumstances or position of involved countries change to which further developments in the arbitration process between Croatia and Slovenia testify. Specifically, the settlement of the bilateral dispute between Croatia and Slovenia before the Arbitral Tribunal did not go as planned. The award of the Arbitral Tribunal which should have been binding on 70 Uilenreef (2010) the two parties and should have constituted a definitive settlement of the dispute, 78 has not come into force. This was substantially due to a violation of the Arbitration Agreement by Slovenia but also due to the fact that Croatia was already an EU Member State at that time, free of threats for blockages of its EU membership.",

The Commission's Legal Service emphasised in its legal opinion that it 'considers that most of the heads of claim put forward by Slovenia in order to establish a breach of EU law by Croatia are established' 111 and that 'the Commission must observe that there is an arbitration agreement \u2026 Therefore, the outcome of the arbitration procedure must be respected by the EU, and provisions of EU law must be interpreted in the light of it'. 112 The legal opinion of the Commission's Legal Service was, however, put aside.

The Commission states that production of the opinion in proceedings before the Court was not authorised.

            "text": "In addition, Slovenia has argued that Croatia infringed: Regulation ( Croatia asked the CJEU to dismiss Slovenia's action as inadmissible on the basis that alleged infringements were 'ancillary to settlement of the dispute concerning the validity and legal effects of the arbitration agreement and the arbitration award' 116 and accordingly, 'the Court lacks jurisdiction to rule on the infringement of obligations arising from EU law if those obligations are ancillary to prior settlement of another dispute that does not fall within the jurisdiction of the Court'. 117 As argued by Croatia, the real subject matter of the dispute related to the validity and legal effects of the arbitration agreement which falls outside EU law, and of the arbitration award which has not been implemented. 118 Croatia thus argued that the Court lacked jurisdiction 'under Article 259 TFEU to rule on the validity and effects of either the arbitration agreement, which is an international agreement not forming an integral part of EU law, or the arbitration award made on the basis of that agreement'. 119 The CJEU agreed with Croatia, concluding that 'the infringements of EU law pleaded are ancillary to the alleged failure by the Republic of Croatia to comply with the obligations arising from a bilateral international agreement to which the European Union is not a party and whose subject matter falls outside the areas of EU competence'. 120 As a consequence, the CJEU confirmed that it lacks jurisdiction to rule in the action brought by Slovenia. 121 The CJEU thus set the infringement threshold triggering action either under Article 258 TFEU or 259 TFEU above 'ancillary' connections between the alleged breach of EU law and obligations under the bilateral treaty that causes a breach. 122 The fact that the EU witnessed the Arbitration Agreement and participated in its conclusion was not 'sufficient for the arbitration agreement and the arbitration award to be considered an integral part of EU law'. 123 In other words, 'subject matter of an action for failure to fulfil obligations brought under Article 259 TFEU can only be non-compliance with obligations arising from EU law', 124 rather than non-compliance with obligations falling outside the scope of EU law. This is even if anticipated compliance by the candidate country with such obligations has been made important EU accession criterion and the relevant EU Accession Treaty has been modified in line with such anticipation. 125 Put differently, settlement of disputes that fall outside the scope of EU law may not be sustainable in the long run unless there is a strong determination, will and support on both sides for such settlement and the methods used. Once the candidate country becomes an EU Member State, enforcement of the bilateral treaty or award cannot be guaranteed given the problems of enforceability of international decisions and lack of jurisdiction of the CJEU. 126 Furthermore, in its previous case law, the CJEU held that 'it lacks jurisdiction to give a ruling on (\u2026) interpretation (of international Convention), and on the obligations arising under it for the Member States since (\u2026) it was an international agreement concluded by the Member States which did not form an integral part of Community law'. 127 two Member States 'to strive sincerely to bring about a definitive legal solution consistent with international law (\u2026) that ensures the effective and unhindered application of EU law in the areas concerned, and to bring their dispute to an end by using one or other means of settling it'. 128 Yet, it should be recalled that the Arbitral Tribunal already issued its Final Award and determined the borders between the countries, deciding also previously that 'Croatia was not entitled to terminate the Agreement' 129 and that the 'Arbitration Agreement remains in force'. 130 To put it another way, the mechanism for settlement of the bilateral dispute supported, if not imposed upon the candidate country in the pre-accession process, as well as the outcome of the entire process have been largely discarded post-accession.",

            "text": "Last but not least, to agree with McGarry, by deciding that it lacks jurisdiction in Slovenia v Croatia, the CJEU mapped out the rule of law principle and the principle of sincere cooperation as general principles which may be invoked in infringement procedures only when there is first a violation of a more specific obligation under EU law. 131 In particular, Slovenia alleged that Croatia infringed Article 2 TEU, rejecting to abide by the rule of law by failing to comply with the arbitration award contrary to the commitment entered into during the EU accession process and that it has infringed, in that respect, the principles of sincere cooperation and res judicata. Rather than looking into pacta sunt servanda as a general principle of law and a component of the rule of law principle, 132 the CJEU went on to conclude that in order to verify the alleged violation of the rule of law principle, it would have had to examine the extent and limits of the territories of Croatia and Slovenia in the light of the arbitration award which went beyond its powers. 133 While supremacy of EU law and non-applicability of the pacta sunt servanda principle to bilateral treaties between Member States that are in conflict with EU law have been long established, 134 the case of Slovenia v Croatia was rather different concerning alleged infringement of a bilateral treaty that formed an essential part of the accession negotiations rather than involving conflict of EU law. Notwithstanding the reasons of the Court-be that the political sensitiveness of the issue or politicisation of the case, 135 the contaminated arbitration process or the unfair treatment of Croatia in the preaccession process-the CJEU ruling has paved the way for future instances of noncompliance with obligations arising from bilateral treaties, international decisions and arbitration awards alike.

The story of the settlement of the name dispute is not one that EU should be particularly proud of. It is a story about the triumph of politics over the rule of law in the enlargement process and devaluation of EU values. Yet, the final solution to the dispute may be unsustainable in the long run considering the issues that may arise from disrespect for the law and potential change of circumstances in the future. Macedonia successfully escaped the armed conflicts that followed the break-up of Yugoslavia. However, an unsolved dispute between Greece and Macedonia over the name of the latter became problematic as the country started to move slowly towards NATO and EU. Since the early 1990s, the name of the newly independent state became one of the dominant issues in the politics of the neighbouring countries both of which involved in lengthy negotiations. 137 The dispute over the name occurred at a variety of levels and in a variety of contexts. 138 The newly independent country initially faced problems with its admission to the UN and with its recognition by EU Member States which led to the saga with its prospective accession to NATO and the EU. 139 Following the admission of Macedonia to the UN, that organisation undertook bringing the two parties to an agreement through special mediators. In 1995 an Interim Accord was signed which regulated the conduct of the two countries and became the main framework for development of their relations.",

The Interim Accord also secured the future Euro-Atlantic integration of the newly independent state. Greece committed not to block the accession of Macedonia under its provisional name in any regional or international organisation. 141 The Interim Agreement went even further, stipulating an obligation on Greece to actively support the on-going economic development of Macedonia 'through international cooperation, as far as possible by a close relationship of [that country] with the European Economic Area and the European Union'. 142 It further reaffirmed the willingness of the parties to be 137 For a brief summary of the arguments of the two states and a chronological record of the developments regarding the dispute see CoE: Parliamentary Assembly -Working papers -2008 Ordinary Session (Second part) 14-18 April -Volume III (2008) guided by the principles of international law, including 'democracy and fundamental freedoms and respect for human rights and dignity, in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations, as well as the Helsinki Final Act, the Charter of Paris for a new Europe and pertinent acts of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe'. 143 In 2008, however, Greece vetoed Macedonia's accession to NATO. 144 The membership of Macedonia to NATO was made explicitly conditional upon the settlement of the name issue contrary to the earlier binding agreement between the two neighbouring states. 145 That act, as later confirmed by the ICJ, constituted a direct breach of Article 11(1) of the Interim Accord which prohibited Greece from vetoing the accession of Macedonia to international organisations or to institutions of which it itself is a member. 146 The NATO veto had almost an immediate impact in the EU enlargement context. In fact, the Accession Partnership with Macedonia which preceded the Bucharest Summit had already shifted away from the previous EU approach and listed the solution over the name issue in the short term priorities for the country. 147 The pressure on the country started increasing. Only two months after the NATO Summit, the Brussels European Council underlined that the 'maintaining good neighbourly relations, including a negotiated and mutually acceptable solution on the name issue remains essential' 148 for the further progress of Macedonia towards the EU. Such a reaction was not only inconsistent with the previous EU approach but also ignored the legal significance of the Interim Accord, if not actively encouraging its further violation.",

The abstention of Greece from objections to Macedonia's prospective EU membership, as envisaged in the Interim Accord, was the only guarantee for preserving equality of the two countries in the process of settling the dispute. And the ICJ judgement confirming Greece's violation did not change the situation on the ground. Moreover, the Court rejected to order the infringing party to comply with its international obligations, considering that '[a]s a general rule, there is no reason to suppose that a State whose act or conduct has been declared wrongful by the Court will repeat that act or conduct in the future, since its good faith must be presumed '. 149 Contrary to the ICJ's presumptions, Greece did not comply with its obligations under the Interim Accord. The judgment has also had little impact of note at an EU level despite constant rhetoric that bilateral disputes between countries should be settled in accordance with the principles of international law. It is the international agreement for settlement of the dispute between the neighbouring countries and the ICJ judgement precisely that have been put aside within the EU enlargement process, alongside the fundamental principle of sovereign equality of states in international law.",

            "text": "Thus, one of the arguments of the applicants that was rejected by the Constitutional Court was that the nature of the referendum was not well clarified. In particular, it has been rightly argued that it was not clear from the beginning whether the referendum was of consultative or mandatory nature. The Decision of the Assembly on announcing a referendum was based on Article 73(1) which stipulated that 'the Assembly decides on issuing notice of a referendum concerning specific matters within its sphere of competence by a majority vote of the total number of Representatives'. 154 In paragraph 2, that same Article stipulates that '[t]he decision of the majority of voters in a referendum is adopted on condition that more than half of the total number of voters voted, and in paragraph 4, it stipulates that '[t]he decision made in a referendum is binding'. 155 Furthermore, a mandatory referendum is announced in cases where a decision on joining or leaving an association or community with other states is made in accordance with Articles 29 of the Referendum Law and Article 120 of the Constitution. The referendum question was certainly formulated in a way to ask voters if they supported membership of the country in the EU, even if a condition for accepting the Treaty of Prespa has been attached to such membership. 156 With regard to the nature of the referendum and the decision of the referendum, the Constitutional Court opined that it was evident from Article 1 of the Decision of the Assembly on announcing a referendum for 'consulting' citizens on the entire territory of the country that the referendum was of consultative nature without discussing extensively the legal basis or the decision of the Government to hold consultative rather than mandatory referendum for a question of significant importance. Having explained the nature of the referendum, the Constitutional Court concluded that the referendum 'decision does not generate legal, but only a moral obligation for the Assembly to act in accordance with the will of the citizens. It is a constitutional right of the Assembly to decide whether, when and how it will regulate the issue for which the citizens were consulted in such a referendum'. 157 The explanation of the Constitutional Court came less than two weeks before the referendum day, and could have been hardly heard and understood by the general public who were led to believe by the Prime Minister of the country, Mr. Zoran Zaev, that their will expressed in the referendum will be respected. 158 154 Decision to announce a referendum; Constitution of the Republic of North Macedonia < https:// vlada. mk/ sites/ defau lt/ files/ dokum enti/ zakoni/ the_ const ituti on_ of_ the_ repub lic_ of_ north_ maced onia_ conta ining_ the_ valid_ const ituti onal_ provi sions_ in_ force_ as_ amend ed_ by_ const ituti onal_ amend ments_ixxxvi. pdf > accessed 7 January 2022. 155 Constitution of the Republic of North Macedonia. 156 Cf Judge Gosheva and Judge Josifovski. 157 Resolution U.no.88/2018 , 90/2018 , 91/2018 (19 September 2018 , para. 6. 158 See e.g. an interview of the Prime Minister given to a Greek TV before the referendum: < https:// www. youtu be. com/ watch?v= 3pEuR SWFEQ A&t= 162s > accessed 7 January 2022. Furthermore, it has been argued that the text of the referendum question was ambiguous and vague contrary to Article 15 of the Law on Referendum which stipulates that: (3) If it is voted for more issues, it shall be voted for each issue at a separate ballot; (4) The issue on the ballot must be precisely formulated and unambiguous, so that the citizen at the referendum may answer by \"FOR\" or \"AGAINST\"'. 159 The Constitutional Court rejected this argument too, noting that the referendum question 'is content of one issue with interconnected, necessary whole, in a historical social context because among its parts there is an internal connection that allows full freedom of expression of citizens' will as required by the principle of unity of content of the question'. 160 However, even if not contrary to Article 15 of the Law on Referendum, the referendum question suggesting guaranteed NATO and EU membership if people voted in favour of the Treaty of Prespa has been certainly misleading-an aspect which has been even missed by the dissenting judges. 161 Indeed, an average citizen who is not aware of the complex enlargement process including the lengthy negotiations procedure and possible future blockades might have reasonably expected that EU accession would have followed immediately after the acceptance of the Treaty of Prespa and that EU accession depended solely on the settlement of the bilateral dispute with Greece. Yet, the Constitutional Court has accepted the referendum question with unbearable easiness noting that 'consultation with citizens does not mean deciding to join the EU and NATO in the absolute sense of the word' 162 and also that such consultative referendum 'in no way infringes any right or obligation for mandatory referendum to be announced in the cases stipulated by the Constitution, and that does not mean taking away the decisive power of the citizens on the issues regulated by the Constitution'. 163 What the Constitutional Court has missed, however, is the relation between the text of the referendum question and the nature of the referendum. If a referendum question asks voters whether they are in favour of EU membership by accepting certain Treaty, why would an average citizen think that he has not been asked to decide on EU membership 'in the absolute sense of the word'? Referendum questions do not have asterisks to warn voters that 'terms and conditions apply'! The referendum question, therefore, violated the fundamental principle of legal certainty of the citizens and intentionally or not, the Constitutional Court failed to prevent violation of the law, putting itself on the side of both the Government and the EU rather than defending the rule of law in the country. 159 Law on Referendum and Other Forms of Direct Vote of Citizens ('Official Gazette of the Republic of Macedonia' no. 81/2005). 160 Resolution U.no.88/2018 , 90/2018 , 91/2018 (19 September 2018 ), para. 6 (Resolution U.no.88/2018 , 90/2018 , 91/2018 . 161 Cf Judge Gosheva and Judge Josifovski. 162 Resolution U.no.88/2018 , 90/2018 , 91/2018 , para. 6. 163 Resolution U.no.88/2018 , 90/2018 , 91/2018 ",

Most of the citizens who were against the Treaty of Prespa boycotted the referendum not to allow for quorum in accordance with the Constitution rather than voting in the negative.

This allowed for adoption of the Law on Ratification in a simplified parliamentarian procedure without any serious debate and opposition in the Parliament, even if no EU law was 164 The 'Report on the final results of the voting at the referendum on a state level' of 20 September 2018 is available at: < https:// dejure. mk/ zakon/ izves htaj-za-konec hnite-rezul tati-od-glasa njeto-na-refer endum ot-na-drzha vno-nivo-30-septe mvri-2018-godina > accessed 7 January 2022 (Report on the final results of the voting at the referendum). 165 Report on the final results of the voting at the referendum. 166 European Commission, 'Key findings of the 2019 Report on North Macedonia' (29 May 2019) available at: < https:// ec. europa. eu/ commi ssion/ press corner/ detail/ en/ COUNT RY_ 19_ 2777 > accessed 7 January 2022. 167 Resolution U.no.88/2018 167 Resolution U.no.88/ , 90/2018 167 Resolution U.no.88/ , 91/2018 Karakamisheva and Saveski (2018), pp. 36-38. related to the matter. In other words, the simplified procedure for adopting 'Laws with European flag' has been misused to avoid much expected complications in the process of ratification in the Assembly. Again, EU remained silent to such violation of the legal procedure which is often practiced in the country when ratification of difficult laws are on the table even if such laws are unrelated or even contrary to EU law. 169 Finally, the process of passing constitutional amendments in the country has been largely surrounded by allegations of bribery and corruption as well as by painful compromises criticised even by some of the advocates of the entire process. 170 Last but not least, although helping both parties to reach settlement to their longlasting dispute, the Treaty of Prespa did not necessarily resolve all issues between the two neighbouring countries. 171 The interpretation of the Treaty of Prespa might be a major challenge for both parties in the following years. 172 Even more concerning, however, is the possibility that the Treaty of Prespa might not have solved anything in the long run. As shown in the case of Croatia, bilateral agreements have little value once the candidate country becomes an EU Member State. Should, therefore, North Macedonia eventually access the EU, the Treaty of Prespa may be disputed, if not unilaterally annulled, leaving the EU with no means to tackle that decision.",

This is also largely a result of the growing indignation after the country failed to start the accession negotiations once it changed its name owing to new blockades from other EU Member States. After the ratification of the Treaty of Prespa, the beginning of the EU accession negotiations was blocked by France 2019, as well as by The Netherlands and Denmark albeit to a lesser extent, although such blockade was mainly intended for Albania which is in a same 'enlargement package' with North Macedonia. 174 When that blockade was lifted, another bilateral dispute over history, national identity, and language surfaced in 2020, involving Bulgaria and North Macedonia this time and blocking the start of the accession negotiations of the latter. 175 In other words, the progress of North Macedonia towards the EU has 169 Tumanovska (2019); Tanevski (2021) . 170 Rose (2019). 171 E.g. in the more recent European Football Championship the use of the name 'Macedonia' by the Football Federation was problematised testifies.

The politicised settlement of the name dispute might have not solved the issue between the two countries in the long run. It has rather contributed to further deterioration of the rule of law in the enlargement process and also in the candidate country. The EU disregarded both the Interim Accord and the ICJ judgment, supporting the cloudy referendum process and post-referendum violations of various laws in the country which significantly contributed to further backsliding of the rule of law in the candidate country rather than to any positive reforms. Indeed, even some of the greatest supporters of the referendum have recognised that the price of achieving the change of the name of the country 'might have been too high in terms of derogation of the rule of law'. 177 As noted by the conflict analyst and former rule of law officer Eric Manton, '[t] here are serious concerns that the way the process was carried out and that painful compromises, made in the name of achieving the result, will be difficult to overcome in order to fully capitalize on the new opportunities of Euro-Atlantic integration'. 178 In the light of the EU enlargement process, Manton somewhat rhetorically asks: '[w]ill some EU member states evaluate the steps taken in this process as counter to EU values and see this as an obstacle for EU aspirations?'. 179 It is, however, the EU itself that pushed for and applauded the process notwithstanding the means. Evaluating the steps taken in the process would necessarily have to start with an evaluation of the EU's enlargement condition for settlement of bilateral disputes and EU's priorities in the Western Balkans. To agree with Manton, EU values including the rule of law have been indeed widely disregarded in the context of the Treaty of Prespa. That said, the Treaty of Prespa would have not seen the light of day without the strong encouragement and pressure from the EU itself.",

Should such disputes, however, be brought in connection with EU law, as threatening to undermine the achievements of the integration process, it would be for the EU dispute settlement mechanism to safeguard the compliance of the Member States involved.",

Indeed, being asked what measures could it take to mediate between Italy and France in order to resolve their long standing territorial dispute in the Mont Blank, the European Commission relied on the CJEU ruling in Slovenia v Croatia, underlining that 'it is for each Member State to determine the extent and limits of its own territory, in accordance with the rules of public international law. In view of this being a matter of national competence, the Commission 180 These include but are not limited to: the Mont Blanc summit dispute between France and Italy; Rockall, uninhabited island in the North Atlantic Ocean disputed by Denmark, Iceland, Ireland, and the UK, see Derrig (2021) ; dispute between Germany and the Netherlands with regard to the exact course of border through Dollart bay, see Gerard (1987) ; dispute between Austria, Germany and Switzerland over the boundaries between the three states in Lake Constance, see Frowein (1990) ; dispute between Portugal and Spain regarding the status of Olivenza (Black 1979) , to mention only some of the unsettled bilateral disputes between EU Member States. 181 Anderson (2000) . 182 Miall (2007) , p. 14, distinguishes between four different types of change that could lead to transformation of conflicts: actor transformation (change in the existing parties or appearance of new ones); issue transformation (change in the priority of interests and more particularly '[reducing] the relative importance of issues on which antagonism exists and [emphasizing] the issues on which commonality prevails'); rule transformation (change in the norms in interstate relations); and structural transformation (change in the relationship between actors). Two additional types of changes have been added by other scholars: Ramsbotham, Voodhouse and Miall (2011) , p. 175, consider changes in the social, regional or international context which surround a conflict as important. Diez et al. (2008) , p. 7, add changes to the communication that constructs the conflict. McCall (1998), p. 392, argues that '[b] y challenging the power of the nation-state centre, initiating supranational citizenship and encouraging a multilevel system of government, the EU polity is beginning to display a reconstructivist impulse'.",

The intention of the EU not to get involved into sensitive issues ended up infamously with the CJEU disregarding both the Arbitration Agreement, which the EU previously witnessed and supported in the accession process, and the Final Award. The CJEU's judgment also confirmed that bilateral treaties that fall outside the EU law will not be interpreted or enforced in the EU even if the conclusion of the treaty was an important accession condition for any of the countries involved. Once both states involved in the dispute become Member States and the EU accession incentive is gone, the enforcement of the bilateral treaty would be largely dependent on the good faith of the involved countries. Actions against Member States brought under Article 258 TFEU or 259 TFEU for alleged infringements of EU law that are ancillary to settlement of bilateral disputes would be dismissed by the CJEU due to lack of jurisdiction. Put differently, the case of Croatia shows that the pre-accession condition for settlement of bilateral disputes which often halts the enlargement process contrary to the rule of law principle, losses both its significance and its aim post-accession, notwithstanding the outcome of the dispute settlement process. More importantly, however, the somewhat forced agreement for the settlement of the bilateral dispute has not contributed to the strengthening of the rule of law in the pre-accession process. Quite to the contrary, it has made the enlargement process less predictable by putting ambitions and domestic policies of Member States before the established Copenhagen criteria and the international principle of sovereign equality of states.",

More than 16 years after receiving candidate status, the rule of law in the country remains weak despite constant recommendations of the European Commission for opening of the accession negotiations since 2009. Rather than enforcing Copenhagen criteria and making the pre-accession progress of the country conditional on the strengthening of the rule of law, the EU has invested enormous efforts in what was essentially a political bilateral dispute between states, ignoring if not supporting the violation of the rule of law in the candidate country. The EU has first ignored the Interim Accord between Greece and Macedonia, then it ignored the ICJ judgement confirming breach of the Interim Accord by one of the sides involved, and finally it supported and cherished the change of the name of the candidate country despite the many irregularities of the process resulting in further deterioration of the rule of law. Yet, even the high price of sacrificing the law has not brought joy to the candidate country but opened the way to more blockades and bilateral disputes. This has added further to the lack of predictability of the enlargement process, putting future reforms in the field of rule of law in the country into question. Moreover, the EU cannot secure the continuity and enforcement of the Prespa Agreement or of any other bilateral treaty that falls outside the scope of EU law once and if North Macedonia becomes an EU Member State. The pacta sunt servanda principle does not apply to bilateral treaties between Member States owing to EU law supremacy over such treaties.",

Permanent solution to bilateral disputes that fall outside the EU law cannot be achieved through political pressure and power exercise in the pre-accession process but require strong leadership and respect for the rule of law notwithstanding the framework. While the settlement of only two bilateral disputes has been discussed in this article, remaining unresolved disputes between other Western Balkan countries and candidate countries may prove equally problematic. Should the EU continue to apply political conditionality for settlement of such disputes in the pre-accession process, i.e. within a framework of asymmetric relations, there will be hardly any progress of the rule of law in the candidate countries.",

Settlement of bilateral disputes by the CJEU under Article 273 TFEU, once all involved parties have become Member States, might be, therefore, an optimal solution. In such case, the EU would be able to frame settlement of bilateral disputes as an 'objective, precise, detailed, strict and verifiable' enlargement condition with credible post-accession consequences. Infiltrating Article 273 TFEU in the enlargement framework would correct the level of unbalanced powers between Member States and candidate countries, and would presumably contribute to decrease in the number of bilateral disputes.",
