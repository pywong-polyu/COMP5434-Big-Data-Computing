Thus, SDF has been confirmed as one of the best treatment approaches in the control of dental caries in primary dentition [18] . However, at a 1-year follow-up, the survival rate of SDF treated teeth in patients aged 0 to 64 treated in community dental clinics was reported by Raskin et al. to have increased from 76 to 84% when covered by a restoration on the same day as SDF application [5] . This underlines the benefit that can )   T0  T1  T2  T0  T1  T2  T0  T1  T2  T0  T1 be obtained by restoring teeth after SDF treatment and underscores the need for further research in this area. Different restorative materials, such as self-cured GI (SCGI), resin-modified GI (RMGI) and CMP, have been used to restore cavitated teeth following SDF treatment (with or without KI). In their systematic review, Roberts et al. assessed the effectiveness and extent of staining reduction achieved when SDF was followed by KI application, showing that the application of KI after SDF might reduce staining [27] . Only one of the included studies, conducted by Nguyen et al., compared the impact of different white restorative materials on the lightness of tooth structures treated by SDF or SDF + KI [28] . However, the study was conducted on permanent teeth. Hence, its results cannot be generalized for primary teeth.",

However, how to reduce the discoloration associated with the application of SDF in primary teeth remains unclear. Several studies have tried to measure the parental acceptance of SDF application in children [22] . One reported that only 53.3% of parents considered SDF treatment for their children acceptable due to discoloration problems [23] . Sabbagh et al. showed that parental acceptance of SDF treatment was significantly higher for posterior teeth than for anterior teeth [22] . Hence, this study aimed to quantify the color change produced by SDF in primary molars as well as the masking effect of the KI bleaching agent and CMP and GI restorations. Our study also followed up on these color changes after Suntest aging, which was shown to be a relevant method for testing discoloration [30] .",

Treatment with SDF caused obvious discoloration of carious dentin. 2. The factor \"material\" influenced the masking of the color change produced by the application of SDF on primary dentin. 3. Directly after SDF application, all materials (KI, CMP, and GI) could effectively mask the color change associated with the application of SDF. 4. CMP was the only material whose color masking effect was not completely reversed by aging. 5. Aging had a significantly different effect on the color shifts of all treatment materials and hence their masking effects, with the greatest effect being on GI and the least on CMP. 6. KI has good potential to mask the color changes associated with the application of SDF, but further studies are needed to test its masking effect in combination with CMP. ",
