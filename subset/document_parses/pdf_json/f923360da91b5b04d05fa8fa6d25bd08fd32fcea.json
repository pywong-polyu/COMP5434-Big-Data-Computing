Since then, all practice, knowledge, and attitudes have been continuously developed for the COVID-19 siege. 3 The full clinical presentation of COVID-19 still not understood, but among the most common presentations were cough, fever, dyspnea, and pneumonia. To date, no effective vaccines or specific drugs have been reported that specifically act against COVID-19. 4 So, early identification of severity and prognosis of COVID-19 is very important to enable intervention for the reduction of mortality risk. Egypt announced the detection of the first COVID-19 case on the 14th of February 2020. 5 After this, Egypt aimed to prevent the spread of COVID-19 infection with a partial ban that began on the 25th of March. Nasopharyngeal swabs for real-time reverse transcription-PCR (rRT-PCR) were obtained from patients with symptoms and, for cases confirmed to have COVID-19, contacts from the previous 2 weeks were traced and swabs were also obtained from them. rRT-PCR was repeated 48 h later for highly suspicious patients. Additionally, screening at the Egyptian airports by measurement of body temperature, clinical evaluation, and the use of the rapid diagnostic specific IgM and IgG test was performed. 6 Since no previous Egyptian studies could be traced in the literature regarding COVID-19, we performed a retrospective analysis of a cohort of patients proved to have COVID-19 who were managed in ESNA's quarantine hospital, Upper Egypt. The analysis included their characteristics and outcomes.

In agreement with our findings, Liu et al 10 reported that elderly patients with COVID-19 are more likely to progress to severe COVID-19 disease in comparison with young and middleaged COVID-19 patients. Also, Mahase 11 and Yang et al 12 reported similar findings. This could be explained by the age-dependent decline in cell-mediated immune function and reduced humoral immune function. 13 Among the co-morbidities associated with COVID-19 in our study, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and ischemic heart disease were the most prevalent chronic diseases. These findings were in accordance with a metaanalysis study which reported that hypertension, cardiovascular diseases, and diabetes mellitus were among the most prevalent underlying diseases among hospitalized COVID-19 patients. 14 Using logistic regression analysis, the present study revealed that the presence of diabetes mellitus could be a significant predictor for the severity of COVID-19. In line with our findings, Marhl et al 15 reported a higher risk for COVID-19 among diabetic patients because of the associated dysregulation of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), liver dysfunction, and chronic inflammation. Also, Singh et al 16 provided evidence of increased incidence and severity of COVID-19 in diabetic patients. Limited data are available regarding the contribution of tobacco smoking to the spread, severity, and poor outcome in COVID-19. 17 Smoking has been related to higher ACE2 expression, which has been stated to be a receptor for SARS-CoV-2 (pre-print). 18 Our findings revealed the lack of significant difference regarding COVID-19 severity in terms of smoking. A systematic review included five studies and reported that smoking may be associated with a negative outcome. 19 This heterogeneity could be attributed to differences in the study designs, outcomes, or regions.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 369, "end": 371, "text": "11", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 387, "end": 389, "text": "12", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 540, "end": 542, "text": "13", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 1145, "end": 1147, "text": "15", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 1573, "end": 1575, "text": "17", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 1695, "end": 1697, "text": "18", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 1915, "end": 1917, "text": "19", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Our study revealed that dyspnea, fever, dry cough, sore throat, and malaise were the most frequent clinical presentations among COVID-19 patients, while headache and diarrhea were the least frequent ones, and some patients were asymptomatic. In line with our findings, Guan et al 20 reported that the most common COVID-19 presentations were fever and cough (88.7% and 67.8%, respectively). Although nausea and/or vomiting (5%) and diarrhea (3.8%) were reported, they were uncommon. A possible explanation for the mild gastrointestinal manifestation is the attenuation of SARS-CoV-2 virulence after swallowing by the effect of digestive enzymes which cause its degradation. 9 Also, Chan et al 21 and Wang et al 22 were in agreement with our findings. Additionally, our data revealed that only dyspnea rather than other presenting manifestations was significantly associated with COVID-19 severity. In accordance, Zheng et al 23 reported a significant positive association of shortness of breath/dyspnea with COVID-19 progression to severe illness and death. Additionally, a metaanalysis study reported similar findings and recommended dyspnea rather than fever as an indicator of poor outcome in COVID-19 patients. 24 The use of CT for the diagnosis of viral pneumonia allows patients with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection to be isolated and treated in time for recovery, thus optimizing patient management. 25 The results of the current study showed a significantly high frequency of bilateral peripheral GGO among patients with mild to moderate COVID-19, while in those with severe/critical infection, their CT chest revealed a crazy-paving appearance. Additionally, CT chest findings were a significant predictor for the severity of COVID-19 infection. Pan et al 26 reviewed 21 confirmed COVID-19 patients. They noticed the rapid growth of GGOs into crazy-paving appearance as the disease progresses, with its disappearance in the absorption stage, concluding that crazy-paving pattern could be considered as one of the indices that could be used to evaluate the course of the disease. Similar findings were reported by Song et al. 27 Also, in line with our findings are Wang et al 22 and Majidi and Niksolat. 28 In the present study, we analyzed the hematological indices of the included COVID-19-patients and revealed significantly lower mean values of WBCs and lymphocytic count among severely infected patients than those had mild to moderate COVID-19. Additionally, lymphopenia was significantly associated with the severity of COVID-19. In accordance, both Fan et al 29 and Li and Fan 30 reported lymphocytopenia among most COVID-19 patients on admission and leucopenia. Lymphopenia has been well described in a retrospective analysis of patients in Hong Kong and Singapore afflicted with SARS-CoV in 2003 and was associated with adverse outcome and ICU stay. 31 Although the cytokine profile and the dynamic lymphocytic changes and their relation to COVID-19 severity are still not understood, some of the severely infected patients exhibited significant lymphocytopenia and neutrophilia with decreased T cells particularly CD8+ type and raised cytokines (IL-2, -6 and -10, and interferon-\u03b3) than those had mild infection, with the subsequent gradual normalization of such parameters among severely infected survivors. This indicates that the neutrophil/CD8+ Tcell ratio is a powerful prognostic factor in COVID-19. Additionally, lymphopenia was noticed more in severe than mild infection and was associated with disease severity. 32 It has been reported that viral infection could induce a severe immunological reaction in the host, known as a cytokine storm, which is an acute systemic inflammatory syndrome characterized by fever and multiple organ dysfunction. Additionally, viral infection induces acute phase reactant production. 33 Our findings revealed significantly higher acute phase reactants (CRP, ESR, and ferritin) among severely COVID-19 patients when compared with those who have mild to moderate infection and were significantly associated with COVID-19 severity. These findings were in agreement with many studies. 10, 30, 34 Binding and storage of iron are functions of ferritin which are also associated with immune and inflammatory responses. 35 The increase in the serum ferritin levels following bacterial or viral infection could be attributed to iron release into the reticuloendothelial system, and increased intracellular ferritin synthesis and release, with the decreased ability of ferritin transport into spleen and liver. 36 Human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) receptor binding is one of the mechanisms by which COVID-19 can invade the human body with subsequent increased expression of ACE-2 in hepatocytes. 37 In the present study, there were significantly higher mean serum values of both ALT and AST with significantly lower serum levels of total proteins and albumin among severely infected COVID-19 patients vs those who had mild to moderate infection. Additionally, we reported that raised ALT and AST serum levels and low serum albumin levels were significantly associated with COVID-19 severity. Hepatic dysfunction in SARS-CoV-2 infection was reported for the first time by Chen et al, 38 who noticed increased serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) serum levels in 43.4% of COVID-19 cases from Wuhan, with mild elevation in most of them. Recently, a strong reasonable relation between abnormal liver biochemistries and SARS-CoV-2 infection severity has been highlighted. 30 In a study in Shanghai, severe to critical cases exhibited significantly higher serum ALT and AST levels than those who had mild to moderate COVID-19. 39 Similar findings were reported by other studies. 17, 40 Conclusion This is the first retrospective Egyptian study describing patients' characteristics and predictors of severity in SARS-CoV-2 infection. It revealed that older age and non-Egyptian persons are more vulnerable to severe COVID-19. Additionally, CT chest findings, leucopenia, lymphocytopenia, raised CRP, ESR, ferritin, and liver enzymes significantly occurred more with severe than mild to moderate COVID-19. Finally, among the studied demographic, clinical, hematological, biochemical, and imaging data, leucopenia, raised ALT and CT chest findings could be considered as predictors for COVID-19 severity
