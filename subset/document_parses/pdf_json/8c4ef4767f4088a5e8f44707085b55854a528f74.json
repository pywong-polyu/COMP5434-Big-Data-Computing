            "text": "After their assembly by budding into the lumen of the intermediate compartment (IC) at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-Golgi interface, coronaviruses (CoVs) are released from their host cells following a pathway that remains poorly understood. The traditional view that CoV exit occurs via the constitutive secretory route has recently been questioned by studies suggesting that this process involves unconventional secretion. Here, using the avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) as a wellestablished model virus, we have applied confocal microscopy to investigate the pathway of CoV egress from epithelial Vero cells. We report a novel effect of IBV infection on cellular endomembranes, namely, the compaction of the pericentrosomal endocytic recycling compartment (ERC) defined by the GTPase Rab11, which coincides with the previously described Golgi fragmentation, as well as virus release. Despite Golgi disassembly, the IC elements containing the major IBV membrane protein (M)-which mostly associates with newly formed virus particles-maintain their close spatial connection with the Rab11-positive endocytic recycling system. Moreover, partial colocalization of the M protein with Rab11 was observed, whereas M displayed negligible overlap with LAMP-1, indicating that IBV egress does not occur via late endosomes or lysosomes. Synchronization of virus release using temperature-shift protocols was accompanied by increased colocalization of M and Rab11 in vesicular and vacuolar structures in the pericentrosomal region and at the cell periphery, most likely representing IBV-containing transport carriers. In conclusion, these results add CoVs to the growing list of viruses exploiting the endocytic recycling apparatus defined by Rab11 for their assembly and/or release.",

            "text": "Instead of obtaining their membrane by budding at the cell surface-like, for example, influenza viruses-certain enveloped RNA and DNA viruses, such as bunya-, corona-, flavi-, toga-and herpesviruses, assemble by budding into the lumen of intracellular organelles, including the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), the intermediate compartment (IC) , and the Golgi apparatus (Griffiths and Rottier 1992; Hernandez-Gonzalez et al. 2021; Saraste and Prydz 2021) . Such an intracellular mode of multiplication requires that the progeny viruses are ultimately packaged into specialized transport carriers, which move towards the plasma membrane (PM) and undergo exocytosis, thereby resulting in virus release. Since these viruses form within compartments engaged in the secretory pathway, it has been generally assumed that their delivery to the extracellular space depends on constitutive secretion. This could also explain why the mechanisms of virus egress have received relatively little attention. However, the findings that these viruses typically cause an extensive reorganization of the Golgi apparatus have questioned the idea that their cellular exit involves conventional Golgi passage (Ruch and Machamer 2012; Saraste and Prydz 2021) .",

On the basis of the detection of progeny CoVs at the dilated rims of Golgi cisternae, it was originally concluded that following their exit from the IC (\"budding compartment\") the virus particles proceed across the Golgi stacks to reach the trans-Golgi network (TGN), where they are packaged into post-Golgi carriers for further delivery to the PM (Tooze et al. 1987; Salanueva et al. 1999; Machamer 2013) . This concept on CoV release via constitutive secretion gained support from subsequent work, including recent studies of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 (Siu et al. 2008; Bracquemond and Muriaux, 2021; Eymieux et al. 2021; Mendon\u00e7a et al. 2021) . However, evidence has also been presented that CoVs, such as SARS-CoV-2, can be released from their host cells in a Golgi-independent manner by employing lysosomal secretion (Ghosh et al. 2020) . Moreover, we recently proposed that the cellular exit of CoVs could involve an unconventional secretory pathway based on a direct functional connection between the IC and the endocytic recycling system (Saraste and Prydz 2021) . In fact, the endocytic recycling apparatus defined by the GTPase Rab11 is known to play an important role in the assembly and/or release of a number of enveloped viruses budding either intracellularly or at the cell surface (Bruce et al. 2012; Vale-Costa and Amorim 2016; Lucin et al. 2018 ), encouraging examination of its possible participation in the late stages of the CoV life cycle.",

For the preparation of virus stocks, Vero cells grown in two 10-cm-diameter culture dishes were washed with serum-free DMEM and infected with IBV diluted in the same medium to give a low multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.1 plaque-forming units (PFU)/cell. After 60 min incubation in a CO 2 incubator at 37 \u00b0C, the virus was removed and 6 ml DMEM containing 2% FCS was added to each plate. Incubation of the infected cultures was continued for up to 20 h until the formation of syncytia was observed by phase-contrast microscopy. At harvest, the dishes were covered tightly with Parafilm and subjected to three rounds of freezing (\u221280 \u00b0C freezer) and thawing (37 \u00b0C warm plate) to also collect the intracellular progeny viruses. After careful mixing, the virus-containing homogenates were transferred into 15 ml tubes, vortexed extensively, and centrifuged for 15 min at 2000 rpm. The supernatants were divided into 250 \u00b5l and 500 \u00b5l aliquots and stored in a \u221280 \u00b0C freezer. The virus stocks reached titers of up to 1 \u00d7 10 7 PFU/ml. Initially, the number of infected cells on the glass coverslips prepared for microscopy was low (about 20%) and variable between experiments. Therefore, to increase the efficiency of infection, two modifications were introduced. First, addition of the virus in a small volume (50 \u00b5l) just on top of the coverslips allowed long-term use of the same virus stock at a relatively high MOI (up to 2 PFU/cell). Second, virus adsorption was carried out at low temperature by keeping the coverslip-containing six-well plates for 60 min on ice, prior to their placement in the 37 \u00b0C incubator for another 60 min. In combination, these modifications gave a > 2.5-fold increase in the efficiency of infection-that is, infection of more than 50% of the cells.",

Since the widespread Rab11 signal at the same time diminished (compare Fig. 4b and f ), this dramatic change is most likely based on MT motor-dependent pericentrosomal accumulation of REs derived from the cell periphery and the fragmenting Golgi ribbon (see below; Saraste and Prydz, 2019; Fujii et al. 2020) . Similar results were obtained using antibodies against the TfR (data not shown); however, in this case, the number of cells showing ERC compaction did not increase to the same extent as seen using Rab11 as the marker (Fig. 5c) , possibly owing to an effect of IBV infection on the endocytic cycling of this PM receptor.",

Bar, 10 \u03bcm compare the time course of the two virus-induced alterations of the endomembrane system-ERC compaction and Golgi fragmentation-which both were easy to identify (compare uninfected and infected cells in Fig. 5a and  b) . Besides anti-Rab11, we used antibodies against p58/ ERGIC-53 and GM130, two commonly employed markers that localize to cis-Golgi cisternae (Saraste et al. 1987; Schweitzer et al. 1988; Nakamura et al. 1995; Saraste and Marie 2018) , thus helping to determine the state of the Golgi ribbon (Fig. 5b) . Interestingly, the two processes followed very similar kinetics and by 12-14 hpi were detectable in the majority (up to 85%) of the IBV-infected cells (Fig. 5c) . It should also be noted that the observed kinetics of Golgi fragmentation and ERC compaction resemble that of virus release (Fig. 1a) , suggesting that these processes are intimately related. Supporting this conclusion, quantitation of cells costained for Rab11 and the cis-medial-Golgi enzyme GalNAc-transferase 2 (GalNT2) (Fig. 5d) showed that about 80% of cells with ERC compaction also displayed Golgi fragmentation, with the former alteration helping to unambiguously identify the infected cells.",

Notably, imaging of IBV-infected cells during prophase verified that the M-protein-containing IC membranes and the Rab11-positive ERC still remain associated with the centrosome, as it relocates to underneath the nucleus, forming a distinct \"nuclear pocket\" (Fig. 7) . Moreover, partial colocalization of the M protein and Rab11 could be observed in punctate structures close to the compact pericentrosomal ERC, as well as at the cell periphery (Fig. 7) .

However, return of cells back to 37 \u00b0C led to rapid MHV release, showing that the low-temperature effect is readily reversible (Tooze et al. 1988 ). This study motivated us to assess whether similar temperature-shift experiments could be employed to study the egress of IBV from epithelial Vero cells. For this purpose, following the incubation of IBV-infected cells for 6 or 8 h at 37 \u00b0C, some of the cultures were shifted for 2-6 h to 31 \u00b0C, whereafter some were returned back to physiological temperature (37 \u00b0C). Samples were collected from the growth medium at the end of the incubations and subjected to plaque titration to determine the amounts of infectious virus released. Notably, results similar to those reported for MHV (Tooze et al. 1988) were obtained also in the case of IBV (Fig. 9a) , encouraging us to apply these temperature manipulations to obtain also better synchronization of the intracellular events leading to IBV release. Fig. 6 Partial colocalization of the M protein and Rab11 in IBVinfected cells. The cells were fixed at 8 hpi and double-stained with antibodies against the M protein (a-c) and Rab11 (d-f) for imaging by CM. The nuclei were visualized by DAPI staining. As indicated by their Rab11 staining patterns, the three cells appear to display variable degrees of ERC compaction (f, open arrowhead). Note the codistribution and partial colocalization of the two proteins in the pericentrosomal Golgi region, as well as in some peripheral structures (white arrowheads). Bar, 5 \u03bcm Fig. 7 Colocalization of the M protein (a) and Rab11 (b) during early mitosis. The cells were fixed at 8 hpi and costained for the M protein and Rab11. Nuclear DNA staining by DAPI reveals chromosome condensation (c), indicating that the cell has entered prophase. Owing to centrosome motility at prophase, the M-protein-containing IC elements and the Rab11-positive ERC have repositioned underneath the nucleus, forming a distinct nuclear pocket (c, asterisk). The two proteins codistribute and partially colocalize both in the pericentrosomal region as well as in punctate structures at the periphery of the mitotic cell (panels a, b and d; white arrowheads). Bars, 5 \u03bcm Importantly, compared with cells fixed at steady state (Fig. 6) , the temperature-shift protocols markedly increased the colocalization of the IBV M protein and Rab11 (Fig. 9b-d) , as shown by the quantifications in Fig. 10 . However, the extent of colocalization was highly variable between the different cells (Fig. 10) , suggesting that the intracellular synchronization achieved correlates with the stage of virus infection. Moreover, CM revealed that incubation at 31 \u00b0C, particularly when adopted early during infection, accelerates Golgi fragmentation (Fig. 9b-d) . Interestingly, the increased overlap of the M protein and Rab11 affected both large punctate structures, predominantly present in the perinuclear Golgi region, as well as smaller vesicular elements at the cell periphery, close to the PM (Fig. 9b-d) . On the basis of their differential localization, it is likely that these punctate Rab11-positive elements of variable size correspond to the large and small CoV-containing carriers described by previous EM studies (Tooze et al. 1987; Ulasli et al. 2012; Ruch and Machamer 2011; Eymieux et al. 2021 ).",

Subsequent studies have highlighted novel roles of the REs/ERC in intracellular trafficking: for example, in membrane delivery to phagosomes and autophagosomes (Murray et al. 2005; Husebye et al. 2010; Longatti et al. 2012; Puri et al. 2018) , and communication of these compartments with the Golgi apparatus (Wilcke et al. 2000; Taguchi 2013) . In fact, it turns out that numerous newly synthesized proteins traverse the endocytic recycling system during their delivery to the PM (Ang et al. 2004; Lock and Stow 2005; Cresawn et al. 2007; Misaki et al. 2010 ). Since previous studies had revealed that the Rab11-positive post-Golgi REs are functionally connected with the pre-Golgi IC Bowen et al. Fig. 9 Blocking virus release by low temperature (31 \u00b0C) incubation increases the colocalization of the IBV M protein and Rab11 after return of cells to physiological temperature (37 \u00b0C). a The virusinfected cells grown at 37 \u00b0C were shifted at 6 or 8 hpi for various time periods (4-6 h) to 31 \u00b0C, followed by return to 37 \u00b0C. Medium samples taken at the indicated timepoints were subjected to plaque titration to determine the amounts of infectious virus released. b, c Double-staining for the M protein and Rab11 of cells shifted at 6 hpi for 2 h to 31 \u00b0C, followed by return for 30 min to 37 \u00b0C. Despite considerable Golgi fragmentation caused by the low-temperature incubation, the proteins show considerable colocalization in large punctate structures in the Golgi region, highlighted by the insets (arrowheads). Also note the Rab11-positive RE clusters surrounded by M-proteincontaining IC elements (right insert, arrows). The ERC is indicated by the open arrowheads in c and d. Interestingly, the M protein and Rab11 also colocalize in punctate structures of variable size present at the cell periphery (arrowheads), even close to the cell surface (dashed lines in d). Bar, 5 \u03bcm 2017; Saraste and Marie 2018; Kennedy and Hanus 2019), it was tempting to suggest that CoVs make use of such a direct IC-RE link for their cellular exit, instead of taking the conventional secretory route (Saraste and Prydz 2021) . The large size of CoVs as secretory cargo, and their significant impact on Golgi organization (Machamer 2013 ) may also call for their unconventional secretion via the endosomal recycling system, a proposal that has gained experimental support from the present study.",

For example, the ERC is intimately involved in the biogenesis of the assembly compartment of cytomegalovirus, belonging to herpesviruses (Lu\u010din et al. 2018) . Regarding RNA viruses, Rab11dependent pathways have been implicated in the release filoviruses, such as Ebola virus (Nanbo and Ohba 2018) , and hepatitis C virus-a flavirus, which buds into the ER lumen (Coller et al. 2012; Bunz et al. 2021) . Bunyaviruses, which, like CoVs, assemble by budding at IC/Golgi membranes (J\u00e4ntti et al. 1997 )-and thus are also likely to share their mode of egress-follow a Rab11-dependent pathway during their transport from the pericentrosomal region to the extracellular space (Rowe et al. 2008) . The assembly of retroviruses also starts intracellularly via the association of both viral capsids-consisting of gag proteins and the genomic RNA-and envelope proteins with the ERC, followed by their MT-dependent transport to the PM, where virus assembly by budding is completed (Pereira et al. 2014; Kirschman et al. 2018) . Similarly, to support their budding at the PM, ribonucleoproteins (vRNPs) of orthomyxo-(e.g., respiratory syncytial virus) and myxoviruses (e.g., influenza virus)-containing the viral RNA genomes-associate with the ERC membranes to be delivered to the cell surface in RE carriers moving along MT tracks (Amorim et al. 2011; Eisfeld et al. 2011; Bruce et al. 2012) .",

            "text": "Obviously, our results raise numerous questions regarding the mechanisms and significance of the ERC compaction taking place in IBV-infected cells. However, recent studies of influenza virus may provide some answers. Namely, Kawaguchi and coworkers discovered that viral infection of HeLa cells induces Rab11 activation and increases MT nucleation, owing to cell-cycle-independent maturation of the centrosome (Kawaguchi et al. 2015) . As a consequence, cholesterol-rich REs accumulate at the pericentrosomal ERC, giving rise to a similar compaction of this compartment as described in the present study. In addition, the authors provided evidence for the formation of cholesterolrich domains (\"lipid rafts\") within the ERC that, by triggering membrane association of the vRNPs, initiate virus assembly (Kawaguchi et al. 2015) . Interestingly, it has been recently reported that similar formation of cholesterol-rich nanodomains around the excessively acylated spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2 drives virus budding at IC membranes, which normally display a low cholesterol content (Mesquita et al. 2021 ). Therefore, it is possible that compaction of the ERC, by maintaining an intimate connection between the REs and the expanding IC after Golgi disassembly, is required not only for virus egress, but also to boost lipid exchange between these compartments to support virus budding at specific IC subdomains.",

            "text": "In conclusion, our results provide the first evidence that CoVs-like many other enveloped viruses, budding either intracellularly or at the cell surface-employ the endocytic recycling compartments defined by Rab11 to gain exit from their host cells. Indeed, by harnessing the functional connection between the IC elements and REs at the cell center, influenza viruses and CoVs may have adopted similar replication strategies without sharing the same site of assembly. However, since the present and previous studies provide conflicting data on the role of the endocytic and secretory compartments in CoV egress (Tooze et al. 1987; Ulasli et al. 2012; Ghosh et al. 2020; Bracquemond and Muriaux 2021; Eymieux et al. 2021; Prydz and Saraste 2022) , future work employing various EM techniques and addressing the effects of organelle inhibitors, such as Brefeldin A (Ghosh et al. 2020) , on CoV release is required to settle this issue. For the moment, the possibility cannot be ruled out that different CoVs favor alternative routes depending on the host cell or tissue.",
