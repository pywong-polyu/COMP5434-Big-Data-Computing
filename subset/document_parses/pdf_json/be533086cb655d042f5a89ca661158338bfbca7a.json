Less attention has been given to evaluating statistical relationships between the number of positive tests and the number of tests performed. Statistical interrogation of positive test frequency in the current frenzy of test analyses could provide clues to aspects of the current crisis that would better guide response strategies and policy. In particular, such analyses may inform an emerging question regarding the natural history of CoV-19 in human populations. Namely, the possibility that the virus is not new to human populations; but has only now come into awareness and detection because of events occurring recently in Wuhan, China (1). This issue is particularly important for attention in situations like the present, when non-clinical measures of disease incidence dominate epidemiological assessments.",

The countries that deviate the most from the axis of the data in Fig. 1B include Spain (Sp), Italy (I), and the United States (US), showing the highest positive test frequencies at 56.6%, 20%, and 13.4%, respectively, compared, for instance, to South Korea (SK) at 2.7%. Examples of countries differing with lower positive test frequencies are Australia (A) and Russia (R), with frequencies of 0.14% and 0.61%, respectively. These deviations indicate that other important factors may act in these particular countries, including differences in the rate of CoV-19 spread. However, factors related to testing quality could also be responsible, including test specificity in the case of higher positive test frequencies and test sensitivity in the case of lower positive test frequencies.",

The mean positive test frequency is 13.4% ( Fig. 1C ; p < 0.0001; 95% CI 10.6% to 16.2%; median = 10%), equivalent to the value from WHO data. However, based on the Pearson correlation coefficient, 86% of the variance can be explained by differences in the number of tests performed (Fig. 1D) . It seems unlikely that such a high correlation, uniformly across the continental U.S., could be explained by CoV-19 spread from the event in Wuhan. Even the states of New Jersey (NJ) and New York (NY), which have apparently distinctively higher positive test frequencies, can be accounted for by chance occurrence within the log-normal distributions observed for the positive test frequency data ( Fig. 1A and Fig. 1C) .",

The second possible factor is a significant frequency of CoV-19 in the U.S. population prior to the event in Wuhan, China. Analyses of archival specimens, in particular with newly available CoV-19 antibody testing, and increased diligence to quantify better CoV-19 testing statistics and test quality measures are needed to evaluate this critical possibility. If these factors are significantly active, they will lead to misinterpretation of current epidemiological data with highly consequential policy missteps. ",
