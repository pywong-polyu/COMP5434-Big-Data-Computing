Constraints in vaccine supply and distribution capacity, together with the rise of COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations, have sparked a policy debate on whether to vaccinate more individuals with the first dose of available vaccines and delay the second dose, or to continue with the recommended two-dose series as tested in clinical trials. We developed an agent-based model of COVID-19 transmission to compare the impact of these two vaccination strategies, while varying the temporal waning of vaccine efficacy against disease following the first dose, vaccine efficacy against infection, and the level of pre-existing immunity in the population. Our results show that for Moderna vaccines with 80% efficacy following the first dose, a delay of 9-12 weeks could enhance the program effectiveness and prevent additional infections, hospitalizations, and deaths, compared to a 4-week interval between the doses. However, for Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines with demonstrated efficacy of 52% after the first dose, there was no clear advantage for delaying the second dose beyond the 3-week tested schedule, unless the efficacy of the first dose did not wane over time. Our findings underscore the importance of quantifying the durability of vaccine-induced protection after the first dose as well as vaccine efficacy against infection in order to determine the optimal time interval between the two doses.",

Broader population-level protection against COVID-19 in a delayed second dose (DSD) strategy, even with lower individual-level efficacy from the first dose in the short term, may improve the impact of vaccination compared to the recommended two-dose strategy that provides more complete protection to a smaller subset of the population [6, 9] .

We determined the optimal timing for administering the second dose based on the trade-offs between potential temporal decline in efficacy of the first dose against infection and disease, and the maximum protection level conferred by a DSD. For Moderna's two-dose vaccine, we show that a DSD strategy would significantly outperform the recommended 28-day interval between doses in terms of reducing the number of infections, hospitalizations and deaths. However, such benefits with Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines depend on the level of pre-existing immunity and the efficacy of the first dose over time.",

Those who did not develop symptomatic disease remained asymptomatic until recovery, with an infectious period that was sampled from a Gamma distribution with a mean of 5 days [21, 22] .

Challenges with vaccine supply and rollout, coupled with a deadly wave of outbreaks which has overwhelmed hospitals [38] [39] [40] , and the emergence of highly transmissible SARS-CoV-2 variants [41] [42] [43] , have sparked a debate as to whether available vaccines should be used to rapidly increase the coverage with the first dose, as a single-dose strategy in the near term [6] [7] [8] [9] . While the US has committed to delivering the second dose on-time for those who receive the first dose [44] , a few countries have approved guidelines for DSD, including Canada and the UK to defer the second dose by up to 6 and 12 weeks, respectively [45, 46] .",

Under the assumption of waning efficacy for only the first dose over time, our results show that for Moderna vaccines, DSD vaccination with a delay of 9-12 weeks could enhance the program effectiveness by preventing additional infections and adverse outcomes, compared to a 4-week interval between the two doses ( Figure 1 ). DSD with Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines beyond the 3-week tested schedule, on the other hand, may lead to a higher number of infections. However, depending on the level of pre-existing immunity, additional hospitalizations and deaths could be averted with DSD as a result of vaccine prioritization for individuals at higher risk of severe outcomes. We found that if the efficacy of the first dose did not wane until the administration of the second dose, then DSD for both Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines is more effective than their recommended schedules ( Figure 2 ).",
