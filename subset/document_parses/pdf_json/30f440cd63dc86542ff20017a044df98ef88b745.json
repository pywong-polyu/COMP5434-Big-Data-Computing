In developing nations, this can be compounded by logistical challenges, such as vaccine shortages and poor road infrastructure. To provide guidance towards improved epidemic response, various resource allocation models, in conjunction with a network-based SEIRVD epidemic model, are proposed in this article. Further, the feasibility of using drones for vaccine delivery is evaluated, and assorted relevant parameters are discussed. For the sake of generality, these results are presented for multiple network structures, representing interconnected populations-upon which repeated epidemic simulations are performed. The resource allocation models formulated maximise expected prevented exposures on each day of a simulated epidemic, by allocating response teams and vaccine deliveries according to the solutions of two respective integer programming problems-thereby influencing the simulated epidemic through the SEIRVD model. These models, when compared with a range of alternative resource allocation strategies, were found to reduce both the number of cases per epidemic, and the number of vaccines required. Consequently, the recommendation is made that such models be used as decision support tools in epidemic response. In the absence thereof, prioritizing locations for vaccinations according to susceptible population, rather than total population or number of infections, is most effective for the majority of network types. In other results, fixed-wing drones are demonstrated to be a viable delivery method for vaccines in the context of an epidemic, if sufficient drones can be promptly procured; the detrimental effect of intervention delay was discovered to be significant. In addition, the importance of well-documented routine vaccination activities is highlighted, due to the benefits of increased pre-epidemic immunity rates, and targeted vaccination.",

As international travel increases, so does the spread of microorganisms; including those causing life threatening diseases. Despite routine vaccination campaigns making significant inroads into attaining worldwide herd immunity for many infectious diseases, the risk of epidemics remains-particularly for previously unknown diseases. It is essential that governments and humanitarian aid organisations respond to outbreaks with maximal efficiency, to reduce the loss of life. When such responses to epidemics involve the administration of vaccines, response teams and vaccines need to be allocated to affected areas in a sensible manner. This allocation should take into account the impact of proposed vaccinations in each area on the spread of the epidemic, as well as the opportunity cost of not allocating resources to other affected areas.",

The recent advent of drone technology has promising applications in this regard, since it enables faster vaccine delivery, and deliveries to areas unreachable by land. Drone deliveries can also possibly curb the spread of an epidemic by reducing human interaction. Since approximately only one quarter of roads in Sub-Saharan Africa are paved [1] , and many can be impassable in rainy seasons, drones are a particularly attractive prospect for vaccine deliveries to these hard-to-reach areas, which often have low vaccination rates.",

In a similar vein, Vitoriano et al. [4] created a goal programming formulation of the problem of humanitarian aid resource distribution, accounting for objectives including cost and response time. Zaric and Brandeau [5] presented a dynamic investment allocation model with heuristics, with the objective of maximising certain health benefits. In previous related work, Zaric and Brandeau [6] also developed an investment allocation model, in conjunction with a compartmental epidemic model, to maximise \"life years gained or the number of new infections averted. Duijzer et al. [7] attempted to maximise the same metric; namely, the \"total number of people who escape infection,\" by allocating a constrained vaccine stockpile between multiple regions, according to what they term a \"dose-optimal vaccination fraction.\" This fraction, determined for each region, maximises the total number of averted infections per vaccine dose assigned. Mbah and Gilligan [8] also focused on resource allocation between multiple regions, and proposed candidate allocation strategies for optimality, based upon necessary conditions derived using the Pontryagin maximum principle.",

This heuristic determines the best vaccine allocations in a network of locations, for each day in the future until a predetermined point, maximising the total number of averted infections by switching batches of vaccine doses between regions. Additionally, they discussed a \"greedy heuristic,\" where vaccines are allocated to locations according to the largest marginal benefit arising per vaccine, where the benefit is averted infections.",

In this section, a resource allocation model is presented, for response team allocation between multiple subpopulations within a network. An integer programming problem is solved on each simulated day, to maximise expected prevented exposures (EPE) for the following day, by assigning teams to locations according to the highest marginal benefit arising from each assignment. This allows the allocation of teams to be dynamically adjusted as the epidemic progresses, ensuring that the allocation remains effective. This dynamic approach, and the objective of minimising total cases by considering the marginal benefit of allocations, is similar to that of Teytelman and Larson's telescope-to-the-future and greedy heuristics for vaccine allocation [13] . However, in this article, response teams and drone deliveries (under the constraint of limited delivery time) are allocated, instead of vaccines (under the constraint of a limited vaccine stockpile and uncertainty about future stock). Allocating deliveries, instead of simply vaccine stock, takes time into account-which ensures that delivery time is most effectively used in the critical first few days and weeks of an epidemic intervention. Another difference of note is that these allocations are performed in multiple generic network structures with heterogeneous population distributions. Their approaches can be seen as higher-level vaccine allocation strategies, perhaps to regions within a country, whereas the strategies in this article are more focused towards the actual delivery of vaccines to allocated response teams at points of dispensing.",

More specifically, such a disease is exclusively transmitted through interpersonal contact, has a latent period prior to contagiousness, and results in either death or permanent immunity upon recovery. The parameters appearing in Eqs (1)- (6), such as the daily transmission rate, death rate, and daily proportion of infectious individuals recovering, govern the progression of the disease. For all results in this article, except where otherwise stated, the values used for these parameters are set to simulate the spread of measles-and are listed in Table 1 , along with other default parameter values. In order to simulate another disease, alternate values for these parameters must be estimated from literature, or from data about the progression of epidemics of that disease. The default team allocation strategy is pro-rata allocation proportional to total population, and the default vaccine delivery strategy prioritizes locations in order of descending population size. Untargeted vaccination and the monocentric network type are both used by default, unless otherwise stated. The epidemic model requires an input dataset containing information about a physical network of locations in a hypothetically affected area. This dataset contains Cartesian x-and ycoordinates and population sizes for each location in the network, as well as the number of (exposed, and infectious) index cases at the start of the simulation. The coordinates of each location are programmatically scaled such that the maximum distance between any two locations equals an adjustable parameter D, the diameter of the network. Euclidean distances between each pair of locations are calculated based on these coordinates. These distances are used to select the distribution centre (DC) in the manner described below, and to calculate the drone delivery times, from the DC to each location. The maximum flight range of a single drone is 160km [31] . Therefore, under the assumption that drones only deliver to a single location per flight, the single DC must be placed less than 80km away from all locations, if possible.",

Niamey has an approximately monocentric population distribution, and as such the monocentric network structure defined previously is used. In the actual intervention undertaken, children aged 6-59 months were targeted, as they are the most susceptible to measles. Therefore, the population values specified in the input dataset provided in S5 Table refer only to this age group, for which a vaccination rate of 70% is assumed-a total population of 160 000.

After performing a grid search with repeated simulations with a step size of 0.05, a value of R 0 = 7.00 was found to provide the best fit to the reported epidemic curve-and is thus used in the validation simulations.

Notably, for every team allocation strategy in this network besides EPE, the best delivery allocation strategy is EPE. This is followed by both delivery allocation strategies which prioritise locations by susceptible population. The worst-performing delivery allocation strategies in this network are those prioritising locations according to total population and number of infections. This is aligned with the findings of Mbah and Gilligan [8] , Teytelman and Larson [13] , and Duijzer et al. [7] , who all found the pro-rata population strategy to be inferior to other, perhaps less equitable, strategies. A likely hypothesis for the poor performance of the EPE team strategy, considering the superiority of the EPE delivery strategy, is the fact that the primary constraint on vaccinations when using the default parameter set is the amount of available delivery time, rather than the number of teams. Therefore, the selection of an appropriate delivery strategy is more important than that of a team strategy-especially when inefficient untargeted vaccination is employed. ",

Results are similar for the untargeted intervention also, although slightly less prominent. Therefore, particularly where targeted vaccination is used, and sufficient vaccine stock is available, the EPE team allocation strategy is superior to the other strategies considered; minimising both the number of cases, and vaccinations. Aside from the EPE strategy, it is clear that proportional team allocation according to susceptible population is most effective-particularly for reducing vaccine usage, while resulting in a similar, or lower, number of cases than other strategies. Allocating teams proportionally to total population also performs reasonably well, although results in more vaccines being used. Finally, allocating teams proportionally to the number of infections at each location appears to be a costly strategy, and is often less effective in reducing cases.

As both the number of days exposed and infectious increase, the number of cases reduce slightly; likely due to the epidemic progressing more slowly, allowing the intervention to be more timely and effective. As R 0 increases, the average number of cases also increases, as expected-albeit increasing at a reducing rate as R 0 rises. The final notable result is the apparent near-exponential growth in the number of vaccines administered as the average number of days exposed rises.

The second set of parameters investigated are those relating to the intervention itself; the number of working hours for deliveries and vaccinations per day, the number of daily vaccinations per response team, the delay before an epidemic is declared, and the delay between epidemic declaration and the start of the intervention. The sensitivities of both cases and vaccinations to changes in these parameters are plotted in Fig 7. The modelled effect of an increase in working hours is a proportional increase in daily vaccinations per team, as well as allowing more daily drone deliveries to be possible. Therefore, when either the daily working hours or the daily vaccinations per team is increased, the resultant near-identical slight reduction in cases is expected. The two most notable results for this parameter set are the respective impacts of epidemic detection delay, and intervention delay, on the number of cases. If the epidemic is detected earlier, there is a large reduction in the number of cases. The same applies for intervention delay after epidemic detection; the sooner the intervention, the fewer cases occur on average. Epidemic detection delay is near-impossible for decision-makers in an epidemic intervention to influence, and can only be reduced by more effective routine epidemic monitoring in healthcare systems. On the contrary, while difficult to reduce, the intervention delay is somewhat under the control of decision-makers. The effect of the intervention delay on the number of cases is so pronounced that, for each further day of delay (in the monocentric network), the number of cases in the epidemic increases by 1.5%, for the range considered. For the polycentric, city, and rural networks modelled, this daily increase in total cases is 0.4%, 0.6%, and 2.7%, respectively. These values were obtained as the respective slopes of least-squares linear regression approximations of each network's sensitivity plot for intervention delay, as depicted in Fig 8. It is clear that reducing the intervention delay, by even a single day, can make a large difference in the number of total cases and deaths in an epidemic. As this difference is most significant for rural networks, the use of drones to perform prompt deliveries to hard-to-reach locations is an even more attractive prospect.",

This reduction in marginal benefit, which is most pronounced for targeted interventions, indicates that the benefit of using an additional team in an intervention should be weighed against the marginal cost thereof. The effect of changes in the number of teams on vaccinations is, however, less intuitive. As expected, the addition of more teams results in slightly more vaccinations being possible, for both vaccination types. However, as the number of teams reduces, there is a sharp increase in the number of vaccines required for the untargeted intervention, while the targeted intervention's vaccinations continue to decrease. A likely hypothesis for this is that the reduction in teams, and ineffective untargeted vaccination, results in a failure to timeously control the epidemic. This perhaps-surprising result indicates that a failure to effectively control an epidemic initially may result in an increase in cost required to eventually do so.

Conversely, as the launch time per flight increases, the number of vaccinations reduces, and the number of cases increases. Although these results are expected, the extent to which these seemingly unimportant parameters affect the number of cases is notable. This is the case because, with a limited number of drones, every hour of delivery time is valuable. A 50% decrease of the flight launch time (from 10 minutes, to 5 minutes) results in more than a 5% increase in the number of vaccinations, and a reduction in total cases by over 2%. If the average speed per flight is reduced from 100km/h to 50km/h, the mean total number of cases per simulation increases by 2.4%. Similarly, if the number of vaccines delivered per flight is reduced from 60 to 30, the number of cases increases by 3.5%. These results indicate that, due to their increased speed, fixed-wing drones are more effective than quadcopter drones for prompt vaccine delivery-particularly for larger networks. It seems also that a sense of urgency must be maintained when performing deliveries, as every minute wasted can have an impact on the number of cases.

This is the case for all network types, although to varying extents; the efficiencies of the strategies considered appear somewhat inconsistent across network types. In the comparison of team allocation strategies, under the assumption of unlimited vaccine availability, the EPE team strategy performed above-average for all networks, for both targeted and untargeted interventions. In fact, for the former, the EPE strategy resulted in the minimum number of cases for all network types. Besides this, team allocation proportionally to total population and susceptible population were shown to be fairly effective strategies. Conversely, allocating teams uniformly, or proportionally to the number of infections per location, is ineffective, and results in an increased number of cases and vaccines required. When the vaccine delivery strategies were compared by aggregating results over the team strategies, the EPE delivery strategy was again found to be superior to the alternatives. With the exception of the rural network with untargeted vaccination, the EPE delivery strategy resulted in the minimum number of cases and vaccinations, for all networks and for both targeted and untargeted vaccination. Both delivery strategies prioritising locations according to susceptible population performed consistently well, whereas, in accordance with existing literature, the strategies prioritising total population and infections performed poorly, usually resulting in higher costs and more cases. It is important to note, though, that since the effectiveness of the strategies varies according to network type, it is important to consider a network's population distribution when making resource allocation decisions.",

Increases in both epidemic detection delay, and intervention delay, result in a notable increase in epidemic cases. For the latter, a single further day of delay was shown to increase cases by between 0.4% and 2.7%, depending on the network structure. The urgency of epidemic intervention is already well known, and this result confirms that notion. The impact of a failure to promptly control an epidemic, with insufficient response teams, was also demonstrated; with fewer teams, there are inevitably more cases, and an increase in cost when vaccination is untargeted. In addition to these conclusions, the importance of routine vaccination activities was highlighted by the result that, for each percentage point increase in the pre-epidemic vaccination rate within the range tested, there's a 3.32% decrease in the average number of epidemic cases.",

It is difficult to provide a general recommendation for how many drones should be used in an epidemic response, since this depends on the population, network type and drone capacity. For the fixed-wing drones and networks considered though, 15 drones appear to suffice for most population levels; although the more, the better.",

They are thus recommended for implementation in epidemic interventions. In the absence of such models, resource allocation according to susceptible population, rather than infections or total population, is best. Further, since targeted vaccination is superior to untargeted vaccination, and each day of intervention delay notably affects an epidemic's spread, a targeted intervention with minimal delay is advisable. Finally, fixed-wing drones are a viable option for vaccine delivery in an epidemic intervention, if a sufficient number of them are used-and may be tremendously helpful in areas with poor road infrastructure. The plots each give an indication of how the total network population progresses between the S, E, I, R, V, and D categories in that network. The monocentric network is top left, the polycentric network is top right, the city-type network is bottom left, and the rural-type network is bottom right. (TIF) S1 ",
