            "text": "Initial research on the pandemic indicates that SARS-CoV-2 infections occur more frequently in socioeconomically deprived areas. 1 Infection risks may accordingly be higher for people in disadvantaged living and certain working conditions, especially during more advanced stages of the pandemic. 2 3 For example, essential workers employed in the logistic, healthcare, retailing or public transport sector, who tend to have lower incomes than non-essential workers, 4 often work in conditions involving closer physical proximity to others. 5 The possibility to work remotely is, by contrast, more available to people with higher incomes and qualifications. 6 Furthermore, crowded living conditions and limited access to effective personal protective equipment may increase the risk of viral transmissions and thereby produce inequalities in infections. 7 Research on socioeconomic differences in SARS-CoV-2 infections has been based mostly on ecological studies correlating area-level infection rates with area-level socioeconomic indicators. 1 2 8 9 The advantage of ecological studies is that area-level data are available relatively quickly, for example, from existing surveillance systems. Ecological studies can thus be an expedient starting point for exploring the phenomenon. However, their findings are prone to ecological fallacy, areas can be very heterogeneous in terms of their residents' socioeconomic position (SEP) and inequalities are probably underestimated. Seroepidemiological individual-level studies are therefore needed to examine the relationship between SEP and SARS-CoV-2. In this study, we introduced serological and PCR testing along with a self-report questionnaire on previously conducted PCR tests into an existing German cohort and investigated whether SARS-CoV-2 infections were associated with SEP at the individual level.",

Participants provided a dried capillary blood sample obtained by finger prick to serologically detect antibodies from a previous SARS-CoV-2 infection by ELISA. To test for a current infection, participants provided an oral-nasal swab sample for PCR testing. Both specimens were collected by the participants themselves using CE-certified sample collection and submission kits sent by post along with written, pictorial and video instructions. A one-page paper questionnaire included questions on previous throat swab laboratory tests for SARS-CoV-2. Further details can be found in the study protocol. 11",

Cases were defined as those meeting at least one of these criteria (ie, if participants had missing data or were not positive on one criterion but were positive on another, they were considered as cases). Undetected infection with SARS-CoV-2 was defined as having tested seropositive or PCR-positive during the study but self-reported never having had a SARS-CoV-2-positive swab test before. SEP was measured using participants' self-reported prepandemic (and hence exogenous) education and income from SOEP wave 2019 or the latest available from earlier waves. Using the CASMIN (Comparative Analysis of Social Mobility in Industrial Nations) educational classification, 13 participants' highest school and vocational qualifications were classified into low (no, primary or low secondary education), middle (intermediate/high secondary education) and high (tertiary education). Equivalised current disposable household income was calculated using the OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development)-modified equivalence scale and categorised into low(<60%ofmedian),middle(60%\u2212<150%ofmedian)and high(\u2265150%ofmedian). 14",

The weighting factors result from complex non-response modelling at the person and household level and calibration of the sample to match the official German population statistics by age, sex, federal state, municipality size, household size and owner-occupied housing. Standard error (SE) estimation was performed using Stata's survey data commands (V.17.0, StataCorp LLC, College Station, Texas, USA) accounting for weighting and household clustering. Logistic regression models with household-clustered SEs were used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) for SARS-CoV-2 infections by SEP, adjusted for a set of covariates: age, sex, household size, migrant background, urban-rural residence, region (east/west), date of participation and dummy variables for missing values.",

Overall, 192 participants were seropositive, 51 were PCR positive and 146 self-reported having had a laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection before study participation (table 1) . At least one of these criteria was met by 288 participants. Table 2 shows the prevalence and adjusted ORs for SARS-CoV-2 infection by SEP. Seropositivity, seropositivity or PCR positivity and a self-reported positive swab test were each most prevalent in the lowest education and income groups. After adjusting for covariates, low education remained associated with seropositivity and the combined infection indicator of measured seropositivity or PCR positivity. A previously detected infection with SARS-CoV-2 as indicated by a self-reported positive swab test prior to the study showed no consistent association with either education or income. When all three infection parameters were combined (seropositive/PCR positive or previously tested positive), the OR for SARS-CoV-2 infection was 1.87fold higher in the low than high education group. Evidence was weaker for income differences in infections. With regard to undetected infections, highly educated adults had lower odds of being seropositive or PCR positive without previously having received a positive swab test result compared with adults with low as well as those with medium education, net of all covariates. The adjusted OR comparing high versus low/middle education was 0.45 (95% CI 0.22 to 0.93, p=0.031). ",

Completely non-random non-response could be counteracted by complex weighting, which enabled extrapolation to Germany's adult population in private households.

Selection bias may have occurred if individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection were more or less willing to participate in the study and if this varied by SEP. Depending on the direction of this potential effect, it may have led to overestimation or underestimation of SEP differences in infections.
