Research has highlighted several barriers to the use of technology in health settings, including the limited integration as a part of routine practice (Topooco et al., 2017) , resulting from clinicians' uncertainties about the availability of technologies and the technical aspects regarding privacy and security, reliability, and safety of use (Cliffe et al., 2020) .

In other occupational settings, remote working has been found to have a negative impact on workforce wellbeing, due to the collapsing of boundaries between work and private lives and reduced social interaction and relationships with colleagues (Grant et al., 2013) . For instance, in the context of a nationwide lockdown, working from home may mean that many staff members are required to balance the demands of work with caring responsibilities for vulnerable family members or providing education and care for dependents. Similarly, reduced social interactions and more distanced relationships with colleagues can potentially impose challenges in managing clinical risk effectively, providing high quality care, as well as in ensuring staff are adequately supported at times of change.",

It was evident that clinicians relied upon telephone contact with children and families rather than adopting new technologies such as video calls six weeks into the lockdown period of the pandemic. Interestingly, whilst there was no relationship between those with an underlying health condition and the degree of worry/adverse wellbeing experienced, those working from home 100% of the time were found to have higher levels of COVID related worry. One of the most striking findings related to the change in perceived competence of CAMHS clinicians, with the pandemic having a highly significant adverse effect on clinician's self-rated ability to establish rapport, assess risk, undertake an assessment, and provide an intervention remotely. Concordant with this, a substantial proportion of respondents reported being unable to undertake core aspects of their roles. Reports also highlighted the increased need for frequent contact with the team, and more importance placed on supervision and mechanisms of informal staff support. 3.5.2 | Being supported within the team A further pervasive theme across clinicians' narratives was the value of support provided by the team during the pandemic. Respondents frequently highlighted the benefits of informal support, including having a space to \"chat\" and \"check-in,\" and share \"mutual support and feeling for each other\" (Clinician 34). The opportunity to share light-hearted moments of interaction, including connecting through \"humour\" appeared to provide some balance to discussions related to COVID-19.

The current study was not able to establish the direct causal factors contributing to this for some clinicians. However, some inferences can be made from the qualitative analysis of clinicians' outstanding needs. The qualitative data suggested that, at the specified time-point in the pandemic, clinicians lacked the physical resources, training and guidance, as well as support to maximize their effectiveness in completing their role. As expected, there was a significant shift to remote working and offering clinical contacts to young people and families by telephone or video, with telephone calls being the predominant format of appointments. This could potentially offer a further explanation of perceived inability, as clinicians are less able to examine vital forms of nonverbal communication which are relied upon to form clinical impressions and maintain engagement (Reinhard & Sporer, 2008) . Furthermore, frequent or sustained use of videoconferencing platforms has been found to be more cognitively demanding than face-to-face interactions, with a greater potential for miscommunication and misattribution (Schoenenberg et al., 2014) .",

It may be that clinicians perceive the change in work competency as a shared experience with their colleagues, transitory and temporary, and outside of their locus of control, therefore limiting the impact on their selfesteem and wellbeing. It was, however, observed those working remotely for the entirety of their contracted hours reported experiencing significantly higher levels of COVID-19 worry than those working predominantly in the service base. One potential explanation posits that those working entirely remotely may have less exposure to the reality of the world during the pandemic and less connection with familiar routines, exacerbating levels of worry. Alternatively, those individuals reporting greater levels of COVID-19 worry may be more likely to have made the behavioral choice to stay at home, where possible.",

Similarly, there was no available WEMWBS data collected during a pandemic, limiting the ability of the current study to ascertain if CAMHS clinicians' reportedly low wellbeing was in the normative range given the global context. Although an online survey allows for timely collection of responses from larger numbers of individuals, the questions are static and are not able to evolve, as they can with interview methodologies, to elicit information about new lines of inquiry or encourage individuals to expand on their responses, therefore potentially reducing the richness of the qualitative data collected.",

The analysis identified five major themes which were labeled: (1) providing a service to young people and families, (2) being supported within the team, (3) working as a team, (4) working adaptations, and (5) needs of the team. A pictorial representation of the major themes and subthemes is presented in the provision of a continuing service and regular contact to families as a key subtheme. Another subtheme was the appreciation from families of being \"held in mind\" by CAMHS clinicians during a time of uncertainty. Flexibility in offering appointments remotely and choice in service provision was also important in the narratives of clinicians. Finally, a subtheme emerged around families' appreciation of the provision of additional resources during the pandemic including signposting to online material. \"I think [families] appreciate the fact that we're still open for business and looking to support them during a difficult time, even if remotely\u2026we give a message that we care about their mental health needs and haven't abandoned them.\" \"[Families value] our flexibility in working differently e.g. offering phone and video consultations in place of face-toface appointments.\" \"On the other hand, other families don't seem to want services at present. They seem to be experiencing less difficulties.\" \"[Families value] practical information they can use to understand what they might be experiencing and things that might help\u2026being given information and access to resources, groups and other people.\"",

The subtheme connecting with colleagues highlighted the importance of virtually maintaining relationships, however, some clinicians valued the physical, albeit socially distanced, contact with their co-workers. The final subtheme related to clinicians feeling understood by their colleagues with regard to the impact of personal circumstances on their ability to work.\"I appreciate the commitment shown by my colleagues to continue a service.\" \"[The daily team meeting] has been very much appreciated as an opportunity to connect with the wider team, and to retain a shared multi-disciplinary focus to our clinical work, at this time where we are working increasingly on an autonomous basis.\" \"[It is] good to see familiar faces whilst the staffing is distant at this time.\" \"I've appreciated the understanding from colleagues and at times management of the impact of this situation on us as human beings.\"",

The findings are also consistent with recent studies in the general population which have reported an increased rate of psychological distress during the pandemic(McGinty et al., 2020). It was somewhat surprising that no association was observed between the degree of worry related to the COVID-19 pandemic and clinicians' self-reported wellbeing. This association was, however, approaching significance, and may be an artifact of the nonparametric statistics employed in the quantitative analysis.Contrary to the extant literature investigating correlates of anxiety and stress in hospital workers during emerging virus outbreaks(Kisely et al., 2020), the current study found no associations with COVID-19 worry or wellbeing with relation to gender, age, preexisting health condition, living with children, years of clinical experience, or perceptions of the adequacy of PPE provision. The reasons for the lack of association between these factors are unclear.However, it does suggest that research investigating the psychological impact of the pandemic on frontline healthcare workers cannot be directly applied to mental health professionals. It is likely that a range of tertiary variables are associated with the high-levels of worry and adverse wellbeing amongst CAMHS workers, which include the possibility of factors external to the working environment.",
