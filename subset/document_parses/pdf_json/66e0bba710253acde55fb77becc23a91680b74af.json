Despite plentiful evidence characterizing the impact of drug shortages, there is a remarkable dearth of data describing current shortage management practices. Hospitals within the same state or region may not only take different approaches to shortages but may be unaware of shortages proximate facilities are facing. Our goal is to explore how hospitals in Michigan handle drug shortages to assess potential need for comprehensive drug shortage management resources. We conducted semi-structured interviews with diverse stakeholders throughout the state to describe experiences managing drug shortages, approaches to recent shortages, openness to inter-institutional engagement, ideas for a shared resource, and potential obstacles to implementation. To solicit additional feedback on ideas for a shared resource gathered from the interviews, we held focus groups with pharmacists, physicians, ethicists, and community representatives. Among participants representing a heterogeneous sample of institutions, three themes were consistent: (1) numerous drug shortage strategies occurring simultaneously; (2) inadequate resources and lead time to proactively manage shortages; and (3) interest in, but varied attitudes toward, a collaborative approach. These data provide insight to help develop and test a shared drug shortage management resource for enhancing fair allocation of scarce drugs. A shared resource may help institutions adopt accepted best practices and more efficiently access or share finite resources in times of shortage.

Drug shortages are caused by factors such as raw material shortages, regulatory influences, manufacturing difficulties, and financial implications [3, 4] . To year [5] Underlying economic, logistical, political, and regulatory causes have been well described and were recently summarized in a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) report [6, 7] . The COVID-19 pandemic has only exacerbated these problems related to both supply-side challenges as well as increased demand for medications used for critically ill patients [8] . Drug shortages frequently and persistently affect healthcare institutions, providers, and patients-posing formidable financial, logistical, and ethical challenges [9] . An estimated $416 million dollars are associated with the annual labor cost of managing drug shortages in the United States [10] . At least an additional $215 million are spent purchasing alternative medications annually not to mention the substantial costs incurred when institutions seek distribution from the pharmaceutical gray market as well [4, 11] . Drug shortages can also lead to increased risk of medication errors and adverse patient outcomes [12, 13] . Based on experience at our institution, these authors believe the financial and patient impact is likely much greater.",

Despite this, institutions rarely have the resources (time, information, and personnel) to follow the recommended pathways due to varying organizational cultures, decision-making processes, electronic health records, formularies, acuity levels, and inventory management practices. Due to the acute and dynamic nature of shortages, decisions may be made rapidly with only a few persons involved. Thus, little is known about how institutions and medical personnel make decisions regarding which patients should receive limited supplies of drugs or devices. In a national survey of pediatric hematologists/oncologists, nearly 65% of practitioners said they had patients directly affected by drug shortages. However, one-third did not know of a program or policy for handling drug shortages at their institution, and one-fourth did not know who makes decisions about drug allocation [15] . This illustrates a potential lack of transparency even within institutions, let alone across them.",

Several participants echoed that the maintenance of a resource would take significant effort and admitted the lack of automation related to their inventory records would make sharing supply-on-hand difficult. Therefore, the resource would need a simple way to input information initially and continually for further updates. Other participants suggested that difficulty in selling drug(s) to other institutions in the event of a surplus, even outside of shortage situations. Additionally, hospitals may have specific product discounts by qualifying for 340B purchases, generic discounts through GPOs, or other contracts. Hospitals would not be able to sell these medications to others from a legal perspective due to the proprietary information involved.

Additionally, community members were less familiar with the medication use process and drug shortage management, thus some of their discussion focused less on day to day management of drug shortages and more on external forces. Audio recording of each interview and focus group could lead to less frank answers, despite the anonymity maintained throughout the study. Interview and focus group participants derived from selected sample hospitals resulted in a small sample size and had little representation from critical access and non-urban hospitals. This leads to difficulty extrapolating statistically significant conclusions about drug shortage experiences, approaches, and ideas about a shared resource to underrepresented institution types. Overall, the size of the hospitals in the sample based on licensed hospital beds was relative small (majority having less than 500 beds). This may limit the applicability of our conclusions to states with larger hospital bed averages. However, this is generally reflective of the hospitals in the State of Michigan. Additionally, the majority of the hospitals represented were not-for-profit. Thus, strategies regarding drug shortages discussed may overshadow opportunities afforded to only for-profit sites. Participants only highlighted participation in GPOs, thus involvement with integrated delivery networks (IDNs) were not discussed and could be a potential opportunity to investigate in the future. Data collection preceded the COVID-19 pandemic, thus recorded drug shortage mitigation strategies may not be wholly consonant with current experience.",

Inaccuracies and lag-time of the current shortage lists suggest the need for realtime shortage information to be communicated to hospitals. Additionally, shortages tend to affect regions based on supply chain constraints, forcing clinicians to react to shortages in lieu of proactively managing drug shortages or inventory. Frequently, personal or professional networks help provide insight, and, less often, even product. Due to the legal complexities of drug borrowing/distribution, borrowing is often restricted to urgent/dire situations and never resolves the shortage. Standalone institutions, not part of a large GPO, and institutional leaders not involved in professional organizations, seem to have less opportunity for collaboration. This predicament highly suggests the need for a collaborative resource that is established on a regional or state-wide level.",

Thus, as drug shortage management often happens in concert across institutions, it would be beneficial for institutions to share not only information about drugs facing shortages, but also information regarding substitutions and clinical alternatives. Some national resources attempt to create online member-only forums, which tend to also include non-drug-related shortages and other clinical problems. However, these member-only opportunities isolate non-members and prevent full statewide/ regional collaboration. Any future resources created should be open to all drug shortage managers at institutions in a designated area, however, should be somewhat restricted to prevent non-drug shortage-related matters or membership should be monitored closely.",
