Methods: A national online bilingual American Sign Language/English survey was conducted from April 17 to May 1, 2020. Weighted sample of 474 DHH adults living in the United States. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted to examine independent associations of sociodemographic variables and health indicators with perceived COVID-19 health consequences. Results: About 44% of the medical condition sample used the Internet (English-based text) first for COVID-19 information, followed by TV (24%). Only 1% selected healthcare provider as the go-to source; the remainder got information from family or friends. Perceived health consequences increased with age (adjusted OR = 1.04; CI 95% = 1.02, 1.06). At-risk respondents who self-identified as persons of color were nearly three times more likely to believe that their health will be severely affected by COVID-19 compared to respondents who self-identified as white (adjusted OR = 2.94; CI 95% = 1.20, 7.18). Conclusions: Perception of COVID-19 health consequences vary among DHH adults at higher risk for severe illness. Practice implications: Information delivery methods must be flexible and comprehensive to meet the diverse community's needs, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic.",

            "text": "As a pandemic, COVID-19 continues to exert devastating health effects on the U.S. population [1] . Deaf and hard of hearing (DHH) American Sign Language (ASL) speakers comprise a group of approximately 500,000 individuals [2] , some of whom often encounter communication, language, information and healthcare barriers [3, 4] , as well as healthcare disparities including lower knowledge, healthcare utilization, and health literacy [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] . Even with a shared language (ASL), these individuals vary on how they identify themselves (e.g., Deaf, deaf, hard of hearing); we use the convention of \"deaf and hard of hearing\" in this article. Among DHH people who use ASL as their primary language and are less fluent in English, the isolation of public information to mostly English-based information sources places this marginalized DHH community at higher risk for misinformation and COVID-19 infection [11, 12] . A recent U.S. study showed that DHH people are diverse for preferences in accessing health information sources; DHH adults who self-reported ASL as their primary language preferred YouTube and social media for health information, while a lower percentage went to a doctor first for health information [13] . Those who cited the Internet as their first go-to source tended to be white, educated, and/or younger.",

These may include ongoing communication difficulties with healthcare providers, reductions in incidental and informal learning regarding COVID-19, and inadequate accessible COVID-related information in public health messaging and on the Internet [20] [21] [22] . Consequently, examining how DHH people, especially those considered at high risk for infection, seek COVID-19-related information merits urgent research attention to assist with patient education and communication planning. The authors hypothesized that DHH people seeking COVID-19 information would, in line with prior evidence, use online information predominately and exhibit lower preference for utilizing health care providers in this manner, and that perceived health consequences of COVID-19 infection would be relatively low, given disparities in information access.",

Even though all participants can communicate in ASL, participants varied on how they identified themselves (i.e., culturally Deaf, deaf, or hard of hearing). For this reason, we use \"DHH\" to include all of these identifications in our sample. After the participant viewed the study information in ASL and English online, the participant was directed to a page where they could choose to provide consent to voluntarily participate or decline.

This particular finding highlights the need to consider intersectional life experiences by regularly analyzing subgroups of people who identify as being part of multiple underserved communities (e.g., identifying as both POC and DHH). Reassuringly, respondents who were older were more likely to correctly identify themselves as higher risk [25, 27] . Younger people (e.g. in their twenties) with co-morbidities were less likely to identify themselves as at-risk, and with potential influences on respondent behavior (such as mask use and social distancing). The misperception of their risks is consistent with a recent COVID-19 study with 475 DHH adults; this study reported a strong association of fewer years of education with ineffectiveness of physical distancing and misperception of asymptomatic individuals as not being contagious [12] .",

In contrast, nearly 60% reported using internet resources, whether textbased in English or videos in ASL. This finding emphasizes the need to develop high-quality, timely information about COVID-19 via Internet-based avenues, while also pointing to the need for support and innovation to develop and implement stronger patient-physician relationships and accessibility for DHH patients; in other words, information development and delivery must be deployed along multiple avenues. These strategies should incorporate both English and ASL versions to increase their accessibility, regardless if they are web-based (e.g. captioned videos or easy to read graphics) or inperson communication (e.g. medical qualified interpreters). Such work could potentially better position physicians and other health care professionals as COVID-19 information sources for DHH communities.
