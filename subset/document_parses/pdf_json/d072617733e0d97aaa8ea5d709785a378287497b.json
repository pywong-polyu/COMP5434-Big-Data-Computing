Many serological tests are available and require urgent independent validation. Here, we report performance characteristics of Orient Gene Biotech COVID-19 IgG/IgM Rapid Test Cassette (OG) and compare it to Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG immunoassay (ASIA). Patients (n \u03ed 102) with a positive severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) were tested. The patients were asymptomatic (n \u03ed 2) or had mild (n \u03ed 37) or severe symptoms requiring hospitalization in a medical unit (n \u03ed 35) or intensive care unit (n \u03ed 28). Specificity was evaluated for 42 patients with previous viral and parasitic diseases as well as a high level of rheumatic factor. The sensitivity of OG was 95.8% (95% confidence interval [CI95%], 89.6 to 98.8) for samples collected \u054610 days after the onset of symptoms, which was equivalent to the sensitivity of ASIA of 90.5% (CI95%, 82.8 to 95.6). OG uncovered six false-negative results of ASIA, of which two had only IgM with OG. Specificity was 100% (CI95%, 93.4 to 100) with both tests on samples, including patients infected with endemic coronavirus. Overall, OG performance characteristics indicate that the test is suitable for routine use in clinical laboratories, and its performance is equivalent to that of immunoassay. Testing OG on a larger asymptomatic population may be needed to confirm these results.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "the test device, and two drops of sample buffer are immediately added to the buffer well (B). The result is read at 10 min. The cassette displays a blue control band that turns red when the test has been performed correctly. IgG and IgM are represented by two separate bands and are read visually. Whole-blood samples used in this study were centrifuged at 1,200 rpm for 20 min, and sera were aliquoted and stored at -20\u00b0C upon use. Serum samples (n \u03ed 106) were tested from 102 patients with positive SARS-COV-2 RT-PCR (Cobas SARS-CoV-2 test; Roche, Meylan, France) and at least 4 days (4 to 40; median, 18) after the onset of symptoms or positive PCR for asymptomatic patients. Negative samples tested (n \u03ed 42) were acquired during the prepandemic period from routine occupational health patients with no known disease (n \u03ed 14) or hospitalized patients (n \u03ed 28) with a previous pulmonary infection with endemic coronavirus (n \u03ed 16), rhinovirus (n \u03ed 1), metapneumovirus (n \u03ed 1), influenza A virus (n \u03ed 1), or syncytial respiratory virus (n \u03ed 1). Three patients had recent infection with malaria. Two patients had IgM antibodies (Ab) against cytomegalovirus, and 2 had IgM Ab against Epstein-Barr Virus. A few patients had IgG against HIV (n \u03ed 1), hepatitis B virus (n \u03ed 1), and toxoplasmosis (n \u03ed 1), and two patients had high levels of rheumatic factor. All OG test results were performed and read after 10 min by two clinical microbiologists unblinded regarding the sample group. Indeterminate readings were to be read by a third microbiologist. Concomitantly, all serum samples were tested for IgG using ASIA on Architect Abbott Instrument i2000SR (Abbott, IL, USA) using the manufacturer's recommended cutoff of 1.4. The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. This study was a noninterventional study with no additional sampling from the usual procedures. Biological material and clinical data were obtained only for standard viral diagnostic following physicians' prescriptions (no specific sampling, no modification of the sampling protocol). Data analyses were conducted using an anonymized database. According to the French Health Public Law (CSP Art L 1121-1.1), such protocol was exempted from informed consent application.

This rapid test performance was equivalent to that of the Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay. This immunoassay sensitivity was 90.5% in our study and 82.4% in a recent publication for samples collected \u054610 days after the onset of symptoms (4) . In that same study, the sensitivity was found to be 100% for samples collected \u054617 days after the onset of symptoms. However, using the 17-day cutoff to evaluate our data, we found a sensitivity of 94.9% (CI95%, 85.9 to 98.9). This difference could be explained by a different patient population. Indeed, IgG was not detected with ASIA for samples collected \u054610 days from the onset of symptoms or PCR positivity compared to OG in six patients, all with mild symptoms, including five from occupational health. Bryan et al. report their serum specimens came mostly from hospitalized patients and thus probably from patients with a severe or critical disease (4) . Furthermore, our population was younger, with a mean age of 52 years, while 65.6% were older than 60 in the study by Bryan et al. In our study, all patients with IgG detected only with OG were \u03fd40 years old. Younger patients may have a different immunoglobulin synthesis kinetics and/or have lower levels of Ab. The ability of this rapid test to detect IgM concomitantly to IgG is a substantial advantage, and global sensitivity was increased compared to that of ASIA to assess seroreactivity to SARS-CoV-2. OG also performs better than other rapid tests evaluated (5, 6) . OG performance characteristics were also assessed very recently in the United Kingdom and showed a sensitivity of 100% for samples collected \u054613 days after the onset of symptoms.
