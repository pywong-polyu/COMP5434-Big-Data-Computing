In the future, the energy sector will become the largest carbon emitter unless the government commits to dissolving barriers to renewable energy expansion. Literature studies indicate four barriers to LDC namely socio-cultural, economic, technology, and governance. This research aims to examine the barriers that hinder the implementation of LCD in Indonesia and to analyze which barriers are most significant. This study uses mixed methods. Qualitative and quantitative data were generated during fieldwork in DKI Jakarta, Bali, West Nusa Tenggara, and Bangka Belitung provinces. The Partial Least Square -Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) approach was used to measure the direction and strength of the relationship. The qualitative approach is useful for further deepening the provincial context that was not captured from the previous approach. This study indicates that among those four barriers, technological and governance barriers have negative significant and direct effects on LCD, and governance needs to be treated as the most critical barrier. This study emphasizes the importance of collaboration between central and local governments in implementing LCD. Shared vision, equal responsibilities, commensurate governance roles, development of fiscal instruments, can improve the coherence and continuity of renewable energy development programs and activities.",

By implementing a participatory approach, RAN-GRK requires each province in Indonesia including local governments and stakeholders to actively contribute to the Local Action Plan for GHG Emission Reduction (known as RAD-GRK). Then, in 2016, Indonesia signed the Paris Agreement and set up a new target on carbon reduction. Based on the Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC), its government committed to reducing emissions by 29% (on its own) or 41% (with international support) from the Business as Usual (BaU) scenario by 2030. Indonesia also initiated Low-Carbon Development (LCD) planning to integrate climate change mitigation policies into its national development program, as mandated by Article 3.4 of the UNFCCC.",

This covered three main programs such as renewable energy, energy efficiency, and fuels substitution from oil to biofuel. A study by predicts that reducing emissions by 43% (high-LCD scenario) in 2030 will allow the Indonesian economy to grow by 6% per year while simultaneously preventing a loss of 16 million ha in forests, improving air quality and living standards, and reducing mortality rates by up to 40,000 deaths per year between 2019 and 2045.

            "text": "Although LCD is expected to eliminate the trade-off between development and lowering emissions, Jin et al. (2020) highlight the term 'weak decoupling' and the empirical studies have not provided strong confirmation for this conclusion. This indicates that the impact of LCD on the economy cannot be generalized, each country has a different economic structure, even for the analysis within the country, the results may differ. On the other hand, Bela\u00efd et al. (2020) showed positive causation between income inequality and environmental degradation. They argued that there is a trade-off between environmental policies and policies that aims to reduce income inequality. They arguments implied that policy to reduce income inequality should not lead to an increase in carbon emissions, except in the case of low-income countries, a trade-off is absent. In the case of Indonesia, Setyadharma et al. (2020) , said that efforts to reduce poverty have an impact on decreasing environmental quality. Likewise, Kusumawardani & Dewi (2020) , said income inequality needs to be part of policy formulation to encourage economic growth, and reduce carbon emissions. Thus, it appears that in the case of Indonesia, there is a trade-off. Omri and Bela\u00efd (2021) argued that renewable energy has great potential to rebalance environmental, social, and economic goals. The Indonesian government has committed to increase the share of renewable energy in energy mixed. The share of new and renewable energy to the primary energy supply was about 22.55% in 2020 (excluding biomass), while in 2010 the share was about 10.8%. With the same data, in case of the electricity sector, total installed capacity for conventional (fossil-based) energy remains dominant, and the share has been stagnant since 2010 at about 85.5% of installed capacity. Indonesia needs to continue to push for a bigger role of renewable energy. This is because based on the climate economics index ranking, of the 48 sample countries analyzed, Indonesia's position is in the 48th, meaning that Indonesia is the country most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change (Guo et al., 2021) . This condition, of course, further encourages the need for awareness to actively participate in promoting low-carbon development. Consequently, it is important to analyze the barriers to implementing LCD in the renewable energy sector.",

They argued that by applying the systematic literature review (SLR) method, climate politics and major countries' interests have driven the conceptualization of the terms. They argued that decarbonization refers to an energy system that can be decoupling of CO 2 emissions and economic activities. This implies that CO 2 reduction will have a minimal or neutral impact on the economy. Then, they also said that LCT and LCD refer to the state or situation of development transition in pursuing net-zero CO 2 emissions. Finally, they argued that LCT puts pressure on long term process and demand for transforming or reconfigure the system, while LCD emphasized on a model of economic development that emit a minimum amount of CO 2 emissions.",

Tiba and Belaid (2020) provided a diagrammatic analysis that examines the relationship between renewable energy and the pillars of sustainable development consisting of environmental, economic, institutional, and social. They showed that the causality relationship is complex, and the main finding indicates that renewable energy is important for achieving a sustainable future. They also argued that renewable energy is a requisite condition for enhancing human well-being. However, the process of transformation and reconfiguration of development toward low emissions will have many obstacles. This paper focused on four major barriers such as socio-cultural, economic, technology and governance. Concerning governance barriers, it covers administrative, bureaucratic, actors' relations, and politics. Sovacool (2009) showed that rejection of renewable energy in the United States from 2005 to 2008 has been linked to traditional values and attitudes surrounding consumption, freedom, control, and trust. His study indicates that these cultural barriers can further be explained in three ways. First, apathy and lack of understanding in the populace may cause people to ignore the environmental costs incurred by continued reliance on fossil fuels. Second, perceptions of consumption and the abundance of energy resources may be associated with using energy-intensive devices and the attendant misconception that the energy supply will remain abundant, easily accessible, and affordable in the long term. These factors contribute to a lack of concern and awareness in society (also indicated by Adenle et al., 2017) around the urgency of developing and using renewable energy. Finally, psychological resistance can also encourage excessive energy consumption. People may be reluctant to sacrifice their comforts by switching to new energy products and may prefer to use fossil fuels that are considered to be cheaper, in terms of initial investment cost and price, than renewable energy.",

This indicates that people are fearful of losing sources of income. Locals often believe that renewable energy projects could threaten their livelihood, reflecting concern over opportunity costs. Meanwhile, the NIMBY syndrome exists when communal support is contingent on the renewable energy project not being located nearby. Furthermore, Lockwood (2013) notes that social barriers may also include producers or political elites prioritizing their short-term profits instead of sharing benefits with the local communities. For example, biofuel production can cause land conversion of rainforests or peat swamp forests and threaten the sustainability of the land originally worked by small farmers. This outcome would run contrary to the inclusive principle of LCD, which is concerned with the socio-economic interests of the poor.",

In the case of Indonesia, there are four issues recorded in the literature related to an electricity subsidy. First, electricity subsidy increases the financial fragility of electricity companies. Institute for Energy Economic and Financial Analysis (IEEFA) shows that PLN needs funding injection to strengthen the financial position without increasing electricity tariff. Second, providing more subsidies to existing customers can reduce financial resources to invest in the regions with low electrification for improving electricity access. Third, electricity subsidy under unequal electricity access does not only affect income inequality (in the context of geographic or location-based) but also at household levels. Finally, electricity subsidy may worsen the energy efficiency that had been realized due to tariff reform. Burke and Kurniawati (2018) found that since 2013, reform on electricity subsidy increased saving in annual electricity use by around 7% compared to pre-reform in 2015.",

However, it is important to note, in the last ten years, rapid advances in technology and high demand for renewable energy, have made renewable energy's position slowly but surely compete with fossil energy. IRENA (2018) showed that in 2017, investment in renewable energy has outpaced investment in fossil fuel power plants. The report also stated that the largest increase was mostly in developing and emerging countries.

This individual growth in consumption could increase energy demand significantly in a large-scale economy. Rebound effects could be reduced through the cost recovery mechanism to reduce ongoing energy demand as well as through policies of energy pricing or tradable permits. Similarly, Jia et al.

In the case of the technology barrier, we added one statement 'development of spare part industries will have a patent problem'. Then instead of defining a regulatory barrier, we defined a governance barrier. We added new six statements, such as unclear regulation caused the problem on global financial access; dominant of sectoral ego across government agencies has become a barrier for utilization of renewable energy; active of government in promoting green energy diplomacy is still lack in; Indonesia needs help from developing countries to reach emissions reduction target; the role of donor agency is still dominant in determining low carbon program; attitude of some developed countries that withdraw from Paris Agreement has affected government in fully committed to promote low carbon development program.

The other set of barriers pinpointed by academics and NGOs is defined as technological barriers. Government and legislative employees, meanwhile, consider the main issues to be economic barriers. More details on the dominant parameters of these barriers are explained in Table 1 below. In terms of socio-cultural barriers, all groups of stakeholders in this survey believe that the foremost issue is the lack of skilled and experienced workers in renewable energy projects. The lack of skilled workers may also be associated with ineffective job rotation of local government officials, causing communication constraints and knowledge gaps 3 .

This finding is in line with researchers' findings during field research. Locals in the Bangka Belitung Islands have a value known as 'dak kawa nyusah': they do not concern themselves with renewable energy and LCD projects, believing that these issues are the government's responsibility. Locals in other research sites, such as DKI Jakarta and West Nusa Tenggara, also do not exhibit major opposition to LCD programs. This may be due to the heterogeneity of metropolitan society in DKI Jakarta. Moreover, the two largest Muslim organizations in West Nusa Tenggara, known as Muhammadiyah and Nadhatul Ulama, do not take actions or hold values that would threaten the renewable energy or LCD program. As they begin to increase their share in international tourism, locals in West Nusa Tenggara have become frequently open to new changes, including the LCD paradigm.",

This can happen because job rotation is likely too frequent, making it difficult for employees to achieve a deep engagement and understanding in specific renewable energy projects 4 . Transfer of knowledge likewise cannot be properly maintained between the previous and current employees assigned in RAD-GRK. This type of issue was expressed by some stakeholders interviewed in Bali (BI, 22 April 2019; KW, 23 April 2019; IW, 26 April 2019). However, this problem is not necessarily encountered in all regions or institutions. For example, according to one interviewee (12 November 2019), there has been an official (equivalent to the head of sub-division) in the Environmental Agency (Dinas Lingkungan Hidup) of DKI Jakarta Province dealing with LCD for about ten years. In other words, there do exist employees with long-term experience and competence in the renewable energy field who could share their knowledge with other stakeholders. The informant said that considering the importance of LCD, the number of employees in this field needs to be increased as well as their competence. Because the PLS-SEM showed that socio-cultural barriers do not have a significant influence on the implementation of LCD, then it can be estimated that socio-cultural barriers also do not have a significant impact on economic barriers. Although the lack of skilled workers was indicated by descriptive statistics to be the highest-concern parameter for respondents, it is not strong enough to allow this barrier category to have a direct effect in this PLS-SEM analysis. However, the qualitative approach helps to explain that in the case of Bali province, it seems that socio-cultural has become a substantial barrier to geothermal investment. Then, research finding from DKI Jakarta Province emphasizes the importance of having competent human resources in this field. This may be related to the strong possibility of overcoming the skilled-worker problem in the short term through many approaches (El Fadel et al., 2013) .",

However, provincial governments are limited in their capacity to provide incentives. As confirmed by the Environmental Agency of DKI Jakarta Province in an in-depth interview (12 November 2019), the province has been passing regulations granting land and tax relief for buildings that meet green building requirements. On the other hand, Bali's provincial government struggles to allocate its budget and obtain the financial resources to pay the tipping fee for a waste-to-energy plant project in Suwung, Bali (FGD in Bali, 26 April 2019). The differences in regional fiscal capacity mean that provinces cannot perform equally in terms of implementing the incentive policy. Meanwhile, in the provinces of West Nusa Tenggara and Bangka Belitung, there were lack of incentives provided by the local government to encourage the use of renewable energy by the private sector. Thus, policy supports from the central government and development partners becomes important for the regions.",

Carbon trading has been achieved through several mechanisms, such as the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM), the Joint Credit Mechanism (JCM), and the Nusantara Carbon Scheme. However, the short-term gains can be achieved if government consistently reduces fossil energy subsidies and reallocates these subsidies for strengthening energy infrastructures, such as smart grids and a feed-in tariff for renewable energy. Seetharaman et al. (2019) and Dulal et al. (2013) , emphasizing that the penetration of renewable energy requires advanced technology, especially in developing countries; however, the procurement cost is often too high. The importance of technological improvement is also confirmed by empirical findings in various locations. Information collected from field research in Bali (April 2019) indicates that a solar PV of 1 MW in Kayubihi Village, Bangli Regency, sustained damage causing a 50% reduction in productivity. Components used in this power plant are mostly imported from high-tech countries. Lack of technology is also an issue in the waste-to-energy power plant in Bali, resulting in extra costs to sort organic and inorganic waste. In addition, technological upgrades are widely needed, such as in the case of the diesel power plant (PLTD) in Pilang, Belitung Regency, Province of Bangka Belitung Islands (June 2019). Although the diesel engine currently in use is capable of using B30 biodiesel, its efficiency may decrease, especially as the engines age. The technological barriers in this case may also include the limited compatibility of biodiesel and diesel power plant specifications.",

Consequently, solar PV in Kayubihi saw almost no profit from the electricity traded to PLN. The electricity sales are only sufficient to cover operational costs and sustain the power plant without profit 7 . Renewable energy investments may also be perceived as less attractive due to operational inefficiencies, including the more complex maintenance procedures required for producing renewable energies as opposed to fossil fuel energy.

Seetharaman et al. (2019) note that a lack of grid integration discourages the adoption of renewable energy. Industries that consume large quantities of electricity require specific transmission integration infrastructures, such as renewable energy from independent sources and diesel power plants from the State Electricity Company (PLN). Low grid capacity could inhibit the diffusion of wind and Photovoltaic (PV) solar power (Eleftheriadis and Anagnostopoulou, 2015) . The importance of R&D (Nguyen et al., 2010) which connects to issues of RET investment (Del R\u00edo, 2007; Masini and Menichetti, 2012; Ringel, 2003) , can also be associated with the lack of technological infrastructure. Respondents from the entrepreneurs and associations group stated that the role of R&D in energy storage technologies is still limited. In short, more R&D breakthroughs and RET investments are needed to improve smart grid infrastructure and energy storage technologies. Colenbrander et al. (2015) and Simarmata et al. (2014) demonstrate that major obstacles to climate change mitigation are highly related to deficiencies in institutional capacity and capability, government commitment or awareness, and political will. Their studies also describe the generally poor performance of local governments in designing urban planning systems, including spatial planning and collecting data required to achieve LCD targets. This may be reflected in the case of Bangka Belitung province (FGD, 21 June 2019). Most of the provincial government agencies have officially set out some programs' priorities for reducing carbon emissions. However, the proposed programs and activities tend to be partial, and tend to represent each provincial government agency's mission, as opposed to an integrated program to support RAD-GRK.",

First, the RAD-GRK concept remains too abstract; it is not clear what parameters are used to define the specifics of its implementation. Second, central and regional government administrators do not have a common perspective towards the LCD program. As a result, sectoral egos predominate. As a corollary to this attribute, the integration of programs among parties involved has proven difficult to realize on a day-to-day basis. Each ministry at the central level, and each local government agency within the regions, tend to function independently. Third, there have been unclear incentives for private parties and communities involved in the implementation of RAD-GRK. Fourth, the construction of governance in the implementation of RAN and RAD-GRK has been highly reliant on the role of the state (state-center). Meanwhile, the role of society has received less attention. Fifth, both the concept and the implementation of RAN-GRK and RAD-GRK tend to ignore the pivotal cultural features of the affected areas. In fact, the success or failure of policy implementation is, among other factors, determined by the extent to which cultural values in the affected areas are accommodated and adapted.",

This is in line with the case mentioned by Seetharaman et al. (2019) regarding ineffective government policies. Business players and investors, however, require stable and conducive conditions. Thus, the implementation of RAD-GRK in Bangka Belitung and West Nusa Tenggara provinces has several challenges. To name but a few: a) There is not yet a common awareness among stakeholders, especially regional government officials, of the RAD-GRK concept, mainly because RAD-GRK itself is still very theoretical and not yet operational; b) Government policies have been inconsistent, as leadership changes usually result in policy changes; c) No clear budget scheme has been presented; d) There are horizontal and vertical authority conflicts (Provincial vs District Governments and Provincial vs Central Governments); e) Incentive schemes for local government, the private sector, and communities in the execution of RAD-GRK are unclear; and f) Communities have low awareness of their role in supporting low carbon programs.",

The DKI Jakarta Government has formed a Climate Disaster Mitigation and Adaptation Working Team in 2020. Even long before this work team was formed, the DKI Jakarta Government was relatively fast in following up on the issuance of the RAN-GRK by making the Governor Regulation Number 131 of 2012 concerning the RAD-GRK. Recently, the DKI Jakarta Government has provided incentives for exemption from the transfer of title tax for electric vehicles, through the Decree of the Governor of DKI Jakarta Number 3 of 2020 concerning the tax incentive for the transfer of the name of motorized vehicles on battery-based electric motorized vehicles. This policy is in line with Shin (2018) , who recommends the need for performance-based compensation in promoting environmental policies. However, there are still many things that need attention from local governments, for example in accelerating the implementation of green building, providing infrastructure for electric vehicles, as well as improving municipal waste and waste management.",

Although various bureaucratic reforms to the institutions that handle energy sector affairs have been implemented in Indonesia, past political influence and limited coordination are lingering issues (Halimanjaya, 2019) . This category of problems also includes the complex licensing procedures required for several government levels and institutions in different locations, with a lack of communication and knowledge gaps among relevant stakeholders (Jupesta et al., 2011) , a state of affairs that aptly characterizes the case of biogas installations in Bali (B\u20ac o\u00dfner et al., 2019) . As the state-owned enterprise and holding authority for managing electricity transmission, PLN must follow mandates from various ministries in Indonesia, potentially leading to regulatory conflicts. Thus, integrating more efficient bureaucracy and transparency into LCD policies should be a top priority (Maulidia et al., 2019) .",

It has been argued that promoting renewable energy is important for sustainable development, but many challenges need to be considered. Previous studies have shown four main barriers, such as socio-cultural, economic, technology, and governance. This paper aims to estimate how the four barriers are connected and its connection to breaking barriers in the deployment of renewable energy. While Seetharaman et al. (2019) applying the PLS-SEM analysis, this study combined it with qualitative analysis by conducting focus group discussions and in-depth interviews with selected experts. By combining the two methods, a better understanding of the complex problems of renewable development can be explored. Indonesia has diversity in social and cultural context, and fieldwork was focused on four provinces that have been known as tourist destinations such as DKI Jakarta, Bali, West Nusa Tenggara, and Bangka Belitung. The PLS-SEM estimates were based on the questionnaire that was filled out by 92 respondents who were selected purposively from the 4 provinces.",

Third, it is important to maintain the coherence and continuity of renewable energy development programs and activities for anyone who becomes a leader at the central and regional levels. Finally, mutual benefits and trust will bind the cooperation between the central and local governments and other stakeholders to continue to collaborate in advancing the role of renewable energy.",
