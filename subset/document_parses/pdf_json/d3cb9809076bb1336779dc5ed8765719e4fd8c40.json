The duration of the use of digital devices by the children were asked to either the parents or guardians present at the time of the study. The study participants were divided into two groups: children who used digital devices for the last six months (users group) and those who hadn't used digital devices for the last six months (non users group). The users group was again divided into two subgroups: children who used digital devices for less than 3 hours per day and a day per week (low digital device users subgroup) and children who used digital devices for more than 3 hours per day and all days in a week (high digital device users subgroup).",

An investigation of over 2000 American children between 8 and 18 years of age found that, in an average day, they spent approximately 7.5 hours viewing entertainment media (comprising 4.5 hours watching television, 1.5 hours on a computer and over an hour playing computer games) [4] .

Binocular single vision requires coordinated use of both eyes, so that separate and slightly dissimilar images arising in each eye are appreciated as a single image by the process of fusion [11, 12] . For efficient single binocular vision to occur, the retinal images for the two eyes must be in good focus and of similar size and shape. This is promised by the good functioning of accommodative and vergence systems and also by the absence of any misalignment of the eyes and sensory anomalies.",

            "text": "The focusing mechanism in human eyes does not seem to work well with electronically generated characters as it works with printed characters that have well-defined edges with good background and contrast between the background and the letters [3, 13] . The characters on a computer screen are made of tiny dots called pixels. Each pixel is bright at its center and the brightness gradually decreases towards the outer edges. Therefore, electronically generated characters have blurred edges compared to letters on a printed page. Thus, the human eye finds it very difficult to maintain focus on pixel characters. This happens because when an attempt to focus on the plane of the computer is made, the eye fails to sustain the focus and relaxes to focus behind the screen [14] . This point is known as the resting point of accommodation or the dark focus. The eyes are therefore constantly relaxing to resting point of accommodation and straining to refocus on to the screen, ultimately leading to eye strain and fatigue [3, 15] . Thus, visual work on digital devices is challenging and includes frequent ocular motility, accommodation, and vergence demands [16] . The impairment of vergence and accommodative systems results in visual discomfort. This interferes significantly with visual attention, visual performance thereby limiting work capacity [17, 18] .",

It is a commonly observed syndrome in adults [20] but the concern is no less in children. Since adults have adopted and integrated digital devices in their lives, children have learned the same. This has led to children experiencing similar symptoms (such as eye ache, eye strain, double vision, lacrimation, burning eyes, blurring of vision, dryness and irritation) [21] [22] [23] related to computer use as by adults. However, when children use computers, they are more susceptible to developing problems than adults because of their unawareness towards the symptoms they are suffering, prolonged viewing without taking a break, or increased viewing angle when using digital devices set up for adults [2] . The visual discomfort caused by digital devices interferes with attention, academic performance, and limit ability to work [12, 17, 18] . It is reported that children with accommodative or vergence anomalies who use electronic devices for a significant amount of time have significantly lower GPA [21, 24] .",

This study has associated the binocular vision findings of children using digital devices and showed adverse impact on accommodative amplitude, accommodative facility and positive fusional vergences with the increased use of digital devices. In this study, there were only 10 non usersand 170 digital device users. Users group was divided into low and high digital device users subgroup. This study compared the binocular vision findings with the normative data provided by BAND study done in Tamil Nadu, India [35] . Since there were only 10 subjects in the non users group, the binocular vision findings of the non users group was not compared with the users group. The binocular vision findings were within normal limits in the non users group when compared to the normative data as shown in Table 1 . However, due to the limited data from the non-users group, the comparison is unreliable.",

This is similar to the findings of the study by Rechichi et al where the video game group had significantly lower percentage of stereo acuity when compared to the non users group of their study [1] . The accommodative amplitude was significantly better than the normative data taken from the BAND study as shown in Tables 3 and 4 ; however, the accommodative amplitude was reduced in the high digital device users subgroup than in the low digital device users subgroup as shown in Table 4 ; The presence of accommodative insufficiency was more in the high digital device users subgroup (31.71%) than in the low digital device users subgroup (16.28%) as shown in Table 5 . This finding of low digital device users subgroup is twice as greater as that of Shrestha et al.'s findings (9.7%) [29] and almost equal to the findings of Davis et al. [36] However, our study's finding was in contrast to the findings by Amit et al. [28] where there was no accommodation insufficiency in a group of children using digital devices for more than 4 [37] . Current study suggested that the monocular accommodative facility is decreased with the increased use of the digital devices in school aged children as shown in Table 4 . But even the mean monocular accommodative facility of the low digital device users subgroup for age range 13-17 was significantly lower than the normative range as shown in Table 2 . This points that the monocular accommodative facility is significantly reduced by the use of digital devices for a considerable amount of time.",
