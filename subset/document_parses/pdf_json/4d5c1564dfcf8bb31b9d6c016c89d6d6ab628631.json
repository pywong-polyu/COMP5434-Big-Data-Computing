            "text": "Due to this reliance on subjectively greater symptoms, defining AECOPD remains controversial (4). In the real world, COPD patients are often unable to express fully their daily symptom fluctuations and the range of recent changes. Additionally, it can be difficult for respiratory physicians to tell with certainty if the patient's description is really more than the \"bad days\" that virtually all COPD patients describe (5) . Hence, definition of all but the most severe AECOPD lacks clinical operability, which may delay diagnosis and proper treatment, risking more serious clinical outcomes. Many clinical therapeutic trials accordingly use a \"healthcare resource utilization\" definition as their outcome; in other words, an exacerbation is defined by an encounter with the healthcare system that led to a change in medications and site-of-care. However, although objective, this definition depends heavily on access to care, and may also miss alternative serious causes of respiratory symptoms.",

Two alternative approaches are quantification of patient reported outcomes (PRO) (6) and measurement of biomarkers (7) . To date, questionnaires in use include EXACT, CAT, BCSS, and daily diary cards. Studies on them are on-going, with the aim of a suitable tool for point-of-care use, especially in primary care settings, to help physicians to detect AECOPD early. However, questionnaire cutoffs are inconsistent between studies, and only some of the events that they identify are clinically significant. Progress in telehealth could help to detect symptom changes remotely and trigger an alert to intervene. Defining reliable predictive biomarkers would be a clinically significant achievement in early diagnosis and management of AECOPD, but we still have a long way to go there. Biomarkers in a broad sense include physical parameters such as breath rate and PEF besides blood and/or sputum indicators.",

However, the value of blood eosinophils in hospitalized AECOPD remains controversial, especially lacking large sample data from China, the country with the world's greatest burden of COPD. The study by Cui et al. aimed to evaluate the accuracy of eosinophils to predict clinical outcomes in AECOPD. The analysis uses data from the ACURE study, an ongoing nationwide multicenter, observational, pragmatic study in patients admitted for AECOPD. Based on a threshold of blood eosinophils at 2% of the total leukocyte count, 42.7% had an eosinophilic AECOPD. After propensity score matching, elevated eosinophils were only associated with better short-term outcomes in patients with a smoking history. These results suggest that eosinophil levels alone cannot be confidently used as a predictor to estimate prognosis.",

Using a bioinformatics method to analyze 16S data from AECOPD patients, Ma et al. showed that there were similar effects of ICS and SCS on the sputum microbiome in patients with AECOPD, with comparable effects on bacterial abundance and microecological diversity. Additionally, ICS has little effect on the lung microbiome of AECOPD, potentially a treatment advantage by reducing the risk of selecting for antibiotic resistant organisms.",
