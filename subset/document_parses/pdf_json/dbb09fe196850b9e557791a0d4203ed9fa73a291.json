We synthesize the findings into a final report that includes key messages, with a rating of the certainty of the evidence using GRADE, as well as an overview of evidence and remaining knowledge gaps. Rapid reviews are typically completed and disseminated within two weeks. From May 2020 to July 21, 2021, we have answered more than 31 distinct questions and completed 32 updates as new evidence emerged. Reviews receive an average of 213 downloads per week, with some reaching over 7700.

An up-to-date guideline based on high-quality systematic reviews is considered the best source of evidence for decision-making [7] . The time to conduct a full systematic review and guideline (> 1-2 years [8] ) vastly exceeds the time available to make urgent decisions during public health crises [8] . As a result, several global evidence synthesis organizations [9] [10] [11] pivoted to producing COVID-19-related rapid reviews (RR). RRs can be defined as \"a form of knowledge synthesis that accelerates the process of conducting a traditional systematic review through streamlining or omitting a variety of methods to produce evidence in a resource-efficient manner\" [12] . A number of different methodological approaches to conducting a RR exist in order to 'streamline' the approach, including limiting the number of databases or timeframe searched, using only a single reviewer for screening, data extraction and/ or critical appraisal, or omitting steps such as critical appraisal, meta-analysis, and fulsome write-up [13] . As RRs may have a greater likelihood of bias due to expedited processes, transparency in method is important, with explicit identification of departures from systematic review methods [14] [15] [16] . A systematic and rigorous process should be maintained with respect to searching, study selection, data extraction, and quality assessment [17] . The production of high-quality syntheses, including critical appraisal of included studies, is particularly important in the current COVID-19 \"infodemic\" [18, 19] .",

As awareness of the service grew, requests came from decision-makers at all levels across Canada and indirectly through involvement in the COVID-19 Evidence Network to support Decision-Makers (COVID-END) [26] . As requests increased, the RES coordination role was formalized to exclusively plan workflow, assign staff tasks, and monitor completion. Requests were formally received through a direct email to the NCCMT's central email account; through a key contact at our funder, the PHAC, who coordinates evidence synthesis requests from a number of decisionmakers and committees within the agency; and through the COVID-END evidence network. Requests were also received informally from NCCMT colleagues, and sometimes suggested internally by NCCMT staff.",

Decisions as to which questions to accept were made through team discussion at the weekly team meeting and were based on several factors including: the urgency and relevance to Canada; in-house content expertise and capacity; and availability of evidence, determined by a preliminary scan of databases. Once accepted, an RR Lead is assigned. The Search Lead first looks to see if a recently completed review on the topic exists by scanning COVID-19 RR repositories and websites of organizations known to conduct rigorous syntheses. This step was introduced after we identified duplication of efforts between our team and others (Additional File 1). At first, we considered a synthesis with a search completed within the last week to be 'up-to-date' . If another synthesis meeting this criterion was identified, we would not proceed with the question and informed the requestor of the other review. As the volume of evidence has grown, and the urgency of decision-making has slowed, as of May 2021 a search completed in the two months is considered 'up-to-date' .",

The RR Lead, RES Coordinator, and RR Search Lead/Staff collaboratively develop a strategy for each question including databases to search, search terms and parameters for each database, and whether grey literature will be included. Our initial search strategy included 14 databases or websites, ten of which were developed specifically for COVID-19 ( Table 2 ). The search may involve an advanced keyword string (e.g., The World Health Organization's COVID-19 Global Literature on Coronavirus Disease) or a manual site scan (e.g., Public Health England's completed reviews). Over time, the list of databases evolved as some collections were duplicative of others or were no longer updated frequently (e.g., Cochrane COVID Review bank), others were developed (e.g., L\u00b7OVE) and decisions to change to different databases were made to take search sophistication into account (e.g., switching from LitCovid to Medline) (Additional File 1). For searches where a very large number of results are identified that may not be feasible to screen, a very small number of results are identified, or the results appear largely irrelevant, a sample of search results is sent to the RR Lead to revise the search strategy; a health sciences librarian may also be contacted for guidance.",

Depending on the question, we may consider a search for data from various public health jurisdictions (e.g., policy documents, regional surveillance data), to supplement scientific evidence or when this may enhance our ability to answer a question. For example, in a review on COVID-19's role on substance use, overdoses, and substance-related deaths, we supplemented the search of scientific literature with available surveillance data across Canada [27] . Initially, most COVID-19-specific databases and repositories did not have functions to export all references into reference management software. To accommodate this, RR Search Staff entered potentially eligible studies, based on title and abstract screening, into an Excel spreadsheet for full text screening by the RR Lead. As the functionality for many databases evolved, we began to export references into Rayyan -an open access systematic review screening software [28] -for screening. Rayyan enhances efficiency by facilitating removal of duplicates and allowing simultaneous screening by multiple team members. We now use DistillerSR software (which requires a paid subscription) to facilitate deduplication of references, which is particularly helpful for review updates.",

In response, we adapted the GRADE approach [25, 34] : an assessment of the certainty in findings based on eight domains. In the GRADE approach, observational studies, for example, provide low quality evidence. This assessment can be further reduced based on: risk of bias; inconsistency in effects; indirectness of interventions/outcomes; imprecision in effect estimate; and publication bias [25] . The assessment can be upgraded based on a large effect, evidence of a doseresponse relationship, and properly accounting for confounding. The overall certainty of the evidence (strong, moderate, low, very low) for each outcome is determined [25] .

A more fulsome evaluation of the impact of the NCCMT's RES on decision-making in Canada is planned, which will include a survey of senior decision-makers, key informant interviews, and a comprehensive analysis of web analytics and citation tracking. .",

            "text": "A primary challenge to any RR is balance between speed and rigor. This issue is even more pronounced in the context of COVID-19 given the massive amount of data and the urgency with which evidence is needed to inform decisions. The streamlined approach of RRs (e.g., single reviewer screening) will always introduce some degree of bias, so it is important to establish and follow a transparent process. The evolving evidence landscape has necessitated many changes to our typical RR methodology; we anticipate further changes may be needed. For example, We are aware of other Canadian and international organizations conducting RRs on a number of topics related to COVID-19; many report adaptations to the RR process that are similar to ours [17, 23, [43] [44] [45] [46] . For example, many include preprints and grey literature, when previously, only published sources were included [23] . Cochrane emphasizes involving stakeholders throughout the process to better tailor the RR for decision-making [17] and established a question identification and prioritization approach [45] . The Usher Network for COV(id) Evidence Reviews (UNCOVER) recommends against restricting to English-language, as a large volume of COVID-19 research has emerged from non-Englishspeaking countries [46] . All groups reiterate the importance of speed and critical appraisal, some adopting new software to achieve this [17, 23, 45, 46] .",

However, we faced a number of challenges from both a human and financial resources perspective. While some reviews fell neatly within our planned time frames, some required greater resource allocation due to the number of eligible studies (e.g. a RR on transmission risk in acute care settings [49] ). Although our team has expertise in searching, critical appraisal, and synthesis, we do not have content area expertise in all fields related to infectious diseases. For questions focused on basic science, laboratory, or mathematical modelling studies, we connected with modelling and infectious disease experts at McMaster Univesity and the National Collaborating Centres for Indigenous Health, Infectious Disease, and Environmental Health. Over time, we have shifted our response to these questions by either partnering with other oganizations with specific content expertise to support completion or recommending other organizations that could complete the review.",

In our topic selection process, we regularly scan relevant websites and repositories to decrease the chance of duplication, but due to the time lag in agreeing to take on a question and having the final product available online, we are aware of instances where duplication of efforts has occurred. RRs may be considered outdated soon after completion due to the speed at which evidence is available. While we have integrated RR updates into our workflow, it is not possible to update all topics. An ongoing challenge is how to handle reviews that may no longer be based on the most recent and highest quality evidence. There is a need to combine forces and identify mechanisms for effective communication and sharing of resources to ensure that timely and rigorous reviews can be completed and shared amongst organizations to contribute to the global pandemic response. We are actively working on developing strategies to collaborate with provincial, national, and international organizations conducting public health relevant reviews to avoid duplication. Participation in COVID-END [26] , funded by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) [53], is one strategy that helps to reduce duplication, as well as the NCCMT's RR repository of ongoing and recently completed RRs related to COVID-19 [54] .",
