Most of the droplets and dried nuclei deposit on various objects (e.g., door knobs, tabletops, buttons, handrails, and touchscreens), turning them into potentially infectious \"fomites\", but some may even become airborne for a period of time. Direct infection could thus occur through inhalation by other people within close proximity (e.g., 1\u22122 m), especially for a crowd in a relatively closed space. Infection could also occur when virions released by an infected person are spread on their hands and clothing and then transferred to others through close contact, such as handshaking. Fomites infection 6 is indirect and rather stealthy; it occurs only if a person first picks up the virions from contaminated objects and surfaces (e.g., by their hands) and then transfers them to his or her mouth, nose, or eyes. Throughout these processes, the virions need to endure a complex and dynamic set of environmental conditions outside the human body. Therefore, there are many opportunities to set up barriers using physical sciences and engineering (dashed lines in Figure 1 ) to block and to deactivate the overwhelming majority of released virions before they reach hosts and breach the final biological and immunological defenses. Some examples include (a) isolating infectious patients and/or reducing the spread of their respiratory fluid droplets, (b) cleaning and sanitizing objects and surfaces, (c) filtering potentially contaminated air, (d) washing hands frequently, (e) establishing better personal hygiene habits, and (f) wearing personal protection equipment (PPE). Understanding the basic structure of virions and their surroundings is required for designing inactivation and removal strategies and maximizing the effectiveness of these barriers (Figure 1a\u2212f). All of these defense barriers contribute to blocking the source of virions, breaking the spread pathways, and protecting the susceptible hosts. Compared to other known infectious diseases caused by coronaviruses, COVID-19 can spread through an additional stealth mode of asymptomatic transmission, 7\u22129 which dramatically increases the difficulty of detecting, monitoring, and preventing its spread.",

            "text": "Generally speaking, viruses are essentially metastable, core\u2212 shell nanoparticles that are biologically produced in cells with a quite remarkable self-assembly process. 10 The core is made of a coiled genomic polymer and tightly packaged in a protective protein shell called a capsid, which is tiled up by presynthesized subunits. For coronaviruses (Figure 2 ), such as those that cause SARS, MERS, and COVID-19, the RNA is directly complexed with and protected by a helical protein shell to form a coiled nucleocapsid. It is then enveloped by a lipid bilayer membrane decorated with various other proteins, such as the protruding \"corona\" spikes, which interact with the host cell. The biological function of viruses to preserve and, eventually, to deliver their nucleic acids to host cells depends on the virus' structural integrity. For example, for enveloped viruses, their lipid bilayer must stay intact throughout the pathways to keep them infectious. The protein capsid must be sufficiently strong to confine the elastically strained genomic coil and sufficiently tough to sustain osmotic pressure fluctuation in changing surroundings, yet they must be able to disassemble readily inside the host cells to release the genomic core. These constraints demand rather intricate protein building blocks that also must maintain desirable configurations to avoid malfunction. The envelope and capsid, however, can be compromised by an array of physical treatments, such as UV irradiation, heating, and desiccation, as well as by chemical sanitization using acids, oxidants, alcohols, or some specialized surfactants. 10\u221212 Approaches like these may seem relatively primitive; however, they can be extremely effective in slowing down or even preventing virus spread and transmission. There are many opportunities to set up barriers using physical sciences and engineering to block and to deactivate the overwhelming majority of released virions before they reach hosts and breach the final biological and immunological defenses.",

The first barrier to infection should be put up at the starting point ( Figure 1 , dashed line a) to reduce the number and viability of virions released by an infected person. To this end, infected patients are required to wear medical masks, which can block and absorb large coughed droplets and reroute the smaller ones to reduce their forward traveling distance. 13, 14 Masks are an important component in PPE ( Figure 1 , dashed line f) for frontline healthcare workers. In the current COVID-19 pandemic, there has been much discussion about whether masks are capable of blocking virus nanoparticles, which are typically around 100 nm in diameter. 15 However, this implies that virions released by an infected person stay airborne as individual uncoated nanoparticles, which is rather misleading. As shown in Figure 3 , respiratory fluid droplets contain a variety of other components, typically of a few weight percent, 16, 17 including insoluble particulates such as proteins, enzymes, commensal microflora (i.e., bacteria) colonized in the upper respiratory tract, and cell debris from the respiratory tract lining; amphiphilic liposomal matter such as lung surfactants and cholesterol; and soluble molecular species such as salt and lactate. Therefore, in the flying droplets or the final dried nuclei, virions are always surrounded by these materials and are usually a minority component, the loading of which varies by the conditions of the patients.",

However, to the best of our knowledge, the effect of surface porosity is not well-understood. One hypothesis is that nuclei particles are more likely to pick up moisture from the air through capillary condensation on smooth surfaces than on porous ones. 20, 21 The water-soluble, hygroscopic components in the nuclei can hold condensed water to protect embedded virions from desiccation. On porous surfaces, condensed water can be drained away from the nuclei to equilibrate with the rest of the surface, leading to faster water loss around the virions. Desiccation is effective for deactivating enveloped virions because the assembly of the membrane bilayer relies on water. 22, 23 Moreover, capillary compression 24 can also mechanically squeeze the mixture in the drying droplets and potentially deform and damage the virion particles inside.",

            "text": "Chemical Modulation of Respiratory Fluid Droplets. In addition to blocking the droplets, it would also be effective to deactivate virions at the origin of the chain events leading up to infection. Here, one might employ ways to \"pollute\" virionladen droplets with antiviral or sanitizing molecules 25 when they pass through a mask. For example, a useful strategy may involve on-mask chemical modulation in which such molecules are loaded on the mask to presanitize the exhaled droplets. These molecules should be released in the warm and moisturized air during exhalation but stay fixed on the mask during the inhalation of colder and drier air. It would be most useful to use the chemical modifier as a drop-in accessory, such as in the form of a sticky and permeable film that can adhere to the outer surface of a mask as needed. This may facilitate widespread use and does not need to disrupt the manufacturing and supply chain management of masks, which is already highly stressed by the explosive surge in demand. 26 It is also well-known that metabolism and food can dramatically affect the composition of exhaled air (e.g., bad breath). Therefore, with the help of medical researchers and doctors, perhaps one could think of some in situ methods for altering the chemical composition of respiratory fluids by taking \"saliva modifiers\" (e.g., ingredients that help to inactivate virions) in the form of pills, lozenges, cough drops, or even chewing gums. One may even customize a diet or use food supplements such that antiviral molecules can be self-generated in the respiratory fluids by metabolism. Both on-mask and in situ chemical modulation approaches would benefit from the third power scaling law of droplet volume and diameter, which can greatly concentrate the antiviral molecules during droplet evaporation. Both strategies can be enhanced by deeper and more relevant scientific understandings in the molecular mechanisms of virion inactivation.",

Fomite transmission is hard to trace but common for many respiratory diseases. 6 This transmission is often mitigatable with physical and chemical sanitization, such as through spraying or wiping. However, sanitization is labor-and materials-intensive, impractical for covering all exposed areas, and needs to be reapplied periodically. Water-or alcohol-based sanitizers may not be able to act fully and uniformly across entire surfaces during practical operation due to issues related to dewetting and volatility. Therefore, it will be useful to engineer self-sanitizing surfaces that can slowly release disinfecting chemicals to mitigate fomite transmission. Such coatings should be durable against rubbing and washing, long-lasting, and nontoxic and should be grown easily on the surfaces of already-installed objects that people frequently touch. This direction can leverage knowledge gained through numerous material studies about control-release processes and may even define new research needs.",

For example, goggle fogging turns out to be quite problematic because one cannot risk contamination to clear them by usual means. Therefore, antifogging functionality must be added. 31 For facial masks such as N95 aspirators, they usually need to be tightly fit to one's face (e.g., with strong rubber bands) and can cause a great deal of discomfort or allergic reactions. 32 In practice, the one-size-fits-all aspirators sometimes do not match the diverse facial profiles of different users, leading to potential safety issues due to leakage or skin damage.

This discomfort adds to healthcare workers' already high physical and psychological stress.
