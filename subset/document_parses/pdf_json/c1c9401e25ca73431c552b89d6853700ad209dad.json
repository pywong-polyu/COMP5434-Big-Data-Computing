However, a growing literature suggests that ROHs are ubiquitous in outbred populations. Still, most existing genetic studies of ROH in populations are limited to aggregated ROH content across the genome, which does not offer the resolution for mapping causal loci. This limitation is mainly due to a lack of methods for efficient identification of shared ROH diplotypes. Here, we present a new method, ROH-DICE, to find large ROH diplotype clusters, sufficiently long ROHs shared by a sufficient number of individuals, in large cohorts. ROH-DICE identified over 1 million ROH diplotypes that span over 100 SNPs and shared by more than 100 UK Biobank participants. Moreover, we found significant associations of clustered ROH diplotypes across the genome with various self-reported diseases, with the strongest associations found between the extended HLA region and autoimmune disorders. We found an association between a diplotype covering the HFE gene and haemochromatosis, even though the well-known causal SNP was not directly genotyped nor imputed. Using genome-wide scan, we identified a putative association between carriers of an ROH diplotype in chromosome 4 and an increase of mortality among .

One, through this conversion, the true ROH diplotype clusters, mostly consisting of homozygous sites, are relatively intact and will still have a high probability of maintaining a good portion of their haplotype. However, some post hoc processing may be needed to merge the ROH diplotype clustered with minor deviations of their consensus sequences. Notably, this conversion should introduce very few false positives as when the length cutoff and the width cutoff is large, there is little chance a non-ROH diplotype cluster will emerge. Two, this effectively converts the panel into a haplotype panel (with two possible values 0 and 2 at each position), where efficient algorithms for identifying haplotype matching blocks are available.

Each individual with more than 1% heterozygous sites within the block was removed from the cluster. Any two clusters with the same consensus and the exact starting and ending positions were merged. A total of 1,880,826 ROH clusters (shared among at least 100 individuals and extending at least 100 consecutive sites) were identified in all 22 autosomal chromosomes. The average length of these ROHs is 553,095 bp (~0.55 cM). The distribution of ROH clusters is very uneven (Figure 3) . Interestingly, the number of ROH clusters in chromosome 6 is the highest. This is mainly due to the excessive number of ROH clusters in the MHC region (65,458). Figure 4 illustrates the genome-wide coverage of the ROH clusters, with visible peaks at chromosomes 2, 6, and 8. A peak region in chromosome 2 (chr2:135755899-136827560) has been reported to harbor a high selection signal 23 . This region contains the LCT gene which includes a variant selected for lactose tolerance in European population 24 .

Surprisingly, some clusters comprise more than a hundred thousand individuals sharing the same ROH consensus. The high rate of ROH clusters in the MHC region may be due to high marker density and low recombination rates 25, 26 . The ROHs are abundant in regions with low recombination rates and also their distribution is expected to be population-specific and the hotspots and coldspots may vary in different populations 27 . The ROH coldspot in European population is reported to be located in chromosome 18 27 which is consistent with our ROH diplotypes results using British individuals in the UK Biobank data.

We found over 1.8 million ROH diplotype clusters spanning over 100 SNPs and shared by over 100 individuals. While we reported this single data point, the interpretation of the genome-wide ROH diplotype distribution is difficult. First, the expected distribution of ROH diplotype clusters is not known. In general, such ROH regions may be under strong recessive selection, and thus the ROH cluster frequency might be higher under a null model (no selection). Further, the distribution of ROH diplotype clusters may depend on the demographic history.

However, at the time we started this project, all existing PBWT algorithms 21, [40] [41] [42] were aimed at identifying pairwise matches. In this work, we propose to employ the PBWT data structures to search for clusters of multi-way matches instead of individual pairs of matches. Independent of our work, a couple of algorithms have been proposed to find haplotype blocks in a PBWT panel 43, 44 . The algorithm by Cunha et al. 43 may not be feasible to handle biobank scale data.

Moreover, a minimum length threshold in terms of both sites and number of individuals would be more meaningful for downstream analysis especially association analysis, e.g. where a minimum number of cases is required. Hence, after detecting all possible clusters, filtering has to be applied to remove spurious clusters. Here, we formulate the haplotype blocks problem with two distinct objective functions which will reduce the complexity of filtering the detected clusters afterwards.",

We refer to these clusters as blocks, where the number of sequences W is the width of the block in terms of the number of haplotypes, and the length of matches L is the length of the block in terms of the number of sites. Recall the concept of set maximal match of Durbin 21 as the pairwise haplotype match that cannot be extended at either end. We extend the concept of set maximal match to block maximal match, i.e., the haplotype match block that cannot be extended. As the block is a 2D object, the extension can be defined either lengthwise or widthwise. Therefore, we can define the lengthwise block maximal match as the matching block that cannot be extended lengthwise. Similarly, the widthwise block maximal match as that which cannot be extended widthwise.",

We can either report the block boundary that maximizes the length -length-maximal PBWT block, or the block boundary that maximizes the widthwidth-maximal PBWT block. We developed exact algorithms for identifying and reporting block maximal matches. This is achieved by using proper data structures tracking the starting position of the matches and the upper and lower boundaries of each matching block.
