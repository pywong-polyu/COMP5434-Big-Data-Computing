In particular, we have identified a novel HKU5-related Merbecovirus in a cotton dataset sequenced by the Huazhong Agricultural University in 2017. We have also found an infectious clone sequence containing a novel HKU4-related Merbecovirus related to MERS coronavirus in a rice dataset sequenced by the Huazhong Agricultural University in early 2020. Another HKU5-related Merbecovirus, as well as Japanese encephalitis virus, were identified in a cotton dataset sequenced by the Huazhong Agricultural University in 2018. An HKU3-related Betacoronavirus was found in a Mus musculus sequencing dataset from the Wuhan Institute of Virology in 2017. Finally, a SARS-WIV1-like Betacoronavirus was found in a rice dataset sequenced by the Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University in 2017. Using the contaminating reads we have extracted from the above datasets, we were able to assemble complete genomes of two novel coronaviruses which we disclose herein. In light of our findings, we raise concerns about biosafety protocol breaches, as indicated by our discovery of multiple dangerous human pathogens in agricultural sequencing laboratories in Wuhan and Fouzou City, China.",

Furthermore, we have undertaken de novo assembly of a dataset from an Oryza sativa Japonica sequencing BioProject (PRJNA602160) and isolated a putative human infectious clone sequence containing a novel HKU4-r CoV.

The presence of contaminating reads of potentially human pathogenic MERS-r CoVs within agricultural research datasets, which do not have the same high biosafety standards or protocols as BSL3 laboratories (Klein, 2012; Heckert and Kozlovac, 2014) , presents evidence of potential significant public health hazards associated with biosafety laboratories in Wuhan, China. Furthermore, the discovery of the unexpected Merbecovirus sequences, which were actively researched by WIV (Yang et al. 205, Luo et al. 2018) , in HZAU datasets indicates potential cross-contamination between WIV and HZAU, both between samples and within multiplexed runs.",

The sequence was found to be only 91% similar to other known full-length coronavirus sequences available at NCBI. Phylogenetic analysis was conducted which placed the novel Merbecovirus sequence in the HKU5 clade (Fig. 4 , and Supp. Data: Supplementary_Information_4_HKU5-1-Cotton-HZAU-SRR5885860_Blast_Tree_Vi ew.pdf). BLAST analysis was then run on the gene coding region for RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) (nt positions 15522-15908) against the available partial RdRp sequences at GenBank (Supp. Fig 3) . An RdRp-based phylogenetic tree of the newly discovered Merbecovirus against available partial RdRp sequences on GenBank was then generated (Fig. 5) . To characterize the spike glycoprotein, BLAST analysis of the spike gene (nt positions 21710-25789) of the novel HKU5-related Merbecovirus against the BLAST nt database was conducted (Supp. Fig. 4) . The coding sequence has the highest identity to that of Pipistrellus bat coronavirus HKU5, but was still significantly different from known sequences available at GenBank (Fig. 6) . The spike of this novel Merbecovirus shares only a 88.67% identity with the closest published spike in GenBank. As the 10 closest viruses by the RdRp region did not have published spike sequences, we cannot determine the spike similarity between this novel Merbecovirus and these viral strains. Closely related viruses for which both RdRp and spike sequences were published were found to have only a weak correlation between RdRp and spike identity (Fig. 7) . We also cannot rule out a potential recombination event between these viral strains and the novel Merbecovirus identified in our study. ",

We hypothesize a possible explanation for this conundrum which should be further investigated: the final sequence loaded to GenBank MN611520.1 may have been assembled as DNA, and sequenced on the same lane as SRR7896912. The HKU5-related CoV contamination then occurred due to index hopping during sequencing. An actual bat sample was sequenced on a second lane.

The biological agent of study (Gossypium hirsutum) is a low risk agent with no potential to cause disease or economic loss. Further, the samples were prepared and sequenced in an agricultural laboratory without the requirement for the facility, safety equipment and protocols of a BSL-3 pathogen biosafety laboratory for which isolates of the high-risk human pathogen JEV are required to be handled. We note the publication of an experiment using JEV within the HZAU using pig (Sus Scrofa) cells (Zheng, 2019) . As the Mitochondrial sequences of Sus Scrofa have been found in SRR7896916 (Supp . Table 3 ), we infer the likely origin of the JEV reads from SRR7896916 to be a pig cell infection experiment. As all infection experiments using wild-type (field isolate) of JEV require BSL-3 conditions, the escape of this JEV sample and its subsequent introduction into SRR7896916 constitutes a BSL-3 breach with the release of BSL-3 microorganisms within the HZAU facility. As the JEV strain MN639770.1 is a field (wild-type) strain originally isolated from human sera in Yunnan, with all its closest sequences in NCBI GenBank having origins in either Yunnan or Guangdong (but not Wuhan), the sample found within Wuhan is likely a known sequence previously isolated in culture. This hypothesis is strengthened by the observation that de novo assembled contigs were found to be of the same level of similarity (same E value in BLAST result) to both MN639770.1 and to MH258848.1 (strain SA14), both of which are non-attenuated non-vaccine strains requiring BSL-3 conditions for analysis.",

As MERS-CoV is considered a BSL-3 organism, and MERS-r CoVs are considered BSL-2 organisms, the presence of a MERS-r CoV sequence appears to represent an escape of the MERS-r CoV material from a laboratory with a biosafety level of BSL-2 at a minimum, and its subsequent introduction into a different laboratory.

The BioProject for the Oriza Sativa Japonica sequencing was registered at GenBank on January 19, 2020, but to this date the HKU4-r CoV has not been published by the WIV. We note that Oryza sativa cultivar:japonica (rice) sequencing BioProject PRJNA601977 was registered on NCBI on the 17/01/2020 by the WIV, 2 days before registration of the Oryza sativa Japonica BioProject PRJNA602160 by the HZAU (containing the novel HKU4-r CoV clone), indicating the two projects may be related, however this observation cannot be confirmed as no data has been published for PRJNA601977 by the WIV.",

There are no known publications documenting a reverse genetic system on the strain BtTp-BetaCoV/GX2012, from which the backbone of the novel HKU4-r CoV purported human infectious clone identified here was derived. Compared with BtTp-betaCoV-GX2012 we note minimal insertions: notably the insertion of the sequence TTT between A5555-A5558 and the sequence TGTTCC between A8183-T8190 in ORF1a. This is quite unexpected for directed engineering, indicating that an unpublished backbone was used.

Consequently, the mapping pattern for both type II and type IIS restriction endonuclease recognition sites across these sequences was not conserved. Querying of the sites that correspond to type II or type IIS restriction sites in these sequences did not reveal any universally conserved nucleotides across known sequences of HKU4 and MERS-CoV within NCBI databases, which is evident by the lack of conservation of these sites across these sequences. In an attempt to obtain a potential previous reverse genetics system for HKU4-like coronaviruses, we also performed a keyword search using \"HKU4\" and \"reverse genetics\" or \"infectious clone\" using PubMed and Google Scholar. However, we found no scientific publications which disclose such a reverse genetic system, or have demonstrated the construction of an infectious clone for HKU4-related coronaviruses. We therefore conclude that no obvious signature of synthetic engineering with known reverse genetic systems could be deduced from any of the three sequences analyzed alone. Indeed, all 3 sequences have similar levels of cloning difficulty, and could all be cloned without inducing nucleotide changes as per when a newly disclosed reverse genetic system was developed recently to clone SARS-CoV-2 (Xie et al. 2021) , or the very first type IIS restriction endonuclease based gene assembly system was used to clone the first known coronavirus (Yount et al. 2002) .",
