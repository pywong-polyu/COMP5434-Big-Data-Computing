            "text": "This paper proposes a strategy to measure economic insecurity in countries in the Global South. It builds a 'Multidimensional Economic Insecurity Index' (MEII) that combines four indicators of economic vulnerability that cause stress and anxiety: unexpected economic shocks, unprotected employment or non-workers in the household, over-indebtedness and asset poverty. The index offers a measure that directly relates economic uncertainty to stress and anxiety due to the lack of protection and buffers to face an unexpected economic shock. The MEII is applied to Chile using Survey of Household Finances (SHF) cross-sectional data (2007, 2011, 2014 and 2017). The results show that (i) about half of the Chilean households experienced, on average, two or more economic vulnerabilities during the last decade with an intensity of 2.3 vulnerabilities, and (ii) economic insecurity affects households on the entire income distribution, even in the highest income deciles groups. By identifying the groups of households most affected by economic insecurity and its trend in recent years, applying the MEII in countries such as Chile provides relevant information to monitor, evaluate and improve social safety nets besides labour market regulations.",

Since then, several authors have proposed measures of economic insecurity that address the stress and anxiety produced by exposure to adverse economic events and the incapacity to face them when they occur. 1 This paper proposes a multidimensional measure of economic insecurity at the household level that is applicable to contexts where: (i) inequalities in household wealth are high, (ii) the social safety net is limited, (iii) indebted households are increasing due to strong credit growth, and (iv) the reduction of absolute income poverty rather than relative poverty is the primary policy concern.",

This social group faces high economic insecurity since they have neither sufficient assets to offset an economic shock nor access to unemployment insurance or compensation in case of dismissal when working in the informal sector.",

To do so, I build four objective indicators (unexpected economic shocks, unprotected employment or non-workers, over-indebtedness, and asset poverty) for two dimensions of economic insecurity: (i) household risk to an unexpected economic event, and (ii) lack of household buffers to face an economic shock. I combine these indicators using a multidimensional approach to build an adjusted multidimensional vulnerability rate called the 'Multidimensional Economic Insecurity Index' (MEII). This approach has two stages. First, I identify the economic vulnerabilities, and then, I apply an aggregation procedure to integrate the multidimensional information on economic insecurity into a single scalar measure (Alkire & Foster, 2011) . The Chilean Survey of Household Finances (SHF) cross-sectional data (2007, 2011, 2014 and 2017) are used to build the MEII.",

The first advantage is that it simultaneously measures the incidence (proportion of economically insecure households) and the intensity of the economic insecurity (number of vulnerabilities affecting it). The second advantage is that the MEII can be decomposed by population subgroups (e.g., income decile groups or geographic areas) and economic insecurity domains (e.g., employment, income, indebtedness, and wealth). Thus, it allows for monitoring each of the dimensions of insecurity that are targeted by multi-sectoral policy strategies such as unemployment insurance, investment in social and affordable housing, micro-finance interventions, cash transfers, and policies to stimulate saving, among others. It is the first time to apply the concept of economic insecurity to middle-income countries and complement other well-being measures, such as vulnerability to poverty and multidimensional poverty, which are more commonly used in these countries.",

            "text": "The estimates for Chile between 2007/2017 show high levels of economic insecurity in regard to both the risk of an unexpected economic event and the lack of a household buffer to offset a potential loss. More than a third of households were exposed to unexpected economic shocks during this period. The indicators providing information about households' lack of protection reveal that 62.8 per cent were asset poor, 30 per cent had only unprotected workers or non-workers, and 15.4 per cent faced over-indebtedness. Combining the measures in the MEII, we found that, on average, about half of Chilean households experienced two or more economic vulnerabilities during the last decade, with an intensity of 2.3 vulnerabilities. The index is correlated with more conventional macro indicators such as the GDP growth rate and labour informality rate. The highest index levels are between 2007 and 2011, followed by a significant decrease between 2011 and 2014, increasing again between 2014 and 2017. This paper makes three contributions. First, from a conceptual point of view, it uses two dimensions of economic insecurity related to an unexpected economic event and the household buffer to protect from this potential economic loss. Although both dimensions (and their respective indicators) are sources of insecurity, each of which may trigger stress and anxiety in individuals and households, the origin of these adverse psychological effects differs. In previous work, the focus in terms of the selection of indicators has either been on choosing between subjective and objective indicators (Rohde et al., 2015; or on just one source of economic insecurity (Azzopardi, Fareed, Lenain, & Sutherland, 2019; Balestra & Tonkin, 2018; Bossert & D'Ambrosio, 2013; Hacker et al., 2014; Rohde et al., 2014) .",

These approaches go beyond gross domestic product (GDP) to measure welfare, acknowledging that production is not an appropriate indicator of individual and social well-being. One of the new well-being metrics that has been studied theoretically and empirically at both levels is economic insecurity (Hacker, 2018; Osberg, 2018; Rohde & Tang, 2018) . The notion of economic insecurity refers to \"the adverse wellbeing effect of (involuntary) exposure to uncertainty in enduring an uninsured financial shortfall\" (Rohde & Tang, 2018, p. 303) . The idea behind it is that economic insecurity has a subjective component and is a forward-looking measure since stress and anxiety are associated with financial uncertainty. This measure assumes that changes in the subjective levels of anxiety in regard to lacking economic safety are highly correlated with changes in the objective risk (Osberg, 1998; Osberg & Sharpe, 2014) .",

Beyond this formal recognition, the value of measuring economic insecurity is that provides estimates on two key welfare costs associated with it. First, economic insecurity makes difficult for households with children to plan for the future, resulting in psychological distress in the household environment and in diminished well-being, human capital investment, and development of the children in the household (Hardy, 2014; Hill et al., 2013; Western et al., 2016) .",

Second, economic insecurity is a phenomenon that deals with unobservable and forwardlooking expectations rather than retrospective information.

The IES comes from the 'named risks' approach, which examines four downside economic risks named in Article 25 of the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights (i.e., unemployment, family breakup, medical costs, and poverty in old age). Osberg and Sharpe (2014) applied an IES adjusted to 70 countries and found substantially different levels of economic insecurity across rich and developing countries. The ILO index uses aggregated data from countries to measure seven forms of labour security (income, labour market, employment, work, skills, job, and voice representation). This index is currently applied to 90 countries, covering 86 per cent of their population (Rohde & Tang, 2018) .",

Most of these measures of economic insecurity have focused on the United States, showing a significant increase in recent decades, with peaks in the years 1998 and 2007. Nevertheless, integrated measures fail to include important dimensions of economic insecurity in their construction, focusing on large income loss or the buffering role of private wealth or income volatility (Osberg, 2018) . For example, they fail to capture the social protection that the state can provide (e.g. eligibility for unemployment insurance benefits or severance payments) or do not incorporate subjective measures on the perception of the economic situation that reflect the anxiety and concern of individuals in a direct way (Espinosa et al., 2014) .",

The rationale behind this multidimensional measure is that an appropriate concept of economic insecurity should be able to capture all types of economic stress explained by the risk of a negative financial future. Rohde et al. (2015) analysed the case of Australia using indicators of job insecurity, financial dissatisfaction, emergency funds, unemployment risk, expenditure distress and income drop, and found that these are correlated with the country's unemployment rate and GDP growth rate. Following a similar methodology, Romaguera de la Cruz (2020) apply a multidimensional measure of economic insecurity in three developed countries, being significantly present in middle-income households both in Spain and France but not in Sweden. 3 It is worth mentioning that economic insecurity measures at individual-level have not been developed in the Global South. 4 Although Osberg & Sharpe's IES proposed a multidimensional measure at the aggregate level to compare both Global North and Global South countries, indices of economic insecurity at the individual or household level allow for comparative analysis between different groups within each country, making them a key tool for the design of social protection policies that can offer a better safety net to protect households from the stress or anxiety caused by not being economically prepared to face different economic shocks in the future.",

Because I use assets as a stock of material resources that can support the current consumption of a household, it is appropriate to equivalise it in the same way as household income is equivalised (OECD, 2013, p. 141) . Therefore, to account for different disposable income and asset requirements for different family sizes, I equivalise both income and assets using the scale that is equivalent to the household size to the power of 0.7. 7 I break down the estimates of the Multidimensional Economic Insecurity Index by individual characteristics such as gender, age and education level and household characteristics such as family type (couple or single, with or without children, or lone person), size of the household, housing (outright owner or owner with mortgage or tenant) and location (regions). 5 The SHF methodological documents, reports and databases can be accessed through the following link: https:// www. bcent ral. cl/ finan ciera-de-hogar es. 6 These characteristics have made it possible to include the Chilean SHF in the OECD Wealth Distribution Database, which has been used for comparative studies on households' wealth inequality (Balestra & Tonkin, 2018; Murtin & d'Ercole, 2015; OECD, 2013) . 7 The use of equivalence scales for the estimation of household income in Chile began in 2013.

The first dimension is the risk of the household experiencing potential events related to negative economic consequences such as unemployment, losses in asset values, or unexpected medical expenses. The second dimension is the lack of household economic buffers, which generates stress such as not having enough assets to face an event that decreases incomes or increases expenses, or not having access to social protection mechanisms to offset these economic losses.",

I use a probit model, in which the dependant variable takes the value 1 if the household faced any economic event that triggered a sharp drop in income or a sharp increase in their expenses in t \u2212 1 , and 0 otherwise. 9 Assuming the relation stays the same for the next period, I attached to each household the predicted probability calculated using the characteristics at the current period and coefficients from the regression of that year. I classify a household as income insecure if the risk of an unexpected economic event is situated above a threshold. I follow a data driven strategy to define the cut-off (Romaguera de la Cruz, 2017). I establish the 70th percentile of predicted probabilities as a threshold because it is the cut-off that is closest to the observed values after doing sensitivity analyses for different thresholds. In this way, I differ from authors who have measured a similar economic insecurity dimension (a drop in household income) in their multidimensional index following the proposal of Hacker et al. (2010) . 10",

For this reason, the vulnerability indicator focuses on over-indebtedness of consumption. In the SFH, respondents report the household's consumer debt amount (e.g., bank consumer loans, bank credit cards, and retailers' credit cards) and its financial burden. 11 I follow Disney et al. (2008) strategy to define when a household is over-indebted. These authors suggest that if a family spends more than a certain threshold of its total monthly income on unsecured debt repayments, it should be classified as over-indebted. 12 The steps to identify if a household is over-indebted are two. First, I calculate the financial burden relative to the monthly household income. It corresponds to the ratio of the monthly repayment of unsecured debt to monthly household disposable income. Second, I use a 40 per cent threshold to define over-indebtedness. This cut-off is higher than the one suggested by Disney (25 per cent) but similar to the threshold used by Hojman et al. (2016) . I used a statistical optimality criterion to obtain the latter. To sum up, households spending more than 40 per cent of their monthly disposable income on consumer debt repayments are considered over-indebted in this vulnerability indicator.",

The SFH collects information on household wealth, such as assets and liabilities, which allows using a non-housing wealth as a household asset measure. Then, I define the wealth measure as the difference between total assets and liabilities (without considering any wealth or debt related to the primary residence). Although several studies use liquid assets in the asset-poverty operationalisation (Balestra & Tonkin, 2018; Hacker et al., 2014) , I decided not to use this in the case of Chile for two reasons. First, when applying the liquid assets measure to Chile, 9 out of 10 households fell into asset poverty in the 10 years analysed (2007/2017) . Hence, this definition provides little information for middle-high income country contexts like the Chilean. Second, including tangible assets such as vehicles in the operationalisation of asset-poverty allows for considering, for instance, selling the car as a concrete and feasible strategy of the household to address an income shock in this type of national context. The second step is to choose both a poverty line and the length of time where a household can live only with the liquidity of its assets without falling into poverty. I use the relative poverty line suggested by the OECD to compare the poverty rate among its countries members. It corresponds to the half of median household equivalised income of the total population. For the period threshold, I use 3 months. It is a less demanding cut-off than 6 months and is commonly used to measure asset poverty. 13 In summary, for this vulnerability indicator, a household is asset poor if its non-housing wealth is less than the value of three poverty lines.",

The empirical strategy is to adapt their approach to the construction of a multidimensional index of economic insecurity. 14 Economic insecurity also has been measured from a multidimensional perspective following Alkire and Foster (2011) approach in north-western countries. The first time was in the U.S. using cross-sections and panel data from the Survey of Consumer Finances between 1989 and 2009 (Bucks, 2011) , and recently in 27 EU countries, using longitudinal EU-SILC data from 2009 to 2016 (Cant\u00f3, Garc\u00eda-P\u00e9rez, & Romaguera-de-la-Cruz, 2020) . 15 The approach that I follow has three parts: (i) the identification of households that are economically insecure, (ii) the aggregation of the different indicators into a scalar value, and (iii) the selection of dimensional weights for each indicator.",

When combining all of the years, 8 out of 10 households are classified as economically insecure in at least one of the four measures during the decade studied. Half of the population is classified as economically insecure when considering two or more vulnerabilities. When using a more demanding criterion, that is, three or more vulnerabilities, 13.9 per cent are economically insecure, and only 1.6 per cent of households are in a situation of insecurity in the four indicators.",

The indicator that measures the risk of households facing an economic shock presents a significant negative tendency during the period analysed, despite the increase from 31.5 per cent to 38.5 per cent between 2014 and 2017. This indicator appears coupled with the changes in national unemployment and GDP growth rates. Figure 1 shows that after the economic crisis in 2008, the annual unemployment rate rose to 11.3 per cent in 2009, and then began to decline during the economic expansion period, reaching 6.2 per cent in 2013. Since then the rate of unemployment has slightly increased. Likewise, the economic growth recovered by 2010, reaching similar rates to that before the financial crisis; it then fluctuated at around 5.5 per cent per year until 2013, after which time there was a substantial decline (about 1.7 per cent annually). Concerning the lack of protection of households to offset an economic loss, significant improvements are observed. The proportion of households with workers without access to social protection mechanisms or non-workers decreased from 34. The tendencies of these three measures of household buffers to offset an unexpected economic loss can be somewhat contrasted with macro indicators. For instance, the asset poor households follow the macro changes in the economy and labour market (Fig. 1) . In the case of households with unprotected employment, it is not evident that this is related to a decrease in unemployment. This can be associated with either an increase in informal jobs or with an increase in the rate of labour-protected jobs. Figure 2 clarifies this point. Between 2010 and 2013, the proportion of informal work fell from 39.2 per cent to 34.9 per cent in the Chilean labour market. However, in the following years, the informality rate increased slightly, reaching 35.8 per cent in 2017. As to the level of households' overindebtedness, this indicator follows the trend of financial resources allocated by domestic money banks. Figure 2 shows that between 2010 and 2017, the bank private credit rate increased by 13.2 per cent, peaking at 80.6 per cent in 2015. Table 3 shows the association between economic insecurity measures. A third of households with unprotected workers or non-workers are at risk of facing an unexpected economic shock. In the case of the over-indebtedness indicator, 46 per cent of households have a high probability of experiencing an event that generates an economic loss. As to the asset poverty indicator, 44.5 per cent of households in this situation are at risk of having a significant income drop or higher expenses in the near future. It is worth noting that the strongest correlation is between asset poverty and unexpected income shocks at 0.21 (see Table 8 in the appendix). This minimises the problem of double counting, which, as I will discuss in the next section, is one of the critiques to multidimensional approaches.",

            "text": "The results at the household level of the economic insecurity measures are presented below, and why these results justify using the MEII to understand the economic insecurity in Chile are discussed. Figure 3 shows the aggregate measure ( M 0 ) of the MEII for different thresholds ( k ). For the years 2007 and 2011, the confidence intervals overlap for each of the cut-offs, thereby presenting no significant differences in the M 0 . For k = 1, the Table 4 shows the aggregate measures for the MEII ( H , I , and M 0 ) for k = 2. The changes in the adjusted multidimensional economic insecurity rate ( M 0 ) are explained more by variations in the incidence ( H ) (over 12 per cent between 2007 and 2017), than by changes in the intensity ( I ) of the vulnerabilities (less than 3 per cent for the same period). However, although the level of economic insecurity taken in 2007 and 2011 was high (more than half of the population) and did not change, its evolution in the subsequent years shows U-shaped behaviour where a significant fall in H between 2011 and 2014 follows an increase between 2014 and 2017. This result raises the question of what the contribution of each of the indicators is to M 0 , and how this contribution changed over the decade studied. (2007, 2011, 2014 and 2017) higher income deciles. Panel A in Fig. 5 shows that during the years 2007 and 2011, the average incidence of the MEII was around 80 per cent for the first two income decile groups, while in the two highest income decile groups (9 and 10) was 12 per cent. The proportion of economic insecurity in the upper part of the distribution contrasts with the results from a recent study that has carried out a similar analysis using a multidimensional index developed by Romaguera de la Cruz (2020). This author found that in Spain, France and Sweden, the M 0 for deciles 9 and 10 was less than 1 per cent. Although this comparison is not strictly accurate since the period analysed was between 2009/2015 and the index was not built with the same indicators, it allows for emphasising the fact that economic insecurity in Chile is not bounded to the lower income groups. This result is in line with evidence collected through qualitative studies in Chile that show a pervasive fear experienced by the middle-upper class of not remaining in their social position due to economic problems (Araujo & Martuccelli, 2011) . In a context of a weak welfare state offering low-quality services, the upper-middle class in Chile has turned to private providers of services such as education and health (M\u00e9ndez & Gayo, 2019) . Further, P\u00e9rez-Roa and Ayala (2020) find that young professionals, who recently joined the high-income ranks, tend to be economically fragile due to their deep indebtedness (particularly among those who received post-secondary loans).",

The highest income decile groups (9 and 10) show no significant changes.

Taking advantage of the decomposition properties of one of the MEII's aggregated measures, I analyse the contribution of the dimensions to economic insecurity according to households' position in the distribution of income.

The indicator unprotected employment or non-workers in the household is important in the lower part of the income distribution, and its contribution falls in the highest deciles.

From the perspective of public policy design, this information is relevant because it allows for identifying where and how to focus public resources to reduce household stress due to economic vulnerabilities, thus complementing other welfare measures that are traditionally used in the targeting of social policies. Figure 6 shows the incidence of economic insecurity in Chile between 2007 and 2017, broken down by population subgroup. The three groups with the highest rate of economic insecurity are households composed by (i) a single mother with children; (ii) couple with (2007, 2011, 2014 and 2017) children, and (iii) a single pensioner. Around 8 out of 10 single mother with children households experienced economic insecurity during the decade analysed. The other two subgroups show rates close to 65 per cent in 2007. Although by 2017 these rates had declined to around 52 per cent. The high economic insecurity of these three types of families correlates with other welfare deprivation measures such as vulnerability to income poverty (L\u00f3pez-Calva & Ortiz-Juarez, 2014) . In this way, the application of the MEII informs policymakers that more than half of these households have been under economic stress during the last decade in Chile.",

An explanation of this result could be the gender inequalities that the Chilean labour market exhibits (participation, stability and wages). Second, the age of the head of the household was not a significant variable. This result shows that the economic insecurity throughout the decade was transverse to the life cycle of households. Finally, it is worth noting that households with heads of households that have a university degree have a significantly reduced risk of being economically vulnerable. The AME for heads of households with a university degree was 26.0 percentage points. 20 As to the variables related to households' characteristics, i.e. type of family, number of children, number of members working, the results in Table 6 show that two types of households have a higher risk of being economically insecure compared to households with couples without children. In the case of single mother with children, the risk rises by 27.3 percentage points, while for couples with children, it increases by 11.8 percentage points. These results are aligned with those presented in Fig. 6 , providing significant evidence of the need to direct support through tailored policies to these types of families to alleviate the stress and anxiety they experience. It is important to mention that during the last decade, Chile has been increasing the cash transfer through its family benefit programs, reaching 0.7 per cent of GDP in 2015 (Tromben & Podest\u00e1, 2019, p. 59) .

By considering both incidence and intensity, an adjusted rate of average economic insecurity of 0.286 is obtained. Although in the period of the economic crisis the level of insecurity did not change (measures taken in 2007 and 2011), its evolution in the subsequent years shows U-shaped behaviour where a significant fall in economic insecurity between 2011 and 2014 is followed by an increase between 2014 and 2017. This result shows a negative correlation with the country's economic cycle. Other macroeconomic indicators also correlate with some of the indicators that make up the MEII, for example, the reduction of the levels of labour informality with the unprotected unemployment indicator, and the constant increase in the bank private credit rate with the over-indebtedness indicator.",

It is worth noting that in 2015 the OECD ranked Chile as having the greatest economic vulnerability among its members, for almost 8 out of every 10 Chileans did not have liquid financial wealth to face a sudden adverse economic shock.

The question that arises is, what is the base level of hazard that as a society we want to have? In the case of Chile, to a certain extent, the state shares with people the financial risk of hazards such as unemployment or illness, through programmes such as unemployment insurance or public health insurance. Households decide how to cope with the additional costs of an illness or unemployment taking into consideration information about programme benefits (if eligible) and their own resources. However, regardless of the level of risk aversion on the part of the household, social policies should be able to effectively address economically insecure households, generating a more complete social welfare system than the current one.",

The weights given to the different sources of stress that the household has due to economic vulnerabilities are a determining factor in the definition of the index I propose. 21 There are several approaches to setting weights, which can be grouped into two types. The first are the datadriven approaches, which let the data 'speak for themselves' and depend solely on the distribution that the data being analysed provides. That is, data-driven weights are based on neither theoretical criteria nor value judgements regarding what the trade-offs should be between the dimensions and indicators. The second are the normative approaches, which define the weights based only on value judgements or conceptual frameworks of the dimensions of the phenomenon studied rather than the information that the distribution of the data matrix can provide (Table 7) .",

(2015) to build the multidimensional index of economic insecurity in Australia) or frequency-based weights (used by Romaguera de la Cruz (2020) in her index for Spain, France and Sweden). First, as mentioned in the previous section, the indicators that I use for Chile do not have a high Table 7 Average marginal effects on the probability of a household facing a large drop in income or a sharp increase in its expenses for significant variables Source: Author's calculations based on the Chilean Survey of Household Finances (2007, 2011, 2014 and 2017) I present average marginal effects for probit estimations in which the dependent variable is a large drop in household income or a sharp increase in its expenses ***Significance at 10 percent; ** significance at 5 percent; * significance at 1 percent correlation with each other, minimising the problem of double counting, which can capture the same latent dimension for two highly correlated indicators. The use of techniques based on principal component analysis has some drawbacks such as the difficulty in interpreting the combination between the indicators of the index, and in assigning a low weight to the dimensions that show a weak correlation, relying on mechanic justifications rather than theoretical ones (Decancq & Lugo, 2013) . Second, in countries like Chile that show a high percentage of economic vulnerability in all the indicators, using frequency-based weights has no justification. The reason for using frequency-based weights is that households attach greater importance to vulnerabilities that do not affect most households. Besides, there are situations in which one dimension may have a significant impact on the population, but this does not mean the others with a lower impact are less important. For example, Brandolini (2007) found this type of inconsistency between dimensions such as health and education when using frequency-based weights to calculate a well-being index in Italy.",

It is recommended when the dimensions used in the index are considered equally important or when dimensions that do not overlap are included. In my framework, the dimensions contain both characteristics. First, the vulnerability indicators are not highly correlated (see Table 8 in the appendix). Second, each dimension has an adverse effect on the well-being of a household, and, to the best of my knowledge, there are no studies that have determined that an economic vulnerability (e.g., over-indebtedness) causes more stress or anxiety in the household members than another (e.g., unprotected employment). Therefore, by applying the same weight to each indicator of economic insecurity, I can treat them in the same way.",

The changes in the compositions of the other three dimensions become more apparent from 2011 onwards; the contribution of economic shocks increases, and the lack of buffers (asset poverty and unprotected employment) decreases. In 2017 the relative M 0 composition of these three dimensions was 28.8, 39.4 and 18.1 per cent respectively.Figure 5shows the aggregate MEII measures for the years 2007, 2011, 2014, 2017 by income decile group. The results show two relevant phenomena. First, economic insecurity affects the whole population. As expected, the economic insecurity is much higher in the lower part of the income distribution and decreases when moving to the",
