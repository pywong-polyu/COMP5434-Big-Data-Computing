We aimed to develop a novel model and implement it in a freely accessible web application. Design We built an SIR-type compartmental model with two additional compartments: D (deceased patients); L (individuals who will die but who will not infect anybody due to social or medical isolation) and integration of a time-dependent transmission rate and a periodical weekly component linked to the way in which cases and deaths are reported. Results The model was implemented in a web application (as of 2 June 2020). It was shown to be able to accurately capture the changes in the dynamics of the pandemic for 20 countries whatever the type of pandemic spread or containment measures: for instance, the model explains 97% of the variance of US data (daily cases) and predicts the number of deaths at a 2-week horizon with an error of 1%. Conclusions In early performance evaluation, our model showed a high level of accuracy between prediction and observed data. Such a tool might be used by the global community to follow the spread of the pandemic.",

It has led governments to take both public measures for population containment and often a resetting of healthcare organisation in order to be able to absorb the peak of patients in particular for critical care. Since the inception of the outbreak, all stakeholders seemed keen to access to reliable and 'living' information regarding the evolution of cases, hospitalisations and deaths in their countries as well as in others. Cross-area comparisons were made to understand some characteristics of this novel epidemic. 1 2 Also, being able to predict at least in the short term, the evolution of the main outcome indicators has been a relentless objective of care for providers and decision-makers. A single tool providing such an aid would be likely to, respectively, inform people and enlighten relevant stakeholders to anticipate the needed measures, in particular regarding the steering of care and social measures. We therefore developed such an online tool, intended to be an adaptive model, that is, able to adapt to new early data so as to refine its prediction and be freely accessible to the community.",

[6] [7] [8] The more complex these models are, the more parameters they depend on. A classic method then consists of fixing the value of some of these parameters to values found in the literature and modifying the other parameters in order to obtain simulations with dynamics that are similar to those of the data. Our approach was different: our main objective was to develop an epidemiological model that fits the observed data as closely as possible, while at the same time being as simple as possible. However, we did not aim to develop an empirical model that looks like the data (eg, using a polynomial model): the model and its parameters must have a real epidemiological interpretation, in terms of transition from one state to another or length of stay in a state. On the one hand, we made the hypothesis that the number of contagious individuals in the population was negligible as compared with the population size, which is realistic as the latest studies suggested an infection rate of around 5% in most countries. 9 This hypothesis allowed us to ignore the compartment S of the model. On the other hand, we had to take into account the fact that not all patients recovered but that a certain proportion died. We therefore introduced a compartment D corresponding to the deceased patients.",

Our model has several strengths as compared with others. First, it is adaptive and fits the observed data, through a mechanistic modelling, even though we acknowledge that many other models are also adaptive, notably those analysed under the control theory framework. Second, it appears to be validated by the data, with good short-term predictions in all tested cases, as shown in the figures and as it can be seen on the online tool. For instance, the model early showed that Sweden, a country in which limited public measures have raised a national and international controversy, would rapidly reach a cumulated number of deaths of 4000. 15 Third, it is a parsimonious model, as very few parameters are needed to describe the outcome of interest, and the prediction proved stable over time. Fourth, we implemented it as an open-access interactive tool, so as to make it operational for any relevant stakeholder for the immediate benefit of the scientific and general community in the context of the COVID-19 outbreak. Fifth, it is designed to be updated on a regular basis, ideally on a daily basis, with the possible incorporation of new countries over time. Last, it can also be seen as a monitoring tool. Also, the current work focuses on what happened between early March and early June 2020. Indeed, this period corresponds to what has been widely called the 'first wave' of the COVID-19 pandemic in most European countries. We have chosen to cover this period because various parameters related to the dynamic of the pandemic (lethality rate, number of tests performed, infection rate, etc) seem to have changed significantly afterwards.",
