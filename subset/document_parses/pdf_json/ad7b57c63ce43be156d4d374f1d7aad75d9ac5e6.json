Other components commonly included in self-management programs include cognitive behavioral therapy, mind-body exercise (yoga and tai-chi), aquatic exercise and use of assistive walking devices [6] [7] [8] [9] . As pain is often the predominant symptom and a cause of significant burden, providing pain-management support is crucial [12] . Self-management programs that encompass patient education and include a cognitive behavioural component are widely recommended, and have been found to reduce pain [13, 14] , enhance physical function [13] and increase self-efficacy [15] .",

The search included a combination of Medical Subject Heading (MeSH) terms and free text keywords relating to OA, digital-based, self-management interventions. The search strategy was developed in consultation with an institutional librarian. An example search strategy is reported in Additional file 1 and was adapted for the specific requirements of each database.

Digital interventions included those that were online (website) or a mobile phone application. We included interventions that utilised a selfmanagement program, as defined by Lorig and Holman [24] . We included randomised controlled trials (RCT) with any form of control group (e.g. waitlist, treatment as usual, active controls, etc.) that reported any measure of feasibility or acceptability. Studies were excluded when participants were in an in-patient setting (hospital, nursing home or care institution), or had received surgery, and studies that utilised a supervised intervention (faceto-face or telehealth) as the primary component.",

Ten studies reported a higher numbers of female participants (range, 56-100%). The mean age of participants ranged from 54 to 68 years. The sample size of the studies ranged from 40 to 427. Four studies included a follow-up at 12-months [15, 26, 31, 34] , one at 9 months [28] and the remaining six studies had no follow-up [25, 27, 29, 30, 32, 33] . The control groups varied amongst included studies. Four studies provided education to their control group [27, 28, 30, 31] , one provided a home-based exercise program [25] , one provided usual physical therapy [34] , two included a waitlist control group [15, 26] and three studies did not provide anything to their control group [29, 32, 33] . In addition to a control group, two studies also included a physical therapy group, which included individualised home exercise programs. Pain was the most commonly reported outcome used by authors to assess the effectiveness of the interventions [25, 28, 29, [32] [33] [34] .",

Similarly, there was a dropout rate of 5% after a 6-week intervention [25] . One exception was a 6-week intervention, which recorded the second largest dropout rate at 28%, however, this study lost approximately 20% of participants due to COVID-19 lockdowns preventing post-intervention testing [29] .

All interventions were, however, multi-component, included alerts and monitoring, and all but one intervention included physical activity. It appears that, irrespective of the content of the self-management interventions, there was a relatively high adherence and low attrition to the online programs, with the majority of studies reporting a dropout rate of less than 20%. It was, however, noted that interventions of longer duration tended to have higher dropout rates. Therefore, future studies should address barriers to long-term adherence to improve the impact of conservative, cost-effective therapy for individuals with OA.",

Despite weight management also being considered a core component of OA management, surprisingly, less than 40% of studies included this topic [7, 8] . It is not clear why weight management was not covered in all programs, particularly since all studies reported a mean BMI > 25 kg/m 2 , which indicates that most participants were overweight or obese, and likely increasing the progression of osteoarthritis [37] . The majority of the interventions also focused specifically on either knee or hip OA, with only four designed for both. Although the management of OA in these two joints is very similar, there are slight differences, particularly in regards to exercise prescription [7, 11] . The duration of the interventions also varied greatly making it difficult to determine factors that may promote long-term adherence. Furthermore, only two studies reported adherence to the program between the end of the intervention and follow-up, both reporting a further decrease of ~ 20% adherence to the program. It is important that future studies measure long-term adherence to the intervention.",

Overall we found that, unlike other digital interventions, which commonly report adherence rates of only around 50% [38, 39] , studies included in this review typically reported adherence rates of 70% or greater. Three studies that reported high adherence utilised pain-coping skills training. The pain-coping skills training uses cognitive behavioural therapy and behaviour change principles to help individuals manage OA pain [40] . Cognitive behavioural therapy has been found to be beneficial for a range of health conditions including chronic pain [41] , nonspecific back pain [42] , mental disorders [43] and fibromyalgia [44] . The Osteoarthritis Research Society International guidelines also recommend cognitive behavioural therapy when combined with a component of exercise for individuals with knee OA [8] . Furthermore, a secondary analysis of one of these studies indicated that participants reported that they were better able to cope with the pain due to the pain-coping techniques and training utilised [45] . Autonomous motivation is an important predictor of health behaviour change and maintenance [46] . Another potential reason why adherence rates were relatively high in these studies is the self-selection of participants. Participants were recruited via advertisements and letters of invitations introducing self-selection bias, suggesting that those willing to participate in an online intervention are more willing to make a lifestyle change and therefore more likely to adhere to the intervention compared to those recruited from an inpatient setting or hospital waiting list [47] .",

However, one of these studies was impacted by COVID-19 lockdowns, preventing approximately 20% of participants from completing post-intervention testing, inflating the dropout rate [29] . The other studies with higher dropout rates had relatively long interventions of 16 weeks or greater, suggesting the prolonged study length may have contributed to higher dropout rates. Notably, one 26 week intervention with high attrition rates also reported the lowest SUS score [32] . In contrast, two studies with interventions of 12 and 24 weeks reported low dropout rates [28, 31] . Although speculative, the fact that both studies were multidisciplinary, comprehensive interventions that utilised a combination of physical activity, education, pain management and cognitive behavioural therapy could have contributed to lower attrition rates.",

Digital-based interventions are also more cost-effective compared to face-to-face interventions and reduce traditional barriers to treatment such as time scheduling, missing work and travel [52] . A challenge with digital interventions is that many are typically delivered only in one language and often require a certain level of literacy. Given the cultural diversity in most countries, the potential reach of these online self-management interventions will be limited if they are not developed to accommodate for individuals from linguistically diverse backgrounds. Furthermore, most self-management interventions are primarily available through participation in clinical trial evaluations. Hence, making these interventions available to the wider population could be beneficial for reducing the burden on individuals with OA and on the healthcare system.",

Therefore, future research is required to determine whether knee and hip OA have different needs, in order to encourage adherence and reduce attrition to an intervention. Furthermore, some studies did not adequately report adherence or program usage, which made it difficult to determine the impact of the interventions on these outcomes. It is important for future studies to assess and report on intervention adherence and program usage in order to determine which characteristics are successful for improving these outcomes. In addition, very few studies stated whether their intervention used was designed following a theoretical framework. This information is crucial for understanding behaviour change and adherence. The application of theory is advocated as an integral step in intervention design and evaluation [53] . Although it is likely that the included studies were grounded in appropriate theories, many made no mention of such. Future studies should specifically state which theories were targeted in the development of the digital self-management interventions for individuals with OA in order to understand whether these may have impacted adherence. Lastly, studies analysing satisfaction and usability used various outcome measures, making it difficult to compare the results and form conclusions. Future studies should report participant satisfaction and use validated outcomes measures such as the SUS to determine the level of participant satisfaction and inform future interventions.",

Given the flexibility, availability and accessibility of these programs, whilst maintaining participant adherence, digital self-management interventions could offer an opportunity for individuals with OA to self-manage symptoms and reduce their need for more invasive treatments. Future digital self-management interventions should be multi-component and include physical activity and other key aspects of osteoarthritis management such as weight management, education and cognitivebehavioural approaches to pain management to increase engagement with the intervention. In addition, future studies should consider strategies to promote long-term adherence and determine whether long-term adherence to lifestyle behaviours results in ongoing reductions in pain.",
