Where feasible, studies are considering remote data collection by telephone or webbased conferencing. [1] [2] [3] However, this approach is often not possible when performing anthropomorphic measurements, specimen collection or when investigators need to make other direct observations. Even temporary suspension of research activities can potentially cause harm if investigators are evaluating an intervention that is hypothesized to be bene cial. Further, the suspension of data collection could result in loss of study power and potentially introduce bias. Every day, we are gaining a greater understanding of the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2, and this knowledge increases our ability to safely resume a wide variety of non-COVID-19 related research activities. [3, 4] Where local law or institutional regulations allow activities to restart, investigators need to evaluate the risks and bene ts to both research staff and participants of resuming data collection. To safely conduct study activities, researchers need to develop standardized procedures that are based on realistic assessment of these risks, provide guidance on where and when they are manageable as well as how to minimize the risk with physical distance measures and appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE).",

[20] It is unclear how long the virus remains in the air. [21] [22] [23] Fomites from surface contact may also contribute to transmission, but are likely a smaller risk. [24, 25] Evidence of SARS-CoV-2 presence has been detected in urine, stool, breast milk, semen and blood, but we are not aware of documented transmission through such specimens at the time of this publication. [21, [26] [27] [28] [29] Furthermore, the risk of transmission is greatest in the two days preceding onset of symptoms and continues afterward for at least ten days, and up to twenty days in immunosuppressed patients. [12, 13] Because documented asymptomatic carriage has been widely reported, we assumed that any staff member, collaborator or community participant might be shedding the virus. [30] Small children (especially infants) appear to be infected at the same rate as adults, but have more mild disease and thus may be unknowingly spreading disease. [31] We agreed that because viral transmissibility and the true prevalence of COVID-19 are not clearly known in any of our study sites due to limited testing, we erred on the side of caution and assumed moderate to substantial incidence of disease in most settings. This risk is de ned as largescale, uncontrolled or controlled community transmission. [32] We assessed each HAPIN data collection activity among each group of participants (pregnant woman, infant, non-pregnant adult woman) because the risks may vary with each age group. Data collection activities were graded and agreed upon by the team of scientists. Local site investigators were asked to report perceived concerns by staff and participants in their communities. Risk factors and de nitions were presented to the HAPIN steering committee for feedback before adoption. Standard Operating Procedures were developed for the resumption of study activities and included guidance on screening staff and participants for Covid-19 symptoms, transporting staff in project vehicles, cleaning equipment and surfaces, conducting home visits and health facility survelliance, and quarantining for suspected exposures to the virus.

Biological sample collection spanned a range of assigned risk due to differences in participant-staff interaction. The activities with the highest level of risk were those that potentially aerosolize the virus during the procedure. For example, urine collection requires minimal contact (i.e., eld workers instruct the participant to collect and store the urine sample until it can be retreived) resulting in low risk to both the participant and the study staff. However, dried blood spot collection from infants (who are unable to wear a mask and often cry during the procedure) could feasibly put eld workers at high risk. To illustrate, examples of two procedures are provided in Table 1 and in context of all procedures in Table 5a of the supplement. We also identi ed several activities that are not part of our protocol, but that we believe would pose unmanageable risks (e.g. bronchoscopy, sputum inducting procedures, cardiopulmonary resusitation) for routine research in the pandemic context (Table 2 ).",

However, prior to the deployment of tools such as ours, researchers, in association with community members, IRBs, DSMBs, and funders need to evaluate the importance of any activity related to the primary aims of a trial against the associated risk. Necessarily, local health regulations related to mobility, home or clinic visits by researchers may supersede any of these judgments.",

After some discussion, we chose to make the risk-bene t calculation and decisions regarding which activities to suspend a secondary process because it requires a more complex judgment with potentially more subjectivity across investigators and local staff. Among the criteria we used to examine potential bene ts of risky activities are whether or not the aim of any given procedure is to support a primary vs secondary or tertiary (exploratory) outcome of the trial protocol. Similarly, ancillary studies can potentially present additional risks above and beyond the primary outcomes. Further, if a measure can be eliminated in favor of a slightly less risky measure toward the same outcome we chose the former. For example, the Steering Committee has identi ed certain activities that are high risk (level 3) and, under the strain of the current conditions, may compromise the integrity of the trial's main goals and relevant data obtainable under these procedures can be obtained through lower risk methods (e.g. oral rinse and venous blood draw -level 2) (Table 5a of the online   supplement) .

We continued collecting data by telephone when possible. When in-person contact was permitted by local IRBs, we used our framework to guide the appropriate protocols. During home visits, we provide adult participants and family members with paper or cloth masks to wear. Study staff maintain at least a two-meter distance between themselves and participants when collecting survey data, and only approach participants for hands-on activities such as blood pressure measurement, certain biological samples, or placing personal air pollution monitoring equipment. We attempt to perform as many procedures as possible outdoors. Participants are screened prior to arrival to the home for symptoms of COVID-19 and staff are screened daily and asked to stay home if there is any concern for COVID-19. When this has occurred, we have followed local guidance on when the quarantine period is complete. Staff regularly wash their hands with soap and water, and bring containers of water to house visits if water is not available, antibacterial hand gel is also used before and after each collection and house visit. If designated PPE is not available or cannot be used properly at any time, we postpone the activity. Similarly, our rules require goggles or a face shield for certain procedures, but participants (especially children) may nd these terrifying, especially when combined with masks and gloves. In these situations, it may not be possible to complete the work as planned, and local staff have the autonomy and responsibility to decide whether any activity should proceed.

While the pandemic has been disruptive to our research, we believe there may also be some bene ts from the shift in some data collection methods. For example, collecting data via telephone instead of visiting in-person increases time use e ciency for staff and decreases the burden of household visits on participants. Costs are lower, with less fuel used to travel via truck or motorbike to distant participant homes. On the other hand, telephone surveys may introduce uncertainty, if questions are complex in nature and may lead to poor response rates or lower quality data. We acknowledge that we have been able to resume study activities in some of our research sites, and attribute this to building relationships with participants over the past several years and the commitment of our local teams and collaborating institutions.",
