In this study, we estimated the impact of delays in diagnosis on cancer survival outcomes in four major tumour types.",

We use a routes-to-diagnosis framework to estimate the impact of diagnostic delays over a 12-month period from the commencement of physical distancing measures, on March 16, 2020, up to 1, 3, and 5 years after diagnosis. To model the subsequent impact of diagnostic delays on survival, we reallocated patients who were on screening and routine referral pathways to urgent and emergency pathways that are associated with more advanced stage of disease at diagnosis. We considered three reallocation scenarios representing the best to worst case scenarios and reflect actual changes in the diagnostic pathway being seen in the NHS, as of March 16, 2020, and estimated the impact on net survival at 1, 3, and 5 years after diagnosis to calculate the additional deaths that can be attributed to cancer, and the total years of life lost (YLLs) compared with pre-pandemic data.",

Across the three different scenarios, compared with pre-pandemic figures, we estimate a 7\u00b79-9\u00b76% increase in the number of deaths due to breast cancer up to year 5 after diagnosis, corresponding to between 281 (95% CI 266-295) and 344 (329-358) additional deaths. For colorectal cancer, we estimate 1445 (1392-1591) to 1563 (1534-1592) additional deaths, a 15\u00b73-16\u00b76% increase; for lung cancer, 1235 (1220-1254) to 1372 (1343-1401) additional deaths, a 4\u00b78-5\u00b73% increase; and for oesophageal cancer, 330 (324-335) to 342 (336-348) additional deaths, 5\u00b78-6\u00b70% increase up to 5 years after diagnosis. For these four tumour types, these data correspond with 3291-3621 additional deaths across the scenarios within 5 years. The total additional YLLs across these cancers is estimated to be 59 204-63 229 years.",

These patient groups include patients with cancer for whom timely diagnosis and the prompt initiation of treatment is vital for ensuring optimal outcomes. 2, 3 Since the beginning of the pandemic, multiple changes in the provision of cancer care from the point of diagnosis, including modification of treatment schedules (change in therapy, deferral, or omission), have been advised by professional bodies and commissioners of services globally. [4] [5] [6] [7] However, substantial heterogeneity has been seen in the imple mentation of these recommendations across providers nationally and internationally and for individual patients. Such variations in the extent of treatment delay, and in changes to treatment doses and schedules (including new treat ment techniques) mean that modelling of these variations in practice on cancer outcomes at a population level is challenging.",

Routine non-urgent diagnostic work initiated by referral from both primary care (general practitioners [GPs] ) and secondary care teams (eg, for radiology or endoscopic procedures 8 ) has been deferred across the UK. Cancer screening services have been suspended, and patients' only routes to diagnosis since lockdown began have been via urgent 2-week-wait referral pathways for suspected cancer initiated by the GP or through direct presentation to an emergency department. 9 Patients are eligible for these rapid access 2-week-wait pathways to access diagnostic investigations, on the basis of their age, symptom profile (eg, dysphagia), signs (eg, breast lump), or results of investigations (eg, iron deficiency anaemia) as specified by guidelines developed by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence. 9 However, since March, 2020, changes in health-seeking behaviour have been observed, with urgent 2-week-wait cancer referrals decreasing by up to 80% in response to physical distancing and concerns about contracting severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). 10 Additionally, some form of physical distancing is expected to continue for up to 12 months, which will probably further affect presentations to healthcare services. 11, 12 Quantifying the impact of delays in diagnosis on stage and prognosis is complex, but a routes-to-diagnosis approach provides a validated methodological framework for understanding their effect. Work by Elliss-Brookes and colleagues 13 showed that referral routes to diagnosis are characterised by differences in both stage at presentation and survival. For example, urgent 2-weekwait referrals for suspected cancer and emergency presentations are asso ciated with later stage of disease at diagnosis than diag noses via routine GP and secondary care referral routes and screening. Additionally, diagnosis after initial presen tation to an emergency department is consistently asso ciated with the worst survival outcomes compared with all other routes. 13 Given the changes in health-seeking behaviour and availability and access to diagnostic services as a result of the COVID-19 lockdown, these routes to diagnosis provide a framework for estimating the impact of these changes on stage migration and excess cancer mortality on the basis of patients moving to different referral routes during the pandemic.",

This combination of perceived risk and redeployment of staff will result in further delays, which could also affect survival, that are not included in our model. Our results also highlight the substantial proportion of patients diag nosed with cancer through routine outpatient referral pathways (30-40%) and the subsequent effect of deferral and delay in these referral pathways during the pandemic.

However, these effects are likely to be small when considering concerns about the overall shortfall in the number of new cancer diagnoses.

Any exit strategy from lockdown 27 therefore needs to include accurate and measured public health messaging that is tailored towards patients, GPs, and secondary care services that puts into perspective the risk of death from COVID-19 compared with other serious illnesses.

Furthermore, a central coordinating system for diagnostic investigations in a similar vein to a choose-and-book approach, whereby primary care physicians are able to refer patients to any NHS hospital, will optimise use of capacity. 28 For detection of bowel cancer, surgeons are increasingly using new tools such as the faecal immuno chemical test 29 to triage their patients for investigation to avoid unnecessary colonoscopy and CT imaging and therefore improving capacity in this diagnostic pathway.",

Additionally, recent work has pointed to a waiting time paradox, whereby quicker diagnosis is associated with later stage of presentation; this paradox confounds assessment of the impact of diagnostic delay on outcomes. 33, 34 Modelling the extent and duration of diagnostic delay at the population level is challenging because diagnostic delays are predicated on health system factors, such as access and availability of diagnostic capacity, and patient-level factors (awareness, symptoms, health-seeking behaviour). Our model accounts for both of these factors and is grounded in the reality of current service levels in the English NHS by providing best and worst case estimates.

            "text": "Our model assumes that disruptions due to the COVID-19 pandemic will affect timely access to routine and urgent diagnostic services and alter health-seeking behaviour for a 12-month period. These assumptions are likely given the changes in patterns of patient presentation and availability of diagnostic services observed since the start of lockdown. 1, 11, 12, 24, 25 Since beginning our modelling study, substantial reduction in 2-week-wait referrals have indeed been seen in the first 3 months, as we predicted in scenarios B and C. Scenario A conservatively considers no reduction in 2-week-wait referrals. Given the ongoing reductions in the volume of 2-week-wait referrals (estimates suggest a 40-50% reduction), 35 reductions are expected to continue for up to 6 months as predicted in scenario C because of the effects of pandemic lockdown measures on patients presenting to their GP or health-care provider. These measures include advice to minimise non-essential travel and the continued shielding of high-risk groups. 1, 12 Cancer Research UK has estimated that the first 10 weeks of the UK lockdown has already resulted in 2\u00b71 million deferred cancer screening investigations with 290 000 fewer people being referred on 2-week-wait pathways. 35 6 months after the implementation of physical distancing mea sures the backlog of patients with potential cancers awaiting investigation will be considerable, and health-care presentations will continue to be affected due to physical distancing measures that are expected to continue until 2021. 11, 12 Additionally, NHS hospital trusts suspended their routine diagnostic services at the start of lockdown, which is concerning because routine referral routes account for 30-40% of cancer diagnoses and the backlog in this pathway once routine services restart will include all patients still awaiting diagnostic investigations both from before and after lockdown started. Further competition for capacity will subsequently come from the increase in new referrals for suspected cancers on 2-weekwait referrals and those referred for investigation or follow up of seemingly benign health conditions. At the same time, diagnostic capacity has decreased for some procedures due the increased time taken per case since the introduction of new infection control measures. 36 Together, all these factors will increase the likelihood of patients becoming symptomatic and presenting via 2-week-wait referral or emergency pathways. Alternatively, if or when patients are diagnosed through routine pathways, the likelihood of stage migration and associated worse prognosis due to delays in diagnosis is increased.",

Additionally, these estimates do not consider the impact of treatment delay or suboptimal treatment on survival during the pandemic. 22 The proportions of patients presenting through different referral pathways has changed over time, with decreasing proportions of patients presenting via emergency depart ments in the past decade, which might also affect our results. 38 However, we consider the probable effect on the overall results to be small given the steady trajectories of improvements in patterns of presentation we have seen over the past 5 years. 37, 38 We did not analyse patients aged 85 years or older at diagnosis because competing events, such as deaths from other causes, are predominant in this population. Although delays in cancer diagnosis in older populations will lead to excess short-term cancer mortality, the effect on national population-levels is less likely to be affected.
