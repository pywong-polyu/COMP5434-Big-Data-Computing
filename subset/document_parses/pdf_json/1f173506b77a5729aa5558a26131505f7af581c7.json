As a surface-active material, a small number of AFPs have a tremendous influence on the growth of ice. Therefore, identifying novel AFPs is important to understand protein-ice interactions and create novel ice-binding domains. To date, predicting AFPs is difficult due to their low sequence similarity for the ice-binding domain and the lack of common features among different AFPs. Here, a computational engine was developed to predict the features of AFPs and reveal the most important 39 features for AFP identification, such as antifreeze-like/Nacetylneuraminic acid synthase C-terminal, insect AFP motif, C-type lectin-like, and EGF-like domain. With this newly presented computational method, a group of previously confirmed functional AFP motifs was screened out. This study has identified some potential new AFP motifs and contributes to understanding biological antifreeze mechanisms.",

AFPs are a group of effective proteins with unique antifreeze properties and typical structural and functional characteristics. From the molecular structural aspect, the current AFPs have originated from the sugar-bind domain of C-type lectins (CTLs) that usually depend on calcium ions. Despite the detailed classification of AFPs, their molecular structures still vary; some common structures are shared by almost all AFPs, and some are also found in the original CTLs such as disulfide bridges and cysteine residues [8] . This finding indicates that different AFPs may have similar evolutionary procedures, and their structures may be essential for their antifreeze property. This concept provides structural foundations for novel AFP predictions.",

AFPs help regulate the freezing point of certain aqueous solutions to provide a soluble and liquid microenvironment for essential biochemical reactions as firstly reported and confirmed in Dendroides canadensis [9] . In 2014, a detailed mechanism study used the Ginzburg-Landau-type approach to identify and validate a specific phenotype as the phase separation of a typical dynamic two-component system and confirmed that AFPs can inhibit the general water freezing procedures in vitro [10] .",

One of the largest obstacles in current AFP studies is the prediction of novel potential AFPs. Although AFPs share some simple structures such as disulfide bridges and cysteine residues, their sequence similarity is low. Hence, predicting novel AFPs according to previous computational methods is difficult. In this study, a computational engine is developed to predict AFP features. The 39 most important features for AFP identification have been revealed. Candidate features and signatures are extracted from a website called \"InterPro protein sequence analysis & classification\". These entries are converted to their protein domain by relying on features that represent protein families, domains, repeats, and specific functional sites. Based on the 39 features, the most common protein domains are antifreeze-like/N-acetylneuraminic acid synthase C-terminal, insect AFP motif, and CTL-like domain. This finding indicates that many important key features originated from the protein domains such as insect AFP motif and CTL-like domain. In addition, a group of previously confirmed functional AFP motifs is screened out by using the newly presented computational method.

Thus, the IFS method [17] was employed to extract discriminative features with the best performance for one classification algorithm (e.g., random forest (RF) [18] ). In accordance with the mRMR feature list F, a series of feature subsets F 1 , F 2 , . . . F N was generated, where F 1 = { f 1 }, F 2 = { f 1 , f 2 }, and so forth. A classifier can be built on each feature subset, where samples were represented by features in such a list. Then, 10-fold cross-validation [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] was adopted to evaluate the performance of all classifiers. Finally, the classifier with the best performance can be found and the corresponding feature subset was extracted. Such classifier was termed as the optimum classifier and features in the corresponding feature subset were called optimum features.",

In the bootstrap procedure, a training dataset containing N samples was repeatedly sampled for B times (B is the parameter representing the number of decision trees). For each decision tree, the randomly selected N samples with replacement constituted its training set, and a random feature subset was adopted to split the nodes of this decision tree. B decision trees were eventually grown. For a new sample, each decision tree provided a predicted class, and the predicted class of the RF was determined by majority voting.

The most previous methods directly extracted features from protein sequences, which contained limited function information of proteins. The functional domain is much more powerful to identify different properties of proteins because it directly contains the function information of proteins. Although AFP-Ensemble [11] also employed functional domain to represent proteins, it only adopted fifteen domains which were annotated to no less than ten proteins. In fact, those domains that were annotated to few proteins may still be important to identify AFPs. Among 39 optimum features (domains), 15 (~38.46%) domains were annotated to less than 10 AFPs or non-AFPs. We employed all domains and adopted an advanced feature selection method to extract essential domains, which were further used to construct the proposed RF classifier. It is an important reason why our classifier was much better than AFP-Ensemble and other methods.",

AFP, Type II Compared with type I AFPs, type II AFPs have different natural distribution patterns and are found in species such as sea ravens, smelt, and herring. With regard to structure, type II AFPs can also be regarded as the evolved CTLs with calcium ion-dependent functions. In a natural environment, the antifreeze capacity of herring and smelt can be attributed to type II AFPs [49] , indicating the biological basis of our feature classification. On the basis of the evolutionary routines of CTL domains, the type II AFP gene is suggested to be a typical and complicated evolved antifreeze subgroup from the classic CTLs [49] . Under differentiated selection pressures, type II AFPs share some common properties with the original CTLs and also contain some specific and unique structures, thus forming a new subgroup of antifreeze proteins. For instance, some type II AFPs such as those in sea ravens can remove the restriction of calcium ions and constitute a new non-calcium-reliant mechanism for the antifreeze processes [49] . Due to the complicated antifreeze structures, some of the identified terms of type II AFPs have been fully described, but the biological functions have not been revealed, including SPFH domain, Ydjl-like (IPR033880), Band7/SPFH domain superfamily (IPR036013), 5-formyltetrahydrofolate cyclo-ligase (IPR002698) and P-loop containing nucleoside triphosphate hydrolase (IPR027417).",

A group of complicated biological structure signatures, including multiple \u03b1helix, helices, and \u03b2-strands, have been identified in type III AFPs [5] . The first typical type III AFP was purified from a viviparous European eel named Zoarces viviparus [50] . Two isoforms of type III AFPs, namely, QAE1 (ZvAFP13) and SP (ZvAFP6) were also identified in such species, thus reflecting the diversity of this subtype. For their functional mechanisms, type III AFPs can promote the meiotic spindle morphology and the fertilization and blastocyst rates of sperm cells and embryos under freezing conditions [51] . According to a series of studies on the protective role of type III AFPs in reproductive cells [51] [52] [53] , this subtype can protect the cells, especially reproductive cells, from freezing to death and provide maximum maintenance on their reproductive capacity. Therefore, type III AFPs have also been applied to modify and evaluate sperm cryopreservation. A general description of antifreeze protein type III (IPR006013) and two summarized type III AFPs according to Pfam classification (Ice-binding protein as IPR021884, N-acetylneuraminic acid synthase, N-terminal as IPR013132) have been identified and predicted to be associated with AFPs.",
