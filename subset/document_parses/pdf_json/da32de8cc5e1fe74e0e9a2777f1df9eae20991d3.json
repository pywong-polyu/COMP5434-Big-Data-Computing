            "text": "Purpose This study aims at exploiting artificial intelligence (AI) for the identification, segmentation and quantification of COVID-19 pulmonary lesions. The limited data availability and the annotation quality are relevant factors in training AI-methods. We investigated the effects of using multiple datasets, heterogeneously populated and annotated according to different criteria. Methods We developed an automated analysis pipeline, the Lung Quant system, based on a cascade of two U-nets. The first one (U-net 1 ) is devoted to the identification of the lung parenchyma; the second one (U-net 2 ) acts on a bounding box enclosing the segmented lungs to identify the areas affected by COVID-19 lesions. Different public datasets were used to train the U-nets and to evaluate their segmentation performances, which have been quantified in terms of the Dice Similarity Coefficients. The accuracy in predicting the CT-Severity Score (CT-SS) of the Lung Quant system has been also evaluated. Results Both the volumetric DSC (vDSC) and the accuracy showed a dependency on the annotation quality of the released data samples. On an independent dataset (COVID-19-CT-Seg), both the vDSC and the surface DSC (sDSC) were measured between the masks predicted by Lung Quant system and the reference ones. The vDSC (sDSC) values of 0.95\u00b10.01 and 0.66\u00b10.13 (0.95\u00b10.02 and 0.76\u00b10.18, with 5 mm tolerance) were obtained for the segmentation of lungs and COVID-19 lesions, respectively. The system achieved an accuracy of 90% in CT-SS identification on this benchmark dataset. Conclusion We analysed the impact of using data samples with different annotation criteria in training an AI-based quantification system for pulmonary involvement in COVID-19 pneumonia. In terms of vDSC measures, the U-net segmentation strongly depends on the quality of the lesion annotations. Nevertheless, the CT-SS can be accurately predicted on independent test sets, demonstrating the satisfactory generalization ability of the Lung Quant.",

            "text": "The task of segmenting the abnormalities of the lung parenchyma related to COVID-19 infection is a typical segmentation problem that can be addressed with methods based on Deep Learning (DL). CT findings of patients with COVID-19 infection may include bilateral distribution of ground-glass opacifications (GGO), consolidations, crazypaving patterns, reversed halo sign and vascular enlargement [2] . Due to the extremely heterogeneous appearance of COVID-19 lesions in density, textural pattern, global shape and location in the lung, an analytical approach is definitely hard to code. The potential of DL-based segmentation approaches is particularly suited in this case, provided that a sufficient number of annotated examples are available for training the models. Few fully automated software tools devoted to this task have been recently proposed [4, 10, 11] . Lessmann et al. [10] developed a U-net model for lesion segmentation trained on semi-automatically annotated COVID-19 cases. The output of this system was then combined with the lung lobe segmentation algorithm reported in Xie et al. [14] . The approach proposed in Fang et al. [4] implements the automated lung segmentation method provided in the work of Hofmanninger et al. [7] , together with a lesion segmentation strategy based on multiscale feature extraction [5] . The specific problem related to the development of fully automated DL-based segmentation strategies with limited annotated data samples has been explicitly tackled by Ma et al. [11] . The authors studied how to train and evaluate a DL-based system for lung and COVID-19 lesion segmentation on poorly populated samples of CT scans. They also made the data publicly available, allowing for a fair comparison with their system.",

We extended the study proposed by Ma et al. [11] focusing our efforts in investigating and discussing the impact of using different datasets and different labelling styles. Data can be highly variable in terms of acquisition protocols and machines when they are gathered from different sources. This poses a serious problem of dependence of the segmentation performances on the training sample characteristics. Despite that advanced data harmonization strategies could mitigate this problem [6] , this approach is not applicable in absence of data acquisition information, as it is in this study for the available CT data. Nevertheless, DL methods, when trained with sufficiently large samples of heterogeneous data, can acquire the desired generalization ability by themselves. In our analysis, we implemented an inter-sample cross-validation method to train, test and evaluate the generalization ability of the LungQuant DL-based segmentation pipeline across differ-ent available datasets. Finally, we also quantified the effect of using larger datasets to train, validate and test this kind of algorithm.",

The currently available data, provided along with infection annotations, have been labelled following different guidelines and released in NifTI format. They do not contain complete acquisition and population information, and they have been stored according to different criteria (see the Supplementary Materials for further details). Some of the choices made during the DICOM to NifTI conversion may strongly affect the quality of data. For example, the MosMed dataset as described by Morozov et al. [12] preserves only one slice out of ten during this conversion. This operation results in a significantly loss of resolution with respect to the COVID-19 Challenge dataset. Questioning how much such conversion influences the quantitative analysis is important to improve not only the performance but also the possibility of comparing DL algorithm in a fair modality.",

The output of U-net 1 was refined using a connected component labelling strategy to remove small regions of the segmented mask not connected with the main objects identified as the lungs. We identified the connected components in the lung masks generated by U-net 1 , and we excluded those components whose number of voxels was below an empirically fixed threshold (see Supplementary Materials for further details). We then built for each CT a bounding box enclosing the refined segmented lungs, adding a conservative padding of 2.5 cm. The bounding boxes were used to crop the training images for U-net 2 , which has the same architecture as U-net 1 . Training In the compression path (left), the input is processed through convolutions, activation layers (ReLu) and instance normalization layers, while in the decompression one (right), in addition to those already mentioned, 3D Transpose Convolution (de-convolution) layers are also introduced U-net 2 to recognize the COVID-19 lesions on a conservative bounding box has two main advantages: it allows to restrict the action volume of the U-net to the region where the lung parenchyma is supposed to be, thus avoiding false-positive findings outside the chest; it facilitates the U-net training phase, as the dimensions of the lungs of different patients are standardized to focus the U-net learning process on the textural patterns characterizing the COVID-19 lesions. The cropped images were resized to a matrix of 200 \u00d7 150 \u00d7 100 voxels. We applied a windowing on the grey-level values of the CT scans to optimize the image contrast for the two segmentation problems: the [\u2212 1000, 1000] HU window range for the U-net 1 and the [\u2212 1000, 300] HU range for U-net 2 . The first window highlights the contrast between the lung parenchyma and the surrounding tissues, whereas the second one enhances the heterogeneous structure of the lung abnormalities related to the COVID-19 infection. We implemented a data augmentation strategy, relying on the most commonly used data augmentation techniques for DL (see Supplementary Materials for further details) to overcome the problem of having a limited amount of labelled data. We transformed the images with rotations, zooming, elastic transformations and adding Gaussian noise. The Lung Quant system returns the infection mask as the output of U-net 2 and the lung mask as the union between the output of U-net 1 and U-net 2 . This choice has been made a priori by design, as U-net 1 has been trained to segment the lungs relying on the available annotated data, which are almost totally of patients not affected by COVID-19 pneumonia. Thus, U-net 1 is expected to be unable to accurately segment the areas affected by GGO or consolidations; as also these areas are part of the lungs, they should be instead included in the mask.",

            "text": "We developed a fully automated quantification pipeline, the Lung Quant system, for the identification and segmentation of lungs and pulmonary lesions related to COVID-19 pneumonia in CT scans. The system returns the COVID-19 related lesions, the lung mask and the ratio between their volumes, which is converted into a CT Severity Score. The performance obtained against a voxel-wise segmentation ground truth was evaluated in terms of the vDSC, which provides a measure of the overlap between the predicted and the reference masks. The Lung Quant system achieved a vDSC of 0.95 \u00b1 0.01 in the lung segmentation task and of 0.66 \u00b1 0.13 in segmenting the COVID-19 related lesions on the fully annotated publicly available benchmark COVID-19-CT-Seg dataset of 10 CT scans. The Lung Quant has been evaluated also in terms of sDSC for different values of tolerance. The results obtained at a tolerance of 5 mm equal to 0.76 \u00b1 0.18 are satisfactory for our purpose, given the heterogeneity of the labelling process. Regarding the correct assignment of the CT-SS, the Lung Quant system showed an accuracy of 90% on the completely independent test set COVID-19-CT-Seg. Despite that this result is encouraging, it was obtained on a rather small independent test set; thus, a broader validation on larger data sample with more heterogeneous composition in terms of disease severity is required. Training DL algorithms requires a huge amount of labelled data. The lung segmentation task has been made feasible in this work thanks to the use of lung CT datasets collected for purposes different from the study of COVID-19 pneumonia. Training a segmentation system on these samples had the effect that when we use the trained network to process the CT scan of a patient with COVID-19 lesions, especially in case ground glass opacities and consolidation are very severe, the lung segmentation is not accurate anymore. In order to overcome this problem, the proposed Lung Quant system returns a lung mask which is the logical union between the output mask of the U-net 1 and the infection mask generated by the U-net 2 . The Lung Quant system can actually be improved whether lung masks annotation are available on subjects with COVID-19 lesions. A similar problem occurs for the segmentation of ground glass opacities and consolidations. The available data, in fact, are very unbalanced with respect to the severity of COVID-19 disease, and hence, the accuracy in segmenting the most severe case is worse. The current lack of a large dataset, collected by paying attention to adequately represent all categories of disease severity, limits the possibility to carry out accurate training of AI-based models. Finally, we found that the difference in the annotation and collection guidelines among datasets is an issue. Processing aggregated data from different sources can be difficult if labelling has been performed using different guidelines. CT scans should contain the acquisition parameters, usually stored in the DICOM header, when they are published. The lack of this information is a drawback of our study. If we had that data, we could study more in detail the dependence of the LungQuant performances on specific acquisition protocols or scanners. On the contrary, even with this information, it would not be possible to standardize the different annotation styles. The results of LungQuant (last 2 rows of Table 4 ) demonstrate its robustness across different datasets even without a dedicated preprocessing step to account for this information.",
