For a new disease there is often a pool of potential interventions and great interest in quickly determining which are efficacious. In such a setting, a phase III trial with aggressive futility monitoring is appealing. One method is stochastic curtailment, whereby treatments are discarded if conditional power to show a statistically significant difference by the end is less than a threshold (Lan et al. (1984) ) Another approach uses a beta spending function to spend the type II error rate as aggressively as desired (Pampallona et al. (2001) ). Another option is the multi-arm, multi-stage (MAMS) design, an early example of which was the Systemic Therapy in Advancing or Metastatic Prostate cancer: Evaluation of Drug Efficacy (STAMPEDE) trial eliminating arms failing to meet a minimum level of performance compared to control at interim analyses Sydes et al.

            "text": "The simplest approach uses two stages. In the first stage, treatments are discarded if they show little promising signal. A treatment that graduates past the first stage continues to a second stage. The combined data from the first and second stages allow for a definitive phase III evaluation. Since the first stage only serves to discard treatments, it can be thought of as an aggressive futility analysis, thus allowing a standard final analysis of both stages that completely ignores that a first stage Standard Phase III Trial occurred. Figure 1 shows a schematic of a sequence of 2-stage phase III trials that can evaluate 7 interventions with 3800 patients. For comparison, a sequence of single stage trials that always use 1000 patients would fully evaluate 3 interventions and be about 4/5 of the way through the 4th intervention with the same pool of 3800 patients. We get more answers with the 2-stage trial with 2 times as many declared wins and 2.5 times as many declared losses. While such two stage studies have appeal, it is not clear when to define the first stage and what criteria to use to proceed to the second stage. In this paper, we evaluate how choices impact the ability to quickly determine efficacious treatments. We use Brownian Motion to approximate the test statistics over the two stages. We let t 1 < 1 be the time of the stage 1 analysis and \u03b1 1 be the nominal one-sided error rate for graduating from stage 1. One can imagine that each week, a fixed number of patients enroll and we evaluate the distribution of the number of identified efficacious and inefficacious treatments over the course of a year as a function of \u03b1 1 and t 1 .

This makes sense if it is more sensitive to treatment effects than the primary and is thought to be a necessary but insufficient condition for success on the primary endpoint. Examples include early clinical readouts on a composite score portending a benefit in mortality or a good immune response to a vaccine thought necessary to cause a reduction in the incidence of disease. By specifying the power of the intermediate endpoint at trial's end, and the correlation between the two endpoints, we can generalize our approach to this setting. We show that when using the primary endpoint, an optimal stage 1 procedure for actual power of 87.5% is around t 1 = 0.40, \u03b1 1 \u2208(0.28,0.49), with nearly optimal performance for (t 1 , \u03b1 1 ) = (0. 28, 0.49) and (0.54,0.20) . This allows some flexibility in the choice of design. Use of strong surrogates at stage 1 allows an earlier stage 1 decision and substantially improves overall performance. Moderate surrogates should be avoided in favor of the primary endpoint at stage 1. We provide an example using a platform trial that evaluates monoclonal antibodies for COVID-19 disease.",

Thus, after 200 of 1000 planned patients have been evaluated, t = 100/500 = 0.20. For survival trials, t is the proportion of the total number of events that have occurred thus far.

To simplify this problem, we focus on the ratio of wins and actual power. It would be unappealing if the 2-stage method had appreciably less power than a standard trial. Accordingly, we will fix actual power to be close to 90% and then find (t 1 , \u03b1 1 ) that maximizes RW. We will also find a 'good' region where we achieve, say, 90% of the maximum ratio of wins. Figure 3 graphs the RW as a function of the optimal \u03b1 1 over t 1 when we fix actual power at 87.5% and when half of the interventions are truly efficacious. We see that the optimal RW is 1.23, which occurs at (t 1 , \u03b1 1 ) = (0.41, 0.33). The values (t 1 , \u03b1 1 ) = (0.29, 0.49) and (t 1 , \u03b1 1 ) = (0.54, 0.20) achieve 90% of the optimal RW. In practice, other considerations such as availability of other treatments, accrual rate, or other intermediate endpoints might come into play, thus it is reassuring that little is lost in terms of RW when allowing for flexibility in (t 1 , \u03b1 1 ).",

We evaluate performance by defining the ratio of wins (RW) for a 2-stage phase III approach and optimize the timing and 'green light' criteria (t 1 , \u03b1 1 ) to maximize RW while fixing actual power for a given trial. We evaluate use of both the primary endpoint and a surrogate or intermediate endpoint at stage 1.

The major addition of our paper is to evaluate a series of trials within a platform framework rather than a single trial. With this perspective, a new metric, RW, is a natural criterion for evaluation. In some ways, this approach is similar to Simon's optimal design for early stage cancer studies, where a series of likely inefficacious compounds are evaluated in 2-stage one-arm studies (Simon (1989) ). Potentially promising treatments are graduated for further evaluation in a second stage with expanded sample size. Thus, one can view our work as applying Simon's perspective to phase III trials. A key difference is that under Simon's approach, the stage 1 decision is binding, which allows a nominal \u03b1 > 0.05 at the end of stage 2. Likewise, Magirr et al. (2012) and Ghosh et al. (2017) considered binding rules in the context of multi-arm multi-stage designs with the intent of controlling the familywise error rate across stages and arms. We view the stage 1 criteria as non-binding and feel that other information, such as results from other studies or other within-trial endpoints, can and should be allowed to over-ride the stage 1 guidance. Another contribution of our work is allowing a separate intermediate and primary endpoint. Royston et al. (2003) considered MAMS designs with a separate intermediate and definitive endpoint in stages 1 and 2, but did not unify the theory for different types of endpoints using Brownian motion with a modified information fraction.",

Let \u03c1 = cor(X i , Y i ). Consider an interim analysis at the end of stage 1 with m observations per arm. Let m \u2192 \u221e and n \u2192 \u221e in such a way that m/n \u2192 t. Under the null hypothesis that (X, Y ) has the same distribution in the two arms, the joint distribution of the z-score for the surrogate endpoint at the end of stage 1 and the z-score for the primary endpoint at the end of the trial is asymptotically bivariate normal with zero means, unit variances, and correlation \u03c1t 1/2 .Proof. Without loss of generality, we can take E(X) = 0 and E(Y ) = 0 because we can always subtract the common mean of X T and X C , and likewise the common mean of Y T and Y C .Within a given arm, letThe z-scores comparing the two arms for the surrogate endpoint at stage 1 and the primary endpoint at the end of the trial areBy the Cramer-Wold device, it suffices to prove that, for arbitrary constants a and b, aZ Xm +bZ Y n converges in distribution to aZ X + bZ Y . Write aZ Xm + bZ Y n in the following way:whereconverges in probability to 0 because (m/n) 1/2 \u2212t 1/2 and {(n\u2212m)/n} 1/2 \u2212(1\u2212t) 1/2 both converge to 0 and (1/m 1/2 ) m i=1 Y i /\u03c3 Y and {1/(n \u2212 m) 1/2 } n i=m+1 Y i /\u03c3 Y both converge in distribution to standard normals by the CLT. By Slutsky's theorem, we can ignore R n in (3). By the CLT, the first term of (3) converges in distribution to a normal with mean 0 and variance a 2 + b 2 t + 2ab\u03c1 \u221a t, while the second term converges in distribution to a normal with mean 0 and variance b 2 (1 \u2212 t). Moreover, the two terms are independent because they depend on the first m and last n \u2212 m iid observations, respectively. It follows that aZ Xm + bZ Y n converges in distribution to a normal with mean 0 and varianceBut the distribution of aZ X + bZ Y is also normal with mean 0 and variance given by (4). By the Cramer-Wold device, (Z Xm , Z Y n ) is asymptotically normal with zero means, unit variances, and correlation \u03c1t 1/2 , completing the proof.",
