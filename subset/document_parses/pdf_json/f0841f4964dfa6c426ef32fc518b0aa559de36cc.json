(2014) notes that the efficacy of centrality measures, in identifying effective spreaders, differs depending on the system dynamics. Given the clear relationship between random walk and spreading processes it is notable that the efficacy of eigenvector-based spreader selection also varies with the system dynamics; Clark et al. (2019) details the efficacy of eigenvector assessment for consensus dynamics, while De Arruda et al. (2014) notes the inferiority of eigenvector centrality for determining the influence of disease spreaders. In this work we introduce a new network representation of disease spread dynamics, to demonstrate that eigenvector-based assessments can be effective across differing spreading processes as long as the network accurately captures the system dynamics.",

            "text": "Contact networks provide insights on disease spread due to the duration of close proximity interactions. For systems governed by consensus dynamics, network structure is key to optimising the spread of information. For disease spread over contact networks, the structure would be expected to be similarly influential. However, metrics that are essentially agnostic to the network's structure, such as weighted degree (strength) centrality and its variants, perform near-optimally in selecting effective spreaders. These degree-based metrics outperform eigenvector centrality, despite disease spread over a network being a random walk process. This paper improves eigenvector-based spreader selection by introducing the non-linear relationship between contact time and the probability of disease transmission into the assessment of network dynamics. This approximation of disease spread dynamics is achieved by altering the Laplacian matrix, which in turn highlights why nodes with a high degree are such influential disease spreaders. From this approach, a trichotomy emerges on the definition of an effective spreader where, for susceptible-infected simulations, eigenvector-based selections can either optimise the initial rate of infection, the average rate of infection, or produce the fastest time to full infection of the network. Simulated and real-world human contact networks are examined, with insights also drawn on the effective adaptation of ant colony contact networks to reduce pathogen spread and protect the queen ant.",

While, k-shell and s-core [see Eidsaa and Almaas (2013) ] strategies make some acknowledgment of the network structure, these methods are largely agnostic to the communities that may exist even if these are highly separated from each other. In consensus dynamics, Clark et al. (2019) note that the most effective strategies for spreading information often relies on distributing spreaders across multiple communities rather than locating them centrally in the network. Liu and Hu (2005) and Stegehuis et al. (2016) found that community structure does influence the spread of disease on networks. Therefore we aim to highlight that, as with consensus dynamics, a system's eigenvectors capture the interplay of dynamics and network structure that is fundamental to determining the effectiveness of disease spreaders.",

(2019) expanding on the concept of modular centrality to improve the performance of common centrality measures. Degree-based metrics have also been developed that only decentralise the spreader location rather than explicitly acknowledge the network's structure, as in Kitsak et al. (2010) , Zeng and Zhang (2013) , Wang et al. (2016) , Jiang et al. (2019) and Yang et al. (2019) . These include selecting spreaders from less prominent hubs [see Jiang et al. (2019) ], preventing neighbouring spreaders from being selected [see Kitsak et al. (2010) and Wang et al. (2016) ], altering the selected spreader's degree to be negative to avoid selecting nodes with overlapping spheres of influence [see Yang et al. (2019) ], and acknowledging that selecting a spreader should diminish the importance of the links to an already infected node [see Zeng and Zhang (2013) ]. These methods are agnostic to the interplay of topology and network dynamics, which can lead to inaccuracies for certain topologies, as acknowledged by Namtirtha et al. (2020) where a tunable optimisation is developed. In contrast we ensure that every connection informs the spreader selection with the system's eigenvectors providing a holistic assessment of the network, as demonstrated in Clark et al. (2019) and Punzo et al. (2016) for networks with linear consensus dynamics.",

This relationship is often described with an exponential function, as in Kiss et al. (2017) where it is used to simulate disease spread on networks.

The adjacency matrices throughout this paper are symmetric, but it will be important to note that the nonzero row entries of A indicate outgoing links from which a node can contract disease. Whereas the nonzero column entries are incoming links that a node can use to spread disease to its contacts.",

(2019) , are used to provide evidence of the prominent role network structure can play in determining a node's influence as a spreader of disease. This community detection attempts to capture the dynamical influence of nodes, where Klemm et al. (2012) defines dynamical influence as the influence a node has over the dynamic state of other nodes in the network. CDI are defined by global and local dynamical influence, with these communities identified by embedding the network in a Euclidean space defined by the real part of the system's three most dominant eigenvectors. Community leaders are identified as nodes that are further from the origin of this coordinate frame than their neighbours. The nodes belonging to each leader's community must have a directed path connecting them to the leader. If multiple leaders are viable then assignment is based on alignment to a leader, assessed using the scalar projection of each node's position vector in Euclidean space with respect to the viable leaders. In terms of dynamical influence, with respect to the whole network (i.e. global), this approach produces the same results as eigenvector centrality. However, Clark et al. (2019) show that more localised influence can also be identified by incorporating the 2nd and 3rd dominant eigenvectors, with community leaders not necessarily prominent according to eigenvector centrality.",

In this work, the adjacency matrix is altered to reflect the exponential relationship between contact time and risk of disease spread, with the aim of improving the identification of effective spreaders of disease. The first step is to apply a commonly used exponential function for converting contact time into a weight that more accurately represents the increased risk of transmission due to the passage of time, where t is a contact time between two nodes in the network and \u03c4 is the transmission rate, see Kiss et al.

The ratio between incoming edge weights and the magnitude of a node's diagonal entry is greatest for nodes with a high degree. This results in high degree nodes being rewarded with an amplification of their influence, as determined by v 1 , when compared with a linear system. Influence in this context means that a node is effective at spreading the disease to others, while not being easily infected itself by a more influential node.

(2013) to identify three spreaders. Fig. 1 presents a Euclidean space defined by the first two left eigenvectors of the exponentially adjusted Laplacian matrix ( v 1 and v 2 ). In Fig. 1a the most prominent node according to v 1 is the first chosen spreader from the network defined using s = 1 . The communities of dynamical influence (CDI), described in the Communities of dynamical influence section, divides the network into communities with their influence dependent on the largest v 1 entry. Fig. 1b details how removal of this chosen spreader, from the influential nurse-dominated community, results in other nodes in that community losing influence (i.e. a smaller v 1 value) as the number of nodes and pathways for spreading disease in that community has decreased. When a second node from the same community is removed, Fig. 1c details further loss of influence for the nurse community with the chosen spreader now located in a doctor-dominated community. In c, f L e is updated again by removing connections from the chosen spreader in b, e respectively. Markers denote hospital role and dot colour denotes community where community influence is ranked in a according to largest v 1 entry in each community. Node size is mostly proportional to weighted degree, with a minimum size limit used to aid visibility When s = 0.1 the process of spreader selection follows the same pattern, but as can be seen already in Fig. 1d the least influential community from Fig. 1a is given more prominence. In fact, after removing two chosen spreaders, the most prominent node in Fig. 1f is a node from this least influential community (where communities are kept the same as defined for the network in Fig. 1a) . Importantly, and unlike degree based metrics, after selecting a spreader the next spreader is chosen based on a holistic assessment of node influence, i.e. an updated v 1 for the updated network topology after chosen spreader removal. In this way, every spreader selection in this eigenvector-based selection is dependent on and responsive to network structure.",

The choice of \u03c4 = 1 is not intended to be representative of a particular disease, therefore time is reported without units and used only for comparison throughout this section. In Fig. 2a , disease is spread from the most prominent nurse in the nursedominated community, highlighted in Fig. 1a . The smallest mean times to infection are within the nurse community with a couple of the most prominent doctors also Fig. 2 Simulated initial spread of disease from key nodes in a hospital ward contact network. A black outline defines the initially infected node in a, b. The mean time to infection, from 100 SI simulations ( \u03c4 = 1 ), is differentiated by colour for values below 3. Connections between nodes are also displayed receiving early infection. In Fig. 2b the infection is spread from the most prominent doctor, which was selected in Fig. 1b as the chosen spreader. Again the prominent nodes within this doctor's community are amongst the earliest infected, with a selection of the most prominent nurses also being consistently infected within this initial time period. Since the initial disease spread is primarily contained within communities, distributing spreaders across these eigenvector-based communities can be an effective tactic, when looking to rapidly infect a network, as will be demonstrated in the following sections.",

While the eigenvector-based selections appear to perform similarly to the examples in Fig. 3 , the d = 0.2 and d = 0.3 cases (Fig. 3a, b) require an alternative selection of s values. These results are achieved by employing a smaller range for the set S of possible values, namely S = {0.001, 0.01, 0.02, 0.03, 0.04, 0.05, 0.06, 0.07, 0.08, 0.09, 0.1} . The nominal range was defined between 0.001 and 1, but this produces a notably poorer performance in the d = 0.2 and 0.3 cases for the Initial and Averaged selections. P-NNR topologies can produce strongly connected hubs, with the requirement for smaller s values likely necessary to reduce the influence of the most prominent community after the first chosen spreader's removal and therefore enabling the selection of spreaders from less influential communities.",

(2018) exposed a number of ants to a pathogen, monitored all ant contacts for a period of 9 days and recorded which ants died during that period. The separation of the queen ant from the pathogen carriers is noted by Stroeymeyt et al. (2018) , and can also be seen clearly by looking at Fig. 5 where the network is embedded in a Euclidean space defined by the system eigenvectors with the communities of dynamical influence (CDI), described in the Communities of dynamical influence section, also detailed. Six of the eleven monitored colonies are presented in the figure. From these it can be seen that infected ants can still maintain relatively long durations of contact, as denoted by the size of each node's marker that is proportional to weighted degree. There are examples of infected ants with minimal contacts during the experiment, but a more consistent sign of colony adaptation to the presence of pathogen is seen in the network structure. The communities are defined by CDI using the first three eigenvectors of the adjacency matrix, with Fig. 5 presenting two of these three dimensions. In Fig. 5 , the queen's community is either free from pathogen carriers or pathogen carriers are at the origin of the eigenvector defined Euclidean space, which indicates that they have very limited contact with other ants. In many of the examples, no ants in the queen's community die during this survival experiment, indicating that they are unlikely to have Fig. 4 Results from SI simulations ( \u03c4 = 1 ) of artificial contact networks using four selected spreaders. The median times from 100 artificially generated proximity networks are reported, where each median was assessed from 100 SI simulations. The proximity networks (P-NNR) are defined by the Euclidean distance threshold (d). In a d = 0.2, a d = 0.3, a d = 0.4, and a d = 0.5 where connection weights are given a value between 0 and 1 according to a uniform random distribution. Times are recorded when 25%, 50%, 75% and 100% of network are infected then normalised using division by the mean of all times recorded at each percentage. From left to right; times are detailed for the weighted degree (no neighbours) selection, then the optimised selections for initial rate (Initial), average performance (Averaged), and time to all infected (End). The y-axes of a, b are cropped to exclude extreme values contracted significant quantities of the pathogen. Furthermore, the relative influence of communities are indicated in Fig. 5 , based on the largest first eigenvector entry of the adjacency matrix (eigenvector centrality) from each community. Pathogen carrying ants are commonly located in the least influential communities, as seen for 8 out of the 11 colonies investigated, where they have less ability to infect the rest of the network. Whereas pathogen carriers were only present in the most influential community in 2 out of the 11 colonies. In both of these cases, the pathogen carriers were closer to the origin of the Euclidean frame than the majority of their community's members, indicating their lack of influence in this most influential community. All 11 ant colonies are presented in the Additional file 1, including both the v A1 and v A2 (Fig.  S4) and v A2 and v A3 (Fig. S5) perspectives.",

This paper has demonstrated that there is an issue with analysing the contact network composed of contact durations, when what is of primary concern is the probability of disease transmission. We have attempted to provide a better representation of a disease transmission network, by introducing the exponentially adjusted Laplacian. In doing so, we have highlighted why weighted degree selections perform well in the specific application of disease spread; this is not a new observation as De Arruda et al.

            "text": "Network structure influences the location of the most effective spreaders of disease; evidenced by ant colony networks and the effectiveness of eigenvector-based identification of effective spreaders, on both simulated and real-world contact networks. The system eigenvectors capture the influence of disease spreaders, when the network dynamics are accurately represented. We show that disease spread dynamics can be approximated by adjusting the construction of the Laplacian matrix to capture the non-linear relationship between contact time and the probability of disease spread. By representing the dynamics in this way, the success of degree based metrics-in identifying effective spreaders of disease-is shown to be due, in part, to the non-linear dynamics rewarding high degree nodes with greater influence. The concept of an effective spreader is shown to be illdefined, where-for the newly introduced exponentially adjusted Laplacian-altering the ratio of incoming connection weight versus the magnitude of the diagonal entry creates a trichotomy on the concept of effective spreading. A spreader selection can be identified that can outperform the benchmark metric of weighted degree (applying a no neighbour constraint) in terms of the initial rate of infection, the average rate of infection, or the time to full infection of the network.",
