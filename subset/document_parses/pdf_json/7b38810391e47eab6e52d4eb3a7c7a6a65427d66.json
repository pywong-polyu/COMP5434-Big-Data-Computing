The goal of the literature mining was to identify host genes and entities that are relevant to coronavirus research and to establish connections between them. An entity can refer to a word or phrase of the concept name including related concepts (e.g., virus structure and chemical composition, source of infection, and virus type). The gene names were defined using the mammalian official gene symbols in the Hugo Gene Naming Committee (HGNC) database. We directly retrieved 667 candidate genes from the local samples. By establishing a random distribution of one of the candidate genes in a control sample, the significance of this gene appearing in the local samples can be determined if the frequency of the current gene is an outlier of the random distribution of a control sample (see Methods for details). By calculating the odds ratio, we can also further determine the specificity of the association between this gene and the local samples.

TWIRLS first calculates the specific co-distribution between CSHGs in local samples, then determines the distance between each pair of CSSEs and performs dichotomy clustering according to the linkage relationship between CSSEs and CSHGs. This step classified the 623 entities into 32 categories represented as C0-C31 (see category number in Table S1 , Sheet 1 second column).

Deficiency of ACE2 causes respiratory failure pathologies such as sepsis, pneumonia, and SARS (Boehm & Nabel, 2002; Imai et al., 2005) . It has been confirmed that genetic deletion of AT1a receptor expression in mice can significantly improve lung function and reduce the formation of pulmonary edema compared with wild-type mice (Sugaya et al., 1995) .

This suggests that AT1R mediates the pathogenicity of Ang II, whereas activated AT2R has a protective role (Hein, Barsh, Pratt, Dzau, & Kobilka, 1995 Although Ang II was originally described as an effective vasoconstrictor, there is growing evidence that it is closely involved in the inflammatory response of the immune system.

The result showed that the topic entity categories are divided into three groups based on the essence of the entity category labels: molecular biology research of SARS virus, research of different coronavirus genera and pathogenic mechanism of coronavirus. Further analysis of the time distribution information showed that the relevant literatures of the entity category in the molecular biology research group of SARS virus were mainly published after 2003, which is in line with the time point of SARS outbreak.

The binding of the virus to ACE2 may disrupt this balance, which causes a homeostatic imbalance in RAS, leading to subsequent pathological changes.", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF5": {"text": "). On the other hand, RAS has also been implicated in mediating the cytokine storm and has functional relationships with the immune system.Angiotensin II regulates vascular tension and stimulates the release of proinflammatory cytokines(El Bekay et al., 2003;Ruiz-Ortega et al., 2002). The production and release of CXC chemokines can induce the accumulation of neutrophils in vivo(Ide, Hirase, Nishimoto-Hazuku, Ikeda, & Node, 2008). Besides, ACE inhibitors and Ang II receptor blockers have been used in a number of cytokinemediated inflammatory pathologies, and AT1R blockers (angiotensin receptor blocker) were shown to have beneficial effects that are commonly attributed to AT2R activation(Henrion, 2012). It was also reported that Ang II-stimulated human endothelial cells exhibit increased release of a CXC chemokine, IFN-\u03b3-inducible protein 10 (IP-10 or CXCL10). This protein is mainly expressed in the lung and is a chemoattractant for activated T cells. The expression of IP-10 has been observed in many Th1-type inflammatory diseases, where it is thought to play an important role in recruiting activated T cells to sites T A B L E 5 The z score values of clinical characteristics", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF6": {"text": "TABLE 1 Coronavirus-entity category labels and genes associated", "latex": null, "type": "table", "html": "<html><body><table><tr><td>Category </td><td>with each category.
