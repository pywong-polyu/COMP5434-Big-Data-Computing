This indicates that differences in cell composition in tissues that consist of multiple cell types, such as tonsil, can have a large impact on observed differences in gene expression. Based on both the NanoString and the RNA-seq data, KS06infected pigs showed greater activation, or less inhibition, of immune response in tonsils at 42 dpi than NVSLinfected pigs, with and without accounting for CE. This suggests that the NVSL virus may be better than the KS06 virus at evading host immune response and persists in tonsils by weakening, or preventing, host immune responses. Pigs with high viral levels showed larger CE of immune cells than low viral level pigs, potentially to trigger stronger immune responses. Presence of high tonsil virus was associated with a stronger immune response, especially innate immune response through interferon signaling, but these differences were not significant when accounting for CE. Genotype at WUR was associated with different effects on immune response in tonsils of pigs during the persistence stage, depending on viral isolate and tonsil viral level.",

            "text": "Porcine respiratory and reproductive syndrome (PRRS) is the most economically significant disease in modern pig production worldwide and has been estimated to cost $664 million annually in combined production losses in breeding and growing-pig herds in the United States [1] and about $793,000 per average European farm that was severely affected in breeding, nursery, and fattening stages [2] . The PRRS disease is caused by the PRRS virus (PRRS V), which is a positive single-strand, enveloped RNA virus that belongs to the order Nidovirales, family Arteriviridae [3] . PRRSV can modulate host immune response by inhibiting natural killer cell cytotoxic activity [4] and IFN\u03b1 production [5] and by stimulating the negative regulator interleukin-4 [6] , which can result in a weak and slow immune response and poor control of virus replication. This weak antiviral immune response can lead to a persistent infection in a subset of pigs, which can cause a second outbreak when the virus is transmitted to na\u00efve pigs through oral-nasal secretions and semen [7] . In asymptomatic carrier pigs, PRRSV can persist in lymphoid tissues for 251 days, including tonsils and lymph nodes [8, 9] . In addition, clinical signs of PRRS vary greatly between pigs and between PRRSV strains, which is primarily due to the genetic diversity within the structural and nonstructural proteins of the virus that may result from mutations during viral replication in the host, all of which contribute to the difficulty to control PRRSV with vaccines [10] . Thus, more knowledge is needed about the mechanisms of host resistance and viral persistence during PRRSV infection in pigs.",

            "text": "The PRRS Host Genetics Consortium (PHGC) was established in 2007, with the aim to investigate the genetic basis of host response to PRRSV infection in nursery pigs [11] . Results showed that host response to PRRSV is moderately heritable but highly polygenic [12] , beyond the effects of a putatively causative intronic SNP, rs340943904, in the guanylate binding protein 5 gene (GBP5), which results in an early stop codon and a putatively non-functional GBP5 protein [13] . This SNP was found to be in complete linkage disequilibrium with SNP rs80800372 (WUR) on Sus scrofa chromosome 4 [13] . The effect of the WUR SNP on viral load (VL) and weight gain (WG) after PRRSV infection was confirmed for two genetically distinct North American PRRSV isolates, NVSL-97-7895 (NVSL) and KS-2006-72109 (KS06), for vaccination with a PRRS modified live vaccine (MLV), for co-infection with PRRSV and PCV2b [14] [15] [16] , and for infection with an attenuated European PRRSV strain (effect on growth rate only) [17] . Results from the same PHGC trials as used in the present study have shown that the NVSL strain is more virulent and less persistent in serum than the KS06 strain, and that pigs with the AB or BB genotype at the WUR SNP have significantly lower serum viremia than AA pigs following infection with either PRRSV isolate [16] . The effect of WUR genotype on PRRSV persistence, however, differed depending on virulence of the PRRSV isolate [16] . Moreover, anti-viral immune responses of pigs differed substantially between PRRSV isolates [18, 19] . Therefore, it is important to understand the mechanisms of host response following infection with different PRRSV isolates to help develop intervention strategies, to improve antiviral responses, and to clear PRRSV infection.",

Guo et al. [20] found that a higher level of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) of the PRRSV in the germinal center of lymph nodes, a mediator for viral persistence, did not stimulate antiviral immunity. In addition, using data from five PHGC trials, including the two trials used here, Hess et al. [21] reported that low tonsil viral level at 42 days post infection (dpi) was phenotypically associated with an earlier and faster rate of maximal viral clearance from blood, with lower viral load in serum from 0 to 42 dpi, and with lower serum viremia at 42 dpi. Abella et al. [17] suggested that pigs that were non-viremic between 4 and 42 days post vaccination did not become a reservoir for an attenuated European PRRSV strain in tonsils. Furthermore, Lunney et al. [22] showed that variation in the levels of three serum cytokines (IL-8, IL-1\u03b2, and IFN-\u03b3 was significantly correlated with serum virus levels from 1 to 21 dpi, accounting for 84% of the variation in virus levels in lymphoid tissues between pigs, including inguinal lymph nodes, submaxillary lymph nodes, and tonsils. To better understand mechanisms of PRRSV persistence in lymphoid tissues, especially in tonsils, we need to know more about the genes associated with host response to PRRSV in tonsils.",

For example, tonsils contained a higher percentage of B cells than blood and some other lymphoid tissues [23] , and the percentages of antiviral antibody secreting B cells in tonsils increased significantly from 3 to 60 days after PRRSV infection [24] . Kawashima et al. [25] also observed differences in the numbers of CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, and B cells in tonsils from 0 to 10 dpi after PRRSV inoculation of 53 to 55 day-old pigs. Generally, the number of B cells in tonsils increases and the numbers of CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells decreases until 10 days after PRRSV infection [25] . This emphasizes the importance of considering cell composition of tonsils during PRRSV infection.",

Pigs with a high virus level in tonsil (High-TVclass) had significantly larger CE scores for immune cells per unit of library size of the tonsil RNA-seq data than pigs with a low virus level in tonsil (Low-TVclass) (p = 0.034) ( Table 1 ). In addition, although not significant (p = 0.27 and 0.46, respectively), tonsils from KS06-infected pigs and from AB genotype pigs had numerically larger CE scores for immune cells than tonsils from NVSLinfected and AA genotype pigs, respectively. For After analyzing the 64 cell types in xCell for the effects of Isolate, TVclass, WUR, age, sex, RIN, and two-way interactions among Isolate, TVclass, and WUR, the CE scores of 28 cell types were found to be significantly affected (p < 0.05) by at least one of these factors and were put in the significant (Sig) group of cell types (Table S1 ), while the remaining 34 cell types were allocated to the nuisance (Nui) group. In the Sig group, 14 of 28 cell types were immune cells, compared to 20 of 34 cell types in the Nui group. Based on the CE scores in the tonsil samples, cell type enrichments were significantly different between the two isolates and between the high and low TVclass samples for four and 12 cell types, respectively (Table 1) . Principle component analysis (PCA) plots of the CE estimates across the 51 samples suggested that Isolate and TVclass did not account for large proportions of the variation in the 28 cell types in the Sig group ( Figure S2 ). For the Sig group, the first three principal components (SigPC1, SigPC2, and SigPC3) explained 31.0, 22.0, and 18.4%, respectively, of the variance, while the first three principal components of the Nui group (NuiPC1, NuiPC2, and NuiPC3) explained 55.3, 17.9, and 8.0% of the variance, respectively. The top three cell types explained by each PC are shown in Table S2 . (Table 2 ). Differences in cell composition had significant effects on the tonsil transcriptome at 42 dpi based on changes in the numbers of DEGs for Isolate, TVclass, and their interaction, when CE was included in the model, and based on identification of a large number of DEGs for the effect of the fitted PC's for CE (Table 2 and Table S3 ). The number of DEGs identified for Isolate was lower when CE was accounted for. TVclass revealed four DEGs when CE was accounted for and zero without CE. For the main effect of WUR, two DEGs were identified in the model with CE and zero DEG without CE. Significant effects of the two-way interactions of WUR with Isolate and TVclass on gene expression were only identified when CE was accounted for. For the effect of sex, the same 24 genes were identified to be DEGs in models without and with CE (Table S3) , while correlations of log 2 (Fold Change) (log 2 FC) and q values of these 24 DEGs in the models without and with were 1.00 and 0.94, respectively. Thus, the effect of sex on the tonsil transcriptome did not change substantially when accounting for CE but accounting for CE did impact the effect of other factors.",

Within a trial, all pigs were, however, euthanized and necropsied on the same day. We did try to select tonsil RNA samples with higher RIN scores but many had RIN scores less than 5.0.",

Tonsils are aggregates of lymph nodules and diffuse lymphoid tissues [28] , which makes it difficult to remove them completely for weighing. Instead, our gene expression data were based upon a standard sample size. Differences in tonsil size can, however, result from Comparison of the immune response related pathways that include differentially expressed genes for pigs infected with the KS06 versus the NVSL PRRSV isolate (K/N) based on the model without cell enrichments. The expression values of genes with a false discovery rate < 0.1 were used to calculate -log(p-values) and z-scores for each pathway. Orange color (z-score \u2265 2) and blue color (z-score \u2264 \u2212 2) indicate activation and inhibition of predicted pathways, respectively. The more intense these colors, the higher the absolute z-scores differences in gene expression levels between treatments or factors that may play roles in cell movement, inflammation, immune cell proliferation, or apoptosis. This is consistent with our results of the biological functions of the DEGs, such as \"cell movement\", \"cellular infiltration by eosinophils\", \"monocytopoiesis\", \"formation of granuloma\", \"accumulation of myeloid cells\", \"chemotaxis of granulocytes\", \"influx of blood cells\", and \"organismal death\". For TVclass, cause and effect relationships between tonsil viral level and gene expression in tonsils could not be determined. Unlike Isolate or WUR genotype, TVclass was not conducted or pre-selected or assigned before 42 dpi but was classified based on the tonsil viral level at 42 dpi. Therefore, for TVclass, we have two hypotheses: (1) tonsil virus level is the result of differences in immune response, or (2) immune response is the result of the level of tonsil viral load. Because our results showed that pigs with High-TVclass were enriched for immune cells, a high level of virus in tonsil may be the cause of the host's anti-viral immune response.",

This indicates that absence of serum viremia does not imply clearance of the virus from the body and that the virus can persist much longer in tonsil. This is consistent with previous findings that viral dsRNA persisted in multiple lymphoid tissues [20] , although no virus was detected in serum of PRRSV-infected pigs at 52 dpi, thereby escaping antiviral immune response. Therefore, we expected to see prolonged effects of infection on gene expression in tonsil. We found that the 180 NVSL-infected pigs had significantly higher tonsil viral levels (p = 0.02) and lower serum viremia (p = 0.01) than the 157 KS06-infected pigs, although this difference was not significant for the 53 samples selected for RNA-seq (results not shown). However, Hess et al. [21] , using data from the same two trials as used here, along with three additional PHGC trials from other genetic sources, found the difference of tonsil viral levels between NVSL-(n = 480) and KS06-(n = 302) infected pigs not to be significant. This suggests that the effect of PRRSV isolate on tonsil viral levels at 42 dpi may differ between sources of genetics. For the five trials analyzed by Hess et al. [16] , they found that KS06 was more persistent in serum than NVSL, as more KS06-infected pigs had log 10 serum viremia greater than one at 42 dpi, which is consistent with results from our study on a subset of these data. This indicates that the NVSL strain may be better at avoiding detection and persisting in tonsils by weakening immune responses in tonsils than the KS06 strain. Although we identified a positive relationship between tonsil viral level and serum viremia at 42 dpi, similar to Hess et al. [21] , serum viremia was not a good predictor of tonsil viral level at 42 dpi and is, therefore, of limited use in predicting PRRSV persistence.",

Because we did not directly measure cell composition of the tonsil samples, we used the xCell software [27] to estimate CE for each sample based on the tonsil transcriptome data.

Based on this, the number of independent tests conducted was estimated to be 6 + 5 = 11, which, when used for Bonferroni correction, results in an adjusted threshold for significance of 0.1/11 = 0.009. Based on the xCell results (Table  1) , only three cell types had significantly larger enrichment scores in the High-TVclass pigs than in the Low-TVclass pigs (q < 0.009): class-switched memory B cells, CD8+ central memory T cells, and basophils. This indicates that pigs with high tonsil viral levels may recruit more immune cells, especially B cells and T cells, to help clear persistent virus from the tonsil. Basophils are involved in anti-parasite immunity and allergic responses. Basophils may also have some unknown function to enhance anti-viral immunity. Although none of the other cell types had significant effects (Table 1) , there was a trend towards higher CE scores for specific immune cells for KS06-compared to NVSL-infected pigs and for pigs with the AA versus the AB genotype at WUR. This suggests that the KS06 strain may stimulate a stronger immune response in tonsil at 42 dpi than the NVSL strain, and that AB pigs may not need to recruit as many immune cells in tonsils at 42 dpi to clear the virus as AA pigs.",

The 12 DEGs that overlapped between the NanoString and RNA-seq results displayed the same trend of fold change ( Table 6 ). Nine of 17 immune response related pathways of the Isolate -CE-DEGs were predicted to be more activated, or less inhibited, in the KS06-compared to the NVSL-infected pigs, based on both types of data (Fig. 4) , showing the consistency of these two platforms. However, the correlation of the normalized read counts obtained based on the NanoString and RNA-seq data for the 203 common genes was low, averaging 0.19 and ranging from \u2212 0.52 to + 0.70. These low correlations may be the result of the relatively low RIN scores of the RNA samples, potentially due to RNA degradation during and after sample collection. In RNA-seq, sequencing reads are generated from whole transcripts and, as a result, the RIN score may have an effect on the quality of reads, which was confirmed by the significant effect of RIN on the observed read counts of genes based on the RNAseq data. To account for the effects of RNA quality in the RNA-seq analyses, we used two weights in the statistical analyses: one that accounts for heterogeneity of sample level variance, which can be due to RNA quality, and an observation level weight that considers the mean-variance relationship of read counts for each gene [29] . Unlike RNA-seq, NanoString just requires~150 bp sequence from each transcript and requires no conversion of RNA to cDNA but identifies the RNA molecules directly. This is expected to make NanoString less sensitive to RNA quality. In contrast to RNA-seq, NanoString also does not encounter the issue of multiple-mapping reads in the alignment process because a molecular barcode is designed specifically for each gene. This also makes NanoString better able to detect low-abundance transcripts than RNA-seq, which depends on read depth to obtain reliable detection [30] . Therefore, we can put more confidence in the NanoString results than in the RNA-seq results for the 203 common genes.",

However, none of these 20 pathways were significant when accounting for CE. This indicates that the expression differences that were identified for immunerelated genes between the two PRRSV isolates in the model without CE were due to differences in cell composition of tonsil between the two isolates. This is consistent with what we found for the effect of isolate on CE, which showed that tonsils from the KS06-infected pigs were predicted to have more immune cells, triggering stronger immune responses, compared to tonsils from NVSL-infected pigs. This suggests that the NVSL strain may inhibit or evade host immune response and persist in tonsils more effectively than the KS06 strain. This is consistent with Guo et al. [20] , who found that down-regulation of genes involved in B cell and T cell receptor signaling pathways, including ICOS and CD40L expression, results in inhibition of clearance of persistently infected cells, which allows viruses to be maintained in the lymph nodes of persistently infected pigs [20] .",

GP6, a membrane glycoprotein that is expressed in platelets and their precursor megakaryocytes, can stimulate platelet activation and thrombus formation. Platelets play an important role, not only in hemostasis and thrombosis, but also in immunity and inflammation. Many immune related receptors and ligands are present on platelets, including all nine Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and scavenger receptors. Platelets may sample the blood environment to help present the virus to other immune cells [31] . Platelet activation induces the acute phase response to infection and produces IL-1\u03b2 in mice [32] . In addition, platelets can interact with monocytes and leukocytes via platelet P-selectin [33] . Therefore, our results suggest that KS06 may induce a stronger immune response in tonsils through platelet activation than NVSL, regardless of cell composition.",

Of the 27 Isolate +CE-DEGs in this novel network, 24 were expressed more in the tonsils of KS06-than of NVSLinfected pigs. These genes were predicted to interact with NF-k\u0392, HISTONE, and RNA polymerase II, suggesting that KS06 may cause a stronger immune response by promoting transcription of genes to produce important immune proteins, such as antibodies or cytokines. This is consistent with the IPA regulator prediction that the Isolate +CE-DEGs that were expressed more in the tonsils of KS06-infected pigs, activate cell movement and have less growth failure and organismal death ( Fig. 2a and b) . This suggests that KS06 infection may induce more immune cell movement to clear the virus from tonsils or to relieve the resulting cell damage.",

When accounting for CE, the NanoString results identified stronger innate immune responses in High-TVclass than in Low-TVclass pigs, with more IFNG in blood and activation of granuloma formation (Fig. 3b) . Based on the RNA-seq data, when accounting for CE, the DEG for TVclass that were not evaluated using NanoString, also had functions to induce stronger immunity in High-TVclass pigs. For example, the TSPAN10 gene had significantly higher expression in High-TVclass than in Low-TVclass pigs. The TSPAN10 gene has been implicated in Notch activation by promoting ADAM10, which plays an essential role as a \"molecular scissor\" in ligand-dependent cleavage of the Notch protein and in control of cell fate decisions [34] . Conditional knockouts of ADAM10 in mice revealed impaired B-, T-, and myeloid cell development and/or function [35] [36] [37] . This suggests that High-TVclass pigs may induce a stronger immune response than Low-TVclass pigs related to B, T, and myeloid cell development and/or function through the Notch signaling pathway in tonsils. Therefore, TSPAN10 is a potential candidate gene to target for control of PRRSV persistence.",

Both FOS and FOSB are members of the FOS gene family and are activator protein-1 (AP-1) transcription factor subunits. FOS proteins play a role in regulating cell proliferation, differentiation, and transformation. A previous study showed that the FOSB gene was up-regulated in alveolar macrophages during the early phase of infection with a European PRRSV strain [38] . However, based on the RNA-seq data from this study, when accounting for CE, the FOSB gene was expressed more in tonsils of Low-TVclass than of High-TVclass pigs.

Although the low expression level of GBP5 gene makes it difficult to detect, especially with RNA-seq, it did have significantly higher expression in tonsils of AB than of AA pigs based on the NanoString data in the model with CE. Although not significant, the same directional trend was found for GBP5 gene based on the RNA-seq data in the model with and without CE (q = 0.45 and 0.94) and in the model without CE based on the NanoString data (q = 0.22). These trends are consistent with results by Koltes et al. [13] for expression in blood following PRRSV infection without accounting for CE. In human studies, Huttlin et al. [39] found that the GBP5 protein interacts with several other proteins in HEK293T cells, including EPHA4, GBP1, and SURF1, as well as with other genes that are currently not in the pig Ensembl database. We found that both GBP5 and EPHA4 gene were expressed more in AB than in AA pigs in the model with CE. However, in our RNA-seq data, expression of SURF1 was not detected in tonsils and GBP1 was not significantly associated with WUR genotype for either model. The EPHA4, GBP1, and SURF1 genes were not included on the NanoString panel. In mouse, Rothgiesser et al. [40] found that both GBP5 and EPHA4 were NF-\u03baB-dependent genes.

Among the NVSL-infected pigs, S100A8 was not a DEG for WUR based on either the RNA-seq or the NanoString data. Based on the Nano-String data, the IL-8 signaling pathway was more activated, or less inhibited, in AB than in AA pigs, when infected with KS06. IL-8 is also known as CXCL8, belongs to the CXC chemokine family, and can bind to CXCR1 and CXCR2 as cell-surface receptors and stimulate exocytosis, chemotaxis, and signal transduction, depending on the cell type [41] . Thus, our results suggest that, when infected with KS06, AB pigs activated a stronger innate immune response in tonsils at 42 dpi than AA pigs. Of the 107 identified Isolate*WUR + CE-DEGs based on the RNA-seq data, 74 (69%) had significantly higher expression in AB than in AA pigs when infected with KS06 but there was no significant difference between AB and AA pigs for these genes when infected with NVSL. This suggests that, at the transcriptome level, WUR genotype, which has an effect on GBP5 gene expression [13] , had a larger effect in the tonsils of KS06-compared to NVSL-infected pigs. Four of the Isolate*WUR + CE-DEGs are serine proteases (KLK10, KLK12, TMPRSS11D, and TMPRSS11E based on the RNA-seq data), which play essential roles in inflammatory responses and in innate and adaptive immunity [42] . These genes were expressed more in the tonsils of AB than of AA pigs when infected with KS06 and accounting for CE, but they were not DEGs for WUR in NVLS-infected pigs, which was consistent with the NanoString results. In summary, the AB genotype at WUR was associated with stronger immune response in tonsils at 42 dpi, especially innate immune response, for pigs infected with KS06 but not for pigs infected with NVSL.",

Based on the tonsil RNA-seq data, LOXL4 was the only significant DEG for WUR within the Low-TVclass. The LOXL4 protein contains a highly conserved protein module, Scavenger Receptor Cysteine-Rich domain, which plays roles in innate immune response [43] . The LOXL4 gene can be stimulated by TGF-\u03b21 through the Smad and AP-1 complex, which is composed of JunB/Fra2 and plays a role in vascular extracellular matrix homeostasis [44] . This suggests that the greater expression of LOXL4 in AB versus AA pigs among the Low-TVclass pigs may result in stronger innate immune response in AB than in AA pigs, but with no effect among High-TVclass pigs.

The impact of PRRSV isolates on host immune responses provides insights into the potential means of viral persistence in tonsils. In summary, we found higher immune responses in tonsils of KS06-infected pigs and in pigs with high levels of virus in tonsil, than in tonsils of NVSL-infected pigs and in pigs with low levels of virus in tonsil at 42 dpi. Based on these results, we hypothesize that NVSL can persist in tonsils longer than KS06. Moreover, the presence of more virus in tonsils (high tonsil viral level) induces stronger immune responses, especially innate immune responses. Genes that were significantly impacted by the interaction of WUR genotype with isolate may play a critical role in innate immune response, especially the IL-8 signaling pathway, which indicates that the GBP5 gene may have different effects on tonsil immune responses during persistence in pigs infected by different PRRSV strains.",

Accounting for cell composition allowed us to more comprehensively understand the mechanisms of PRRSV persistence. Although we used the xCell software, which is designed based on human data, to predict CE scores in porcine tonsils, our data affirmed the importance of cell migration during persistence. Integration of information on novel genes from the Iso-Seq data provided important information on differential expression of these genes in tonsils, which can be potential candidate genes to help control PRRSV persistence. Future studies should examine protein expression levels and validate the estimated cell composition in tonsils. Use of single cell sequencing and gene knockouts would help confirm mechanisms of PRRSV persistence and identify candidate genes to target to decrease PRRSV persistence.",

A total of 27 pigs that died or that were euthanized for humane reasons before 42 dpi were not included. At 42 dpi, all remaining pigs were euthanized, and serum and tonsil samples were collected (to the greatest extent possible, the central portion of the tonsil, at the oral side of the soft palate, was sampled through its entire depth). Animals were humanely euthanized by pentobarbital overdose following the American Veterinary Medical Association guidelines for the euthanasia of animals, and all efforts were made to minimize suffering. Tonsil samples were frozen and stored at -80\u00b0C until analyzed. Tonsil viral level and serum viremia were evaluated by a semiquantitative PCR assay for PRRSV RNA, as described in Boddicker et al. [14] and Hess et al. [21] . Two assays, the Applied Biosystems AgPath ID NA and EU PRRSV reagents (AB assay), and the Tetracore US and EURO PRRSV Master Mix reagents (Tetracore assay), were used to measure the tonsil viral levels for the NVSL and KS06 trails, respectively, because the cDNA from the KS06 isolate failed to be amplified by the AB primers [21] . Therefore, the tonsil virus levels for NVSL were adjusted to their Tetracore equivalent, as described in Hess et al. [21] . VLTotal in serum was calculated by area under the Wood's curve from infection until euthanasia at 42 dpi, as a measure that includes both the level of viremia and the extent to which viremia is maintained [16, 50] . Additional details of these trials and assays are presented in Hess et al. [21] .",

            "text": "Total RNA was isolated from aliquots of frozen tonsil samples using RNeasy RNA isolation kit (Qiagen, Germantown, MD, USA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. RNA concentration was first measured with a NanoDrop ND-1000 UV-vis Spectrophotometer (Nano-Drop Technologies Inc., Wilmington, DE, USA). The RIN score of the extracted RNA was determined for each sample using the RNA Nano 6000 Assay kit on an Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 system (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). A total of 53 tonsil samples were selected for gene expression analyses based on high or low PRRSV level in the tonsil (at least one standard deviation from the mean) (High and Low-TVclass) and RIN score of the extracted RNA ( Figure S1 ). Figure 1 illustrates the samples that were selected for RNA-seq; for PHGC5, n = 15 NVSL_High, with tonsil viral level at 42 dpi (TV42) = 6.81 \u00b1 0.56 log 10 (viral copies/mg)), n = 15 NVSL_Low with TV42 = 3.65 \u00b1 0.42 log 10 (viral copies/ mg); for PHGC14, n = 12 KS06_High with TV42 = 4.63 \u00b1 0.28 log 10 (viral copies/mg), and n = 11 KS06_Low with TV42 = 2.11 \u00b1 0.37 log 10 (viral copies/mg)). The average age of the pigs for the 53 selected samples was 26.5 \u00b1 0.8 days and their gender information is shown in Figure S3 . NanoString analyses were performed on these same samples. All pigs were genotyped for the WUR SNP (rs80800372), as part of the 60 K panel for which all PHGC pigs were genotyped (13 AB and 38 AA pigs for RNA-seq, Figure S3 ). Raw reads from the fastq files obtained from each of the five lanes were checked for quality using FastQC (Version 0.11.3) [51] , trimmed using Trimmomatic (Version 0.36) [52] , and aligned to build 11.1 of the pig genome using STAR (Version 2.5.3) [53] . To avoid multiple mapping issues for the hemoglobin (HB) genes, HBB-like (ENSSSCG00000014727) and one of two similar exon sequences within HBA (ENSSSCG00000007978) were masked in the reference genome sequence. For gene annotation, Ensembl pig 11.1 gene annotation was used, combined with annotation for an additional 12,491 novel genes that were identified by Pacific Biosciences Iso-Seq of a cross-bred pig and RNA-seq data of nine pig tissues (brain, hypothalamus, liver, muscle, thymus, pituitary, small intestine, spleen, and diaphragm) [26] . The current version of Ensembl gene annotation (SSC11.1) does not include GBP5. Instead, the WUR SNP (rs80800372) and the putative causative GBP5 intronic SNP (rs340943904) are located in three of nine transcripts that are incorrectly annotated as GBP1: ENSSSCT00000065307, ENSS SCT00000060466, and ENSSSCT00000044130 [13] . Thus, the gene annotation file was changed to recognize these three transcripts as GBP5. BAM output files from STAR were used to build an index using Samtools (Version 1.3.1.1) [54] and used as inputs for counting reads using htseq-count [55] with the merged Ensembl gene annotation and IsoSeq novel gene annotation as a gtf file. The resulting read count data for each of the five lanes were then combined into one dataset for each tonsil sample. Two samples in the NVSL-low group with low read counts and high proportions of zero read counts (89.1 and 91.2%) were excluded from further analysis, leaving 51 samples.",

The software xCell [27] was used to estimate the CE of each sample for 64 immune and stromal cell types (Table S1 ) based on the gene expression levels of signature genes for each cell type. All 51 samples were analyzed simultaneously, using the tonsil RNA-seq data for 6993 genes for which Sus scrofa gene names from Ensembl overlapped with the xCell gene list, which includes 10,782 genes with human gene names. The output data, used for subsequent analyses, were the CE scores after transformation of raw cell composition scores to percentages and adjustment using the spill over compensation matrix from xCell [35] . We analyzed the resulting CE scores for each cell type using a linear model with the fixed effects of Isolate, TVclass, WUR, sex, RIN (covariate), age (covariate), and the 2-way and 3-way interactions among Isolate, TVclass, and WUR. The best model for each cell type was selected based on the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) through backward selection using the stepAIC function in R. ANOVA was used to test significance of the effects of the factors or covariates in the best model for each cell type. Based on this, cell types were assigned to a \"significant cell type\" group (Sig) if at least one of the factors of Isolate, TVclass, WUR, their interactions, sex, or age, was significant (p < 0.1) for that cell type; otherwise, it was assigned to the \"nuisance cell type\" group (Nui). The rationale for this was that effects of cell types in the Sig group were more important to account for in the differentially expression (DE) analysis than the effects of cell types in the Nui group because the former are expected to impact the estimates of effects of factors of interest on DE analysis. However, because cell types in the Nui group may explain part of the random variation in the gene expression data, they are also be important to consider in DE analysis. Considering the limitation of our sample size (n = 51), PCA was used for each group of cell types for dimensionality reduction for CE scores for inclusion in the DE analysis.",

            "text": "The R language (version 3.3.1) was used for all statistical analyses. After removing transcripts with mean read counts across all 51 samples less than eight and less than four samples with read counts larger than zero, 19,107 genes were determined to be expressed in tonsil at 42 dpi. Of these, 12,243 were annotated in Ensembl pig 11.1, while the rest were novel genes identified by Iso-Seq [26] . This included the GBP5 gene, which was annotated as being part of the GBP1 gene in Ensembl pig 11.1. Differential expression analyses were performed using the linear model pipeline implemented in the voomWith-QualityWeights function of the R limma package [29, 58] . Briefly, read counts were first log-transformed as log 2 [(n + 0.5)*10 6 /(m + 1)], where n is the read count of a given gene in a sample and m is the upper quartile of read counts in the sample across all genes [36] . Then, sample level weights and observational level weights were estimated. Using the combination of these two weights in the linear model for statistical analysis can increase power and reduce false discoveries compared to other methods [29] . In the linear model, covariates and fixed effect factors considered included Isolate, TVclass, WUR, sex, RIN, age, and tonsil viral level. To identify the best model to be used across genes in terms of inclusion of the covariates of age, RIN, and tonsil viral level, the backward variable selection method of Nguyen [59] was applied. This method uses pseudo-covariates to control the expected proportion of selected covariates that are irrelevant for the RNA-seq dataset [59] . Factors not subject to variable selection were sex and the combination of Isolate, TVclass, and WUR. After variable selection, the 2-way and 3-way interactions among Isolate, TVclass, and WUR from the selected model were considered for inclusion in the final model. The same method was used when including CE in the model, by considering the first three principal components of each of the significant and nuisance groups of cell types (SigPC1, SigPC2, SigPC3, NuiPC1, NuiPC2, and NuiPC3) as candidate covariates. Storey's method [60] with an estimate of the proportion of true null hypotheses using the histogram-based method of Nettleton et al. [61] was applied to control the false discovery rate (FDR) at less than 0.1 for identification of DEG for Isolate, TVclass, and WUR. In order to understand the biological function of DEGs that were significant for the Isolate*WUR interaction, we evaluated contrasts between AB genotype pigs infected with KS06 (AB_KS06) and AA genotype pigs infected with KS06 (AA_KS06) to identify the DEGs for WUR within KS06-infected pigs, and the same for DEGs for WUR within NVSL-infected pigs (AB_NVSL vs AA_NVSL), High-TVclass pigs (AB_ High vs AA_High), and Low-TVclass pigs (AB_Low vs AA_High). Each of the comparison can be called as a simple effect of WUR. For these simple effects of WUR, we only considered DEGs that overlapped with DEGs for the interaction effect between WUR and Isolate or TVclass, which identifies genes for which the effect of WUR differs between the two isolates or between pigs with high and low tonsil viral level.",

Therefore, we checked the expression of the nine housekeeping genes that were included in the Nano-String CodeSet in the RNA-seq data of these same samples and removed the five genes that were DEGs for any factors or covariates in the model without CE as housekeeping genes, leaving HPRT1, TBP, YWHAZ, and SDHA (for Isolate and/or RIN).

The relationship between RIN score and tonsil viral level in pigs infected with NVSL (A) and KS06 (B). The samples associated with selected samples for RNA-seq (High-TVclass in red; Low-TVclass in green) and unselected samples (in blue) were converted to a color representation. Figure S2 . Plots of each two of top three principle components (PC) for the 28 cell types that were significantly(p<0.1) affected by at least one of Isolate, TVclass, WUR genotype, their interactions, sex, or age. The cell compositions in tonsils were predicted based on the tonsil RNA-seq data using the xCell software. Shapes indicate samples from NVSL or KS06-infected pigs. Colors indicate samples with high or low tonsil viral level. PC's 1, 2, and 3 explained 31.0, 22.0, and 18.4%, respectively, of the variance in cell composition of the 28 cell types. Figure  S3 . Hierarchical clustering of the 200 most variant genes based on upper quartile normalized read counts. Fifty-one RNA-seq samples were clustered to identify any obvious outliers and potential clustering of samples by factors of interest, using euclidean method to calculate the sample distance matrix, and the average agglomeration method to apply hierarchical clustering. The samples associated with the factors of Isolate (white=NVSL; red=KS06), TVclass (white=High; red=Low), WUR genotype (white=AA; red=AB), sex (white=Female, red=Male), and RIN (low \u2794 high = white \u2794 red) were converted to a color representation. Figure S4 . Significant canonical pathways related to immune response that include differentially expressed genes for isolate in tonsils at 42 days post infection when not accounting for cell enrichments based on the RNA-seq data.The expression values of genes with a false discovery rate <0.1 were used to calculate the z-scores and -log(p-values) for each pathway. Pathways shown in this figure have a -log(p-value)>1.3 and an absolute z-score > 2. The height of each bar corresponds to the -log(p-value). The orange color (z-score\u22652) and blue color (z-score \u2264-2) indicate activation and inhibition of predicted pathways, respectively. The intensity of these colors indicates the magnitude of the absolute z-score. Figure S5 . Effect of PRRSV isolate on the pig tonsil RNA-seq transcriptome at 42 days post infection. Only one significant pathway, \"GP6 Signaling Pathway\", was identified in the models without (A) and with (B) cell enrichments, which included the same 11 differentially expressed genes for both models. The genes that were expressed more (less) in tonsils of KS06-infected pigs than of NVSLinfected pigs are in red (green). The intensity of shading is proportional to the fold difference in gene expression. The solid lines between genes represent known direct interactions and dashed lines represent indirect interactions; the blunt arrow indicates negative regulation and \"\u2794\" indicates positive regulation. Figure S6 . Effect of PRRSV isolate and TVclass on the expression of 230 immune related genes in tonsil at 42 days post infection based on the NanoString data without accounting for cell enrichments. A) The most significant signaling pathway, \"iCOS-iCOSL Signaling in T Helper Cells\", that included differentially expressed genes for KS06/NVSL Isolate. Twenty-two genes were expressed more in tonsils of KS06-infected pigs than of NVSL-infected pigs (magnitude indicated by intensity of red color). Only one gene, PRKCQ, was expressed less in tonsils of KS06-infected pigs than of NVSL-infected pigs (magnitude indicated by intensity of green color). B) The most significant signaling pathway, \"Interferon Signaling\", that included differentially expressed genes for High/Low TVclass. Eleven genes were expressed more in tonsils of High-TVclass pigs than of Low-TVclass pigs (magnitude indicated by intensity of red color). Figure S7 . The GBP5 gene was predicted to be more activated or less inhibited, in KS06-infected pigs compared to NVSL-infected pigs based on the tonsil NanoString data when accounting for cell enrichments (p=0.009 and z=1.38). Orange/blue color represents activation/inhibition of the functions. The genes in red/green were expressed more/less in tonsil of pigs with the AB than the AA WUR genotype (magnitude indicated by intensity of red or green color). The dashed lines represent indirect interactions; the blunt arrow indicates negative regulation and \"\u2794\" indicates positive regulation.Additional file 2: Table S1 .
