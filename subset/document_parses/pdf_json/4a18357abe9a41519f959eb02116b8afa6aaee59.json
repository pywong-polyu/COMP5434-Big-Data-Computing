There is a need to identify empirically supported strategies to increase uptake, especially among young adults as this subpopulation has shown relatively poor adherence to physical distancing guidelines. Social normsestimates of peers' behavior and attitudes -are robust predictors of health behaviors and norms-based intervention strategies may increase COVID vaccine uptake, once available. This study examined the extent that vaccination intentions and attitudes were associated with estimated social norms as an initial proof-of-concept test. Method: In November of 2020, 647 undergraduate students (46.21% response rate) completed online surveys in which they reported intentions to get COVID and influenza vaccines, perceived importance of these vaccines for young adults, and estimated social norms regarding peers' vaccination behaviors and attitudes. Results: Students reported significantly greater intentions to get a COVID vaccine (91.64%) than an influenza vaccine (76.04%), and perceived COVID vaccination as significantly more important than influenza vaccination. The sample generally held strong intentions to receive a COVID vaccine and thought that doing so was of high importance, but participants, on average, perceived that other young adults would be less likely to be vaccinated and would not think vaccination was as important. Multiple regression models indicated that estimated social norms were positively associated with participants' own intentions and perceived importance of getting a COVID vaccine. Conclusions: These significant associations highlight the potential value in developing and testing normsbased intervention strategies, such as personalized normative feedback, to improve uptake of forthcoming COVID vaccines among young adults.",

In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) have endorsed numerous empirically-supported mitigation strategies to reduce person-to-person spread of the virus (e.g., wearing face masks) [1] and state governments have implemented physical distancing measures (e.g., travel restrictions, curfews). Despite these efforts, new cases have continued to rise across the fall and winter of 2020, with the U.S. continuing to face record-high numbers of new cases (e.g., 227,885 cases on a single day in December 2020 [2] ). As the virus continues to spread, it has become clear that the most promising strategy for combatting COVID-19 is the rapid development of a prophylactic vaccine which can, optimistically, facilitate sufficient herd immunity [3] . Vaccinologists have made major headway; there are more than 200 COVID vaccines currently in development [4] and at the time of this writing, COVID vaccines have been made available to frontline essential workers and highrisk elderly in some states [5] , and a fully public release is imminent [6] . While these prospects are encouraging, a critical question remains: Will people be willing to get a COVID vaccine, once available to the public?",

Early estimates from May of 2020 show that acceptability and intentions to receive a COVID vaccine are relatively high, but perhaps not high enough to achieve population-wide protection. One study found that 69% of U.S. adults reported being either ''definitely willing\" or ''probably willing\" to get a COVID vaccine [8] , and another found that most U.S. adults reported being likely to get a COVID vaccine (i.e., mean score of 5.24 with responses ranging from 1 = Very unlikely to 7 = Very likely) [9] . Depending on the efficacy and duration of COVID vaccines, experts estimate that approximately 70-90% of people need to be vaccinated to achieve herd immunity [10] , but higher coverage rates are always desirable, especially considering the unknown efficacy of these novel vaccines. As such, there is a dire need for behavioral scientists to identify antecedents/correlates of intentions and attitudes towards COVID vaccinations to inform behavioral strategies that promote uptake.",

Although this prioritization is prudent, COVID-19 incidence rates are highest among young adults, making this age group a major factor for continued community transmission [11] . Indeed, many young adults feel less at-risk for the consequences of COVID-19 and this age group has reported the poorest adherence to mitigation strategies [12] . On one hand, young adults do have lower risk of developing severe symptoms and complications associated with COVID-19 [13] , but because symptoms are often minor, young adults may be less likely to isolate and therefore more likely to unknowingly spread the virus [14] . It follows that vaccination may be especially critical for young adults as a key step towards curbing community transmission, including spread to high-risk people (e.g., elderly relatives).",

            "text": "As it pertains to the accuracy of normative estimates, people tend to misperceive the actual norms for others' attitudes towards and engagement in health-related behaviors (i.e., social norms theory [18] ). Specifically, people tend to overestimate the extent that others engage in health-risk behaviors (e.g., heavy alcohol use [25] ) and underestimate the extent that others engage in preventive or health-enhancing behaviors (e.g., using mosquito nets to prevent malaria [26] ). Related to the COVID-19 pandemic, researchers have found that young adults tend to underestimate how well their peers adhere to the physical distancing guidelines [27] . Although normative misperceptions can facilitate increased engagement in health-risk behavior, correcting such misperceptions has been an effective prevention/intervention strategy that can motivate individuals to engage in healthier behavior. For example, highlighting that most students do not engage in as much heavy alcohol use as people think can motivate college students to reduce their own drinking levels [28] . One proven norms-based intervention strategy is personalized normative feedback, which corrects individuals' inaccurate normative estimates by showing individually tailored feedback contrasting (a) personal behavior, (b) estimates of others' behaviors, and (c) others' actual behaviors [29] . On a larger scale, social norms also can be leveraged within marketing campaigns that entail publicly highlighting the actual norms for a behavior, which can shift perceptions and promote healthier behavior [e.g., 30]. Although norms-based strategies have been successfully employed across numerous domains of prevention science, these strategies are only thought to be effective when (a) peoples' estimates of social norms for a given behavior tend to be inaccurate, and (b) data show that the actual norm is a favorable comparison, relevant to most peoples' estimates. Norms-based strategies may be able to increase vaccination intentions and attitudes, but a key preliminary step entails examining the extent that college students underestimate peers' intentions (i.e., descriptive norms) and attitudes (i.e., injunctive norms) regarding COVID vaccination, as well as demonstrating proof-of-concept that estimated social norms are associated with individuals' own vaccine intentions and attitudes.",

We also asked students to estimate the percentage of typical young adults that they thought would receive COVID and influenza vaccines (i.e., descriptive norms) and to estimate how important typical young adults thought these vaccines were for young adults (i.e., injunctive norms). Across these normative estimates, a clear pattern emerged in which the sample self-reported greater likelihood of getting COVID and influenza vaccinations relative to estimated descriptive norms, and also reported greater perceived importance of these vaccines relative to estimated injunctive norms.

Over the past ten years, the seasonal influenza virus in the U.S. has resulted in between 9 million -45 million illnesses, between 140,000 -810,000 hospitalizations, and between 12,000 -61,000 deaths annually [36] . While these estimates demonstrate the severity of the influenza virus, there is concern that the SARS-CoV-2 virus may be even more devastating. Although direct 'apples-to-apples' comparisons may not yet be fully possible [37] , meta-analytic evidence shows that hospitalization durations are significantly longer for COVID patients (i.e., 14 days) compared influenza patients (i.e., 6-7 days) and mortality rates are higher for COVID (i.e., 6.5%) compared to influenza (i.e., 6.0% for influenza type A and 3.0% for Type B) [38] .

Indeed, the results indicated significant associations between vaccination intentions and perceptions of social norms for typical young adults -highlighting the potential value of increasing young adults' perceptions of how many young adults actually intend to get a COVID vaccine as well as how important most young adults think getting vaccinated is for young adults. Specifically, personalized normative feedback interventions could be a prudent strategy to correct normative misperceptions and could be used by university stakeholders to increase uptake and vaccine coverage on college campuses. The current findings should also be considered alongside existing evidence that norms-based approaches may effectively promote uptake of HPV vaccines among college-aged women [41, 42] , improve attitudes and intentions to receive the influenza vaccine among healthcare workers [39] , and increase Hepatitis B vaccine intentions among men who have sex with men [43] .

Most notably, students reported being concerned about the vaccine not being properly tested and potential unknown side effects. These concerns were particularly prevalent among those who did not intend to be vaccinated, highlighting a key point of focus for efforts to improve vaccine coverage. To increase confidence in available COVID vaccines, it may be helpful to show the depths of the clinical trial protocols and the evidence indicating that the vaccines under development are indeed safe [3] . Nearly a quarter of the sample indicated that they were concerned a COVID vaccine could make them sick, despite evidence against this concern [32] . Indeed, the scientific community has struggled to overcome widespread misinformation throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, but particularly as it pertains to COVID vaccines [44] . This is deeply concerning given that the World Health Organization listed vaccine hesitancy as a top-ten global health threat, even before the emergence of COVID-19 [45] . Nevertheless, apprehension may be warranted given that long-term effects and safety are not yet known. Behavioral interventions or campaigns to increase uptake should also be careful not to invalidate peoples' concerns, which may yield defensive responses and actually decrease uptake [46]. One notable perceived barrier among those not intending to get a COVID vaccine is lack of health insurance or financial means to be vaccinated. Fortunately, COVID vaccines are being made available for free, regardless of health insurance (see details: https://www.cms.gov/covidvax-provider); however, these initiatives will only help increase vaccine coverage if this information reaches the general public. As a final implication, most participants -even those not intending to be vaccinated -believed that a COVID vaccination would work, so simply highlighting the efficacy statistics may not be enough to overcome vaccine hesitancy.",

The estimates presented herein are not intended to reflect nationwide estimates of vaccination intentions or attitudes, but rather to generate proofof-concept evidence from which to build upon. While we argue that high vaccine coverage among young adults will be critical to our overall efforts to combat COVID-19 [11, 14] , the inferences drawn from the current results may not extend beyond undergraduate college students from the northwest United States. Indeed, those with higher educational attainment may be more likely to be accepting of vaccines [17] . A second related limitation is that our sample comprised mostly Caucasian and Asian/Asian-American students, whereas other minority groups have been hit especially hard by the COVID-19 pandemic [47] and may also be less accepting/trusting of vaccines [31] . So, although the current study provides proof-of-concept for the role of social norms on vaccination uptake, more in-depth research is needed to increase uptake within historically marginalized communities and higherrisk groups. The response rate (46.21%) was understandably low given the randomized online recruitment during a global pandemic, as has been the case with other COVID-related studies on this age group [22] , but it has been shown that low response rates do not necessarily bias the results of survey-based research [48] . A third limitation to note is that we asked participants to estimate social norms for typical young adults, so direct comparisons with our sample to estimate the accuracy of normative estimates were not possible. Larger representative data is needed to estimate true and accurate norms. Relatedly, the measures used to assess COVID vaccine intentions, attitudes, and norms may have adequate face validity, but further psychometric validation is a prudent step for researchers seeking to identify antecedents/correlates of COVID vaccine uptake. Finally, it is important to consider the timing of this study given that COVID vaccine development has evolved rapidly, as has public perception of the COVID vaccines [3, 6, 8] . These data were collected in November of 2020 which was before a public release of any COVID vaccines, so we were limited to assessing participants' vaccine intentions while future studies will be able to assess more objective indices of uptake. It is also plausible that people will become more assured that there are not harmful side effects as vaccination rollout continues throughout early 2021 and, as such, research on vaccine hesitancy should continue to be monitored throughout the pandemic. As the public continues to learn more about the efficacy and safety of COVID vaccines, it would be important to further examine the extent that perceived social norms relate to young adults' intentions and attitude towards a COVID vaccine. It is also worth noting that data were collected during a time period in which many in the U.S. associated the ongoing vaccine development with partisan political agendas [49] .",

We first contrasted COVID vaccine intentions and attitudes to those pertaining to influenza vaccines and found that college students, on average, have greater intentions to get a COVID vaccine than an influenza vaccine and also perceive COVID vaccination as relatively more important than influenza vaccination. Nevertheless, intentions and perceived importance was quite high for both COVID and influenza vaccines. Then, building upon recent research by Reiter and colleagues [8] on public acceptability of the COVID vaccines, the current study examined estimates of social norms related to peers' intentions and attitudes towards COVID vaccination as a theoretically important antecedent/correlate of young adults' own vaccinations intentions and attitudes [18, 19] . We found proof-of-concept evidence: Young adults' estimates of the percentage of typical young adults that will get a COVID vaccine (i.e., descriptive norms) and estimates of how important typical young adults think COVID vaccination is (i.e., injunctive norms) were both significantly associated with self-reported intentions and perceived importance of COVID vaccination. These significant associations highlight the potential value in developing and testing norms-based intervention strategies, such as personalized normative feedback, to improve uptake of COVID vaccines among young adults.",
