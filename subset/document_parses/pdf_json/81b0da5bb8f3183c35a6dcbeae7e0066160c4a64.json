COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through respiratory droplets or by direct contact. [1] Thus, it primarily spreads when people who have contracted the viral cough, sneeze, or retch. Upper endoscopic procedures, including esophagogastroduodenoscopy, endoscopic ultrasonography, and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, can increase the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission to endoscopists and their assistants; this is because coughing and retching, which subsequently generate aerosols, can occur during upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. [2] Some devices that prevent the diffusion of aerosol droplets from patients undergoing endoscopy have been developed [3] [4] [5] ; however, the efficacy of these devices has not been validated. Therefore, we developed and verified the efficacy of a novel device intended to prevent the diffusion of aerosol droplets from patients undergoing endoscopy.",

A hole was created at the bottom of the plastic bag for the insertion of the endoscope. After covering the mouth and nose of the patient with the novel mask, the latter was then covered with an off-the-shelf facemask to secure it (Fig. 1 ). The novel mask had a reinforced vertical middle line, which provided for a wider and more stable breathing space, allowing patients to breathe more comfortably; electronic monitoring was routinely needed during the endoscopic procedure. The 3D-printed material combined nylon and micro-carbon fibers into filaments. Therefore, the 3D-printed frames were extremely light (5.5 g) and could be worn easily. We used clear plastic bags, which being commercially available products, were made from polyethylene.",

Marchese et al [3] reported the use of an anesthetic facemask to minimize the risk of virus transmission, and Kobara et al [4] reported using a shield constructed from a vinyl box. Endo et al [5] devised a novel disposable system utilizing nonwoven fabric and a mouthpiece with tips for fixing a belt.
