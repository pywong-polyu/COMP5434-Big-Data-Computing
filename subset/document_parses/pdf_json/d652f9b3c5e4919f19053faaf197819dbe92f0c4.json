            "text": "This chapter attempts to resolve the paradox that despite Trump's apparent disregard for many of the power principles of Neustadt's Presidential Power he has been relatively successful in some respects. It argues that his rules or suggestions were based on a view of 1950s Washington, which no longer exists today. Namely, changes in the political environment have also changed the landscape of presidential power and governance, and Trump reflects those. Three main relevant developments: Party Polarization; the Changed/New Media Landscape; and the Unilateral Presidency are used to explain his resilience. All three enable Trump to maintain a high level of support with his own party, dominate the public and governing agendas, achieve a number of his goals, and keep him a strong contender for the 2020 election.",

Conversely, the previous chapter provided some contrary evidence that Donald Trump has in some notable ways been more successful or powerful than one would predict after applying Neustadt's insights. In this chapter, I offer some reasons why he has done \"better than expected\" as well as provide ideas for other students of the office to ponder given the Trump experience so far.",

Neustadt himself did perform a reflective role in each new edition of his book, with the addition of more presidencies. Additionally, other notable scholarly efforts attempted to alter or adapt his model to new developments. Among these are Kernell (1986) , regarding the role of the public in presidential leadership, given the TV age, etc., and Rose (1991) on how globalization and the end of the Cold War changed presidential power relations, especially in foreign affairs. Along these lines, this chapter discusses three main features and trends impacting the presidential power context in the 2010s, which were not present in the 1950s: party polarization; the new media environment; and the rise of the \"unilateral\" or administrative presidency. In a nutshell, \"Trumpworld\" is not the \"Land of Harry and Ike.\"",

In terms of voting behavior, the New Deal coalition was weakening, witnessed by Republican gains in elections in the 1950s; independents and ticketsplitting also increased. In terms of the party-in-the-government, both Truman and Eisenhower-the main subjects of Neustadt's initial analyses-could count on being able to persuade or gain the support of at least some members of the opposition. As one set of parties scholars noted, \"for most of the Twentieth Century, it was not inter-party divisions but intra-party divisions that required members of Congress to seek allies to pass legislation\" (White and Kerbel 2018, p. 165) .",

He did envision them-at least, via the leadership in Congress-as one possible vehicle for increased presidential persuasion, but rightly saw in the 1960s trends that made this doubtful. \"Instead [of partisan majorities backing the President] the chances are that he[sic] will gain majorities, when and as he does so, by ad hoc coalition building, issue after issue\u2026 Our parties are unlikely to be revolutionized as instruments of government because they are unlikely to be altered fundamentally as voter coalitions differently aligned for different offices in different places\" (Neustadt 1990, p. 157) .",

These changes untethered or at least weakened ties between presidents and their parties (e.g., Davis 2000, pp. 29-31; Rose 1991, pp. 120-121) , as candidates, especially outsiders, did not owe their election to their party. 1 Since the mid-1980s-ironically, when political science was debating their demise-American parties have made comeback, not just organizationally, but in terms of party unity in government. While there is some dispute about how much has really changed in the party-in-the-electorate in the literature (see for example, Dalton 2013), it is rather clear that within Congress, if not the states and even the judiciary, party unity or partisan behavior is at record levels. As one set of Congressional scholars note, \"Party voting [i.e., when a majority of Democrats vote together on legislation against a majority of Republicans] is far more prevalent today than it was in the 1970s or early 1980s. Indeed, contemporary levels of party voting recall the militant parties of the late-nineteenth century\" (Davidson et al. 2020, p. 272) .

            "text": "However, it is the relationship between elite and mass partisanship that is key to understanding the politics of the Trump presidency. On the surface, Trump's \"maverick\" nature, unusual policy stances (for a Republican, as he really wasn't one until recently) presumably could hurt him in his dealings with Congress and other elites. Even having unified government-as he did until 2019-is no guarantee of success, as the Carter presidency's difficulties with Congress showed. Nevertheless, it is clear that Trump's remarkable success with Congress overall in his first two years, as noted earlier in Chapter 6, cannot be explained without strong party ties. 2 Second, and more importantly, at the mass level Trump has engineered a solidly loyal following and effectively made the Republican Party his own, changing its stances to fit his. While some elites may have been-and a few still are-\"never Trumpers,\" the reluctant Republicans in the electorate who held their nose and voted for him have largely been won over during his term into part of his \"MAGA (Make-America-Great-Again)\" base. To return to the point about presidential approval in Chapter 3, Trump has some of the strongest and consistent support among Republicans (in the upper 80s in percent approval) of any president, rivaling George W. Bush after 9/11, and surpassing him in the second term (Jones 2020) . While this level of support isn't unprecedented, it is nevertheless notable given Trump's extreme outsider status, unorthodox political views, and lack of an economic or foreign crisis. 3 The effect of this dynamic translates into his stable ratings over time, and accounts for his strong \"floor\" of support overall. Trump's joke during the campaign that he could shoot someone on the street in New York City and his followers would stick by him is not too far from the truth.",

While that didn't happen, nevertheless, the majority Republicans then blocked all motions calling for the addition of any new witnesses. In the end, only Mitt Romney (R-UT), notably the former presidential standard-bearer in 2012 from the strongest \"never Trump\" red state in the union, crossed party lines and joined the Democrats on one of two votes to convict him. All of the other 52 Senate Republicans held firm to acquit him. This group included those who believed he acted improperly, such as Sen.

Such outlets 5 likewise bolster his influence over his base voters and the elite establishment by extension. Fox had already become an outlet for conservative populist rhetoric and \"community brand building\" before Trump (see Smith 2019), but Trump embodied the network's messaging better than it even could. \"Trump not only tapped into his audience's deep reservoirs of shame, contempt, and resentment that had come into their psyches via Obama's scolding politically correct lectures\u2026 Trump's candidacy gave birth to 'Foxocracy,' a fully aligned, twenty-four-hour, TV-to-pulpit united front of hatred toward liberals\" (Smith 2019, p. 99) .

(Milkis and Jacobs 2017) A notable example is his actions regarding the (his?) wall on the Southern border. After Trump failed to receive funding from Congress in early 2019, following the government shutdown and his capitulation (see Chapter 4), he then declared a \"national emergency on the border.\" He quickly moved to divert funds from certain defense projects to cover it. Congress attempted to rescind the emergency via joint resolution in February, but Trump vetoed it in March 2019, and Congress failed to override. While the wall is far from finished, Trump demonstrated another of Howell's (2005) points-although presidents cannot act by decree and still may be checked, when they do act, they have particular advantages.",

The implications of this new politics of persuasion-for presidents as well as political science-are discussed in the final chapter. Notes 1. In a twist of fate, these reforms-similarly affecting Republicans via state law changes-would also help pave the way for Trump to be nominated, and then elected. 2. As noted in Chapter 6, according to Congressional Quarterly, Trump's success rate with Congress for both of his first two years in office was at record highs -98.7% in his first year (highest ever recorded), and 93.4% in his second year, the third highest recorded (CQ 2019). Needless to say, 2019 was not the same. Some scholars dispute this measure since it weights all votes (bills) equally, and doesn't take into account other factors. It does, however, break out votes by party, and one main reason Trump did so well was not only Republican control of Congress but strong Republican support in Congress-for example, in 2017, he had a perfect 100% rate with House members of his party.",

Even so, at least initially Trump's approval ratings among Republicans held firm. 4. Another noteworthy aspect of the Trump Presidency in this vein is the media relations of the administration, which likewise must unfortunately be given short shrift here. Suffice it to say that Trump and his staff relish attacking the media and collectively are the most hostile White House to a free press since Nixon. The difference is that, unlike the 1970s, media credibility is down to Congress levels, and Trump capitalizes on this sentiment, along with perceptions of media bias and lack of reporting standards, to attack any outlets or even stories he doesn't like as \"fake news.\" As I note elsewhere, this sour and surly relationship is also part of Trump's appeal to and control over his base. 5. Though lately, circa late 2019, Trump seemingly has soured a bit on Fox because of some of their polls and reporting (of news, oddly enough) that he finds not fawning enough. Instead, he has come to promote One America Network (OAN), a more far-right and unabashedly pro-Trump outlet. Still, he has not given up watching Fox or giving interviews to its leading figures like Sean Hannity.",
