The Alpha variant has been associated with higher risks of mortality (approximately 64% in a UK case-control study and 59% in a UK cohort study) [5, 6] and hospitalization (52% in a UK cohort study [6] and approximately 70% in the European Surveillance System data) [7] .",

A pre-print from Denmark also reported higher hospitalization rates with the Alpha variant, but was based on only 128 (of 1235 total) hospitalizations and the difference was only detected in adjusted analyses. [8] Thus, questions remain about disease severity and trajectories (i.e., timing of hospitalizations or death) with VOC compared to the original SARS-CoV-2 clade in North America, crucial information for health system planners. In particular, given emerging evidence that the Delta variant replicates faster and Delta-infected individuals have much higher viral loads (over 1, 200 fold compared to the original wild-type) [9] , there is an urgent need to define the To address this gap in the literature, we examined 30-day outcomes in Canadians infected with SARS-CoV-2 in the first 15 months of the pandemic and to compare event rates in those with VOC versus wild-type infection.",

Our finding of a 42% higher mortality risk with predominantly Alpha VOC infections in Canada is consistent with effect estimates from the UK and Europe. [4, 5, 7] However, given that the third wave in Canada affected younger patients more than the first two waves (at least partially due to vaccination eligibility criteria in early 2021) and the increasing use of proven efficacious therapies like corticosteroids, we also found that the case fatality rate was 27% lower in the third wave compared to the earlier waves, even though hospitalization risk increased by 57% in the third wave.",

[6] [7] [8] Our finding of even higher event rates in individuals infected with the Delta variant confirms reports from Scotland (85% higher hospitalization risk with Delta variant infections compared to those with the Alpha variant) [11] and England (aHR for hospitalization with the Delta variant of 2.26 compared to Alpha). [12] Indeed, a preprint from Ontario has also reported a markedly higher risk of hospitalization and death in patients infected with the Delta variant (with aOR of 2.08 and 2.32 respectively). [13] These findings suggest that communities with high Delta transmission could experience major potential impacts on health system capacity compared to previous waves. In particular, the 8% hospitalization risk in individuals infected with the 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58 are less likely to be tested. [14] However, we examined all positive community cases, which is less biased than studying only hospitalized cases (which prior studies have done) and sample positivity rates were similar in all 3 waves (approximately 5%). To the extent that Alpha or Delta variants infections may have been circulating in Alberta and Ontario before VOC screening began, our results may underestimate the impact of VOC on outcomes since events in undiagnosed VOC infections would be included in our wild-type controls (although the Public Health Agency of Canada update from Unfortunately, the duration of the pre-symptomatic stage (and the frequency of asymptomatic cases) with different SARS-CoV-2 clades are not yet described and cannot be assessed using our dataset. Moreover, as we do not have access to inhospital treatments, we cannot adjust for the impact of therapies proven beneficial in the treatment of COVID (such as corticosteroids) when examining trends in mortality rates.",

[15, 16] The Ontario pre-print mentioned earlier was able to adjust for vaccination status and reported very similar aOR as we did for hospitalizations and allcause mortality with the Delta and Alpha variants. [13] In addition, preliminary data from England has also shown that the elevated hazard ratio (HR) for hospitalization among vaccinated individuals who contract Delta variant infections is not significantly different than the HR for unvaccinated or partially vaccinated individuals (p=0.82). Of course, it deserves emphasizing that the absolute risks for hospitalization or poor outcomes is substantially lower in vaccinated individuals than in those who are unvaccinated or partially vaccinated, even with the Delta variant. [11, 13, 17] While genomic monitoring for the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 VOCs is crucial, [18] we believe it is equally important to describe disease expression and outcomes among patients infected with VOC to fully understand both the disease phenotype and the anticipated burdens for the healthcare system. Although preliminary data regarding the effectiveness of current full vaccination schedules against hospitalization and death from the VOC remain encouraging, [19] [20] [21] continued assessment of disease severity phenotypes in different jurisdictions in vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals and as VOCs evolve is important.",

Of note, although we did not have access to vaccination data in individually linkable form for analysis, it is worth noting that the vast majority of hospitalizations occur in unvaccinated or partially vaccinated individuals: for example, 91% in Alberta since January 1, 2021 and 83% of currently hospitalized patients on August 31, 2021 (https://www.alberta.ca/stats/covid-19-alberta-statistics.htm#vaccine-outcomes last accessed August 31, 2021).A major strength of our study is that the majority of SARS-CoV-2-positive specimens during the Alberta and Ontario third wave were screened for VOC with subsequent genomic confirmation of screen positives, compared with very low proportions in other studies describing VOC disease severity (for example, only 0.7% in the recent report from the European Surveillance System[7]). A limitation of our analysis is that it is largely based on Alpha variant infections, although we do have 30 day outcome data from over 3700 Delta variant infected individuals.[3,6,7] As with other studies comparing VOC and non-VOC infections, our sampling frame may result in overestimates of absolute risks since minimally symptomatic or asymptomatic patients",
