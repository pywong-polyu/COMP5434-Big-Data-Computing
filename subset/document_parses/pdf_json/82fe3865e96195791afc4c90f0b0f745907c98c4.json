Advocates have promoted short food supply chains as more resilient and adaptable thanks to their embeddedness in local economic and ecological networks. As part of a broader case study on challenges facing farmers in local food supply chains in Qu\u00e9bec, Canada, we asked farmers about the pandemic's impacts on food production and marketing in the province, including how food producers coped with these challenges. We sent an online questionnaire to 1,046 farmers who distribute food through direct marketing in Qu\u00e9bec, identified through consumer-facing online platforms. We conducted follow-up interviews with 15 of the 133 farmers that completed the questionnaire to gain a better understanding of their pandemic-related challenges and opportunities, as well as their adaptation needs and strategies. We identified four main types of challenges among farmers: workforce shortages, balancing food demand and supply, changes in sales outlets and marketing channels, and other operational and development issues. In turn, six key adaptation strategies helped farmers reorganize their marketing and sales, which we categorize as: redistribution, streamlining, replacement, collaboration, farm adjustment, and outlet adjustment. Most surveyed local farmers felt well-prepared to adapt to the four major challenges that the Covid-19 pandemic forged or escalated, and our findings suggest that they demonstrated remarkable resilience to additional challenges posed by the pandemic. Our study therefore contributes important insights about how flexibility and redundancy among local farmers stabilized the local food system during the onset of a global pandemic.",

Globally, nearly all food production sectors and operation sizes felt the impacts of public safety measures, including the milk and dairy industry (Wang et al., 2020) , small-scale fisheries (Bennett et al., 2020) , fruit and vegetable growers (Campbell and McAvoy, 2020) , and family farms (Cavalli et al., 2020; de la Pe\u00f1a Garc\u00eda et al., 2020) . In between food security and livelihood concerns, paradoxical situations emerged, especially in agricultural sectors that relied heavily on high-volume foodservice markets like tourism and institutions (Campbell and McAvoy, 2020; Wang et al., 2020) . For instance, 70-80% of fruits and vegetables from the largest producers in Florida are sold to the foodservice sector, so farmers responded to closures and lack of demand by terminating fields or dumping produce during the peak season (Campbell and McAvoy, 2020) .",

For example, online markets were used in Ohio, United States and in the Canadian North to ensure the continuation of local food sales (Radcliffe et al., 2021; Raison and Jones, 2020) . Community Supported Agriculture (CSA), a popular management system in local food systems built on direct marketing relationships between food consumers and producers, has seen a surge in demand over the pandemic (Westervelt, 2020) . In response to the breakdown of the tourism industry in Florida, many producers used social media to distribute food through alternative, local food networks, while new partnerships between packing houses and farmers helped to facilitate direct sales opportunities (Campbell and McAvoy, 2020) . Organizations and farmers in the US and Europe built new connections between food insecure urban consumers and local producers and processors, donating surpluses to food banks, healthcare centers, and churches instead of dumping the food (Campbell and McAvoy, 2020; Cattivelli and Rusciano, 2020; Wang et al., 2020) .",

The literature around local food and direct marketing has emphasized their capacity to build resilience to shocks, largely due to their dependence on relationships rather than on physical infrastructure (Clapp, 2017; Darnhofer et al., 2016; Vieira et al., 2018) . Food systems that create and foster more direct interactions between food producers and consumers are often described as more sustainable and resilient to shocks due to their ability to draw on nearby social support actors and local resources (Chiffoleau and Dourian, 2020; Yacam\u00e1n Ochoa et al., 2019) . Bl\u00e4ttel--Mink et al. (2017) argue that the resilience of CSA springs from the intentional distancing from competitive and volatile global commodity markets. Going further, resilience within food systems is relational and dynamic, rather than a stable state (Darnhofer, 2021; Darnhofer et al., 2016) . A resilient food system must balance the ability to be efficient in the current context with the ability to re-organize, and to adapt in response to unforeseen (or unforeseeable) change (Schipanski et al., 2016; Tendall et al., 2015) . While food systems literature has begun to engage with how to build adaptive capacity to climate change (Soubry et al., 2020; Soubry and Sherren, 2022) , there remains a gap in understanding how local food systems respond to more sudden crises.",

Using a mixedmethods approach, we found that local farmers encountered new challenges related to farm production and marketing due to public safety measures or faced the compounding of previous pre-pandemic problems regarding workforce. Respondents indicated the use of various adaptation mechanisms and strategies to cope with new challenges arising during the early part of the pandemic. Our findings suggest that flexibility and redundancy among local farmers stabilized the local food system during the onset of a global pandemic, and that government measures to address recovery had unintended impacts on farmers' capacity to adapt. These results largely corroborate existing theory around food systems and resilience, but also contribute to a new avenue of inquiry regarding how certain high-level responses can compound challenges for local producers.",

This challenge was often addressed through temporary help from family members and friends. In contrast, few farmers, primarily those participating in CSAs, reported that they received more offer of support than needed due to more time that volunteers could dedicate to farm work. A total of 56% of survey respondents and 13 interviewees indicated that they had problems with getting farm workers. Although a lack of workforce is not uncommon and existed prior to the pandemic, many local farmers explained in the questionnaire and interviews that the reasons for a shortage in farm workers were more varied as a result of the pandemic. Travel restrictions were put in place in March 2020 to limit the risk of virus transmission, which coincided with the start of the growing season for vegetables and fruits in Qu\u00e9bec. Local farmers therefore dealt with uncertainty around whether, when, and how temporary foreign workers (TFW) could enter Canada at a key time. The Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries Qu\u00e9bec (MAPAQ) and Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) announced that TFW were considered essential workers and allowed to enter and work in Canada after a 2-week quarantine (CBC, 2020 Mar 18). Even once TFW were in Canada, one farmer explained, rapid turnover led to a workforce shortage during the peak season and a surplus during the lean season. Three farmers compensated temporary workforce gaps by hiring locals, which, as they explained, was often not an adequate replacement due to the lack of training. A local farmer who did not manage to fill the gap sufficiently reported the loss of several ten thousand pounds of highvalue vegetables that could not be harvested. Some farmers also had to replace their usual international volunteers, so called \"Wwoofers\" (from \"World Wide Opportunities on Organic Farms\"), due to international travel restrictions.",

Some local farmers experienced a spike in demand early in the season, although one farmer explained that the heightened demand was short-lived and only lasted until mid-summer, when many customers were able to harvest fruits and vegetables from their home gardens. In this case, the demand surpassed the supply in the beginning of the vegetable and fruit season and ebbed off towards the end of the season.

Another farmer highlighted that the retention rate of customers buying vegetable baskets from his farm was at around 75%, which they considered high. Several respondents linked the spike in demand with the consumers' concern about a potential lack of access to fresh vegetables due to import restrictions, since countries that export fresh food to Canada may have terminated shipments to ensure food security in their own countries. Farmers considered an increase in food demand as both an opportunity and a challenge, which often required some adaptation (see 3.2.3 Changes in distribution strategy and marketing channels). For instance, sudden spikes in demand posed logistical and planning challenges (e.g., temporal disaggregation of pick-ups). Some respondents also mentioned an insufficient capacity to meet the customers' demands for local food and the pressure to take advantage of this demand.

Finally, temporary restrictions that disrupted inter-regional travel within Qu\u00e9bec were responsible for sudden sales losses among farms participating in agritourism or with roadside stands. For example, an apple producer with customers from Montr\u00e9al explained that, when the city became a 'red zone' (with travel restrictions to and from the designated region), residents from this zone were not allowed to leave or enter the zone for non-essential purposes.",

In parts of the US, sudden closures of entire sectors and the lack of adaptation capacity forced farmers to plow under entire fields of produce, leading to food loss (Yaffe-Bellany and Corkery, 2020). None of the surveyed and interviewed farmers reported food losses due to outlet closures (although one farmer experienced produce losses due to the lack of workforce to harvest). This outcome may have been avoided due to flexible and adaptable food distribution systems in which each producer adapted according to their capacity and consumer demands.

Farmers that did not change their strategy often mentioned that they benefited from an increase in demand for their food and focused on meeting this demand by streamlining their operations to benefit from more efficient processes.

One farmer participated in a 'virtual farmers market' that allowed consumers to order from several local producers online and to pick up products or get them delivered. For many farmers that were new to online marketing, the transition from offline to online sales required additional effort, time, and costs. An unstable and expensive internet connection in rural areas and home schooling limited the opportunity to build online shops quickly in some cases.

Several farmers pointed out that the longevity of this demand hinges on farmer-producer relationships and the nurturing of newly developed and intensifying existing relationships post-pandemic. Further, the government of Qu\u00e9bec has explicitly taken measures to encourage the purchase of local products, including but not limited to food, and put into place initiatives such as 'La Panier Bleu,' a website listing local businesses. It is not clear, however, whether consumer demand alone will or can drive local food systems and where Qu\u00e9bec will hit physical, social, economic, and political boundaries. According to O'Hara and Low (2016), local food sales are more tied to income fluctuations compared to non-local products, raising questions about willingness or ability to spend money on local food if economic concerns arise in the wake of Covid-19 (Zollet et al., 2021) . Hence, to what degree financial commitments, as found in CSA, or household income will determine continued support of local farmers has yet to be seen. Over the course of the pandemic, many communities and jurisdictions in industrialized countries have implemented new infrastructure and started programs to support local farmers which have the potential to turn a short-term solution into an institutionalized practice. In Florida, such initiatives have led grocery stores to commit to buying more local produce and advertising local produce using labelling (Campbell and McAvoy, 2020) . Moreover, technology to connect local producers with consumers may have been an important vehicle for raising people's awareness of the importance of supporting local food producers (Campbell and McAvoy, 2020) . Future research should investigate the longevity and equitability of different local food network support strategies that were built during the pandemic and how they can foster or block equitable and accessible local food systems for all actors along the supply chain.",

Systems with a degree of redundancy can often withstand impacts better since their components are replaceable and independent from distinctive features (Worstell, 2020) . Switching from one sales outlet to another or temporarily replacing a farm worker indicates a degree of redundancy that enabled farmers to compensate potential revenue losses. However, this redundancy may have led to a shift in terms of the number of consumers that have access to local food. For example, the switch from market sales to CSA may have limited access to local food for households with lower disposable incomes. CSA can involve seasonal upfront payments which may not have been feasible for those households due to financial uncertainty in the early stages of the Covid-19 pandemic. Likewise, the transition to online stores may have discriminated against people without internet literacy or the appropriate hardware and payment method.",

As Torry (2020) explains, Covid-19 deepened \"a national digital divide, amplifying gains for business that cater to customers online, while business reliant on more traditional models fight for survival\". As useful as online tools were for the management of contact-less sales and customer relationships, not all farmers -and perhaps many consumers -could use those tools or access the necessary resources at the right time, leaving questions about equality. Although the percentage of local farmers using the internet doubled during the onset of the pandemic 2020, web illiteracy, expensive services to run online shops, or the lack of a stable internet connection may have limited which producers and consumers benefit from online sales. Although not the focus of our investigation, local farmers lacking access to the resources necessary to set up and run an online store or engage in social media and online communication may have been at a disadvantage.",

At least one interviewed farmer stated fear of burn-out due to pressure to take advantage of the rising demand for local food. Some farmers also reported that momentary constraints for employing temporary foreign workers (TFW) led to stress. Despite the dependence of some of our respondents on TFW, the experiences and concerns of TFW working for local farmers in Qu\u00e9bec has yet to be studied. Advocacy groups and the media have called out unsafe lodging and work conditions that put TFW at risk at the beginning and even one year into the pandemic (Mehler Paperny, 2021). TFW may be at greater risk of potential exposure to Covid-19 (Parks et al., 2020) , compounding farm labour shortages and meaning that these workers must work harder to compensate for lost income. Future research should assess how pandemic-related concerns and stress factors have compounded existing or added new pressure on farmers and farm workers.",

Canada's federal, provincial, and territorial government support programs have helped to prevent overall food shortages. However, such programs were developed without a global pandemic in mind and may not have reduced farm stress related to income, labour, transportation, and border closures, leaving it to farmers to compensate for losses (Ker, 2020) . Federal programs like the CERB which intended to support Canadians that lost their jobs due to Covid-19 affected local farmers employing local workforce in unintentionally negative ways, leading to new challenges for those farmers. In many instances, the farmers' family and friends helped to cope with workforce shortages, infrastructural adaptation, and other concerns. Future studies could delve into whether and how social capital helped in navigating transition processes during the pandemic because of, or despite, governmental and provincial programs.",

Using a mixed-method approach, our findings demonstrate that local farmers in Qu\u00e9bec generally managed to address the diverse challenges (e.g., safety protocols, travel restrictions, and other public health measures) that they encountered in the first year of the pandemic (March 2020-March 2021). While many local farmers struggled due to the pandemic, others reported overall positive impacts on their sales and operations. For instance, many farmers benefited from the increased awareness of and demand for local food. Furthermore, we investigated how those farmers navigated new and compounded challenges (e.g., losses of sales outlets, workforce shortages), and how they adapted their businesses, if necessary, to rapidly changing regulations and demands. According to most of our respondents, various adaptation mechanisms helped them to adjust their operations, including the implementation of online shops and infrastructure to ensure safe work and sales environments for consumers, farmers, and workers. At this stage, predictions about long-term impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic on local food systems are not possible. Yet, our results demonstrate that many local farmers were able to withstand most disruptions of a global pandemic in the short-term. ",
