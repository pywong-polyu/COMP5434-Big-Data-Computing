The wide range of baseline physiology, laboratory profiles, radiological findings and clinical outcomes make the management of acute PE difficult to standardise as the pathophysiologic mechanisms differentiating low-risk and high-risk PE are poorly understood. Therefore, currently available risk-stratification scores may be insufficient to guide management for these patients. For example, some acute PE treatment decision pathways promote a reliance on sustained hypotension, whilst others include the finding of right heart strain on Computerised Tomography Pulmonary Angiography (CTPA) [2, 3] . Similarly, currently available treatment guidelines fail to provide a risk/benefit context (e.g. age stratification, underlying cancer diagnosis) to aid clinicians in deciding the most appropriate treatment strategy. Furthermore, information that is easily measured on CTPA, such as coronary artery calcification (CAC), has not routinely been reported or included in decision making algorithms for patients with acute pulmonary embolus. This is despite some existing evidence to suggest this may be associated with mortality independent of PE severity [4] .",

Clinical data comprising: presenting complaint, physiological parameters (pulse, blood pressure, temperature, respiratory rate and oxygen saturations), medications and past medical history were recorded from the admission. Laboratory data, which comprised of full blood count (FBC), D-dimer and biochemical assays (including highly sensitive troponin (hsTnI)) were also documented along with biochemical markers of high-and low-grade inflammation (serum C-reactive protein (CRP) and albumin concentrations). Biochemical thresholds that reflect low-grade inflammation, serum CRP >10mg/L and low serum albumin concentrations <35 g/L, were combined in the Glasgow Prognostic Score (GPS) ( Table 1 ) [5] . Biochemical thresholds of high-grade inflammation, serum CRP >150mg/L and low serum albumin concentrations <25 g/L, were combined in the peri-operative Glasgow Prognostic Score (po-GPS) ( Table 2 ) [6] . Neutrophil Lymphocyte Ratio (NLR) was also calculated (Table 3) [7] . NLR is calculated by dividing neutrophil count by lymphocyte count in a full blood count (FBC) sample result [8] . NLR score \ufffd3 and NLR \ufffd5 are indicative of moderately severe and severe inflammation respectively [9, 10] .",
