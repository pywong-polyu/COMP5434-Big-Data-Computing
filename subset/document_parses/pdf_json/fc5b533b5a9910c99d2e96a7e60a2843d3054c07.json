In addition to the acute pulmonary symptoms of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) (the disease associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection), pulmonary and distal coagulopathies have caused morbidity and mortality in many patients. Currently, the molecular pathogenesis underlying COVID-19-associated coagulopathies are unknown. Identifying the molecular basis of how SARS-CoV-2 drives coagulation is essential to mitigating short-and long-term thrombotic risks of sick and recovered patients with COVID-19. We aimed to perform coagulation-focused transcriptome analysis of in vitro infected primary respiratory epithelial cells, patientderived bronchial alveolar lavage cells, and circulating immune cells during SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our objective was to identify transcription-mediated signaling networks driving coagulopathies associated with COVID-19. We analyzed recently published experimentally and clinically derived bulk or single-cell RNA sequencing datasets of SARS-CoV-2 infection to identify changes in transcriptional regulation of blood coagulation. We also confirmed that the transcriptional expression of a key coagulation regulator was recapitulated at the protein level. We specifically focused our analysis on lung tissue-expressed genes regulating the extrinsic coagulation cascade and the plasminogen activation system. Analyzing transcriptomic data of in vitro infected normal human bronchial epithelial cells and patient-derived bronchial alveolar lavage samples revealed that SARS-CoV-2 infection induces the extrinsic blood coagulation cascade and suppresses the plasminogen activation system. We also performed in vitro SARS-CoV-2 infection experiments on primary human lung epithelial cells to confirm that transcriptional upregulation of tissue factor, the extrinsic coagulation cascade master regulator, manifested at the protein level. Furthermore, infection of normal human bronchial epithelial cells with influenza A virus did not drive key regulators of blood coagulation in a similar manner as SARS-CoV-2. In addition, peripheral blood mononuclear cells did not differentially express genes regulating the extrinsic coagulation cascade or plasminogen activation system during SARS-CoV-2 infection, suggesting that they are not directly inducing coagulopathy through these pathways. The hyperactivation of the extrinsic blood coagulation cascade and the suppression of the plasminogen activation system in SARS-CoV-2-infected epithelial cells may drive diverse coagulopathies in the lung and distal organ systems. Understanding how hosts drive such transcriptional changes with SARS-CoV-2 infection may enable the design of host-directed therapeutic strategies to treat COVID-19 and other coronaviruses inducing hypercoagulation.",

In addition to the acute pulmonary symptoms of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) (the disease associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection), pulmonary and distal coagulopathies have caused morbidity and mortality in many patients. Currently, the molecular pathogenesis underlying COV-ID-19-associated coagulopathies is unknown. Identifying the molecular basis of how SARS-CoV-2 drives coagulation is essential to mitigating short-and long-term thrombotic risks of sick and recovered patients with COVID- 19. In December 2019, the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) coronavirus emerged in Wuhan, China (1) . It has since spread globally, causing societal shutdowns, with nearly 110 million global cases and 2.5 million deaths (2, 3) . Severe cases are often complicated by acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and hyperinflammation, with many patients requiring mechanical ventilation and ICU admission because of hypoxia and pneumonia (4, 5) . However, the pathology of COVID-19 also impacts organ systems and tissues beyond the lung, including the kidneys, gut, liver, and brain (6) (7) (8) (9) , and many of the most concerning distal pathologies have been associated with increased blood coagulation and clotting (8, (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) .",

            "text": "Previous work has shown that increases in procoagulant biomarkers are associated with greater mortality rates for patients suffering acute lung injury (ALI) (15) (16) (17) . In addition, modulation of blood coagulation and fibrinolysis have previously been proposed to treat ALI (18) . Coagulopathies concomitant to ALI and ARDS have been hypothesized to emerge because of interactions of inflammation and the extrinsic coagulation cascade, much of which are through interaction with the vascular endothelium (19) . Although some valid clinical reports have reported rare instances of coagulopathy complications occurring with influenza infection or influenza-like illness, case-control studies have not identified a significant association with these infections and pulmonary embolisms or deep vein thromboses (20, 21) . Even among a study focusing only on the pulmonary pathology of patients with lethal 2009 pandemic swine flu in Brazil, 6 of 21 patients had microthrombi, and only four had pulmonary embolism (22) . Coagulopathies have been observed in coronavirus infection at far greater rates compared with other viral infections driving pulmonary inflammation. For instance, a study of pulmonary pathology of 20 patients with lethal SARS-CoV in Toronto observed fibrin thrombi in 17 of 20 patients. Of these 20 emboli, 12 resulted in pulmonary infarction (23) . From the extraordinarily large pool of SARS-CoV-2 clinical data, it is clear that severe COVID-19 pathology is associated with and partially driven by coagulopathies. One study from Tongji Hospital of Huazhong University found that disseminated intravascular coagulation occurred in 71.4% of patients, with elevated D-dimer, prothrombin time, and fibrinogen degradation products in the blood (24) . A clinical study in the Netherlands reported in 31% of ICU patients with COVID-19 suffered coagulation complications, 81% of which were pulmonary emboli and 27% of which were deep vein thrombi (25) . It has become standard practice for blood-thinning treatments to be administered prophylactically to minimize the risk of COVID-19-associated coagulopathies, and clinical trials to investigate the efficacy of common anticoagulants at mitigating COVID-19 are ongoing (26) (27) (28) .

The extrinsic blood coagulation pathway is affected through the initial activity of the protein TF (tissue factor), which drives the cascading activation of several zymogen coagulation factors, including factor VII, factor V, and factor X. The result of the extrinsic coagulation cascade is the conversion of prothrombin into thrombin, which crosslinks fibrin into a mesh essential for clot formation. The activation of this zymogen cascade is similarly balanced by endogenously encoded inhibitors, including TF pathway inhibitor(TFPI) and APC (activated protein C).

            "text": "Most hypotheses propose that COVID-19 coagulopathies are indirectly induced by acute inflammation and cytokine secretion associated with SARS-CoV-2, but the precise mechanisms underlying coagulopathies remain elusive (38, 39) . Identifying the cellular source of signal transducers initially driving coagulopathy will be critical in understanding and mitigating SARS-CoV-2-induced coagulopathies. To this end, we performed a post hoc analysis of publicly available transcriptomics datasets of SARS-CoV-2-infected normal human bronchial epithelial cells (NHBEs), BAL fluid (BALF) from patients with COVID-19, and COVID-19 patient peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), with the goal of identifying possible etiologies of SARS-CoV-2-induced coagulopathies (40) (41) (42) . Our study demonstrates that changes to the lung epithelium directly caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection may directly contribute to the induction of coagulopathy seen in patients with COVID-19 via the modulation of the extrinsic coagulation cascade and plasminogen activation system. The altered transcriptional profile of the lung epithelium and increased production of TF protein as a result of SARS-CoV-2 infection is a likely contributor to COVID-19-associated coagulopathies in the lung and a possible contributor to systemic coagulopathies. Lung epithelial cells, as the primary target of SARS-CoV-2, may play a key role in the initiation of coagulopathies observed during COVID-19. Such changes likely occur upstream of or in concert with SARS-CoV-2-induced changes in lung endothelial cells, platelets, and immune cell-driven inflammation-thrombosis circuits that may also drive coagulopathies. These findings do not rule out coagulation defects driven by immune cells and the vascular endothelium but suggest that the lung epithelium as an additional factor driving coagulopathy in patients with COVID-19.",

TFPI transcription is not significantly different in SARS-CoV-2-infected NHBEs ( Figure 3A ). TFPI is also responsible for inhibiting the activation of coagulation factor V via the inhibition of factor X. Significant increases in the amount of factor V have been correlated with greater COVID-19 disease severity and coagulopathy risk (50) .

The activity of both protein C and protein S is required for this effect (30) . Protein C also promotes TFPI activity (35) . Interestingly, membranebound protein S also contributes to antiinflammatory efferocytic clearance by mediating membrane dynamics between macrophages and epithelial cells. Decreased lung epithelial PROS1 expression may further exacerbate COVID-19-related pathology through diverse mechanisms (52) .

PLAU (encoding urokinase) and PLAT (encoding tissue plasminogen activator) are significantly increased in SARS-CoV-2 NHBEs (Figures 3C and 3D ). Although PLAU is responsible for both plasminogen activating and tissue remodeling, research has also shown that upregulation of PLAU in the context of lung epithelia can induce increased TF expression and coagulation despite its plasminogen activation (36) . Infected NHBEs also significantly upregulate SERPINB2, which encodes the protein PAI-2 (plasminogen activator inhibitor 2) ( Figure 3E ). PAI-2 inhibits urokinase and tissue plasminogen activator via proteolytic inactivation of plasminogen activators (53) . PAI-2 is commonly cytoplasmic, but membranepermeabilizing epithelial cell death in patients with COVID-19 may drive the secretion of cytoplasmic proteins such as PAI-2 during SARS-CoV-2 infection (54) . The expression of PLAUR, a receptor localizing activated urokinase to the extracellular membrane, is also significantly increased in SARS-CoV-2-infected NHBEs ( Figure 3F ). The localized activity of PAI-2 may significantly inhibit the effect of PLAU/ PLAUR in complex and thereby contribute to the formation of pulmonary embolisms and distal coagulopathies.",

Plotting BALF expression data for this gene list revealed a clear and consistent pattern of transcriptional regulation as well ( Figure  4A ). In addition, plotting of the expression data of BALF differentially expressed genes in the regulation of blood coagulation GO term revealed further regulation of the coagulation cascade ( Figure 4B ). Many of these expression signatures recapitulate the activity of in vitro SARS-CoV-2-infected NHBEs. These include upregulation of procoagulation genes such as F3 (TF), SERPINA10, and SERPINB2 and downregulation of anticoagulation genes such as PROS1 and PLAUR, and PLAT. In addition, PROCR, encoding a receptor augmenting the inhibitory activity of protein S and protein C, was suppressed in BALF from patients with COVID-19. Unlike the NHBE expression profile, there is increased TFPI and PLAT expression in BALF from patients with COVID-19, indicating some antagonism of hypercoagulation. However, coagulopathies observed in some patients with COVID-19 indicate that this signaling can be insufficient to prevent hypercoagulation. ",

Most critically, the master regulator of the coagulation cascade, TF (F3), is not differentially expressed in the context of IAV infection. This would significantly lessen the hemostatic impact of suppressed plasminogen activation. These findings are consistent with the lesser degree of coagulopathy associated with IAV in the clinic and further support the notion that coagulopathies during SARS-CoV-2 infection are independent of systemic inflammation common to both infections.

However, to further confirm these results, we analyzed single-cell RNA-seq of BALF samples from patients with COVID-19. We accessed COVID-19 BALF singlecell RNA-seq data generated and published by Liao and colleagues (42) These data provided strong evidence that pulmonary epithelial cells in patients with COVID-19 are transcribing signals that likely contribute to diverse COVID-19-associated coagulopathies. (Figure 7 ) Figure 7A shows a uniform manifold approximation projection (UMAP) plot representing the celltype-specific clustering of the Liao and colleagues' data. The subset identified as epithelial cells comprised~5% of the total cells sequenced and clustered away from all other immune cell subtypes identified. Figure  7B represents a dot plot depiction of expression data from this epithelial cell subset only, with patient samples stratified by disease severity. Figure 7C depicts the UMAP feature plots, highlighting the cell types expressing each gene and the intensity of that expression. From these data, we can conclude that lung epithelial cells in COVID-19 patients are significantly upregulating the expression of TF, the master regulator driving the extrinsic coagulation cascade. Furthermore, although there is an upregulation of the TF's cognate inhibitor, TF pathway inhibitor, the degree of upregulation is smaller and restricted to fewer than half as many cells. In addition, during severe COVID-19, protein S expression is entirely lost in many pulmonary epithelial cells, where it is expressed at homeostasis. Cells that continue to express the transcript do so at much lower concentrations. These data also demonstrate that pulmonary epithelial cells are significantly upregulating the expression of proteins that suppress the anticoagulant effect of plasminogen. These changes include the upregulation of plasminogen activator inhibitors, such as SERPIN protease inhibitors, and the upregulation of PLAUR, a plasminogen urokinase-localizing protein.",

In vitro NHBE infection data from Blanco-Melo and colleagues further demonstrate that COVID-19 induced transcriptional changes driving the extrinsic coagulation cascade and suppressing the plasminogen activation system are not similarly induced during IAV infection. These data suggest the possibility coagulopathy in patients with COVID-19 may be more prevalent relative to patients with IAV because of the transcriptional changes SARS-CoV-2 induces during infection of the pulmonary epithelium. In addition, through replication of the infection model performed by Blanco-Melo and colleagues, we were able to demonstrate that the changes in mRNA detected through next-generation sequencing were consistent with an increase in the concentrations of secreted and cellularbound TF during NHBE infection. The increase in TF protein concentrations was significantly greater than the detected increase in mRNA concentrations, providing further evidence that epithelial cell-derived TF is a likely contributor to COVID-19-associated coagulopathy in the pulmonary space. It is also possible that such epithelial-derived signals may contribute to COVID-19-associated coagulopathies beyond the lung, but further experimental evidence is needed to confirm a possible mechanistic link. Understanding these epithelial-derived signals and their interaction with other procoagulant signals that SARS-CoV-2 may induce (such as endothelial cell dysfunction, platelet hyperactivation, liver dysfunction, or inflammation-thrombosis circuits) will enable the scientific community to devise more effective ways to mitigate COVID-19 and other coronavirus-induced coagulopathies in the future.",

Acute pulmonary thromboembolism presents in 30% of patients with severe clinical COVID-19 by pulmonary computed tomographic angiography, which is also associated with elevation of serum D-dimer. D-dimer is a byproduct of fibrinolysis degrading crosslinked fibrin clots (13) . Clinicians also reported that biomarkers of coagulation (clot strength, platelet, and fibrinogen contributions to clot strength and elevated D-dimer concentrations) are significantly increased with COVID-19-associated ARDS (14) . A diverse spectrum of proinflammatory mediators shown to be dramatically upregulated in COVID-19 and other coronavirus pathologies are also known to contribute to TF-induced hypercoagulability (55) . Recent work by Stefely and colleagues found marked increases in the concentrations of factor V activity associated with severe COVID-19 disease (50) . Factor V was the most strongly associated parameter with disease severity across all measurements included in the study. Such increases directly indicate that the induction of the extrinsic coagulation cascade is a hallmark of severe COVID-19 disease, and the data aggregated here suggest that pulmonary epithelial cells are contributing factors in COVID-19-associated coagulopathies.",

Much work is still needed to determine how epithelial cell-derived TF and other procoagulant signals induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection contribute to the induction of COVID-19 pulmonary coagulopathies. It also remains an open question whether epithelial cell-derived procoagulant signals contribute to the induction of systemic coagulopathy through distal interactions with other cell types. Other important players in regulating the coagulation cascade are vascular endothelial cells (56) . The possibility of direct endothelial cell infection by SARS-CoV-2 has been proposed as a possible driver of hypercoagulation in COVID-19 (57) . However, there has been a lack of confirmatory data from human patients regarding productive endothelial cell infection by SARS-CoV-2 over the course of the pandemic. For instance, immunohistochemical analysis failed to detect reactivity in postmortem staining of pulmonary endothelial cells from patients with COVID-19 (58) . In addition, recent in vitro studies from two independent research teams found that primary endothelial cells and pluripotent stem cells differentiated into endothelial cells were not susceptible to direct infection with SARS-CoV-2 (59, 60) . Indirect damage of endothelial cells by systemic inflammation or factors derived from infected epithelial cells during SARS-CoV-2-induced ALI is a much more likely driver of these signals. To our knowledge, there are currently no RNAseq datasets with infected endothelial cell cultures or tissue available. However, such datasets would be invaluable in characterizing endothelial cell responses to epithelial-derived coagulation signals or endothelial induction of SARS-CoV-2-associated coagulopathies. In addition, significant amounts of coagulation regulatory proteins, including protein C and protein S, are synthesized in the liver (61) . Liver coagulopathies and dysfunction have also been associated with COVID-19 (62, 63) , and the possibility that liver dysfunction in COVID-19 is contributing to coagulation should also be investigated. Recent work has also shown that platelet activation may be involved in the induction of coagulopathy during COVID-19 (64) . It is very likely that the induction of SARS-CoV-2-mediated coagulopathies is dependent on the interaction of several tissue types driving the extrinsic coagulation system and platelet activation while suppressing fibrinolysis via plasminogen.",

Such factors likely drive paracrine signaling to nearby endothelial cells in the lung, which could further exacerbate coagulation systemically via the secretion of activated coagulation cascade zymogens and thrombin into the blood. It is also possible that such factors could also enter the blood stream directly near damaged endothelial tissues in the lung, potentially contributing to the induction of systemic coagulopathies observed in patients with severe COVID-19.
