Our efforts to increase diversity in developmental biology and related fields are motivated by these factors. However, a fundamental concern intrinsic to scientific inquiry, is the reduction in objectivity in the scientific process and interpretation of data when our scientific community is less diverse. A key safeguard against this, is to have investigators from different backgrounds, experiences, ethnicity, sex, age, nationality, and so on, working on problems from different perspectives, using different methods and model systems. In other words, as Helen Longino (Longino Helen, 1990 ) and other philosophers and historians of science (Martin, 1991; Harding, 1992; Oreskes, 2019) have argued, if the diversity of the scientific community increases, the objectivity in generating new data and in its interpretation increases, leading to knowledge that is more reliable.",

These biases influence decisions on what, who and how to approach questions to find \"truths\" about our natural world. As in all disciplines, developmental biology has not been immune to narrow viewpoints supported by data generated from a largely homogenous community comprised of White males. Women and other marginalized groups have been largely left out, both in terms of being part of the scientific community and in the research process itself. Although, recently the number of White women scientists in developmental biology is currently similar to that of men, the consequences of this exclusion can be observed in the sexism underlying scientific accounts of reproductive biology and the roles of egg and sperm in fertilization (Longino Helen, 1990; Martin, 1991; Harding, 1992) or in the use of embryological and evolutionary findings to support sexism and racism such as those found in the eugenics movement (Longino Helen, 1990; Martin, 1991; Harding, 1992; Gilbert, 2001 Gilbert, , 2021 . Because values play an inevitable role, increased efforts to safeguard against current and future undetected biases leading to erroneous theories necessitates a scientific community with a rigorous peer review process that allows for criticisms and corrections influenced by differences in disciplinary experience as well as cultural and social viewpoints that comprise a diverse community of scientists within peer review groups.",

These communities of scientists are one standard for how scientists work together not only to exchange and scrutinize ideas, but also to advocate and influence the science that will be subsequently published, presented nationally and internationally, and funded. Given the influence of scientific societies on the direction of scientific endeavors, the demographic of their membership is a serious concern to the success and collective impact of scientific research on society (COSSA, 2008; Madzima and MacIntosh 2021; Rushworth et al., 2021) .",

Active recruitment targets undergraduate students belonging to UR populations in STEM and attending a wide range of institutions (Junior Colleges, Primarily Undergraduate Institutions, etc.). Students and faculty complete separate applications that are due in early spring. These applications are made available through the SDB website (www.sdbonline.org/choose_development#Application). A three-person CD! leadership committee reviews all student and faculty applications and selects Fellows based largely on their academic performance, scientific curiosity, and interest in pursuing a research experience in developmental biology or related field. The students selected for the programs are referred to as CD! Fellows. Faculty are selected based on their record in mentoring students from diverse backgrounds, summer availability and research activity. Fellows are then matched to selected faculty based on mutual research interests and the Fellow is supported during two consecutive 10 weeks summer research internships.",

Throughout their tenure in the program, Fellows are provided with multitude of professional development workshops and networking opportunities set up by the SDB that allow them to meet established developmental biologists via Zoom and in person when feasible. Various survey metrics have been used to assess the learning gains in scientific knowledge, understanding of the research enterprise, communication skills, attitudes towards pursuing graduate degrees and remaining in scientific research by the Fellows. The program has continued to seek updates from the Fellows after their CD! support. Mentors are surveyed to assess their mentoring experience, skills and attitudes in participating in the Choose Development! Program and its impact in their lab. This feedback is taken into consideration and modifications to the program are made each year to continue to improve the experiences for the Fellows. Members of the SDB Board recognized a need to increase the diversity of their membership, including UR groups and individuals with disabilities, across all academic levels. The drive to meet this goal led to the development of a comprehensive program called Choose Development!, which was established with funding by the National Science Foundation from 2013 to 2017 (https://www.sdbonline.org/ choose_development). Here, we describe each of the societywide initiatives (Figure 1 ) that has enhanced recruitment and engagement of established SDB members and has expanded inclusion of a wider range of scientific and social topics at our annual meetings that support diversity and inclusivity of all SDB members across social, cultural, ethnic and academic status, and institutional categories.",

Students from institutions where research experience is difficult to achieve are preferred, if academics are acceptable. Students with special needs are encouraged to apply, and a host lab that can provide the needed facilities sought. The cohort of Fellows chosen has ranged from ten to five, with the smaller numbers in years of limited bridge funding. This program has invested funds from the SDB, NIH and NSF on each Fellow's team.

After each team is in place, Fellows and Mentors attend presummer workshops to ensure compliance with all programmatic requirements prior to starting their research projects. Upon joining their summer lab, Fellows are asked to make videos of their summer research experience in collaboration with their Academic Mentors. This activity bolsters the Fellow-Mentor relationship and communication from the beginning of their summer experience. These videos are uploaded to the SDB website and are used during the national meeting to introduce the Fellows to the entire society (https://www.sdbonline.org/ choose_development_fellowvideos). During the summer, Fellows are required to complete and discuss an Individual Development Plan (IDP) with their Mentors. The IDP helps the Mentor become aware of the Fellow's career goals, their experiences and assets, as well as the disciplinary training and professional skills needed by them to achieve their career goals.

I mean I am To ensure continued communication and tracking of our CD! Fellows, the SDB has explored several online platforms that allow individuals to share documents and set up networking and mentoring discussions. For example, between 2014 and 2016, a listserve for each group (i.e., Academic and Lab mentors) and Fellows (current and former), was generated in Trellis, a former online networking platform connecting different scientific communities provided by the American Association for the Advancement of Science. This allowed communication among current and former Mentors and Fellows so they could network and learn from each other as they transitioned out of the program and into graduate programs. Since 2017, the program has moved to the online Zoom platform to hold these meetings. This platform was essential to keep the Fellow-Mentor teams in contact during the summer of 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Online network forums are excellent sources for ongoing interactions between Fellows and Mentors and between Fellow-Mentor teams and the CD! leadership for evaluation purposes that lead to evidence-based modifications of the program. An innovative alternative to face-to-face introduction of the Fellows was started in 2020 by current program coordinator Dr. Richard Behringer, who recruited Nobel Laureates in the field, former and current SDB presidents and editors (current and former) of the official SDB journal Developmental Biology to meet current Fellows at weekly 1 h meetings during their 10 weeks summer research internship (Figure 3) .",

This process warrants that research practitioners engage in a rigorous peer review process wherein scientists engage in presenting their findings, vetting ideas, and rejecting those that are not sufficiently supported by evidence prior to the publication of reports to the public. Because values play an inevitable role, diversifying our scientific community will more likely increase social practices of criticism, and corrections will detect unexamined assumptions, blind spots and inherited biases.

Specifically, he supported the view that embryonic differentiation was driven by all the parts of the cell, but especially the cytoplasm. This view was in sharp contrast to the emerging gene theory and nucleo-centric developmental processes put forth by Thomas Hunt Morgan and his followers (Manning, 1983; Sapp, 1998 , Sapp, 2009 . Although not all details of his view were correct, E.E. Just was correct about the importance of interactions between cytoplasmic factors and the nucleus (Manning, 1983; Sapp, 1998 , Sapp, 2009 . His work and views are worth revisiting within the context of his time and current knowledge that overwhelmingly questions genes and chromosomes as the sole basis of development. E.E. Just's insights and unique life experiences as an African American in the Academe were unlike those of Morgan's whose patriarchal lineage included slave owners and Confederate General John Hunt Morgan (Sturtevant, 1959) . E.E. Just's drive to challenge Morgan was likely due to his ability to see things very differently than his peers (Manning, 1983; Byrnes and Eckberg, 2006; Byrnes and Just, 2015) . Reflection on the important findings and interpretations of their work in developmental biology-both Nettie Stevens and E.E. Just were scientists whose careful observations and insightful interpretations were ignored and marginalized by the White male majority because of who they were-female or Black. As practicing research scientists, we recognize that exclusion practices of all scientific voices severely impair the scientific endeavor. We have helped spark a movement within the SDB to incorporate and establish inclusive practices in its education, training, networking and knowledge-sharing activities as detailed in this report. The momentum to recruit, attract and retain widely diverse scientific minds will lead to continued improvements in the quality of the scientific work we do. This is why diversity in science is important; critical scrutiny of all research done by scientists from different backgrounds leads to better collective knowledge. Understanding the evolution of our natural world is best done by the collective input of diverse developmental biologists",
