Improvements in surgical technique over the past 30 years have increased life expectancy in this rare population. However, the epidemiology of persons living with Fontan is poorly understood. This study aimed to estimate the 2020 and 2030 prevalence of persons living with a Fontan circulation in 11 countries across the US, Europe, Australia and New Zealand, by procedure type: [atriopulmonary connection (AP), lateral tunnel total cavopulmonary connection (LT-TCPC) or extracardiac total cavopulmonary connection (EC-TCPC)]; and age group: [children (\\12 years), adolescents (12-17 years), and adults (C 18 years old)] by building an epidemiologic model. Methods: The annual number of Fontan surgeries by country in 2010-2020 were extracted from hospital or claims databases, via procedure codes. The epidemiology of persons living with Fontan was modelled by applying these surgery frequencies to mid-year populations from 1972 to 2020 and overlaying an uptake curve. A literature search identified: 30-day mortality rates, long-term survival, and median age at surgery. Averages of these estimates were inputted into the model to project prevalence in 2030. Results: The number of persons living with Fontan in 2020 across the 11 countries was estimated to be 47,881 [66 people per million (ppm)], rising to 59,777 (79 ppm) by 2030. In 2020, this population was 55% adults, 17% adolescents and 28% children shifting to 64%, 13% and 23%, respectively, in 2030. Among all persons living with Fontan, 74%/18%/9% are estimated to have EC-TCPC/LT-TCPC/AP, respectively, in 2020, and 83%/14%/4% in 2030.",

In the modern era, the Fontan operation is the final operation of a staged surgical process (at least two major cardiovascular surgeries) conducted to achieve a Fontan circulation. Norwood is performed on infants in the first few weeks of life, followed by Glenn surgery at the age of around 4-6 months and, finally, the Fontan procedure is commonly performed in infants between the ages of 2 and 4 years [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] . As a result of the surgery series, both superior and inferior venae cavae are rewired so that venous return is routed directly to the pulmonary artery, bypassing the heart, thus preventing oxygenated and deoxygenated blood from mixing in the single ventricle [8] .",

            "text": "Although the principles of Fontan surgery have remained unchanged over the past few decades, the Fontan technique has been modified since the original procedure. Thus, there are three types of Fontan procedure: atriopulmonary connection (AP), lateral tunnel total cavopulmonary connection (LT-TCPC), and extracardiac total cavopulmonary connection (EC-TCPC). These procedures were first described in 1971 [9] , 1983 [10, 11] and 1988 [11, 12] , respectively. Over time, TCPC procedures have superseded the original AP surgery [13] , becoming more common in the 1990s [14, 15] , due to the improved survival rates with TCPC procedures [13, [16] [17] [18] [19] . In the early surgical era (1973) (1974) (1975) (1976) (1977) (1978) (1979) (1980) (1981) (1982) (1983) (1984) (1985) (1986) (1987) (1988) (1989) (1990) , the 10-year survival rate was 69% [19] , improving to 89% by 1991-2000 and reaching 95% by 2001 onwards [19] . There is a surgical preference for EC-TCPC in several clinics [20, 21] , based on studies indicating a lower incidence of adverse events (such as arrhythmias) following surgery [19] [20] [21] [22] . However, nearly half of all Fontan survivors experience major adverse events in the years following the procedure [23] . Further long-term outcome data would be valuable to fully understand the impact of the latest procedure modifications [13, 20] . Importantly, robust data are lacking on the current epidemiology of persons living with Fontan.",

Mid-year population estimates for each country were taken from the US Census Bureau [24] . The model was created using the following steps, which were conducted or calculated for each country. First, the annual number of Fontan procedural codes for the most recent 5 years available were extracted from hospital or claims databases and averaged to give a single estimate for the 2010-2020 period. Second, the frequency of surgery conducted in last 5 years by country was applied to mid-year populations since 1972. And third, an uptake curve for the Fontan procedure (overall) and subtype utilisation curves were modelled and used to adjust the annual numbers of AP, LT-TCPC and EC-TCPC Fontan surgeries since 1972. A literature search was conducted to determine survival rates and the median age at Fontan surgery for each Fontan procedure type. Long-term (30-year) survival curves for each procedure type were generated and used to estimate the number of patients alive in 2020. The median age at which Fontan procedure types occurred was then applied to stratify this prevalence estimate by age cohort. The prevalence estimates were then extrapolated through to 2030. The number of Fontan procedures conducted annually was estimated by extracting the most recent 5 years of available data (between 2010 and 2020) of Fontan procedure codes from a claims or administrative database for each of the countries except Australia and New Zealand. For Australia and New Zealand, the number of procedures were taken from the binational registry [14] . Data for these two countries were grouped together throughout the above-outlined steps.",

To account for (1) gradual uptake or implementation of Fontan surgery into surgical procedure catalogue of national healthcare institutions and (2) utilisation of different procedure types between 1972 and 2020; a Fontan uptake curve was created and applied ( Figure S2 ). This uptake curve was modelled based predominantly on data from The Australia and New Zealand Fontan Registry, and it assumed a slow initial uptake of the procedure as surgery teams developed more experience with the procedure [26] . The uptake curve plateaued by 2001 and therefore the average rate of procedures after this point was assumed to represent 100% uptake for Fontan surgeries. In other words, there was no capacity constraint to conduct Fontan surgeries in any country. Using this assumption, the curve was applied to adjust and estimate the average procedure rates in each country between 1972 and 2010. 1.3 Applying subtype utilisation curves to obtain the average annual number of AP, LT-TCPC and EC-TCPC procedures Subtype utilisation curves were developed to model the uptake of each of the procedure types, within this overall rate of uptake. These curves were modelled based on data from The Australia and New Zealand Fontan Registry and the systematic literature review by Kverneland et al. [26] ( Figure S3 ). They were applied to the annual number of overall conducted Fontan procedures by year and country since 1972 to yield annual procedure numbers for AP, LT-TCPC and EC-TCPC by year and country.",

These averages were assumed to apply to all 11 countries, as healthcare systems are similarly developed across these countries and country-specific data were scarce in the literature. 3. Calculation of Fontan prevalence overall and by age and subtype categories, using data derived from literature search Survival curves for the procedure subtypes were created (based on literature-derived survival rates) and used to calculate prevalence of persons living with Fontan. The survival curves ( Figure S4 ) were created using 30-day mortality after the last Fontan surgery as the input for timepoint 0 (i.e. for a procedure type with a 30-day mortality of 10%, the survival curve began at 90% at timepoint 0) ( Figure S4 ). Between timepoint 0, and the first year of input from the literature (10 years post-Fontan), a linear decrease in survival was assumed. This assumption was also applicable between the other years of literature input (for example, between 10 and 15 years post-Fontan). Beyond the last year of input from the literature, a yearon-year decrease in survival of 1.25% was assumed. This decrease is similar to the year-onyear mortality for a general population, and is also in line with reports of a constant 1.3% mortality rate per year beyond 20 years post-Fontan from Dabal et al. [27] . These survival curves ( Figure S4 ) were applied to the number of AP, LT-TCPC and EC-TCPC patients between 1972 and 2020 to yield prevalence estimates. The average age of patients at time of surgery (by procedure type) was then applied to estimate the prevalence split by age group. 4. Verification of the model's outputs Wherever possible, the model outputs were cross-checked with a second or multiple other sources from that country. Published real-world data on Fontan prevalence were available from two studies from Australia and New Zealand (Schilling et al. [14] , Iyengar et al. [28] ) and from one study from Sweden (Dahlqvist et al. [29] ). These results were compared with the estimates from our model to determine whether our data were consistent with the available literature.",

Although data were available for the 30-year survival rates post-Fontan for the AP (48.5%) and LT-TCPC (59.8%) procedures, there were no robust estimates for the EC-TCPC procedure that met the inclusion criteria. For example, Pundi et al.

Estimates for the numbers of children born with a single ventricle heart are available in the literature, but it is not possible to use these as epidemiology estimates, as not all patients will undergo Fontan surgery or survive the Fontan procedures. Most studies published to date are small and/or based on a single centre and therefore cannot be relied upon for robust epidemiology estimates [20, 30, 31] . Our model estimated the prevalence of persons living with Fontan across the 11 included countries to be 66 ppm in 2020, rising to 79 ppm in 2030. In addition, our model estimated that the Fontan population would become increasingly older (55% adults in 2020, rising to 64% in 2030) and that the proportion of persons living with an EC-TCPC procedure type would also increase (74-83%). This model has collated the largest set of multinational data on Fontan epidemiology, and represents the only set of multicontinental data, to our knowledge.

In turn, the model also provided evidence of an ageing Fontan population, as more patients survive into adulthood. This is consistent with another study of Fontan epidemiology: Schilling et al. [14] estimated the prevalence of persons living with Fontan in Australia and New Zealand to be 45 ppm in 2014, rising to 58 ppm in 2025 and 72 ppm in 2045, with the average age of the Fontan population increasing from 18 to 31 years over the same time period. They projected prevalence probabilistically using a microsimulation method and robust data from the long-term Australia and New Zealand registry. Their model also considered more factors relating to survival such as gender and morphology (hypoplastic left-heart syndrome versus other) compared with ours. Our model supports these findings of a growing, ageing Fontan population and suggests this trend applies globally. Therefore, the healthcare support needs of this rare population could increase in future.",

            "text": "This study has several limitations. The average number of annual Fontan procedures for the 2010-2020 period was based on the five most recent years with data available. Therefore, projections both forwards and backwards in time were based on assumptions and potential fluctuations in trends may not have been adequately captured. There could be fluctuation in the incidence of pregnancy terminations, for example, and improvements in the biventricular repair technique [32] [33] [34] [35] may lead to some decline in the number of Fontan surgeries conducted in future. However, we have assumed a steady rate of Fontan and these potential trends would therefore not be captured. It is also unlikely that the databases used to extract Fontan procedure codes have captured all clinically relevant cases of Fontan. In addition, our model did not account for further interventions, such as conversion of Fontan circulation (AP to TCPC), Fontan takedown or heart transplantation, or for the potential for differences in model parameters to be driven by the type of congenital heart defect. It is also important to highlight that the model cannot be used to provide country-specific estimates, as there were not enough country-specific data to populate the model. Instead, the prevalence estimates are 'global' across the 11 included countries.",

Another strength is that the model inputs and outputs were cross-checked with other sources at several stages. For example, the procedure counts extracted from the US COMPILE database were relatively consistent with those reported from the NIS by Akintoye et al. [25] , suggesting that the retrieved data are reliable. Moreover, the model's prevalence outputs were cross-checked with other estimates available in the literature, finding only slight difference between our estimates and those of Schilling et al. [14] , Iyengar et al. [28] (both on the Australia and New Zealand registry) and Dahlqvist et al. [29] (Sweden). However, the similarity between our models estimates and those reported by Schilling et al., and Iyengar et al., are expected, given that our model used this registry as the source of the Australia-New Zealand procedure counts and as the basis for creating the uptake curve. Nevertheless, it is reassuring that there are no large differences between our model's estimates and published estimates of Fontan prevalence in Sweden, Australia and New Zealand.",
