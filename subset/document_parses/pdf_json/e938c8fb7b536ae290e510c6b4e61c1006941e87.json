The study investigates and compares the relevance and comprehensiveness of these psoriasis-specific bolt-ons and the EQ-5D-5L and explores the potential conceptual overlaps between the existing five dimensions and the two bolt-ons. Methods Psoriasis patients were purposively sampled according to age and gender. Semi-structured interviews, where participants were asked to complete the EQ-5D-5L and the bolt-ons while thinking aloud, were conducted. Probes were used to investigate the thought processes of patients regarding the dimensions, wording, recall period and relevant concepts not captured by the EQ-5D-5L and bolt-ons. Data were analysed thematically. A focus group was used to confirm the findings. Results Overall, 16 patients completed the interviews. Sixteen and fifteen patients considered skin irritation and selfconfidence relevant areas to describe psoriasis problems. Three patients considered itching a form of discomfort, and thus, pointed out a potential overlap between pain/discomfort and skin irritation. Twelve patients reported overall 10 general health-or psoriasis-related concepts that are not captured by the EQ-5D-5L, including itching, social relationships and sex life. Eleven patients reported that the recall period of the EQ-5D-5L might be subject to bias because of the daily or withinday fluctuations of their symptoms. Conclusions The skin irritation and self-confidence bolt-ons contribute to improve content validity of the EQ-5D-5L in patients with psoriasis. The qualitative approach taken in this study expands the existing methodological framework for the development and testing validity of bolt-ons for the EQ-5D.",

Such analyses require health-related quality of life (HRQoL) data that enable the estimation of quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). The EQ-5D is the most commonly used HRQoL measure in estimating QALYs, recommended by over 20 health technology assessment bodies worldwide [1] [2] [3] . In general, the EQ-5D exhibits good validity and responsiveness across a broad range of health conditions and settings [4, 5] . However, there may be areas of HRQoL the general public or patients perceive as missing from the EQ-5D, limiting its content validity [6, 7] . Adding bolt-on dimensions to the EQ-5D specific to a certain patient population or culture is considered a solution to improve content validity. A recent systematic review identified 26 different bolt-on dimensions to the EQ-5D [8] . Examples include cognition [9] , sleep [10] , social relationships [11] , vision, hearing and energy/ tiredness [12] . Studies have used different methods to identify new bolt-on dimensions for EQ-5D including qualitative (e.g. interviews, focus group), quantitative (e.g. factor analysis, latent class analysis or pairwise choices) or mixed methods. [8, 11, 13, 14] . However, qualitative assessment of selected bolt-on dimensions is limited [15, 16] .",

            "text": "The EQ-5D is one of the most frequently used generic measure of HRQoL in patients with psoriasis, including large observational studies and clinical trials [17] [18] [19] . Two psoriasis-specific bolt-ons (EQ-PSO) have been developed for the five-level EQ-5D (EQ-5D-5L), one physical (i.e. skin irritation) and one mental (i.e. self-confidence) [15] . Being among the first few bolt-ons, the EQ-PSO was primarily designed to explore methodological feasibility for the development of bolt-ons [15] . During the development of EQ-PSO, four candidate dimensions (skin irritation, skin appearance, self-confidence and social/relationship difficulties) were identified through a literature review, qualitative semi-structured interviews with patients and consultation with a clinical expert, and exploratory factor analysis was used to select the final two dimensions. Improved responsiveness of the EQ-PSO was confirmed in pooled data of three clinical trials using multiple language versions [20] . Although translations exist (n = 48), qualitative evidence documenting the content validity of the EQ-PSO in different languages and cultural contexts is only available from the development study undertaken in the UK [15] . Moreover, it is unclear if there are any conceptual overlaps between the skin irritation and selfconfidence dimensions and the existing five dimensions. An earlier study with burn patients found a moderate correlation between itching as rated on a visual analogue scale and the pain/discomfort dimension of the EQ-5D-5L [21] . It may also be assumed that self-confidence is, to some extent, captured by the dimension of anxiety/depression.",

Interviews were conducted until data saturation, whereby additional interviews did not generate any important new themes in the qualitative analysis [23] . Study inclusion criteria were as follows: i) aged 18 years of above; ii) diagnosed with psoriasis by a dermatologist; iii) cognitive ability to read and interpret questions in Hungarian and iv) signed written informed consent.

The interview procedure combined elements of concurrent think aloud, where participants verbalize their thoughts while completing the questionnaire, and verbal probing [24] . We used this approach as we were interested in exploring patients' underlying thought processes rather than exact responses to the questionnaire items. [25] . A topic guide was developed by the research team that included a dermatologist with experience in treating psoriasis patients. After the pilot-test with two patients, small revisions were made to the topic guide including adding a ranking question about the most and least relevant dimensions. The final interview guide comprised of three sections. In the first section, the aims of the study and the interview process were explained to each patient. Then they were asked about their experiences with psoriasis and important aspects of health and health-related quality of life and how these were impacted by psoriasis. In the second section, patients completed the EQ-5D-5L descriptive system, followed by the EQ VAS and EQ-PSO descriptive system (i.e. five core dimensions and the two bolt-ons).

Furthermore, some of the missing concepts identified by psoriasis patients are covered by already existing EQ-5D bolt-on dimensions, such as social relationships or sexual activity [11, 29] . The patient sample almost unanimously confirmed the relevance of the skin irritation and self-confidence bolt-on dimensions to their experience with psoriasis. The majority of patients described these as the two most important aspects of HRQoL in psoriasis. In most cases patients interpreted the EQ-5D-5L or EQ-PSO dimensions as generic and not related to any specific condition. However, in a few instances, certain words or phrases were interpreted as being related to psoriasis. The most prominent example was seen at the selfcare dimension, whereby one-fifth of patients interpreted 'dressing myself' not as an ability to dress but rather as psoriasis influencing the clothes they can wear. Similarly, few patients used the EQ VAS as a scale that measures the proportion of body surface area affected by psoriasis. We believe that mode of administration and the context of the study may be, at least in part, responsible for this effect. Patients were aware of participating in a psoriasis-related interview and this might have led them to overly focus on their skin problems when completing the questionnaires.",

Yet other patients thought differently and reported itch only in the skin irritation dimension. These disagreements may be attributable to the multifaceted nature of psoriasis. Given the large variability of skin and joint symptoms, including different clinical manifestations, localisations and symptoms, no two patients experience psoriasis the same way. For example, the focus group discussion highlighted that some patients experience itch, while others only report skin scaling, and for others joint symptoms are more bothersome than those of the skin. Based on our results, the skin irritation dimension seems to be a useful bolt-on in this population that might cause some (minor) overlap with pain/discomfort. Conversely, the focus group confirmed that the self-confidence bolt-on dimension is independent from the other dimensions of the EQ-5D-5L and represents a standalone value.",

Scale development and valuation implications, such as keeping the number, length and wording of the new dimensions reasonable should also be taken into account. It is possible therefore that what patients consider missing or suggest to improve may confront the researchers' aims and a judgement has to be made as to whether those limitations are sufficient to warrant changing or adding to the measure. For example, during the concept elicitation section of our study, the problems caused by skin scaling were raised by more patients than itching. In agreement with this, several patients proposed extension of this dimension by adding other frequent psoriasis skin symptoms beyond itching. However, by doing so, one may risk of creating a double-barreled question in the skin irritation dimension. Furthermore, when valuing health states, members of the general population may easily imagine itching, while imagining other skin symptoms, such as skin scaling that they most likely have never experienced, could be challenging.",

Self-selection bias may also be present as patients voluntarily applied to the study. It is possible, for example, that willingness to participate in such an interview or being a member of a patient association are not independent from one's self-reported health or selfconfidence. Data were collected through two different modes of administration (face-to-face and video-interviewing) which could be a source of potential influence on responses but majority used one mode and there were no differences in what was reported across the modes. Another limitation is that as a substantially large pool of experimental bolt-on dimensions are available for the EQ-5D, it could have been possible to include further bolt-ons in our study, especially those that one may anticipate to be relevant for psoriasis patients (e.g. social relationships, sleep). Lastly, there may be minor differences in semantics between the Hungarian and other language versions of the EQ-5D-5L and EQ-PSO which may prevent the generalizability of these findings to other countries.",
