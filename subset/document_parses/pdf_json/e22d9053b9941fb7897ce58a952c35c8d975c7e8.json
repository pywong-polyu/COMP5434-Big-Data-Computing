            "text": "Teaching of clinical decision-making is an important component of health professions education. Patient case examples are widely used in didactic coursework to teach this material, but engaging all learners in large, lecture-based courses remains a challenge. Interactive fiction (IF), a digital choose-your-own-adventure media, provides an accessible way for students to individually explore the narrative of a patient-case in a safe environment. Here, we report the development of interactive, digital patient-cases (eCases) using Twine, a free IF development platform. Fourteen eCases were developed in collaboration with 11 faculty members and were used in seven different PharmD courses over three semesters. eCase content was developed by faculty members for their respective instructional topics and accessed via Web browsers on students' personal electronic devices. eCases were received positively by students, with > 90% of students reporting that eCases were easy to use, helped them learn the material at their own pace, and gave them an opportunity to learn from mistakes. Student self-perceived confidence also increased significantly after eCase use. Faculty reported that eCases took more time to develop than conventional cases, but were easier to deliver and provided better student engagement. IF is an accessible media for creating and delivering low-fidelity interactive patient cases that can engage all students in a large class. eCases allow students to apply their knowledge, practice clinical decision-making, and safely learn from their mistakes. eCases are versatile and well suited for both in-person and virtual teaching across a variety of health professions programs to teach clinical decision-making.",

            "text": "Healthcare professions graduates must perform sound clinical reasoning and solve therapeutic problems in high stakes environments. In medical and pharmacy school curricula, these skills are often first introduced in preclinical courses using patient cases, prior to engagement with real patients during experiential learning [1] [2] [3] . Delivery of case-based sessions in a large classroom generally includes guiding students through the details of a patient case from presentation to treatment [1] . This may be augmented by active learning strategies, including audience response systems, Socratic questioning, role play, and games [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] . According to Knowles' principles of adult learning, learning should be problem-centered, have immediate relevance to the learner, emphasize experience including making mistakes, and include learners in planning and evaluation [11] . Conventional case delivery is problem-centered, but the majority of the literature to support case-based learning is in the context of small group sessions rather than large classroom lectures. With larger class sizes, it is difficult to engage multiple learners at different levels and for instructors to provide prompt, individualized feedback to correct mistakes [8, 12] .",

This is accomplished without the risk of harming a real patient [18] . In a review of VPs for medical education, it was noted that they are best suited for teaching clinical reasoning [17] . These types of programs may also provide student performance data to faculty to allow them to formatively assess students and target further instruction [19] . However, VPs require significant financial resources and time to develop and deploy [16] [17] [18] .

            "text": "To meet these needs, we developed interactive, electronic patient cases (eCases) using Twine, a free, open-source tool for creating interactive fiction (IF) [20] . IF is a digital media for delivering computer-based \"choose-your-own-adventure\" stories. IF was first used in the 1970s with the advent of personal computing [21] and is typically used to develop textbased adventure games, where players take on the role of a character to explore the outcome of a series of decisions [22, 23] . The underlying principles of IF are the same as printed \"choose-your-own-adventure\" books: choices made by the reader lead to different results, different subsequent choices, and different outcomes, thus moving the narrative towards a final end result [23] . When leveraged for learning in health science education, this process parallels clinical decisionmaking. Different learners select different tests to order and medication(s) to prescribe, and these choices lead to different results, different choices at follow-up, and ultimately different patient outcomes. The digital nature of IF grants the ability to track, store, and adjust variables (e.g., medication dose, lab values, time, number of adverse events, questions asked, etc.), the potential to make multimodal choices (e.g., multidrug therapeutic regimens at varying doses), the capability to collect, assess, and report user progress in real time, and the potential to scale distribution to a class of any size. To our knowledge, there are no currently published reports on the use of IF in pharmacy or medical education. The purpose of this study is to describe the development, implementation, and student and faculty response to eCases using IF in a PharmD curriculum.",

For student choices that do not lead to immediate success or failure, students are provided information about the patient response to the selected treatment ( Supplementary Fig. 1K ).

This approach provides a method for teaching and practicing clinical decision making that is accessible across multiple levels of material and learner capabilities. eCases were well received by students and faculty alike, and were perceived to be useful, affordable, and worthwhile, permitting successful uptake in our PharmD curriculum. The IF framework is designed for creating narrative games. Thus, the framework is well-suited for bringing elements of gaming, or gamification, into the learning process. Gamification has been shown to enhance learner engagement and introduce fun in both pharmacy and medical education [19, 24, 25] . The IF framework used here leveraged game elements to engage learners in exploring clinical case scenarios [25] . The IF development platform is flexible, allowing eCases to be created for a wide variety of topics, and spanning different levels of complexity for different levels of learners (from the first professional year through continuing education). The general structure of all eCases adhere to the same andragogical principles, but no unified template is required, meaning that the types of user input and choices, outcomes, and feedback can be customized for each topic. The method of deployment is equally flexible, permitting implementation specific to the needs of individual courses or topics. This has become especially apparent with eCases developed and used after classes were moved online in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. As there are free platforms available for creating IF, student-worker or programmer time to code the eCases is the only cost associated with development and deployment. eCases are similar to virtual patients (VPs) in that they both promote application of clinical knowledge and skills within a digital environment, thus allowing students to practice patient care without risk to actual patients [13, 14, 17, 18, [26] [27] [28] . A hallmark of VPs is their use of natural language processing and realistic graphical interfaces to create a user experience that mirrors real-life patient interactions-a feature that is intended for practicing communication and open-ended information gathering [17, 29, 30] . These features have not consistently been shown to be of benefit to learners [17, 29] . In a randomized trial, a menu-driven virtual patient was found to be more helpful for structuring clinical information and more suitable for pre-clinical learners [30] . eCases forego the highfidelity approach in favor of focusing on therapeutic decisionmaking and responding to patient outcomes, which are thought to be primary strengths of teaching with VPs [17, 31] . This lowfidelity approach requires significantly less time and resources to develop and deploy. The time to develop a VP case has been reported to take from 22 to over 50 h to create [14, 32] , while eCases took an average of six to 10 h to develop. Furthermore, the costs to develop VPs has been reported to be > $10,000 [27] and may be charged by student ($75/year) and faculty ($1100) user [14] resulting in higher costs for larger class sizes and limiting replayability across different groups of learners. In contrast, there are multiple, free IF development platforms, and the only cost to developing an eCase is paying for the coding, which is a one-time expense. eCases can be accessed and replayed by as many users as the faculty author allows.",

This tracking allows faculty to identify errors in thinking and further target teaching towards learner needs, thus keeping instruction learnercentered [19] . eCases can likewise track student selections and a real-time report is available for instructor use in the live or virtual classroom. While our faculty chose to collect this data anonymously, it is feasible to link student choices with an identifier (e.g., student ID number). Student survey response rates varied depending on the eCase and course, and generally were higher when the instructor provided time to complete the survey in class. Students reported that the eCases were easily accessible, helped them to learn the material, facilitated learning from mistakes, and allowed them to learn at their own pace. The ability to explore multiple patients and outcomes within a single eCase creates a high replay value for students. Though impact on student performance was not directly measured in this analysis, students consistently reported significantly increased confidence in applying knowledge following the utilization of the eCases. The high levels of student satisfaction with eCases compared to traditional case delivery is consistent with that previously reported for other virtual case media [14] . Student feedback remained positive when eCases were used for online classes in Spring 2020.",

Beyond this initial investment, little or no effort is required to use the same eCase for future course offerings. The ability of eCases to give class-wide formative assessment of student progress was highly valued among faculty. Whereas with large lectures or smaller breakout groups the instructor can only interact with one student or group at a time, the digital feedback provided by eCases allows the instructor to get a snapshot of the entire class's understanding. This has allowed instructors to address misconceptions or gaps in knowledge. It also provides insight into students' approach to clinical decision-making in their pre-clinical years, which has historically been challenging to characterize [33] .",
