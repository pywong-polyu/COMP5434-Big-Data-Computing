In addition, we assessed the predictive power of conventional point of interest data, confirming that telecommunication data is superior. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to predict the spread of COVID-19 from telecommunication data.

One approach is to quantify mobility using point of interest (POI) data obtained from check-ins [3, 8, 11] or smartphone location logs [5, 8, 10, 25 ]. An alternative is to extract mobility patterns from telecommunication data [35] . Telecommunication data is regarded to provide a more comprehensive coverage of a country's population [16, 33] . In particular, telecommunication data have, unlike POI data, the advantage of capturing routine activities that might not otherwise be recorded. Telecommunication data originates from cell phone pings and thus track all SIM card movements, regardless of which hard-or software is used by the phone. Motivated by this, several research commentaries have discussed the potential benefits of telecommunication data for monitoring the spread of COVID-19 [16, 33] . However, research actually evaluating the predictive power of telecommunication data for forecasting the spread of COVID-19 is still lacking. This represents the objective and novelty of the present work.",

Stochastic models mainly rely on the predictive power of data, while mechanistic models explicitly utilize epidemiological theory and empirical evidence. An example of a stochastic model often used in the early stages of disease spread is an exponential model [4] . Another example of a stochastic model is a Gaussian model, which is used to predict the peak of COVID-19 cases [39] . Both models predict future cases solely from past cases. Recent efforts have incorporated additional predictors. In the case of COVID-19, predictors have been derived from behavioral data such as visitor counts for POIs or call data, and used been used in regression models [38] and machine learning models [20, 45] . However, machine learning models are of limited use in emerging epidemics due to their need for large historical training data. Yet, in epidemic forecasting, such large historical training data are typically not available.",

The accuracy of the triangulation has been tested and amounts to a median error of 132 meters [19] . Location data was recorded at a resolution of approx. 5 minutes. This ensures that our data capture micro-level movements of individuals of high granularity. Third, the movements were used to compute trips. A trip is registered when a SIM card moves between two different postcode areas and the destination location has been static for at least 20 minutes. Fourth, trips were classified by their mode of transport (\"train\", \"road\", and \"highway\") and their purpose (\"commuter\" vs. \"non-commuter\"). The mode of trips is determined via the positions of antennas along train rails, highways, and roads. If a trip uses multiple modes of transport, it is classified as the mode that covered the longest distance. \"Commuter\" and \"noncommuter\" trips are differentiated based on extracted home and work locations of individuals. Details are reported in the Swisscom Mobility Insights [41] . Fifth, trips were aggregated for each day and region. This results in an origin-destination matrix of mobility flows. We then derive within-and between-region mobility covariates. The within-region mobility covariate is calculated as the reduction in within-region trips at a given day relative to a reference period (here: the average daily trip count during the two weeks before the first Swiss COVID-19 case). The between-region covariates are for each region calculated as the total number of trips into the region per every other region.",

Again, we find that the predictions fit the actual case numbers well. For the canton of Geneva (GE), predictions appear too conservative. A closer inspection revealed that case counts in Geneva peaked considerably later than in other cantons, and also much later compared to the reduction in mobility. Nonetheless, the predictions of the best baseline (i.e., the neural network from [45] ) were also too conservative.

However, empirical evidence concerning its effectiveness for forecasting is lacking. We find that using POI data results in a 10.57 % higher RMSE, thus reflecting a substantially inferior predictive power. A reason for this is that telecommunication data have larger coverage; it includes every mobile device independent of the operating system and does not require manual opt-in [6] . Another advantage of telecommunication data is, they they are measured with high frequency (e. g., daily), thereby enabling regularly updated forecasts as needed by decision-makers. Future research and practice is therefore encouraged to consider the use of telecommunication data for quantifying mobility.",
