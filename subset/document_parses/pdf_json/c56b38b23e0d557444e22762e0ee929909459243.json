With the continuous development and advancement of computer and communication technologies, telecare is gaining more and more attention and has become an important part of medical information technology construction. Falls endanger the elderly and other special populations, especially after a sudden but unassisted fall, which may be life-threatening. Timely fall detection and rescue can win valuable time for treatment and rescue, which is very important to protect users' health and improve medical monitoring. In order to provide better medical care to the elderly population and reduce the harm caused by falls, this paper will focus on the fall problem of the elderly in telecare. In order to facilitate the detection of falls of the elderly, we design an Android sensor-based data acquisition scheme, using the built-in acceleration sensor in the Android system to collect the human acceleration information, and through the JMS middleware technology, the collected data are transmitted to MATLAB for analysis and processing in real time. is paper preprocesses and synthesizes the collected human body data and visualizes the acceleration changes of various typical daily activities of the human body and breast cancer, then extracts the relevant data features according to the synthesized SVM curve, constructs a pattern recognition algorithm using the extracted features, and verifies the effectiveness of the pattern recognition algorithm through experiments.",

            "text": "According to the latest statistical results published by the National Bureau of Statistics, the aging population in China has reached 200.2 million people at this stage. According to various statistics, China has entered the aging society since 2000, and the aging process of China's society has been deepening in the last decade [6] [7] [8] . e implementation of family planning policies in China has led to a significant decrease in the number of newborns, coupled with the fact that the values of the Chinese people have changed significantly, and the structure of families tends to be smaller, with children preferring to live separately from their parents [9] . As a new medical model, it is widely used in various medical fields such as telemedicine education, telemedicine, and telehealth. Telemedicine systems not only save patients money on medical costs but also have a very positive effect on the detection and treatment of diseases such as many chronic diseases. Nowadays, population mobility is more frequent than before, and more young people are moving to big cities, leaving little time for their families, resulting in an increasing number of \"empty nest families\" [10] . e aging of the population has become a serious social problem, and the problem of \"empty nest families\" has increased people's concern about the elderly, which has led to the problem of health care for the elderly [11] [12] [13] . In the above-mentioned social context, the health of the elderly has become one of the most important issues to be solved in today's society [14] . Nowadays, the demand for medical equipment for the elderly is increasing year by year. In the traditional guardianship mode, the elderly need to be sent to the hospital, and then with the help of the testing equipment in the hospital, the physical examination is carried out, and then the diagnosis report is issued by the doctor, and sending the sample not only brings great inconvenience to the patient's life but also brings expensive economic pressure [15] [16] [17] . With the continuous development of computer and communication technology, a new medical care model of telecare delivery has emerged, which can well solve the shortcomings of the traditional model and bring real-time telecare services to users. erefore, the study of elderly breast cancer complications detection in telecare highlights its important practical significance. If a breast cancer detection system that is easy to carry, accurate in detection, and timely in judgment can be developed, which can provide timely detection of breast cancer and can send out help information at the first time, on the one hand, it can win precious time for treatment and rescue and reduce many unnecessary losses, which is on the other hand, it can improve the quality of life of the elderly, enhance their ability to live independently, provide real-time protection for their health, and reduce the burden of their families and society. Program nursing is a kind of care that combines modern communication, computer and modern medicine and other advanced technology means, disease diagnosis, and treatment for the purpose of providing remote medical assistance services for patients. e continuous development of modern computer and communication technology and the application of more and more new technologies have gradually brought telecare into the sight of the general public, and its service model has been developing and improving. In particular, with the spurt of mobile Internet and new concepts such as Internet of ings and cloud computing, more and more research institutions and scholars are paying attention to telecare and continuously enriching the discipline of telecare to make it more efficient, humane, and intelligent. From these, the forward fall appears at two different peaks, the first peak is slightly lower than the second, and by intuitive judgment of the fall position we can see that the first peak is caused by the human knee touching the ground, and the second occurs when the entire body touches the ground, two peaks appeared during weightlessness.",

In addition, the elderly are more reactive and less flexible than young people, and their ability to control the body's dynamic balance is also greatly reduced. e decline in all physical indicators leads to changes in gait of the elderly, the pace of walking becomes smaller, and the swing of the arms is reduced, thus causing instability of the body weight. According to the statistics of 110 patients admitted to a hospital from 2011 to 2013, there were 60 male patients and 50 female patients, and 80 patients over 60 years old, accounting for 73% of all patients.

For example, if the lighting in the stairway corridor is poor, it is easy to fall when going up and down the stairs because you cannot see the steps. e endurance means the skeletal and muscular system of the elderly degenerates, and the absorption capacity of the trace elements required by the human body becomes weaker. A large number of statistical studies have shown that the probability of falling is much greater outdoors than indoors. e outdoor environment is relatively complex and people may not be able to adapt quickly to the environment, so they are prone to falls and other unexpected situations.",

Its detailed system framework is shown in Figure 3 . ere are many kinds of human parameters that need to be measured in telecare, such as body temperature, blood saturation, electricity, pulse, respiration, and movement status. Different signals require different acquisition devices and acquisition methods. rough the analysis and introduction in the previous chapters, we know that the information of human body acceleration can reflect whether the human body is in the normal activity state or in the special condition such as fall, so we need to acquire the relevant human body data. Convenient and intelligent perception of the surrounding environment, its lightweight, and intelligent features are also very suitable for remote control, so this chapter will focus on using the built-in acceleration sensor in the Android system to obtain the acceleration information of the human body. Nowadays, smart phones have long become an indispensable part of people's daily life, and a lot of information exchange is also done based on hand, and cell phones have gradually developed from blue-screen and color-screen phones that could only make phone calls and send text messages to smart phones with high screen resolution, superior performance, and more and more complete functions. In fact, the general smart phones now have many built-in sensors, i.e., most smart phones are equipped with acceleration sensors, gravity sensors, pressure sensors, rotation vector sensors, gyroscope sensors, etc. ese builtin sensors can provide data well and accurately, so the smartphone can be selected as the data acquisition device for the fall detection system in this paper. e main parameters of the cell phone selected in this paper are as follows: the system version is Android0S4.3; the CPU is Qualcomm Snapdragon 800 (MSM827); and the built-in acceleration sensor model is LIS3DH3-axis, which is produced by STMicroelectronics and has the advantages of low power consumption and small size. Advantages: very suitable for motion-sensitive occasions or motion space is relatively limited, and the power consumption requirements of low occasions, in \u00b12g, \u00b14g, \u00b18g, \u00b116g of the full range, have good stability and accuracy, and the accelerometer chip has a built-in temperature sensor and H-way analog-to-digital converter and can be simply integrated with accompanying chips such as gyroscopes to achieve various functions such as motion data measurement and 4D/6D direction detection. e main functional characteristics of the acquisition device and the H-axis acceleration sensor LIS3DH are shown in Figure 4 . e data acquisition is mainly done by acquiring the accelerometer data from the phone through the acquisition program. e system interface wraps the acceleration sensor and provides a sensor class that can get the required value according to the type of sensor. Since the sensor values are frequency-based and return a value every fixed time, a trigger mechanism is needed to listen to the sensor with events. Whenever the accelerometer detects a change in the accelerometer, a sensor event is generated. A sensor event is an object from which the program gets the acceleration value.",

And for the characteristics of the mobile terminal system, the low-power museum research is conducted to improve the practicality of the system. In the future, you can set a threshold value, and if the SVM peak exceeds that threshold, you will find that there may be a suspicious decrease at that time and the data close to that peak will be analyzed.",
