Using clinical trials in HIV-associated cryptococcal meningitis as a case study, we conducted a systematic review to determine how inclusive and representative trials have been across the course of the HIV epidemic. We identified 39 studies. There was a geographical shift with trials moving from the USA to Africa and Asia over time. We found that recent trials were conducted in areas heavily affected by cryptococcal meningitis, but we did identify geographical areas and patient groups that have been underrepresented. We also found inequality within authorship that was skewed towards male researchers from high-income countries. These findings outline areas for our discipline to focus on. We can also use this study as a benchmark from which to monitor our progress over time. This is a broad methodology that could be adopted and adapted by other research groups.",

Concerns have been raised that clinical trials are disproportionately conducted in a limited number of countries [4] [5] [6] [7] and that individual researchers and institutions from high-income countries (HICs) disproportionately benefit from global health research [8] , leading to calls to examine and potentially reform how global health research is conceptualised and conducted. The emergence of the HIV epidemic was a catalyst for huge investment in global health, both in terms of research and service provision [9] . This expansion in investment led to the creation of a large number of transnational research partnerships (TRPs), whereby institutions in HICs partnered with those in low-and middle-income countries (LMICs) to collaborate on research studies [10] . As a consequence, an increasing number of research publications in the field of HIV are published each year, and the number of countries contributing to HIV research continues to grow [11] . This research has contributed to dramatic reductions in the number of new infections and deaths due to HIV over the last 30 years. Despite this, an estimated 1,700,000 people were newly infected with HIV, and 690,000 AIDS-related deaths occurred in 2019 [12] , with sub-Saharan Africa at the centre of the epidemic. There remains a clear need for further research in prevention, treatment, and implementation. Ongoing research needs to be appropriate to the research setting, address high-priority research questions [13] , and include representative patient populations in order to generate applicable and generalisable findings [14] .",

Individuals and institutions from HICs lead the research, and researchers from LMICs are often found in the middle of author lists or excluded altogether from publications arising from African health research [15] .

Over the past 30 years, clinical trials have defined treatment strategies that have led to a dramatic reduction in 10-week mortality rates from almost 100% to approximately 30% to 40% [19] [20] [21] , but further clinical trials remain essential to further improve mortality outcomes and develop treatments appropriate for LMICs.

The end date of recruitment was used to determine within which of these time periods the study would be categorised. In papers where the specific months of recruitment were not stated, the year of publication was used. Where data could not be extracted for individual sites within multicountry trials, these numbers were averaged. We compared the characteristics of trial participants (gender, relapse rate, ART status, and baseline Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)) to a composite reference of recently published observational and surveillance data from routine care settings [16, [23] [24] [25] [26] . ART experienced was defined as being on ART at the time of randomisation, including individuals who were on zidovudine monotherapy prior to the availability of combination ART. Chi-squared testing for trend was performed to describe trends in the demographics of trial participants and researchers over time. With regard to the gender, countries where researchers were born and where they resided during the trial, each study was categorised as either taking place in HICs or LMICs, and chi-squared calculations allowed comparison between these 2 groups. Statistical analysis was conducted in Stata/SE 15.0.",

            "text": "Our systematic review findings show that HIV-associated CM trials are generally conducted in locations reflecting the global burden of disease. There has been a marked shift from the USA to sub-Saharan Africa over the last 2 decades. CM trials are broadly representative of the patient population, but there is an underrepresentation of very sick patients with a low baseline GCS and those suffering with a relapse of CM. With the change in location from HICs to LMICs, there has been a significant trend for authors to be nonnationals of the country where research is performed, particularly in first and senior author positions. Female authors are generally underrepresented and, again, this is most marked in first and particularly senior author positions. CM remains a major public health problem, and it is reassuring that the number of trials being performed has remained steady throughout the HIV epidemic. The bulk of CM disease has likely always been in sub-Saharan Africa, and roughly 75% of all CM deaths currently occur in sub-Saharan Africa. As the number of cases of CM reduced in North America and Western Europe, there was a shift in focus to LMICs with a clear desire to identify simpler, less toxic, and more effective treatment regimens for CM. It is therefore appropriate that sub-Saharan Africa is now the epicentre of CM trials, recruiting 76% of all trial participants in the last decade. This is followed by the Asia and Pacific region where 22% of all CM deaths occur and 21% of participants were recruited. This demonstrates that the regional distribution of CM trials is now well matched to the epidemiology and likely mirrors a general increase in funding for global health [64] , including HIV research in LMICs [65] . The bulk of research has taken place in a small number of countries (particularly Malawi, South Africa, and Uganda). By studying Fig 2, which compares the number of participants recruited in different countries with data from the global disease burden estimates identifying the 12 countries globally with the largest number of annual cases in 2014, one can see areas with a high burden of disease that have not been involved in clinical trials such as Nigeria, Kenya, and Mozambique. Other countries, such as India for example, have a lot of CM cases but have only recruited a small number of participants into clinical trials. This uneven geographical spread is not unique to CM trials and is reflected in the global distribution of clinical trials more broadly. There are multiple, overlapping reasons for this which include the levels of internal and external funding made available to research and development in a specific country [66] ; access to partnerships with other research institutions; experience with clinical research (including having hosted previous CM trials); and the efficiency of the regulatory approval process in country [67] .",

Men are more likely to be diagnosed with advanced HIV disease, either due to delayed testing or nonadherence to ART and therefore more likely to develop CM. In routine care conditions, the proportion of CM patients who are female is roughly 40% [16, 23, 24, 68] , so although there is no gender parity, the most recent CM trials mirror the general patient population.",

            "text": "CM almost entirely occurs in individuals with very advanced HIV disease (CD4 <100 cells/ mm 3 ), and conception is quite rare in this population [69] . Pregnant and breastfeeding women are however most often excluded from CM trials due to a number of reasons. Often there is reluctance from ethics committees to include pregnant women in research studies, and sponsoring institutions may not be willing to take on the risk of litigation in the event of a poor outcome [70] . In addition, there are scientific concerns about antifungal toxicity, particularly with regard to fluconazole as there is weak evidence to suggest it is teratogenic at the high doses given for CM [71, 72] . One caveat to this is whereby trials include lactating women who voluntarily stop breastfeeding to participate in the trial and are supplied with formula milk by the research team. In routine care settings, pregnant and lactating women with CM often receive treatment with fluconazole, particularly where this is the only treatment available. The inclusion of pregnant and lactating women in clinical trials is a broad and urgent issue [2, 73, 74] , and there is reassuring evidence to suggest that this deficit is slowly being addressed in HIV-related clinical trials at least. Our research has identified that, out of 5,011 patients who were screened, only 12 were excluded due to pregnancy and 5 due to lactation, so this is not a large population that is being excluded. That does however not negate the need to build an evidence base to guide the management of pregnant and lactating women suffering from this potentially fatal infection. The most comprehensive collection of clinical data on CM in pregnancy is a case series from Uganda [75] . Teams across the globe should strongly consider collecting and combining observational data sets to build a deeper understanding of the safety profile of different treatment regimens and to collate maternal and neonatal outcomes. In addition, pregnant and lactating women should be considered for inclusion in future trials.",

These concerns proved to be unfounded, and there has been no difference in outcome observed between these groups [19] .

The 2 largest CM trials conducted in recent years excluded 8% to 9% of all patients screened due to relapse [19, 62] , and recent published data from routine care settings have shown relapse to occur in roughly 10% of cases [16, 23, 25, 26] .

We have learned that it is rare for participants to withdraw their consent (1%) or be lost to follow-up (2%). This likely reflects the fact that CM is a life-threatening condition and clinical trials often provide promising therapies or, particularly in LMICs, a standard of care that is superior to the routine care available. There is extensive literature to demonstrate that individuals with CM who enrol in a clinical trial have a better outcome, regardless of treatment arm [23, 76] . The reasons for this include having a dedicated clinical research team who have more time to care for patients, better monitoring and correction of drug-induced toxicities, and aggressive management of raised intracranial pressure, a common and potentially fatal complication of CM. These quantitative data do not however determine the impact of structural coercion into these trials, nor does it draw on any lived experience of trial participants. This is the focus of our research team who have embedded an ethnographic study into the ongoing AMBIsome Therapy Induction OptimisatioN (AMBITION) study [77] .",

We found that, over time, there was a significant trend of named authors being decreasingly a resident or national of a research site. This finding mirrors the increase in research conducted in LMICs through TRPs and is supported by the significant difference in these 2 domains when comparing trials conducted in HICs and LMICs. This is consistent with broader reviews of global health research in Africa in general which has found that indigenous researchers are frequently \"stuck in the middle\" [3, 15] . For example, Hedt-Gauthier and colleagues found that among general health-related studies published between 2014 and 2016, just 54% of authors were from the country of the paper's focus and this was 52.9% among the first author. Overall, in this study, we found this to be 70% and 59%, respectively, which is marginally better. There is no doubt that our discipline needs to work much harder to address this inequality, and we acknowledge the authorship of this paper itself lacks the diversity we aspire to. An in-depth discussion is beyond the scope of this article, and we encourage readers to access and actively engage with the growing body of literature on this topic, including discussions on the role of researchers from HICs when it comes to decolonising global health [78] [79] [80] [81] .",

Of all named authors, 29% were female, but a lower proportion were first (26%) and final (13%) author. Although there was no significant change over time, women were better (but still under) represented as authors of trials conducted in LMICs, and as the majority of trials are currently conducted in LMICs, there may be an increase over time. There were however no female authors from LMICs who were listed as the first or final author in the last decade. This finding is consistent with numerous other studies that have found female researchers to be underrepresented in clinical trials and more likely to occupy the middle section of the authorship list [82, 83] . This may be partially due to the fact that, in Africa for example, 72% of all physicians are male [84] , and in patriarchal societies, female physicians may have competing demands with regard to childcare and family responsibilities [67] . There is an urgent need to ensure female researchers are given the opportunity to gain research experience, be appointed to and supported within senior research roles, and ultimately become eligible for more of the prestigious authorship positions. The Global Health 50/50 initiative provides extensive guidance for individuals and institutions to address gender inequality in the workplace [85] . This is the first systematic review that has described the characteristics of participants in CM interventional trials over time and made a comparison with the general population who develop the disease. There are several limitations to this study. We only included clinical trials in this review, and we acknowledge that clinical trials are not the only useful source of data. There has been a large body of observational work conducted that has informed CM policy which was not included in this review. Observational study participants are more likely to resemble the overall population affected, and, given less stringent requirements in terms of conduct and monitoring, the authors and funders are likely more representative of study locations. There is an urgent need and opportunity with electronic systems to streamline and simplify data collection and monitoring for randomised studies, so that smaller institutions (especially at primary and secondary level) and local investigators are not, in effect, excluded from participation. In addition, there were rare instances where, despite additional efforts, it was not possible to extract data for all variables from published papers. In particular, the earlier studies did not consistently present full screening information. This resulted in some studies being excluded from specific aspects of the analysis which may have led to an inaccurate overall picture. This work was motivated by the pursuit of equity in global health research. Although broad reviews and commentaries have highlighted concerns regarding representation and inclusion, it is important to acknowledge that each individual disease tends to have its own tight-knit research community and that there may be considerable heterogeneity between groups. We have presented a comprehensive but simple methodology to describe trends in the representation and inclusion of patients and researchers over time. This methodology can be used to help focus our future efforts as we strive for equity. In addition, we now have the foundation of what can be an ongoing monitoring exercise to map our progress over the coming years. We believe that this methodology could be simply adopted and adapted by other research groups.",
