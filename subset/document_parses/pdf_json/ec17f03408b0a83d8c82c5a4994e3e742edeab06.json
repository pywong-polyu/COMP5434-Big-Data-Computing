            "text": "This cross-sectional observational study was conducted using the Symphony Health dataset (PRA Health Sciences, Raleigh, NC, USA) from the COVID-19 Research Database 13 . The COVID-19 Research Database was established with Institutional Review Board approval and an exemption from patient consent because it included only data considered to be de-identified by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), HIPAA-limited data, or non-HIPAA-covered data, along with the strong governance measures in place to control access to all data. The Symphony Health dataset was derived from pharmacy and medical claims from several sources including Medicare, which covers about 280 million patients (almost all older adults), 1.8 million prescribers, and 16,000 health plans in the United States. We used data collected from July 1, 2019, to June 30, 2020, about older adults (age 65 years old or older). To identify incident COVID-19 cases, we excluded individuals who had received a COVID-19 diagnosis before January 15, 2020. We also excluded individuals who had received an influenza vaccination on or after January 1, 2020 for two reasons. First, it generally takes 14 days for the body to develop antibodies against influenza after vaccination, so we hypothesized that the effect of the influenza vaccination would begin 14 days after the vaccination 14 . Second, although our design is closer to a cross-sectional study, we used the 14-day window to strengthen the temporality between influenza vaccination and COVID-19 infection. All the exposure (that is, influenza vaccination) occurred before the outcome (that is, COVID-19 infection). Figure 1 shows the timeline of covariate assessment, receipt of influenza or other vaccine, and outcomes.",

The four types of vaccines that are recommended by the CDC and commonly administered to older adults were adjusted in Analysis 1 and served as comparators in Analysis 2 (that is, herpes zoster, pneumococcal pneumonia, tetanus, and hepatitis A). The influenza vaccines included in this study were mainly FLUZONE High-Dose (Sanofi Pasteur Inc.) and FLUAD (Seqirus USA Inc.), which accounted for 56% and 29% of the study sample, respectively. These were the two vaccines that were recommended for older adults by the CDC. The use of other influenza vaccines was less than 5%. Both vaccines were trivalent in the study period; FLUZONE High-Dose is a vaccine without an adjuvant; FLAUD contains an adjuvant. Thus, we did not control the vaccine valency; instead, we adjusted the appearance of the adjuvant in multivariate analyses because a vaccine adjuvant may reduce COVID-19 severity 17 . Comorbidities were selected according to the CDC's warning about at-risk populations, including asthma, chronic kidney disease with dialysis, chronic lung disease, diabetes mellitus, hemoglobin disorders, immunocompromised, liver disease, serious heart conditions, and severe obesity (Table S1) 18 .",

Vaccines that are recommended for older adults were selected as the comparator (herpes zoster, pneumococcal pneumonia, tetanus, and hepatitis A). The risk of COVID-19 infection and severe COVID-19 illness were evaluated with univariate and multivariate logistic regressions. To compare the influenza-vaccination group with the no-influenza-vaccination group, we divided the study cohort into 2000 subcohorts because computing efficiency limited the processing of such a large amount of data at once. We calculated the odds ratio in each subcohort and used a meta-analysis approach to get the pooled results. The final result was pooled using a random-effects model. Data were managed using the Snowflake\u00ae data warehouse (Snowflake Inc., San Mateo, CA, USA), and the analyses were performed using SAS\u00ae version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA).",

            "text": "Although receiving an influenza vaccination was associated with a significant reduction in the risk of COVID-19 infection compared to not receiving an influenza vaccination, this effect may come from the healthy vaccine effect because people who were vaccinated may be healthier in general than those who were not vaccinated 19 . In addition, individuals who were vaccinated often have other health behaviors that may prevent the transmission of COVID-19 or reduce the severity of COVID-19 illness. The healthy vaccine effect may be reflected by the www.nature.com/scientificreports/ result that only a marginal effect was found when we compared the risk of COVID-19 infection between those who received an influenza vaccine and those who received a vaccine against something other than influenza; no difference in the risk of severe COVID-19 illness was observed between the influenza-vaccination group and the no-influenza-vaccination group. On the other hand, the marginal protective effects of influenza vaccination may be underestimated in this analysis as vaccination may increase individuals' immunity against diseases in general 20 . Despite the positive findings, a few studies have reported a null association between influenza vaccination and risk of COVID-19 infection [21] [22] [23] . These studies defined COVID-19 infection by laboratory-confirmed cases instead of assessing clinical outcomes after infection; two of them evaluated the effects among healthcare workers, and none of them reported the results for individuals aged \u2265 65. Because healthcare workers and younger adults generally have better immunity, influenza vaccination may provide insignificant benefit effect against COVID-19 infection in these populations. Among individuals aged \u2265 65, influenza vaccination is associated with a slightly lower probability of COVID-19 infection as well as lower odds of hospitalization and death 4,24 . Study limitation. In this study, we selected four other vaccines that are recommended by the CDC to the older adults as comparators to avoid the healthy vaccine effect. However, vaccines against diseases other than influenza are only administered once in a lifetime or at an interval of many years in between vaccinations. In the present study, only older adults who had received a vaccination after July 2019 could be traced. Therefore, a potential misclassification of this covariate may exist. The results of the comparison between the influenzavaccination group and the non-influenza-vaccination group should be conservative because individuals were required to have received at least one non-influenza vaccination to be included in the comparison group.",

Given that COVID-19 has been newly detected this year, it violates the bidirectional assumption. In short, it is impossible to identify an outcome event (that is, a COVID-19 case) before the exposure (that is, an influenza vaccination) because COVID-19 was not identified before 2020.",
