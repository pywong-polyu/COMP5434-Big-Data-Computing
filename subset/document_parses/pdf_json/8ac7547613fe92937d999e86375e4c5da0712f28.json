For example, several recent publications showed that NSP1 binds to the mRNA entry site on the host ribosomal RNA to inhibit host translation [5] [6] [7] . SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein interactome comprises many host RNA processing machinery proteins and stress granule proteins 1 , suggesting a potential role in interfering with host RNA processing and driving stress granule formation 8, 9 . One study showed that SARS-CoV-2 proteins bind to ~140 host transcripts 10 .

Infected cells were subject to UV irradiation, which covalently crosslinked interacting proteins to RNAs. This was followed by immunoprecipitation of non-structural proteins NSP8 and NSP12, which form part of the replication transcription complex (RTC), and N (nucleocapsid), using protein-specific antibodies to isolate the bound RNA. The RNA-bound proteins were resolved via SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes such that only the region spanning the expected protein size and 75 kDa larger were excised and purified in subsequent steps. The same size region of a non-immunoprecipitated input whole cell lysate was included as size-matched input to identify and remove non-specific, enriched sequences. Fig. 1a) . The near complete coverage implies that 6 most of the viral RNA interacts with RNA binding proteins. Two biological replicates were performed for each protein, and read densities show strong replicate agreement in all samples (Pearson's coefficient \u22650.87; Supplementary Fig. 1b) . Input-normalized IP read densities also display strong replicate correlation (Pearson's coefficient \u22650.88; Supplementary Fig. 1c) .",

We observed strong relative positional enrichment in NSP8 and NSP12 eCLIP read density at the 5\u2032 end, at 573-fold and 103-fold at position 1 respectively, but only 0.75-fold for N ( Supplementary Fig. 1e-f ). High relative positional enrichment is also observed for the region before position 66, which marks the start of the leader transcription regulatory site (TRS), with >22-fold for NSP12, >4.9-fold for NSP8, and only >0. 6- Fig. 1f ). NSP12 and NSP8 continued to be strongly enriched again after the S2M region at position 29,809 4 . The lack of enrichment at the S2M structure may suggest that its function is unrelated to recruiting replicase proteins NSP12 and NSP8. Our eCLIP findings thus provide a map of the direct interaction between replicase proteins NSP8 and NSP12 with regions in the UTRs likely involved in regulating replication and transcription 15 . 7 We observed that only a small fraction of reads mapped to the negative sense strand in the input samples (0.00075 for N, 0.00076 for NSP12, 0.0043 for NSP8) and the IP samples for N (0.00046). In contrast, NSP12 and NSP8 IP samples enriched the fraction of negative sense reads to 0.067 and 0.039, about 100-and 10-fold from IN samples, respectively ( Supplementary   Fig. 2a) . The negative sense strand coverage in IP samples was also lower in N (33%) than in NSP12 (80%) or NSP8 (58%) (Supplementary Fig. 2b ). NSP12 and NSP8 IP reads are piled up in the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 regions on the negative sense strand (Supplementary Fig. 2c) , which is similar to the positive sense strand. The low fraction of reads in the input samples prevents further quantitative assessments. Nevertheless, the findings confirm the roles for NSP12 and NSP8, but not N, in transcribing negative sense RNA templates to generate mRNAs for translation, and the ability for N to selectively associate with positive sense genomic RNA over negative sense RNAs.",

A closer inspection shows these stem-loop structures to have long, stable stems (Supplementary Fig. 3a) . As no strong sequence motifs were observed, we hypothesized that structural elements in the SARS-CoV-2 genome likely facilitate protein-8 RNA interactions with NSP12. Recently, it was shown via RNA footprinting with SHAPE structure probing experiments that in addition to RNA-RNA base pairing, some nucleotides with low SHAPE reactivity may be due to direct hydrogen bond interactions with RNA binding proteins 16 . For NSP12 and NSP8, we further observe a slight negative correlation between log2 fold change in eCLIP read density and SHAPE entropy 16 , where the latter correlates inversely with structuredness. Our eCLIP findings can thus add a layer of functional informationinteraction with NSP12 -to structural elements in SARS-CoV-2.",

Therefore, we investigated the extent to which NSP8, NSP12 and N interacted with host RNAs. Targeted transcripts were determined by having one or more peaks that meet the stringent IDR (irreproducible discovery rate 12 ) threshold of overlapping peaks between two replicates for every protein, and satisfy statistical cutoffs of p<0.001, and more than 8-fold enrichment in the immunoprecipitated sample (IP) over the size-matched input sample. We found that NSP8, NSP12 and N interact with 457, 703 and 24 genes with 658, 1457 and 39 significant peaks, respectively (Fig. 2a) . Interestingly, the number of RNA reads in Transcripts Per Kilobase Million (TPM) from both NSP8 and NSP12 immunoprecipitation (IP) samples were mapped more frequently to host transcripts than viral RNA (Fig. 2b) . Among the target genes, NSP12 and NSP8 shared 128 genes in common (18% of NSP12 targets, 26% of NSP8 targets), implying that NSP12 and NSP8 may interact with different host genes in both their individual and complexed states. In contrast, a majority of N immunoprecipitated RNA reads were mapped to viral RNA, consistent with its role in enclosing the viral genome during virion assembly 22 . The large number of peaks (2137 total) that map to the 1058 host genes further suggests a potential in perturbing host gene expression that may be required for viral replication.",

Of the genes regulating cell proliferation, cell cycle and apoptosis, PAK2 has been associated with anti-apoptotic signaling and promoting HIV survival 23 , whereas many other genes have overlapping annotation as the transcription regulation genes. A recent study elucidated global phosphorylation changes in cellular proteins upon SARS-CoV-2 infection 24 . Specifically, the p38/MAPK cascade activity is induced by viral 11 infection, and treatment with p38 inhibitors has restrictive effects on viral proliferation.In our NSP12 eCLIP data, we also saw enrichment of the MAPK cascade and other signaling pathway genes (e.g. MAPK1, MAP2K1/3, MAP4K4/5, PIM3, PAK2, EPHA2).In the context of the whole virus infection where a multitude of viral proteins and host defense responses are at play, we cannot definitively conclude that the interactions between NSP12 and these mRNAs have a causative or inhibitive relationship. Nevertheless, the correlation of NSP12 protein-RNA interactions with these pathway genes, which are relevant to viral infection and host response, leads us to hypothesize a potential, albeit unknown, role, and our data represents a rich resource for subsequent mechanism studies. To understand the individual contribution of viral proteinhost RNA interactions, we proceeded to profile the protein-RNA interactions of each SARS-CoV-2 protein. were found to target the greatest number of unique genes at 1339, 1647, 1199, 902, 863, and 865, respectively (Fig. 2b) .

To evaluate the functional role of the specific protein-RNA interactions of SARS-CoV-2 proteins and target transcripts, we characterized 14 of the proteins with the highest number of unique target coding genes using our recently published tethered function reporter assays 32 (Fig. 4c) . We fused individual proteins with an MS2 phage coat protein (MCP), which localizes the tagged protein to MS2 aptamer hairpins inserted in the 3\u2032 UTR of Renilla luciferase. A firefly luciferase without MS2 hairpins is included as a control for non-specific From our tethering experiments, we found that the ratio of Renilla-MS2 to firefly luciferase for 9 of the 14 SARS-CoV-2 proteins increase 1.9 (NSP6) to 3.5-fold (ORF9c) relative to FLAG-MCP control (p-value < 0.002, two tailed multiple t-test) (Fig. 4d) . Interestingly, these SARS-CoV-2 proteins raise the target luciferase activity to greater extent than the tethering of BOLL (1.5-fold), which is a human RBP previously characterized to be amongst the strongest up-regulators from a screen of more than 700 human RBPs 32 . Even though NSP1 eCLIP enriched very few host mRNAs and its peaks are not mapped to the 5\u2032 UTR and CDS, our results for NSP1 are consistent with its ability to enhance the translation of its own mRNA via interacting with the 5\u2032 UTR of the genomic viral mRNA 6 . Of the remaining 5 SARS-CoV-2 proteins, only NSP5, NSP16 and N display slight (but not significant) down-regulation effects (0.73-fold to 0.58-fold) compared to the FLAG peptide control, but to a lesser extent than that of the known translation repressor CNOT7 (0.16-fold). NSP7 and NSP9 appear to have no effect on the relative luciferase activity of the target Renilla reporter. To understand if the increase in luciferase activity is occurring at the RNA or protein level, we performed RT-qPCR to measure the ratio of Renilla-MS2 to Firefly mRNAs. For all the proteins except for NSP2, the Renilla-MS2/Firefly mRNA ratio is significantly increased (p<0.05) compared to wildtype, albeit to different extents for different proteins (Fig. 4e) . Of note, ORF9c shows the greatest enhancing effect (3.5-fold) in the dual luciferase assay, but its effect on the reporter RNAs is middling (1.5fold). However, ORF9c displays the greatest fold change in luciferase activity ratio to RNA ratio (2.3-fold) (Fig. 4f) , followed by NSP2 and ORF3b (1.6 and 1.7 fold respectively). The rest of the proteins range from 1.1-fold (NSP6) to 1.5-fold (NSP14), compared to 1.0-fold of BOLL, suggesting that the increase in abundance of the targeted reporter likely occurs at both the RNA and protein levels.",

Human lung organoids are a physiologically relevant system to study infections and have been shown to be highly infectible by SARS-CoV-2 34 . siRNAs were selected from the target mRNAs of SARS-CoV-2 proteins with mRNA stabilization or translation enhancing activities, in addition to an anti-ACE2 siRNA and a scrambled sequence as a negative control. We assayed for infected cells by immunofluorescence and determined infection rate by measuring the total integrated fluorescence intensity of the stained nucleocapsid protein. To control for cell viability, we divided the integrated intensity to the area stained by DAPI, and normalized the values to the scrambled control (Fig. 4l) . We found that siRNA knockdown of RPN1, UGGT1, NDUFA4, HSPA5, PSMD13, LAPTM4A, LAMP1, and LDHB significantly (p<0.05, two-tailed t-test) reduced infection rates for at least one of the tested SARS-CoV-2 variants compared to a scrambled siRNA control (Fig. 4l) .

However, since the cell lines used for ENCODE -HepG2 and K562 -and in this study -BEAS-2B -are different, the Jaccard indexes are low, at 0.050 for NSP7, 0.054 for NSP9, 0.057 for NSP5, and 0.074 for NSP2. To further ascertain similarity with U2AF2 protein-RNA interactions, we inspected the positional read density. The 5\u2032 end of each eCLIP read can be used to approximate the crosslink site where reverse transcription is aborted or truncated when converting protein-bound RNA to cDNA. By taking the mean of the 5\u2032 read truncation density across all target genes, we observe a strong enrichment for the truncation site at a median of 11 nt upstream of the 3\u2032 splice site ( Fig. 5c;   Supplementary Fig. 9c) .

We observed no difference in log2 fold changes of mRNA levels in NSP9 overexpressing cells versus wildtype cells between NSP9 eCLIP targets and non-targets, which agrees with the observation of lack of perturbation of target gene expression in the dual reporter assay. However, NSP9 eCLIP targets displayed greater log2 fold change of mRNA levels in the nuclear fraction and lower levels in the cytosolic fraction than non-target genes (Fig. 5e) . To validate the sequencing results, we performed individual RT-qPCR on the subcellular fractionated RNAs for individual target mRNAs IL-1\u03b1, ANXA2 and UPP1 (Fig. 5f) , and observed lower cytosolic to total mRNA ratios in NSP9-expressing versus parental cells, whereas the cytosolic mRNA levels of non-targeted controls MALAT1 and UBC were not significantly lowered (Fig. 5g) .

Interferon \u03b1, \u03b2 and \u03b3 resulted in lowered IL-1\u03b1 levels in NSP9 cells compared to wild type, though tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF\u03b1) resulted in the greatest reduction (~ 30%) (Fig. 5h) .

First, we performed eCLIP on NSP8, NSP12 and N proteins in SARS-CoV-2 infected Vero E6 cells and identified both host and viral RNAs bound by these proteins. We found that NSP12 and NSP8 bound specifically to the 5\u2032 UTR and 3\u2032 UTR of the virus genome, signaling their role in genome replication, whereas N bound nonspecifically to the 23 entire region of the virus genome. We also found that NSP12 and NSP8 strongly enriched regions upstream of leader transcription regulatory site and the negative sense strand of the virus genome, providing further evidence of their involvement, but not N's, in generating mRNAs from negative sense RNAs. Several major peaks are found across the genome that overlap highly structured regions. A distinctly strong peak near the 3\u2032 end of NSP3 on the positive sense strand was identified from the NSP12 eCLIP. NSP12 may be involved in RNA polymerase transcriptional stalling and recombination with co-infected viruses in the evolutionary history of SARS-CoV-2. Of the host proteins recently identified to interact with NSP12 1 , SLU7 is the only splicing regulator 38 , which may be recruited by NSP12 for virus genome splicing. However, without further evidence, the functional significance and mechanism of NSP12 binding to region 7436-7526 are unknown and await future investigations. As some of the protein-RNA interaction peaks appear highly conserved and structured, these RNA sequences could serve as potential targets for broadly neutralizing antiviral drugs such as RNA-targeting small molecules 39 to protect against future coronavirus outbreaks.",

Our eCLIP and RIC findings indicate no direct interaction between NSP1 and cellular mRNAs. This may imply that global mRNA degradation is not facilitated by NSP1 interaction with host mRNAs, though transient nucleolytic events may not be captured by UV crosslinking and subsequent RNA preparation for sequencing. Finally, we demonstrated by overexpression studies that NSP12 has enhancing effects on the RNA levels of endogenous target genes, while ORF9c displayed translation enhancing effects. We then showed that siRNA knockdown of host genes targeted by SARS-CoV-2 proteins with gene expression enhancing effects restricted viral infection or proliferation. Thus, we presented a potential for viral protein-host RNA interactions in upregulating host genes that are required for viral propagation.",

            "text": "We also found that NSP9 significantly interacts with >900 transcripts and, together with its association with the nuclear pore complex, inhibits mRNA export of its target RNAs. We further demonstrated that NSP9 inhibits mRNA export of the IL-1\u03b1/\u03b2 cytokine and reduces its production. Our findings shed light on a direct RNA targeting mechanism that viral proteins may employ to disrupt host mRNA nucleocytoplasmic transport. Recently, NSP1 was shown to interact with NXF1 to prevent its binding with mRNA export factors 46 . Since cytosolic mRNA levels are depleted, the increase in intronic reads was found to be more likely driven by mRNA degradation and/or mRNA export inhibition than alternative splicing as a result of viral infection 43 . Thus, our results contribute further evidence that SARS-CoV-2 proteins could leverage nuclear mRNA export inhibition as a strategy to dampen host antiviral response [46] [47] [48] . Fig. 5b) . However, it is unclear why we observe such a dramatic increase in peaks identified with eCLIP versus Halotag-CLIP. It is possible that their assay conditions were overly stringent, as GAPDH, which was used as a negative control, is extensively annotated as an RNA binding protein 49 expressing BEAS-2B cells, 48h after induction by 0 or 100 ng/ml TNF\u03b1 (mean \u00b1 s.e.m, n = 3 biologically independent replicates, *p<0.05, **p<0.005, two-tailed t-test).",

Our eCLIP results provide the first genome-wide map of RNA interactions with viral proteins during an authentic SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Due to the lack of antibodies specific for most of the viral proteins, the individual proteins were exogenously expressed in a lung epithelial cell line BEAS-2B, which is an immortalized primary bronchial cell line representative of normal lung physiology. Each protein was either fused with a 2xStrep tag and expressed stably via lentiviral transduction or fused with a 3xFLAG tag and expressed transiently via transfection. Following UV crosslinking, the tagged proteins were immunoprecipitated using anti-FLAG or anti-Strep antibodies. Subsequent RNA purification and library purification steps were performed as in the viral eCLIP experiments. Cells expressing only the 3xFLAG or 2xStrep tags and wildtype cells are used as controls to remove background peaks in subsequent analysis steps.

Nevertheless, we applied stringent filtering to further remove potential background peaks: viral protein eCLIP peaks were filtered by eCLIP peaks found in the wild-type BEAS-2B cells and cells overexpressing only the 3xFLAG and 2xStrep peptides, where anti-FLAG and anti-Strep antibodies were used in the immunoprecipitation step. It is also possible that the large (~33 kDa) size of the N-terminal HaloTag inhibits some interactions or proper localization of viral proteins that are better captured with the smaller (~2.7 kDa) FLAG and (~2.9 kDa) Strep tags. Finally, without extensive engineering of the SARS-CoV-2 genome, antibody-based immunoprecipitation was the only viable way of studying viral protein-RNA in a whole virus infection context.Like many viruses, the host-viral interactions underlying SARS-CoV-2 infection isbroadly understood in terms of the virus hijacking the host cell by globally shutting down the expression of host genes that are irrelevant or hostile to its replication 51 , while the host attempts to fight off the virus by mounting apoptotic and inflammatory responses. To add to this understanding, we propose that viral proteins interact with host RNAs to activate a subset of host genes for its own survival through targeted translation activation or mRNA stabilization. We show that NSP12 and ORF9c specifically upregulate genes in the processes of protein N-linked glycosylation, mitochondrial ATP synthesis and transport, and COPII vesicle formation. We also27 propose that NSP9 contributes another layer to dampening host gene expression by inhibiting mRNA export. Understanding specifically upregulated processes and pro-viral genes will enable the development of new antiviral strategies. Our extensive and comprehensive dataset of SARS-CoV-2 protein-host RNA interactions provide a rich resource for understanding host-virus interactions and to enable development of new therapeutic strategies for acute COVID-19 and potential future coronavirus pandemics.",

Metagene mapping analyses 46 Metagene plots were created using the intersection of eCLIP peaks and a set of mRNA regions. To generate the list of each CDS, 5\u02b9 UTR and 3\u02b9 UTR, non-overlapping gene annotations from GENCODE v19 were used. First, low-expression transcripts (TPM < 1) from BEAS-2B cells were removed. Then, transcripts with the highest TPM were selected, resulting in a single transcript per gene in the CDS. For each 5\u02b9 UTR, CDS and 3\u02b9 UTR in a gene, the entire set of exons making up the region was concatenated and overlapped with eCLIP peaks, resulting in a vector of positions across the transcript containing values of 1 if a peak was found at a given position or 0 otherwise. Plotted lines represent the number of total peaks found at each position divided by the total number of unique transcripts. The length of each region within the metagene was then scaled to 8%, 62% and 30%, corresponding to the average length of regions from the most highly expressed transcripts in ENCODE HepG2 RNA-seq control datasets.

Then, the total subtracted signal was normalized with the total subtracted signal on the pre-mRNA transcript. Interval features such as introns and exons were extracted from the Gencode v19 coordinates. Since each region interval can have different lengths for different transcripts, two windows slicing from the 5\u02b9 end or the 3\u02b9 end were created, up to a length of 150 bases. No scaling was applied for this metagene visualization. Finally, the density in each feature was normalized across all IDR peak-containing transcripts, creating the average metagene density map. The density signal was smoothed using gaussian kernel density with sigma = 5 bases. To call alternative splicing (AS) events from deeply sequenced RNA-seq data, we used rMATs 3.2.5 with gencode v19 annotations.Significant AS events are defined with the threshold FDR < 0.1, inclusion level difference >MS2-tethering dual luciferase assayThe Renilla-MS2 and Firefly reporter constructs were taken from a previously reported MS2tethering dual luciferase assay 32 .

Mean Ct values were calculated from each triplicate set for each biological replicate. Biological replicates were averaged to generate mean fold changes, and values expressed as fold differences to control samples were calculated using the \u0394\u0394Ct method.For each co-IP sample, one confluent 10 cm dish of cells was used. Cells were washed with PBS, scraped, and centrifuged at 200 g for 5 min to pellet. Cell pellets were snap frozen for storage at -80\u00baC until use. Dynabead M-280 Sheep Anti-Mouse IgG (Invitrogen) magnetic beads were washed three times using TBS+0.05% Tween-20 (TBST) before incubating with 5 \u00b5g anti-Strep antibody (ref antibody list) for 45 min with rotation at room temperature. Cell pellets were resuspended and lysed in 500 \u00b5l of gentle, non-denaturing lysis buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 137 mM NaCl, 1% NP-40 (Igepal), 2 mM EDTA, Protease Inhibitor Cocktail Set III (EMD Millipore)) on ice for 30 min. After cell lysis, lysates were centrifuged at 20,000 g at 4\u00baC for 10 min. Antibody bound beads were washed three times with TBST before resuspending in 100 \u00b5l of the gentle lysis buffer. The remaining of the cleared lysate was added to the resuspended beads and incubated overnight at 4\u00baC with rotation. After overnight incubation, About 20 \u00b5l or 4% of the cleared lysate was set aside as the INPUT sample to check for antibody integrity and protein expression. The remaining IP samples were washed in chilled lysis buffer three times, before resuspending in 60 \u00b5l lysis buffer. INPUT and IP samples were carried forward to Western blotting. Cells were washed with PBS and lysed in lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, 100 mM NaCl, 1% NP-40, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate; pH 7.4) with Protease Inhibitor Cocktail Set III (EMD Millipore).
