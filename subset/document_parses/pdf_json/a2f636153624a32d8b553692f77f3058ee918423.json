During the COVID-19 outbreak, experts have noted both a lack of law where it is needed and a problematic use of laws that exist. To address those challenges, policymakers revising public health emergency laws can examine how existing laws were used during the COVID-19 response to address problems that arose during their application. Judicial opinions can provide a source of data for this review. This study used legal epidemiology methods to perform an environmental scan of global judicial opinions, published from March 1 through August 31, 2020, from 23 countries, related to government-issued COVID-19 mitigation measures. The opinions were coded, and findings categorize the measures based on: (1) the World Health Organization's May 2020 publication, Overview of Public Health and Social Measures in the Context of COVID-19, and (2) related legal challenges brought in courts, including disputes about authority; conflicts of law; rationality, proportionality, or necessity; implementation; and enforcement. The findings demonstrate how judicial review of emergency measures has played a role in the COVID-19 response. In some cases, court rulings required mitigation measures to be amended or stopped. In others, court rulings required the government to issue a measure not yet in place. These findings provide examples for understanding issues related to the application of law during an emergency response.",

            "text": "U pon the signing of International Health Regulations (IHR) 2005, 1 participating countries agreed to strengthen the capacity to respond to public health emergencies worldwide. Laws play an important role in emergency response capacity and in IHR compliance. During the COVID-19 outbreak, experts have noted both a lack of law where it is needed and a problematic use of laws that exist. 2, 3 The World Health Organization (WHO) recommended a review of legal frameworks for the tools necessary to respond to future outbreaks. 2 Judicial opinions provide important context and guidance for discussions during a review of existing laws. Policymakers reviewing legal frameworks and revising public health emergency laws can examine how existing laws were used during the COVID-19 response to address problems that arose during their application. Judicial opinions can provide a source of data for this review. 4, 5 Policymakers can use this research to better prepare for the legal disputes that might arise when issuing particular types of mitigation measures for future responses such as those identified by WHO for responding to COVID-19. 6 Judicial opinions can also serve as a source of data for gaining a more complete picture of how mitigation measures impact the course of an outbreak. During disease outbreaks, public health practitioners study how executive and legislative bodies issued mitigation measures in order to understand how the mitigation measure impacted the course of the outbreaks. In addition to understanding the laws put in place by executive or legislative bodies, public health law practitioners can also gain insight from an understanding of how laws change after judicial review of a legal challenge to those measures. For example, judicial opinions may include orders to stop mitigation measures that have been put in place by other government actors. 7 The operation of the judiciary has been impacted significantly by the pandemic. 8 However, in this study we were able to collect and review judicial opinions issued from March 1 through August 31, 2020, in response to COVID-19 by constitutional courts and courts with jurisdiction over emergency law review. Through this and similar studies, researchers studying the impact of mitigation measure may then understand the role of the judiciary in legal preparedness. That understanding is important to making sure data are complete when determining how the mitigation measures impacted the disease outbreak.",

The second category includes arguments that the mitigation measure conflicts with other existing local, national, or international laws, including laws setting forth constitutional or international procedures and requirements. Many judicial opinions contained disputes about the relationship between the mitigation measures and the status of the emergency; thus, the third category attempts to capture those issues using 3 keywords that may be found in international standards and national standards of review: rational, proportional, and necessary. The fourth category addresses questions about whether there is a right at issue in the dispute. Rights may be those set out in international law, national law, or those claimed by the party initiating the dispute. Our coders looked for the words ''rights'' or ''freedom'' or ''liberty'' when determining whether a right was at issue and did not use any secondary sources to verify whether the right had been codified. The fifth category is a broad category that collects information about disputes involving the duty to issue mitigation measures, the accountability for issuing lawful mitigation measures, and how mitigation measures were being carried out. The sixth category addresses enforcement issues that public health practitioners and policymakers faced during the COVID-19 response, as they attempted to find effective means of ensuring public compliance with mitigation measures while making sure those enforcement mechanisms did not exacerbate the emergency or put law enforcement at unnecessary risk.",

The court required an exception clause in the measure for case-by-case determination on allowance of religious events. In Calvary Chapel Dayton Valley v Steve Sisolak and South Bay United Pentecostal Church et al v Newsom of the United States, religious organizations challenged state-imposed mitigation orders that limited the number of people who could attend religious services. 76, 77 The churches argued that the state orders discriminated against houses of worship and violated the constitutionally protected freedom of religion.

The court found that the regulations were not ''reasonably justifiable for the purpose of dealing with the situation which has given rise to the emergency'' because they did not ''deal with'' the coronavirus. The court pointed out that, regardless of how laudable they were, the legality ''is measured by enquiring whether they are authorised by the Article of the Constitution.'' 5 In The Queen (on application of Ahmed Adiatu and Another) v Her Majesty's Treasury of the United Kingdom, a private hire driver and the Independent Workers' Union of Great Britain challenged decisions to provide aid only to select workers, arguing that the decisions were in conflict with other laws, ''discriminatory contrary to the European Convention on Human Rights [.] EU law, and/or were taken in breach of the public sector equality duty.'' 75 The High Court of Justice found ''the Defendant had sufficient regard to equalities issues'' when making its economic aid decisions and dismissed the applicants' complaint. 75 ",

            "text": "In 31 judicial opinions reviewed, the court rulings stopped, amended, or invalidated a mitigation measure already in place, even if only temporarily, during the emergency response. The public health impact of those changes could vary significantly; a determination of that impact is outside the scope of this study and should be explored through further analysis. However, a comparison of 3 judicial opinions in different countries about disputes to stay-at-home measures illustrates the differences in how judicial opinions could impact emergency management planning and response work. For example, on August 19, 2020, New Zealand's High Court ruled in Borrowdale v Director-General of Health that a stay-at-home measure had been invalid for a 9-day period. 56 In contrast, Kosovo's Supreme Court ruled in case KO54 of 2020 on March 31 that a stay-at-home measure, issued on March 23, 2020, was invalid effective as of April 13. 61 In further contrast, Malawi's Supreme Court issued Kathumba and Others v The President of Malawi and Others and stopped a national lockdown the day before it was to be put in place. 53 The findings presented here also demonstrate the role of the judiciary in amending mitigation measures and putting measures in place where none existed. Of the 39 judicial opinions that contained at least 1 ruling requiring a change to a mitigation measure, 8 required an amendment to a measure or required a measure to be put in place. In some cases, a court's review required amendments to public health mitigation measures or additional mitigation measures be put in place to aid public health, prevent violations of law, or comply with public health guidance. For example, Guatemala's Expediente 1768-2020 required provision of personal protective equipment to healthcare workers, 39 while Shashank Deo Sudhi v Union of India and Others required COVID-19 testing to be provided free of charge. 47 Scalabrini Centre of Cape Town and Another v Minister of Social Development and Others required amendments to mitigation measures to incorporate vulnerable populations such as asylum seekers, 73 and Law Society of Kenya v Hillary Mutyambai Inspector General National Police Service and Others (120/2020) expanded essential services and personnel lists during a lockdown to include professionals instrumental in protecting individual health and rights. 60 These findings illustrate the ways in which judicial review of mitigation measures may have strengthened a country's COVID-19 emergency response. National and local courts, acting to provide judicial review of the actions of other governmental entities within their jurisdictions, can provide an independent review of those actions and strengthen global accountability for public health laws and adherence to global public health guidelines (both nationally and internationally).",

For example, the Malawi High Court stopped a national lockdown the day before it was to become effective, and a court reviewing that decision noted an ''urgent need for Parliament to pass a new law on public health to be enacted that will comprehensively deal with the issues of pandemics,'' observing that ''the current Public Health Act is very old and ill-equipped to deal with a pandemic of the COVID-19 magnitude.'' 7 In State v The President of Malawi and Others ex parte Mponda, Soko, and Others, which concerned school closures, the High Court in Malawi also addressed the issue of reviewing public health emergency laws, comparing the legal framework under the Disaster Preparedness and Relief Act (DRPA) to how the constitution provides for states of emergencies, stating:",

In other words, what limits does section 32 of the DPRA circumscribe. This Court is therefore realizing there will be need for Malawi to have a comprehensive discussion on the important matter and distinctions of the law on state of disasters vis-a-vis states of emergency. 54 Modernization of public health laws requires an examination of additional protections and limitations on any expanded public health legal authority. Even where courts found that governments did have authority to issue mitigation measures, the mitigation measures issued may have conflicted with limitations on the authorities set out in other laws, including constitutions and international laws, or may have been used in manners that were not rational, proportional, or necessary to address the emergency. For example, in enacting a curfew order, the High Court of Kenya discussed that while the government had the authority to apply a curfew to a public health response, it was required to ensure the curfew was not in conflict with other laws, specifically, that it followed constitutional limitations on those kinds of authorities. 60 Thus, from these judicial opinions, we can learn a public health legal preparedness lesson that the law can have an impact on mitigation measures and that guidance for policymakers and public health practitioners should include training sessions and simulations to strengthen preparedness actions to include the use of public health authorities. Training and educational materials may also be used to prepare the judiciary for cases during public health emergencies. 4 Judicial opinions provide details on the types of measures where existing authority was not implemented, did not take rights into account, or was not used in a rational, proportional, or necessary manner. In those instances, exercises or simulations during nonemergency periods can help policymakers and public health leadership practice use of legal authorities and identify potential gaps or barriers, particularly where public health measures may conflict with the limitations set out in law. Yet, even where public health legal authorities exist, they may be used during an emergency in a manner that is not deemed rational, proportional, or necessary by legal standards, or they may conflict with other laws. Training and simulations can help policymakers and public health leaders practice incorporating public health guidanceinto mitigation measures while considering other requirements set out in law.",
