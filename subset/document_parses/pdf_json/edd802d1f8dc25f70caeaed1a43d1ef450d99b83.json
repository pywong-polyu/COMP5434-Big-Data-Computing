Except for the initial cases, most of these patients implemented self-quarantine after the outbreak, thus they did not infect other people, suggesting the importance of self-quarantine especially for those with high-risk exposures. In addition, Chinese authorities required residents to stay at home, avoiding outdoor activities. As a result, a considerable proportion of transmissions occurred between families or relatives; however, this broke the chain of infection transmission and therefore prevented the spread of COVID-19. On the contrary, outside activities, such as transmission in the shopping mall at Baodi district, led to complex cross transmission and a wider range of transmission. This is consistent with the findings from Kim et al. who found that transmission of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus was determined by the number of contacts (16) .

After infection, patients may show bilateral ground-glass opacity or consolidation on chest CT scans, along with common symptoms that include fever, dry cough, and shortness of breath, at the onset of illness (17) (18) (19) . In severe cases, dyspnea, respiratory distress syndrome, or septic shock may develop (18) . In this study, 19.1% of cases presented severe manifestations. We analyzed the risk factors for early severe infections in Tianjin. In a recently published study with a sample size of 72,314, the mortality rate for men was significantly higher than that for women (63.8 vs. 36.2%) (11) . Our study found that male was an independent risk factor for severe infection, suggesting the necessity of paying more attention to early intervention. We speculated on the causes of the association between male and severe COVID-19 infection. Males and females differ in their immunological responses to pathogens, and males generally show higher susceptibility, prevalence, and severity of infection than females, including respiratory tract infection (20) (21) (22) . Observed in mice infected with Mycoplasma pulmonis, the pulmonary parenchyma disease of male mice is always more serious than that of female mice (23) . On the other hand, smoking is generally more prevalent among men than women. Although no firm conclusions can be drawn about the association between smoking and severity of COVID-19 (24) , some evidence shows that active cigarette smoking and up-regulation of ACE-2 expression (an entry receptor of SARS-CoV-2) in lower airways may in part contribute to the increased risk of severe COVID-19 (25) . Further investigation is needed to confirm the association between male and severe COVID-19 infection and investigate the accurate mechanisms. The severe infection group had a higher proportion of patients with Wuhanrelated exposure, which, however, was not an independent risk factor. In fact, most of these patients were infected in the early stage of the epidemic, when the disease might be easily ignored or diagnosed delayed. Based on a previous study, patients treated in the intensive care unit (ICU) (n = 36), compared with patients not treated in the ICU (n = 102), were older (median age, 66 vs. 51 years) (26) . Also, another study showed that older age were associated with severe infection (27) .
