            "text": "The response by vaccine developers to the COVID-19 pandemic has been extraordinary with effective vaccines authorized for emergency use in the United States within 1 year of the appearance of the first COVID-19 cases. However, the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants and obstacles with the global rollout of new vaccines highlight the need for platforms that are amenable to rapid tuning and stable formulation to facilitate the logistics of vaccine delivery worldwide. We developed a \"designer nanoparticle\" platform using phage-like particles (PLPs) derived from bacteriophage lambda for a multivalent display of antigens in rigorously defined ratios. Here, we engineered PLPs that display the receptor-binding domain (RBD) protein from SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV, alone (RBD SARS -PLPs and RBD MERS -PLPs) and in combination (hCoV-RBD PLPs). Functionalized particles possess physiochemical properties compatible with pharmaceutical standards and retain antigenicity. Following primary immunization, BALB/c mice immunized with RBD SARS -or RBD MERS -PLPs display serum RBD-specific IgG endpoint and live virus neutralization titers that, in the case of SARS-CoV-2, were comparable to those detected in convalescent plasma from infected patients. Further, these antibody levels remain elevated up to 6 months post-prime. In dose-response studies, immunization with as little as one microgram of RBD SARS -PLPs elicited robust neutralizing antibody responses. Finally, animals immunized with RBD SARS -PLPs, RBD MERS -PLPs, and hCoV-RBD PLPs were protected against SARS-CoV-2 and/or MERS-CoV lung infection and disease. Collectively, these data suggest that the designer PLP system provides a platform for facile and rapid generation of single and multi-target vaccines.",

This betacoronavirus is related to two other coronaviruses that are highly pathogenic for humans-SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) 3 . Although SARS-CoV no longer circulates in the human population, SARS-CoV-2 infection is the cause of the global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID- 19) , which can progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and death 4 . The elderly, immunocompromised, and those with certain comorbidities (e.g., obesity, diabetes, and hypertension) are at the greatest risk of severe COVID-19 5 . Moreover, genetic variants of SARS-CoV-2 with distinct transmission and antigenic properties, including the Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, and Omicron variants of concern, have continuously emerged throughout the pandemic, challenging public health strategies and the efficacy of vaccines and other medical countermeasures [6] [7] [8] . In addition, MERS-CoV remains in circulation and has infected over 2,500 people with a lethal disease in~834 (~34% case fatality rate) 9 . The virus has spread to 28 countries since emerging in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in 2012 9, 10 , and large outbreaks of human-to-human transmission have occurred in Riyadh and Jeddah in 2014 and in South Korea in 2015 11, 12 .",

The 5\u2032 two-thirds encode nonstructural proteins that catalyze genome replication and viral RNA synthesis, whereas the 3\u2032 one-third of the genome encodes the viral structural proteins, including nucleoprotein and the spike (S), envelope, and membrane proteins. The S protein of coronaviruses forms homotrimeric spikes on the virion (Fig. 1a) , which engages cell surface attachment factors and entry receptors 14 . Protein cleavage occurs sequentially during the entry process to yield S1 and S2 fragments and is then followed by further processing of S2 to yield a smaller S2\u2032 protein 15 . The S1 fragment includes the receptorbinding domain (RBD), the predominant target of potently neutralizing monoclonal antibodies, while the S2 fragment promotes membrane fusion [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] .",

For instance, currently approved RNAbased vaccines that target the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 are safe and highly effective 28, 29 ; however, they suffer from multiple-dose requirements, require strict \"cold-chain\" conditions that limit vaccine distribution, and pose constraints on the infrastructure and healthcare system, and their use has been associated with mild myocarditis in some populations 30 . Conversely, adenovirus vector vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 can have the advantage of single-dose administration 31 , but they are less effective than RNA vaccines and can lead to serious side effects, such as labored breathing, transient neutropenia and lymphopenia, liver damage, and, in rare cases, neuropathies like Bell's palsy and transverse myelitis [32] [33] [34] . Furthermore, the success of platforms derived from eukaryotic viruses (e.g., adenoviruses) has been tempered by safety concerns related to pathogenicity, immunogenicity, and toxicity 35 . Thus, there continues to be a need for multifaceted, rapidly tunable vaccine platforms that can respond to novel emerging threats, including natural variants, that provide longterm protection, and that are amenable to industrial strategies to afford thermostable, single-shot formulations for efficient distribution in resource-limited settings.",

Co-expression of the major capsid and \"scaffolding\" proteins in Escherichia coli affords icosahedral PLP shells that can be isolated in high yield. These can then be decorated in vitro with the lambda decoration protein (gpD), which binds as trimer spikes to the 140 three-fold axes of the icosahedral shell (420 total copies; see Fig. 1b) 56, 57 . The decoration protein can be modified genetically to display heterologous peptides and proteins that can be similarly displayed on the PLP surface 46, 58, 59 . Additionally, we have engineered a mutant gpD protein that contains a Ser42->Cys Design and construction of hCoV-RBD decorated particles. a Atomistic model of the SARS-CoV-2 virion with homotrimeric spikes of the S protein shown in shades of pink. The image was generously provided by Nanographics GmbH (hello@nanographics.at). b Cryo-EM reconstruction of the phage lambda capsid with only the density from the trimeric spikes of the decoration protein, gpD, displayed, kindly provided by G. Lander. Shown to the right in the cartoon representation is the crystal structure of an isolated gpD trimer (PDB: 1C5E 99 ) modified to contain the serine to cysteine mutation (red spheres) of the gpD variant, gpD(S42C). c Reaction schematic for the chemical crosslinking of human coronavirus RBD proteins (hCoV-RBDs) to gpD(S42C) via lysine amide coupling and thiol-maleimide chemistry. The products (gpD-RBD SARS and gpD-RBD MERS ) contain a PEG crosslinker, SM(PEG) 24 , with a spacer arm length of 95.2 \u00c5. d PLPs are decorated with RBDs at the desired surface densities either independently (top) or in combination (bottom) with remaining gpD-binding sites filled using wildtype gpD such that all 420 binding sites are occupied. mutation (gpD(S42C)), which enables site-specific chemical modification of the decoration protein using maleimide chemistry (Fig. 1b) 46 . Employing our in vitro system, PLPs can be independently or simultaneously decorated with genetically and chemically modified decoration proteins in rigorously defined surface densities 46, 53 . While all phage and PLP platforms have strengths and weaknesses, the lambda PLP platform has several advantages and unique features that can be harnessed for vaccine development: (i) PLPs can be decorated under defined in vitro conditions with biological and synthetic molecules in varying surface densities, simultaneously integrating genetic and chemical modification strategies. This provides a robust and expansive set of integrated genetic and chemical modification tools; (ii) modification of the particle surface is facile, fast, and can be tuned in a user-defined manner, thereby streamlining the formulation process. These two features allow rigorous and controlled ligand display that is not limited by the requirement for phage replication; (iii) intact phage and PLP shells are natural adjuvants capable of stimulating the innate immune response 60, 61 ; and (iv) the ability to display antigens in high density can aid in regulating effector function 62 . Importantly, the decorated particles are monodisperse, stable, and possess physiochemical properties amenable for pharmaceutical formulation and as required to address regulatory hurdles 53, 63, 64 . Indeed, we have recently demonstrated that antigen-decorated PLPs formulated in glassy dry powders are stable at 50\u02daC for more than one month 65 . Therefore, the lambda system described here allows for substantial flexibility and rigorous control in vaccine design and development, setting the stage for the construction of an \"all-inone\" vaccine platform.",

Intramuscular administration of RBD SARS -PLPs, RBD MERS -PLPs, and hCoV-RBDs PLPs in mice induces robust and durable humoral immune responses, including the production of neutralizing antibodies.

These proteins were cross-linked to the lambda decoration protein mutant, gpD(S42C), following a twostep procedure. First, solvent-accessible lysine residues in the hCoV-RBDs were modified with the N-hydroxysuccinimide ester groups of the SM(PEG) 24 heterobifunctional crosslinker, as depicted in Fig. 1c ; SDS-PAGE analysis reveals an apparent single predominant product for both RBD SARS and RBD MERS (Fig. 2a , d, respectively, lanes 4). Next, the maleimide groups of the crosslinker were reacted with the sole cysteine residue of gpD (S42C) to afford the gpD-RBD SARS and gpD-RBD MERS constructs (Fig. 1c) ; SDS-PAGE analysis reveals multiple products in each case (Fig. 2a, d, lanes 5 ). The reaction mixtures were fractionated by size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) (Fig. 2b, e) , and the fraction containing a single predominant product for each hCoV-RBD was isolated and then concentrated for use in all subsequent experiments (fraction 32, Fig. 2c , f).",

For instance, 60% RBD SARS -PLPs denote particles that are decorated with 252 copies of gpD-RBD SARS with the remaining sites filled with wildtype (WT) gpD (168 copies). Similarly, 40% hCoV-RBD PLPs are particles that are decorated with 168 copies of gpD-RBD SARS , 168 copies of gpD-RBD MERS , and 84 copies of WT gpD.

Physiochemical characterization of PLP preparations by dynamic and electrophoretic light scattering analyses reveal that the mean hydrodynamic diameter of particles decorated with RBDs also increases as a function of RBD surface density and have an overall surface charge that ranges from \u221212 to \u221229 mV ( Table 1 ). The polydispersity index (PDI) of the decorated particles ranges from (0.156 \u00b1 0.05) to (0.285 \u00b1 0.09).

Compared to control mice, mice immunized with all doses (including 0.25 \u03bcg) of 60% RBD SARS PLPs were protected from weight loss associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection (Fig. 6c) . At 4 dpi, lungs were collected and assessed for viral burden. Immunization with 2.5 or 1.0 \u03bcg of 60% RBD SARS -PLPs resulted in potent protection against viral infection (Fig. 6d) and reduced levels of viral genomic and subgenomic RNA (Fig. 6e, f) in the lungs. Furthermore, histopathological analysis of lung tissues of mice immunized at these doses showed minimal perivascular and alveolar infiltrates at 4 dpi, whereas those of control mice were characterized by extensive inflammation (Fig. 6g ). Mice immunized with 0.25 \u03bcg of 60% RBD SARS PLPs had levels of infectious virus and viral RNA in the lungs similar to those in control mice (Fig. 6d-f) , consistent with an inability to neutralize SARS-CoV-2 infection (Fig. 6b) . Additionally, these mice displayed more severe lung inflammation and injury versus those immunized with higher doses. Overall, the data indicate that neutralizing antibodies are essential for protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection and suggest that additional adaptive immune responses elicited by vaccination with RBD SARS -PLPs may contribute to protection against severe disease characterized by more extensive weight loss, such as the generation of memory T cells.",

The ability to rapidly decorate lambda PLPs with multiple immunogens of interest may be especially important for vaccine development against human CoVs, as the COVID-19 pandemic has been characterized by the repeated emergence of genetic variants of SARS-CoV-2 with distinct antigenic properties, such as the Omicron SARS-CoV-2 variant that emerged in late 2021 6 , that allow for escape from immunity elicited by vaccines based on historical viral variants. The platform allows for symmetrical, high-density display of multiple target antigens, thereby enhancing the stimulation of host immune responses. Properties of decorated PLPs present several advantages for use as an effective vaccine delivery vehicle, including (i) a particle size less than 200 nm, enabling entry into the lymphatic system 82 where adaptive immune responses are initiated; (ii) additional physiochemical properties such as surface charge, exposure of functional group, and hydrophobicity are easily manipulated by both genetic and chemical approaches; and (iii) simultaneous delivery of foreign molecules can be achieved on a single PLP. Further, we found no adverse effects due to immunization with phage lambda particles by intramuscular routes in mice even after repeated doses or after challenge (i.e., no evidence of vaccineenhanced disease such as more severe or distinct lung pathology), indicating a favorable safety profile for future in vivo testing.",

Additionally, immunized mice were protected against virulent virus challenge (up to day 184 post-prime for SARS-CoV-2 and day 102 for MERS-CoV) as indicated by significantly reduced virus-induced weight loss, a marked reduction in lung-associated inflammation and injury, and lower titers of infectious virus in the lungs paired with diminished levels of viral genomic and subgenomic RNA. Consistent with published studies 81 , PLPs decorated with the SARS-CoV-2 RBD alone do not elicit IgG that binds the MERS-CoV RBD or antibodies that neutralize MERS-CoV infection. In contrast, those simultaneously decorated with the SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV RBD proteins induce strong immune responses against both pathogenic viruses. This supports that co-displaying multiple antigens on the same particle is an effective means of broadening immune responses elicited by our vaccine platform and that the presence of multiple antigens does not interfere with each other.",

Most often, these immunization studies involve the use of large amounts of antigen (e.g., 50-100 \u03bcg/dose), up to four immunizations, formulation with an adjuvant (e.g., AddaVax), and vaccine administration routes not amenable to humans (e.g., intraperitoneal) 86, 89 . Our dose-response studies show that immunization with as little as one microgram of 60% RBD SARS -PLPs elicited robust neutralizing antibody responses and conferred protection against the SARS-CoV-2 challenge.
