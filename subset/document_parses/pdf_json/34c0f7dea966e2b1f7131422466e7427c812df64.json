The SARS-CoV-2 virus not only affects the human respiratory system, but also the gastrointestinal tract. The virus has been found in human feces, in sewage and in wastewater treatment plants. It has the potential to become a panzootic disease, as it is now proven that several mammalian species become infected. Since it has been shown that the virus can be detected in sewage even before the onset of symptoms in the local population, Wastewater Based Epidemiology should be developed not only to localize infection clusters of the primary wave but also to detect a potential second, or subsequent, wave. To prevent a panzootic, virus removal techniques from wastewater need to be implemented to prevent the virus dissemination into the environment. In that context, this review presents recent improvements in all the fields of wastewater treatment from treatment ponds to the use of algae or nanomaterials with a particular emphasis on membrane-based techniques.",

As of July 9 th 2020, the virus has infected more than 12 million people with the COVID-19 disease and claimed the lives of 552, 000 people. The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), as its given name indicates, primarily affects the respiratory system of the patients. However, COVID-19 has a broader range of symptoms, with digestive tract symptoms widely spread amongst patients. Moreover, a substantial portion of infected people are asymptomatic or have mild symptoms but still can transmit the virus. Lastly, SARS-CoV-2 is not only supposed to have been transmitted to humans through animal carriers, but humans can also transmit the disease to other animals.",

Subfamilies alpha and beta can affect humans. SARS-CoV-2 is from the subfamily Coronavirinae genera \u03b2 [2] sub-genus Sarbecovirus [3] Since 1960, there have been seven coronaviruses from these two subfamilies that have been reported to have affected humans [4, 5] : 229E, OC43, SARS-CoV, NL63, MERS, HKU1 and SARS-CoV-2.-229E, OC43, NL63, HKU1 are involved in 15 % of the common colds [5] whereas SARS-CoV, MERS and SARS-CoV-2 viruses are more virulent and they cause a severe acute respiratory syndrome(SARS). SARS-CoV outbreak was in 2002-2003 and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) broke out in the Arabian Peninsula in 2012 [1] . Bar-on et al. [6] provide regularly updated data in which can be found the SARS-CoV-2 size, which is around 100 nm. For membrane-based treatment processes, size is important as it determines the maximum pore size of the membrane which needs to be selected to remove the viral particles. Fig. 1 provides size and shape comparisons of several viruses. In this figure, virus sizes range from 20 nm to 970 nm. With 100 nm, SARS-CoV-2 is slightly smaller than SARS-CoV but is bigger than most common viruses.",

Since it shares 96 % whole genome identity to a bat coronavirus: BatCoV RaTG13 [53] , the bat Rhinolophus affinis from Yunnan province is suspected to be the original mammal hosting the precursor of SARS-CoV-2. However, the two provinces are distant from each other and the contacts between bats and humans are limited. It is possible that an intermediate animal host is involved in the transmission from animals to humans. The presence of pangolins in the putative starting point of the pandemic, which is the seafood market in Wuhan China, and the 91 % nucleotide identity of the Sars-CoV-2 with a pangolin CoV [6, 53] makes it a conjectured intermediate host [54] , Fig. 1 .

The ranking used the fact that the main receptor of SARS-CoV-2 is the angiotensin I converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Their study on 410 vertebrates, including 252 mammals could help identify potential animals that could be viral host. From this they judged that only mammals fell into the categories of medium or higher risk. In the meantime, in the Nederland on mink farms where minks had been found to be contaminated, sequencing was done on samples taken from diseased farmers and, while the topic is still under investigation, the transmission from minks to human seems to have occurred [56] .",

For environment specimen testing, the CDC defines that 'Procedures that concentrate viruses, such as precipitation or membrane filtration, can be performed in a BSL-2 laboratory with unidirectional airflow and BSL-3 precautions'. As a result, in general, virus surrogates are used instead of dangerous pathogens. The surrogate to be used depends on the experiment type to be handled. For example, to compare the virus concentration methods for wastewater testing, murine hepatitis virus (MHV) has been used as a SARS-CoV-2 surrogate [84] . Other animal coronaviruses such as the transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) and the feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) have also been used for testing the persistence and disinfection of human coronaviruses in water and wastewater [107] . For safety reasons some laboratories are using the enveloped bacteriophage \u03c66 [107] [108] [109] , whose size is 85 nm [110] , or the non-enveloped Escherichia virus MS2 [109, [111] [112] [113] [114] [115] [116] [117] [118] [119] [120] [121] [122] , whose size is 26 nm [123, 124] .",

They indicated that Reverse Osmosis is seldom used to remove pathogens from water even if it is one of the techniques reported by the EPA with indicative log removals above 6. This is because reverse osmosis is typically coupled with a pre-treatment system, often ultrafiltration, to reduce foulants which may interfere with the reverse osmosis process.

Without functionalization, they [144] . obtained log10 removal in the range of 0.3-3.4 for the bacteriophages MS2 and PhiX174, whereas after functionalization the log 10 removal was around 9. This increase in removal efficiency was due to favorable virus-treated membrane surface interactions, primarily due to hydrophobic interactions, which lead to adsorption of viruses to the membrane material. Presumably, such membranes would potentially be subjected to a sufficiently high saturation of viral concentration, thus necessitating cleaning.",
