New opportunities to slow down the aging process are emerging with new fields such as personalized nutrition. Data-intensive research has the potential to improve the precision of existing risk factors, e.g., to replace coarse-grained markers such as blood cholesterol with more detailed multivariate biomarkers. In this paper, we follow an attempt to develop a new aging biomarker. The vision among the project consortium, comprising both research and industrial partners, is that the new biomarker will be predictive of a range of age-related conditions, which may be preventable through personalized nutrition. We combine philosophical analysis and ethnographic fieldwork to explore the possibilities and challenges of managing aging through bodily signs that are not straightforwardly linked to symptomatic disease. We document how the improvement of measurement brings about new conceptual challenges of demarcating healthy and unhealthy states. Moreover, we highlight that the reframing of aging as risk has social and ethical implications, as it is generative of normative notions of what constitutes successful aging and good citizenship.",

Numerous health reports call for better scientific and technological solutions to address the socio-economic challenges resulting from population aging in Western societies (OECD 1998; European Commission 2018; Sundhedsstyrelsen 2010; WHO 2002 WHO , 2015 . Science should, however, not be viewed solely as a mediator of political ambitions to support longer and more active lives. As sociologist Tiago Moreira reminds us, we should also attend to \"how science, technology and medicine have been themselves implicated in the making of the ageing society\" (Moreira 2017, p. 7) . Science not only offers solutions to a predefined societal problem but also contributes to the framing of aging as a health problem. This paper explores the intertwined epistemic and social implications of the attempt to prevent disease by measuring and preventing aging. Towards this end, we follow an interdisciplinary project within the field of personalized nutrition that aims to develop a novel aging biomarker.",

            "text": "For decades, aging research has explored the potential of promoting healthier and longer lives by studying the factors that speed up or slow down the aging process. Aging is typically defined as progressive deterioration of body functions over time, and aging is hence associated with a higher prevalence of chronic diseases (Sprott 2010) . Although aging is unavoidable, the notion of healthy aging highlights that the rate of deterioration differs among individuals and is modifiable through actions recommended in health policies (WHO 2002 (WHO , 2015 Lamb 2017; Lassen and Moreira 2014) . Health policy recommendations are dependent on scientific strategies for measuring and monitoring aging, e.g., via molecular signs called aging biomarkers (Butler and Sprott 2000) . The quest for aging biomarkers has recently intensified with the emergence of omics fields, precision medicine, and personalized nutrition, thus opening the possibility of measuring aging more precisely through multivariate biomarkers (Levin 2014; Moskalev 2019) . 1 We focus in this paper on the recent reconceptualization of aging as risk, which is implied in the aforementioned policy reports and in scientific publications highlighting, e.g., how aging is \"the biggest risk factor for a majority of chronic diseases driving both morbidity and mortality\" (Kennedy et al. 2014, p. 709) . Previous papers in philosophy of science discuss the epistemic and ethical problems associated with risk profiling and screening of cancer and other complex diseases (e.g., Biddle 2016; Green and Vogt 2016; Plutynski 2012 Plutynski , 2017 . However, the analysis of the specific implications of prevention of age-related disease has so far received less attention in this field (see however Blasimme 2017 Blasimme , 2020 . Following Blasimme (2020) , we contend that the \"geriatric style of thought\" 2 brings optimism about the potential of managing later-life pathologies, but also faces difficult challenges of scientifically demarcating what counts as healthy and unhealthy aging. Moreover, our case study adds to previous scholarship showing how attempts to naturalize aging are constitutive of societal norms for managing and disciplining aging bodies (Katz 1996; Oxlund and Whyte 2014) .",

Predictive biomarkers are typically used to guide selection of treatment, as exemplified by tests for genetic variations to guide treatment selection for some types of cancer. Finally, prognostic biomarkers aim to predict future health outcomes, as exemplified in BRCA-testing for breast cancer. Variants (or biomarkers) that increase disease susceptibility are also referred to as risk factors.

The distinction between functional and chronological age is supported by observations of great variation in the speed of decline among individuals within the same (chronological) age group. Differences encountered between populations of \"fast\" and \"slow agers\" are hoped to point to modifiable molecular signs of aging. If biomedical technologies can detect these before a functional decline manifests at higher (phenotypic) levels of biological organization, it may be possible to take action to age in \"healthier\" ways.",

Preventive interventions associated with aging biomarkers include so-called geroprotective drugs and personalized nutrition, that aim to extend the general lifespan of an individual by lowering the risk of several age-related diseases (Moskalev 2019, ed.) . 3 Blasimme uses the notion of ground-state prevention to highlight how prevention of age-related decline aims to boost the baseline vitality as a way to counteract several age-related conditions (Blasimme 2020 this issue). But ground-state prevention also reawakens debates on the extent to which aging and age-related disease can and should be separated (Sprott 2010) , and about where to draw the line between the normal and the pathological (Canguilhem 1966 (Canguilhem /1991 Blasimme forthcoming) . In his book entitled The Metric Society, macro-sociologist Steffen Mau states: \"While a diagnosis works on the binary principle of ill versus healthy, health scores are based on scales or points. Their purpose is to motivate us not 'merely' to be healthy, but to keep striving for improvement\" (Mau 2019, p. 68) . While going beyond the dichotomy between disease and health, ground-state prevention raises new question about how to define the spectrum of health states. Moreover, it raises the intertwined epistemic and ethical question of whether there is (or should be) an upper limit to health improvement. As we shall show, our case illustrates how researchers are confronted with these philosophical questions when aiming to develop a new aging biomarker.",

            "text": "Biomarker research is currently advanced through technologies that allow for quantitative measurement of finer-grained bodily signs. However, the improvement of measurement does not automatically lead to improved prognosis or diagnosis. The introduction of the most iconic symbol of medicine, the stethoscope, illustrates well the persistent challenge. The invention of the stethoscope by La\u00ebnnec in 1816 provided a more objective and distanced measurement of what is \"inside the body\" and marked the beginning of technology-driven developments in medicine (Reiser 1978) . Nevertheless, the extension of human senses also came with new challenges of interpretation. While the stethoscope allowed for more precise detection and classification of heart murmurs among hospitalized patients, the status of heart murmurs as a diagnostic criterion for heart failure remained controversial (Binney 2016) . Particularly problematic was the introduction of the stethoscope as a vehicle for early diagnosis of heart disease. The Scottish cardiologist James Mackenzie criticized how such examinations impacted the lives of individuals with detected heart murmurs, as they were advised against doing physical labor and had to pay more for medical insurance, without having established firm knowledge about the relation between such signs and symptomatic heart problems (Mackenzie 1919; Binney 2016, p. 89) . Since most of these never developed heart problems, the example illustrates how introduction of prognostic technologies can unintentionally lead to harm if bodily signs are overinterpreted as indications of future disease. 4 We use the example of the stethoscope to illustrate how uncertainty about a diagnostic or prognostic test can arise when there is a lack of knowledge about the spectrum of variation of the physiological condition measured, or what is sometimes called spectrum bias or spectrum effect (Mulherin et al. 2002) . Different methodological designs have been explored to overcome this problem in biomarker research. A standard procedure in case-control and cohort studies compares the prevalence of a candidate risk factor in a patient population versus a healthy control group. The need for such methods underscores how biomarkers are inherently comparative and relational. They are statistically identified and defined as marking a measurable difference between reference populations, rather than representing a fixed biological entity or well-defined causal factor (Russo and Vineis 2016) . A common approach to identify aging biomarkers is to compare \"fast-agers,\" characterized by a given type of functional deterioration, to \"slow agers.\" Here, the control group represents healthy aging, which can be individuals with above-average health or centenarians as an extreme example of \"slow aging\" (Franceschi and Bonaf\u00e9 2003; Moreira 2017; Moskalev 2019, ed. ). Yet, the selection of the relevant reference populations can be challenging in aging research, as difficult choices must be taken when determining which individuals are sufficiently healthy to represent the control group. 5 Moreover, reference values for \"normal\" aging (functional performance or blood metabolites) change over a person's lifetime, and studies must be designed to account for the limitations of comparing and extrapolating test results across age groups. 6 4 Similar concerns about the risk of overdiagnosis have been expressed in the historical introduction of other technologies of measurement, such as blood pressure measurement, electrocardiography, and X-ray technology (Mackenzie 1919, pp.194-195) , cancer screening via imaging technologies (Plutynski 2012 (Plutynski , 2017 , and \"big data screening\" via omics technologies (Green and Vogt. 2016; Vogt et al. 2019) . 5 This challenges is related to what is more generally discussed as the reference class problem, i.e., the problem of how the choice of references classes can affect the assignment of probabilities to the individual case (see also Reichenbach 1949; H\u00e1jek 2007) . 6 Estimating how such changes occur over time (and thus how to classify age groups) is particularly challenging as one cannot assume that the speed of deterioration changes linearly with chronological age. A recent study suggests that blood metabolites change in wave-like dynamics with rapid shifts at certain points in time (Lehallier et al. 2019) . Discussing the implications of such findings is, however, beyond the scope of this paper. Biomarkers can be validated by testing their predictive capacity on new populations (or on data from similar studies). If successful, the next step is to demonstrate the effects of an intervention on the risk factor associated with adverse health outcomes. This is typically attempted through randomized controlled trials, comparing the effects of intervening on risk factors in one group to a control group. Positive effects are typically most significant where there is a relatively simple and strong relationship between risk factor and disease, such as between smoking and lung capacity or lung cancer. But it has often proven difficult to change the development of complex diseases via interventions on risk factors. For instance, a large randomized controlled study recently documented a successful reduction in risk factors of ischemic heart disease (blood cholesterol, blood pressure, obesity) through lifestyle intervention. However, after ten years, the researchers observed no long-term effect on morbidity and mortality of the intervention group compared to the control group (J\u00f8rgensen et al. 2014 ). The challenge of prevention via intervention on classical risk factors such as blood cholesterol is also reflected in discussions about the benefit-to-harm ratio of statin treatment, especially among individuals with relatively low risk of heart disease (Abrahamson et al. 2013; Collins et al. 2016; Dumit 2012; Greene 2007; Ruscica et al. 2018 ). As we shall see below, this challenge is also motivating the project we have followed.",

It is hoped that improvement of measurement, via multivariate statistics on large datasets, can better account for interactions between multiple causal factors, thus giving way for more precise profiling of aging and risk (Levin 2014; Putin et al. 2016) . The aim to account for patientspecific differences that impact disease development is pursued in the fields of personalized medicine and personalized nutrition. The latter is based on the idea that molecular profiling (via blood or stool samples) can help suggest personalized diets of benefit for the individual (Scrinis 2015) . In the following, we explore how opportunities and challenges play out in this field through insights from ethnographic fieldwork in a data-intensive research project that aims to develop a rapid and robust screening tool for age-related changes in lipoprotein metabolism. The researchers we followed teamed up with a large food industry consortium that wants to explore the possibilities of delivering new functional food products for individualized prevention based on screening for aging biomarkers.",

While industry partners were asking for test results that allow them to develop and market protein products to specific LPD-profiles, statisticians expressed difficulties in delivering quantitative results without prior agreement on what health is. In one of the meetings, a statistician drew a circle in a coordinate system (Fig. 1) to represent the requirement of boundaries that quantitatively demarcate data points representing healthy and unhealthy states. Pointing to the circle representing such a boundary, he said: \"Define health for me, and I will find it for you,\" To that, a metabolomics industry partner replied: \"No, give me a pattern, and I will give you health!\".",

However, as documented in an analysis by Vogt, Hoffman, and Getz (2016a, b) , identifying a \"reference expression\" presupposes a health reference population that cannot itself be identified via data-intensive methods. Hence, the requirement for a reference population, makes the effort of biomarker precision inherently dependent on preexisting notions of health that the same field is trying to update and go beyond. The circularity in the task to improve definitions of health or aging need not be vicious, as ongoing scientific analyses can iteratively improve existing biomarkers and sharpen medical definitions (cf.

The quotes seem to suggest that any aging trajectory, no matter how slow it may be, could become a potential target for further risk reduction. Hence, research on aging biomarkers brings new light to discussions about how risk management is historically constructed through a complex interplay of epistemic and non-epistemic values (Douglas 2009; Hilgartner 1992) .

This saying highlights how biomarker research needs a material referent of (extreme) variation to get off the ground. The researcher's critical reflection on the limitations of their study design resonates with George Canguilhem's criticism of Auguste Comte, who insisted that the normal and its \"true limits of variation\" could and should be defined before investigating pathological cases (Canguilhem 1966 (Canguilhem /1996 . In contrast, Canguilhem argued that the normal is always defined in relation to the pathological, and that neither are free of normative connotations. The discussion on sarcopenia illustrates this point well, as it is not clear where an age-related loss of muscle mass falls on the spectrum between the normal and the pathological.",

            "text": "Aging involves a gradual loss of muscle mass, but at what point does sarcopenia become a risk factor or a health issue that calls for intervention? Sarcopenia was introduced in 1989 as a medical term for age-related loss of muscle mass, but, in 2016, it was assigned a disease code in the International Classification of Disease (ICD-10) system (B\u00fclow et al. 2019) . B\u00fclow et al. problematize the new consensus definition because it conflates loss of skeletal muscle mass with loss of physical function. Aside from the risk of making the definition tautological or circular, the definition conceals that loss of physical function can have many other causes. Moreover, loss of physical function is a complex measure that is not straightforwardly related to health problems, which raises ethical dilemmas. As Blasimme (2017) highlights, if sarcopenia is defined as functional decline, and hence as a potential reduction in a person's freedom to maintain autonomy in daily life, then the health care system would be ethically committed to doing something about it (e.g., to implement a screening and treatment program). On the other hand, if a person could have an age-related loss of muscle mass without suffering from functional decline, the medicalization of sarcopenia becomes more controversial. Hence, debates on sarcopenia illustrate how scientific categories and social values are intertwined and may mutually constrain each other (Longino 2002; Plutynski 2012 Plutynski , 2017 .",

Such arguments have been advanced in the context of precision medicine, where proponents distinguish their strategies for health promotion from traditional screening (Magis et al. 2018 ). However, the negative impact of medicalization is not necessarily tied to increased medication. Instead, medicalization refers to the implications of defining more and more aspects of life in relation to aims defined within the medical domain (Conrad 2007; Vogt et al. 2016b ). If there is no upper limit to what constitutes healthy aging, any sign of deterioration becomes a potential target for age-preventive strategies (Estes and Binney 1989; Oxford and Whyte 2014) . As a result, attempts to slow down the aging process may become a life-long preoccupation, or what Blasimme (2020) calls the agificication of life itself.",

Jecker highlights the extreme example of how we often try to respect autonomy long after it is beyond the capacities of a person with severe dementia (see also Gj\u00f8dsb\u00f8l et al. 2017) . Similarly, it is important to keep in mind that preventing sarcopenia to maintain physical functionality may not always be the primary goal, as it has to compete with other values of a good life, such as freedom from dietary restrictions or stigmatization of lifestyle choices. From the perspective of elderly citizens, it may also be relevant to consider how maintenance of autonomy, e.g., capacity to perform daily tasks despite sarcopenia, can often be achieved in other ways, such as via the use of assistive devices (Blasimme 2017) . Our aim is not to problematize current health policies per se, but rather to expose the normative assumptions in the discourse on individualized strategies for healthy aging and open these for further scrutiny. 13 Interestingly, these deep philosophical problems were also present in meetings in the COUNTERSTRIKE project. In one meeting, one of the researchers asked, \"why don't we talk about the good death?\" The open question was posed as a reaction to the focus on the physiological aging body as something that needs to be shaped and intervened on, thus excluding vulnerability and decay as natural processes of old bodies (cf. Kaufman 2015) . It highlights how the very notions of \"aging biomarkers,\" \"healthy aging,\" and \"active aging\" are simultaneously scientific concepts and policy tools that influence the very way aging is viewed and enacted (Lassen and Moreira 2014; Douglas 2009 ).",

Yet, as this ideal seems achievable only to a limited extent, it raises the question of what it means to age \"healthy\" or \"naturally,\" whether there is an upper limit to healthy aging, and how such limits are shaped by science policy. The intensified focus on aging biomarkers and the management of age-related disease raise intriguing questions about the implications of medicalization and agification of life itself, and about what the promotion of better and longer lives entails. While science can inform us about the relations between phenotypic functions and resilience to perturbations, we cannot escape the difficult ethical discussion of where it is meaningful to draw the line.",
