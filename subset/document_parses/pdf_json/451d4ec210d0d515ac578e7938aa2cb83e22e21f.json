[1] [2] [3] [4] Government-implemented shelter in place guidelines are successful in preventing the spread of disease but impact people's ability to meet other physical, social, and health needs, particularly in rural communities. 5 People who use drugs (PWUDs) may be at increased risk of mental health complications, suicide, overdose, and trauma due to COVID-19 in rural America. 6 The medical and public health urgency of controlling SARS-Co-V2 has changed how social and mental health services are delivered. 7 Mental health professionals and facilities have modified operations to prevent COVID-19 infection. 8 This effect may be exacerbated for PWUD in rural communities, who already experience limited access to mental and physical health services due to systemic barriers and stigma. 9 Enduring the COVID-19 pandemic may lead to an increased risk of suicide due to changes in financial, mental, and physical health and lack of subsequent support. 10 Passive suicidal ideation is also heightened in individuals with depression, anxiety, and psychosis, 11 and PWUD are at greater risk of death by suicide than the general population. 12 In recent years, suicide rates have increased 13 and are expected to continue to increase due to COVID-19-related stressors. 14 During times of crisis (eg, 2008 financial crisis; collapse of the Soviet Union; aftermath of 9/11), people report increased substance use, 15, 16 and during COVID-19 that has been reflected in the increase in call volume to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration's disaster distress hotline and increased reported mental health conditions and substance use. 4 Isolation, increased substance use, and limiting access to care may increase the risk of mental health crisis and overdose risk among PWUD. 6 After a decrease in overdose deaths for the first time in 2019,",

Although the nature of rapid assessment precluded concurrent analysis for saturation, the interview team met daily during data collection to assess saturation through discussion of interview content.

Overall, the Kappa Coefficients (71.7% within the moderate to substantial agreement range) and percentage agreements (94.1%-100.0%) were high.

The following constellation of factors raises concerns: increases in reported mental health issues, substance use, suicidal ideation, and passive suicidal actions and lack of treatment seeking and perceived access during COVID-19. During times of crisis, additional encouragement and resources are imperative to address increased, intersecting needs and mitigate long-term impacts. Addiction treatment providers and policy makers should engage in innovative solutions and flexible options (eg, telemedicine, loosening MOUD restrictions). 25, 26 Our study identifies several areas of future research. As guidelines encourage people to physically distance and limit movement, PWUD should have opportunities to get more needs met in fewer places. The role of syringe service programs and other community-based organizations that support PWUDs should be explored for their potential to provide and connect PWUD to many resources in 1 location, including serving as a hub for PWUD to attend virtual visits with health care and other service providers. Research should also address the impact of peer-delivered support services to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on the mental health and substance use of PWUD. Peer recovery support specialists, through an emphasis on shared experiences, provide support, encouragement, and hope to PWUD. 27 Limitations of our study should be noted. We focused on 5 rural Oregon counties; findings may not be generalizable to other rural communities. We did not interview PWUD in urban settings, the sample was limited to individuals that had access to a telephone, and interviews were conducted at the beginning of the rapidly changing COVID-19 environment in Oregon. Our sample was also overwhelmingly non-Hispanic White, and we did not explore how social identities (eg, sex, race, class, housing status) intersect to impact mental health, substance use behaviors, or overdose concerns. Future research should include a more diverse sample and an intersectional lens to examine the impact of COVID-19 on PWUD in other rural communities and should include more in-depth exploration of the impacts of COVID-19 depending on people's drug of choice.",
