Molecular-based testing is used to diagnose COVID-19, and serologic testing of antibodies specific to SARS-CoV-2 is used to detect past infection. While most serologic assays are qualitative, a quantitative serologic assay was recently developed that measures antibodies against the S protein, the target of vaccines. Quantitative antibody determination may help determine antibody titer and facilitate longitudinal monitoring of the antibody response, including antibody response to vaccines. We evaluated the quantitative Roche Elecsys anti-SARS-CoV-2 S assay. Specimens from 167 PCR-positive patients and 103 control specimens were analyzed using the Elecsys anti-SARS-CoV-2 S assay on the cobas e411 (Roche Diagnostics). Analytical evaluation included assessing linearity, imprecision, and analytical sensitivity. Clinical evaluation included assessing clinical sensitivity, specificity, cross-reactivity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and serial sampling from the same patient. The Elecsys anti-SARS-CoV-2 S assay exhibited its highest sensitivity (84.0%) at 15 to 30 days post-PCR positivity and exhibited no crossreactivity, a specificity and PPV of 100%, and an NPV between 98.3% and 99.8% at $14 days post-PCR positivity, depending on the seroprevalence estimate. Imprecision was ,2% at 9.06 U/ml across 6 days, the negative quality control (QC) was consistently negative (,0.40 U/ml), the manufacturer's claimed limit of quantitation of 0.40 U/ml was verified, and linearity across the analytical measuring range was observed, except at the low end (,20 U/ml). Lastly, antibody response showed high interindividual variation in level and time of peak antibody titer and trends over time.",

            "text": "T he severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). First declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern in January 2020 by the World Health Organization (WHO), COVID-19 has infected over 88 million people globally, causing over 1.9 million deaths as of 10 January 2021 (https://www.who.int/publications/m/item/ weekly-epidemiological-update---12-january-2021). While molecular-based testing is used to diagnose COVID-19 (1), serologic testing of antibodies specific to SARS-CoV-2 is used to detect past infection (2) . Serologic testing may aid in surveying asymptomatic infection, assessing past SARS-CoV-2 infection prevalence, or serving as an adjunct for COVID-19 diagnosis if used $15 days after symptom onset in cases with suggestive clinical presentation but negative or unavailable reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) results (3) (4) (5) (6) . Most serologic assays are qualitative and use either full-length or truncated versions of the nucleocapsid (N) or spike (S) SARS-CoV-2 protein as the target for antibody detection. Roche recently developed a quantitative serologic assay that measures antibodies against the receptor-binding domain of the S protein, the target of vaccines in development and in use (7) , and thus may aid in characterizing the immune response to vaccines. The S protein facilitates viral entry to various host cells via binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) (8) , and antibodies directed against the S protein have been shown to have potent antiviral activity and correlate to potential immunity (9) . Quantitative determination of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies may help determine specific antibody titer, facilitate longitudinal monitoring of the antibody response in individual patients, and specifically monitor antibody response to vaccines.",

The poor linearity observed below 20 U/ml by mixing patient pools, mixing single patient samples, or using diluent may not be particularly concerning, as samples should not be diluted down to concentrations this low in clinical practice. Indeed, the Roche package insert states that the concentration of the diluted sample must be $20 U/ml. Our linearity assessments involved creating and measuring dilution series, which determines whether the measured concentration changes as expected according to the proportional relationship between samples created with different dilution factors. Poor linearity below 20 U/ml would be concerning if inaccuracy was observed in this concentration range, perhaps if materials of known concentration (not created by dilution) were analyzed across the measuring range. The concentrations of both QC materials used for imprecision assessment were ,20 U/ml and were within the manufacturer's stated ranges, suggesting accuracy at low concentrations. Imprecision was minimal (i.e., 1.26% at 9.06 U/ml), and the manufacturer's claimed LoQ of 0.40 U/ml was verified.",

While we report the same observation as the manufacturer of higher sensitivity at $14 days post-PCR positivity compared to that at ,14 days, we obtained lower estimates than the manufacturer's claimed sensitivity of 98.8% at $14 days after diagnosis with positive PCR and 86.1% at ,14 days. This may be due to the patient population characteristics, particularly the large immunocompromised population at UHN. Overall, 90.0% of patients positive for SARS-CoV-2 by PCR testing but negative by the Elecsys anti-SARS-CoV-2 S assay were also negative on four other qualitative serologic assays (10), supporting the inability of these patients to produce antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. Another potential reason that our sensitivity estimates were lower than those claimed by the manufacturer could be the potential preferential inclusion or requirement of individuals with low cycle threshold values on PCR by the manufacturer, therefore including subjects with a relatively higher viral load. To ensure that the reason for our lower sensitivity was not simply having antibody titers just below the positivity cutoff (i.e., between the LoQ of 0.40 U/ml and the positivity cutoff of 0.80 U/ml), we recalculated the total sensitivity and sensitivity for different categories based on days since PCR positivity using 0.40 U/ml as the positivity cutoff. No sensitivity estimates significantly changed, as only two samples had antibody concentration between 0.40 U/ml and 0.80 U/ml. It is important to note that negative results cannot rule out current or past SARS-CoV-2 infection because results are negative in the preseroconversion phase of infection, some patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection do not develop antibodies, and antibody titers may wane in individuals within months of infection (11, 12) . Our specificity estimate of 100% is in accordance with the manufacturer's claimed specificity of 99.98%. We also recalculated the specificity using 0.40 U/ml as the positivity cutoff, and the specificity did not significantly change (i.e., decreased from 100% [95% CI, 100% to 100%] to 99.0% [95% CI, 97.1% to 100%]). We observed no cross-reactivity in 103 samples tested that contained potentially cross-reacting substances (e.g., samples from patients with autoimmune disease or other viral infections), similar to the manufacturer (i.e., no cross-reactivity in 1,100 samples tested). Due to the estimated specificity of 100%, PPV was also 100% for ,14 days and $14 days post-PCR positivity across all seroprevalence estimates. NPV was slightly lower than PPV, was higher at $14 days post-PCR positivity compared to that at ,14 days, and decreased with higher seroprevalence estimates.",

Others have also reported on interindividual difference in SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses (4, 13) , yet this is the first report of SARS-CoV-2 antibody trends using a quantitative assay. As mentioned previously, quantitative determination of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies may help facilitate longitudinal monitoring of the antibody response in individual patients and specifically monitor antibody response to vaccines. As observed from the results of antibody titer in serial samples from PCR-positive patients, this assay was useful in delineating various trends over time in antibody response. However, we did not specifically examine the ability of this assay to monitor antibody response to vaccines. While this test may have utility in this area due to the antigen used to capture the antibodies in the assay exhibiting similarity to that used in the vaccines, monitoring the response ",
