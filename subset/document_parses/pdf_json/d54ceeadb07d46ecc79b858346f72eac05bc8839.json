            "text": "Stabilizing antigenic proteins as vaccine immunogens or diagnostic reagents is a stringent case of protein engineering and design as the exterior surface must maintain recognition by receptor(s) and antigen-specific antibodies at multiple distinct epitopes. This is a challenge, as stabilityenhancing mutations must be focused on the protein core, whereas successful computational stabilization algorithms typically select mutations at solvent-facing positions. In this study we report the stabilization of SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan Hu-1 Spike receptor binding domain (S RBD) using a combination of deep mutational scanning and computational design, including the FuncLib algorithm. Our most successful design encodes I358F, Y365W, T430I, and I513L RBD mutations, maintains recognition by the receptor ACE2 and a panel of different anti-RBD monoclonal antibodies, is between 1-2 o C more thermally stable than the original RBD using a thermal shift assay, and is less proteolytically sensitive to chymotrypsin and thermolysin than the original RBD. Our approach could be applied to the computational stabilization of a wide range of proteins without requiring detailed knowledge of active sites or binding epitopes, particularly powerful for cases when there are multiple or unknown binding sites.",

However, many stabilizing mutations can reduce activity or function in the engineered protein (Beadle and Shoichet 2002) . Thus, balancing the tradeoff between improved stability and maintaining function remains a major challenge for the protein designer. Previous work to predict non-disruptive stabilizing mutations have incorporated factors such as evolutionary conservation (Goldenzweig et al. 2016 ), distance to an active site or binding site (Tokuriki et al. 2007) , and the local packing density (Klesmith et al. 2017 , Wrenbeck et al. 2019 ). These and other prediction methods can successfully identify stabilizing mutations with neutral impact on activity without large directed evolution campaigns.",

            "text": "However, such prediction methods identify potential stabilizing mutations that are located predominantly at or peripheral to the solvent-contacting surface of the protein. Additionally, the set of mutations identified typically are not in direct contact and thus are usually independent of other mutations (Goldenzweig et al. 2016 ). Yet for many applications, like immunogen or diagnostic reagent design, the surface of the protein must remain unchanged. Design strategies then would be akin to remodeling a historic building, in which the interior may be reinforced and updated as needed within the requirement that the exterior structure is preserved intact. In this stringent design case, the surface structure can be held in place during computational design with constraints on movement, while interior, non-solvent-exposed residues are allowed to vary as necessary barring major deformation of the protein backbone. Stabilizing protein vaccine immunogens is an example of a relevant application because effective stabilized antigens must retain the ability to bind many different antibodies at distinct epitopes across the protein surface and only a small fraction of the epitopes are known. Rather than risk damaging these epitopes, protein core redesign can be used on the protein from the inside out without making significant changes to the surface structure.",

The protein structure is composed primarily of beta sheets with connecting loop and helices and contains nine cysteine residues, eight of which form four disulfide bonds: C336-C361, C379-C432, C480-C488, and C391-C525 (Lan et al. 2020) (Fig 1A) . The receptor binding motif (RBM) spans residues 438-506 and contains the binding surface for the cell receptor ACE2 (Lan et al. 2020 , Wrapp et al. 2020 . Away from the RBM, the protein core contains several under-packed regions, most notably a cryptic linoleic acid binding pocket surrounded by positions F338, V341, F342, I358, C361, A363, L368, F374, C379, L387, and F392 (Toelzer et al. 2020 ) and a buried unsatisfied polar group at Y365. The presence of under-packed hollow cavities and side chains with unsatisfied hydrogen bonds in the core suggests that mutations could improve stability, as successfully demonstrated by the introduction of key RBD mutations into this fatty acid binding pocket by the King lab (Ellis et al. 2021) . In a different approach, the King lab also reduced protein aggregation by mutating hydrophobic patches on the surface (Dalvie et al. 2021) , though this could potentially remove critical epitopes recognized by the immune system.",

We used two different Rosetta design protocols (see Methods) to introduce mutations into the RBD protein core, leaving the four disulfide bonds intact. The first method used the FuncLib automated design method (Khersonsky et al. 2018 ) to target mutations to two distinct core regions away from the RBM, separated by an internal beta sheet. FuncLib starts with a phylogenetic analysis, restricting design at each of the selected amino acid positions only to mutations that are commonly observed among natural homologs. Then, the method models each mutation in Rosetta, allowing the structure to adapt to the mutation using whole-protein minimization and filtering mutations that are highly destabilizing. Finally, all combinations of mutations at the allowed positions are enumerated using Rosetta atomistic design, relaxed using whole-protein minimization and ranked by energy.

Relative protein stability was assessed using a yeast surface protease susceptibility assay (Rocklin et al. 2017 ) in which incubation with chymotrypsin cleaves RBD, resulting in diminished ACE2 binding under saturating ACE2 concentrations (Fig 1G) . Treatment with increasing concentrations of chymotrypsin showed that yeast displayed RBD1 is more proteolytically sensitive than WT (pvalue = 0.0039 at 1,111 U/ml chymotrypsin and p-value = 0.039 at 10,000 U/ml chymotrypsin, n = 4) (Fig 1H) .

We neglected these hits as mutations at N501 are known to impact ACE2 affinity, including the N501Y mutation found in several Variants of Concern. The greatest surprise from the protease screen was that five of the eight mutations included in the RBD1 design (at positions 368, 410, 418, 438, 513) were found to have the WT residue at least somewhat enriched, suggesting that a reversion of that RBD1 mutation back to the wild-type sequence is stabilizing at that position (Fig 2C, Fig 3A) . The overwhelming majority of other hits are concentrated in the underpacked core where the cryptic linoleic acid binding pocket occurs, most notably at positions 363 & 365 (Fig 2C, Fig 3A) . There are a number of small to large aliphatic substitutions occurring at this pocket, including A363WPMILV, A397ML, I434F, and F392W. RBD1 contains a Y365W; both Y and W are disfavored relative to smaller aliphatics without hydrogen bond acceptors or donors. By contrast, the partially surface exposed V362 prefers the isosteric substitution threonine with hydrogen bonding potential.",

The parsimonious design RBD6 is encoded by reversion of four mutations at positions 368, 410, 418, and 438. All other designs used this reversion as a base. We used Rosetta FastDesign on multiple RBD structures (see Methods) allowing either the RBD6 residue or a residue sourced from deep mutational scanning (Fig 3C) . Two of the designs used all forty of the deep mutational scanning hits along with other potential hits just below the average depth of coverage. To add additional diversity of mutations, additional mutations were mined from a related deep mutational scanning dataset from Starr et al. (Starr et al. 2020 ) that quantified the effect of mutation on protein expression rather than stability. Since expression in yeast surface display is correlated with protein stability (Klesmith et al. 2017) , core mutations that increase expression are likely to be stabilizing. Two designs incorporated mutations sourced from the Starr dataset. Finally, two designs considered mutations from both the Starr et al dataset along with the deep mutational scan from the current work.",

Their choice to more narrowly focus on linoleic acid binding pocket mutations led to the creation of top designs containing only mutation F392W and mutations Y365F, F392W, and V395I, with melting temperatures of 1.9-2.4\u00b0C and 3.8-5.3\u00b0C above wild type, respectively (Ellis et. al. 2021 ). All of these mutations except V395I were identified at a high read depth by the protease library screen and show convergent strategies for RBD redesigns, even with distinct mutations. Thus we view our work as complementary to, and confirmatory of, the RBD redesign strategy employed by Ellis and colleagues.",

In some respects, these issues are intertwined -higher throughput measurements combined with facile assembly of gene-length designs would allow for testing a richer diversity of design concepts than the two methods implemented here. On the computational side, the implementation of FuncLib led to a workable design whereas the three more aggressive FastDesign constructs did not display on the yeast surface. The number of mutations considered from the original sequence (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) is in the range of successful PROSS designs, as each mutation contributes perhaps 0.5-1 o C increase in Tm. In this specific case of the S RBD with only 80 or so mutable core residues, the number of mutations considered in the first round of designs was perhaps too aggressive and we would argue for the importance of parsimony in the set of initial future designs. The two-tiered screening strategy (design, experimentally characterize, then design again) resulted in a more stable RBD6 construct. However, RBD6 was a minimal reversion of the RBD1 construct, and more aggressive designs considering additional mutations ranged from minimally successful to failures. Two-tiered screening has a higher probability of success with a large diversity of the designs, such that potential failure modes are not shared between different designs.",

Our designs used both clear hits with average enrichment ratio greater than one, but also included some mutations with much lower average read depth (below 60) in order to increase diversity of designs. These borderline mutations generally were unsuccessful. Second, our scan considered only single point mutations from the RBD6 design. The majority of the hits were located at or adjacent to the linoleic acid binding pocket, and the experiment did not allow us to determine whether coupling of these individually stabilizing mutations were beneficial. Of course, introducing combinations of mutations increases the size of the library exponentially, and more clever library design would be needed to keep the number of variants to a manageable level. For this example, clear ways to limit library diversity would be to remove inviolable positions like the 8 cysteines involved in the 4 disulfide bonds, removal of positions like N501 where many residues are solvent exposed, and considering a reduced aliphatic alphabet (e.g. F,L,I,M,V,Y,A) rather than all 20 amino acids at .
