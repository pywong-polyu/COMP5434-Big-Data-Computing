            "text": "Background Social capital has been associated with many public health variables including mortality, obesity, diabetes, and sexually-transmitted disease rates. However, the relationship of social capital to the spread of infectious disease like COVID-19 is lacking. The COVID-19 pandemic presents an unprecedented threat to global health and economy, for which control strategies have relied on aggressive social distancing. However, an understanding of how social capital is related to changes in human mobility patterns for adherence to social distancing is lacking. Objective This study examines the association between state-and county-level social capital indices and community health indices in the United States, and the growth rate of COVID-19 cases. It also examines changes in human mobility. Methods Using publicly available state-and county-specific time series data for COVID-19 cases from March 13 to March 31, we used exponential fits to determine growth rate. We obtained publicly available mobility change data, originally measured from GPS-enabled mobile devices. The design was then stateand county-level correlation analysis with social capital and community health indices from the Social Capital Project (United States Senate). Results In bivariate linear correlation analyses, we find social capital and community health indices were negatively associated with COVID-19 growth rates at both the state and county levels. The correlation was strongest at the county level for the community health index: a one-unit increase in the county community health index was associated with a decrease in the COVID-19 growth rate exponent by 0.045. In further bivariate correlation analyses, we find that social capital indices were negatively associated with retail/recreation movement and positively associated with residential movement. That is, an increase in social capital is correlated with slower COVID-19 infection spread and more adherence to social distancing protocols. Conclusion Our results indicate the potential benefit of incorporating social capital concepts in planning policies to control the spread of COVID-19, e.g. different social distancing requirements in different communities. The results also indicate a need for further research into this potentially causal relationship, including examining interventions to increase social capital, community health, and institutional health.",

            "text": "The concept of social capital was initially developed in the social sciences [1] , but has become central to understanding the social determinants of public health over the last two decades. Within public health research, social capital is defined as the resources available to individuals via their membership and active participation in community networks and is said to reside in the structure and quality of relationships among community members [2] [3] [4] . Proxy indicators of area-level social capital are typically used to explain variations in health status across geographic localities. For the United States, such social capital indices are available at the state-and county-levels [5, 6] . Metastudies demonstrate the widespread positive impact social capital has on (or associations with) numerous public health variables including mortality, obesity, diabetes, and sexually-transmitted infection rates [7] . There has been little characterization, however, of associations between social capital and other infectious diseases [8, 9] , including the novel coronavirus disease COVID-19, for which the absence of a vaccine necessitates the use of aggressive social distancing to control its unprecedented global pandemic. Moreover, there has been little characterization of association between social capital and the rate at which movement is decreased under social distancing.",

For individuals, they calculate distance traveled by measuring a line between opposite corners of a box drawn around the locations observed for each person on each day. The travel for each county is the median of these per-person distances. The weekly average is the arithmetic mean of this quantity, and the quantity we consider is the percentage change as compared to the yearly average. We use the week of March 23. This is a fairly coarse measure of mobility and does not capture the kind of fine-grained information about social distancing that contact tracing [21] would. For example, if one's long commute was replaced by greater social interaction with neighbors, the mobility index would decrease significantly yet social contacts would increase and reduce the effectiveness of contagion control via social distancing.",

These report change in movement by state and county, across different categories of places such as retail and recreation, and residential-the two categories we focus on, as they are where one would expect strong decreases and increases, respectively, under social distancing. For each day, the reports provide changes as compared to a baseline value for that day of the week during the 5-week period between January 3 and February 6, 2020. We consider the county level and average the daily percentages for the seven-day period between March 23 and March 29. The data does not include all counties, and so we end up with 2500 counties in our dataset. 1 3 Results Figures 1 and 2 show the results of our bivariate analysis at the state and county levels, respectively for both social capital and community health indices. At the state level, we find a statistically significant negative correlation between fitted COVID-19 growth rate exponent and both social capital and community health indices: the more these indices, the slower the COVID-19 spread. The social capital index explains 9.2% of the variation in exponent, and the community health sub-index explains 11.7% of the variation. The effect size is such that each point of increase in social capital index corresponds to a 0.015 decrease in the growth exponent; each point of increase in the community health index corresponds to a 0.017 decrease in growth exponent. Since social capital and community health are community-level attributes of local phenomena, their attributes are likely better captured at the smaller geographic level of counties than states [5] . At the county level, we find similar but stronger associations. In particular, we also find statistically significant negative correlations between fitted COVID-19 growth rate exponent and both social capital and community health indices at the county level. The community health index explains 16.2% of the variation. The effect size is such that each point of increase in social capital index corresponds to a 0.023 decrease in the growth exponent; each point of increase in the community health index corresponds to a 0.045 decrease in growth exponent. To give a sense of this impact, if the growth exponent decreased by 0.045 from 0.15 to 0.105, it cooresponds to an increase from a doubling time from 4.62 days to 6.60 days.",

Fig. 4 shows that the social capital index at the county level only explains a small amount of variation in reducing a coarse-grained index of mobility reduction for the week of March 23.
