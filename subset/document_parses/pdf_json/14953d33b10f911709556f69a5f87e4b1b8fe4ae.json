We propose to investigate the question of how societies as a whole, and governments in particular, modulate the dynamics of a novel epidemic using a generalization of the SIR model, the controlled SIR model. We posit that containment measures are equivalent to a feedback between the status of the outbreak and the reproduction factor. Short-term control of an outbreak, corresponds in this framework to the reaction of governments and individuals to daily cases and fatalities. The reaction to the cumulative number of cases or deaths, and not to daily numbers, is captured in contrast by long-term control. We present the exact phase space solution of the controlled SIR model and use it to quantify containment policies for a large number of countries in terms of short-and long-term control parameters. We find increased contributions of long-term control for countries and regions in which the outbreak was suppressed substantially together with a strong correlation between the strength of societal and governmental policies and the time needed to contain COVID-19 outbreaks. Furthermore, for numerous countries and regions we identified a predictive relation between the number of fatalities within a fixed period before and after the peak daily fatality count which predicts the cumulative medical load of COVID-19 outbreaks that should be expected after the peak. These results suggest applicability of the proposed model not only for understanding the outbreak dynamics, but also for predicting future cases and fatalities once the effectiveness of outbreak suppression policies is established with sufficient certainty.",

            "text": "1 Introduction 1 Epidemic outbreaks differ widely with respect to the parameters defining their 2 dynamics and societal impact, such as infection rate, fatality rate, and the rate of 3 critical cases requiring hospitalization. In order to gauge the effectiveness and 4 suitability of policies enacted for outbreak containment one needs therefore to discern 5 the outbreak parameters. However, in novel outbreak the precise assessment of any of 6 these quantities and a prediction of disease spreading is in practice a notoriously 7 difficult task [1] . Outbreak case data at early stages is often both noisy and biased [2] , 8 which implies that core epidemiological parameters cannot be estimated with sufficient 9 precision. This is a hard limitation of any epidemics-forecasting approach, as small 10 differences in disease dynamical properties can lead to drastically different outcomes [3] . 11 However, in spite of these limitations, it is safe to assume that both individuals and 12 governments will react to a spread of a new infectious disease. Given the severity of the 13 COVID-19 outbreak [4] , it is unsurprising that the raising case and fatality numbers not 14 only forced governments to impose lock-down measures [5, 6] , but also motivated people 15 to avoid travelling and mass gatherings [7] . Hence, to understand the dynamics of 16 COVID-19 outbreak, we propose to model the feedback of spontaneous societal and 17 imposed governmental restrictions using a standard epidemic model that is modified in 18 one key point: the reproduction rate of the virus is not constant, but evolves over time 19 alongside with the disease in a way that leads to a 'flattening of the curve' [8] . The 20 basis of the proposed model is the SIR (Susceptible, Infected, Recovered) model, which 21 describes the evolution of a contagious disease for which immunity persists substantially 22 longer than the outbreak itself [9] . We extend the model by introducing a negative 23 feedback loop between the severity of the outbreak and the initial reproduction rate g 0 . 24 Our model contains two parameters, \u03b1 X and \u03b1 I , which control respectively the amount 25 of long-and short-term epidemic control. The first, \u03b1 X , quantifies the contribution of 26 the cumulative case count X to the negative feedback loop. For the second parameter, 27 \u03b1 I , short-term control, the growth rate is reduced when the current number of active 28 cases, I, is large. The resulting process is denoted the controlled SIR model. 29 The controlled SIR model draws its motivation from previous epidemiology 30 modelling. One of the first evidences showing that human behaviour affects spreading 31 dynamics [10, 11], came from the study of measles epidemics [12] . Generalizations of the 32 SIR model account for various effects of societal response to an outbreak, such as 33 self-isolation [13], contact-frequency reduction and quarantine [14] , changes in human 34 mobility [15] , together with the effects of geographic and societal networks [16] , and of 35 explicit feedback loops [17] . For a detailed analysis, epidemiology models can be 36 extended to cover a range of additional aspects [18] , with an example being the 37 distinction between symptomatic and asymptomatic cases [19] . These kind of complex 38 models are in general not accessible to an explicit analytic handling. It has also been 39 questioned, whether detailed modelling leads to improved predictions [1, 2] , given that 40 field data is inherently noisy.",

Additionally, we show that the descriptions of 45 COVID-19 field data is substantially improved when both short-term and long-term 46 control are included. For data analysis and model validation, we use publicly available 47 COVID-19 case and fatality counts for a wide range of countries and regions. 48 We find that the cumulative number of fatalities within a given period of a few 49 weeks before the peak number of daily fatalities increases by 30% for the same period 50 after the peak. Strikingly, this result is found to hold universally across all considered 51 countries and regions. In contrast to the universality with regard to the increase in 52 fatalities, substantial differences in the country-specific intrinsic reproduction factor and 53 short and long-term control parameters are found. A comprehensive theoretical 54 description based on an analytic solution of the controlled SIR model is given, together 55 with a detailed validation (based on simulated data) of the statistical inference used for 56 estimation of the country specific parameters.

Of interest is, in this regard, whether the average medical 190 load decreases or increase after the peak of the outbreak has been reached, in particular 191 when averaged over a timescale T \u03c4 of several weeks. 192 We denote with F before , and respectively with F after , the number of deaths occurring 193 in the T \u03c4 days before/after daily fatalities peaked, \u2206F peak = I(X peak )/f F , as 194 determined by Eqs.

As a measure we compare the cumulative number of fatalities over two 397 periods of identical length, typically several weeks, just before and just after the peak of 398 the first wave. In this regard, we find that the medical load increases on the average by 399 33% after the peak. This is quite a remarkable observation, in our view, given that the 400 Covid-19 outbreaks vary substantially in between countries.",
