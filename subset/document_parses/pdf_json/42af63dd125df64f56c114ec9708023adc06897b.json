            "text": "Adolescence is one of the most important developmental periods, during which a person matures physically, cognitively, mentally, emotionally, and socially [1] . Vulnerability and specific characteristics of their age group place adolescents at higher risk when they engage in behaviors such as sexual risk, peer violence, tobacco, alcohol, illicit substance use, and gambling. Youth gambling is a frequent risk behaviour of adolescents in Croatia, where the study presented in this paper was conducted. It was found that 72.9% of Croatian adolescents had at least one experience with gambling in their lifetime [2] . A recent metaanalysis of 44 studies on youth gambling [3] showed that 0.2-12.3% of young people met the criteria for problematic gambling. Compared with other European countries, the highest rate of youth gambling (12.3%) was found in Croatia. At the time of this work, more than three quarters of 16-year-old adolescents (79%) had consumed alcohol in the last year, with almost half (47%) of those having done so in the last month [4] Regarding the consumption of illegal drugs, Croatia was above the European average, with 21% of adolescents stating that they had consumed drugs at least once. High-risk marijuana use among students was also above the European average, with 4.7% of students at risk of developing cannabisrelated problems [4] . The results related to the use of inhalants showed that Croatia was at the very top of European countries, with 15% of students having consumed such products Adolescents who were less connected to school were involved in gambling activities to a higher extent [31] and experienced more socio-emotional harm [39] . In one study [3] , negative associations were found between school achievement and problem gambling, including truancy, difficulty in school, decreased academic performance, and school dropout. Many studies found that school attachment and school commitment were negatively associated with substance use [40] [41] [42] . Better relationships with peers, a stronger attachment to school, and higher academic achievement were negatively associated with smoking [43] . Adolescents who had strong bonds to school were less likely to report nonmedical use of prescription drugs [44] . Promoting school attachment, particularly during the middle school years, can be protective in preventing early substance use [45] . School bonding degree reported by students, a positive relationship with school, school satisfaction, and belonging were found to be negatively associated with violent behavior [46] [47] [48] . School disengagement-measured on standardized test scores, attendance, failing core courses, suspensions, and grade retention-was found to be related to higher levels of violent behavior during adolescence and early adulthood [49] . In their study with adolescents, Peterson and colleagues [50] found that reduced sexual risk behavior was associated with several school protective factors such as school commitment, belonging, relationships, and participation. Good relationships with teachers and stronger student-level commitment were significantly associated with decreased odds of sexual debut at the 24-month follow-up. In this study, baseline students who reported higher commitment to learning were less likely to report sexual debut at the 36-month follow-up. Students who had stronger relationships with teachers were less likely to report sexual debut at 36 months. They were also less likely to report a failure to use contraception if they were sexually active.",

In this and some previous studies, family satisfaction was operationalized as the satisfaction with the level of family functioning, i.e., the degree of student satisfaction with the level of support they receive, the ways in which family problems are solved, the quality of time spent together, and the degree of independence within the family [51] . School attachment referred to students' emotional attachment to school, while school commitment reflected students' efforts invested and success achieved in school tasks [52, 53] .",

            "text": "Structural equation modeling (SEM) [61, 62] was employed to test for the associations between school and family factors and risk behaviors. SEM is particularly suited to this task because it uses latent variables based on multiple observed variables for each construct. In this way, all available indicators of each construct can be used simultaneously in a specific factor structure, and associations between constructs are estimated in the context of these specified factors. This affords the advantage of being able to examine the validity of both the measurement model and the structural model in the same analysis. It also avoids problems associated with creating scale summary scores, which obscure relevant psychometric properties. Missing data were handled, in the context of model estimation, by using full information maximum likelihood estimation (FIML) in Mplus version 8.4 [63] . Figure 1 presents the hypothesized model, in which school protective factor (school attachment and school commitment) and family protective factor (family communication and family satisfaction) latent variables were associated with gambling, substance use, violence, and sexual risk behavior. Rectangles represent observed variables, while circles represent latent constructs. Data analyses were conducted in two sets: first, using the full sample (female n = 5086, male n = 4594), and then on the subsample (excluding Zagreb), for which there was data on sexual risk behavior (female n = 2760, male n = 2469). In each case, the measurement models were tested first, and structural models were estimated based on the successful estimation of the measurement models. Multigroup models were specified a priori, allowing all parameters to vary between groups (female, male). Model fit was assessed using model root-mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) and standardized root mean square residual (SRMR), as well as a test of close fit (the probability that RMSEA is below 0.05). Comparative fit was evaluated using the comparative fit index (CFI) and Tucker-Lewis index (TLI). Based on previously published results [64] , the measurement models were specified with all of the latent constructs, allowing covariances and residual covariances among several scale variables to be freely estimated.",

Previous studies were predominantly focused on examining the relationship between family communication and alcohol and substance use among young people. These studies showed that the quality of family communication played a significant role in decreasing substance use [23, 28] and binge drinking [75, 76] among youth. However, these studies were conducted with preadolescents whose age was lower than the age of a sample in our study. A study conducted with adolescents whose mean age was closer to the one in our sample (mean age = 15.1 years) showed that communication with parents did not predict alcohol or drug use, but was associated with academic motivation and peers, which were associated with substance use. According to the authors of that study [77] , communication with parents may have an indirect role in alcohol and drug use, by influencing adolescents' academic motivation and choice of friends. During adolescence, young people are developing autonomy from their parents so their peers become a significant source of social and emotional support [78] , which makes peer relationships very influential during this life period.",

A study that aimed to assess the relationships between parenting styles, parents' attitudes toward gambling, and frequency of parents' gambling and frequency of their sons' gambling showed that a certain number of male adolescents participated in gambling activities together with their fathers [80] . The same study showed that there was a significant relationship between permissive parenting style and adolescent gambling. For some adolescents, having permissive parents might increase their satisfaction with their family life since it gives them a lot of freedom. Further research is needed to understand this relationship between family life satisfaction and gambling activities of adolescents.",

At 36-month follow-up, baseline students who reported stronger relationships with teachers were less likely to report sexual debut at 36 months, and less likely to report a failure to use contraception if they were sexually active. Associations involving participation and contraception use were largely nonsignificant in the described study.

First, because of the cross-sectional study design, the causal relations among observed protective factors and gambling, violence, substance use, and sexual risk behavior could not be examined. In order to examine the directionality of these relations, future longitudinal studies are needed. Additionally, the data were collected exclusively using the method of self-assessment. As some questions were focused on assessing participation in risk behaviors, it is possible that some adolescents gave socially desirable answers, given the sensitivity of the question. Additional assessments gained from teachers, parents and/or peers might have provided more accurate insights. The study measures were extracted from a comprehensive set of measures used with students which measured many different constructs and behaviors. For that reason, sexual risk behavior and violence were each assessed with only two items. Having comprehensive scales to measure these behaviors would make the findings of this study stronger. It is important to note that this research was conducted before the beginning of the COVID-19 virus pandemic, which significantly affected the modalities of teaching and social interaction of high school students. It is very likely that these circumstances could have influenced family and school context characteristics. The occurrence of risk behaviors of adolescents would be worth exploring in post-COVID-19 circumstances.",

School attachment, i.e., students' emotional attachment to teachers and school, was negatively associated with gambling for both genders and with violence for male adolescents. In the subsample model, school attachment was also negatively associated with sexual risk behavior for males. In this study, school commitment, i.e., students' efforts invested and success achieved in school tasks, was negatively associated with gambling, substance use, and violence for both genders. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [73] suggested several strategies to promote adolescents' school connectedness, i.e., the belief (by students) that adults and peers in the school care about their learning as well as about them as individuals. These were: (1) creating decision-making processes that facilitate student, family, and community engagement, academic achievement, and staff empowerment; (2) providing education and opportunities to enable families to be actively involved in children's' academic and school life; (3) providing students with the academic, emotional, and social skills necessary to be actively engaged in school; (4) using effective classroom management and teaching methods to foster a positive learning environment; (5) providing professional development and support for teachers and other school staff to enable them to meet the diverse cognitive, emotional, and social needs of children and adolescents; (6) creating trusting and caring relationships that promote open communication among administrators, teachers, staff, students, families, and communities.",
