            "text": "Although the role of social media in infectious disease outbreaks is receiving increasing attention, little is known about the mechanisms by which social media use affects risk perception and preventive behaviors during such outbreaks. This study aims to determine whether there are any relationships between social media use, preventive behavior, perceived threat of coronavirus, self-efficacy, and socio-demographic characteristics. The data were collected from 310 respondents across Pakistan using an online cross-sectional survey. Reliability analyses were performed for all scales and structural equational modeling was used to identify the relationships between study variables. We found that: (i) social media use predicts self-efficacy (\u03b2 = 0.25, p < 0.05) and perceived threat of coronavirus (\u03b2 = 0.54, p < 0.05, R 2 = 0.06), and (ii) preventive behavior is predicted by self-efficacy and perceived threat of coronavirus (R = 0.10, p < 0.05). Therefore, these results indicate the importance of social media's influence on health-related behaviors. These findings are valuable for health administrators, governments, policymakers, and social scientists, specifically for individuals whose situations are similar to those in Pakistan.",

Up to mid-May 2021, the COVID-19 pandemic has had devastating consequences, with more than 161 million confirmed cases and more than 3.35 million deaths globally (World Health Organization, 2021) . In a severe public health emergency like this, people seek information from all available sources-including traditional media, interpersonal communication, and social media (Perez-Lugo, 2004) . For instance, traditional media play an important role in mobilizing the community, providing authoritative information and emotional support, helping isolated people feel connected, and allocating resources (Wicke and Silver, 2009 ). In such circumstances, people seek information from the media in order to understand the severity of the situation, and to protect themselves (Heath and Gay, 1997) . As different forms and degrees of lockdown measures were imposed to control the coronavirus outbreak (Marzouki et al., 2021) , there was very limited face-to-face contact . Thus, people have had to rely much more heavily on social media to keep informed and stay connected (Liu, 2021) . Consequently, social media usage has escalated, and it has quickly established itself as a critical medium of communication for information generation, distribution, and consumption (Effenberger et al., 2020; Fischer, 2020) . Compared to conventional media (electronic and print), social media allows for quick and easy access to information, making its impact more effective than ever (Cuello-Garcia et al., 2020) . Scholars have also studied the influential mechanism of health risk information on social media on individual cognition, attitudes, and actions (Lin et al., 2020) .",

Although some people follow the rules strictly, others neglect or postpone them and congregate in large groups in public areas or in their homes (Nofal et al., 2020) .

            "text": "Previous studies have shown that people have preferred social media platforms over traditional media to obtain diseaserelated information in recent infectious disease outbreaks (Jang and Baek, 2019) . During the H1N1 outbreak in 2009, people relied on Twitter (Chew and Eysenbach, 2010) and Facebook groups (Davies, 2009 ) for the exchange of information, opinions, and experiences. The public was also somewhat dependent on social media platforms to access and share MERS-related information in 2015 (Jang and Baek, 2019) . But in the case of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, social media use has reached unprecedented levels compared to the pre-pandemic period. People may be using social media during coronaled social distancing for stress relief and with the aim of accessing entertaining content, such as movies, comedies, and communication with family and friends (Whiting and Williams, 2013) . As work and schooling have been transferred to an onlinebased format, people are also spending a lot of time using social media to meet their professional and educational needs (Prem et al., 2020) . However, social media has become more significant as these platforms have emerged as a useful medium to disseminate health messages and contribute to the betterment of psycho-behavioral responses to Studies indicate that people primarily use social media, rather than other media outlets, to access information related to the coronavirus pandemic. As a result, social media platforms have been utilized for maintaining quarantine, alerting the public about high-risk areas, and providing awareness about health maintenance and treatments (Chan et al., 2020) . Moreover, empirical evidence shows that the use of social media as an information-seeking platform has altered preventive behavior related to coronavirus. The results of these studies are consistent with previous research on the function of social media in improving health-related preventive behaviors during pandemic situations (Shi and Smith, 2016; Yoo et al., 2016) . However, more scientific research is needed to explore the critical role of social media in coronavirus prevention and treatment. Since individual disease prevention behavior is the only known way to avoid the spread of COVID-19 (Ning et al., 2020) , it is critical to recognize the factors, along with social media use, that motivate individuals to participate in disease prevention behavior. This study aims to examine how social media has played an essential role in formulating preventive behavior during the COVID-19 outbreak in Pakistan.",

In this pandemic situation, the government should use social media to provide therapy to people in order to improve their mental health and coping skills (Nisar and Shafiq, 2019) .

Individuals' beliefs about their capabilities influence their behavior, such as what they choose to do or how they respond, in order to effectively manage situations (Bandura, 1997) .

The Pearson correlation coefficient was calculated to investigate the roles of age and income in explaining perceived threats related to the coronavirus, preventive behavior, and social media use. Based upon previous research conducted to predict preventive behavior during infectious disease outbreaks (Yoo et al., 2016) , we performed structural equation modeling (SEM). We combined exploratory factor analysis and multiple regression as a confirmatory technique to investigate the relationship between the dependent variable (preventive behavior), independent variable (social media use), and mediating variables (perceived threat related to the coronavirus and self-efficacy). The significance level was assigned at 95% for all tests. Table 2 presents the sociodemographic characteristics of the sample. Of the 310 respondents, slightly more than half were women (54.2%, n = 168) and the majority were unmarried (72.3%, n = 224). More than half of the participants were students (56.1%, n = 174), leading to an overall young sample. The majority had a combined family income of less than or equal to PKR 100,000 (74.5%, n = 231). A considerable number of respondents used social media for more than 4 h a day (42.3%, n = 131), and more than half of the participants (59.4%, n = 184) relied on social media for information about COVID-19.",

            "text": "The COVID-19 pandemic has permanently altered the global landscape. The crippling consequences of the lockdown have been felt in all spheres of life (Bae et al., 2021) , including a crumbling health system (Miller et al., 2020; Mahmood et al., 2021) , panic buying (Ahmad and Murad, 2020; Arafat et al., 2020) , a severe and difficult-to-resolve economic and labor crisis (Sukharev, 2020) , high levels of distress (Cullen et al., 2020) , and so on. Both the short-term and long-term effects of the COVID-19 pandemic have influenced how people view and represent current events and future scenarios, including adherence to preventive behavior (Liu, 2021) . This research aims to advance our understanding of how social media shapes public perceptions of threat and their involvement in preventive behaviors by analyzing data collected during the COVID-19 outbreak in Pakistan in 2020. According to the results, more than half of the participants used social media to learn about COVID-19. This finding corroborates the findings of previous research looking at how people search for and share information during epidemics (Sharma et al., 2017) . People's use of social media to exchange information about their opinions and activities continues to increase in popularity (Vitak et al., 2011) . Social media may be well-suited for individuals to share their opinions and views on particular health issues due to the affordances offered by social media platforms. Users of social media may find satisfaction in purposefully expressing themselves on these platforms (Fogg and Iizawa, 2008) . The unexpected and deadly COVID-19 pandemic has prompted an increasing number of studies on its effects, especially on risk perception, with the goal of providing useful information for future health-related communication strategies (Liu, 2021; Oh et al., 2021) . The results show that social media use is linked to perceived threat and self-efficacy, both of which are associated with coronavirus preventive behavior. In the situation of infectious disease outbreaks, social media has grown in importance as a risk and crisis coordination tool (Strekalova, 2017; Lwin et al., 2018) . Information seeking and sharing through social media can complicate disease communication, as emotions can influence both public perceptions and behavior related to infectious diseases (Apuke and Omar, 2021; Dadaczynski et al., 2021; Soroya et al., 2021) . In the literature, the dynamics between social media use, affective responses, risk perception, and behavioral outcomes have been discussed (Karasneh et al., 2021) . The findings revealed that people's perceptions of the COVID-19 threat were high, and that most people took selfpreventive measures and believed they were helpful. This study explains the emotional and cognitive mechanisms that affect people's threat perceptions and preventive behaviors as a result of information available on social media. The researchers (Liu, 2021) also found that social media plays a role in fostering preventive behaviors by inducing fear, which influences people's risk perceptions. In China, it is reported that people were exposed to COVID-19-related information through a variety of social media platforms, which had a positive impact on preventive behaviors . In another study, it is concluded that the large amount of COVID-19 information made available via social media was linked to the public's understanding of their susceptibility to and the severity of COVID-19 infections, as well as their subsequent involvement in COVID-19 prevention behaviors (Lin et al., 2020) . The use of social media as a communication tool during an infectious disease epidemic is a novel form of observation, but it offers a possible source of reliable and timely assessments of disease development within populations (Nazir et al., 2020) .",

Future researchers could investigate other factors related to social media use, such as psychological stress, family relationships, social isolation, and loneliness.

This study adds to the growing body of knowledge revealing that using social media to disseminate COVID-19 information can influence audiences' perceptions of perceived threat and self-efficacy, as well as their preventive behavior. This means that social media can be used as part of public health communication during outbreaks. Official social media pages for experts and health agencies could share timely and important information with the public, potentially counteracting the negative impacts of other types of media sharing.",
