            "text": "The greatest challenge the world is facing today is to win the battle against COVID-19 pandemic as soon as possible. Until a vaccine is available, personal protection, social distancing, and disinfection are the main tools against SARS-CoV-2. Although it is quite infectious, the SARS-CoV-2 virus itself is an enveloped virus that is relatively fragile because its protective fatty layer is sensitive to heat, ultraviolet radiation, and certain chemicals. However, heat and liquid treatments can damage some materials, and ultraviolet light is not efficient in shaded areas, so other disinfection alternatives are required to allow safe re-utilization of materials and spaces. As of this writing, evidences are still accumulating for the use of ozone gas as a disinfectant for sanitary materials and ambient disinfection in indoor areas. This paper reviews the most relevant results of virus disinfection by the application of gaseous ozone. The review covers disinfection treatments of both air and surfaces carried out in different volumes, which varies from small boxes and controlled chambers to larger rooms, as a base to develop future ozone protocols against COVID-19. Published papers have been critically analyzed to evaluate trends in the required ozone dosages, as a function of relative humidity (RH), contact time, and viral strains. The data have been classified depending on the disinfection objective and the volume and type of the experimental set-up. Based on these data, conservative dosages and times to inactivate the SARS-CoV-2 are estimated. In small chambers, 10-20 mg ozone/m 3 over 10 to 50 min can be sufficient to significantly reduce the virus load of personal protection equipment. In large rooms, 30 to 50 mg ozone/m 3 would be required for treatments of 20-30 min. Maximum antiviral activity of ozone is achieved at high humidity, while the same ozone concentrations under low RH could result inefficient. At these ozone levels, safety protocols must be strictly followed. These data can be used for reducing significantly the viral load although for assuring a safe disinfection, the effective dosages under different conditions need to be confirmed with experimental data.",

            "text": "SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the coronavirus family and causes illnesses ranging from those similar to that of the common cold to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) . It belongs to the Betacoronavirus genera in the family Coronaviridae of the order Nidovirales, and it is classified in Group IV according to the Baltimore classification. This group is characterized by having a positive single-stranded RNA. The genomic similarity to SARS-like coronaviruses obtained from bats is almost 90% and amino acid similarity to SARS 2003 and SARS-CoV-1 is almost 80%, which suggests that lessons learned from previous SARS outbreaks might be applied with Responsible Editor: Philippe Garrigues * Angeles Blanco ablanco@ucm.es caution until new data become available (Wu et al. 2020) . As an enveloped virus, the virion, or the form the virus takes when outside the body, is wrapped in a fatty layer to protect it during transmission. If the envelope is damaged or dried out, the virus will die. Since this layer is sensitive to heat, detergents, solvents, and oxidants, the virus is relatively delicate to the external environment. This weakness has been used to control it (Swilling 2015) . The incubation period for humans is around 4 days (usually between 2 and 7 days). The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever and dry cough. Symptoms do not usually appear for a period ranging from 2 to 14 days or more, during which the asymptomatic patient is contagious (Guan et al. 2020) . Indeed, it has been shown that between 5 and 80% of people with positive SARS-CoV-2 test may be totally asymptomatic, particularly so in children and young adults. This has been one of the main difficulties in controlling the pandemic (Oxford 2020).",

            "text": "Nowadays, it is recognized that potential mode of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is aerosols and formites. The survival time of the SARS-CoV-2 virus depends on the environment. Existing evidence suggests that airborne transmission, particularly via nascent aerosols from human atomization, is very rapid and is a dominant route for the transmission of this disease, as was also the case in SARS-CoV-1 . SARS-CoV-2 virus levels were as high as 67,164 copies/m 3 in the air of hospital environments housing COVID-19 patients (Yao et al. 2020) . Due to the possible build-up of the airborne virus-carrying droplets, the stability of the virus in indoor air is critical (Morawska and Cao 2020; Riddell et al. 2020 ). SARS-CoV-2 is stable for a period varying from several hours to several days in aerosols and on surfaces. The virus survives 3 h in aerosols, 4 h on copper, 24 h on porous surfaces such as cardboard, 48 h on stainless steel, and 72 h on plastic (Van Doremalen et al. 2020) . These preliminary figures are, in general, lower than the 4-5 days estimated for the SARS-CoV-1 survival in metal, wood, and paper (Kampf et al. 2020) . Recently, viable SARS-CoV-2 has been isolated after 7 days on surgical masks by Chin et al. (2020) and after 28 days from common non-porous surfaces (glass, stainless steel, banknotes) at ambient temperature and humidity by Riddell et al. (2020) . Increasing the temperature drastically reduced the survivability of the virus to as little as 24 h at 40\u00b0C.",

Because of this, it is now recognized that disinfection is more essential than ever. Until a vaccine is developed and/or a large portion of the population has been infected, to prevent SARS-CoV-2 virus spread, it is necessary to (1) remove the virus-laden droplets and aerosols from indoor air by ventilation or (2) inactivate or kill the virus, whether airborne or on surfaces, with adequate treatments. Protocols for indoor environment disinfections of public places have been adapted and are continuously under review, but fast effective disinfection alternatives are still necessary for a safe resumption of usual business. Since the International Labour Organization estimates that 195 million jobs are at risk, best available disinfection protocols are being applied, in the first instance for health care facilities, nursing homes, hotels, and public transport, as well as for shops, offices, schools, restaurants, cruise ships, cinemas, etc., to minimize the socio-economic crisis. However, new outbreaks are arising after these practices have been adopted and, therefore, more efficient disinfection protocols are demanded to help to defeat the coronavirus.",

The lack of PPE represents a safety problem for health care workers and has resulted in a high number of them being infected. This situation is still happening in many regions, and it could recur in Europe if a larger wave returns. Accordingly, immediate solutions to extend the life of PPE and reuse them in a safe way have become essential to prepare against new shortages. Most of the small number of published works on disinfection of PPE and similar materials study the use of liquid chemicals, heat, or ultraviolet light (Ludwig-Begall et al. 2020 ), but all these methods present different drawbacks. For example, liquid treatments require a drying time, and residual products may produce skin irritation; some medical materials are heat or liquid sensitive; and ultraviolet light is not efficient in complex materials with areas in the shadow. Thus, the use of ozone gas has been proposed (Hudson et al. 2007; Lee et al. 2020) since it can easily penetrate to most areas and surfaces that require disinfection.",

It has been widely used for water disinfection during the last century, and it is considered as one of the best biocides against microorganisms by the World Health Organization. Aqueous solutions of ozone are in use as disinfectants in many commercial situations, including wastewater treatment, laundries, and food processing, but the use of the gas itself is still under study. Ozone is very reactive and, as a consequence, is unstable. Residual ozone molecules break down naturally to oxygen with a half-life of 20-30 min at 30\u00b0C (Hudson et al. 2009 ). Because of this, ozone must be produced and used in situ. It is easily generated from oxygen or air by ozone generators. Since 2013, it has been included in the EU Biocidal Products list and controlled by the 528/2012 Regulation. Thus, the active substance ozone and the ozone-generating equipment need to be authorized to be used in Europe (ECHA 2020). Ozone as active substance was authorized in 2016 while, according to article 93, in situ production of ozone for different uses is under review and subjected to national laws pending the final decision on its approval. In other countries like Japan, ozone was introduced in 2008, as part of the measures to prevent the swine flu infection, and it was authorized to be used in main airports (Nara 2020).",

(2018) analyzed 20 years of influenza data in Hong Kong and demonstrated that when ambient ozone concentration level increased, the transmission ability of influenza viruses (H1N1, H3N2, and Influenza B) decreased substantially. With respect to COVID-19, Yao et al. (2020) have demonstrated that its transmission was negatively impacted by higher ambient average ozone level, higher temperature, and lower relative humidity. They found a statistically significant negative association between ozone levels (49-95 \u03bcg/ m 3 ) during Jan-March, 2020 and the confirmed number of COVID-19 cases. In general, a lower number of confirmed cases were observed when ozone level was higher than 73 \u03bcg/ m 3 . Although the association of ambient O 3 with reduced virus transmissibility may be related to the virucidal activity of O 3 and its effect on host defense, this result implies that these environmental parameters might be adjusted to mitigate the transmission of COVID-19. If these data are confirmed, low concentrations of ozone (\u2248 0.075 mg/m 3 ) could be used indoors to mitigate the transmissions (e.g., in hospitals and nursing homes). This approach has been also suggested in a recent press release from Nara University.",

            "text": "Ozone acts on a broad range of targets in viruses, including the viral capsid, specific viral attachment epitopes into new cell hosts, and viral RNA (Torrey et al. 2019) . It may inactivate viruses by both diffusing through the protein coat into the nucleic acid core, resulting in damage of the viral RNA, and by disrupting the exterior protein layer by oxidation. However, little attention has been given to elucidate the mechanism of virus inactivation by ozone, and the few published studies are focused on using aqueous solution of ozone. Katzenelson et al. (1978) reported a two-stage ozone inactivation curve of poliovirus type 1 when it was treated with ozonized water. They demonstrated a dose-response relationship between ozone and the inactivation ability. At a dosage of 1.24 mg/L, in the first fast stage, 99% of the viruses were inactivated in seconds, whereas the remainder of the viruses were killed during the second stage, which continues for several minutes. In 1981, Roy et al. associated this result with a change in the polypeptide structure of the protein coat although it did not cause disintegration of the viral particles. The reduced attachment could not account for the high percentage of inactivation obtained for a low residual concentration of ozone (0.3 mg/L with a contact time up to 2 min). Therefore, the major cause of inactivation was attributed in this case to RNA damage where the diffusion of ozone through the protein coat is the limiting step for ozonized water treatments. Ozone in water may act directly and through radicals while ozone gas acts only directly so the kinetics will be different. Mechanisms of virus inactivation by ozone gas are not available, but they would be useful in developing ozone disinfection processes.",

            "text": "Although there is a significant potential for ozone against SARS-CoV-2, it is a toxic compound, and risks and consequences of exposure of people to ozone gas has led to restrictions in its use. The efficiency of ozone depends on the total dosage, the concentration, the treatment time, the type of virus, and the environmental conditions (temperature and RH) (Dennis et al. 2020) . It is important to note that the concentrations required for disinfection are several magnitudes higher than the exposure limits defined for Occupational Safety and Health regulations (OSHA 2020). In general, the limits for workers are < 0.1 ppm or 0.2 mg/m 3 as average in 8 h; < 0.3 ppm if exposure time is only 15 min; and if the concentration is > 0.3 ppm, a PPE is needed. In practice, this is overcome by ensuring that the area to be treated is closed to people and sealed. After treatment, which includes a decay time that varies depending on total dose and environmental condition, the area should be well ventilated. An improvement of this treatment could be achieved by combining ozone with UV irradiation which could result in the need of lower dosages and times. On the other hand, faster residual ozone removal can be achieved by using adsorbents and/or catalytic and heat converters.",

These face masks are commonly composed of high-performance polymers and composites, such as non-woven polypropylene fiber, which allow its use under oxidizing atmospheres. Manning et al. (2020) proved that the exposure of N95 respirators, types 1860, 1870 and 8000, to ozone at 400 ppm for 2 h and 10 cycles did not show significant changes in filtration efficiency nor integrity and that it was safe for PPR reuse. Nevertheless, gaseous ozone is an extremely oxidizing agent, and severe effects can be observed when ozone is applied to devices made of natural rubber or derived composites (Lewis 2016) . Composites of this natural polymer can be found in light, flexible, and resistant products, like high-performance nonflammable clothes (straps, boots), gloves, or some mattresses.",

The first step is the suspension of target viruses into water. After that, viral suspensions are aerosolized in the controlled chambers by using different devices including collision three-jet nebulizers (Tseng and Li 2006) , collision six-jet nebulizers (Dubuis et al. 2020) , and electric hot foggers (Pekovic and Kacimi 2015) . The ozonation process takes place right after the aerosols are sprayed all over the indoor air environment. When the test is performed in small chambers, ozone is dosed through direct injection from a small tube because of the ease of diffusion all over the treated volume (Tseng and Li 2006; Dubuis et al. 2020 ). If the ozonated volume is a large room, the ozone generator is placed in the center of the room to allow access to the entire air volume, and it is dispersed by the use of fans (Pekovic and Kacimi 2015; Hudson et al. 2009 ). To confirm the effect of ozone disinfection, a control experiment is always performed by adding aerosolized viral suspensions to air without ozone treatment. Sampling process requires the use of impactors or samplers that collect microparticles of aerosols (around 1-1.2 \u03bcm of particle size) which obtain controlled air volume samples before and after the treatment Li 2006, Dubuis et al. 2020) .",

On the other hand, Dubuis et al. have treated airborne norovirus with ozone, in a controlled chamber, under high RH conditions, low ozone concentration (0.46 mg/m 3 or 0.23 ppm), and 40 min of contact time (Dubuis et al. 2020 ). The reduction of murine norovirus infectivity was as high as 99.8%. This fact shows that a large reduction of infectivity can be achieved treating the atmosphere with aerosolized norovirus even when the concentration of ozone is as low as 0.46 mg/m 3 when the RH is as high as 85%. Therefore, Fig. 1 Ozone concentrations and contact times required for 99% viral inactivation in low-volume spaces. Virus of Group IV is underlined and marked in red Environ Sci Pollut Res considering the similitude between SARS-CoV-2 and murine norovirus, one might expect, from Fig. 1 , that TC doses of 20 mg/m 3 min could be efficient for SARS-CoV-2 under high RH conditions (this has to be confirmed by experimental studies). Lee et al. have shown, using a human coronavirus (HCoV-229E) as a surrogate for SARS-CoV-2, that the virus present on contaminated masks lost its infectivity to a human cell line (MRC-5) when exposed to 240 mg/m 3 ozone gas during 1 min. Similar results were obtained for influenza A virus (H1N1). In this case, this short exposure time did not fully degrade the viral RNA, and thus, the loss of infectivity was attributed to the damage of the viral envelope or envelope proteins, resulting in failure of the virus to attach itself to host cells (Lee et al. 2020) .",

Several viruses are in the same group as SARS-CoV-2 (Group IV): rhinovirus, poliovirus, murine coronavirus, sindbis virus, yellow fever virus, and feline calcivirus. The required contact time clearly depends on the RH. High contact time of 60 min is required when RH is 40% (typical value for a room or office is 40-60%) while at high RH (> 90%), 10-20 min is enough.

Ozonation of large spaces can be performed as said in 2.1 due to the fact that the aerosolization of extensive surfaces like walls, doors, or ceilings ensures the proper distribution of the viruses all over the studied surface, and the small size of drops and particles increases the contact area between ozone and the viral suspension on the surface (Pekovic and Kacimi 2015) . Other option is to prepare sterile strips of different materials (steel, glass, plastic) with viral suspensions films spread over the surface. These strips must be manipulated in sterile cabinets to avoid contamination. Once dried, they can be transported in sterile containers to the test room, where they are placed in selected places of the room (walls, beds, doors) to perform the ozonation treatment to disinfect. In this case, two control experiments are needed: one including some strips that stay at the safety cabinet during the entire experiment and another one which consists of some strips contained within sterile sealed boxes that are placed in the test room but are not exposed to ozone treatment (Hudson et al. 2009 ).",

The analyzed surfaces vary from inert materials like plastic (Tanaka et al. 2009 ) or stainless steel (Maier and Chu 2016) to microbiologically active surfaces like vegetables and fruit (Predmore et al. 2015; Bri\u00e9 et al. 2018; Zhou et al. 2018) or culture dishes (Lin et al. 2007 ). The most common steps in the ozone treatment are the following ones: firstly, the recovery of the lyophilized viral strains and the preparation of the viral suspension are necessary. Then, the viruses are applied to infect well-known bacterial strains, commonly guided and selected by a standard method. Once bacteria were inoculated, in all the cases, the Virus of Group IV is underlined and marked in red dispersion methodology was spotting or adding drop-wise until covering the entire extension of the ozonized area. In some cases, surface drying step before ozonation is also mentioned (Tanaka et al. 2009; Zhou et al. 2018) . Once finished, viruses are recovered through a specific treatment which depends on the surface and varies from sterilized water (Tanaka et al. 2009 ) to different extractives like phosphate-buffered solution (PBS) (Predmore et al. 2015; Lin et al. 2007) , vegetable buffer (Zhou et al. 2018) , or TGBE buffer (Bri\u00e9 et al. 2018 ). Viral quantification is performed by standard plaque assay method (Zhou et al. 2018) or viral titration, which means a quantitative assay of the infectivity of the virus recovered in monolayer cells of selected bacterial strains (Predmore et al. 2015; Lin et al. 2007; Bri\u00e9 et al. 2018; Tanaka et al. 2009 ). Other typical quantification methods mentioned by some researchers include reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), analysis of viral proteins, virus extraction (Bri\u00e9 et al. 2018; Predmore et al. 2015) , and cytokine measurement (Lin et al. 2007 ) quantification methods.",

Stainless steel surfaces of a cryostat treated for 120 min with 1.300 mg/m 3 of ozone achieved 5-log reductions of polyoma virus. Presumably, lower dosages and times could have been enough for a 99% reduction of virus load. Higher RH (> 90%) enhances the disinfection process, reducing the required ozone concentration and contact time. The best results of disinfection on inert materials are found when a controlled chamber is used, such as a culture dish and plastic carriers. The disinfection of a complete cryostat is difficult because this device has a large number of parts, and the ozone gets dispersed all over the equipment. As a result, it is difficult to achieve high concentrations of ozone in each part of the device, and the complete process needs 120 min.",

When using 40 mg/m 3 of ozone, RH higher than 50% is needed to reach significant reduction of the Influenza Virus A (99.99%) in face masks, and 80% of RH is needed to achieve the same yield in N95 and Tyvek. These disinfection processes were carried out during 90 min, in the case of Tyvek and face masks, and 18 min in the case of N95, meaning a total CT of 3.600 mg/m 3 min for face masks (RH = 62%) and Tyvek (RH = 80%) materials and a CT of 720 mg/m 3 min for N95 masks. Compared with the results of Tanaka et al. (2009) under similar RH conditions (60%), facemasks required a CT value three-times higher to reach similar reduction values. The main reason is that Blanchard et al. (2020) did not study times shorter than 90 min at 62% RH, but according to Tanaka, this time can be shorter. Recently, Clavo et al. (2020) in a study focussed on the total removal of the SARS-COV-2 have demmonstrated that the effect of ozone was highly dependent on the RH. Under 99% RH a dosage of 8-13 mg/m 3 during 30 min completely remove the virus from gown samples and highly reduced gene amplification in face masks. However, at 66% RH, the virus gene amplification was still detected after an exposure at 6-24 mg/m 3 during 50 min, although it was an important decrease in gene amplification.",

High ozone concentration experiments are carried out to achieve the maximum reduction in short exposure time.

A conservative approach could be to apply of 20 to 50 mg/ m 3 (10-25 ppm) of ozone during 20 to 30 min to achieve a high virus reduction on surfaces in short times. Thus, a TC of 400-1500 mg/m 3 min seems to be required which is lower than the 2400 mg/m 3 min determined by Tanaka et al. (2009) for a 99.9 reduction of the influenza virus. Low concentrations for a longer time could be applied when time is not a limiting factor, as in the case of ozonization treatments at night in public facilities such as health centers, nursery common rooms, schools, and this has already been suggested by Tanaka et al. (2009) .",

Long contact times (30-50 min) are required when > 99.99% of virus reduction is needed (TC = 900 mg/m 3 min), but lower dosages are enough for a significant viral load reduction (TC = 200 mg/m 3 min).
