In this paper we review the state of the art of cell engineering in the context of genome research, paying particular attention to what we can learn on naturally reduced genomes from either symbiotic or free living bacteria. Different minimal hypothetically viable cells can be defined on the basis of several computational and experimental approaches. Projects aiming at simplifying living cells converge with efforts to make synthetic genomes for minimal cells. The panorama of this particular view of synthetic biology lead us to consider the use of defined minimal cells to be applied in biomedical, bioremediation, or bioenergy application by taking advantage of existing naturally minimized cells.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Synthetic biology is neither a new science nor a clearly defined research program yet. Although recent years have witnessed great enthusiasm around the field, it is simply not true that 'synthetic biology' is a newly coined term. We must go to the beginning of the past century to find that the French biophysicist St\u00e9phane Leduc used this term in 1912 as the title of his book on what he thought was the synthesis of artificial life. Meanwhile, the German-American biochemist Jacques Loeb in 1906 defined the synthesis of life as the goal of biology (Pereto & Catala, 2007) . Moreover, synthetic biology can even be included in an older tradition of thinking that was introduced by Goethe when he pointed out on the intrinsic value of a better understanding of life from a holistic perspective rather than when approached by the more successful analytic one (Goethe, 1817 (Goethe, -1824 . Biology was dominated in the last century by the powerful analytic approach. The advent of genomics, with its avalanche of data, led us to consider again the possibility of a synthetic biology. The recent history of the discipline showed us that the notion of synthesis is not unique, and at least three different categories with different aims, meth-odologies and techniques can be distinguished: protocell creation, DNA-based device construction, and genomedriven cell engineering (see table 1 by O'Malley et al., 2008) . The aims of the 'protocell creation' approach are to construct viable approximations to cells and to understand the fundamental biological principles in general and the origin of life in particular. The aim of the 'device construction' approach is to apply the engineering principles to biology and to construct standardized biological devices. The 'cell engineering' approach pursues the synthesis of minimal but complete genomes and their insertion in cells to redesign and control metabolic processes.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 551, "end": 574, "text": "(Pereto & Catala, 2007)", "ref_id": "BIBREF63"}, {"start": 859, "end": 872, "text": "(Goethe, 1817", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 873, "end": 887, "text": "(Goethe, -1824", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1389, "end": 1411, "text": "O'Malley et al., 2008)", "ref_id": "BIBREF58"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1378, "end": 1385, "text": "table 1", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "In the present review, we focus on the genome-driven cell engineering view of synthetic biology and emphasize the value of learning about naturally reduced genomes as a tool to engineer synthetically reduced ones, based on the hypothesis that simplified cells should be easier to study and predictably manipulate.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "In a classical attempt to define a minimal cell, Morowitz (1992) proposed two kinds of ecologically dependent simplicity: (1) cells harboring a minimized metabolic network able to thrive heterotrophically in a chemically complex environment and (2) autotrophic cells that make the least demands on the environment (i.e. CO 2 , N 2 , and minerals) to self-construct and maintain all their biological components. Instances of cultivable bacteria of those two classes are found among Mycoplasmatales and Cyanobacteria, respectively. In terms of bacterial genome minimization in nature, all known cases to date are associated with very specific lifestyles linked to very stable environments: obligate symbiosis (either parasitic or mutualistic) and adaptation to narrow and unique ecological niches in free-living organisms. In both cases we find examples of heterotrophic or autotrophic metabolic modes establishing a sort of hierarchy of minimal life forms that expands Morowitz efforts ( Table 1 ). The reasons for the reductive evolution of these genomes are absolutely dependent on the need for particular genetic adaptations to their specific ecological niches. The reductive genome syndrome implies additional genomic changes such as a severe decrease in G1C content, the loss of mechanisms for DNA repair and recombination (but see the case of Nanoarchaeum equitans), and an increased evolutionary rate of the protein-coding genes. However, the changes undergone in cell size and shape do not follow a general rule.

With only 422 kb and just 362 protein-coding genes, its genome is about 200 kb smaller than the other three B. aphidicola sequenced strains (Perez-Brocal et al., 2006) . This dramatic genome reduction is due to the loss of most genes involved in the biosynthesis of nucleotides, cofactors, transporters, peptidoglycan, as well as all ATPase subunits.

Moreover, by simulating their respective environmental conditions, the authors modeled the evolution of the gene content in B. aphidicola and Wigglesworthia glossinidia (primary endosymbiont of the tsetse fly) with over 80% accuracy.

Their proposed minimal genome contains just 151 genes, 38 RNA genes plus 113 protein-coding genes needed for informational processes, but does not include genes for intermediate metabolism (e.g. lipid metabolism and glycolysis). Self-reproductive vesicles encapsulating the biological system defined by their minimal genome, and allowing transmembranous small molecule transport, would be in principle spontaneously generated by the addition of amphiphilic molecules to the environment (Szostak et al., 2001; Luisi, 2007; Mansy et al., 2008) , although much work has to be carried out on the biophysical properties of artificial vesicles with encapsulated materials.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 227, "end": 250, "text": "Forster & Church (2006)", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 832, "end": 854, "text": "(Szostak et al., 2001;", "ref_id": "BIBREF77"}, {"start": 855, "end": 867, "text": "Luisi, 2007;", "ref_id": "BIBREF46"}, {"start": 868, "end": 887, "text": "Mansy et al., 2008)", "ref_id": "BIBREF47"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Defining minimal cells: experimental and computational approaches"}, {"text": "This biochemically derived minimal gene-set is quite different from what has been proposed in the previously described approaches, but has the advantage of being completely composed by genes with well-defined functions, being designed by modules, and it allows a system-bysystem debugging to attain self-replication.

Although some challenges still need to be faced before the goal can be accomplished (i.e. appropriate genes for tRNA modification, replication of monomer DNA circles over byproducts, ribosome assembly under physiological conditions, efficiency of translation, control and integration of subsystems, and cosegregation of genes with their products), the in vitro plan to synthesize it is on its way (Forster & Church, 2007) , although on the basis of still unrealistic assumptions under the current technologies, like considering membranes as optional.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 948, "end": 972, "text": "(Forster & Church, 2007)", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Defining minimal cells: experimental and computational approaches"}, {"text": "One of the main goals of synthetic biology is the synthesis of a living cell, which will have a big impact both in biotechnology and in our basic understanding of modern living systems (Pereto & Catala, 2007) .

The top-down approach, also called genome-driving cell engineering (O'Malley et al., 2008) or minimal cell project (Luisi, 2007) , starts from simple modern organisms and pretends to simplify them further through the removal of nonessential genetic elements. On the other side, the bottom-up approach attempts the synthesis of artificial minimal cells, component by component (Deamer, 2005; Forster & Church, 2006) . While this second approach implies that, once the defined composition of a minimal genome has been envisaged, the next step would be to synthesize the genome that contains the required genetic information, the simplification of extant genomes can be performed both, by synthesizing whole near-minimal genomes, or by deletion of the nonessential parts of larger ones.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 185, "end": 208, "text": "(Pereto & Catala, 2007)", "ref_id": "BIBREF63"}, {"start": 372, "end": 395, "text": "(O'Malley et al., 2008)", "ref_id": "BIBREF58"}, {"start": 420, "end": 433, "text": "(Luisi, 2007)", "ref_id": "BIBREF46"}, {"start": 681, "end": 695, "text": "(Deamer, 2005;", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 696, "end": 719, "text": "Forster & Church, 2006)", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Synthetic genomes for minimal cells"}, {"text": "Experimental genome reduction strategies have been extensively used in the past few years with several model and biotechnologically useful microorganisms, in order to learn about genome architecture and improve their characteristics (reviewed by F\u00e9her et al., 2007) . There are different ways to force a cellular population to go through a genomereductive process (e.g. selection for faster replication, damaging some DNA repair systems, or forcing the cells to grow in nutrient-poor conditions and pass through population bottlenecks), but all of them are slow and highly unpredictable. Furthermore, there are no adequate protocols to select for smaller genomes and, due to the randomness of the process, it is quite difficult to identify the genomic location of the losses. It is, therefore, more convenient to use targeted approaches toward genome reduction. The minimization process can be accelerated using different experimental strategies, which include plasmid or linear DNA-mediated procedures, as well as the use of site-specific recombinases and transposons. Processes of minimization in the laboratory have been pursued with E. coli (Kolisnychenko et al., 2002; Yu et al., 2002; Fukiya et al., 2004; Hashimoto et al., 2005; Posfai et al., 2006; Mizoguchi et al., 2007) , B. subtilis (Westers et al., 2003; Ara et al., 2007; Morimoto et al., 2008) , Corynebacterium glutamicum (Suzuki et al., 2005a, b, c, d) , and M. genitalium (Glass et al., 2006) . Some of these targeted approaches, aiming at the careful deletion of selected presumably dispensable genome regions, produced reduced-genome cells displaying virtually unaffected physiological features, and some emergent beneficial properties (Westers et al., 2003; Posfai et al., 2006; Morimoto et al., 2008) . Surprisingly, many of the removed genes were considered essential in a massive transposon mutagenesis experimental study (Gerdes et al., 2003) . However, when more extensive deletions were generated to maximize the extent of genome reduction, the indiscriminative removal of large DNA fragments resulted in aberrant cell morphology and reduced growth rate (Hashimoto et al., 2005) . In fact, it can be considered that an artificially reduced genome accepts further reductions with growing pains, making difficult the task of determining if there is a minimal deletion core. Three issues are critical to understand why. First, redundancy might be only apparent. Second, each part of the genome is loosely connected with the rest, so that each part functions worse when contiguous parts are eliminated, and deleterious effects are normally incremental. Third, the mechanism of cell division is not yet completely understood. It seems that a bacterium uses the bulk of the chromosome to take some measurements as to where and when to initiate cell division (Yu & Margolin, 1999) .

However, the common set of legs (minimal deletion core) is zero, because no particular leg is essential if we eliminate them one by one. Proper function requires proper disposition of the four legs, and if it has only three then the chair has to readapt to the three legs' new disposition. Similarly, a simplified genome might require rebalancing due to the loose network connections that involve the whole genome. And we can go further: if we think on equilibrists or bicycles, they can also work on two-leg and even one-leg chairs (using wheels in movement we can limit the number of legs to just one). Similarly, under specific carefully selected conditions, genomes can be greatly simplified. We are convinced that a minimal cell is feasible in the long run, following an iterative procedure with deletion/adjustment/ deletion cycles.

Several correction procedures were designed to reduce the error rate, based on the use of photo-programmable micro-fluidic chips for oligonucleotide assembly (which also exploit the advantage of miniaturization to reduce material costs) (Tian et al., 2004) , by adding natural DNA mismatch repair proteins to detect DNA mismatches and discriminate between correct and incorrect sequences (Carr et al., 2004) or using a recursive method to generate error-free long DNA molecules form imperfect oligonucleotides (Linshiz et al., 2008) .

Plasmids are tools for genomic engineering, naturally exploited by bacteria to promote genetic exchange. We can use plasmids to tinker on genomes and even to try to produce minimal but functional genomes. In fact, BACs are nothing but F-derived plasmids, so that we can design BACs or BAC-like plasmids containing an oriT sequence and transfer them by conjugation to a cell devoid of its chromosome (a so-called maxicell) (Sancar et al., 1979; Belogurov et al., 1992; Heinemann & Ankenbauer, 1993) . Complete genomes, genome segments, or functional modules can be synthesized on a BAC platform and tested for function. Conjugation is a very promiscuous mechanism and it works perfectly with minimal cells. For instance, Prochlorococcus has been found to be a good recipient that can accept and stably inherit plasmid RSF1010 from Proteobacteria (Tolonen et al., 2006) . In addition, we have found that all genes essential on the recipient cell side for conjugation to take place are included on the minimal genome, as judged from results on plasmid conjugation using the 3906 mutants of the Keio collection (Baba et al., 2006) as recipients (D. P\u00e9rez-Mendoza, M.V. Mendiola & F. de la Cruz, submitted). Synthetic biology has one of its main focuses on technological applications. The research program on minimal cells should be considered, although not exclusively, with the same applied orientation.

Let us consider a few examples. Engineered mycoplasma with further-reduced genomes might be appropriate living vectors for the introduction of new genetic circuits designed to fight against human diseases; selected soil bacteria may be appropriate vessels where to implement and/or to modify genetic circuits for bioremediation, while particular cyanobacteria could be useful for H 2 production or CO 2 sequestration.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 503, "end": 524, "text": "(Sancar et al., 1979;", "ref_id": "BIBREF68"}, {"start": 525, "end": 548, "text": "Belogurov et al., 1992;", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 549, "end": 578, "text": "Heinemann & Ankenbauer, 1993)", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 926, "end": 948, "text": "(Tolonen et al., 2006)", "ref_id": "BIBREF80"}, {"start": 1188, "end": 1207, "text": "(Baba et al., 2006)", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Concluding remarks: synthetic engineering of minimal cells"}, {"text": "Finally, we would like to end with a reference to ethical and safety issues.
