Here, we annotated 94 ripening-associated metabolites from the pulp of durian cv. Monthong fruit at unripe and ripe stages, using capillary electrophoresis-and gas chromatographytime-of-flight mass spectrometry, specifically focusing on taste-related metabolites. During ripening, sucrose content increased. Change in raffinose-family oligosaccharides are reported herein for the first time. The malate and succinate contents increased, while those of citrate, an abundant organic acid, were unchanged. Notably, most amino acids increased, including isoleucine, leucine, and valine, whereas aspartate decreased, and glutamate was unchanged. Furthermore, transcriptomic analysis was performed to analyze the dynamic changes in sugar metabolism, glycolysis, TCA cycle, and amino acid pathways to identify key candidate genes. Taken together, our results elucidate the fundamental taste-related metabolism of durian, which can be exploited to develop durian metabolic and genetic markers in the future.",

Owing to the increasing demand for durian, the price and production of the fruit tend to increase every year. Durian is well known for its outstanding flavor, described as an overpowering sweet taste, with a sweet, fruity odor resulting from high contents of starch, sugar, and saturated fatty acids in the ripe pulp (Charoenkiatkul et al., 2018) . More interestingly, ripe durian pulp contains various bioactive compounds, including carotenoids, flavonoids, and polyphenols, which confer substantial antioxidant properties (Aziz and Jalil, 2019) , suggesting that consumption of durian may have potential health benefits. The ripening process contributes to the organoleptic properties of durian pulp.",

The climacteric fruits, including durians, are usually harvested at the commercial maturity stage. Afterward, the fruits undergo a postharvest ripening process, during which the rates of respiration and ethylene production increase dramatically. During this process, stored carbohydrates are broken down to sugars, and acidity is reduced alongside the increase in taste and aroma volatiles (Gao et al., 2020) . Moreover, modifications of amino acids and organic acids are linked with fruit aroma by acting as precursors for the biosynthesis of aroma-forming volatile compounds (Tieman et al., 2006) . Taken together, these modifications are the key contributors to fruit flavor.",

Metabolomics has been successfully used to identify primary metabolites, including sugars, organic acids, amino acids, and other related compounds, and to provide an understanding of the whole landscape of metabolic alteration during the development and ripening of fruits, such as peach, tomato, strawberry, and grape (Lombardo et al., 2011) . Moreover, metabolomics, coupled with transcriptomics, provides information on major metabolic networks and candidate genes controlling the underlying processes; integration of these data with genomics provides new insights into the major metabolic variations and their genetic and biochemical control during development. Such studies have widely been performed on tomato, a popular model fruit, and documented how breeding and genetic selection globally altered tomato fruit metabolite content (Zhu et al., 2018) .",

            "text": "Metabolic profiles of ripe durian pulp have been investigated using capillary electrophoresis-time of flight/mass spectrometry (CE-TOF/MS) (Pinsorn et al., 2018) . Cultivar-dependent metabolites associated with the sensory traits of durian fruit pulp, such as its odor-related (cysteine and leucine) and ripeningassociated (aminocyclopropane carboxylate) metabolites, are of utmost importance. In 2017, the draft genome of Durian zibethinus was first published, and genome data integrated with transcriptome data identified methionine-\u03b3-lyase as a key gene involved in controlling sulfur volatile compound production in durian pulp (Teh et al., 2017) . This result was consistent with previously identified odor-active compounds in durian pulp, such as methanethiol (Li et al., 2012) . Furthermore, volatile-aroma esters, such as ethyl (2S)-2-methylbutanoate and ethyl butanoate, were isolated in the study, but their related pathways have not been studied in durian. The genomic data led to further studies to better understand the durian ripening process. Subsequently, a genome-wide analysis of the Dof (DNA binding with one finger) transcription factor family identified 24 Dofs (DzDofs), among which 15 were expressed in the fruit pulp. Functional characterization of DzDof2.2 suggested that it exerts its effects on fruit ripening by regulating auxin biosynthesis and auxin-ethylene crosstalk (Khaksar et al., 2019) . In addition, a member of the auxin response factor (ARF) transcription factor family was identified, showing that DzARF2A mediates durian fruit ripening through transcriptional regulation of ethylene biosynthesis genes (Khaksar and Sirikantaramas, 2020) . In this regard, omics analyses can be powerful tools to improve our limited understanding of the mechanisms underlying the durian postharvest ripening process, especially the changes in primary metabolites. In this study, we performed metabolomics, including capillary electrophoresis (CE) and gas chromatography (GC) coupled with time-of-flight mass spectrometry (TOF/MS), and transcriptomics to elucidate the post-harvest ripeningassociated metabolic processes of the Monthong cultivar, the most widely cultivated durian in Thailand. Our findings provide comprehensive information on metabolic shifts during these stages. The identification of ripening-associated metabolites, which contribute to its unique flavors, and key candidate genes may be further exploited in durian breeding programs to develop cultivars with altered sensory characteristics or enhanced nutritional value.",

The three stages of the durian fruit used in this study are as follows: unripe, midripe, and ripe. For the unripe stage, the fruit was harvested at the commercially mature stage of 105 days after anthesis. The fruit at midripe and ripe stages were harvested at the commercially mature stage and kept at room temperature (28 \u2022 C) for postharvest ripening until reaching a firmness of 3.4 \u00b1 0.81 N (\u223c3 days after harvest) and 1.55 \u00b1 0.45 N (\u223c5 days after harvest), respectively (Khaksar et al., 2019) . At each stage, durian pulp was collected from the central seed of each locule, immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen, and ground into powder. The powder was either freeze-dried for CE-TOF/MS, GS-TOF/MS, and high-performance anionexchange chromatography with pulsed amperometric detection (HPAEC-PAD) analyses or stored at \u221280 \u2022 C for RNA extraction. Another seed from a different locule of the same fruit was used to analyze firmness, using a texture analyzer, to ensure that samples of the same stage from different cultivars were under identical conditions.",

            "text": "Durian pulp undergoes physiological changes during ripening, including slight yellowing of the pulp, during postharvest ripening (Supplementary Figure 1) . The total soluble solid (TSS) level of durian pulp increased significantly from the unripe stage (Supplementary Figure 2A) . The accumulation of TSS increases consistently with total sugar content but is negatively related to starch content (Ketsa and Daengkanit, 1998) relative to the sweetness of the ripe pulp. At the same time, the percentage of titratable acidity (%TA) did not change significantly during ripening. However, %TA tended to increase during durian ripening (Supplementary Figure 2B) . Titratable acidity refers to total acid contents inside the food 1 https://www.metaboanalyst.ca/ (Sadler and Murphy, 2010) , suggesting that the acidity of durian pulp does not change considerably as it ripens. The changes in the underlying mechanisms during the ripening process contribute to the durian fruit's characteristics. To study the alterations of primary metabolites in these related mechanisms, we performed metabolome analysis in durian cv. Monthong pulp at the unripe and ripe stages. CE-TOF/MS and GC-TOF/MS techniques were used for comprehensive analysis of primary metabolites, which identified 167 and 56 metabolites, respectively (Supplementary Table 2 ). Metabolites were further analyzed using the web-based tool MetaboAnalyst 5.0. PCA plots, showed the total variance of the CE-TOF/MS data was 63% from PC1 and 13.4% from PC2 ( Figure 1A) , while total variance of the GC-TOF/MS data was 60.6% from PC1 and 18% from PC2 ( Figure 1B) . According to these two PCA plots, unripe durian samples were clearly separated from the ripe groups in PC1. As expected, the results showed that ripening greatly influences metabolic changes at the biochemical level and leads to physiological changes, such as the increased flavor and softening of the edible ripe fruit. This phenomenon is likewise observed in other fruit species, such as peach strawberry, tomato, and grape (Carrari and Fernie, 2006; Lombardo et al., 2011) , which each constitute different fruit models. To obtain the relevant biological pathways, Metabolomic Pathway Analysis (MetPA) was used. CE-TOF/MS results indicated that of 59 enriched biological pathways identified by KEGG analysis, 29 metabolic pathways were perturbed (Supplementary Table 3 ), including central carbon pathways (glycolysis and TCA cycle) and several amino acid pathways ( Figure 1C) . Meanwhile, GC-TOF/MS results indicated that nine pathways were significantly impacted ( Figure 1D) , including starch and sugar metabolism, as well as some amino acid pathways that were previously found in the CE-TOF/MS analysis (Supplementary Table 3 ). These results demonstrated that primary metabolic pathways were significantly altered during durian ripening, which may involve in flavor precursor biosynthesis.",

Previously, sucrose, fructose, glucose, and maltose were increased in ripe durian pulp samples (Charoenkiatkul et al., 2018) . Using GC-TOF/MS, we confirmed that these four major sugars and a newly annotated sugar, raffinose, were significantly increased during ripening with the log 2 FC ranging between 1.16 and 4.84 (Figure 2) , while the newly annotated 1-kestose was unchanged. Since sugars were only annotated from GC-TOF/MS in this work, we applied HPAEC-PAD analysis to validate and confirm the result (Figure 3) . According to the results, the contents of all four major sugars agreed with GC-TOF/MS. However, the content of 1kestose was significantly increased, while the content of raffinose remained unchanged during the ripening period (Figure 3) . Disagreements between the two methods could be obtained when the concentrations in the samples were very low, as raffinose and 1-kestose were in this case. When using GC-MS, it is suggested that optimum derivatization and separation are needed before measuring sugars in each individual plant extract (F\u00fczfai et al., 2004) . Therefore, in our analysis, quantification by targeted HPAEC-PAD analysis is more reliable than the untargeted analysis, which can lead to the discovery of novel metabolites. Fruits can accumulate different types of sugars, but sucrose is the primary storage sugar in many fruits, such as melon, banana, peach, and strawberry (Yamaki, 2010) . Notably, durian pulp contains over 50% sucrose by dry weight (Figure 3) , FIGURE 3 | Soluble sugar content based on dry weight, including myo-inositol, galactinol, 1-kestose, raffinose, glucose, fructose, maltose, and sucrose contents (mg/100 mg dry weight [DW]) of the durian pulp at three ripening stages (including unripe, midripe, and ripe).

Galactinol content decreased during ripening, which was in agreement with the two analytical methods (Figure 3) , whereas myo-inositol content remained unchanged, as confirmed by HPAEC-PAD. Raffinose and myo-inositol are synthesized from galactinol. The decrease in galactinol during the ripening period suggested that it might be stored before ripening then is converted to the downstream sugars later. The accumulation of raffinose-family sugars varies between various fruits (Jovanovic-Malinovska et al., 2014) , and their role in fruits has not been studied much to date; however, they may be involved in stress tolerance during ripening. Furthermore, we found an increase in sugar phosphates, including glucosamine-6-phosphate, N-acetyl-D-galactosamine-6-phosphate, lactose-1-phosphate, sucrose-6phosphate, and trehalose-6-phosphate in ripe durian pulp with log 2 FC ranging between 1.34 and 2.09 (Figure 2) . Sugar phosphates are intermediates in different biological pathways. In addition, they also act as signaling molecules. One interesting metabolite is trehalose-6-phosphate, which is an intermediate for trehalose biosynthesis. It is an important signaling molecule for sucrose consumption and a negative feedback molecule for sucrose biosynthesis in plants (Fichtner et al., 2020) . Therefore, the increase in trehalose-6-phosphate in durian pulp possibly helps to control the sucrose content and supports trehalose content at the same time.",

Another abundant organic acid was citrate, and its content was not significantly changed during the ripening period (Supplementary Table 2) . Therefore, malate and succinate probably contribute to sour taste in the ripe fruit, even if the sweet taste is dominant in the pulp, due to high sugar composition.

We detected 31 ripeningassociated amino acids, while three amino acids were unchanged: asparagine, glutamate, and threonine. Levels of 15 proteinogenic and 14 non-proteinogenic amino acids increased during durian ripening, with log 2 FC ranging between 1.34-5.65 and between 1.4-9.15, respectively, while only aspartate and ornithine decreased (Log 2 FC = \u22121.36 and \u22125.64, respectively) (Figure 2) . Durian pulp contains several volatile sulfur compounds. The volatiles are associated with amino acids in sulfur-related pathways. Notably, cysteine is the most modulated amino acid in the pathway (Figure 2 and Supplementary Table 4) and is an important precursor for the biosynthesis of methionine, another sulfur-containing amino acid. We found that methionine levels slightly increased in ripening durian pulp (Figure 2 and Supplementary Table 4 ). Methionine is a central metabolite of the sulfur pathway and ethylene biosynthesis, in which ethylene is an important compound for climacteric ripening. Therefore, this may be the reason for the slight changes in methionine content during ripening. Methionine is also an important precursor for sulfur volatile production, providing strong odor. Previous research on melon demonstrated that exogenous apply of methionine increased the content of sulfur volatiles related to methanethiol (Gonda et al., 2013) . Interestingly, methanethiol and other thiol volatiles can be detected at high concentrations in ripe durian pulp using static headspace gas chromatographyolfactometry (SHGC-O) (Li et al., 2012) and headspace solidphase microextraction GC-MS (Teh et al., 2017) . In addition, we also found the accumulation of serine and homoserine (Figure 2) , which are intermediates in the sulfur pathway, supporting the involvement of the pathway during the ripening process. Therefore, the accumulation of these amino acids may provide key precursors that contribute to the characteristic sulfuryl odor of durian.",

We found a significant increase in the levels of these three amino acids and the isoleucine-derived keto acid, 4-methyl-2-oxovalerate in ripe durian pulp (Figure 2) . According to a previous study conducted on strawberry, exogenously applied isoleucine increased the level of ethyl 2-methylbutanoate, a volatile ester (Perez et al., 2002) . Furthermore, either exogenously applied isoleucine or 4-methyl-2-oxovalerate elevated the levels of ethyl 2-methylbutanoate, while applying valine increased the ethyl 2-methylpropanoate level (Gonda et al., 2010) . These two volatiles, providing fruity odor, were also identified at high concentrations in the durian pulp (Li et al., 2012) .

Moreover, it is involved in the biosynthesis of lysine, methionine, isoleucine, leucine, and valine, whose contents increased during ripening, and threonine, whose content was unchanged. Therefore, the decrease in aspartate levels during ripening could result from its usage for biosynthesis of other amino acids. Glutamate is a highly abundant amino acid that provides the umami taste in durian pulp (Pinsorn et al., 2018) . We found that the glutamate content remained constant during the ripening period (Supplementary Table 2) . Glutamate can be converted to other metabolites, such as glutamine, arginine, proline, and GABA (Sorrequieta et al., 2010) . We observed increased levels of proline and hydroxyproline during ripening. Until now, the roles of these two metabolites in fruits have not been well understood. Previous studies have shown that accumulation of proline is involved in the nitrogen sink mechanism, and it helps to increase the fruit quality traits and yield (Sayed et al., 2014) . Regarding the precursors for polyamine biosynthesis, we found that the arginine content was unchanged (Supplementary Table 2) , while ornithine content decreased during the ripening period (Figure 2) .

Furthermore, previous studies have shown that they are also involved in the modulation of fruit ripening by intricate crosstalk with the ethylene pathway (Tassoni et al., 2006) . The role of polyamines in durian pulp still requires further investigation, and their accumulation might be related to the ripening period of durian. Polyamines are also precursors for biosynthesis of GABA, a health-promoting bioactive compound. Interestingly, GABA was highly enriched in ripe durian pulp (Supplementary Table 4 and Figure 2 ). Although the role of GABA accumulation in fruit has not been clearly ascertained, previous studies have shown that it is associated with abiotic stress responses in strawberry (Deewatthanawong et al., 2010) , tomato (Wu et al., 2020) , and apple (Brikis et al., 2018) . It has been shown that these fruits accumulate high GABA content under elevated CO 2 and low O 2 . Therefore, the role of GABA in durian might also be involved in stress response.

The clean reads were then used to perform de novo assembly, which generated 164,618 transcripts with an average length of 1,082.68 bp, and a total of 85,164 coding regions were predicted. Afterward, total reads of each library were mapped to the de novo assembled transcriptome (Supplementary Table 5 ). The annotation results of transcripts are shown in Supplementary Table 6 . The number of the transcripts obtained in this study is similar to the previous report by Teh et al. (2017) . The PCA plot shows that the expression of transcripts in the unripe samples were clearly separated from the ripe samples according to PC1 (90.1%) (Supplementary Figure 5) , suggesting that gene expression changes as the ripening progresses. DEG analysis identified a total of 18,616 DEGs (Supplementary Table 7 ) with 8,145 upregulated genes and 10,471 downregulated genes. Subsequently, we identified the top 10 upregulated genes by FC. Two of those genes were polygalacturonase (PG) and 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate synthase (ACS) (Supplementary Table 7) , which are responsible for cell wall degradation and ethylene biosynthesis, respectively. In addition, we identified a key sulfur metabolism gene, methionine gamma-lyase (MGL), which contributes to VSC biosynthesis in sulfur metabolism (Teh et al., 2017) . Although MGL did not have a high FC value, it showed a remarkably high RPKM expression value (Supplementary Table 8) , suggesting its importance during durian ripening. Additionally, a high RPKM value was also found for 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate oxidase (Supplementary Table 8) at the ripe stage. DEGs were then used to perform GO analysis, and most of the GO terms were assigned to biological processes. Within biological processes, the largest proportion was in protein modification by small protein conjugation and ubiquitin-dependent protein catabolic process categories, respectively. Within molecular function, the largest proportion was in the ATPase activity category. Lastly, within the cellular compartment, the largest proportion was in the host cell nucleus category (Supplementary Figure 6) . To reveal the biological pathways associated with DEG data, DEGs were assigned to KEGG. The results showed that the DEGs participated in 144 biological pathways. The top five pathways are purine metabolism, thiamine metabolism, starch and sucrose metabolism, glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, and pyruvate metabolism (Supplementary Figure 7) . This result is consistent with the metabolic pathway analysis which found that the change of nucleotide metabolism, sugar metabolism, and central carbon metabolism was highly associated with the durian ripening process.",

            "text": "The expression of these isoforms is consistent with the accumulation of pyruvate, the final product of the pathway (Figure 5) , suggesting that these candidate genes participate in glycolysis during durian ripening. Afterward, pyruvate is converted to acetyl-CoA and enters the TCA cycle by pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH), whose isoform was annotated as PDH acyl-transferring subunit was upregulated in the ripe durian pulp (Figure 5 and Supplementary Table 8 ). The first step of the TCA cycle is producing citrate, which is controlled by citrate synthase (CS). Although CS was upregulated, the content of citrate remained constant during ripening (Figure 5) , suggesting that the rate of citrate biosynthesis is probably equal to citrate consumption in the durian. Furthermore, we also observed the upregulation of other genes in the TCA cycle, including isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH), \u03b1-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase (2-OGDH), fumarase (FUM), and malate dehydrogenase (MDH), together with the upregulated metabolites, isocitrate, succinate, fumarate, and malate ( Figure 5) . These results show the activation of the TCA cycle, supporting citrate biosynthesis during ripening. Citrate is used in glutamate metabolism and is bypassed through \u03b1-ketoglutarate. We found that the content of \u03b1-ketoglutarate was unchanged during the ripening period. Notably, the gene for its biosynthesis, IDH, the gene for its degradation, 2-OGDH, and glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH), were upregulated ( Figure 5) . This result suggests that \u03b1-ketoglutarate content remains constant because it is converted for the TCA cycle by 2-OGDH and bypassed to glutamate metabolism by GDH. Similar observations were found in other fruits, such as tomato (Yin et al., 2010) , showing that the change in citrate is correlated to \u03b1-ketoglutarate content during ripening and salt-stress treatment. Although some metabolites in this pathway do not provide the dominant taste found in ripe durian, they serve as important precursors for the biosynthesis of other taste-related compounds, which will be discussed later.",

Additionally, there are three routes for glutamate biosynthesis, including aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and glutamate synthase (GOGAT).

Notably, the route from AST (LOC111284590) contained the highest log 2 FC (4.83) and RPKM expression value compared to the other routes (Supplementary Table 8 ). Therefore, this route is highly activated for glutamate biosynthesis during durian ripening. Glutamate interconverts with aspartate, and this step is controlled by AST.

Furthermore, we also found the upregulation of nitrate reductase (NR) (Supplementary Table 8 ). It has been reported that GS and NR were upregulated under higher nitrogen supply, resulting in higher accumulation of soluble sugars, free amino acids, and other substances related to fruit quality (Scarpeci et al., 2007; Liao et al., 2019) .

Only one isoform of the gene was found in our transcriptomic data, and it was downregulated during durian ripening, which was not consistent with the increased proline content (Figure 5) . A previous report showed that proline content may not be correlated to the expression of P5CR in developing tissues of Arabidopsis (Hua et al., 1997) .

These two amino acids can later be converted to putrescine, a precursor for further polyamine production. We propose that the primary route for polyamine biosynthesis in durian pulp is through arginine route because the key gene arginine decarboxylase (ADC) was upregulated with high RPKM value during durian ripening (Figure 5 and Supplementary Table 8) , while the expression level of ornithine decarboxylase (ODC), controlling the reaction from ornithine to putrescine, was not significantly changed. The arginine route has been found to be a major pathway for polyamine biosynthesis in other fruits such as apple and tomato (Hao et al., 2005) . For the polyamine pathway, spermidine synthase (SPDS) and spermine synthase (SPMS) control steps that convert putrescine to spermidine and spermine, respectively. We found upregulation of SPDS and SPMS during durian ripening (Figure 5) , which were not correlated with spermidine and spermine content. Spermidine is either converted to 4aminobutyraldehyde or is used for spermine biosynthesis. Moreover, spermine can be degraded by \u03b2-alanine metabolism. Therefore, these are probably the reasons for the unchanged spermidine content and decreased spermine content during the ripening period.",

Interestingly, we found a significant increase in GABA levels in the ripe durian pulp (Figure 2) . There are two main GABA biosynthetic pathways in fruits, which are GABA shunts and alternative pathways from polyamines. For the GABA shunt, we found the upregulation of glutamate decarboxylase (GAD) in ripening durian pulp, which is positively correlated with GABA content (Figure 5) . GABA shunts are the major pathway in many fruits. GAD is the key gene that controls the conversion from glutamate to GABA in this pathway. Similar to results from citrus fruit, the activation of GABA shunt is also related to increased transcription of GDH, AST, and GS, which is a major route for citrate catabolism (Katz et al., 2011; Sadka et al., 2019) . These findings are consistent with our results in ripening durian. In addition, we found the upregulation of several genes in polyamine-derived-GABA biosynthesis, including polyamine oxidase (PAO) and 4-aminobutanal dehydrogenase (ALDH10). Therefore, our gene expression results supported the theory that two pathways contribute to GABA production during durian ripening.",

Besides the sulfuryl aroma, ripe durian also contains a sweet, fruity aroma, and the volatiles providing such aroma are associated with branched-chain amino acid metabolism. Interestingly, we observed high upregulation of threonine ammonia-lyase (TAL) (Log 2 FC = 5.52) (Supplementary Table 8 ), which converts threonine to 2-oxobutanoate, an important intermediate for BCAA biosynthesis, during durian ripening (Figure 5) . Moreover, we also observed high upregulation of genes in the BCAA pathway, such as branched-chain amino acid aminotransferase (BCAT) (Log 2 FC = 6.32) (Supplementary Table 8) , which is a key regulatory gene controlling branched-chain amino acid biosynthesis and degradation (Gonda et al., 2010; Maloney et al., 2010) , supporting the activation of this pathway. In addition, branched-chain amino acids are precursors for volatile ester production. Notably, the upregulation of 3-methyl-2-oxobutanoate dehydrogenase (BCKDHA) and long-chain-enoyl-CoA hydratase (EHHADH), which are key genes in pathways connected to branched-chain amino acid degradation (Kochevenko et al., 2012) , was observed during durian ripening (Figure 5 and Supplementary Table 8) .",
