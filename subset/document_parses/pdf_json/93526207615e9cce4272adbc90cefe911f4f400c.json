Data augmentation based methods construct pseudohealthy images by \"pasting\" fake lesions on real healthy ones, and a network is trained to predict healthy images in a supervised manner. The lesion can be found by difference between the unhealthy input and pseudo-healthy output. However, using only manually designed fake lesions fail to approximate to irregular real lesions, hence limiting the model generalization. We assume by exploring the intrinsic data property within images, we can distinguish previously unseen lesions from healthy regions in an unhealthy image. In this study, we propose an Adaptive Fourier Space Compression (AFSC) module to distill healthy feature for AD. The compression of both magnitude and phase in frequency domain addresses the hyper intensity and diverse position of lesions. Experimental results on the BraTS and MS-SEG datasets demonstrate an AFSC baseline is able to produce promising detection results, and an AFSC module can be effectively embedded into existing AD methods.",

Deep Learning (DL) has been developed into a powerful tool with a wide gamut of applications, spanning a wide range of medical image analysis applications including detection of lesions. DL based supervised lesion detection methods are virtually ineffective in the face of emergent diseases (e.g. covid-19) that have not been seen in the training phase. In addition, these methods need to meet pathology-sufficiency conditions (with a large number of pathological images in the training phase) and require image-level or pixel-level labels, which are timeconsuming and laborious to obtain. Consequently, Anomaly Detection (AD) has logically become a very promising clinical diagnostic aid as a way of dealing with pathology-deficiency situations (lack of pathological images during the training phase) [6] .",

This type of method exploits the network to generate a pseudo-healthy image paired with an anomalous image and locates the anomalous region by the difference between the pair [7] . AnoGAN by Schlegl et al [11] , a network for finding pseudo-healthy images paired with input images from latent space was proposed, by learning a mapping from image space to latent space. However, the inference process of AnoGAN is very time consuming as it needs to iteratively search for the closest pseudo-healthy image in latent space for the input image. Recently, in order to avoid the tedious search process like AnoGAN in the inference phase, several approaches have been dedicated to finding artificially generated anomaly image methods with generalizability. The aim is for models to have the ability to recover artificial anomalous images to normal images and generalize to real anomalous images during the testing phase. For example, Vitjan et al. [14] have proposed a method to generate anomalous images by overlaying randomly sampled texture images, which were obtained from a combination of multiple enhancement functions, onto normal images.",

Therefore, to capture the most essential information used to generate pseudo-healthy images and make the model more generalizable, we are working to find a subtraction method. In this way, RIAD [15] attempts to randomly mask the image to lose lesion information and subsequently repair the lost anomalous regions to healthy areas by inpainting. However, there are limitations to RIAD due to the stochastic character of the masked area and the nonxed nature of the lesion regions. Therefore, we step outside the image space and turn our view into Fourier space. Each value of the phase and amplitude spectra in Fourier space contains information about the spatial and intensity of the whole image, respectively [8] , so we assume that compressing both to capture the most essential health information for generating pseudo-health images will greatly reduce the interference of the lesions during testing. A dilemma is how to effectively compress the Fourier space for AD tasks? To this end, we propose an Adaptive Fourier Space Compression (AFSC) for Anomaly Detection inspired by Monte Carlo strategies in [9] .",

Following [14] , the standard metric of anomaly detection, AUROC, is used in the evaluation of our method. Image-level AUROC is applied to overall slice anomaly detection, and pixel-level AUROC is used for per-slice anomaly localization evaluation. We further report the average precision(AP) measure on the image-level and pixel-level for the false positive rate of the test results. Table 1 . Evaluation results on the BraTS2017 dataset. The best mean of each metric is shown in underline. We compared AFSC with other state-of-the-art anomaly detection methods AnoGAN [11] , DRAEM [14] and AE [4] . As DRAEM generates anomaly scores differently from other methods, we additionally obtain anomaly score maps for the pseudo-health images it generates by the same difference calculation as other methods, denoted as DRAEM_G, for a fair comparison. The joint of AFSCm with AE and DRAEM respectively was used for the comparison of the vanilla methods in order to test the flexibility of AFSCm (AnoGAN cannot be joined with AFSCm, as its input is a random variable rather than an image). We empirically set the sparsity of the corresponding compression modules to 0.9, 0.5 and 0.5 for AE w/AFSCm , DRAEM w/AFSCm and AFSC respectively (in the experiments of this paper the sparsity settings are the same for phase and amplitude, although different sparsities can be set). Table 1 summarises the results of all methods at BraTS2017. Overall, AFSC achieved optimal results for almost all metrics, compared with other methods. Importantly, all metrics of AE w/AFSCm ,DRAEM_G w/AFSCm have been improved after the joint AFSCm. In particular, DRAEM_G w/AFSCm achieved the best for all methods on the Brats dataset in both dice and APpix metrics. As shown in the visualisation of the results in Figure 2 , AFSCm enabled all generated pseudo-healthy images to be more anatomically accurate and made most lesions resemble healthy tissue. Furthermore, we observe that AE w/AFSCm performs better than AE, although the input of AE are healthy images. That AF-SCm is valid for anomaly detection methods based on pseudo-health generation in which the input are healthy images can still be verified by this phenomenon. Due to the cross-dataset testing, AnoGAN did not use the test samples as input to the generator and only searched for representations of healthy samples in the latent space which were similar to the test images, hence the poor overall test performance.",
