As of July 2020, older adults (>60 yrs) represented 33% of the total cases, 70.2% of those hospitalized, and 96.7% of deaths due to COVID-19 in Canada where this study took place [2] . Initially, a high proportion of severe COVID-19 cases among older adults were linked to Long Term Care outbreaks in Canada [3] . Consequently, early in the pandemic governments identified older adults as a vulnerable group, instructing them to self-isolate, and encouraging greater caution and physical distancing from older adults as well as people with compromised immune systems [4] . The protective response toward older adults during COVID-19 raises questions about potential unintended consequences of physical distancing and isolation over time.",

Loneliness refers to the gap between the quantity, quality, and mode of relationships one has and those they desire to meet their needs [12] . In analyzing these two concepts together, Newall and Menec [11] described four groups: the majority group (those not lonely nor isolated), the lonely in a crowd (lonely but not isolated), the life-long isolates, loners, or 'lone farmers,' (isolated but not lonely) and the vulnerable (both isolated and lonely). They argued that the latter three groups should not be assumed to be homogenous when considering their needs or designing interventions to support them. Indeed, older adults' experiences, needs, and social contexts are diverse and dynamic.",

For example, very old age, being single or living alone, and lower income can increase the likelihood of experiencing social isolation and loneliness [15, 16] .

Quantitative studies comparing loneliness in urban versus rural settings reveal distinct factors influencing loneliness and isolation in rural areas as compared to urban areas [19] . Rural environments are characterized by greater physical isolation due to lower population densities, long distances to other centres, and lack of transportation and infrastructure that can contribute to isolation [20] . However, people living in rural communities tend to report a greater sense of community belonging than those in urban areas [21] . They may also develop and rely on a network of family, friends, and neighbours for support to a greater extent than their urban counterparts [22] , but some research suggests that economic and social restructuring in rural places may leave older adults with much smaller support networks nearby [23, 24] . Such local social and environmental conditions are perhaps more critical to understanding social isolation and loneliness, particularly during COVID times because of the restricted geographies that older adults and their social relations, younger or older, are living in today.",

Given that older adults have been identified as an at-risk group in the face of this pandemic, this may pose even more complexity in terms of how older adults maintain relationships during this time and balance their need to feel safe with their need to interact with others. We know little about older adults' everyday experiences and place-based factors influencing levels of isolation and loneliness over the course of the pandemic.

All \"non-essential\" workers were encouraged to stay home, social gatherings outside the household were restricted, and the public were encouraged to keep six feet away from others in interactions with people outside their household. The federal government imposed the Quarantine Act, requiring those entering Canada to self-quarantine for 14 days. In addition, the Province of Manitoba initially required all out-of-province travelers to quarantine for 14 days. Initially, Manitoba contained the spread of COVID-19 in the spring and early summer of 2020, and most of the early cases were in the only census metropolitan area of the province, the city of Winnipeg. On 4 May 2020, the Province began their plan to \"restore safe services.\" All social gatherings (e.g., church, weddings, and funerals) were restricted to a maximum of 10 people and all food services remained closed, except for delivery, take-out and patio or walk-up food service. On 22 May 2020, public gatherings of 25 people were allowed indoors and 50 people outdoors and on 29 May 2020 outdoor visits to long-term care were allowed. Over the course of the summer the Province continued to reduce restrictions. However, by the end of July cases began to increase, including rural and small-town Manitoba. Our study focuses on participants' experiences of initial restrictions and reopening and does not reflect older adults' experiences as cases increased after July 2020.",

How many? How far away? How often do you normally see them? How many friends do you have in your community? How do you keep in touch with friends and family during this pandemic? What sorts of activities are you doing during this pandemic?). Participants were also asked to rate how often they felt lonely during a given week both prior to COVID-19 pandemic as well as currently (i.e., during COVID-19 pandemic) using a 4-point scale ranging from 1 (never, rarely, less than 1 day), 2 (sometimes, 1-2 days), 3 (occasionally, 3-4 days), and 4 (all the time, 5-7 days), a commonly used loneliness item taken from the CES-D scale [29] . Asking people to rate their loneliness in this way allowed us to examine whether people reported perceived changes (increases, decreases, no change) in their levels of loneliness pre-and during-COVID-19. At the end of the interview, participants were asked another series of open-ended questions about challenges, needs, and resources and strategies within their environments.

We then used qualitative thematic analysis to examine what influenced participants' isolation and sense of loneliness, as well as what conditions mitigated isolation and loneliness. Interview transcripts were coded and organized using Nvivo 12 software (QSR International, Melbourne, Australia). Three researchers coded the first transcript inductively with a focus on participant experiences. The primary researcher continued to code transcripts independently. On a weekly basis during data collection, the three researchers met to code a new transcript, review the code book, discuss divergent interpretations of the data, and come to a consensus on inductive codes. This process of regular initial coding meetings enhanced the credibility and confirmability of analysis by ensuring that interpretations were reviewed and confirmed by multiple researchers who were directly involved in the interviews. After a round of initial coding, the researchers grouped inductive themes under larger overarching categories in line with the research questions. Loss of autonomy and the loss of activities and social spaces were identified as dominant and distinctive challenges during COVID-19, while lack of meaningful connection at home was a significant factor influencing loneliness for the loneliest participants. Past experiences of isolation in rural places, negotiating physically distanced visits, connecting with others, and \"keeping busy\" were identified as resources and strategies to mitigate isolation and loneliness. Figure 1 shows the reported levels of isolation before COVID (retrospective), during the first interview, and during the second interview. Of the 17 people who reported NOT feeling isolated prior to COVID-19, all but four people reported being isolated during COVID-19 restrictions (May-June).

Although a small number of participants suggested a preference for isolation, other participants pointed to a lack of programs, services, and social connections in their rural environment as factors contributing to their isolation prior to COVID-19. This is consistent with the broader research literature on age-related social exclusion of older rural adults [31] , and more generally, on rural-urban differences in older Canadian adults' health and well-being [32] . Although older adults in rural areas may have been accustomed to a greater degree of social isolation, not surprisingly, most participants in the study reported feeling more isolated because of the profound physical distancing required with the COVID-19 restrictions. One of the unique contributions of this study, is that some older adults identified past experiences of isolation in rural places as a resource for coping with isolation during COVID-19.

Participants who felt the loneliest revealed the importance of resources and strategies for mitigating loneliness in their homes and surrounding communities, including the need for meaningful conversations during times of isolation. This was particularly the case for an isolated dementia carer, in the study, calling attention to the importance of remotely delivered social programs. Indeed, participants' narratives suggest that both before, and during COVID-19, it was important to have a range of choices, activities, and places to go; this is not surprising, but the challenge ahead lies in how local communities and organizations support initiatives that meet the social needs of older adults safely.",

For example, they can promote the development of modified, flexible or new activities such as online or physically distanced programs and services. The older adults in the study identified limitations of online and remote initiatives, but they also identified low tech strategies for mitigating isolation and loneliness such as telephone check-ins, using telephone support services, physically distanced outdoor visits, and keeping busy (e.g., walking and gardening). Some of these strategies can be supported at the community level through campaigns to end loneliness, continuing safe volunteer opportunities for older adults, as well as access to safe walking paths and other outdoor community spaces.",

            "text": "The early results of this study paint a somewhat hopeful picture-many older adults adapted and, among those who experienced increased isolation and loneliness, many returned to pre-COVID levels of isolation and loneliness-but the pandemic continues. We do not know how older adults' experiences have changed even six months later. Continued longitudinal work on the impacts of the pandemic is critical to understanding the longterm impacts on social isolation and loneliness. We acknowledge that the three-month window in which data collection took place for this study was a small window of time, yet it was also a time of tremendous change and uncertainty in the lives of older adults. Capturing older adults' perceptions of this change, through a rating scale and subsequent explanation, as well as their strategies for responding to significant change is important to inform public health policy and practice. Public health policy and practice that is out of touch with, or insensitive to, perceptions and experiences is likely to be ineffective or may even be harmful. Another limitation of our research is that most participants lived with someone and more women than men participated in interviews. In addition, few participants self-identified as racialized or Indigenous. Future research should explore the specific experiences of those who live alone as well as the gendered, classed, and racialized experienced of social isolation and loneliness during this time. Despite these limitations, the strength of this study involved its emphasis on capturing rich descriptions of this very particular time and place, characterized by unprecedented isolation. Future qualitative research should continue to explore older adults' experiences and responses to change during the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond, with particular attention to their environments and resources.",

            "text": "Rural community-dwelling older adults are a diverse group with different resources and strategies influencing their pandemic experiences of social isolation and loneliness; however, they share experiences of living in isolated places prior to COVID-19. Consequently, many had developed strategies to manage isolation and protect themselves from loneliness prior to the pandemic, some had resigned to a degree of isolation attributing it to their rural context, and a smaller number identified as isolates by preference, perhaps fitting into the 'lifelong isolates' grouping discussed by Newall and Menec [11] . This is not to suggest they were unaffected or that they did not need resources to mitigate isolation and loneliness. On the contrary, the pandemic and associated restrictions have reinforced the importance of autonomy and choice, as well as access to everyday social spaces and activities within ones' immediate environment. Even as restrictions eased, not all participants regained autonomy and choice and many of the routines associated with social spaces changed. In addition, participants experienced new challenges as they negotiated physically distanced visits. Using communications technology, checking in with others, and engaging in a range of activities to keep busy were helpful for older adults in this study. However, these strategies were not without limitations and they were not universally accessible. Moreover, the pandemic highlights the continued importance of place-based resources for protecting against isolation and loneliness. As the pandemic continues it is essential that older adults continue to have choices, places to go, people to engage with, and a range of activities within their homes and their surrounding communities.",
