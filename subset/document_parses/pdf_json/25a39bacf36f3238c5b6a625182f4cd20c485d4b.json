In brief, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were isolated from peripheral blood by Ficoll-Hypaque density gradient centrifugation. Isolated PBMC were stimulated with 15mer overlapping peptides pools (OPP) with an 11 amino acids overlaps from SARS-CoV-2 wild type S-protein (JPT, Germany). For the analysis of Delta-VOCreactive T cell response, a pool of 32 15-mer peptides (Miltenyi Biotec, Germany) covering all 10 mutations of the Delta-VOC or the corresponding positions in the Wuhan variant (Miltenyi Biotec) were used. All OPP were dissolved according to the manufacturer's instructions and used at a final concentration of 1 \u03bcg/ml. Untreated PBMC were used as negative control to assess unspecific background activation. As a positive control, PBMC were stimulated with SEB (1 \u03bcg/ml, Sigma Aldrich). After 2h of stimulation, Brefeldin-A (Sigma-Aldrich) was added and cells were harvested after 16h. Surface-and intracellular-staining for flow cytometry was performed using fixation and permeabilization (ThermoFisher) and antibodies for markers listed below according to manufactures instruction. Samples were measured on a CytoFlex flow cytometer (Beckman-Coulter). Flow cytometry data were analyzed with FlowJo version 10.8.1 (BD Biosciences). Single stains and fluorescence-minus-one controls were used for gating. CD4 + T cells expressing CD154 and CD169 and CD8 + T cells expressing CD137and CD69 were defined as SARS-COV-2 reactive T cells. Unspecific activation in unstimulated controls was subtracted from stimulated samples to account for SARS-CoV-2-specific activation in the presented frequencies. Responses were considered if they are identifiable as a visible cell cluster exceeding 10 T cells and 0.01% of CD4 or CD8 T-cells, respectively. ",
