Modern antibody panels can detect multiple antigens and/or antibodies or the presence of IgM or IgA antibodies within hours of specimen submission.

For example, early detection of HIV-1 infection and strain resistance to selected antiretroviral drugs has enabled physicians around the world to more accurately diagnose and treat HIV-1 infection with the appropriate antiretrovirals. Newer automated tests using nanotechnology that no longer require addition of multiple reagents are being used for point-of-care diagnosis.

The diagnosis of enteroviral meningitis, herpes simplex virus (HSV) encephalitis, and CMV infections in immunocompromised patients are examples of clinically relevant and cost-effective applications of nucleic acid-based tests. Conventional methods are more readily replaced in virology than in bacteriology because the tissue culture-based virology methods are costly and generally less sensitive than newer molecular methods. Some viruses are highly labile (eg, respiratory syncytial virus [RSV]), cannot be routinely cultured (eg, coronaviruses), or are dangerous to culture (eg, variola). Antiviral susceptibility testing is not routinely performed, but when it is needed, such as for the identification of ganciclovir-resistant CMV, mutations can be rapidly identified using nucleic acid amplification coupled with sequencing. In addition, FDA-cleared multiplex assays utilizing real-time amplification methods enable the simultaneous detection of multiple respiratory viruses, and research assays can detect the nucleic acid of viruses heretofore unrecognized and/ or not cultivatable in vitro. Beyond pathogen identification, molecular methods guide patient management. Quantification of viral nucleic acid is used to stage disease activity, prognosticate disease progression, and monitor efficacy of therapy. For example, the risk of progression to AIDS and ultimately death is directly related to the magnitude of the HIV-1 RNA level in plasma. Similarly, viral load determines the risk of perinatal and sexual transmission. Reduction in viral load levels is associated with increased patient survival and decreased viral transmission. Genotyping of selected pathogens is important for specific therapeutic protocols, especially for HCV and HIV-1. Antiviral susceptibility testing also guides specific therapy.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Diagnosis and Patient Management"}, {"text": "Genotyping by molecular methods also has prognostic value.

Testing for high-risk HPV DNA is an established method for managing women with the cervical cytologic diagnosis of atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance. Patients are referred for colposcopy based on the detection of high-risk types of HPV DNA. Similarly, CMV load testing can help distinguish between active disease and asymptomatic infection, as higher levels of CMV DNA increase the risk of active disease. Thus, CMV load measurement is useful for deciding when to initiate preemptive therapy in organ transplant recipients.

Results depend on the analyte, sensitivity of the test, type of sample collected, age of the patient, and time of testing after onset of clinical symptoms.

These assays can be performed on-demand, require minimal hands-on time (1-2 minutes), require minimal technical skills to operate, and provide rapid results (20 minutes to 5 hours). However, a limitation of some cartridge-based platforms is throughput capability. Some systems only allow 1 test to be performed at a time, often requiring multiple expensive separate platforms or additional modules. Until there is an FDA CLIA-waived molecular POC bedside test, self-contained multiplex amplification platforms can be located in central/ referral clinical laboratories, rapid response laboratories, and CLIA-certified mini-laboratories in clinic and public health facilities, while still providing a result within the needed time frame.

Today, molecular diagnostic testing has moved toward a more broad syndromic screening approach. This trend is the result of sophisticated technologies that enable the detection of >1 analyte at a time. Tests/devices vary from low multiplex (2-5 analytes) to 25 or more different analytes, often now combining a mixture of pathogen types, (eg, bacteria, viruses, and parasites), and also antibiotic resistance markers. New highly multiplexed cartridge-based systems can detect the majority of bacterial pathogens that cause community, ventilator-associated, and hospital-acquired pneumonia within 1-2 hours. In addition, these systems can detect >20 antibiotic resistance genetic markers. The intent is not to replace culture, as additional characterization of isolates still needs to be performed on cultured samples, but to provide a POC early diagnosis that can lead to more focused appropriate antimicrobial therapy. Other multiplex panels focus on pathogens found in patients with a clinical picture of septic shock or diarrhea caused by a gastrointestinal pathogen. Multiplexed enteric disease panels target common bacterial pathogens such as Salmonella, Shigella, Yersinia, Vibrio, and Campylobacter species, and in addition, bacterial toxins (eg, Shiga toxin), parasites (eg, Giardia), and viruses (eg, norovirus). The selection of assay analytes must be clinically relevant; more analytes is not always better and the testing expense may not be reimbursed. At least in the near term, multiplex amplification platforms will replace some activities (viral culture) but will supplement other testing (antibiotic in vitro susceptibility testing). Molecular platforms need to adapt quickly to changing clinical environments. New pathogens are identified (eg, MERS-CoV), variants of old pathogens emerge (eg, influenza A[H1N1]pdm09 and H7N9), and new antibiotic resistance mechanisms evolve (eg, K. pneumoniae carbapenemases and New Delhi metallo-\u03b2-lactamase-1). Hence, there is a strong indication for flexibility in test or instrument design. For example, multiplex systems involve complex primer and probe interactions during the initial or subsequent amplification and detection steps. The addition of new primers and probes to detect an additional target will require validation of the newly added target and demonstration that the performance for existing targets is not affected. The revalidation of all existing targets does not need to be undertaken again, and the experimental evidence required demonstrating performance is limited to key points that can be addressed through in-house studies. Furthermore, FDA encourages assay developers to archive specimens used during the clinical evaluation for future use, especially in cases where the multiplex panel is being expanded. These ideas can and have been applied to existing cleared multiplex devices to address detection of emerging and evolving pathogens; however, it is important to note that these mechanisms should not be used to inflate the assay menu of a device to increase marketability, but rather should be used to address true public health needs.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Shift From Single-Analyte Testing to Multiplex Testing"}, {"text": "To test for the presence of nucleic acid targets in clinical samples, it is necessary to extract the nucleic acids from the pathogen, amplify the genetic target, and then detect the amplified sequences.

Nucleic acid amplification technologies have evolved from traditional and real-time PCR, to newer methods such as loop-mediated amplification (LAMP), transcription-mediated amplification, nucleic acid sequence-based amplification (NASBA), and strand displacement amplification (SDA).

Amplified nucleic acid fragments enter the ionization chamber of an ESI-TOF mass spectrometer. Charged strands leave the electrospray phase and are pulsed under high vacuum. The nucleic acid strands move through the flight tube; lower mass amplicons travel faster and reach the detector before higher mass amplicons. Each time an amplicon is detected, the mass spectrum increases. In general, the ESI-TOF interrogates the amplicon weight to determine the base compositions of complementary DNA strands from multiple sequences. A small number of possible base compositions are consistent with each measured mass. Base compositions of forward and reverse amplicon strands must be complementary, reducing possibilities to a single, unique base composition, allowing for accurate identification of the target. This technology has been used to identify viral respiratory and biothreat pathogens, including novel variants of influenza. Resistance genes and specific toxins have also been detected. A major benefit is the ability to identify many diverse pathogens without having to target each analyte specifically. As with all mass spectrometry systems, the scope of pathogen detection is dependent on the accuracy of the ESI-TOF database. Although this technology has great promise, there are several drawbacks with the current instruments. The process is slow, labor intensive, and, for direct sample testing, would require nucleic acid isolation and amplification to produce sufficient concentrations of nucleic acids for detection.

Sequencing can provide a genus identification for generally >90% of the strains, and species-level identification in 65%-85% of the isolates tested. Some isolates are either misidentified due to high sequence similarities to other pathogens (eg, N. gonorrhoeae and Neisseria meningitidis using 16S RNA sequences) or are never identified.

To meet the needs for routine clinical testing, compact NGS systems have been developed with a small footprint and fast turnaround time. Using these systems, sequencing could replace complex multifaceted traditional microbiological identification procedures such as biochemical testing, and sequencing could detect virulence determinants and the genetic markers of antimicrobial resistance. Sequencing, however, may miss new and uncharacterized genetic elements responsible for phenotypic resistance mechanisms. This will require companies to perform extensive phenotypic/genotypic comparisons and may in addition require gene expression analysis for detecting complex phenotypes (eg, changes in porin expression related to carbapenem resistance). Sequence data has already proved its value in tracking outbreaks of infection due to resistant bacteria (eg, the NIH outbreak of multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacteria [55] and the cholera outbreak in Haiti [50] ). Future studies need to address the clinical relevance of finding a fragment of nucleic acid that may not correlate with the patient's clinical syndrome. Finally, NGS systems need easy, concise, low-cost data management and interpretation software and access to well-vetted databases.

MALDI-TOF MS testing is relatively simple and, for most bacteria, only requires transferring a portion of an isolated colony onto a well in a designated disposable or reusable target slide. Organisms such as mycobacteria and fungi usually require an additional pretreatment step to ensure nonviability of the organism before manipulation and extraction of the proteins of interest.

In the ionization chamber, positively charged molecules are accelerated through an electric field and then enter the time-of-flight mass analyzer. Smaller particles travel faster through the tube to the particle detector. The particle detector measures the flight times, which are converted into mass/velocity values and plotted on a mass spectrogram. The spectrogram is then compared to a validated library of spectrograms using proprietary algorithms specific to each manufacturer.

The initial cost for the MALDI-TOF MS unit ranges from approximately $160 000 to $250 000, and the yearly maintenance costs roughly $35 000 a year. However, these expenses are offset by the low reagent cost per identification ($.10-$.50) as compared to traditional microbiologic systems (approximately $2.50-$5.00 per identification) plus savings in technical time (about 1 minute per identification) and the clinical benefit of providing an organism identification in about 20 minutes [57] . Currently, when a blood culture is flagged as positive for organism growth, laboratories generally report the results of a Gram stain and need an additional 24-48 hours or more for organism identification and susceptibility test results. Alternative technologies such as peptide nucleic acid fluorescence in situ hybridization and NAAT systems can provide identification of an organism and some susceptibility data within hours. However, these tests are currently limited by the number of pathogens detected, cost per test (on average $25-$75) and, for some methods, technical time required to perform the testing. With MALDI-TOF MS, direct identification of virtually any organism from a positive blood culture broth is possible within 20 minutes at a cost of a few cents. Rapid pathogen identification has a major impact on the selection of antimicrobial therapy [61] . Preliminary studies demonstrate that MALDI-TOF MS can also detect certain types of antibiotic resistance mechanisms that result in structural modifications to the antibiotic [62] .

It has been known since the landmark study by Lakeman et al in 1995 [14] that PCR testing of CSF is a very sensitive and specific diagnostic tool for HSV encephalitis, essentially eliminating the need for brain biopsy. Yet, nearly 20 years later, there is not an FDA-cleared test for this indication, even though molecular testing is considered the standard of care for the diagnosis of HSV encephalitis. In the absence of an FDA-cleared test, clinicians rely on LDTs. One of the challenges of the approval process is that HSV encephalitis is a rare disease, with any given large medical center treating a few cases annually. The development of a specimen repository could be very useful for companies interested in developing such a test. In fact, there are several molecular tests for detecting genital tract HSV that have been FDA cleared.
