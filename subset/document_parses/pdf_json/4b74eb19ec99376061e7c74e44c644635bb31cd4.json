There is an extensive effort to control infection and disease caused by SARS-CoV-2. This study addressed the hypothesis that angiotensin II type I receptor blocker, Losartan, may restrict pathogenesis caused by SARS-CoV-2 by decreasing viral-induced cytopathological changes by blocking angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R), thus reducing the affinity of the virus for ACE2, and inhibiting papainlike protease of the virus. Method: Losartan inhibitory effect on deubiquitination and deISGylation properties of papain-like protease was investigated using a fluorescence method and gel shift analysis determining its inhibitory effects. The inhibitory effect of Losartan on SARS-CoV-2 cell replication was investigated both when losartan was added to the cell culture 1 hour before (pre-infection group) and 1 hour after (post-infection group) SARS-CoV-2 infection of Vero E6 cells. Results: Losartan treatment of Vero E6 cells prior to and after SARS-CoV-2 infection reduced SARS-CoV-2 replication by 80% and 70% respectively. Losartan was not a strong deubiquitinase and deISGylase inhibitor of PLpro. Conclusion: Losartan added pre-and post-infection to the Vero E6 cell culture significantly prevents cell destruction and replication by SARS-CoV2. Losartan has low side-effects, is readily available, and can be produced at high levels globally, all features of a promising drug in treatment of COVID-19 if validated by clinical trials.",

            "text": "Entry of the virus into the host cell initiates its replirrecation. Translation of two open reading frames, (ORF1a/ORF1b) produces two replicase polyproteins (pp1a/pp1ab) [7, 8] . These polyproteins each contain non-structural proteins (nsps) involved in viral replication. Cleavage of these replicases releases 16 nsps through an autoproteolyzing process. Sharing the first 11 nsps, pp1a and pp1ab release nsp1-11 and nsp1-16, respectively [9, 10] . Two cysteine proteases, papain-like protease (PLpro) and 3Chemotrypsin-like proteinase (3CLpro or Mpro), contribute to this proteolysis. PLpro is located in the sequence of nsp3 which separates nsp1/nsp2, nsp2/nsp3 and nsp3/nsp4 while Mpro, embedded in nsp5, separates the nsp4-11 of pp1a and nsp4-16 of pp1ab [10, 11] . Mpro has been shown to reduce induction of type I interferon [12] . In addition, PLpro of SARS-CoV-2, with 83% homology with its counterpart in SARS-CoV, has deubiquinating and deISGylating potential with differing substrates. PLpro of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 show predominance in cleaving ubiquitin-like interferon-stimulated gene 15 (ISG15) proteins over poly-ubiquitin chains. However, SARS-CoV cleaves ubiquitin more readily than SARS-CoV-2 [13, 14] . These properties modify and suppress the repertoire of host cell proteins and mediators such as IFN-\u03b2, ISG15 protein, IRF3, TLR3, TLR4, TLR7 and STING-mediated pathway engaged in innate immunity [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] . It is implied that both PLpro and Mpro influence the immunogenic molecular pathways which allows SARS-CoV-2 to evade recognition by innate immunity system which prolongs its incubation period in host cells.",

Stopping the use of ARBs was recommended in the early phase of the pandemic due to the concern over possible increase in viral load [28, 29] . Recent studies have revealed safety of ARBs in patients with COVID-19 [30, 31] . Importantly, a recent study proposed that Losartan, an ARB, could ameliorate complications, especially of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) associated with COVID-19 [27] . In a previous study, molecular dynamic (MD) analysis showed that Losartan could change the three-dimensional structure of ACE2, preventing establishment of strong bonds between RBD residues of the virus and the residues in ACE2 [27] , and subsequently decrease the affinity of the virus to its receptor. Furthermore, the MD analysis showed that Losartan could change the conformational shape of PLpro by occupying the place for inhibitors of PLpro with high docking energy (Fig.6 ) [27] . This implies that Losartan may act as a PLpro inhibitor.",

In addition, as ubiquitins are involved in normal regulatory cellular pathways, deubiquitinating activity of PLpro modifies the host cell environment promoting viral replication [38] . Further work on discoveries of noncovalent inhibitors of PLpro in 2008, which showed them to inhibit viral replication, was aborted soon [14, 39] .

In 2008, discovery of successful antivirals against SARS-CoV was paused after spread of the virus was contained. Discoveries in disease pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 can aid in discovery of novel treatments and drugs. One hypothesis proposes that dysregulation in renin-angiotensin system (RAS) components contribute to the cytokine storm in COVID-19. Downregulation of ACE2 during the entry of the virus into the host cells leads to an increase in angiotensin II/angiotensin(1-7) ratio with proinflammatory, pro-apoptotic, destructive and pro-thrombotic effects [27, 46] . In animal studies, it was shown that ACE2 deficiency in mice and infusion of Ang II in swine resulted in corneal inflammatory response and lung pathology, respectively, resembling exactly the immunopathological changes seen in COVID-19 [47, 48] .

It did not substantially suppress deISGylating ability of PLpro (Fig. 2) . It is possible that Losartan interacts with the P3/P4 pocket of PLpro adjacent to its active site and is displaced in the presence of ISG15. This pocket could facilitate cleavage of Ubl substrates by binding the C-terminal of leucine and arginine, of the RLRGG motif, through a protonating reaction in a cleft in the PLpro containing a conserved triad of Histidine(H272)-Cystein(C111)-Aspartic Acid(D286) in papain-like proteases [22, 24, 40] . This is in agreement with the previous bioinformatic findings showing a decrease in the affinity of Losartan for PLpro in the presence of UBl1 (Fig. 7, Fig. 8 ) [27] . It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 PLpro prefers deISGylation 10 times more than deubiquitination [14] . However, our study demonstrated that Losartan in 2.25mM concentration could completely suppress cleavage of monoubiquitin molecules from polyubiquitin chains by PLpro (Fig.1, Fig. 2 ).",

Assuming that intracellular pH is near 7 and drops in the context of intracellular ROS overproduction in inflammations like what happens in COVID-19 [27, 51] , active site of PLpro finds a favorable milieu to cleave nsps efficiently. As a general catalytic reaction, papain-like protease thiolate ion of cysteine produces a tetrahedral intermediate by attacking the carbonyl group of the substrate which is then released through protonation by ImH + (Fig. 9 ) [50] . A MD analysis [52] revealed that tertiary structure and folding of PLpro in its cleavage cleft changes cysteine (C111) and histidine (H272) to negatively charged deprotonated cysteine and positively charged doubly protonated histidine, respectively. In this context, negatively charged aspartic acid (D286) aids in stabilization of positively charged histidine (H272) [52] . In fact, imidazole ring is a unique structure in biologic reactions, which by possessing two identical nitrogen atoms, it is responsible for relaying protons from one site to another. If two imidazole rings present closely in the path of proton transfer (ImH + ...Im) an energy barrier may impede the journey of the protons [53] .",

Entry of SARS-CoV-2 is associated with downregulation of ACE2 and a subsequent acute rise in Ang II/angiotensin (1-7) ratio with pro-inflammatory, proapoptotic, and prothrombotic outcomes [72] [73] [74] [75] . In order to control SARS-CoV-2induced inflammatory responses, many experts have been trying to extend the half-life of ACE2, given the protective role of ACE2 in COVID-19 [76] .

As to the fact that ubiquitin and ISG15 do not show any homology with at least nsp2 amino acid sequence, it might be likely that cleavage of nsps by PLpro through the general chemical reaction in the active site (Fig. 9) might be associated with different positioning of nsps in PLpro in comparison with ubiquitin and ISG15. Thus, Losartan by penetrating the active site and altering hydrogen bonds in the three effector residues may interfere with cleavage of nsps. Though, this assumption needs further investigation, as an evidence for this concept, our in vitro study showed that 200uM concentration of Losartan could inhibit the cleavage of peptide-AMC containing RLRGG C-terminal sequence up to 35.1% \u00b1 2.7 while at the same concentration, this compound could only inhibit cleavage of ISG15",

Conclusion: COVID-19 has resulted in widespread social, economic, and healthcare crisis. Addition of effective antiviral successful vaccination and antiviral treatment strategy against SARS-CoV-2 would greatly aid in the control of this pandemic. Losartan in this study showed weak inhibitory effect on viral PLpro deubiquitinase and deISGylase properties. This study also showed that Losartan added to the cell culture of Vero E6 cells prior to and after infection of the cells with SARS-CoV2 can inhibit SARS-CoV-2 cell destruction and replication. This, if validated by ongoing clinical trials in different continents, may mean that Losartan has both prophylactic and therapeutic effects in the treatment of COVID-19. Additional experiments are needed to better assess the structural changes in the viral proteins and their biological products when exposed to Losartan. Outcome of these experiments may provide a viable pathway for antiviral design and development. If validated in clinical trials, Losartan with its inhibitory effect on viral replication and its significant benefits in cell protection without any cell toxicity may play an important role in slowing the spread of the disease, medical management of individuals unresponsive to vaccination or new mutations, easing healthcare cost and burden in communities globally.",
