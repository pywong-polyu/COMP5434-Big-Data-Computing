In the age of digital electronic information and telecommunication technology, scalable telehealth services are gaining immense importance by helping to maintain social distances while providing necessary healthcare services. This paper aims to review the various types of scalable telehealth services used to support patients infected by COVID-19 and other diseases during this pandemic. Recently published research papers collected from various sources such as Google Scholar, ResearchGate, PubMed, Scopus, and IEEE Xplore databases using the terms \"Telehealth\", \"Coronavirus\", \"Scalable\" and \"COVID-19\" are reviewed. The input data and relevant reports for the analysis and assessment of the various aspects of telehealth technology in the COVID-19 pandemic are taken from official websites. We described the available telehealth systems based on their communication media such as mobile networks, social media, and software based models throughout the review. A comparative analysis among the reviewed systems along with necessary challenges and possible future directions are also drawn for the proper selection of affordable technologies. The usage of scalable telehealth systems improves the quality of the healthcare system and also reduces the infection rate while keeping both patients and doctors safe during the pandemic.",

To reduce mass transmissions, travel restrictions have been established and enforced around the world, and most of the cities have been quarantined. In this situation, it is difficult to take treatment from specialists at the clinic or hospital in person [6, 7] . In the age of modern technology of mobile communication [8] [9] [10] and virtual reality [11, 12] , telehealth is the ideal system for such kind of communicable disease [13] . The evolution of telecommunication technologies plays a key role in the ability of telehealth services to exchange valid information for diagnosis and management of diseases and injuries [14, 15] . There are various types of telehealth systems based on the working principle and method. In a typical telehealth system, patients and doctors are connected by a media which is used to transfer patient medical data to doctor and necessary prescriptions are delivered to the patient. Medical data from patients is acquired by using different types of Body Sensor Network (BSN). Scalability refers to the property of a system to accommodate growing amounts of work by adding resources to the system. Scalable telehealth systems can accommodate the rapidly growing number of coronavirus patients by introducing more resources such as doctors, specialists, artificial assistants, etc. A typical scalable telehealth service with proper functionality is depicted in Fig. 1 .",

The developed system measured temperature, heart rate, respiratory rate, and blood pressure using the Body Sensor Network, which are the most important parameters for monitoring the condition of COVID-19 patients. It consists of three subsystems (1) Input subsystem to collect medical information, (2) Local subsystem to transmit data using GSM cellular network, and (3) Remote subsystem to receive and show on a website. A compact and user-friendly telehealth system was developed by Suganthi et al. [25] using GSM/General Packet Radio Service (GPRS), global positioning system (GPS), and peerto-peer (P2P) technology. The proposed system consists of a temperature sensor, Blood Pressure (BP) measurement sensor, pulse counter clip, and non-invasive glucose monitoring sensor. Using the GPS module, the location of patients and the necessary data are saved in the web server and delivered through a short message service (SMS) to the pre-configured doctor's phone. For continuous monitoring, if any abnormality is found, then an emergency flag is raised to the doctors automatically. Besides, in emergency cases, an automatic call is generated to the doctor and the doctor can hear any voice or messages from the site of the patient. During the COVID-19 pandemic situation, this type of telehealth system can help in early and distance treatment for COVID-19 and other patients. Using similar technologies, TeleHealth Emergency (THE) system is implemented in [26] . In this system, a tele-bio wristwatch is used which consists of some sensors like BP, pulse rate, temperature, and GSM/GPRS and GPS module. The developed watch works like a telephone for the GSM module and can locate the patient's position using GPS. A speaker and call button in this watch help to make emergency call and a red alert button notify the patient for abnormal BP, heart rate, or temperature. In primary treatment, THE can play an important role.",

The described system has services to provide Electrocardiography (ECG), blood sugar, oxygen saturation (SpO2), and patient health record database to the doctor, pharmacist, technician, social worker, etc. using a 3G network system. In another research, a novel architecture is presented in [28] using the GSM module. The proposed system consists of some sensor transducers, Analog to Digital (A/D) converter, an embedded processor, a transceiver in a sensor node, and a GSM shield interface, Arduino, and an encoder as a 5G enhancer. The collected data is routed via GSM voice and control channels to the doctor. Due to the COVID-19 outbreak and lockdown situation, the treatment of other diseases is also being delayed. The developed system can provide proper facilities to the patient having a serious heart problem. A GSM mobile communication network based system is proposed in [29] which is used to provide an emergency diagnosis to COVID-19 patients. The system allows transmission of various bio-signal like 3-12 lead ECG signal, SpO2, noninvasive blood pressure amplifier (NIBP), invasive blood pressure (IBP), and temperature through the GSM network. The still images of patients are also transmitted using the proposed system. While GSM is not available, the transmission is performed through satellite links and plain old telephony system (POTS). Using this device, the doctor can telemetrically move to the patient and treat them properly. The available telehealth systems based on mobile networks are summarized in Table 1 .",

In this type of telehealth system, doctors and other specialized radiologists are connected to such a social platform [32, 33] . They can monitor the patient's regular condition and prescribe them via message or video call. Recently in Iran, a social media based system [34] is proposed based on WhatsApp and email platform. The image or video of patients is delivered in JPG or MP4 version to the volunteer of the developed system. The volunteers post these images to a private group of radiologists and specialists where the confidentiality of data is maintained properly. Only some registered volunteers and coordinator radiologists accessed this private group for generating reports for certain cases. A preliminary report is delivered to patients in image format through email or WhatsApp message having necessary data and instructions. The system is developed only for chest image now. The developed system can deliver faster service of teleradiology and can eliminate the need for overpopulated hospitals. Besides, a video conferencing and email based telehealth system is described in [35] . The developed system is proposed for adult patients. This study provides consultation or advice to health providers through email or video conferencing. The use of public transportation is eliminated by using this system.",

Many apps will not disclose the real health problems and users should not use their actual name due to privacy reasons. Users can send requests to friends and accept or reject requests from other users. Similarly, Care Deliver Frame (CDF) [37] is one kind of telehealth system based on social networking. The developed system is designed for older adults having a communication platform with their family members. Data from various sensors or devices such as blood pressure/glucose meters and weight scales are transmitted to mobile using Bluetooth. The collected data are posted on the patient's Facebook timeline via message, photo, or video module. Children's family members or pre-allocated professional caregivers access this data via mobile or computer from the Facebook database under appropriate Facebook privacy settings. 'Comm & Care' app is used to retrieve vital signs measurement data from the patient's timeline by professional caregivers. HC3i.cn [38] is another social media platform for telehealth extensively used in China. The first internet-based platform focuses on health informatics, internet-based medicine, and mHealth in China. The patients can receive consultation from physicians at home. The social media based telehealth systems that are frequently used are shown in Table 2 .",

In certain instances, video cameras or other acquisition panels are required as additional equipment in telehealth software [39, 40] . During the COVID-19 pandemic, such type of telehealth system can play a significant role in faster treatment [41] . Several telehealth services are available through software nowadays. Magdalena et al. [42] presented a new telemedicine application named NEMESIS using Java programming language. The developed system can acquire, visualize, and revise the ECG signal and transmit it among several medical stations. It has video conference and electronic mail module to communicate with specialists. The main feature of this system is that it has knowledge database access where all the records are saved and encrypted. Recently, VITASENIOR-MT [43] is introduced as another platform of telehealth service. The proposed system has three parts including a wireless sensor network (WSN), VITABOX, and cloud. VITABOX which is one kind of medical equipment collects data from the patient's body using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) biometric sensors. Blood pressure, heart rate, weight, oximetry, and blood glucose are measured by these sensors and sent it to the cloud. Only associated doctors can access these data from the cloud using any web browser. A new telehealth system is designed and implemented for prenatal management in [44] . The developed system consists of a server, prenatal data assistant, and a workstation for an electronic health record. At first, the patient is required to complete registration with email and password through payment transactions. Then, the software collects data such as present and past medical history, family member history, menstrual history, obstetric history, gynecological history, and immunization history from the patient. The main part of this software is the routine checkup part which is important for good patient monitoring. Doctors or specialists check patient data from the website and make teleconsultation and prescription to the patients. In the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic situation, this type of telehealth system can play a vital role in the treatment of obstetrics patients.",

The key specification of this system is obtaining and transferring the information of the client, finding a problem, and confirming client safety, informing urgency to co-medical and clinician, and providing health care advice. An object-oriented method named Unified Modeling Language (UML) is used to develop this software. Similarly, a modern telehealth scheme is introduced in [46] based on neurofuzzy technology. It consists of a tele-practitioner terminal, a patient terminal, and a web-based central station. In both the tele-practitioner terminal and the patient terminal, Embedded Expert System (EMES) is used to serve the embedded intelligent agent for telecommunication and information management. Besides, in the central station, a database and EMES modules are used to store the patient's personal information and medical data. XML is used between database and terminal for data transmission. The most popular, simple, and safe telehealth software in recent times is \"Doxy.me\" [47] . It has a free trial version as well as a paid version. The key features of this site are video conferencing, one-to-one messaging, group calling, screen sharing, and file-sharing options between clients and specialists. This web-based telehealth platform is integrated with Electronic Health Records (EHR) and Practice Management (PM) software. In another research, advanced telehealth software \"AMC Health\" [48] is developed for health monitoring via the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved medical instruments. It involves monitoring and Bluetooth communication, which can be provided either by the patient or caregiver to allow remote devices to work. In the COVID-19 situation, AMC Health provides probable diagnosis using their kit that includes Bluetooth at home peripheral devices and smart devices tablets for patients requiring e-visit.

Also, a lot of developing and under-developed countries do not have sufficiently advanced healthcare systems or expertise in a global pandemic. Telehealth technologies not only reduce the risk of infection of healthcare professionals, but also bridge the gap among countries to provide emergency services to people who need it regardless of nationality, gender, race, caste, or religion. The reviewed systems are scalable in the sense that, the systems can accommodate the growing number of infected patients by increasing the number of interested specialists and doctors in the platforms. However, most of the systems are depended on the doctor's or specialist's feedback. Modern machine learning [49] and artificial intelligence [50] [51] [52] technology may improve the quality of early detection and proper direction in healthcare and aid the doctors in faster detection. Proper guidelines to use telehealth technology alongside general clinical measures should also be developed to fight against the ongoing pandemic. Integrated telehealth systems including proper sensory and networking hardware can also be developed for providing proper support in rural areas.",
