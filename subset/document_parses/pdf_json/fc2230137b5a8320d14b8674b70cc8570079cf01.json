Drawing on career construction theory, we received 408 valid surveys from rural Chinese dwellers and examined the relationships rural Chinese have among \"face consciousness,\" indecisiveness, career adaptability, and entrepreneurial intention. We found that those who are fearful of losing face are less likely to have entrepreneurial intentions, but one's desire to gain face has no significant direct impact on entrepreneurial intention. In addition, face consciousness and an indecisive personality interact to influence career adaptability and, in turn, entrepreneurial intention. In sum, this study supports the career construction perspective on understanding the formation of entrepreneurial intention and offers theoretical, practical, and policy implications for entrepreneurial career counseling and training.",

It has been predicted that, by 2050, over two-thirds of the world's population will reside in urban areas, a 13.4% increase from 2018 (United Nations, Department of Economic and Social Affairs, Population Division, 2019). These changes have an extremely significant impact on rural populations as agricultural land is reduced and residents in these regions adapt to the new turbulent environment that urbanization brings, with many turning to entrepreneurial opportunities. The degree of industrialization and commercialization of rural areas and the loss of farmer's land are found to influence positively the likelihood of rural people becoming private entrepreneurs (Chen, 2006) . A reform based on \"voluntary cooperatives\" with the emphasis on new business cooperation among villagers in the early 2000s promoted the birth of many township enterprises created by rural capable people. These rural entrepreneurs contribute to the development of rural community prosperity (Lan et al., 2014) .",

The global financial crisis in 2008 heavily affected the performance of Chinese export-oriented firms, including township enterprises. Rural migrant workers were often factory-floor people and suffered a lay-offs problem. The government encouraged jobless migrants to return home to farm or start new businesses (Chan, 2010) . The current rural revitalization strategy initiated by the Chinese government involves a process of land transfer from rural individual households to new economic bodies (e.g., family farms, farmer cooperatives, or agribusiness firms) (Wu and Liu, 2020) , which, on one side, promotes the creation of new business; on the other side pushes land lost farmers to migrate to urban areas.",

These studies explore antecedents of entrepreneurial intention or entrepreneurial performance, yet little existing literature is devoted to studying the entrepreneurial intention of rural dwellers who have lost their farmland and have to move to urban areas due to industrialization and urbanization. Whether rural dwellers are able to survive in cities through entrepreneurship or are employed decisively affects social stability and sustainable economic development. Career construction is a must for these rural dwellers to consider. Previous studies show that social cognitive factors, such as personal attributes (Bandura, 1986) , readiness, orientation, and information (Kulcsar et al., 2020) , as well as career adaptability (Savickas, 2005) , influence career behaviors. Rural dwellers in China have been immersed in their local culture and possess specific culture-based personal attributes such as \"Mianzi\" (face). We ask if the view of face has a positive effect on their career construction. Are they capable of coping with unprecedent changes (e.g., loss of farmland, need to survive in cities, etc.)? These questions remain underexplored. As entrepreneurship is often a more personal decision than being employed, it is of great importance to study what factors influence the entrepreneurial intention of Chinese rural dwellers from a career construction perspective.",

This is because the formation of intention precedes the actual behavior (Ajzen, 1991; Douglas et al., 2021) . In view of its important role in the entrepreneurial career process, researchers have devoted considerable effort to examine the antecedents of entrepreneurial intention (e.g., Wilson et al., 2007; Al-Jubari et al., 2019; Ramos-Rodr\u00edguez et al., 2019; Botha and Taljaard, 2021) . In a comprehensive review of previous studies on entrepreneurial intention, Li\u00f1\u00e1n and Fayolle (2015) point out that the literature consists of two distinct strands of research: one from social psychology focuses on analyzing the psychological process leading from attitudes and cognitions to effective action (e.g., Bandura, 1986; Ajzen, 1991; Botha and Taljaard, 2021) ; the other examines the field of entrepreneurship, entrepreneurial events, for example (Shapero and Sokol, 1982) . These studies have made major contributions to understanding entrepreneurial intention and, therefore, career paths chosen. Inspired by the extant literature, we adopted career construction theory to explore what social cognitive factors impact the entrepreneurial intention of rural dwellers in Sichuan province, China.",

However, these existing theories do not emphasize that careers are built to express an individual's selfconcept that reinforces his or her goals in the reality of work roles (Lent and Brown, 2013) nor do they consider that career development should be driven by adaptation to the environment (Savickas, 2005) . Career construction theory (CCT) is one of the contemporary career theories developed since the mid-2000s and has been widely used to study career adaptability (Baruch and Sullivan, 2022) . As entrepreneurship is widely regarded as a career choice (Liguori et al., 2020; Marshall and Gigliotti, 2020) , entrepreneurship scholars have emphasized a careers perspective that suggests the decision to start a new venture could be thought of as one of many options individuals consider in structuring a meaningful life (Burton et al., 2016) . This perspective argues that career experiences and competences can shape entrepreneurial activity. Indeed, several studies in the field of career psychology have brought career theory into entrepreneurship research to examine the antecedents of entrepreneurial career intention (e.g., Pfeifer et al., 2016; Liguori et al., 2018; P\u00e9rez-L\u00f3pez et al., 2019) and found that career beliefs and abilities affect the formation of entrepreneurial intention. For instance, Chu et al. (2011) found that entrepreneurs in China's major industrial cities of Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou were mostly motivated by increasing income, becoming their own boss, and to prove that they can succeed. But because a major problem they encountered was a lack of management training, they suggested that policy makers improve management skills and provide technical assistance.",

This study seeks to complement earlier work on entrepreneurial intention (e.g., Tolentino et al., 2014; Obschonka et al., 2018) that was rooted in a career construction theory and emphasized the adaptation process. Career construction theory (CCT) emphasizes that individuals construct themselves and their careers with career development driven by adaptation to the environment (Savickas, 2005) . Career adaptability is the core psychological construct of CCT, which means \"an individual's resources for coping with current and anticipated tasks, transitions, traumas in his or her occupational roles that, to some degree, large or small, alter his or her social integration\" (Savickas and Porfeli, 2012, p. 662) . Given that social face consciousness is a critical individual internal cognitive state that influences Chinese people's intentions and behaviors (Huang et al., 2011; Yu et al., 2019) , we aim to explain Confucian culture's association with entrepreneurial intention. Although scholars have pointed out a relationship before (e.g., Begley and Tan, 2001) , this argument has not been fully verified. Moreover, no research to our knowledge has investigated the underlying mechanism through which face consciousness affects entrepreneurial intention.",

Career construction requires career adaptability, meaning being ready to cope with uncertainties from unpredictable shifts in their job and working conditions (Savickas, 1997) . Many studies have argued the antecedents and consequences of career adaptability in predicting positive career-related outcomes (Jiang, 2017; Zhuang et al., 2018; Gao et al., 2019; Ayala et al., 2020; Mei et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2021) . As Obschonka et al. (2018) have indicated career adaptability is important in responding to the uncertain environment in one's occupational development. However, the existing literature primarily targets university students as samples and pays little attention to personal traits with local culture characteristics. Consistent with the core construct of CCTcareer adaptability (Baruch and Sullivan, 2022) , our study's roots are in the Chinese cultural context and argues that face consciousness (enhancement vs. saving) of rural people will impact career adaptability, in turn, shaping the intent to pursue an entrepreneurship career.",

Indecisiveness has received much attention in the field of career decision-making because it plays a critical role in influencing a person's decision-making process, with indecisive individuals generally encountering greater difficulty across domains and situations (Ng and Hynie, 2014) . As suggested by Burton et al. (2016) , entrepreneurship is one of the many complex life-course-related choices. Thus, it is possible that it will be difficult for indecisive individuals to adapt to changing conditions and make decisions on their entrepreneurial careers. If so, it is important to examine how indecisiveness interacts with culturally related personality in choosing an entrepreneurship career. In sum, we integrated career construct theory with the literature on face consciousness to develop an additional perspective on why some rural Chinese dwellers are inclined to be entrepreneurs.",

First, we conducted an empirical test of whether different dimensions of social face consciousness exert different effects on the career construction process of entrepreneurial intentions. In doing so, we provided a possible explanation of how entrepreneurial intentions are shaped by specific cultural factors. Second, our work expands recent efforts to synthesize the career construction theory, career adaptability, and pieces of entrepreneurial intention literature by identifying the mediating role of career adaptability in the relationship between face consciousness and entrepreneurial intentions. Beyond illustrating the potential effect of individual differences, examining this mediating effect may further provide an in-depth understanding of the career construction processes underlying the emergence of entrepreneurial intentions. Third, we explored differences between \"fear of losing face\" (risk) and \"desire to gain face\" (reward) on career adaptability. In this respect, our study contributes to a rather comprehensive understanding of why some rural Chinese dwellers are more susceptible than others to the effects of \"face\" on career adaptability. The theoretical model is shown in Figure 1 .",

Finally, culture can be strong or weak, and it can FIGURE 1 | Theoretical model. Frontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org be dominant or have numerous sub-cultures. Hofstede and Bond (1988) subsequently added traditional Confucian values in explaining entrepreneurial success and economic growth. These factors (similar to the Western Protestant Ethic) include delaying self-gratification for the sake of future benefits; self-discipline, hard work, persistence, and thriftiness; having a sense of shame; supporting interrelatedness through sensitivity to social contacts; and considering education to be very important.",

Face is lost when an individual fails to meet essential requirements expected by virtue of the occupied social position. By connecting people in a specific social structure, face directs their behavior to conform to the local culture as they strive to enhance this positive social value and protect it from being lost (Bao et al., 2003 ).

For Chinese rural dwellers, \"Mianzi\" means reciprocity, social appraisal, good reputation, and high social status. Social appraisal arises from personal capability, interactions with local villagers, and performance in rural community affairs (Dong and Guo, 2017) . For historical and institutional reasons, rural dwellers do not have industrial jobs and access to (at least basic) social welfare and full citizenship that urban people do (Chan, 2010) . They live in rural communities, which are comparatively less open compared with urban areas but preserve a more traditional Confucian culture. This is partially related to their affiliation to farmland for generations. However, the large-scale migration of rural dwellers to urban areas since the 1980s freed them from their attachment to farmland and created a desire to fend for themselves. Since more money or wealth is widely viewed as having more \"Mianzi\" (Dong and Guo, 2017) , entrepreneurs gain \"Mianzi\" (e.g., reputation, social status, high social appraisal, honor, prestige, respect) as they return home, and their strong personal capability to earn more money contributes to rural community prosperity.",

Similarly, there is a duality to \"face consciousness\": the simultaneous desire to gain face and fear of losing face (Zhang et al., 2011) . In the present study, we propose that each dimension of face consciousness is simultaneously present and has a different influence on entrepreneurial intentions. On the one hand, the desire to gain face (reward) will drive some to be an entrepreneur. China's recent economic policies intending to facilitate mass entrepreneurship and innovation should motivate individuals to choose a socially encouraged entrepreneurial career path that will secure social legitimacy and gain face. For instance, Lau and Busenitz (2001) found that Chinese entrepreneurs' need for achievement determined their growth intentions. Additionally, entrepreneurship can be a feasible way to raise one's earnings potential (Murnieks et al., 2020) . Compared with \"working for others, \" \"being a boss\" means certain power, which is a career choice that can improve social status for those who otherwise have limited employment opportunities. In this respect, the desire to gain face may create outcome expectations (e.g., higher income, self-esteem, and self-actualization) that lead to career goals (e.g., trigger entrepreneurial intention) in China.",

Empirical studies suggest that individuals who are afraid of being embarrassed or do not want to lose face tend to avoid risky events. For instance, a study in the Chinese cultural context found that individuals tend to decrease help-seeking behaviors to avoid being rejected by others (Lei and Tang, 2015) . Due to the high uncertainty of entrepreneurship success (Wennberg et al., 2013) , those choosing an entrepreneurial career are vulnerable to business failure. The more people are afraid of failure, the less they are willing to start a business (Kong et al., 2020) . In a shamebased society like China, failure is a serious threat to saving face (Begley and Tan, 2001) . In this regard, a person who has a deep fear of losing face would anticipate such undesirable results as lost earnings, ridicule, and family conflicts. These potential outcomes would make them hesitant or even fearful of starting a new business. Taken together, we propose the following hypotheses:",

            "text": "Individual differences regarding a flexible personality or willingness to change denote those who are more likely to adapt (Savickas and Porfeli, 2012; Guan et al., 2017) . Face consciousness is considered as a relatively stable personality that influences Chinese cognitive and affective reactions when they interact with others (Chou, 1996; Cheung et al., 2008) . Career adaptability is defined as \"self-regulation strengths or capacities that a person may draw upon to solve the unfamiliar, complex, and ill-defined problems presented by developmental vocational tasks, occupational transitions, and work traumas\" (Savickas and Porfeli, 2012, p. 663) . It is measured by concern (such as for one's future), control (making one's own decisions), curiosity (exploring opportunities while developing possible selves), and confidence (overcoming obstacles) (Savickas and Porfeli, 2012) . In view of the different behavioral implications of \"desire to gain face\" and \"fear of losing face, \" we argue that these two distinct face needs have different effects on career adaptability. Individuals with a need for face would be motivated to consider their future, expect positive outcomes, make their own decisions, and take actions that will manage and disseminate positive images, display their strengths, and behave in line with social norms so as to attain social acclaim (Huang et al., 2011) . Hence, those concerned with gaining face have a high need for achievement, are willing to take risks to achieve their goals, and may appear assertive and confident (Chou, 1996) . For them, a dynamic environment is not always a threat but offers good business opportunities. Therefore, we can conclude that those who are having a high face-gaining orientation tend to actively engage the changing environment, set challenging goals, engage in self-promoting behaviors to be recognized by others, and solve occupational transition problems. In sum, the \"desire to gain face\" is a motivational factor that facilitates adaptability.",

When Chinese people cannot gain face during social interactions, at least they protect its damage (Ho, 1976) since losing face may induce such negative emotions as shame and depression (Begley and Tan, 2001; Huang et al., 2011) . Because individuals who are afraid to lose face are sensitive to the potential threat of being looked down upon by others, they tend to exhibit cautious and withdrawal behaviors (Chou, 1996) . Those who fear losing face will avoid sharing information and knowledge, thereby hindering career adaptability (Gong and Li, 2019) . For example, empirical studies have shown conscious face saving to be negatively related to knowledge sharing intentions (Huang et al., 2011) . Students have been reluctant to seek feedback in class because of their fear of losing face (Hwang et al., 2003) . As the 21st century experiences more rapid changes than ever, uncertainty is undoubtedly higher than before. The advancement of information technology accelerates the transfer of negative stories further and faster than before. Fear of losing face causes people to be concerned about their future, lack courage and confidence to explore business opportunities, incapable of making their own decisions, unable to take risks, and hinder exchanges of information and knowledge; all of which make people unwilling to adapt to the changing environment. Therefore, we propose that:",

It is vital for individuals to develop and determine the optimal strategy to guide their adaptive behaviors (Rudolph et al., 2017; Johnston, 2018; Peng et al., 2021) . Indeed, recent studies have argued that career adaptability might be a significant predictor of entrepreneurial intentions because highly adaptable individuals possess self-regulation strengths that enable them to better identify business opportunities, mobilize resources, and fit into uncertain circumstances (Tolentino et al., 2014) . In their research from student samples, Tolentino et al. (2014) demonstrated that entrepreneurship is a vocational strategy that can be driven by individuals' career adaptabilities. Moreover, the four types of adaptability resources (i.e., concern, control, curiosity, and confidence) reflect self-efficacy and a tendency to make the effort to prepare for and explore a satisfactory career path (Savickas and Porfeli, 2012) . In this respect, it is plausible that those who are better able to adapt will more proactively explore and prepare for entrepreneurship than those with lower career adaptability.

These individuals are more likely to interpret uncertainty as a threat, thus delaying or even avoiding making decisions in complex and ambiguous situations (Rassin and Muris, 2005) . Such fear of uncertainty will be magnified when a person is simultaneously afraid of losing face and is indecisive, resulting in unwillingness to change the status quo and hesitance in making decisions (Sautua, 2017) .

Although from a specific context, Sichuan is a representative province for conducting research about the career development process rural dwellers face since this sample reflects rural entrepreneurship. Historically known as China's breadbasket, it is one of the leading Chinese provinces in terms of agricultural production and, hence, dominated by farm workers. In recent years, rapid urbanization and industrialization have brought tremendous changes to its rural areas. Until 2017, the urbanization rate was 50.79%, passing 50% for the first time (Hou and Fan, 2019) .",

This study instrument was approved by the academic ethics committee of the Southwestern University of Finance and Economics. Thanks to the help of the local government demolition bureau, we obtained living addresses of rural dwellers, randomly selected one of the living communities (Yucheng District in Ya'an, which is located in the west of Sichuan Basin and reachable by public transportation), and then made a one-on-one household survey, with each family selecting either one male host, one female host, or both to participate in the early stages of the investigation on January 06, 2020. However, the door-to-door survey was interrupted due to the outbreak of COVID-19. Because only 56 valid surveys out of 100 were returned, we shifted on January 20, 2020 from the on-site survey to an online survey through a widely used platform in China called \"Wen Juan Zhi Xing.\" We employed a snowball sampling technique through referrals among the people who had completed the questionnaire in January. The criteria for the participants are they must be Chinese rural dwellers; understand Mandarin; have access to the Internet; and are not entrepreneurs at the survey moment. Those who did not meet these criteria were excluded from participation. For assuring the participants were able to answer the digital survey, we left a contact cellphone number in the survey so they could inquire if needed. The referrals familiar with the online survey also agreed to help these participants answer an E-VERSION survey. The participation was voluntary, with all the participants being informed about the purpose of the study and that the data would remain anonymous. To motivate participation, those who were completing the questionnaire received a modest incentive (i.e., a small gift or minor cash payments) after submitting the survey. As of August 31, 2020, 408 valid questionnaires in total were included in the final analysis (a response rate of 92.1%), excluding those with missing information, same answers, or completed in too short a time. We believe the high rate of response is due to the easy-to-understand survey content, our participation incentive, and the high voluntary participation of rural dwellers.",

We followed the widely used three-step procedure (e.g., Jiang, 2017) to test for these effects. All focal predictors were mean centered before the analysis (Aiken and West, 1991) . The results of Model 3 display a significant and negative interaction of desire to gain face and indecisiveness in predicting career adaptability (\u03b2 = \u22120.166, p < 0.01), suggesting that indecisiveness lessened the positive effect of desire to gain face on career adaptability. Figure 2 depicts the simple slopes for the interaction effect between desire to gain face and career adaptability, which is significant when decisive (b = 0.253, SE = 0.045, p < 0.001) but not when indecisive (b = 0.035, SE = 0.055, ns). This is consistent with H5a. Likewise, the results in Model 4 show that the interactive effect of fear of losing face and indecisiveness on career adaptability is negative and significant (\u03b2 = \u22120.107, p < 0.05). As indicated in Figure 3 , the relationship between fear of losing face and career adaptability is more negative when indecisiveness is high (b = 0.225, SE = 0.052, p < 0.001) than when indecisiveness is low (b = \u22120.072, SE = 0.054, ns). Hence, H5b was supported. The regression results are summarized in Figure 4 . The major plausible relationships of these results are as follows: (1) Risk of losing face has a significant negative influence on entrepreneurial intention, but the reward of gaining face by itself, while positive, is not significant; (2) Face consciousness has a significant impact on career adaptability, with risk of losing face being negative and reward of gaining face being positive; (3) This influence of face consciousness on career adaptability is reduced when an individual is indecisive regardless of fear of risk or desire of reward; and (4) Career adaptability has a highly significant influence on entrepreneurial intention.",

First, by investigating the effect of face consciousness (i.e., desire to gain face and fear of losing face) on entrepreneurial intention, we add to the existing knowledge of the antecedents of entrepreneurial intent. Although prior research has provided valuable insights into its drivers (e.g., Tolentino et al., 2014; Pfeifer et al., 2016; P\u00e9rez-L\u00f3pez et al., 2019) , relatively little attention has been focused on the influence of specific cultural constructs. Culture contributes to shaping an entrepreneurial mindset and influences regional rates of entrepreneurship (Hayton et al., 2002; Schlaegel et al., 2013; Karimi et al., 2021) . Our survey results found that distinct face needs will affect entrepreneurial intentions in different ways. Specifically, fear of losing face will significantly hinder entrepreneurial intention, whereas the desire to gain face, while positive, is not significant in explaining entrepreneurial intention. This suggests that at least for Chinese rural dwellers' entrepreneurial career construction, fear of failure outweighs the possibility of success. This finding is consistent with prior literature, positing that face-gaining consciousness would be less primary and less important than face-saving consciousness in an Asian culture (Chou, 1996; Kim and Nam, 1998) and enriches the existing career construction theory.",

Serial entrepreneurs in the West are willing to take risks to achieve success, hoping that the one big hit compensates for the many small misses. Moreover, bankruptcy laws minimize the stigma of failure. Either way, they accept risk and manage to mitigate losses in pursuing abnormal returns. On the other hand, we show that China's rural dwellers are more concerned about \"losing face, \" especially when indecisive in forming entrepreneurial intentions. Therefore, entrepreneurship education courses should be connected to a specific cultural context for those Chinese regions seeking to stimulate the growth of new businesses. For example, role-model exposure that allows prospective entrepreneurs to learn from other failure experiences can mitigate the fear and embarrassment of losing face. Showing the universality and even benefits of entrepreneurial failure (Lee and Miesing, 2017) would signal that, while risk trumps return, failure need not be a disgrace. Furthermore, entrepreneurship education should be designed to improve rural dwellers' self-efficacy beliefs, guide them to have rational outcome expectations, set appropriate goals, and strengthen their career adaptability.",

For instance, entrepreneurship training programs should cultivate career adaptability, considering its importance in facilitating entrepreneurial intentions. Courses that focus on self-and environment explorations could be introduced to help entrepreneurs better understand their professional ability and match to potential career opportunities, which are beneficial to developing their career adaptability.",

Obviously, our sample is from a very specific context, and Western countries may have different levels of sensitivity to face consciousness than do East Asians (Begley and Tan, 2001) . Bruton et al. (2018) argue that scholars are myopic by relying on Western perspectives of entrepreneurship and should instead examine the variety and diversity of \"indigenous entrepreneurship activities\" found elsewhere. While we did that, it is equally important that our theoretical perspective be verified in Western cultures. In addition to non-Confucius societies, future studies can also be conducted in urban regions or different political-economic environments. While we proposed and tested the moderating role of indecisiveness on the relationship between face consciousness and career adaptability, there may be other critical variables influencing the career construction processes. For example, social support and barriers may promote or hinder career adaptability (Han and Rojewski, 2014; Pajic et al., 2018) . Because the participants self-reported our study variables at one time, we encourage replications to collect multisource and longitudinal data. Having adopted a Chinese version of the existing and widely used scales that are suitable in the Chinese context to measure our variables, we are happy to offer without reservation the data used in our study to readers requesting them for replication.",
