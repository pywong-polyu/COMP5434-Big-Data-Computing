            "text": "COVID-19 is the most disturbing pandemic of the past hundred years. Its causative agent, the SARS-CoV-2 virus, has been the subject of an unprecedented investigation to characterize its molecular structure and intimate functioning. While markers for its detection have been proposed and several diagnostic methodologies developed, its propensity to evolve and evade diagnostic tools and the immune response is of great concern. The recent spread of new variants with increased infectivity requires even more attention. Here, we document how shotgun proteomics can be useful for rapidly monitoring the evolution of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. We evaluated the heterogeneity of purified SARS-CoV-2 virus obtained after culturing in the Vero E6 cell line. We found that cell culture induces significant changes that are translated at the protein level, such changes being detectable by tandem mass spectrometry. Production of viral particles requires careful quality control which can be easily performed by shotgun proteomics. Although considered relatively stable so far, the SARS-CoV-2 genome turns out to be prone to frequent variations. Therefore, the sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 variants from patients reporting only the consensus genome after its amplification would deserve more attention and could benefit from more in-depth analysis of low level but crystal-clear signals, as well as complementary and rapid analysis by shotgun proteomics.",

            "text": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS CoV-2) belongs to the genus Betacoronavirus (lineage B), subgenus Sarbecovirus. It was first described in December 2019 as the virus responsible for the current global COVID-19 pandemic [1] . The \u224830-kb single-stranded RNA genome of SARS-CoV-2 encodes for 4 structural proteins assembled into viral particles and 25 additional proteins required to hijack the molecular machinery of the host and produce copies of the viral RNA and the infective virions [2] . The four structural proteins are the spike (S), membrane (M), envelope (E), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins. These proteins comprise 1273, 222, 75, and 419 amino acids, respectively. The S protein is a glycoprotein that plays a pivotal role in viral attachment, fusion, and entry into host cells [3] . The precursor protein is cleaved into two subunits, an N-terminal S1 subunit responsible for the attachment to the host and a C-terminal S2 subunit mediating membrane fusion. Three S1/S2 heterodimers assemble to form a trimer spike protruding from the viral envelope. The membrane (or Matrix) protein is a glycoprotein with a central role in virion assembly and morphogenesis. The envelope (E) protein is a small membrane protein with a single alpha-helical transmembrane domain which plays a central role not only in virus morphogenesis and assembly, but also in pathogenesis during COVID-19 infection as it acts as a viroporin by forming homopentameric protein-lipid pores in the host membrane. The nucleocapsid (N protein-RNA complex) protects and organizes the RNA molecule into the viral lumen. Interestingly, structural studies of viral particles revealed an extensive heterogeneity of its molecular architecture [1] .",

            "text": "Whole SARS-CoV-2 genome sequencing of numerous samples identified different lineages and sub-lineages along with the progressive spread of the virus over the planet and its propensity to evolve by accumulative mutations. Protein structural models highlighted that most substitutions map to protein surfaces and some could help the virus to evade the host immune system response [4] . The specific drastic countermeasures to limit the spread of the virus worldwide such as massive lockdown and COVID-19 shielding measures have increased the selective pressure on the virus. The emergence of new variants with an evident selective advantage such as the B.1.1.7 lineage in England triggers a new phase of the pandemic during autumn 2020 [5] . This lineage possesses not only a large number of non-synonymous substitutions, some being at key locations of the S protein, but also a short deletion that has been the cause of the S-gene target failure in at least one diagnostic PCR test (i.e. the Thermo Fisher TaqPath COVID-19 assay). The appearance of the B.1.351 lineage in South Africa, P.1 variant in Brazil, B.1.617 variant in India, and many others to come that could have major impacts on the course of the pandemic was somehow expected [6, 7] . Furthermore, medical countermeasures such as the use of convalescent plasma to treat patients or the massive vaccination campaign could result in the appearance of new evading variants. Indeed, marked intra-host genomic evolution of SARS-CoV-2 was observed in immunocompromised patients suffering long-term COVID-19 and treated with convalescent plasma [8] .",

Figure 1 shows the workflow for the production and purification of viral particles, as well as the analytical methodologies to characterize the purified virus. Seven flasks corresponding to a total of 7 \u00d7 10 7 cells were infected at MOI 0.001 and cultivated for 3 days before harvest. The viral particles were purified via ultracentrifugation on a sucrose cushion first and a sucrose gradient later, and then pooled as a single production batch. While challenging to perform under the BSL-3 conditions required for handling the SARS-CoV-2 virus, this last step of the purification procedure (Fig. 2) is crucial to remove the majority of the contaminant proteins without negatively impacting the concentration of the recovered viral particles. The infectious titre of the purified virus, as estimated by standard plaque assay, was 1.2 \u00d7 10 3 pfu/\u03bcL. The viral RNA load estimated by RT-qPCR and the protein concentration of the sample were 2.0 \u00d7 10 8 copies/\u03bcL and 0.614 \u03bcg/\u03bcL, respectively. A total of 1.6 mL of viral particles solution was obtained, thus corresponding to 1.9 \u00d7 10 6 pfu and 3.2 \u00d7 10 11 viral particles.

For this, an aliquot of the sample was subjected to in-gel proteolysis and the resulting peptides were analysed by means of three analytical nanoLC-MS/MS analyses. A total of 107,856 MS/MS spectra were acquired when merging the results of the three analytical replicates. Overall, 68,156 MS/MS spectra were assigned to peptide sequences in the first search round. The resulting assignation rate (63.2%) was in accordance with previously obtained results with similar conditions and datasets [14, 15] . Good reproducibility was obtained for the three analytical runs with 12,512, 12,678, and 12,837 peptide-to-spectrum matches. A total of 11,923 peptide sequences were identified, pointing at the confident detection of 1094 proteins with at least two peptide sequences (see Supplementary Information (ESM) Table S1). A total of 9 SARS-CoV-2 proteins were identified: N (49 peptides, 3318 SC), S (78, 2185), M (11, 531), E (2, 3), Orf1ab-1 (21, 50), Orf9b (6, 28), Orf3a (4, 23), Orf8 (1, 2), and Orf1ab-2 (2, 2). Very good coverage of the sequence of the N (83%) and S (50%) proteins was obtained (Fig. 3) . As expected, the number of Chlorocebus proteins (928) was higher than those of the Bos Taurus contaminants (104), with a total protein abundance of 76.1% versus 7.7%, respectively. The most prominent contaminants in the three analytical runs, as judged by their SC, were the Chlorocebus proteins: plectin, heparan sulfate proteoglycan 2, filamin a, myosin heavy chain 9, filamin c, and spectrin alpha. Notwithstanding, their cumulated amounts represented only 8% of the detected proteins. SARS-CoV-2 proteins represented 16.2% of the total. Of note, the dynamic exclusion of 10 s used for recording the data decreases the counts of the most abundant ions. For this reason, viral proteins account probably for a higher percentage. Interestingly, when comparing the profiles of the contaminant proteins obtained by analysing purified viral particles with those resulting from the analysis of infected cell proteome reported previously [11] and acquired under relatively similar conditions, we observed that heparan sulfate proteoglycan 2 (with a fold change \u00d732), myoferlin (\u00d729), integrin beta (\u00d743), epithelial cell adhesion molecule (\u00d726), versican (\u00d719), glypican (\u00d716), copine (\u00d716), and stress-induced phosphoprotein 1 (\u00d772) were among the most enriched proteins from Chlorocebus (see ESM Table S1 ).",

The this mutation at position 135 in the N protein appears to occur at less than 4% compared to the wild-type residue. Figure 5 shows the nucleoprotein sequence with the two detected mutations at the polypeptide sequence level, as well as the nucleotide mutations that could generate these changes. A transversion (Ggc/Agc) in the N gene resulted in the mutation of glycine at position 212 into a serine. This transversion was not reported in the GISAID database. Another single nucleotide transversion (aCt/aTt) could explain the variant observed at position 135. As it was detected in the genomes of several variants, it occurs in a permissive region of the protein. The whole genome sequence confirmed the presence of RNA molecules encompassing the two transversions as shown in Table 2 . C and T nucleotides were detected at position 28,677; the mutated form was detected in 1.9% of the highquality reads. G and A nucleotides were detected at position 28,907; the mutated nucleotide accounted for 0.8% of the reads.

We showed that shotgun proteomics not only allows a comprehensive proteomic description of the subset of host proteins potentially associated with intact virions but highlights the heterogeneity of structural proteins produced by infected cells in vitro. The proteomic profile produced by LC-MS/MS and its comparison with the previously obtained proteome of infected Vero E6 cells revealed an enrichment of Chlorocebus proteins such as heparan sulfate proteoglycan 2, myoferlin, integrin beta, epithelial cell adhesion molecule, versican, glypican, copine, and stress-induced phosphoprotein 1 among the purified virions. Heparan sulfate proteoglycan 2 is a cellsurface endocytosis receptor involved in diverse macromolecular cargo and its role in SARS-CoV-2 cell attachment has been established recently [16] . Myoferlin is a multifunctional protein that was involved in the invasion of tumour cells [17] . Integrin beta is also a cell surface receptor and its role as putative host cell entry was discussed [18] . Versican is a key component of the extracellular matrix involved in cell adhesion, proliferation, and migration. Glypican is a protein anchored to the cell membrane involved in developmental morphogenesis. Copine is a calcium-dependent membrane protein with a role in membrane trafficking. Stress-induced phosphoprotein 1 shows some domain similarities with a mitochondrial import receptor, and thus could be a possible membrane receptor. All these proteins may be enriched in the purified sample due to their strong affinity with SARS-CoV-2 viral particles, potentially via the Spike protein. As exemplified with heparan sulfate proteoglycan 2 (16), these proteins could be involved in SARS-CoV-2 infectious mechanisms and their respective roles are probably worth being further investigated. We identified by tandem mass spectrometry the presence of variants in low but detectable quantities in the purified SARS-CoV-2 viral particles and particularly in the N protein.",

            "text": "At the early stage of the pandemic, the SARS-CoV-2 genome was considered as relatively stable and mainly evolving under the effect of point mutations generally neutral and without impact on virulence and severity [19] . Analysis of SARS-CoV-2 proteome sequences deposited in the GISAID database over the past year showed that SARS-CoV-2 proteins are mutating at substantially different rates, with most of the viral proteins exhibiting little mutational variability while the Spike and Nucleocapsid proteins have the highest one [20] . The emergence of new variants of SARS-CoV-2 called \"variants of concern\" triggered a new phase of the pandemic [5] . Indeed, the virus is currently subjected to a higher pressure than before as it now actively explores its evolutionary space The peptide abundances, expressed as spectral counts per residue, are schematized under the corresponding amino acid polypeptide regions while confronting in higher numbers hosts with an efficient immune response compared to the first versions of SARS-CoV-2 (either infected patients that suffered COVID-19 in the earlier stages of the pandemic or vaccinated subjects). While a vast majority of vaccines are developed for targeting highly conserved regions of the S protein or parts thereof, the N protein is also envisioned for vaccine development [21] . N-Protein variants such as those deciphered in the present study might be important for such developments. While the vaccine evading problem may be a Black Swan theoretical idea [22] , understanding how SARS-CoV-2 evolves and anticipating the response to these novel variants remain of utmost importance [23] . A very recent study based on whole genome SARS-CoV-2 deep sequencing of numerous clinical samples reported low levels of within-host diversity, but a dynamic landscape during infection [24] . The proteomics data indicated that 16% of spectral counts were assigned to viral proteins in the purified fraction, but the dynamic exclusion used for selecting peptide for fragmentation decreases the counts of the most abundant proteins, therefore minoring the viral protein ratio by an important factor. With the protein concentration of the sample being established at 0.614 \u03bcg/\u03bcL, at least 10 ng/\u03bcL of viral proteins is present. The structure of the viral particle revealed the presence of 26 (\u00b115) copies of the S protein and 26 (\u00b111) copies of the ribonucleoprotein N per virion [1] . Thus, the protein content of a SARS-CoV-2 viral particle should have an average molecular weight of \u22485.5 MDa. The sample content in SARS-CoV-2 particles is estimated to be 11 \u00d7 10 8 copies/\u03bcL while the viral RNA load was measured by RT-qPCR to reach 2.0 \u00d7 10 8 copies/\u03bcL; thus, at least one-fifth of the viral proteins could be assembled around a RNA molecule.",

            "text": "It was recently estimated that each infected person could carry 10 9 -10 11 virions during peak infection, but only a fraction of these particles are infective as the 50% tissue culture infective dose (TCID 50 ) was estimated to be 10,000 lower, i.e. 10 5 -10 7 . Here, our purified SARS-CoV-2 viral particles were even less infective (167,000 lower). The total number of virions produced throughout an infection was estimated to be ten times the peak infection load. Therefore, each infected patient could produce 10 10 -10 12 virions; and thus, a great number of variants could be theoretically produced by a single person during their infection as suggested by our experimental results. The latest epidemiological reports mentioned that SARS-CoV-2 has infected over 132 million people, thus multiplying the possibilities of creating new variants by a huge factor. Intra-host genomic plasticity has been reported after genome sequencing of samples from COVID-19 patients. Karamitros et al. [25] described the occurrence of tens of low or higher frequency single nucleotide variations in several viral proteins. This intra-host diversity of SARS-CoV-2 was also found to be host-to-host transmitted [26] . Indeed, SARS-CoV-2 viruses inhabit the host as a population of variants (the so-called quasispecies) and this diversity changes over time. Based on metatranscriptomics, a recent study revealed the coexistence of different genotypes within the same patient [27] . Finally, recent works have shown that in some cells mutations on the spike protein could lead to loss of furin cleavage and become dominant, while wild-type SARS-CoV-2 sequence is maintained at a low percentage [28] . Shotgun proteomics and mass spectrometry could be useful for quickly assessing these variants as the methodology does not rely on amplification of the molecules that could introduce some bias.",

Peptide targets were first proposed based on their mass spectrometry detectability observed by shotgun proteomics on preliminary datasets as well as on their degree of conservation among known variants [29] . Over the last months, several studies have shown how mass spectrometry could be implemented for SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis from gargle samples or nasopharyngeal swabs [30] . Interestingly, these acquisition methods could be quickly adapted to detect new variants as they do not require specific reagents. While the mutations have been identified here from viral particles purified from a cell culture preparation, it is now of utmost interest to test whether mass spectrometry can be used to evaluate SARS-CoV-2 evolution in clinical samples.",

            "text": "In conclusion, the present study shows how shotgun proteomics can be used in routine experiments to easily check for the homogeneity of viral particles preparations. We confirmed that the production of SARS-CoV-2 viruses in the Vero E6 cell line induced the appearance of mutated structural proteins. While top-down analysis of these polypeptides could be of high interest to determine if various mutations could be encompassed per polypeptide, shotgun proteomics allows to quickly identify the positions that are prone to mutations without specific constraints. Clearly, such in vitro experiment indicated that new variants not yet catalogued in GISAID may appear. While genome sequencing of the SARS-CoV-2 genome is still quite tedious depending on the viral charge of the sample, mass spectrometry could be an alternative solution to quickly assess the mutational landscape of any samples. Among the possible applications, this methodology could be helpful to monitor the virus evolution from immunocompromised patients suffering from COVID-19 and subjected to long-term therapy.

The two variant peptides [210-MA(G->S)NGGDAALALLLLDR-226] and [210-MA(G->S)NGGDAALALLLLDRLNQLESK-233] were detected with lower counts, 6 and 7, respectively. Therefore, this mutation at position 122 of the N protein appears to occur at less than 5% compared to the wild-type residue.Another search was performed using a database compiling all the known variant sequences based on the SARS-CoV-2 genomes deposited in GISAID (Proteomic dataset PXD025131). Two additional variant peptides, T\u2192I)EGALNTPKDHIGTR-149], were detected which collectively point at a threonine changed into an isoleucine residue at position 135 in the N protein. This modification was observed in two variants reported in GISAID: hCoV-19/ USA/WI-30/2020|EPI_ISL_421288 and hCoV-19/India/ NCDC-02252/2020|EPI_ISL_435097. In this case, the mutated peptides were detected with lower counts, 14 and 6, respectively, than the wild-type peptides, 234 and 267. Therefore, SARS-CoV-2 purification.
