We have used a novel `gene signature'based drug repositioning strategy by applying widely accepted gene ranking algorithms to prioritize the FDA approved or under trial drugs. We mined publically available RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) data using CLC Genomics Workbench 20 (QIAGEN) and identified 283 differentially expressed genes (FDR<0.05, log2FC>1) after a meta-analysis of three independent studies which were based on severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in primary human airway epithelial cells. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) revealed that SARS-CoV-2 activated key canonical pathways and gene networks that intricately regulate general anti-viral as well as specific inflammatory pathways. Drug database, extracted from the Metacore and IPA, identified 15 drug targets (with information on COVID-19 pathogenesis) with 46 existing drugs as potential-novel candidates for repurposing for COVID-19 treatment. We found 35 novel drugs that inhibit targets (ALPL, CXCL8, and IL6) already in clinical trials for COVID-19. Also, we found 6 existing drugs against 4 potential anti-COVID-19 targets (CCL20, CSF3, CXCL1, CXCL10) that might have novel anti-COVID-19 indications.",

            "text": "International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) named this new CoV as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the disease as CoV disease 2019 [4] . SARS-CoV-2 consists of four structural proteins including spike (S) glycoprotein, envelope (E) protein, membrane (M) protein, and nucleocapsid (N) protein. Host cell binding and entry are mediated by the S protein. The S1 subunit of the S protein can mediate entry into human respiratory epithelial cells by interacting with cell surface receptors like angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Entry also requires S protein priming by cellular proteases like Type II transmembrane serine protease (TMPRSS2), resulting in S protein cleavage and fusion of viral and airway cellular membranes [5] . Patients with infected airway epithelium can present with a range of symptoms including fever, cough, and shortness of breath, often culminating in acute lung injury, acute respiratory distress syndrome, pulmonary failure, and even death [6] . As of April 04, 2021, more than 30 million cases of COVID-19 have been reported with over 1.6% mortality rate in the U.S. alone [7] . According to WHO's International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP), 8,936 projects including 5,126 interventional studies are registered related to COVID-19 across the globe (searched on April 04, 2021) [8] . With the possible exception of dexamethasone and anti-inflammatory therapy, the currently available medications have questionable and limited efficacy against improving outcomes after COVID- 19 . The WHO SOLIDARITY trial (an international clinical trial to seek an effective treatment for COVID- 19) results have shown that remdesivir (FDA approved drug for COVID-19 treatment) has little or no efficacy on mortality rate in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 [9] . Therefore, there is an urgent need to further identify novel medical therapies both for preventive and therapeutic use. Drug repurposing could significantly curtail the time and cost of development compared to de novo drug discovery, as toxicity and safety data are often available All rights reserved.

A meta-analysis using differentially expressed genes (DEGs) obtained from RNA-Seq studies has the potential to advance our understanding of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis and facilitates the process of anti-COVID-19 drug repurposing. This current study systematically and quantitatively combined analysis of multiple RNA-Seq studies using a meta-analysis approach. This helps decrease the inconsistency in individual studies by increasing the sample size and statistical power to enlist more robust SARS-CoV-2-associated genes [12] . Furthermore, existing, approved drugs with opposing effects on these SARS-CoV-2-associated genes could have the potential to reverse COVID-19 symptoms. Therefore, we employed an in silico approach to discover potential anti-COVID-19 drug targets and suggest a priority for repurposing drugs which are FDA approved or under clinical trial investigation as potential COVID-19 therapies. Finally, this work provides insights into the untested but potential gene targets in relation to COVID-19 pathogenesis.",

Our IPA analysis showed that activation of cytokines IL6, IL16, CXCL1, CXCL3, CXCL5, CXCL6, CXCL8, CXCL10, and CCL20 are a hallmark signature of cytokine response in COVID-19 patients [17, 18] . We also found increased levels of key pro-apoptotic factors like BCL2A1, LTF, SOX6, SPP1, and SYNE1. Li et al. has recently detected apoptosis in bronchial and lung epithelial cells during the initial exudative phase (day 2-4 post infection) of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humanized ACE2 transgenic mice [19] . These proapoptotic factors could represent key nodes associated with epithelial cell death and subsequent diffuse alveolar damage (a critical feature of acute lung injury). Further, canonical pathway analysis suggested an enriched 'IL17 signaling' pathway. IL17 family cytokine levels are associated with respiratory viral infections [20] . It regulates key inflammatory cytokines like CSF3, TNF\u03b1, IL6, IL-1\u03b2, CXCL10, IL-8, MIP2A, MMPs that control granulopoiesis and recruitment of neutrophils, fever, chemoattraction, and tissue damage and remodeling [21] .",

As a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPAR\u03b1) agonist, fenofibrate may also prevents phospholipid accumulation within SARS-CoV-2 infected cells, blocking viral replication [32] . It may also suppress microvascular inflammation and apoptosis through inhibition of nuclear factor-\u03baB and activation of adenosine monophosphate (AMP)activated protein kinase [33] , suggesting the fenofibrate may further have favorable systemic anti-inflammatory and endothelial effects.",

CXCL10 appears to be a particular strong candidate based on high target scores and the availability of two existing drugs inhibiting the action of this cytokine. Our study has several limitations. This investigation is based on in vitro RNA-Seq data, resulting in an under-appreciation of significant inter-cellular signaling that may occur differently in the human body. Furthermore, our computational approach is limited as a tool for evaluating drugs to be repurposed because most available computational tools are used for small molecule drugs only. However, given the pressing need for effective targeted therapies for the treatment of COVID-19, further studies are crucially needed to experimentally validate these results and, if promising, rapidly transition to clinical trials.

Eldelumab and Fenofibrate may be assessed for their effects in modulating COVID-19-related lung pathology. Discussion Despite the growing understanding of the mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 pathology, interventions for treatment of COVID-19 are limited. Most importantly, the identity of critical targets in infected cells that can be modulated in the early/middle stage of disease are not well known. Such interventions could blunt the development of more severe symptoms, hospitalization and death. In the current study, we performed a quantitative meta-analysis of three independent RNA-Seq studies to identify SARS-CoV-2-triggered genes in the transcriptome of human respiratory epithelial cells. Data mining and subsequent extension of bioinformatics analysis of RNA-Seq data revealed 283 DEGs, 15 of which are the target of 48 existing drugs, which could be repurposed for the treatment of COVID-19.
