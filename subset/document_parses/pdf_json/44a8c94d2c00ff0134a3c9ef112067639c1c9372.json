Estimating the overall health effects of this is difficult as most disease surveillance systems have also been substantially affected during the pandemic. For some diseases, this effect is mitigated by the methods enacted to fight the pandemic, such as use of facial coverings, social distancing and quarantine, but measles is infectious to the degree that this mitigation is likely to be limited. Thus, outbreaks and an increase in global measles mortality are expected. However, the severity of this impact is not yet known.",

Our study investigates the magnitude of the increase in measles mortality due to decreased vaccine coverage because of COVID-19, based on official estimates of 2020 measles vaccine coverage from WHO/UNICEF released in July 2021. Using the Lives Saved Tool (LiST), an interventions modeling program, we estimated measles mortality for low/middle income countries (LMICs) based on the 2020 WHO/UNICEF estimates of national immunization coverage (WUENIC). Because these calculations use actual reported vaccine coverage, they provide a more accurate picture of measles mortality related to COVID-19 disruptions in 2020.",

Vaccination, and particularly measles vaccine, is one of the most effective and cost-effective childhood survival interventions. Improved measles vaccination coverage has saved an estimated over 25 million lives since 2000 (Patel, 2020) , and any erosion of vaccine coverage can rapidly lead to outbreaks and large numbers of childhood deaths. Using 2020 WUENIC data, which reflected the tremendous efforts of vaccination programs to sustain measles coverage, we found that estimates of excess measles mortality were lower than predicted early on in the pandemic.

Compared to the estimated deaths generated by the Roberton study, overall deaths using the WUENIC data were 74.3% lower than even the Roberton best-case scenario. This suggests that, while still existent, increased measles mortality due to secondary effects of the pandemic was lower than expected. Data released by UNICEF and WHO (Unicef, & WHO, 2021) indicate that while vaccine coverage did decrease by up to 60% in some regions in the first 6 months of 2020, there was a major recovery effort in the latter half of the year across all regions that appears to have been effective in mitigating the initial drop. Countries in Southeast Asia and the Eastern Mediterranean were most affected by the vaccination decreases, as were the lower income countries which suffered a disproportionate drop in coverage compared to higher income countries. It is important to remember, however, that even a relatively small drop in coverage corresponds to over 3 million more children unvaccinated against measles (UNICEF, & WHO, 2021).",

In Pakistan, measles vaccine coverage per WUENIC estimates actually increased by two points in 2020, leading to an estimated 300 fewer deaths than even pre-COVID-19 modeling would have predicted. One reason why the estimated additional measles deaths are lower than predicted is that vaccine-coverage reduction in Sub-Saharan Africa was minimal in 2020. Many nations in that region are historically major contributors to global measles mortality, whereas many of the nations that contributed most to the estimated additional deaths in this study were in areas with high coverage disruption, such as South and Southeast Asia, which traditionally have a smaller percentage of total measles deaths (Patel, 2020) .",

WUENIC estimates are created by compiling coverage reported by each nation, and then adjusting that data in order to incorporate other data sources like recent coverage surveys and vaccine stockouts (Pan American Health Organization, 2020). However, in the year 2020, due to disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, only 160 countries submitted reports, compared to 195 in 2019. (WHO, & UNICEF, 2021a) . In addition, the accuracy of the data in many countries depends heavily on periodic coverage surveys to confirm or adjust administrative coverage. The further out current estimates are from survey data the more uncertainty exists, and WUENIC estimates are frequently carried forward from one year to another in the absence of additional recent data, a situation exacerbated by the pandemic when coverage surveys were also disrupted. In addition, survey data relies to a variable degree on caregiver recall of vaccine receipt which can be another source of uncertainty and bias for the estimates. Some subjective decisions need to be also made in the process of generating WUENIC estimates (Kowalski, 2012) At the same time that the 2020 WUENIC estimates were released, another group led by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) released modeled estimates of measles vaccine coverage based on administrative and mobility data and a measure of vaccine coverage disruption (Causey, 2021) . This group estimated that MCV1 coverage had declined by 7.9% from 2019, much higher than the estimated 2% decrease apparent in the WUENIC estimates. This is equivalent to almost 3 times as many children missing out on measles vaccination due to the COVID-19 pandemic than the WUENIC estimate (8.9 million versus 3 million). This projection used data for vaccine coverage disruption that primarily came from the first half of 2020 and may not therefore fully reflect the recovery of vaccination in the second half of the year, therefore overestimating the total annual decrease in MCV1 coverage. However if the true coverage were closer to these estimates, the numbers of estimated measles deaths would likely be significantly higher than those in our study. Because the paper by Causey and colleagues only provides estimated changes in coverage by region rather than country, it is not impossible to use the LiST tool to directly compare expected deaths from these estimates to those from WUENIC data.",

            "text": "While many nations saw increased mortality due to measles in 2020, this increase appears to be less than predicted at the beginning of the pandemic, due in part to the strong recovery efforts of public health workers in LMICs in the latter half of 2020. However, coverage and change in coverage varied vastly between countries during 2020 and preliminary data suggests this trend is likely to continue in 2021. Long-term improvements in measles immunization likely provide some level of immunity against short lapses in coverage, but will not stand up in the face of prolonged disruptions, particularly given ongoing disruption to supplementary immunization activities traditionally used in many countries to fill immunity gaps among children missed by routine immunization services. Low mortality numbers should not falsely reassure policy makers into not prioritizing immunization recovery efforts as they are likely to be transitory in the absence of robust catch-up activities.",
