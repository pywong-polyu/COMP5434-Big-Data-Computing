It is unknown whether infection with COVID-19 should factor in to surgical eligibility decision because these patients can develop severe acute respiratory distress syndrome, acute kidney injury, and, if mechanically ventilated, can have high rates of poor outcome. During the peak of the pandemic in New York, our institution saw a significant increase in the number of emergent large vessel occlusions (ELVOs). 1 Here, we report a case series of COVID-19-positive ELVO patients admitted for MCE monitoring.",

A positive result on nasopharyngeal swab utilizing real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was used for diagnosing COVID-19. All patients had a computed tomography (CT) angiogram that confirmed an ELVO in the internal carotid artery or middle cerebral artery. Patients were considered at risk for MCE if they had >50% of middle cerebral artery involvement on CT imaging. Data on demographics, brain imaging, laboratory results, and hospital course were abstracted. All patients were followed until death, discharge from the hospital, or the data cutoff date, whichever came first. Good outcome on discharge was defined as awake, alert, and able to participate in rehabilitation. This study was approved by our institutional review board; written informed consent was waived.

All patients included in this report were admitted over a span of 8 days. Our experience shows that COVID-19 patients with large territorial infarction can have a good outcome after DHC. This is particularly true in patients presenting with minimal respiratory involvement or other extracranial organ injury. While we have limited follow-up data for survivors and neurological recovery, it is reasonable to expect similar neurological outcomes as shown in prior DHC trials. [2] [3] [4] Clinicians should be mindful of increased risk for early rapid herniation due to both permissive hypercapnia and hypoxia-induced cerebral vasodilation, particularly among patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome. An early prophylactic DHC strategy in otherwise surgically eligible patients may be appropriate due to the lack of a reliable neurological exam with sedatives and paralytic usage.",

The frequency of systemic complications in critically ill patients with COVID-19 and stroke is unclear but appears to be high. In our cohort, we saw very early mortality in patients who ordinarily would be considered as medically unstable for DHC, and we also saw systemic complications several days into the ICU course after the typical window of malignant cerebral swelling. It would be difficult to base DHC eligibility on otherwise medically stable patients as it is currently unknown which patient will go on to develop COVID-19-related systemic complications later in the hospital course. Therefore, we suggest that the decision to offer DHC or not should be individualized using the same selection criteria as the pre-COVID-19 era. ",
