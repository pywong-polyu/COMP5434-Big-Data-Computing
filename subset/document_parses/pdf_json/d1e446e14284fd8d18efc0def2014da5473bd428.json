It acknowledges the need for more research on real-life experiences of sex tourism workers but argues that we need to differentiate between sex as a tourism product and as a motivation for travel. First, we need to acknowledge there is a difference between sex tourism as a niche form of tourism, and sex as a potential part of tourist consumption and their behaviour 3 . Considering social distancing measures, border closures and imposed self-isolation, travelling for a very specific purpose to engage in a sexual act is highly unlikely. The 'test, treat and isolate' strategic approach already implemented in a number of countries is a general measure to prevent the spread of coronavirus among the community and help local authorities to deal with the pandemic. The access to an approved vaccine can potentially encourage the revival of international travel and tourism but not specifically to prioritise a distinctive niche of tourist activity such as sex tourism. Further research is needed to",

It is inevitable that sex will again comprise a major part of tourist activity, but the current situation implies that significant changes need to take place to manage and control its promotion and resurgence, particularly in the countries in the developing world.",

A discussion on sex tourism, impacts of COVID-19 and the post-pandemic realities of sex as a tourism product is welcomed and needed, given the non-existence of sex tourism at the moment 2 and unclear post-pandemic perspectives for its development. Although I agree with the authors that further research is needed to study the real-life experiences of COVID-19 on those within the sex tourism industry, we first need to focus more on the nature, context and realities of sex tourism in order to understand and anticipate the inevitable changes in the post-pandemic era.",
