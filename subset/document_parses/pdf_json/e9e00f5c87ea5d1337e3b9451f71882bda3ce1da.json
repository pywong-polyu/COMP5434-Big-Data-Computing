            "text": "Until the recent launch of immunization against SARS-Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV2), control measures for the current pandemic have relied on non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPI). Isolation of cases and quarantine of contact persons are measures focusing on individuals or households. Given the parameters of SARS-CoV2, such as fraction of asymptomatic cases and transmission before the onset of symptoms, isolation and quarantine are of limited efficacy and can quickly become even more inefficient if not carried out as fast and as comprehensively as possible [1] [2] [3] [4] . Therefore, utmost effort is needed to increase the efficacy of isolation and quarantine. The former depends on the public health strategy and available resources for testing, the latter on the power of the local health departments. Household quarantine (Hh-Q) in general and Hh-Q of second degree contacts (Hh-Q2\u00b0) as a NPI tool in particular is not consistently used in the current pandemic. So far, the Robert Koch-Institute (RKI) as national centre for disease control in Germany, recommends putting first degree contacts or close direct contacts (1\u00b0contacts) into quarantine. Exposure of the other household members by 1\u00b0contacts, however, continues across the entire period of the quarantine of the 1\u00b0contacts at home, once the 1\u00b0contact starts shedding and transmitting, whether becoming symptomatic or not. Thus, the risk of not breaking the chain of transmission by only putting 1\u00b0contacts into quarantine instead of the entire household is obvious. In our county health department (CHD), Hh-Q2\u00b0 has been used since the onset of this pandemic.",

In the CHD Ploen, each PCR-confirmed case receives a consecutive case number. Cases #1 to #353 were investigated based on the referring in-house database and the source documents at the time of contact tracing including information on household members. The duration of quarantine during this time period was 14 days according to the guidelines of the Robert Koch-Institute (RKI) (www. rki. de). A quarantine of entire households can be ordered, if a case, finally confirmed by PCR, is diagnosed in a given household. These household members by definition would be 1\u00b0contacts, i.e., close direct contacts. By definition of the RKI, a close contact would be for more than 15 min duration and less than 1.5 m distance without personnel protective equipment (PPE). Since a discussion concerning aerosols came up later and was only integrated into the contact definition as of October 19, 2020, it is omitted here. The intensity of a 1\u00b0contact can be close (contact person type 1) or not as close (contact type 2) or under PPE (contact type 3). Often the primary case, most often also the index case, has 1\u00b0contacts outside of his own household (e.g., at work). The household members besides the 1\u00b0contact(s) of a non-case household would be so-called 2\u00b0contacts, who by definition only had indirect contact to the primary case via the household member who was a 1\u00b0contact. In case the household members cannot separate themselves from the close contact within 72 h (60-96 h) of first exposure to the index case or separate at the time the close contact is tested negative, the entire household can incubate the virus so that tertiary cases might occur beyond the secondary cases in 1\u00b0contacts. Transmission from the 1\u00b0contact can well start within the so-called prepatency period, the time window of viral shedding before onset of symptoms (i.e., before the end of the incubation period) [5] . Beyond this, the 1\u00b0contact may or may not become symptomatic. Figure 1 explains the time windows and the fraction infected in the prepatency period especially adjusted to SARS-CoV2. The time windows are specific for a given virus. The index case in most constellations would also be the primary case of a chain of infection. A secondary case would, for instance, be a 1\u00b0contact person who becomes positive with or without symptoms. A tertiary case would be a contact person of the 1\u00b0contact, e.g., a household member of the 1\u00b0contact. Rarely, an index case could be a latter degree case such as a secondary or tertiary case and thus drawing attention to the primary case by backward contact tracing. For pragmatic reasons, we call a 2\u00b0contact person becoming positive or symptomatic a tertiary case even when the 1\u00b0contact would remain asymptomatic. In analogy to Brockmann and Helbing [8] , their wave model on international spread of pathogens via airports can be used to explain the contact chain and classify exposure of 1\u00b0 and 2\u00b0.",

End of November 2020, Ploen county had a cumulative incidence in the second wave of around 130 per 100.000 and the city of Kiel of 330 per 100.000. There are surely several reasons contributing to this difference which cannot be further addressed here than just to mention that Hh-Q2\u00b0 is not used in the CHD Kiel. The first wave started in our region at the beginning of March, 2020. As of 9 March and enhanced at 23 March, lockdown measures were implemented and maintained until the first week of June, 2020. Already on 17 March, the epidemic curve had started to flatten. During the summer, more and more restrictions were lifted and even big events were allowed. In August and September, travel-associated issues were on the forefront until the first week of October, when the second wave set in. As of 2 November, a 'lockdown light' was implemented until 16 December when another strict lockdown was ordered.",

How many persons to be put into quarantine depends obviously upon several factors such as contact pattern, intensity of contact, time axis, strategy towards direct and indirect contacts, societal structure, i.e., fraction of single household and household size, and particularly on the precision of the work of a CHD. The indication for Hh-Q2\u00b0 was triggered by a delay of notification of the CHD by at least 72 h (60-96 h). This is twice the range of the minimum latency period of SARS-CoV2 Table 2 Efficacy (\u03b5) of isolation and quarantine given a fraction (F) asymptomatic (missed cases) and a fraction \u03b8 of transmissions before symptom onset (1) ( 2) R 0 = basic reproductive number for SARS-CoV2 \u03b5 = efficacy of isolation and quarantine (\u03b5 I + \u03b5 T ); (3) \u03b5 > 1 -1/R 0 according to Fraser et al.

[1] (5) gap = \u03b5 \u2212 \u03b5 max , the difference between \u03b5 needed according to \u03b5 > 1 -1/R 0 (column 3) and \u03b5 max , given a certain fraction of asymptomatic or missed cases; in case the gap is % + , this means a buffer of allowed insufficiency before \u03b5 > 1 -1/R 0 is reached (6) to (10) \u03b5 eff resulting out of F(asymptomatic) in the general population + \u03b8 the fraction infected before the onset of symptoms; gap = \u03b5 \u2212 \u03b5 eff Percentages are rounded up to the next whole number (Fig. 1) [2, 7, 12] . Obviously this time window would need more modelling based on a larger sample size, but according to our practical experience, it seems to work. PCR testing at decision points in contact tracing and for separation within households is of great value. The fraction of single households in our cohort was 29.8% (111 out of 372) and mirrors the societal structure with fewer families and children in general. With 2.1 (1\u00b0contacts only) and 2.9 (1\u00b0 and 2\u00b0contacts) persons per primary case put into quarantine, this should be an acceptable burden for society and is much less than that modelled by Aleta et al. [15] and Hinch et al. [16] or in the other CHDs in our region.",

The early seeding of chains of infection can be prevented by Hh-Q and makes the virus to run into a dead-end. Hh-Q2\u00b0 on a comprehensive scale is the preferable option in contrast to a lockdown of the general population. With Hh-Q2\u00b0, a lockdown might be prevented or at least significantly delayed as also assumed by Aleta et al. [15] . To further justify Hh-Q2\u00b0, investigations within backward contact tracing must be as accurate and as rapid as possible to tailor the quarantine orders, including Hh-Q2\u00b0, only to the fraction of the contact pattern in which exposure is most likely. Again this depends upon the quality and efficiency of the work of the CHD. In spite of using Hh-Q2\u00b0 as a tool in the CHD Ploen, the ratio of cases to quarantine orders was lower than in other CHDs in the region. The ultimate goal is to raise \u025b in spite of the counterproductive viral characteristics (Fig. 1) . The manifestation index is subject to the virus-host interaction; the ascertainment of cases in the population in general depends upon the degree of testing; but the management of quarantine and the use of Hh-Q2\u00b0 are under the authority of the CHD.",

If the household is not stratified in time, the incubation of the entire household or setting continues in case the contact 1\u00b0 starts to shed and evolves into a case. The latter can only partially be identified in time, given the key parameters of SARS-CoV2 such as \u03b8 including the fraction asymptomatic but infectious subjects.",

Once the virus entered a family, the death toll was significant. The virus enters into families via one family member (a 1\u00b0contact) having had an efficacious contact outside.

The main argument, however, remains the public health intervention and blocking the chain of transmission. The conversion of the 1\u00b0contact into a case with shedding at least 2 days before symptom onset or as an asymptomatic spreader is the cornerstone of the argument for Hh-Q2\u00b0. According to our observations, about one in 10 tertiary cases occurs without symptoms in the close contact of that household.",

The most recent data of Zhang et al. [19] makes this effort appear even more inefficient since they pointed out that even with tight testing of household members in quarantine, many are missed as their serological data revealed. Furthermore, the numbers in quarantine increase rapidly in a pandemic wave and the manpower bound by active surveillance accumulates accordingly.

The tool of Hh-Q2\u00b0 is easy to order and logical at the same time. It is astonishing that it was widely overlooked and not identified, at least by authorities, as a straightforward measure within the tool box of NPI. So far it has only been addressed by modellers [15, 16] . Across the entire sessions concerning SARS-CoV2 and COVID-19 during the ESCAIDE conference on 26 and 27 November 2020 organised by the ECDC, it was only mentioned on one slide within the keynote lecture by George Gao, head of the Centre for Disease Control China, in regard to lessons learned in China [20] . As demonstrated within the study presented here, Hh-Q2\u00b0 is also feasible in Western countries. Interestingly the concept of ring vaccination in the endgame of the smallpox eradication campaign was based on the same principle-in this case vaccination of the household members of 1\u00b0contact persons of a case (Adam Finn, 39th Annual Conference of the European Paediatric Infectious Diseases Society). We advocate giving Hh-Q2\u00b0 a higher priority within the tool box of NPI, at least for the control of SARS-CoV2, as already reported by Aleta et al. [15] . Whether it is more widely used than made public, remains an open issue. If explained to persons to be put under Hh-Q, it is widely accepted and plausible. Hh-Q2\u00b0 is to a greater extent not yet addressed in national guidelines since it is a field approach and is easily overlooked by national authorities. The RKI should urgently integrate the approach demonstrated here into their national guidelines. The tool of Hh-Q2\u00b0 is both logical and straightforward.",

This would mean that the impact of household quarantine was underestimated in this study by at least 20%. The eligibility for Hh-Q2\u00b0 might have been selective, but is a standard option in our department. Finally, the base for the case definition could be limited by false-positive PCR tests.
