Keeping in mind that after seventeen months from the announcement of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, various pharmacological treatments were evaluated in this area from the early days up until now. As time passed, some of them were dismissed while several are still clinically used [24] . Many factors are considered in the management of COVID-19 among SOT recipients. Among these factors include the unknown role of immunomodulator drugs such as corticosteroids and interleukin-6 antagonists in COVID-19 treatment. Another factor worth exploring is the pharmaceutical phenomenon of both the COVID-19 and transplantation aspect, including polypharmacy in SOT recipients along with potential drug-drug interactions of the immunosuppressive medications with other therapeutic agents used in COVID-19 management, such as anti-viral drugs. These dilemmas encouraged us to evaluate and review the clinical outcomes of administrating different anti-viral and immunomodulatory drugs in hospitalized transplant patients in one of the largest transplant centers in Asia and the world.",

During the COVID-19 pandemic period, many protocols were applied to control the rate of infection, such as reducing the number of admissions, reducing the number of surgeries and reducing the number of transplants compared to the same as last year, which these protocols have been mention in our previous report [25] . This study was approved by the ethics committee of Shiraz University of Medical Sciences (Ethical Code: IR.SUMS.REC.1399.398). The study timeline was during a period from March 2020 to May 2021 in which all transplant recipients diagnosed with COVID-19 were enrolled based on SARS-CoV-2 positive real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) with hospitalization for more than 48 h. Demographic information of the patients along with the course of disease and array of signs and symptoms, medical history, clinical and radiographic findings, length of hospital stay (both in the ICU and ward), clinical outcome, and management of all patients were extracted from the medical records of the patients and evaluated accordingly. The patient's severity was based on the WHO criteria for the clinical management of COVID-19 [26] . Also, the patient's admission was based on the joint discretion of an infectious specialist and transplant surgeon, for patients with moderate, or higher severity of the disease. RT-PCR assays were performed according to the protocol established by the WHO and previous studies. Each patient's nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab samples were obtained and analyzed for SARS-CoV-2. The RNAs were extracted using the QIAamp \u2122 viral RNA micro kit from Qiagen \u2122 according to the manufacturer's instructions in a biosafety cabinet and in accordance with laboratory biosafety requirements. With E-gene and Rdrp-gene probe/primer and superscript \u2122 III platinum, one-step qRT-PCR kit of Invitrogen company mixtures was prepared. The mixtures were transferred to Roche Light cycler \u2122 96 and Applied Biosystem ABI step one plus \u2122 real time thermal cyclers with positive control and no template control (NTC) as well as an internal control [25, [27] [28] [29] [30] .",

The interactions between post-transplant-related medications with anti-viral drugs have made it more difficult to use the drugs commonly used in COVID-19 management. Moreover, clinical data In the early era of the COVID-19 pandemic, Lopinavir/Ritonavir was used to be prescribed commonly in patients infected with COVID-19, based on the results suggesting efficacy against another coronavirus. In our study, Lopinavir/Ritonavir not only increased the mortality rates but also notably prolonged the length of ICU stays, in which patients who took Lopinavir/Ritonavir stayed in ICU for 5.3 more days on average. Many studies reported similar results, discouraging the use of Lopinavir/Ritonavir in the transplant population. Circumventing the use of this drug is attributed to its adverse effects and interaction with immunosuppressants such as Tacrolimus and other medications used in the transplant population, such as fluoroquinolones to deal with Gram-negative infections. Furthermore, gastrointestinal upset (e.g., nausea and vomiting) is the most common adverse effect of this drug along with QT prolongation in combination with other drugs used in the COVID-19 treatment regimen. Moreover, a rise in liver enzymes was also reported in some cases. Concerning the reported effects, routine administration of Lopinavir/ Ritonavir in transplant patients was discouraged. After being approved by WHO in October 2020, Remdesivir use has been increased dramatically and multiple studies were published indicating its role in managing COVID-19 patients in the world, while there were also some studies reporting contrary efficacy results. Overall, there hasn't been a conclusive study based on Remdesivir use in SOT COVID-19 patients up until now, while only some small or case-report studies on its efficacy in these patients have been published so far. For example, in a study by Duran et al., it has been suggested that early Remdesivir use in orthotopic heart transplant patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 would improve clinical outcomes in the patients. Our study confirmed that a 5-day regimen of Remdesivir will significantly decrease the mortality rates in transplant patients. Since this drug has no potential interactions with other immunosuppressive medications used in SOT patients' drug regimens, it seems that Remdesivir could be a promising anti-viral drug in managing transplanted COVID-19 patients. However, to establish a more precise conclusion, the results of larger multicenter studies with greater sample sizes should be analyzed. On the other hand, there is a concern about nephrotoxicity and elevation of hepatic enzymes occurrences after receiving Remdesivir, which is critical in decision making for liver or kidney transplant recipients. In a multi-center cohort study, it was reported that Remdesivir administration did not significantly increase the incidence of acute kidney injury, even in patients with GFRs lower than 30 mL/min. Additionally, in the \"SIMPLE-Moderate trial\" study (NCT04292730), a clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a 5 or 10-day regimen of Remdesivir versus standard care, it was reported that hepatic enzyme elevation in the Remdesivir-receiving group was not higher than the control group. Our results suggest that a decrease in GFR or hepatic enzyme elevation is not significantly different between transplant patients who were treated with Remdesivir and patients treated with other anti-viral drugs. Similar results have also been reported in other studies performed on transplant patients. In conclusion, it seems that Remdesivir could be considered a promising antiviral with appropriate efficacy and safety in transplant patients infected with SARS-CoV-2.",

Zhu et al. also believed that appropriate doses of IV corticosteroids during a short period will not only protect the allograft from acute rejection, but also decrease the alveolar exudation and improve systemic symptoms due to its anti-inflammatory effects. On the other hand, several studies discouraged widespread use of corticosteroid medications, and even advised to discontinue or reduce the dose of steroids in transplant patients. They adduced to the potential negative effect of early corticosteroids administration in reducing pathogen clearance, while increasing viral shedding subsequent to immune response inhibition. Observational studies showed that corticosteroid treatment was linked to higher mortality rates and nosocomial infections for influenza and delayed virus clearance for SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV); however, there is limited data regarding SARS-CoV-2 [40] .

Further, published results of several clinical trials regarding the evaluation of the efficacy of Tocilizumab, such as the COVINTOC study, showed that the combination of the drug with standard care has achieved higher success in decreasing the risks of requiring mechanical ventilation or death, compared to the combination of a placebo and standard care. The subjects were hospitalized due to COVID-19 pneumonia and did not receive mechanical ventilation when enrolled in the study. However, the TOCIVID study showed no difference between the two groups in the total risk of death by any cause [46] .",

The risk of complication occurrences after drug administration was not higher than other therapy groups. The most probable reason behind diverse results between these studies is the basic differences in studies design; in which some studies were case reports, while some had a more extensive pool of patients. On the other hand, some of the studies, in the process of analyzing mortality rates among the groups who had not been treated with Remdesivir or Tocilizumab, have matched the patients based on critical mortality risk factors such as age, transplant type, and immunosuppressive regimen, while several considered this factor in their clinical trial. Also, there are differences in the onset of Tocilizumab administration and its enrolling requirements. In some studies, Tocilizumab was combined with high doses of corticosteroids and the drug administration had been started prior to intubation, while in some studies, the therapy had been started after patient intubation. Also, while some studies restricted mortality rates to its occurrence during hospitalization, several had followed up on the patients the mortality rates for 30 days after dismissing dates [47] .",

Due to this, it seems that designing a clinical trial to analyze the results related to the administration of anti-viral and immunomodulator drugs in transplant patients is critical. Our study only includes the results during the hospitalization period, and the patients haven't been followed up after being discharged. For example, 28-day mortality and long-term complications were not evaluated. Another limitation was that there was no control group including the non-transplant infected patients. Therefore, the unique features of the transplant patient in terms of clinical symptoms, response to medications, and potential adverse effects of drugs could not be measured. In this study, the primary goal was to study the clinical aspects of COVID-19 patients, and due to the limited resources and equipment of developing countries, molecular evaluation was very limited. We also didn't evaluate more detailed virological features, such as characteristics of the viral genotype, the amount of the virus at the time of infection, and the change in the amount of the virus after treatment. Also, one of the factors influencing the reduction of mortality throughout the study timeline has been the more experienced medical staff in the field of management of patients with COVID-19, but it is somewhat difficult to assess the effect of this factor alone. Finally, in our study, some patients received multiple agents, and therefore the impact of each agent is difficult to tease out.",
