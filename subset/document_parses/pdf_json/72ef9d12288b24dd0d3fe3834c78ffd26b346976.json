The disease was first recorded in the United States in the early 1930s [2] . Since then, outbreaks of IB in layer and broiler flocks have been reported globally with considerable economic losses due to poor growth performances in broilers, and egg production and quality defects in layers [3] . Although vaccine-mediated control measures are extensively employed, IB is still a major issue in the poultry industry in Canada and globally [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] .",

IBV/Ck/Can/17-038913 isolate clustered within the GI-13 lineage along with IBVs isolated from different parts around the world that are known as 793B type (also known as 4/91 and CR88; Figure 1 ). The complete genome of IBV/Ck/Can/17-038913 isolate consists of 27,472 nucleotides, excluding the poly (A) tail. Twelve ORFs (5 -1a-1b-S-3a-3b-E-M-4b-4c-5a-5b-N-3 ) were predicted (Table 1) . Sequence comparison analysis demonstrated that the genomic nucleotide identity between IBV/Ck/Can/17-038913 isolate and different IBV strains ranged from 86.1% (TW2575/98) to 92.0% (JMK) while it showed 87.2% identity with turkey coronavirus (TCoV) isolate (TCoV/IN-517/94). Among the different ORFs of the genome, the S gene was the most variable (70.9-96.7%), whereas it showed only 48.3% identity with TCoV (TCoV/IN-517/94). On the other hand, the 5b accessory protein was the most conserved (91.6-98.4%). IBV/Ck/Can/17-038913 isolate revealed higher sequence identities (93. .0%) of the 3b, E, M, 4b, 4c, 5a and 5b ORFs with the Canadian Massachusetts (Mass) type isolate (IBV_SES_15SK-02). The 3a and N had the highest nucleotide identity with the Conn46 1996 strain at 94.8% and 96.7%, respectively. ORF 1a had the highest nucleotide identity (93.5%) with TCoV/IN-517/94. The IBVs of 793B type, 4/91 vaccine, ck/CH/LSD/110857 and IBVUkr27-11, showed the highest identity (95.1-96.7%) with the S gene (Table 2) . Phylogenetic trees constructed based on different genomic regions showed different topologies and confirmed the results of the sequence comparison. The IBV/Ck/Can/17-038913 isolate did not cluster with 793B type strains outside of the S1 gene, whereas it clustered with the Mass type (1a and E genes) or Mass and non-Mass type strains (1b, M and N genes; Figure 2 ).

The mean IBV genome loads in 100 ng of extracted RNA from OP swabs (a), CL swabs (b) at 3, 6, 10 dpi and from various tissues of infected hens at 6 dpi (c) and 10 dpi (d) are shown here. The IBV genome loads in swabs and tissues were compared using the Kruskal-Wallis test followed by Dunn's multiple comparison. The error bars represent the SD.

First, based on S1 gene phylogenetic analysis, our IBV/Ck/Can/17-038913 isolate grouped within the GI-13 lineage along with 793B IBVs (also known as 4/91 and CR88). Second, the IBV/Ck/Can/17-038913 isolate leads to subclinical infection in laying hens with no impact on egg production. Third, the IBV genome load data suggest that IBV/Ck/Can/17-038913 isolate has a very broad tissue tropism.

Additionally, another Mass type isolate, IBV-SES-15SK-02, shared high nucleotide sequence identities with our isolate in genes 4 and 5 and most of gene 3. The role of Mass type strains in the evolution of our isolate was further elucidated by identifying IBV-SES-15SK-02 isolate as a minor parent for a recombinant region in the 3 end of the genome. Over the last two decades, a marked proportion of the IBVs detected in the Canadian poultry operations has shown to be of Mass type [4, 37] . Despite the high similarity of different genomic fragments with Mass type strains, another recombination event occurred during the origin and evolution of the IBV/Ck/Can/17-038913 isolate and caused it to cluster with the 793/B group. Within the S gene, natural recombination events associated with shifts in the serotype and/or genotype of the circulating IBVs were described in the past [39, 41] .",

However, the IBV/Ck/Can/17-038913 isolate led to histological changes in the kidney with significant recruitment of T cell subsets and macrophages.
