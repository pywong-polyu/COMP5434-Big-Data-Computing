For the technical feasibility, monthly water demand per family was compared with the amount of water collected in the rainy and dry seasons. In addition, 16 physical, chemical, and microbiological parameters were evaluated at the inlet and outlet of the water system. e economic feasibility was determined by the initial investment and maintenance of the systems; with the benefits, we obtained the net present social value (NPSV), social internal rate of return (SIRR), and cost-effectiveness (CE). Technically, oxygenation and chlorination in the storage tanks allowed for water quality in physical, chemical, and microbiological aspects, according to the D.S. N\u00b0031-2010-SA standard, in all cases. Finally, with an initial investment of S/2,600 and S/70.00 for annual maintenance of the system, it is possible to supply up to six people per family with an average daily consumption of 32.5 L per person. It is suggested that the system be used at scale in the context of native communities in north-eastern Peru.",

However, around the world, people die from lack of quality water, especially in rural areas (native and peasant communities) [3] . For instance, Urakusa native community in the Amazonas region (NW Peru) has no basic sanitation services (water supply for drinking and domestic use) and relies on communal silos and latrines for disposal of human waste [4] . In Amazonas, unfortunately, the province of Condorcanqui has the highest percentage of lack of both services (92.3%) [5] . e lack of basic services in rural areas (such as water), together with economic and climatic factors, directly influence chronic child malnutrition and anaemia [6] . e provision of safe drinking water for rural communities must, therefore, be a public priority. However, public projects are unsustainable due to dispersed housing, requiring costly distribution networks [7] . In this situation, rainwater harvesting, storage, and utilisation systems are of paramount importance for those populations that still do not have access to water or have shortages [8] .",

However, there are studies that demonstrate the feasibility of these systems. For example, in Ireland, they focused on treating rainwater to address water depletion due to massive population growth [11, 12] . In Spain, a feasible predictive model was developed for rainwater harvesting in rural communities [13] . In Sydney, average annual water savings are related to annual rainfall and a positive cost/benefit ratio of rainwater storage tanks [14] . In Latin America, because of conditions from northern Chile, Peru, and parts of Ecuador, rainwater harvesting is also feasible [15] . Rainwater storage depends on the size of the tanks and the area, for which technical and economic considerations must be taken into account when choosing the type of storage system [8] .",

Population growth, forest burning, and industrial expansion cause chemical modification of rainwater [17] . In that sense, rainwater harvesting and treatment is what determines its use, depending on its ability to eliminate enterobacteria, viruses, protozoan cysts, and bacterial spores that can cause disease [18] . Global health depends not only on the quantity of water supplied but also on the water quality; a quarter of the world's population suffers from water-related illnesses [19] . In Urakusa, rainwater quality is poorly prioritised because of the lack of sanitation services [4] . In this sense, rainwater may be used to avoid the use of water from springs and streams, in order to preserve them as they are threatened and highly polluted by human activities [19, 20] . Rainwater treatment has only sense if it is done properly; therefore, the most widely used disinfection method (as part of the treatment) is chlorination due to its easy accessibility and application, as well as its high oxidant capacity expressed in the reduction of organic matter [21] . e cost-effectiveness of rainwater harvesting systems needs to be assessed in order to determine the systems' effectiveness at the user level. e economic analysis allows determining the feasibility of production from rainwater [22, 23] . Water is one of the most important and scarce commodities available to people worldwide, and Peru is no exception in this respect. Many populations are forced to drink from sources whose quality is outside the regulations (D.S. N\u00b0031-2010-SA) leading to health risks for children and adults [24] . In rural Peru, people lack access to safe drinking water; in fact, only 20.0% of the population have access to this service through the public water network [25] . One of the goals of the development objectives (SDGs) is to achieve universal access to safe drinking water, sanitation, and hygiene [26] , and Peru is a party to these agreements.",

Water deficit was observed in almost all months (Table 2) ; generally, these negative values are associated with water use in laundry and showering (in months where the lag is negative, water use should be prioritised). For water supply, each month water use should be prioritised, and larger sheds should be installed to capture more water. e 1,100 L storage systems tank was sufficient to supply all of the families' needs for a week, assuming no rain. However, if they only prioritise water for food consumption, it can supply up to 15 days. It was determined that during the rainy months, storage tanks with a maximum capacity of 460 L are needed; therefore, the chosen tanks are the 1,100 L tanks; this is justified because the rains are constant, and there are days when even for the FI-S3 system; only a 15.00 L container is needed to supply water to the family.",

With respect to total solids, Gonz\u00e1lez [54] found parameters between 79 ppm and 94 ppm; for this reason, continuous maintenance of the systems is recommended to reduce the TDS 22.20 mg/L, in the FPK-S2 system. ese high and discontinuous values are observed due to the lack of cleanliness of the roof. is dynamic is typical of indigenous communities.

Alkalinity values ranged from 11.13 to 36.57 mg/L CaCO 3 , and all values were very low and acceptable. According to the literature [55, 56] , alkalinity is a very important parameter for drinking water, as it buffers rapid pH changes. e physicochemical results for the low-water season are shown in Table 5 , where zinc problems are evident for the FI-S3 and FT-S4 family system, not meeting the standard (D.S.

In the community of Kigkis, in the Nieva district, water from the distribution network showed aluminium (0.527) and iron (0.482) above acceptable limits [57] . Moreover, in the Chiangos community, in the Nieva district, high values of aluminium (0.2062) were found. Aluminium in all systems ranged from minimum and maximum values of 0.2-0.67 mg Al/L, respectively. e problems of heavy metals persist for both periods; technical and economical measures such as oxygenation of the storage tanks should be taken to achieve precipitation of both aluminium and zinc. is is left as a proposal: recommended, with at least maintenance every two months. It is an easy method of operation for the users and will bring benefits such as the removal of inorganic (including aluminium that could be present as a precipitate) and organic particles and reduction of turbidity [58] . Table 6 shows the results for microbiological parameters in the rainy season, which were above the water quality regulation (>1,600 NMP/100 mL). In many parts of the world, rainwater does not meet quality standards, and this is attributed to the frequent presence of faecal contamination, mainly from animal origin [59, 60] .

When water is not chlorinated, microorganisms may be present in the water [65] , as evidenced during the rainy season. With the operation and maintenance of rainwater harvesting systems, the quality of water for human consumption is guaranteed [66] . However, it is recommended that rainwater be chlorinated [67] . Chlorination of stored water reduces the risk of diarrhoea [68] . erefore, rainwater harvesting systems can improve the quality of life of the inhabitants. In Australia, samples collected from 10 tanks contained E. coli in concentrations that exceeded the limit of 150 MPN/100 mL for recreational water quality [69] .

As such, access to water has become a management problem to improve the quality of life in rural areas, due to high costs [19] . e lack of water has caused great famines and has led to the mobilisation of entire villages in search of solutions [81] . Native communities are no exception to these social conflicts (access to basic services such as water) [5] .",

It is important to mention that, currently, these costs are covered by the population in the time spent carrying the water. Consequently, they are unable to perform their normal activities (social, family, economic, educational, etc.). Water access, like money, is a fundamental need of any population and is an essential condition for many people to have a better life [82] . Table 12 shows the investment costs over the 5-year evaluation horizon. For the implementation of the rainwater harvesting and treatment system, 89 families were estimated with an annual investment cost of S/2,600.00 per family. e investment in the fifth year would be S/231,400. is evaluation horizon will allow competent bodies to determine the amount of investment in rainwater in order to satisfy the human right to water, without necessarily achieving an economic benefit [82] . In this sense, a cost-effectiveness analysis was useful to value costs that could not be presented in terms of monetary values [83] . Table 13 shows the cost flow over the evaluation horizon, both with and without project. With 10% of the total haulage costs incurred by the inhabitants of the locality (Tunants and Yahuhua), the water supply problem could be solved. is would allow them to cover their needs for human consumption and domestic use water. Socio-economic factors of the population would have positive readjustments, such as ",
