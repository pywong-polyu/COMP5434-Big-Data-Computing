These plumbing-related microorganisms can pose a serious public health risk. Several previous studies have reported Legionella contamination in hotel water distribution systems. For example, a study conducted in Greece reported that 20.8% of the water distribution systems in 385 Greek hotels were positive for Legionella spp. [6] . Another study from Southwestern Greece reported the presence of Legionella in 36% of water distribution systems in hotels [7] . Two other studies conducted in Italy observed percentages of Legionella contamination ranging from 63.6% [8] to 75% [5] in 11 and 40 Italian hotels, respectively. These studies considered culture-based methods for Legionella detection. When PCR-based methods were used, 74% of 19 Italian hotels showed positive results for Legionella contamination in their water, and the authors of this study demonstrated that culture-based methods could underestimate the contaminations [9] . A recent study of 2020 investigated the prevalence of Legionella contamination and its molecular diversity in 168 hotels and resorts across Israel [10] and found that out of 2830 samples tested, 470 (17%) obtained from 102 different premises (60% of hotels) were positive for Legionella spp. The most frequently contaminated water sources in this study were cooling towers (38%), followed by faucets, hot tubs, water lines, and storage tanks (14-17% each) .",

The DPH developed the Georgia Legionellosis control and investigation manual, which is used for investing an outbreak. Moreover, the DPH states that the health authority should provide the facility with educational material about the prevention of Legionella for tourist accommodations, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Water Management Program Toolkit [19] . The facility should implement a water management plan to prevent Legionella, per CDC recommendations. If the facility had a WMP in place, they should review the plan and revise it as needed [19] . However, many hotel owners, managers, and employees are not aware of what precautions to take if their hotel water system is compromised.

Each facility must develop a WMP that is tailored to that specific building. Key hotel personnel who are responsible for implantation must consider (1) understanding the building's plumbing system, (2) identifying all areas of the plumbing endpoints, (3) ensuring all water equipment and fixtures are maintained and kept in a good state, (4) developing teams that are responsible for reducing stagnation of water, biofilm and mold buildup at water fixtures, (5) creating a maintenance log for all cleanings, checks, and services, and (6) developing an emergency plan in case of a water emergency, such as a boil water advisory or do not drink advisory. In addition, hotel personnel should pay attention to water temperature levels because Legionella spp. grows well in warm water, and many previous outbreaks were associated with hot water systems [26, 27] .",

Overall, the results of this study have determined that the vast majority of hotel personnel are not aware of water management plans. As the surveys stated, many hotel facilities would implement a WMP if they knew more about it. This study shows that if awareness for the program is provided, it is more likely for the facility to implement the program. As we enter a world forever transformed by the current pandemic, health and safety programs will no longer be an afterthought. For example, new guidelines to help to slow the spread of COVID-19 will be in place for the foreseeable future as awareness of the severity of the disease has risen. Hence, the same can be done simultaneously for waterborne illnesses in hotels and tourist facilities. We believe this study, along with many others mentioned above, will serve as a guideline to show how our hotels and other service industries can win the trust of Georgians and other American people that their health is safe.",

The study concludes that if hotel personnel believe that they are susceptible to an outbreak, they will be more likely to implement a WMP. This solidifies the need for research to continue to ensure the health of our larger communities. It was encouraging to see that many of the participants who were not aware of WMPs became interested in learning more about the program during the time of recruitment of this study. If there is no push for further research and raising awareness, people will continue to be susceptible to another waterborne outbreak while they may be vacationing with loved ones, at a conference, or other circumstances that involve hotel stays.
