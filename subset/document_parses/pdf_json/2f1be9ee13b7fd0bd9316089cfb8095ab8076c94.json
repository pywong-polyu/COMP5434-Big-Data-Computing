Several COVID-19 vaccines have been approved for emergency use in humans and are being used in many countries. However, all of the approved vaccines are administered by intramuscular injection and this may not prevent upper airway infection or viral transmission. Here, we describe intranasal immunization of a COVID-19 vaccine delivered by a novel platform, the helper-dependent adenoviral (HD-Ad) vector. Since HD-Ad vectors are devoid of adenoviral coding sequences, they have a superior safety profile and a large cloning capacity for transgenes. The vaccine (HD-Ad_RBD) codes for the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and intranasal immunization induced robust mucosal and systemic immunity. Moreover, intranasal immunization of K18-hACE2 mice with HD-Ad_RBD using a prime-boost regimen, resulted in complete protection of the upper respiratory tract against SARS-CoV-2 infection. As such, intranasal immunization based on the HD-Ad vector promises to provide a powerful platform for constructing highly effective vaccines targeting SARS-CoV-2 and its emerging variants.",

The development of safe and effective vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 is a global health priority and a number of vaccine platforms have already been tested 2 . These include inactivated virus 3, 4 , naked DNA delivered by electroporation 5 , mRNA delivered by lipid nanoparticles [6] [7] [8] [9] , viral vectors such as nonreplicating adenovirus 10-17 , replication-competent vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) 18 With the roll out of approved vaccines in many countries, several limitations of the firstgeneration of COVID-19 vaccines became increasingly apparent. The requirement of ultra-cold temperature for transportation and storage of the mRNA vaccines is a major limitation especially for global distribution in developing countries. In addition, all the approved vaccines are delivered by intramuscular injections, which may not be able to prevent the infection at the upper respiratory tract and stop viral shredding and transmission 26 .",

This characteristic minimizes the host immune response to the vector and allows for long-term expression of the transgene in host tissues or organs [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] . In addition, HD-Ad does not integrate into the host genome, thereby eliminating the risk of introducing chromosomal mutations. Besides its excellent safety profile, HD-Ad has a high cloning capacity (up to 36 kb) for transgenes, which makes it possible to deliver large genes or multiple genes. All these features make HD-Ad an attractive platform for vaccine construction and delivery. In this study, we delivered the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (S protein) to mice intranasally using an HD-Ad vector and examined its immunogenicity and protective efficacy.",

Using the primers that are specific to the sequence of the SARS-CoV-2 E gene, we detected very high levels of viral RNA (10 8 to 10 9 copies/mg) in the lungs of mice vaccinated with the HD-Ad vector control. In contrast, the viral RNA levels were reduced by >4 log10 in 16 out of 17 mice vaccinated with HD-Ad_RBD (Fig. 3C) .",

            "text": "they have typically not provided effective protection against viral infection in the upper airway of animals or humans. The ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine, developed by the University of Oxford,and AstraZeneca, is based on a replication-incompetent chimpanzee adenovirus15 . This vaccine was tested in rhesus macaques in a prime-boost regimen (4 weeks apart), at a dose of 2.5\u00b410 10 viral particles administered intramuscularly. The animals developed moderate neutralizing antibody titers (reciprocal ID50 GMT:10-160, after the boost) and were mostly protected from lung disease. However, the viral replication in the upper respiratory tract was not controlled 15 .The mRNA-1273 vaccine developed by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and Moderna was tested at two doses (10 \u00b5g and 100 \u00b5g) in rhesus macaques in a prime-boost regimen with a 4week-interval by intramuscular injection 7 . For the high dose case, the vaccine induced high levels of IgG and neutralizing antibody, reaching a reciprocal GMT of 36,386 and a reciprocal ID50 GMT of 1,862, respectively, after the boost vaccination. Moreover, the animals were almost completely protected from SARS-CoV-2 infection in the lower respiratory tract (BALs).However, even in the high-dose group, viral RNA was detected in the upper respiratory tract(nasal swabs) in three out of eight macaques on day 1 post-infection and one out of eight on day 4 post-infection 7 . A similar finding was observed when the mRNA-1273 vaccine was tested in mice 38 . The BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine developed by BioNTech and Pfizer was also tested in rhesus macaques at two doses (30 \u00b5g and 100 \u00b5g) in a prime-boost regimen by intramuscular injection 39 . High levels of neutralizing antibody (reciprocal ID50 GMT: 1,689) were detected in the high-dose group after boost vaccination. These animals were completely protected against SARS-CoV-2 infection in BALs. However, viral RNA was detected in high levels in nasal swabs of five out of six vaccinated animals at day 1 post-infection, and in oropharyngeal swabs of three out of six vaccinated animals at day 1 post-infection, and in two out of six vaccinated animals at day 3 post-infection 39 . Our HD-Ad_RBD vaccine confers a complete protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection in the upper air way of the hACE2 mice, as evidenced by the absence of viral RNA almost immediately after the intranasal infection with SARS-CoV-2 (day 1 post-infection). We also did not detect any infectious virus in the lungs at day 1 post-infection. These results show a rapid control of viral replication almost immediately after viral infection. Taken together, our data suggest that HD-Ad_RBD has the potential to control infection at the site of inoculation, which should not only prevent virus-induced disease but also transmission. The superior protection efficacy of our HD-Ad_RBD vaccine is likely due to high antigen expression levels and the intranasal delivery route employed. Replication-deficient adenoviral vectors with one or more early genes deleted (the first-and second-generation Ad vectors) are among the most efficient vehicles for in vivo gene delivery and they have been used for the development of COVID-19 vaccines. However, one of the major limitations in the use of these vectors for therapeutic purposes is the transient nature of the transgene expression and the systemic toxicity, which are both due to inflammatory and immune responses triggered by the residual expression of viral proteins 40-42 . To overcome these problems, HD-Ad, the third generation of Ad vectors, with all viral coding sequences deleted, was used in our study. HD-Ad minimizes the host immune response to the vector and allows long-term expression of the transgene in host tissues or organs, thereby providing a safer and more efficient way for gene delivery and transgene expression 30-34 . Consistently, we detected high level expression of the RBD in transfected cells and the majority of the protein was secreted, which ensures efficient antigen-dependent stimulation of the host immune system. Consequently, the HD-Ad_RBD vaccine induced extremely high levels of antigen-specific antibody response. For example, the IgG reciprocal GMT in sera reached 1,837,920 even though we used a moderate dose of the vaccine (5\u00b410 9 viral particles) for vaccination. We also detected high levels of neutralizing antibody against the SARS-CoV-2 virus, and the reciprocal ID50 GMT was close to 1,000, which is in the same range of the neutralizing antibody induced by the two mRNA vaccines (mRNA-1273, BNT162b2) described above. The superior safety profile of HD-Ad allows us to deliver the vaccine by an intranasal route. Compared to intramuscular injection, immunization through the nasopharyngeal route has the advantage of eliciting a local immune response, including secretory IgA antibodies that confer protection at or near the site of infection of respiratory pathogens 43 . Consistently, high levels of antigen-specific IgA were detected in both sera and BALs of the animals vaccinated with HD-Ad_RBD, indicating that this vaccine induced robust mucosal immunity, in addition to strong systemic immunity. To our knowledge, there has been only one published study evaluating the intranasal delivery of a COVID-19 vaccine candidate. Hassan et al. compared intramuscular injection and intranasal delivery of a chimpanzee Ad-based (simian Ad-36) SARS-CoV-2 vaccine in mice 12 . They found that intranasal delivery, but not intramuscular injection, of the vaccine induced the production of IgA in BALs and the sera of the animals. In K18-hACE2 mice, a single intranasal delivery of the vaccine (10 10 viral particles) followed by challenge with SARS-CoV-2 resulted in very low levels of viral RNA in the nasal turbinates or washes, suggesting almost complete protection of the upper respiratory tract against infection 12 . One caveat of this experiment is that they used a lower dose of SARS-CoV-2 (10 3 foci forming units) to challenge the single intranasal vaccinated hACE2 mice, as compared to the 4\u00b410 5 FFUs used for other experiments in their studies 12 .",

ELISA Purified RBD protein was used to coat the flat-bottom 96-well plates (Thermo Scientific NUNC-MaxiSorp) at a concentration of 1 \u03bcg/ml in 50 mM carbonate coating buffer (pH 9.6) at 4 \u00b0C overnight. The following day, plates were blocked with solution containing 1% BSA in PBST. Serially diluted mouse sera or BALF were added and incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 1 h. Antibodies including goat anti-mouse IgG horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated (31430 thermo) and anti-mouse IgA HRP-conjugated (626720 Invitrogen) were diluted 1:5000, or 1:200 in blocking solution. After incubation for 1 h, the plates were washed and developed with 3,3',5,5'tetramethylbiphenyldiamine (TMB, 34028, Thermo) for 10 min. The reactions were stopped with 1.0 M H2SO4 stop solution. The absorbance was measured on a microplate reader at 450 nm (A450). The endpoints of serum or BALF dilutions were calculated with curve fit analysis of optical density values for serially diluted serum or BALF with a cut-off value set to two to three times the background signal.",
