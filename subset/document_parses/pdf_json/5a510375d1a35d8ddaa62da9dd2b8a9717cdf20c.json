            "text": "Much uncertainty persists about how the coronavirus (COVID-19) and its derived crisis effects will impact both the economy and forests. Here we conceptualize a recursive model where an initial COVID-19 supply-side shock hits first the Global North that, mediated by country-specific epidemic management strategies and other (fiscal, monetary, trade) policy responses feeds through to financial markets and the real economy. Analytically we distinguish two stylized scenarios: an optimistic V-shaped recovery where effective policy responses render most economic damages transitory, versus a pessimistic pathway of economic depression, where short-run pandemic impacts are dwarfed by the subsequent economic breakdown. Economic impacts are transitioned from the global North to the South through trade, tourism, remittances and investment/capital flows. As for impacts on tropical forests, we compare the effects of past economic crises to early indicators for incipient trends. We find national income and commodity price effects to be torn between three forces: a contractive-inflationary supply-side shock, deflationary pandemic demand-side effects, and expansive-inflationary monetary and fiscal policy responses. We discuss how global forest outcomes will depend on how these macroeconomic battles are resolved, but also on geographical differences in deforestation dynamics. Reviewing recent fire and deforestation alerts data, as well as annual tree-cover loss data, we find that deforestation-curbing and -enhancing factors so far just about neutralized each other. Yet, country impacts vary greatly. Changing macroeconomic scenarios, such as fading out of huge economic stimulus packages, could change the picture significantly, in line with what our model predicts.",

Fig. 1 describes the systemic blocks, which we will explain in this subsection, and then use them as an organizing thread throughout this article. We have developed a graphical, recursive ('top-to-bottom') model. Recursiveness means that if we get our macroeconomic predictions wrong, forest impacts will also need revisions; the reverse is not true, except for some caveats on longer-term forest-to-economy feedback loops (cf. Section 7).",

Through social distancing measures, the spread of the disease can be mitigated (flattening the curve), thus sparing human lives and delaying infection rates, yet also exacerbating short-term production shortfalls. Jointly, the two effects trigger a reduced availability of labor, as well as restrictions in the mobility of people, goods and services. This will curb production of certain goods and services, especially those that are labor-and/or transport-intensive. Although not our focus, we flag also some direct impacts on land use and forests in the North. We term these effects the COVID-19 supply shock.",

In addition, consumers will likely become more cautious, spending generally less for precautionary reasons, in the face of considerable uncertainties. Hence, a demand contraction effect will occur. Yet, government macroeconomic policy responses will be a moderating factor. During previous crises in this millennium, central banks lowered interest rates and injected additional liquidity into the economic system. Financial markets (Section 3.2.) are important in terms of mediating credit and wealth effects vis-\u00e0-vis the real economy: when economic agents come to lose faith in the economy's capacity to cope with a crisis, contracting credit and falling asset values can lead to systemic chain reactions such as defaults, runs on banks, and a deflationary spiral. The prevailing social mood will manifest itself strongly in the financial markets.",

When the epidemic becomes a pandemic, thus affecting practically all trading partners that take similar restrictive steps, this will particularly hit products with complex global supply chains (e.g. the automobile industry). Commodity prices will influence the flows of imports and exports of goods, as will quantitative restrictions imposed by the coronavirus crisis (e.g. ships unable to deliver their merchandise to a port). In addition, tourism is a service sector earning large foreign exchange inflows into many Southern economies. Remittances from workers abroad are another such non-commodity flow of income, and some North-South return migration may occur. Foreign direct investments and North-South capital flows more broadly will also be affected.",

Naturally, these changes in private demand and in public policies will affect Southern land use and forests, in terms of deforestation and forest degradation (Section 6).

Another pandemic strategy has been to screen, test, trace, and quarantine (STTQ) (Mulligan et al., 2020) . Modelling of pandemic outcomes flagged STTQ action early on as the single most rewarding strategy component (isee systems, 2020). Early, rigorous STTQ adopters (e.g. South Korea, Taiwan, New Zealand) managed well the pandemic tradeoff with lockdown costs, compared to countries that relied heavily on LSSD (e.g. Italy, Spain) (Wangping et al., 2020) . Nevertheless, rigorous STTQ encroached strongly on individual freedom.

India and Brazil rank second and third globally in absolute number of COVID-19 cases, but this reflects their large populations: they rank much lower according to the density of cases (#108, #36) and deaths (#110, #13). No developing country enters the top-ten of both density lists; no country from Sub-Saharan Africa enters the top-50 ranking (Worldometers, 2020) . 2 As a caveat, COVID-19 cases and deaths are likely underestimated more in low-income countries with poor registries. Globally, 3.55 million COVID-1 A North-South dichotomy is always simplified, by implicitly referring more to economic development level and capacity than geography (e.g. Australia, New Zealand, or Singapore in the Southern Hemisphere), and through large heterogeneity within \"the South\". Still, Southern countries have less capacity to implement economic stimulus policies counteracting COVID-19 effects. Notably China is 'Northern' in our model, being a main source of global commodity demand. 19 deaths were official by end-May 2021 (Worldometers, 2020) ; a modelled range estimate of excess (otherwise inexplicable) deaths suggests instead 7.1-12.7 million lives lost (The Economist, 2021) .",

Fig. 2 depicts expected market supply-and demand-side effects from epidemic/pandemic cases, using a traditional supply-demand diagram determining aggregate production and price levels. 3 From the pre-COVID-19 equilibrium (point A), the pandemic shock pushes the supply curve upwards from S 0 to S 1 : at any given price, less is produced. With demand given by curve D 0 , the new intersection point B marks lower production and higher prices: across markets, the supply shock is inflationary. However, with reduced national production and income, demand would subsequently also be curbed (new curve D 1 ). This further depresses output (point C), while this partial price impact is deflationary: lower demand makes goods and services cheaper. Finally, governments and central banks may launch monetary and fiscal stimulus packages to boost confidence, liquidity, and demand. This would mitigate the demand slack, bringing it back to the intermediate curve D 2 . This partial effect will be expansionary on production, and inflationary on prices, with a new equilibrium at point D.",

Second, by definition, a macroeconomic crisis will lower supply, demand, and incomes: counteracting stimulus policies should not trigger an outright net expansion in output. Still, we can analytically distinguish between two stylized scenarios. A pessimistic 1930s-style \"lasting economic depression\" would entail mass bankruptcies, unemployment, and an enduring global economic downturna scenario that finds support in some long-cycle theories of capitalist development (see Section 3.2). Conversely, under an optimistic \"Vshaped recovery\", asset values, employment, and income growth would speedily and fully recover to pre-COVID-19 levels. While one of us is ex ante more inclined towards a pessimistic scenario (Wunder, 2020) , we deliberately consider both stylized options here, recognizing that greyscales between them are most likely to play out.",

The upward price trend is being linked to climate change impacts on supplies, through wildfires and largescale bark beetle attacks (Meyer, 2021 ). Yet, demand effects have dominated short-run fluctuations: less construction traditionally reduces demand for, and diminishes prices of timber, as seen in the USA (Prestemon et al., 2018) , China (Zhang et al., 2015) and Japan (Hansen and Luppold, 1992) . With this backdrop, US lumber prices were spectacularly halved during March 2020, as construction slumped with COVID-19 lockdowns. But markets not only recovered with government stimulus; they also boomed with demand from homeowners adapting their home offices and urban dwellers fleeing dense cities into the suburbs. Simultaneously, US sawmills were affected by shutdown-induced labor shortages, causing inflationary supply-shock effects (McClellan, 2020) . From the March 2020 low to April 2021, lumber prices thus skyrocketed sevenfold, being labeled \"the hottest commodity on the planet\" (Meyer, 2021) . As we write, lumber prices have pulled back by 25% during one single month (see Section 4). Also noteworthy is that sawn log prices, i.e. prices paid to producers for their raw timber, have lagged far behind this spectacular boom, indicating that supply-side shortages at the retail end, combined with speculative forces, have driven the lumber boom, and probably sawmill windfall profits, into current excesses (McClellan, 2020) .",

Expansion of agricultural commodities has been a key driver of tropical deforestation, especially the so-called 'big four': cattle, oil palm, soy, and wood products (Pendrill et al., 2019; Nolte et al., 2017) . World-market commodity prices are thus key incentives for land-and forest-use changes. However, direct drivers differ across deforestation frontiers; for instance, subsistence agriculture remains dominant in Africa. In this millennium, smallholder cash crops have gained deforestation momentum (Pacheco et al., 2021) . The influence of commercial agriculture has been rising since 2013, with two thirds of land cleared illegally, though the share of domestic markets has expanded most rapidly (Dummet et al., 2021) . Fig. 5 contextualizes recent global market-price development (indexed January 2016 = 100) for eight agricultural commodities of our particular interest: six that directly compete for land use with tropical forests, and two key staple crops (wheat and rice) for comparison.

For instance, numerous meat-processing factories in Europe and the US had to close due to high worker infection rates, thus affecting prices and availability of output. Analysis of trade data shows the US supply shortfall stimulated Brazilian beef exports to grow by 50%; 12% of such frozen beef imports came from Amazon slaughterhouses in high-deforestation risk zones (Zu Ermgassen, 2021). Conversely, export markets for certain perishable (e.g. flowers 5 ) and/or highly labor-demanding commodities (e.g. vegetables) suffered profound supply-side and trade disruptions. In some cases, COVID-19 thus induced more commodity trade from the tropics, in others less. Fig. 6 shows various non-agricultural commodity prices of tropical relevance. We have already commented on the timber hyper-boom, and more modest price recovery for pulp & paper. Gold prices recorded a persistent upward trend since 2016 (+69%), little affected by the COVID-19 commodity bust; gold mining has over the last decades become a key driver for forest loss (Alvarez-Berr\u00edos and Aide, 2015). Finally, petroleum prices collapsed under the transport freeze and general demand slack: US oil futures prices famously declined from US$54 into deep negative territory in late April, but recuperated 2019 levels in early 2021.",

The S&P GSCI 6 index, consisting of 24 weighted commodities, serves us as benchmark (Fig. 6) .

First, some spatial-contextual variables are known to effectively protect forests: high, inaccessible, wet, steeply sloped lands, with poor soils. Obviously, these site-specific, fixed characteristics offer little leverage for change in a pandemic setting. We would be more interested in deforestation drivers that were to change during adjustment to an economic crisis. Say, the presence of indigenous peoples and low population density both correlate with low deforestation; hence a government-financed program resettling landless farmers into indigenous territories would be expected to fuel deforestationand the crisisdriven loss of government funds leading this program to be abandoned would de facto become an (unintentional) forest-protective crisis effect.",

Beside the longer-lasting credit crunch and debt crisis in the 1980s and early 1990s, the global financial crisis of 2008 was a more recent, shorter-lasting event. Yet, it had only moderate impacts in the Global South, in large part because the Chinese economy proved robust in its recovery and commodity demand. Asia faced a financial crisis of its own in 1998/99 that had more regional flash-crash features of shorter duration. Finally, various commodity prices slumped jointly during 2014-16, which affected exporting developing countries.",

            "text": "Declining trade volumes would likely dominate here (unless exchange rate devaluation effects are large and sustained), reducing incentives to deforest new areas; conversely, unemployment from lost incomes may also generate pressures towards increased subsistence farming (Section 6.3). 2. Less private investment: If investors perceive the crisis to be mostly temporary, land grabbing and commodity investments would remain robust; e.g. after the 2008 financial crisis, deforestation did not slow down much. Still, fewer new mining projects in forests seem to occur, with less finance and reduced incentives to extract lower-priced minerals (Butler, 2015) . 3. Rising poverty and changing consumption patterns: Rising poverty was flagged as an unambiguous deforestation-reducing factor in Busch and Ferretti-Gallon (2017), through reduced national economic activity in forested countries. In case-study reality, still many internally opposed factors are at play. Consumer savings-led cutbacks on protein-rich meat and dairy products (e.g. in Latin America) will reduce deforestation; the shift to more consumption of firewood and tuber subsistence crops (e.g. in Central Africa) may increase forest pressures (Wunder, 2003) . Most deforested lands in Latin America end as pastures (e.g. Kaimowitz et al., 2004) . Beef has high income elasticity, so its use will decline when incomes fall (Gallet, 2010) , especially at the low-income end (Zhao et al., 2020) . Expanding and changing domestic food consumption has been an underestimated deforestation trigger in recent years (Castro, 2020) . Even small changes in larger-scale populations' income can thus matter for domestic market-induced deforestation pressures (Alix-Garcia et al., 2013) . 4. Less government spending (employment, subsidies, etc.) : How this affects forests depends on how public budgets were spent before the crisis. If governments used to subsidize fuel costs, agricultural production, and resettlement of people into forested areas, then cutting these costs will come to protect forests (Wunder, 2003) . 5. Less government investment in new infrastructure: Road construction through forests may be the single most important global deforestation driver (Laurance et al., 2014) . Capital investments such as roads across the Global South are particularly crisis-sensitive (Carranza et al., 2011; Beuran et al., 2015) , and it is harder to borrow externally for these projects. A few key road projects, abandoned due to COVID-19, could thus preserve ample forest areas. 6. Deteriorating governance, including environmental protection: Governments have fewer resources (and give lower priority) to environmental enforcement and protected area management. Since both factors were unambiguously forest-protective in meta-studies, their weakening is likely to have environmental costs (Butler, 2015) . 7. Rise of informal/subsistence economy: More informal-sector, subsistence-oriented, and sometimes illegal production (e.g. illicit crops) provide less leverage for conservation market mechanisms (e.g. certification) (Butler, 2015) . Loss of off-farm income reinforces the drive towards subsistence and forest loss (Araujo et al., 2019) . 8. Less rapid urbanization, or outright return migration. Perhaps the strongest argument for crisis-led deforestation occurs if more of the population surplus stays in/returns to land-extensive slash-and-burn agriculture in systems with excessive rural population density (Sunderlin and Pokam, 2002) . On the other hand, urban construction will decline under crisis, likely implying less forest degradation from timber extraction. Massive post-lockdown urban-rural return migration has been seen e.g. within India (minimum 6.3 million train travellers during May-June 2020), Indonesia, Peru and US-Mexico (Saxena et al., 2021) .",

Ultimately, it is thus an empirical question which partial effects are dominating. Butler (2015) juxtaposed for the 2001-13 period three types of commodity prices (energy, agriculture, mineral) to tree-cover loss data from the University of Maryland (Fig. 9) . From 2002 to 2012, commodity prices quintupled in a synchronized manner, but then levelled off and declined. Tree-cover loss followed along, including during the 2008/ 09 crisis, but then reduced already during the levelling-off process. This correlation confirms what the bulk of case studies, and the deforestation meta-study made us suspect: that forest-protecting effects from economic crisis may gain the upper hand through the commodity trade mechanismsthough probably with much variation over space and time.",

This mismatch in timing effectively invalidates any lockdown-attributable explanation. Saavedra (2020) looked closer into this for 70 tropical countries: during January-July, there were some 150,000 more deforestation alerts in 2020 than in 2019, but this divergence started in January, i.e. before the global pandemic. Using country-specific lockdown dates and difference-indifference analysis, he finds generally no statistically significant difference between pre-and post-lockdown deforestation alerts. Still, for some important forest countries (Brazil, Mexico), post-lockdown alerts did rise strongly.",

Still, COVID-19 provided a convenient political excuse to push forward an agribusiness-focused agenda of land expansion.

Still, around 40% of production was used for biodiesel in 2019, which, with the dramatic 2020 bust in petroleum prices, suffered to compete. This also affected coal mining, a recent source of deforestation (Kaimowitz and Wunder, 2021) . Forest product prices, such as for pulp & paper, also suffered initially. Indonesia issued a decree in end-May 2020 to scrap timber licensing requirements, putting into jeopardy its EU Voluntary Partnership Agreement, though partially backtracking since (Jong, 2020) . Overall, the basket of Indonesia's main forest-related and forest-competing commodities thus faced less favorable price trends than Mexico and Brazil.

In the sections above, we have conceptually analyzed the linkages between COVID-19 and emerging forest impacts. Compared to one earlier conceptual effort (Brancalion et al., 2020) , we have analytically laid open a greater complexity and diversity of economically conditioned impacts. In turn, in our recursive structure we have abstracted from feedback loops from deforestation to COVID-19. For instance, forest burning can worsen respiratory impacts of COVID-19. Notably, bushmeat extraction and loss of forest biodiversity have been flagged as drivers of zoonotic infections (Wolfe et al., 2005) , including COVID-19 (United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI), 2020), so that investments in avoiding future deforestation and wildlife trade could pay off for future epidemic prevention (Dobson et al., 2020 ). Yet, not only tropical deforestation, but also booming oil-palm plantations and temperate re-and afforestation may be associated with increased outbreaks of zoonotic and vector-borne diseases since 1990 (Morand and Lajaunie, 2021) . Likewise, greenhouse gas emissions from forest loss contribute to climate change, as a systemic crisis ahead. Hence, some medium-term 'backwards' feedback loops towards our economic/anthropic systems can be quintessential for humanity's resilience.",

Third, government stimulus responses, through expansionary monetary and fiscal policies, would counteract the deflationary demand contraction so as to restore economic confidence. Seeing these textbook crisis effects play out in the COVID-19 reality was not a story without surprises. Only scattered initial inflationary supply-side effects occurred, including in agriculture and forestry in the Global North: the deflationary forces of demand contraction and asset deflation were initially operating much more quickly, as signaled through financial markets. More supply-chain distortions occurred only later, when storage levels and port capacities became compromised. Demand-side contraction in the North overshot, including due to Europe's inability to adopt more cost-effective pandemic strategies.",

In our case studies above, Africa, with its mostly subsistence-led deforestation, was admittedly not well represented. Ultimately, deforestation is about the decisions land stewards are making. Let's assume for a moment I am a poor farmer in a rural forested part of Southern Cameroon. Due to COVID-19 global and national economic impacts, I might lose an off-farm side employment in a timber company, plus remittances from urban relatives, some of whom may return to live with me in the countryside, having lost their urban employment. I could no longer afford to buy rice and would be forced to go back to more slash-and-burn cropping of tubers for my subsistencethe dominating deforestation driver in Cameroon. Hence, I would end up deforesting more than before, like other people who become marginalized from the formal economy.",

However, 80% of my production would be for a national market, where growing \"crisis mode\" would reduce the consumption of meat and dairy products. I might also be worried about price and exchange-rate fluctuations, and the drying up of national credit. Also, the government would be doing a poorer maintenance of roads and ports. My bottom line would likely be to reduce plans to clear more forest.",

Notably, this more conservative bottom line proved radically different from the biased story that was interpreted inadequately into short-run deforestation alert data, and circumstantial evidence that seemed to conveniently support the idea of a large pickup in deforestation. 7 Seemingly, there is a lesson to be learned: that we need to first stay tuned for the next bulletins from the global laboratory of macroeconomic alchemy. Once these new trends are settled, our conceptual framework above can hopefully assist in predicting what next impacts on forests we should expect, and accordingly address.",
