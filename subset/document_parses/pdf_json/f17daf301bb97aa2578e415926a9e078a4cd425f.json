The Golgi apparatus is generally viewed as the transitory station where palmitoyl acyltransferases (PATs) modify PMPs, which are then transported to their ultimate destinations such as plasma membrane (PM); little substrate specificity among the many PATs has been determined. Here we describe inherent partitioning of G\u03b1o\u03b1 -subunit of heterotrimeric Go-proteins -to PM and Golgi, independent from Golgi-to-PM transport. A minimal code within the G\u03b1o N-terminus governs the compartmentalization and re-coding produces G-protein versions with shifted localization.",

Heterotrimeric G proteins are composed of G\u03b1, G\u03b2 and G\u03b3 subunits. The G\u03b1 subunit is loaded with either GDP or GTP; the G\u03b2 and G\u03b3 subunits form a constitutive heterodimer that reversibly binds to G\u03b1. GPCRs directly interact with heterotrimeric G proteins on the cytosolic surface of the membrane. Upon activation, GPCRs act as exchange factors to enhance the release of GDP from G\u03b1, leading to the binding of GTP and activation of the G\u03b1 subunit. Subsequently, activated G\u03b1 dissociates from the receptor and the G\u03b2\u03b3 heterodimer, and the free subunits are competent to interact with downstream targets 2 .",

Recently, however, considerable experimental evidence has accumulated supporting the notion that GPCRs can activate G\u03b1 subunits on the Golgi and other compartments 3 . Analogously, activation of the KDEL receptor (KDELR) by cargo from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) was shown to trigger signal cascades via G\u03b1s and G\u03b1q/11, with KDELR acting as a non-canonical GPCR at the Golgi 4 . Our own work showed that KDELR also binds and activates monomeric G\u03b1o, which in turn enhances the Golgi-to-PM trafficking via small Rab GTPases 5 . Therefore, the subcellular compartmentalization of G\u03b1 subunits appears to be of fundamental relevance for their functions. How G\u03b1 subunit compartmentalization is achieved and controlled, however, remains poorly understood.",

N-myristoylation occurs co-translationally and results in the attachment of a 14-carbon saturated fatty acid (myristate) to the N-terminal Gly via a stable amide bond 7 . S-palmitoylation occurs post-translationally and results in the attachment of a 16-carbon saturated fatty acid (palmitate) to a Cys residue through a reversible thioester linkage 8 . In vertebrates, N-myristoylation is catalyzed by two closely related Nmyristoyltransferases (NMT1 and NMT2) whose substrate specificities have been intensively studied in recent years 9 . Intracellular S-palmitoylation is catalyzed by a zinc-finger Asp-His-His-Cys domain-containing (zDHHC) family of palmitoyl acyltransferases (PATs) 10 . There are up to 24 zDHHCs described in mammals; opposite to NMTs, their substrate specificities are far from being well understood, although substantial advance has been made lately 11 .",

Moreover, our data indicate that the steady-state localization of G\u03b1o at the PM and Golgi apparatus is the outcome of local S-palmitoylation events. These findings contrast the previous view that i) Spalmitoylation of PMPs occurs exclusively at the Golgi and ii) serves to drive subsequent PM-directed delivery of such proteins.

Quantification of average fluorescence intensities at these compartments confirmed a much higher Golgi and a lower PM localization of G\u03b1o-Nt 7 -GFP compared to G\u03b1o-Nt 31 -GFP and G\u03b1o-GFP (Fig. 1e,f) , despite similar expression level of the constructs ( Supplementary   Fig. 1g,h) .

For this aim, we co-expressed the G\u03b1o constructs together with mRFP-G\u03b21 and mRFP-G\u03b33 in N2a cells, and immunoprecipitated the GFP-fusions. Fulllength G\u03b1o-GFP strongly pulled down G\u03b21\u03b33, whereas G\u03b1o-Nt 7 -GFP and G\u03b1o-Nt 31 -GFP showed a very faint co-precipitation of G\u03b2\u03b3 with no apparent difference between them ( Supplementary Fig. 1j) . Thus, the preferential localization of G\u03b1o-Nt 7 -GFP to the Golgi, as opposed to the dual localization of G\u03b1o-Nt 31 -GFP to Golgi and PM, is independent from G\u03b2\u03b3.",

The distinct localization patterns of G\u03b1o-Nt 7 mutants impaired in N-myristoylation and S-palmitoylation were not associated with significant variations in their expression levels ( Supplementary Fig. 1k ,l), and were emulated by the treatment with the specific inhibitors DDD85646 22 and 2-bromopalmitate (2-BrPal) 23 , respectively (Fig. 1m,n) .

The authors did not exclude the possibility that peptides lacking a positive charge at position 7 might also be accepted by NMTs. Thus, N-myristoylation of G\u03b1o and all human N-myristoylated G\u03b1 subunits is not in conflict with the lack of a Lys/Arg residue at position 7 ( Supplementary Fig. 1a,d) . At position 6, a Ser residue is found in G\u03b1o and its homologues, and Ser is by far the most frequent residue at this position among NMT substrates 18 . Thus, we first introduced point mutations at Ser6 in G\u03b1o-Nt 7 based on the substrate recognition motif described by Castrec et al. and on a previous study indicating that Arg, Asn, Phe, and Val can occupy this position as well 24 . Substitution of Ser6 by Ala, Cys, Gly, or Thr showed efficient membrane binding (Fig. 1o ) and expression levels similar to G\u03b1o-Nt 7 ( Supplementary Fig. 1n,o) . Interestingly, the S6C mutant displayed a strongly increased PM localization as compared to the wild-type G\u03b1o-Nt 7 -GFP (Fig. 1o,q) and a migration shift in SDS-polyacrylamide gels ( Supplementary Fig. 1n ), suggesting that Cys3 and Cys6 both undergo S-palmitoylation and that PM targeting might be enhanced by the dual S-palmitoylation. N-myristoylation of these mutants was indirectly verified with the inhibitor DDD85646 (Fig. 1p) . Conversely, we observed a largely cytosolic and nuclear localization for the constructs in which the Ser6 was substituted by Arg, Asn, Phe and Val ( Supplementary Fig. 1p) , suggesting that such amino acid substitutions make the N-terminal peptide of G\u03b1o a poor substrate for MNTs; the expression levels of the mutant constructs did not significantly differ from G\u03b1o-Nt 7 -GFP ( Supplementary Fig. 1n ,o). We conclude that the lipid modifications and subcellular localization of the G\u03b1o-Nt 7 constructs are highly sensitive to even minor changes in this heptapeptide sequence.",

These results imply that MGNC-Nt 7 -GFP preferentially associates with the PM-derived endocytic rather than the Golgi-derived secretory pathway. The distinct localization of MGNC-Nt 7 -GFP was not the result of changed expression or membrane binding, as its level ( Supplementary  Fig. 1k ,l) and presence in the membrane fraction (Fig. 1k,l) were not significantly different from that of G\u03b1o-Nt 7 -GFP.

The first scenario involves a certain degree of promiscuity among PATs 11 , and implies that lipidations and a few surrounding amino acids confer specific binding properties e.g. to lipids, which are known to differentially accumulate all over the endomembrane system 30 . Additionally, fatty acids other than palmitate can also be attached to the available Cys and might confer different binding specificities to the S-acylated protein 31 .

Most of the zDHHCs have four transmembrane domains (TMDs), whereas only two and three members present five and six TMDs, respectively 11 . The majority of zDHHCs localize at Golgi and the remaining are distributed among the ER, PM and endosomes 34, 35 . In order to confirm their subcellular localization, we expressed a collection of twenty-three HA-tagged mouse zDHHCs in N2a cells 36 . As expected, immunostainings revealed that a large number of zDHHCs localized predominantly at Golgi: zDHHC3, 7, 9, 12, 13, 15-17, 21, 23, and 25 ( Supplementary Fig. 3b ). Six showed a clear PM localization but were also found on endosomes: zDHHC2, 5, 11, 14, 18, and to a lesser extent zDHHC8.

To determine if G\u03b1o-Nt 7 and MGNC-Nt 7 are differently lipidated at PM vs. Golgi, we aimed at developing a method to visualize local Spalmitoylation in intact cells. Inspired by the nuclear envelope localization of zDHHC4, we engineered zDHHCs that ectopically target the outer nuclear membrane (ONM) to detect mislocalized substrates. We took advantage of some components of the well-studied LINC family, which in turn are inserted in the inner nuclear membrane 39 . As C-termini of all zDHHCs except zDHHC24 face the cytosol, we hypothesized that addition of a C-terminal KASH-domain might induce their targeting to the ONM (Fig. 4a ). To test this hypothesis, we first generated a zDHHC5 construct carrying N-terminal mRFP for visualization and the KASH-domain of syne-1/nesprin-1 at its C-terminus (mRFP-zDHHC5-KASH). In HeLa cells, the KASH-domain alone (mRFP-KASH) is efficiently targeted to the ONM (Fig. 4b) , and mRFP-zDHHC5 localized at PM and endosomes as expected ( Fig. 4c and Supplementary   Fig. 3b) . Addition of the KASH domain strongly impaired PM localization of zDHHC5 ( Fig.   4d ), but a robust ONM targeting was only achieved by the co-expression of the KASHinteracting protein SUN2 (Fig. 4e ).",

To quantify these effects, we measured the mean GFP-fluorescence intensity at the ONM and nearby cytosol, and used their ratio to determine the relative ONM content of the Nt 7 constructs. Quantification revealed a similar ~2.5-fold accumulation of G\u03b1o-Nt 7 -GFP and MGNC-Nt 7 -GFP at the ONM by co-expression of mRFP-zDHHC11-KASH (Fig. 5e ), suggesting that zDHHC11 equally accepts both Nt 7 constructs as substrate. On the other hand, the KASH-fusions of zDHHC2, 5, 8, 14 and 18 showed no effect on the localization of G\u03b1o-Nt 7 -GFP and MGNC-Nt 7 -GFP in HeLa cells ( Supplementary   Fig. 4d ,e).

We wondered whether these effects could simply result from physical interactions, differential among different zDHHC-substrate pairs. However, we identified that the zDHHCs do not possess high-affinity binding abilities to the Nt 7 sequences, as immunoprecipitation of G\u03b1o-Nt 7 -GFP, MGNC-Nt 7 -GFP, MGSSCSR-Nt 7 -GFP or MGLLCSR-Nt 7 -GFP did not co-precipitate any of the three tested mRFP-zDHHC11/3/7-KASH constructs ( Supplementary Fig. 4f, Supplementary Fig. 5c ,d, Supplementary Fig. 6d) . Thus, the effects we uncovered are more consistent with specific yet transient, enzymatic interactions among PATs and different substrates.",

We employed HeLa instead of the murine N2a cells for this analysis, as siRNAs have been used successfully to downregulate the expression of human zDHHCs in this cell line 47 . We first determined if, in addition to zDHHC5 (Fig. 4c) , zDHHC3, 7 and 11 show localizations in HeLa similar to those in N2a cells ( Supplementary Fig. 3b) . Accordingly, HA-tagged zDHHC3 and 7 were predominantly localized at the Golgi, while zDHHC11 was at the PM ( Supplementary Fig. 9a-c) . Since only minor effects were observed by single siRNA transfections (data not shown), we expressed G\u03b1o-Nt 7 -GFP or MGNC-Nt 7 -GFP in cells pretreated with siRNAs against the pairs of zDHHC3/7 and zDHHC5/11. G\u03b1o-Nt 7 and MGNC-Nt 7 localized normally in HeLa cells transfected with control siRNA, with G\u03b1o-Nt 7 predominantly at the Golgi and MGNC-Nt 7 mainly at the PM (Fig. 8a,d) . Remarkably, the simultaneous depletion of the Golgi-associated zDHHC3 and 7 clearly affected the localization of G\u03b1o-Nt 7 : the construct exhibited a much weaker presence at the Golgi whereas its targeting to the PM appeared enhanced (Fig. 8b) . MGNC-Nt 7 , however, was not affected by this treatment (Fig. 8e ), but its localization was notoriously shifted toward the Golgi in HeLa cells upon the concomitant downregulation of the PM-associated zDHHC5 and 11 (Fig. 8f) . On the other hand, distribution of the G\u03b1o-Nt 7 construct did not show major changes in cells depleted of zDHHC5 and 11 (Fig. 8c ). Quantification showed a significant reduction in the relative Golgi localization of G\u03b1o-Nt 7 by the downregulation of zDHHC3/7, and a significantly increase in the Golgi content of MGNC-Nt 7 upon zDHHC5/11 depletion (Fig. 8g) .",

As expected, G\u03b1o-GFP and mRFP-G\u03b21\u03b33 strongly co-localized at the PM and endomembranes in control HeLa cells (Supplementary Fig. 10e ). When these components of the G protein heterotrimer were expressed together with zDHHC11 in the SwissKASH assay, mRFP-G\u03b21\u03b33 relocalized to the ONM in the pattern identical to G\u03b1o-GFP (Fig. 9g) . We tested next if a downstream signaling molecule might be co-recruited to the ONM by G\u03b1o, and selected RGS19 which preferentially interacts with the active, GTP-loaded G\u03b1o 48 . In addition to G\u03b1o-GFP wild-type, we used the GTPase-deficient mutant of G\u03b1o (Q205L) that is present in the GTP-loaded state in cells. Accordingly, a clear ONM accumulation of a His 6 -tagged RGS19 construct was observed when the SwissKASH system was applied to the Q205L mutant ( Fig.   9h ) but not the wild-type G\u03b1o (Supplementary Fig. 10f) . Altogether, our SwissKASH system shows that local S-palmitoylation of G\u03b1o can cause its in-situ accumulation in the signalingcompetent form, indicating that zDHHC selectivity and subcellular localization are key players in the substrate compartmentalization of the G protein, and potentially PMPs in general.",

More importantly, we developed a system SwissKASH for the rapid detection of zDHHC-substrate pair relations in intact cells, opposing to the disruptive biochemical and proteomic techniques currently used to study S-palmitoylation 38 . Altogether, this work supports a model in which local Spalmitoylation by distinct zDHHCs is crucial for G\u03b1o compartmentalization, and most likely for other PMPs (Fig. 10 ). In this model, N-myristoylation allows the nascent protein to reach virtually the whole endomembrane system. Subsequently, specific PM-and Golgi-localized zDHHCs catalyze S-palmitoylation of PMPs, which in turn accumulate at these compartments. Our model is in agreement with the local S-palmitoylation described for substrates such as PSD-95 at dendritic spines 37 and calnexin at the ER 47 , but adds the Golgi as a compartment in which PMPs can be locally modified and retained. To our knowledge, Spalmitoylation via the large number of Golgi-localized zDHHCs has been exclusively discussed in the context of Golgi-to-PM transport of integral 52 and PMPs 12 . We hereby challenge this notion and show instead that PMP localization to one compartment or another (including Golgi and PM) is not a consequence of sequential trafficking of the PMPs but rather a direct localization driven by the substrate-specific PAT activities at different compartments.",

The extreme C-terminal region of zDHHCs appears unstructured and is most likely not involved in the binding and presentation of substrates 11 , implying that the fusion of a KASH domain does not interfere with substrate specificity. Accordingly, our SwissKASH pointed to zDHHC3, 7, and 11 as the major PATs for G\u03b1o. This result agrees with a previous study showing zDHHC3 and 7 as the main PATs for G\u03b1i2, G\u03b1q and G\u03b1s 57 , while zDHHC11 activity toward G\u03b1 subunits has not been detected. This discrepancy could be explained by a differential turnover rate of PM-and Golgi-localized G\u03b1 subunits. For instance, if the turnover of the PM pool of G\u03b1i2 is much faster than its Golgi pool, the S-palmitoylation of G\u03b1i2 by the PM-localized zDHHC11 might have gone unnoticed by the biochemical methods used in that study. The SwissKASH system might therefore provide an advantage in sensitivity by targeting zDHHCs to the ONM, as even small amounts of a substrate are visible at this ectopic compartment. In agreement with that, we found that in our SwissKASH assay G\u03b1i2 is recruited to the ONM by zDHHC11 as well as G\u03b1o is (data not shown).",

The G\u03b1o-Nt 31 construct containing the basic region within the \u03b1 -helix showed indeed a greater steady-state localization at the PM compared to G\u03b1o-Nt 7 . In the SwissKASH system, the presence of the \u03b1 -helix in G\u03b1o-Nt 31 appears to impact substrate recognition by the Golgi-associated zDHHC3 and 7, but not by the PM-localized zDHHC11. Thus, these data point to a second level of complexity in the substrate affinity by zDHHCs, where regions distant from the palmitoylatable Cys might subserve regulatory functions. How the polybasic region in G\u03b1o impacts the substrate specificity by zDHHCs remains to be clarified.",

Our SwissKASH system could enable screens for molecules that perturb site-and zDHHC-specific S-palmitoylation of pathological proteins. This approach may provide an attractive alternative to directly target the desired oncogene (or protein of another pathogenic activity), focusing instead on developing tools to target the zDHHCs controlling the proper (or pathological) localization of the protein. In this regard, zDHHCs can be targeted by the drug discovery efforts. The large number of these enzymes in humans and their distinct expression patterns provide the reasoning to expect the power of such an approach in obtaining the favorable pharmacodynamics with limited side effects. Another approach might aim at targeting the specific zDHHC-substrate interaction pairs; this avenue is expected to deliver even more specific targeted therapies.",

As a proof of validity of this approach, we recorded >50 cells expressing the GFP constructs under identical confocal settings, finding that the Golgi signal from G\u03b1o-Nt 7 -GFP is ca. 1.5-fold higher, and its PM signal is ca. 2-fold lower, than those of G\u03b1o-Nt 31 -GFP (data not shown), recapitulating the ratio representation we adopted in Fig.   1e ,f and further elsewhere.",

Thus far, three crystal structures of heterotrimeric Go have been solved, showing a prominent \u03b1 -helix in the G\u03b1o N-terminus that extends toward the G\u03b2\u03b3 heterodimer. Overlay of the N-termini of the three structures revealed the \u03b1 -helixes to start at position 6 to 10 and to end at position 31 (Supplementary Fig. 1a-c). Similarly, overlay of Ntermini of seven solved structures of G\u03b1i1 a close G\u03b1o homologue showed the \u03b1 -helix from the residues 7-8 to position 31 (Supplementary Fig. 1d-f). This analysis suggests that the N-termini of G\u03b1o and its homologs contain distinct regions: the unstructured yet harboring lipidations heptapeptide to be followed by the \u03b1 -helix. To study if these regions might have specific roles in G\u03b1o subcellular localization, we generated the following GFP-fusion constructs (Fig. 1a): one including G\u03b1o N-terminal heptapeptide (G\u03b1o-Nt 7 -GFP), another with the first 31 residues covering the \u03b1 -helix (G\u03b1o-Nt 31 -GFP), and a third containing only the \u03b1 helix (G\u03b1o-Nt 8-31 -GFP).

Localization of G\u03b1o-Nt 7 and MGNC-Nt 7 in control cells was not affected during the 45 min of recording (Supplementary Figure 2h,i), whereas both constructs showed progressive changes by Palmostatin B treatment. Particularly, the signal of G\u03b1o-Nt 7 at Golgi diffused over the surrounding area upon time, whereas its PM localization seemed not to be affected(Fig. 2l, Supplementary Fig. 2jand Supplementary Movie 1). Accordingly, quantification revealed that its PM content did not significantly change during the entire recording time(Supplementary Figure 2j), but its co-localization with the MannII-mRFP Golgi marker showed a significant decrease starting at 25 min of treatment(Fig. 2n). The PM signal of MGNC-Nt 7 -GFP presented no major changes during Palmostatin B treatment as well, but its overall presence in the perinuclear region slightly increased in a pattern that did not resemble the Golgi(Fig. 2mand Supplementary Movie 2).

The distinct localization of G\u03b1o-Nt 7 and MGNC-Nt 7 still observed in HeLa cells (Supplementary Fig. 2g) was lost by the FM 4 insertion in both cell lines, and cytosolic aggregates of different sizes were visualized instead. After chemical dissociation by the D/D solubilizer, most of the aggregates vanished and the constructs showed their characteristic localizations (Fig. 3a,b for HeLa, data not shown for N2a cells). Then, live imaging was performed in HeLa cells co-expressing either Nt 7 -FM 4 -GFP construct together with MannII-mRFP as Golgi marker. As expected, G\u03b1o-Nt 7 -FM 4 -GFP showed a rapid accumulation at the Golgi once the D/D solubilizer was added (Fig. 3c,e and Supplementary Movie 3). On the other hand, MGNC-Nt 7 -FM 4 -GFP presented a rather slow and miniscule accumulation at the Golgi, as opposed to the rapid PM targeting of the construct (Fig. 3d,e and Supplementary Movie 4).

All PCR products were cut with KpnI/NotI and then used to exchange the corresponding GFP sequence from pEGFP-N1. For Drosophila expression, the plasmids containing the constructs G\u03b1o-Nt 7 -GFP, MGNC-Nt 7 -GFP, and MGSLCSR-Nt 7 -GFP were cut with EcoRI/NotI and inserts were ligated into the same sites of pAc5.1/V5-HisA (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The full-length G\u03b1o mutants MGNC-G\u03b1o and MGSLCSR-G\u03b1o were PCRamplified from G\u03b1o-GFP, cut and inserted in frame into the KpnI/ApaI sites of pEGFP-N1.For the generation of G\u03b1o-Nt 7 -FM 4 -GFP and MGNC-Nt 7 -FM 4 -GFP, the FM 4 sequence was PCR-amplified from the GFP-FM 4 -hGH plasmid (Andrew Peden, University of Sheffield), cut with AgeI/PstI and ligated in frame into the same sites of G\u03b1o-Nt 7 -GFP and MGNC-Nt 7 -FM 4 -GFP. The mRFP-G\u03b21 construct was created by exchanging the AgeI/BsrGI mCerulean sequence from mCerulean-G\u03b21 63 with the corresponding from pmRFP-C1 (Claudia Stuermer, University of Konstanz). Similarly, the mRFP-G\u03b33 was created by substituting the AgeI/BsrGI GFP sequence in the GFP-G\u03b33 plasmid5 with the mRFP sequence. The mRFP-Lact-C2 was done by replacing the AgeI/BsrGI GFP sequence from GFP-Lact-C2 (kindly provided by Gregory Fairn; University of Toronto) with the sequence from pmRFP-C1.MannII-mRFP was created by exchanging the BamHI/NotI sequence from MannII-BFP 64 with the equivalent sequence from pmRFP-N1 (Claudia Stuermer, University of Konstanz). The mRFP-KASH and BFP-KASH plasmids were cloned by substituting the AgeI/BsrGI GFP sequence in the GFP-KASH plasmid65 with the analogous sequence from pmRFP-C1 and pEBFP2-C1 (Addgene, 54665), respectively. The plasmid for the non-tagged SUN2 expression was cloned by cutting the SUN2-CFP plasmid66 with EcoRI and BamHI, blunting with Phusion DNA Polymerase (New England Biolabs), and re-ligating the plasmid thus introducing a stop codon in frame with the SUN2 sequence. The SUN2-GFP was generated by replacing the SalI/NotI CFP fragment with the XhoI/NotI GFP fragment from pEGFP-N1.The mRFP-zDHHC5 wild-type and DHHS-mutant were cloned by cutting the BamHI/NotI sequence of pCI-neo-Flag-DHHC5 and pCI-neo-Flag-DHHS567 , and ligating in frame into the BglII/PspOMI sites of pmRFP-C1. For the generation of mRFP-zDHHC5-KASH wild-type and DHHS-mutant, the sequences mRFP-zDHHC5 and mRFP-zDHHS5 were PCR-amplified from mRFP-fusions, cut with NheI/KpnI and used to exchange the GFP sequence cut with the same enzymes from GFP-KASH. Masaki Fukata (National Institutes of Natural Sciences, Japan) generously provided a collection of 23 mouse zDHHC isoforms cloned into the pEF-Bos-HA plasmid 36 . Slightly different cloning strategies were used for the generation of all mRFP-zDHHC-KASH constructs. Specifically, the zDHHC2, 11 and 18 sequences were PCR-amplified from the corresponding pEF-Bos-HA plasmids, cut with AgeI/KpnI and ligated in frame into the BspEI/KpnI sites of mRFP-KASH and also BFP-KASH for zDHHC11. The sequence for zDHHC1, 3, 7, 12, 13, 15, 16, 20, 21, and 25 were PCR-amplified from the original pEF-Bos-HA plasmids, cut with BglII/EcoRI and inserted into the same sites of mRFP-KASH. The zDHHC8 sequence was PCR-amplified from pEF-Bos-HA-DHHC8, cut with XhoI/EcoRI and ligated into the same sites of mRFP-KASH. zDHHC9 was PCRamplified from pEF-Bos-HA-DHHC9, cut with SacI/BamHI and ligated into the same sites of mRFP-KASH. The zDHHC14 sequence was PCR-amplified from pEF-Bos-HA-DHHC14, cut with AgeI/BamHI and ligated into the BspEI/BamHI sites of mRFP-KASH. The zDHHC17 and 23 were PCR-amplified from the corresponding pEF-Bos-HA plasmids, cut with BglII/HindIII and inserted into the same sites of mRFP-KASH. All inactive DHHS-mutants for the relevant mRFP-zDHHC-KASH and HA-zDHHC constructs were obtained by point mutagenesis. The GFP-fusion of reggie-1/flotillin-2 was previously described 68 . Tamas Balla (National Institutes of Health) kindly provided the FAPP1-PH-GFP plasmid, Bo van Deurs (University of Copenhagen) the GFP-caveolin-1 construct, Scott Dixon (Stanford University) the GCP16/Golga7-Flag, and Mark Collins (University of Sheffield) the Golga7b-Flag. The GFP-SNAP23 69 and pGEX6P1-GFP-Nanobody 70 plasmids were obtained from Addgene. Structure alignment The G\u03b1o structures 6g79, 6oik, and 6k41 were aligned using the PyMOL software (pymol.org). The N-terminal \u03b1 -helix of 6g79 was set as reference to align all structures. A similar alignment was done for the G\u03b1i1 structures 1gg2, 5kdo, 6ddf, 6osa, 6n4b, 6kpf, and 6k42, setting the N-terminal \u03b1 -helix of 5kdo as reference. IDs and G\u03b1 structures were obtained from RCSB-PDB (rcsb.org). Immunofluorescence and microscopy For microscopy, N2a and HeLa cells were transfected for 7 hr, trypsinized and seeded on poly-L-lysine-coated coverslips in complete MEM for additional 15 hr before fixation. When indicated, cells were seeded in complete MEM supplemented with 10 \u00b5M DDD85646 or 100 \u00b5M 2-bromopalmitate. S2 cells were transfected for 24 hr, washed one time with PBS, resuspended in complete media, and seeded on poly-L-lysine-coated coverslips for 30 min before fixation. All cells were fixed for 20 min with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS. For immunostaining, cells were permeabilized for 1 min using ice-cold PBS supplemented with 0.1% Triton X-100, blocked for 30 min with PBS supplemented with 1% BSA, incubated with the primary antibody in blocking buffer for 2 hr at room temperature (RT), washed and subsequently incubated with secondary antibodies and DAPI in blocking buffer for 2 hr at RT.All fluorescent-labelled secondary antibodies were from Jackson ImmunoResearch.",

Supernatants were incubated overnight with anti-GFP agarose beads (Cat# GTA-100; Chromotek), beads were then washed several times, and incubated for 10 min at room temperature with 1M hydroxylamine, pH 7.4 (Cat# 159417; Sigma-Aldrich) or 2M Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. Beads were finally prepared for and loaded into a 4-20% gradient SDS-PAGE. One third of the immnunoprecipitate was analyzed by WB using antibody against GFP, and two thirds were used for fluorography on film. The metabolic labeling was done in triplicate with similar outcomes.Protein-lipid overlay assayAfter 24 hr of transfection, N2a cells were washed twice with TBS (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl and 10% glycerol) and cell extracts were prepared as explained above in TBS supplemented with 0.5% Tx-100 and protease inhibitors. Membrane lipid strips were blocked in 3% BSA in TBS supplemented with 0.1% Tween-20 (TBS-T) for 1 hr at 4\u00b0C. Then, strips were incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C with cleared cell extracts previously diluted 1/10 in TBS-T supplemented with 1% BSA. Strips were incubated first with a pAb against GFP, and then with a secondary HRP-conjugated pAb to detect GFP-constructs bound to lipid dots. The protein-lipid overlay assay was done in duplicate for each condition with very similar results. Reverse dimerization assay HeLa cells were co-transfected with the Golgi marker GalT-mRFP (not shown in all figures) and G\u03b1o-Nt 7 -FM 4 -GFP, MGNC-Nt 7 -FM 4 -GFP or GFP-FM 4 -hGH (at a 1:3 plasmid ratio), and seeded on poly-L-lysine-coated coverslips for 15 hr as indicated above. Then, cells were incubated for 2 hr at normal culture conditions in HBSS supplemented with 20 mM HEPES, Cycloheximide to block de novo synthesis of proteins. The reverse dimerization was induced by adding fresh HBSS supplemented as above plus 1 \u00b5M D/D solubilizer for the time indicated in the corresponding figures. For temperature block of Golgi transport, the last two steps were simultaneously performed at 37\u00b0C and 20\u00b0C. Then, cells were fixed and prepared for microscopy. Quantification of fluorescence intensity at the MannII-mRFP Golgi region was done as described above. Student's t test was used for statistical analysis of \u2265 40 cells per condition and from 3 independent experiments.For the live imaging of reverse dimerization, HeLa cells were transfected as above but seeded on \u00b5-Slide-4-wells coverslips (Ibidi). Cell were first incubated for 30 min at 37\u00b0C in Hank's Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS; Gibco) supplemented with 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.
