Current U.S. and WHO initiatives call for the elimination of HIV and HCV by 2030. 3, 4 Life-saving pharmaceutical advancements in the past decadedirect-acting antivirals (DAAs) to cure HCV, antiretroviral treatment (ART) for HIV management, and pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for HIV prevention-have transformed these calls into tangible goals. 5 The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic likely impeded progress towards treating and eliminating HCV and HIV. Using data from a large clinical laboratory test provider with sites across the U.S., 1 study observed a 59% reduction in HCV antibody testing during April 2020. 6 Moreover, several reports document reduced HIV testing and delayed HIV care appointments following the initial outbreak. In a case study from New York, community-based organizations reported disruptions in all HIV care continuum services during April 2020, including testing, PrEP, and primary care. 7 Another case study from an academic medical center in Chicago documented a shift to telemedicine following \"shelter in place\" orders in late March 2020. During the next month, 45 of 98 scheduled HIV care visits were not attended nor were rescheduled. 8 These studies suggest that the outbreak was associated with fewer opportunities to diagnose HCV and HIV; however, they did not directly examine U.S. dispensing of DAAs, ART, and PrEP. Documenting national changes in dispensing of these drugs is essential to motivate action by clinicians and policymakers to ensure access to life-saving treatments for patients with HIV and HCV.",

These counts are reported overall and according to patient age group, method of payment for prescriptions, and whether prescriptions are new prescriptions versus refills of a new prescription. In this context, \"new\" does not necessarily imply that the patient had no prior use of the drug; rather, it implies that the prescription was not a refill.

This is a particularly important group from the perspective of public health, as it disproportionately accounts for people who inject drugs and have HCV, a highly marginalized population with substantial barriers to care. 15 Additionally, this study found that dispensing of both new and refill prescriptions for DAAs decreased following the outbreak. This finding raises the possibility that both initiation and completion of DAA therapy were disrupted by the pandemic. Notably, because the study dataset does not report days supplied of prescriptions, it could not be determined whether the decrease in DAA refills reflected a shift towards the provision of larger new prescriptions, obviating the need for refills. Future research should assess the reasons for observed decreases in new and refill DAA prescriptions, using datasets with individual patient identifiers and prescription duration.",

The authors speculate that a potential reason is the unprecedented shift towards delivering care for chronic diseases using telehealth during the pandemic. 18 Notably, patients living with HIV who receive ART include those who know their status and have consistent access to care. In 2019, an estimated 13% of Americans living with HIV did not know they have the virus; moreover, of all patients diagnosed with HIV in 2019, 24% did not receive any HIV medical care. 19 Thus, while the apparent lack of decrease in dispensing of ART is reassuring, gaps in identifying patients with undiagnosed HIV and initiating ART in these patients remain.",

            "text": "PrEP dispensing did not change substantially after the outbreak overall and for most age groups. This is potentially surprising given that other studies of PrEP use during the pandemic have shown decreased use. 20 Small studies with self-reported data conducted outside the U.S. One potential explanation for the discrepancy is the use of national medication dispensing data from the U.S. Another potential explanation is mismeasurement of PrEP dispensing. This analysis assumed that all use of the 3 PrEP drugs were for PrEP as opposed to ART. If it could have differentiated between dispensing of these drugs by indication, it is possible that it would have similarly found decreased PrEP use. Future studies should assess PrEP use during the pandemic using data sources that have information on indication, such as insurance claims and electronic health records. If PrEP dispensing was indeed stable during the pandemic, studies should explore why use did not decrease. Possibilities include the local rollout of the federal program Ready, Set, PrEP starting in December 2019, 23 the introduction of generic PrEP in September 2020, 11 and the growing availability of online prescribing and dispensing of PrEP. 24 The one age group for which PrEP dispensing changed was patients aged 0-19 years. In this age group, the pre-existing decline in the rate of dispensing attenuated after the COVID-19 outbreak, resulting in an essentially flat trend. While the reasons for these findings are unclear, this is of clinical and public policy concern in light of evidence suggesting underuse of PrEP in adolescents with the greatest risk for HIV. 25 The authors' ability to capture recent national data on dispensing of DAAs, ART and PrEP stands in stark contrast to the 2 year-lag for national statistics reporting the incidence, prevalence, and treated prevalence for HIV and HCV. Data on disease incidence and prevalence are critical aspects of efforts to reduce and even eliminate HCV and HIV. Policymakers should invest the resources needed to obtain these data in a timelier fashion. The authors join Barocas et al. call for recommitting resources to screen, link, and treat people with HCV 26 and HIV.",

In October 2019, the month in which Descovy\u00ae gained FDA approval for PrEP, there was an abrupt jump in aggregate dispensing of Descovy\u00ae and Truvada\u00ae. Because including data prior to this month would have distorted pre-intervention trends, analyses of PrEP dispensing began in October 2019. To assess changes in dispensing of DAAs and ARTs after the outbreak, the authors calculated the unadjusted year-over-year change in dispensing between March 2019-Februrary 2020 and March 2020-February 2021. Authors did not calculate this change for PrEP for similar reasons as above.

Authors conducted 3 sensitivity analysis. First, because the 3 PrEP drugs are also approved for ART, authors reanalyzed ART dispensing when including these drugs in the definition of ART. Second, rather than define the outbreak as April 2020, authors defined the outbreak as March 2020 and excluded data from this month as a washout period. Third, authors repeated segmented regression models when modeling the number of dispensed prescriptions instead of the number of dispensed prescriptions per 100,000 Americans.
