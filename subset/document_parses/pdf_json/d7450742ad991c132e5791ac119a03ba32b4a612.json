We constructed PS matched cohorts to mitigate the impact of confounders. PSs for COVID-19 risk were calculated using logistic regressions including the following covariates: age, sex, medical aid coverage, and CCI. Each patient with COVID-19 was matched with up to 10 test negative controls using the greedy neighbor nearest-matching algorithm (Fig.  1) . The model was further adjusted in a logistic regression analysis, using age, sex, insurance medical aid coverage, and comorbidities, as covariates.

Moreover, higher BMI and FBS \u2265126 mg/dL were more significantly associated with COVID-19 in females than in males. Some previous studies reported that there may be gender differences in susceptibility to COVID-19 [16, 17] , and the present study results also suggest this. Interestingly, classes 2 and 3 obesity were significantly associated with increased COVID-19 risk in <50 years age group, while a similar but not significant trend was shown in the older age groups. A small retrospective study reported obesity as a predictive factor affecting COV-ID-19 severity in young adults <40 years old [18] . This previous report is supported by findings of our study indicating that obesity may have a greater impact on COVID-19 in younger adults.",

We used data of patients who underwent health checkups in 2018 or later, and it is possible that these patients were more likely to have undergone health checkups, as they may have had more comorbidities. However, to mitigate this confounding factor, we used a robust design with the PS matched analysis. Moreover, we consider that the results reflected more accurately the current body weight, because we used the most recent heath checkup data. Second, we were unable to evaluate the mechanism of the relationship between obesity and COVID-19. However, this study findings confirmed the association between obesity and COVID-19 and we recommend that detailed mechanisms of the relationship be evaluated by further experimental research.",
