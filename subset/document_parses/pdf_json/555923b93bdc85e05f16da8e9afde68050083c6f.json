We considered the likelihood-based R0 using a branching process with Poisson likelihood. Bootstrapping with 1000 times resampling was used for obtaining the distribution and confidence interval of R0. We then used the estimates of R0, SI, and daily incidence to simulate the trajectories and project the future daily cumulative incidence where the main assumption was that the model follows a Poisson distribution [11] . For each date 2, the number of incident cases I t was drawn from a Poisson distribution with mean R t \u2211 t s=1 I t-s W s , where R t is the instantaneous reproduction number, W s is the discrete SI distribution and I t-s is the incidence at time step t -s.",

The interpretation of R0 estimates derived from totally different models needs associate understanding of the models' structures, inputs, and interactions. as a result of several researchers using R0 haven't been trained in refined mathematical techniques, R0 is well subject to misrepresentation, misinterpretation, and misapplication. The variations in R0 values is also attributed to different ways and models of R0 estimation. R0 can be misrepresented, misinterpreted, and misused in a variety of ways that distort the metric's true meaning and value. Because of these various sources of misperception, R0 must be applied and discussed with cautiousness in research and practice [20] [21] [22] [23] . Regarding contagiousness disease, R0 is dependent on the rate of contact of people in the community, probability of transmition in each contact and duration of infectiousness, so applying approaches to reduce social contacts plays an important role in reducing this index [24] . The decrease in R0 value in this study upon time may be attributed to the enhancement of social distancing and self-quarantine policies. Specific conditions must be met for a valid estimation. These conditions are: a. complete detection of cases in the early days of the epidemic, b. calculation for a small timeline, and c. using an appropriate estimation method. R0 can be different according to the patterns of people's contacts, structure of population and different subpopulations. In early stage of an epidemic, precisely estimating R0 is problematic, because the exact number of cases is not clear [25] . Yang et al. showed that by a self-quarantine, R0 value declines from 3.77 to 3.00 [26] . The physical distancing, quarantine, closing schools, and workplace distancing have been shown that were effective in decreasing R0 in Singapore [27] . As the number of people who became probably immune during the study is a small percentage of Alborz population, its contribution to R0 change seems negligible.",

Our findings demonstrate north to west and west to the east path of the epidemic, concluding that the incidence of COVID-19 is higher in dense areas of Karaj city, especially in eastern Karaj, which most of the population in the city are situated. While it took about two and a half years for MERS and four months for SARS to infect 1000 people, the novel SARS-CoV-2 infected about two-million people worldwide in 4 months.
