The results of trials can only be confidently interpreted if the delivery of the intervention was systematic and the protocol adhered to. We systematically reviewed trials of anaesthetic interventions published in 12 journals from January 2016 to September 2019. We assessed the detail with which interventions were reported, using the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials statement for non-pharmacological treatments. We analysed 162 interventions reported by 78 trials in 18,675 participants. Detail sufficiently precise to replicate the intervention was reported for 111 (69%) interventions. Intervention standardisation was reported for 135 (83%) out of the 162 interventions, and protocol adherence was reported for 20 (12%) interventions. Sixty (77%) out of the 78 trials reported the administrative context in which interventions were delivered and 36 (46%) trials detailed the expertise of the practitioners. We conclude that bespoke reporting tools should be developed for anaesthetic interventions and interventions in other areas such as critical care.",

We assessed descriptions of the dose, volume, concentration, route and timing of drugs for anaesthesia and sedation. For general anaesthesia these included induction and maintenance, neuromuscular blockade and opioids. For local anaesthetics we also assessed site and, where applicable, sensory and motor blocks. We assessed descriptions of depth of anaesthesia and sedation, airway management and anaesthetic monitoring. We used the training grade to characterise 'operator expertise' for anaesthetists (item 15). We defined 'standardisation' as a process \"to establish a standard consisting of regulations for how something is to be done\" (https://www.collinsdictiona ry.com/about). We recorded how standard anaesthetic protocols were regulated and why and whether personnel adhered to them [3, 23] . We recorded crossover of participants between trial arms. We did not assess the adherence of participants to the intervention (item 5d). We used the revised Cochrane risk of bias tool to assess: the randomisation process; deviations from the intended interventions; missing outcome data; measurement of the outcome; and selection of the reported result [24] . We did not undertake formal statistic comparisons, in keeping with similar systematic reviews of reporting standards in other research areas [25, 26] .",
