The patient referred to the hospital reporting a history of ten days lasting moderate fever, myalgia and anosmia, with the onset of progressive quadriparesis and ascending paraesthesias in the four limbs since five days from defervescence. A chest computed tomography demonstrated interstitial pneumonia with \"ground glass opacities\", suggesting Coronavirus disease . The patient exhibited three negative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) nasopharyngeal swabs, while SARS-CoV-2 IgG was found in plasma. The electrophysiological examination demonstrated an AMAN and the spinal cord Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) showed a T2-weighted hyperintense lesion in the posterior part of the spinal cord at the C7-D1 levels. Furthermore, anti-GD1b IgM was detected. GBS and myelitis could exceptionally develop simultaneously. Our findings reasonably support a causality link between COVID-19 and the neurological symptoms, suggesting a post-infective autoimmune reaction.",

In lower limbs, a mild increase in distal latencies and a bilateral impairment of F-waves were present. The axonopathic features were confirmed in the follow-up electrophysiological examination, conducted after 6 weeks (see Table 1 for further details). Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) showed no lesions in brain, whereas it demonstrated an area of hyperintensity in T2-weighted sequences in the posterior portion of the spinal cord. This area had a cylindrical shape in the sagittal view and encompassed two vertebral levels (C7-D1), without T1-weighted hypointensity and inflammatory activity after gadolinium administration (Fig. 1) . A follow-up spinal cord MRI, performed five days later, showed no differences in the cervical lesion and no other lesion neither in the thoracic nor in the lumbar segments.",
