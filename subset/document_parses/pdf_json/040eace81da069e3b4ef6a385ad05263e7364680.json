For instance, differences exist in postural control strategy, the CoP displacement, and muscle activation patterns between people with and without non-specific LBP [11] . A greater postural instability, denoted by higher CoP velocity and excursions, has been found in people with non-specific LBP compared to healthy controls [12] . Their impaired postural stability seems to be associated with the presence of pain, whereas it is not related to the exact location and pain duration.

Both the CoP and center of mass (CoM) variables should be measured in dynamic conditions with higher task demands. Standing on a spring-supported platform or a foam surface during testing is more efficient in identifying within-and between-group differences when compared to tests of static balance [13] . A good discriminatory accuracy in differentiating between sedentary and physically active young adults was also reported during a perturbation-based balance tests [14] . On the other hand, there were no significant differences in the magnitudes of CoP and CoM displacements in the mediolateral direction during unexpected surface translation in individuals with chronic LBP and healthy controls [15] . However, those with chronic LBP showed an earlier peak CoM displacement and later onset of initial CoP displacement [15] . Nonetheless, readjustment of postural stability in the anteroposterior direction after perturbations elicited by weight unloading has yet to be investigated.",

Such a measurement has been recommended as a standard for lifting tasks [19] . This was based on evidence that lower isometric strength is associated with LBP. However, the risk of back problems increases threefold when the requirements for lifting tasks are beyond or equal to their strength capacity. Static strength measurements underestimate the loads on the spine under dynamic conditions. The predicted spinal loads are 33-60% less under static than dynamic conditions depending on the lifting technique [20] . The recruitment patterns of trunk muscles and thus the internal loading of the spine are also different under these two conditions. Therefore, tests performed under dynamic conditions seem to be more appropriate for healthy as well as LBP populations. An exercise in the form of a deadlift to high pull that involves the major muscle groups in the lower and upper body may be able to simulate lifting tasks [21] . In such a case, a predictor of lifting performance with light loads might be a peak rate of force development (RFD) produced during a maximum voluntary isometric contraction (MVC) of the back muscles [22] . Thus, besides MVC peak force generated by back muscles, the subjects' ability to produce a maximum force in a short period of time should by determined to obtain further insight into the loaded lifting performance in those prone to LBP.",

Though there is the belief that an association exists between a stronger body core and shorter reaction time, or stronger lower limbs and faster recovery, there is also an opposite view that suggests that stronger lower limbs contribute to slower recovery [23] . Therefore, a question remains as to whether reactive balance control after unpredictable stimuli is associated with the strength of relevant muscle groups in the high-risk population of healthcare workers. This paper presents a protocol for a cross-sectional study that will investigate the relationship between peak anterior to peak posterior displacements of the CoP and corresponding time from peak anterior to peak posterior displacements of the CoP after sudden external perturbations and peak force during MVCs of the back and hamstring muscles in physiotherapists with non-specific back pain, in particular those with mild to moderate back pain. We will also investigate how the ability to produce maximum force in a short period of time during MVCs of the back and hamstring muscles relates to postural responses to externally induced perturbations in a control group without back pain.",

The ODI consists of 10 questions with a single choice of 6 answers. The VAS is a measurement instrument to measure the strength of pain experienced by a patient. Using a ruler, the score is determined by measuring the distance (mm) on a 10 cm line between 'no pain at all' and 'my pain is as bad as it could be'. The patient marks a score from 0-10.

The load release will produce a sudden change in the external forces acting on the participant that will lead to a slight anterior and a greater posterior CoP displacement. This postural perturbation will cause only a sway response, so the participant will not need to perform a step to maintain balance.

Participants, after a warm-up, will perform three 5 s isometric contractions with maximal effort on each leg at 90 \u2022 of knee flexion while lying on the rehabilitation bed in the prone position. This knee flexion angle is based on findings that showed high reliability of isometric posterior lower limb muscle force [33] . In a randomized design, the left and right leg peak force will be registered. The best result from the three attempts will be taken for the analysis.",

This method could provide feedback about whether those with higher peak RFD during MVC of relevant muscle groups are capable of responding effectively to unexpected postural perturbations. It can be implemented in healthy subjects who may benefit from such testing by predicting their LBP risk. Revealing impaired postural and/or core stability and reduced strength of relevant muscle groups could support self-help strategies in the prevention of back problems by the application of hiptrunk stabilization and strengthening exercises in their daily activities. This may contribute to a reduction in chronic back problems and consequently lowering healthcare system costs. ",
