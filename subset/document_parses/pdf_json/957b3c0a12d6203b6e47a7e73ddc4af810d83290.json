Newer techniques enhance that information and the time interval for obtaining results. An audit of diagnostic microbiology utilisation, microbiological aetiology, and influence of results on prescribing practices in CAP in a regional Australian hospital setting was performed. Methods: Clinical, microbiological and outcome data were collected by medical record review of patients discharged from Ballarat Hospital with a diagnosis of CAP over a 12 month period. Results: Of 184 identified CAP episodes, 47 (25.5%) had no diagnostic microbiology performed. Respiratory virus polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was rarely performed (2.7% of all episodes). Acute serology was frequently requested, however paired acute and convalescent serology was infrequently performed (5/75 testing episodes; 6.7%). CAP severity was not correlated with microbiological investigation intensity. The most common pathogens identified were Streptococcus pneumoniae and Mycoplasma pneumoniae (5.4% and 2.2%, respectively). Diagnostic testing appeared to rarely influence antimicrobial prescribing.

Blood cultures have limited sensitivity in CAP, but excellent specificity once contaminants are excluded. 3 Their greater utility is in the ability to provide prognostic information, facilitate monitoring of antimicrobial susceptibility profiles of invasive pathogens, allow detection of unexpected bacteraemia (e.g., infective endocarditis) or important pathogens (e.g., S. aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa) and provide a clue for identifying patients with underlying predisposing conditions (e.g., pneumococcal bacteraemia and HIV or hyposplenism).

This is lower than previously reported (19.7%) and possibly related to stricter sputum analysis criteria. 1 Sputum identified a likely pathogen in 10 episodes, and appeared to influence antimicrobial prescribing in only two episodes (2.7% of episodes where a sputum was collected). Sputum analysis is non-invasive, relatively cheap, potentially influences patient management and allows epidemiological surveillance of CAP pathogens and associated antimicrobial susceptibility. However limitations include inherent poor specificity, and the difficulty in detecting pathogens such as M. pneumoniae, Legionella species and Chlamydophila species. Given the low rate of influence of sputum diagnostics, it could be argued that sputum collection be avoided in mild to moderate CAP unless there is clinical suspicion of resistant or unusual pathogens (e.g., S. aureus, P. aeruginosa, Mycobacteria species, Nocardia species, Acinetobacter baumanii, Burkholderia pseudomallei), or failure to respond to therapy. Only 2.7% of patients underwent testing for respiratory viruses (2.9% for moderate to severe CAP) and this accounts for the low rate of respiratory virus identification (0.5%). Respiratory viruses are becoming increasingly recognised as causes of CAP, and identification allows therapeutic intervention, accurate implementation of infection control practices, while also informing vaccination and public health policy and providing valuable supportive evidence for vaccination to patients and staff. 20, 21 Possible explanations for low testing rates include perceived lack of a therapeutic intervention, moderate influenza activity during the study period and because of a perceived delay in receipt of results due to specimen referral to an external laboratory. 22 Given the recent pandemic of H1N1 influenza A, an increase in diagnostic testing for influenza pneumonia may be expected. Additionally, it has only been relatively recently that multiplex respiratory virus nucleic acid amplification tests of flocculated swabs of the nasopharynx have become readily available. 23 The absolute yield of respiratory virus PCR was limited in this study due to low utilisation. Published studies have demonstrated a yield of 12-13% for respiratory virus PCR in CAP, which is relatively high for CAP investigations. 21, 24 Thus, this test should be recommended for all inpatients with moderate to severe CAP, or those with clinical or epidemiological features suggestive of a viral aetiology, particularly during seasonal peaks. An important caveat is that although molecular techniques for respiratory viruses have been reported to increase microbiological diagnostic sensitivity in CAP, the significance of detecting pathogens such as coronaviruses and rhinoviruses remains uncertain. 20 Additionally, testing in smaller centres may be associated with significant costs and time delays due to specimen referral.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 166, "end": 167, "text": "3", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 368, "end": 369, "text": "1", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 1765, "end": 1768, "text": "20,", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 1769, "end": 1771, "text": "21", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 2029, "end": 2031, "text": "22", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 2342, "end": 2344, "text": "23", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 2576, "end": 2579, "text": "21,", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 2580, "end": 2582, "text": "24", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 3047, "end": 3049, "text": "20", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "Of those with moderate to severe CAP, 20.2% had LUAT and 15.4% had PUAT performed. Urine is more commonly available for testing than sputum, and with a rapid turn around time and greater sensitivity and specificity than sputum, urinary antigen studies should be the preferred investigation option for those with moderate to severe CAP. Disadvantages include lack of antimicrobial susceptibility information, cost and the limited serotypes detected by LUAT (only L. pneumophila serotype 1 is reliably detected, which accounts for 80-95% of community acquired legionella). 3, 25 Additionally, the yield of PUAT and LUAT was low at 5.7% and 0%, respectively. Nevertheless, a positive result allows antibiotic rationalisation, may limit further diagnostic testing and facilitates early detection of Legionella outbreaks. 4 In this study, paired acute and convalescent serological evaluation was rarely performed (in only 5/75 instances where acute serology was performed was convalescent serology performed). Aside from M. pneumoniae IgM testing, isolated evaluation of acute serological samples is rarely helpful and can be misleading. A more rational approach would be to store acute samples and await a convalescent sample before testing both in parallel. Yield of serological testing was highest for M. pneumoniae, however the specificity of a single antibody titre !160 (the definition used in this study, as recommended by the manufacturer), has been criticised. 26 Serological tests remain vital for pathogens where identification via other means is limited (e.g., M. pneumoniae, Chlamydophila species and C. burnetti), however molecular techniques have improved diagnostic accuracy and timing. 12, 21 Local availability and cost restrict the widespread implementation of these techniques. 12 Given limitations of serological studies, little influence on antimicrobial prescribing would be expected, and is supported by this study where antimicrobial prescribing appeared to be influenced by only one of 75 serological tests performed.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 571, "end": 573, "text": "3,", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 574, "end": 576, "text": "25", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 817, "end": 818, "text": "4", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1465, "end": 1467, "text": "26", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 1698, "end": 1701, "text": "12,", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 1702, "end": 1704, "text": "21", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 1793, "end": 1795, "text": "12", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "To summarise the above controversies, Table 2 provides recommendations for diagnostic microbiology in CAP.
