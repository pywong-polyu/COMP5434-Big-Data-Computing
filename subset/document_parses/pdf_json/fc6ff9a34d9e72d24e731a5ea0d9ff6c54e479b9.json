            "text": "We use data from aggregate stock and dividend futures markets to quantify how investors' expectations about economic growth evolved across horizons following the outbreak of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) and subsequent policy responses until July 2020. Dividend futures, which are claims to dividends on the aggregate stock market in a particular year, can be used to directly compute a lower bound on growth expectations across maturities or to estimate expected growth using a forecasting model. We show how the actual forecast and the bound evolve over time. As of July 20th, our forecast of annual growth in dividends points to a decline of 8% in both the United States and Japan and a 14% decline in the European Union compared to January 1. Our forecast of GDP growth points to a decline of 2% in the United States and Japan and 3% in the European Union. The lower bound on the change in expected dividends is -17% in the United States and Japan and -28% in the European Union at the 2-year horizon. News about U.S. monetary policy and the fiscal stimulus bill around March 24 boosted the stock market and long-term growth but did little to increase short-term growth expectations. Expected dividend growth has improved since April 1 in all geographies. (JEL G12, G31)",

Alternatively, we can try to extract information from asset prices, such as stocks, bonds (Harvey (1989) ), and credits (Gilchrist and Zakrajsek (2012) ), as they are forward looking. It is therefore unsurprising that, in particular, movements in the stock market have received a lot of attention. In this paper, we offer a perspective on how to interpret movements in the stock market and what they tell us about growth expectations by combining stock market data with asset pricing data from other markets. 1 Equity markets in the European Union, Japan, and the United States dropped by as much as 30%, an extraordinary amount. To interpret this decline, it is useful to recall that the value of the stock market, S t , is equal to the discounted value of all future dividends",

If the stock market falls, then either the expected future dividends fall or investors will discount future dividends at a higher rate; that is, \u00b5 (n) t rises. For the stock market to decline by 30% only due to revised growth expectations, the shock to future dividends needs to be large and highly persistent. It would be, for instance, inconsistent with a V-shaped recovery. To see this, we can sum the value of dividends during the first 10 years and find that this accounts for about 20% of the value of the stock market. This implies that if discount rates do not move and if the economic impact on dividends lasts no more than 10 years, a 30% decline in the stock market would mean that firms pay no dividends in 1 A large literature explores the implications for the cross-section of stock returns (for an early contribution, see Ramelli and Wagner (2020) ). In addition, a growing literature studies the impact of the COVID-19 crisis on intermediaries, such as for instance mutual funds (Pastor and Vorsatz, 2020) . the next 10 years, a seemingly rather extreme scenario. It would be more consistent with an L-shaped recovery in which dividends permanently drop by 30%, with no catch-up growth. However, focusing on fundamentals only is typically not the right way to interpret movements in the stock market. The seminal work by Shiller (1981) and Campbell and Shiller (1988) shows that most of the variation in the value of the stock market is due to changes in expected returns, \u00b5 (n) t , not revisions in expected future growth rates. See Cochrane (2011) for an excellent review. This insight brings good and bad news. The good news is that investors' expectations did not decline as dramatically as in the earlier calculation. The bad news, however, is that we learn little about growth expectations by taking cues from the stock market. Instead, we learn about investors' changes in discount rates that may be driven by shifts in risk aversion, sentiment, or uncertainty about long-run growth.",

As we find it unlikely that long-run dividends, in levels, are hit harder than near-term dividends, the drop must come from discount rates. 3 Hence, prices on the market and the futures jointly suggest that discount rates initially increased substantially on long-maturity claims, such as the market portfolio. 4 We formalize this analysis at the end of the paper.",

On July 20, the S&P 500 trades at $3,251, which is $135 lower than the peak of $3,386 on February 19. This drop can largely be explained by the first 10 years of dividends, as they are down by a total of $112. As such, the distant-future dividends, the dividends beyond year 10, must have approximately the same value as before the crisis. If expected long-run dividends are the same as before the crisis, expected returns on the long-run dividends must therefore also be the same as before the crisis.

The lower bound bottoms out between 1 and 2 years into the future, with expected dividends being revised downward by as much as 17% in the United States and Japan and 28% in the European Union at the 2-year horizon. The lower bound increases from years 2 to 7 in European Union and Japan, which is consistent with investors expecting catch-up growth after the recession. We emphasize that the estimates represent lower bounds and that actual expected growth is likely higher. Figure 3 shows the lower bound. The lower bound on dividend growth expectations is revised downward by as much as 17% in the United States and Japan, and 28% in the European Union, at the 2-year horizon. Keep in mind that the lower bound represents the revision in expected growth rates relative to previous expectations, not a lower bound on the actual growth rate. If investors expected a nominal growth rate of 6% annually prior to the outbreak, the expected growth for the 2-year horizon would be more than 12%. Revising the 2-year growth expectations downward by 18% would thus imply a negative growth of \"only\" 6% over a 2-year horizon. In addition, we measure a lower bound that is equal to the actual expectations only when expected excess returns did not go up. Next, we discuss our methodology, which requires additional assumptions, for computing an estimate of expected growth.",

These observations underline the severity of the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on financial markets. Figure 4 shows the lower bound during the GFC. The blue line plots the lower bound on revisions in expected dividends between July 31, 2008, and November 31, 2008. The red line plots the subsequent realized dividends measured relative to a precrisis trend of around 4% growth. 11 For the S&P 500, the lower bound on changes in expected dividends lines up well with the realized dividends at the short end. For Euro Stoxx 50, realizations are slightly below the bound at the short end, above the bound in the middle, and around the bound at the long end. 12 For Nikkei 225, the realizations line up well with the lower bound on the short end and the middle but are higher on the long end. It is comforting that even during a period of high financial turbulence, futures prices appear well linked to fundamentals and to align well with realizations. Figure 4 also plots the lower bound following the outbreak of COVID-19. On March 23, when the stock market hit bottom, the bound is lower than observed during the financial crisis, but the curve represents more catch-up growth, particularly in Europe. 11 We measure the growth rates as the real growth in dividends observed between 1947 and 2007, which is close to 2% plus 2% for expected long-run inflation in 2007. 12 We note, however, that the low realized dividends on the long end could reflect the European sovereign debt crisis of 2011, which was probably unexpected in 2008.",

At the end of 2019, there are around 1 million contracts outstanding. Each contract is for a 100 dividend points and trades at around EUR 12,000 depending on the maturity. This gives a total notional outstanding of around EUR 12 billion. The total number of contracts increases from around 800,000 to 1,200,000 during the spring of 2020, but the notional measured in EUR drops because the value of the futures decreases.

To this end, we fit a simple model for dividend prices that we require to simultaneously price the dividend futures as well as the aggregate stock market. Starting from (1), we observe the dividend prices for the first 10 years, and we observe S t . We model expected growth minus the expected excess return, g n t \u2212\u03b8 n t , as a function of maturity. The functional form that we fit in each period follows Nelson and Siegel (1987) . Figure 9 presents the results for the S&P 500. In the initial phase of the stock market drop, from the peak on February 19 to March 5, the market declines due to a drop in the value of the distant-future dividends. We maintain the assumption that distant-future dividends are expected to fall less than near-future dividends because of the nature of pandemics, so the large drop in the value of distant-future dividends cannot come from decreases in expected dividends but instead must be due to an increase in discount rates. Such increases in discount rates on distantfuture claims is commonly observed during times of stress (Gormsen (2020) ). From March 5 to 12, a period in which growth expectations changed sharply, we see that prices on both near-and distant-future dividends fall sharply. Finally, from March 12 to July 20, a period during which the stock market recovers, we see that the value of distant-future dividends increases, whereas the value of the very near-future dividends continues to decrease. Since the value of the distant-future dividends largely returns to precrisis levels, one could reasonably conjecture that the discount rates on these distant-future dividends also have returned to precrisis levels. Taken together, Figure 9 illustrates how the crash of the stock market was driven by a drop in the value of both near-and distant-future dividends, whereas the rebound was largely driven by a recovery in the value of distant-future dividends.",

It is well known that it is oftentimes difficult to identify the economic shocks that caused asset prices to move (Cutler et al. (1989) ). The unique feature of the ongoing events is that the nature of the shock is clear, as well as the temporal structure. Although there is uncertainty about the long-term consequences, it seems reasonable to assume that the short-term economic growth consequences are more severe than the consequences after, say, 5 years. Moreover, the initial decline in the aggregate stock market in the United States, with a small response to short-term dividend prices, suggests that modest shocks to short-term expectations can trigger large and persistent changes in expected excess returns. As such, shocks to near-future dividends appear risky in the eyes of investors, a fact that may help explain the downward-sloping equity term structure and the high returns to firms that produce near-future dividends (Dechow et al., 2004; Gormsen and Lazarus, 2019) .",

The left side of this figure shows the daily volume traded in the market for Euro Stoxx 50 dividend futures. Each contract is for 100 dividend points. The right side of the figure shows the total value of the contracts traded on a given day. Sample is January 1 to May 19, 2020. This table shows the slope coefficient Bn for a regression of GDP growth onto dividend growth at different horizons (n), conditions and sample periods. The baseline coefficient is estimated over the 1985-2019 sample using rolling 2-year growth and only considers observations where realized dividend growth is below the time-series average. Dividend growth is real dividend growth for S&P 500 and GDP growth is real GDP growth in the United States. Heteroscedasticity autocorrelation consistent (HAC) standard errors based on are presented in parentheses. Observations are quarterly.",
