The long-term sequelae of COVID-19 and neurologic syndromes post COVID remain poorly understood. The present study aims to characterize cognitive performance in patients experiencing cognitive symptoms post-COVID infection. Patients evaluated at a post COVID clinic in Northern Israel who endorsed cognitive symptoms were referred for neurologic consultation. The neurologic work-up included detailed medical history, symptom inventory, neurological examination, the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), laboratory tests and brain CT or MRI. Between December 2020 and June 2021, 46 patients were referred for neurological consultation (65% female), mean age 49.5 (19-72 years). On the MoCA test, executive functions, particularly phonemic fluency, and attention, were impaired. In contrast, the total MoCA score, and memory and orientation subscores did not differ from expected ranges. Disease severity, premorbid condition, pulmonary function tests and hypoxia did not contribute to cognitive performance. Cognitive decline may affect otherwise healthy patients post-COVID, independent of disease severity. Our examination identified abnormalities in executive function, attention, and phonemic fluency. These findings occurred despite normal laboratory tests and imaging findings.",

Long-term cognitive complaints are associated with anxiety and depression (Almeria et al. 2020 ). According to a meta-analysis that used the TriNetX electronic data and evaluated 6-month neurological and psychiatric outcomes among 236,379 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 excluding patients with previous diagnosis of dementia, found that the estimated incidence of a neurological or psychiatric diagnosis 6 months following the infection was 34%, with 13% receiving their first such diagnosis. The most frequent manifestations were vascular complications (e.g., intracranial hemorrhage and ischemic stroke), dementia and psychiatric manifestations (e.g., mood disorders and anxiety). Risk was greatest in, but not limited to, patients who had severe COVID-19 or were hospitalized (Groves and Riley 1988; Hopkins et al. 1999; Mikkelsen et al. 2012 ).",

Due to the circumstances of the pandemic, we were not able to enroll a control group and thus are unable to confirm causality. Additionally, the study group was of variable age, background, and disease severity. Due to limitations in the region on normative data, our sample was compared to a group that was dissimilar by ethnic background and age (Goldstein et al. 2018) . Despite these caveats, we found statistically lower scores compared to the normative dataset, suggesting that our participants had substantial cog-nitive deficits in these domains. Our study was performed in a clinical setting. While this strengthens the ecological validity for patients seeking medical care, individuals were referred for diagnostic tests (e.g., imaging, additional laboratory testing) based on clinical indications and not all the individuals received the same tests (e.g., CT, MRI, EEG). Despite this, MRI, CT, EEG were all read to be normal and did not explain the cognitive symptoms.",

Our data suggest that reports of memory symptoms may be due to these deficits, since we did not find poor performance in the memory domain. Our data are consistent with prior reports suggesting that females have increased risk for long-term cognitive disorder following COVID-19 infection. In this study, the cognitive deficits were not predicted by age, premorbid conditions, or the severity of COVID-19 disease. Additional systemized studies are needed to track the real impact and long-term sequelae of COVID-19 infection on brain health and cognitive function.",
