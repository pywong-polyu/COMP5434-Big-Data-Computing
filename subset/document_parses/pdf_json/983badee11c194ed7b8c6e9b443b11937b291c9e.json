A common denial trend that occurs with \"outpatient medical benefit drugs\" is payers not requiring or permitting prior authorization (PA) proactively, yet denying the drug after administration for medical necessity. In this situation, a preemptive strategy of complying with payer-mandated requirements is critical for revenue protection. To address this need, our institution incorporated a medical necessity review into its existing closedloop, pharmacy-managed precertification and denials management program. Summary. Referrals for targeted payers and high-dollar medical benefit drugs not eligible for PA and deemed high risk for denial were incorporated into the review. Payer medical policies were evaluated and clinical documentation assessed to confirm alignment. This descriptive report outlines the medical necessity workflow as a component of the larger precertification process, details the decision-making process when performing the review, and delineates the roles and responsibilities for involved team members. A total of 526 drug orders were evaluated from September 2018 to August 2019, with 146 interventions completed. Of the 761 individual claims affected by proactive medical necessity review, 99.2% resulted in payment and less than 1% resulted in revenue loss, safeguarding more than $5.3 million in annual institutional drug reimbursement. At the time of analysis, there were only 3 cases of revenue loss.",

The logic built into the EHR that drives the referral creation and routing is based on drug class groupers. All drugs added to the formulary are reviewed based on drug class, drug acquisition cost greater than $100, and payer coverage requirements to determine if referral logic should be included in the drug build for outpatient prescribing.",

To accomplish this, the dispensing pharmacy reviews referral authorization status at least 48 hours before the scheduled treatment visit and works with the precertification and clinical teams, if needed, to rush the referral authorization or reschedule the patient visit if the referral is not yet authorized.

In 2017, a growing trend of denials based on failure to establish medical necessity, as well as observation of payers referring to their published policies for coverage guidelines, led to justification of a medical necessity specialist position that was intended for a registered nurse. To avoid delays in program implementation, a per-diem clinical pharmacist was engaged to launch the medical necessity review program, allowing time for recruitment, hiring, and training of the full-time medical necessity specialist. When recruiting for this position, the pharmacy leadership looked for a registered nurse with experience in outpatient specialty areas, patient care coordination, and medication access. Ultimately, an oncology-trained registered nurse with nurse navigator experience was hired. Following the program launch and for 6 months thereafter, the clinical pharmacist served as a double check in the workflow, evaluating drug orders, EHR documentation, clinical resources, and medical policies alongside the medical necessity specialist. Over time, the registered nurse gained experience and transitioned to function more independently, with the clinical pharmacist and the precertification team pharmacist manager assisting with decision-making only for clinically complex cases.",

To reduce the lag time and improve cash flow, the precertification process was modified to request a pre-d for all new, nonurgent drug referrals for this particular payer, resulting in fewer postclaim, prepayment requests for medical records and faster reimbursement. Additionally, the denials team learned that many Medicare Advantage plans were using the local Medicare administrative contractor LCDs or LCAs to determine medical necessity, rather than using their internal payer-specific medical policies. As a result, the medical necessity review process was modified to align with this finding so that, for all Medicare Advantage plans, the LCA and LCD are checked to ensure alignment between diagnosis codes and drug orders. Similarly, when a new LCA with expanded medical necessity criteria took effect in this jurisdiction, the precertification and denials teams collaborated regarding anticipated impact of the new LCA structure on Medicare denials.
