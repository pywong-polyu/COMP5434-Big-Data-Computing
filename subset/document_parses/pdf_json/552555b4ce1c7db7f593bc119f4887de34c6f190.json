The purpose of this article is to describe the neurological manifestations so far reported and their probable pathogenesis. We conducted a literature review on EMBASE, MEDLINE and SCIELO databases using the terms \"COVID-19\", \"COVID\", \"neurological\", \"neurologic\", \"manifestations\", \"implications\", \"Guillain-Barre syndrome\", \"encephalopathy\". A total of 33 articles including clinical series, retrospective studies, and case reports were selected and thoroughly reviewed to describe neurological manifestations of COVID-19. There are several neurological manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection with different clinical presentations, severity, and prevalence. The most critical ones, such as cerebrovascular disease, encephalopathy, and Guillain-Barre syndrome, were less common and usually associated with previous medical history, known risk factors for cerebrovascular disease or advanced age. The main hypotheses for the spread of the virus are through the hematogenous route or the cribriform plate of the ethmoid bone or a disseminated severe immune response by a cytokine storm. The presence of neurological disturbances associated with laboratory tests alterations is an important clue for the physicians to promptly recognize neurological manifestations of SARS-CoV-2.",

Up to writing date of this article, 216 countries have been affected by this pandemic, and accordingly the economic, financial, social, and mental havoc along with severe lockdown measures is of great concern. And the damage in the healthcare, mental, social, educational and economic areas, combined with severe lockdown measures, is a major concern. It has been demonstrated that the virus dissemination is through respiratory droplets, fomites and person-to-person contact. Transmission by stool removal has also been reported in healthcare workers, while taking care of infected patients [1] [2] [3] .",

The first is direct infection of the virus, a mechanism proposed to justify the anosmia and hyposmia of patients [4] . The virus could spread directly through the cribriform blade after penetrating the upper airway, which is also explained by the trans-synaptic spread [5] . The second is hematogenous infection. Several studies have described the role of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), as a functional receptor for SARS-CoV-2. Paniz-Mondolfi et al showed the presence of the virus in neuronal endothelial cells [6, 7] . The sluggish cerebral blood flow allows greater interaction between the virus and neuronal cells. Some pathophysiological mechanisms are still unknown, such as the presence of cerebral hemorrhagic complications in some patients with COVID-19 [6] . Third, cytokine storm syndrome (CSS) is another proposal for SARS-CoV-2 injury to the nervous system. The neurotropism of the virus induces the production of interleukin-6 (IL-6) by glial cells. Thereafter, secondary to the action of neuroinflammatory cytokines, there is a chronic inflammatory and consequently a brain damage. There is also activation of the immune system detected for the presence of CD4 + , justifying the immune-mediated profile of the infection. Based on the aforementioned fact, it is evident that CSS is one of the many pathways used by SARS-CoV-2 to damage the brain indirectly [3, 8] . Figure   1 summarizes the pathophysiological mechanism of nervous system involvement in COVID-19 infection. Table 1 summarizes the neurological manifestations of COV-ID-19 [4, [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] ].",

SARS-CoV-2 is 79% genetically identical to SARS-CoV and 50% to Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) [27] . Both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 use ACE2 as the main functional receptor [28] , while MERS-CoV uses dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4, also known as CD26). Beyond the respiratory symptoms, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can provoke many neurologic conditions [29, 30] ; this matter is emphasized by the presence of viral nucleic acid in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and in a brain autopsy [31] . Table 1 summarizes the most significant neurological manifestations. As a mechanism to reach the CNS, neurotropic viruses like coronaviruses use anterograde and retrograde transport with the assistance of kinesins and dynein motor proteins, through the sensory and motor nerve endings [32] , particularly through the afferent nerve endings of the vagus nerve in lungs [26] . Furthermore, when SARS-CoV-2 causes a gastrointestinal tract infection, it can reach CNS by the enteric and sympathetic afferent nerve [33] .",

This inflammation state leads to hypercoagulopathy, vasculitis and direct immune-mediated damage to nerves and muscles. The related symptoms may be fatigue, hemiplegia, sensory loss, aphasia and ataxia. The third stage could be triggered by an even more severe cytokine storm that compromises the blood brain barrier which eases the infiltration of more inflammatory factors and viral particles into CNS. As a result, it leads to brain damage and injury that may cause delirium, encephalopathy, and/or seizures. In addition, the virus binds to the ACE2 receptor increasing peripheral vascular resistance causing hypertension which increases the risk of intracranial hemorrhage [34] . Figure 2 summarizes this physiopathological mechanism of neurological involvement.",

The most accepted one is that the coagulopathy is induced by the systemic inflammatory response and this theory is reinforced by finding high level of D-dimer and CRP levels in most cases. In addition, antiphospholipid antibodies (aPLs) were detected in three patients [38] . Another theory would be the depletion of ACE2 and endothelial dysfunction. The ACE2 is expressed in lung, endothelial cells, glial cells and neurons. It acts by protecting the brain and other organs from ischemia as it disables the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system by cleaving angiotensin-II to angiotensin or to angiotensin-I that is also converted in angiotensin. Angiotensin induces vasodilatation and has anti-inflammatory effects. As SARS-CoV-2 enters the cell, it depletes ACE2 through receptor endocytosis while ACE-1 that activates the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system is unopposed [39] . The treatment measures were mechanical thrombectomy and thrombolysis [19, 22] . Platelet anti-aggregant and statins were also used.",

There is a case report of a 78-year-old woman with a previous history of a herpetic encephalopathy 2 years ago with no seizure episodes since then. In this case the focal status epilepticus was the only manifestation of the SARS-CoV-2 infection [24] . In 2004, a case of a 32-year-old pregnant woman who had COVID infection was reported. She had tonic-colonic convulsion and the PCR exam of the CSF was positive for SARS-CoV [43] . As both viruses are very similar taxonomically, it is important to relate this report.",

The authors noticed that patients with muscular symptoms showed higher creatine kinase and lactate dehydrogenase levels compared with patients without these symptoms. The muscle injury may occur due to infection-mediated harmful immune response, elevated proinflammatory cytokines or the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 and the ACE2 in the skeletal muscle [4] .",

The most critical ones, such as cerebrovascular disease, encephalopathy, GBS, were less common and usually associated with previous medical history illness, vascular disease risk factors, or advanced age. The mechanisms of neurological implications are not well determined yet. The main hypotheses are: 1) The spread of the virus through hematogenous route; 2) The cribriform lamina of the ethmoid bone; and 3) Disseminated severe immune response by cytokine storm. The presence of neurological disturbances associated with lab exams' alterations is an important clue for doctors to identify SARS-CoV-2 infection, promote social isolation, and offer adequate support.",
