Whether human-induced (e.g., the World Trade Center attacks), natural (e.g., hurricanes), or technological (e.g., Chernobyl nuclear reactor accident), disasters are accompanied by an increase in a wide scale of mental and behavioral disorders (1) . Pandemics specifically can lead to increased levels of anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress (2, 3) . The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is a major game changer in the life of many individuals across the world. Important direct consequences that highly affect social life are regulations imposed by governments, such as closing schools, and leisure and sports facilities, and obligating social distancing in the public space. During COVID-19, increased rates of anxiety and depression, and decreased psychological wellbeing have been reported in the adult general population (4) , and adult psychiatric patients show worsening of their symptoms (5) .",

Growing up in a single-parent family, having more than three children in the family, a negative change in parental work situation due to COVID-19 regulations, and having a friend or relative infected with COVID-19 were factors associated with more mental and social health problems during the COVID-19 lockdown.",

For instance, the level of psychopathology, degree of stressful events, gender, and school attendance are associated with psychosocial functioning (15, 16) . Therefore, it is important to examine mental and social health during the COVID-19 lockdown in which many of these factors are involved (17, 18) . Also, psychosocial problems may arise or worsen because of the disruption of (mental) support programs due to COVID-19 regulations (19) . In addition, treatments of children and their families suddenly transitioned from in-person therapy to online therapy, which may in some cases affect the quality of their treatment (20) .

Another study in a neuropsychiatric child and adolescent sample reported increases in obsessive-compulsive problems, post-traumatic stress, and thought problems (22) . On the other hand, a French study investigated the well-being of 533 children and adolescents with self-reported Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) during the COVID-19 pandemic (23) . As reported by their parents, 65.3% of these children showed no changes in well-being or were doing better than before the pandemic, suggesting that more than half of the children and adolescents with ADHD experience stability or improvement of their well-being during the COVID-19 lockdown. Still, one third of children reported lower well-being, indicating substantial variation in responses. Similarly, anecdotal evidence from child and adolescent clinical practice suggested that for some children and families, COVID-19 lockdowninduced changes reduced sensory exposure and daily stress (e.g., school related stress), and subsequently seemed to reduce mental problems and even improved well-being in some children, while for other children negative outcomes (e.g., increased stress levels, reduced well-being and mental health) are to be expected (24) .",

Additionally, adolescents with cystic fibrosis reported lower anxiety levels during the COVID-19 pandemic compared to their healthy peers (26) . These studies suggest that children with a (chronic) somatic condition, despite their vulnerability, may be less susceptible to negative consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, a recent study in a large Hongkong population (N 29,202 families) showed that children with chronic diseases and children with parents reporting mental problems scored higher on emotional and behavioral problems, and decreased peer relations (27) .

(28), CAT V2.0-Peer Relationships (e.g., I could talk with my friends) (29) , CAT V2.0-Anxiety (e.g., I worried about what could happen to me) (30), CAT V2.0-Depressive Symptoms (e.g., I felt sad) (30), Scale V2.0-Anger (e.g., I was so angry I felt like throwing something) (31) , and CAT V1.0-Sleeprelated Impairment (e.g., I was sleepy during the daytime) (32) . These measures have been selected by the American Psychiatric Association (APA) as level-2 assessment measures for monitoring and evaluating psychiatric disorders from the DSM-V. The psychometric properties of the PROMIS measures are adequate. Previous studies have shown that the instruments provide reliable measurements at the mean of the population and at least two standard deviations in clinically relevant direction (28) (29) (30) (31) (32) . PROMIS measures use a 7-days recall period and items are scored on a five-point Likert scale. All items range from \"never\" to \"(almost) always\", except for Global Health, where response categories differ for each item (e.g., \"excellent\" to \"poor\"). Total scores are calculated by transforming item scores into a T-score ranging from 0 to 100, with a mean of 50 and a standard deviation of 10 in the U.S. general population (for our purposes, we compared to representative Dutch data; see data analysis). For all measures, higher scores represent more of the construct. For Anger (nine items) and Global Health (7+2 items) we used the total scales. For the other item banks, we used Computerized Adaptive Testing (CAT), in which items are presented based on the responses to previously administered items. This results in a reliable total score while administering fewer items than regular questionnaires (33) .",

Mental and social health were worst for children with pre-existing psychiatric problems, whereas children from the pediatric sample showed the most favorable results. As expected, children with pre-existing psychiatric problems showed most problems in mental and social health. The closing of schools and other services during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown likely affects this group of children especially since these are places where vulnerable children often seek help first (39) .

Additionally, people may have felt that mental problems are less important when the overall medical system is under high pressure because of COVID-19. Personal contact often changed to online therapy, of which the effects have not yet been tested thoroughly (40) . Although online therapy can be an effective treatment, during the pandemic online therapy is sometimes provided out of necessity rather than choice. In addition, online therapy might increase the risk of losing contact with particular vulnerable families (20) . Furthermore, existing feelings of anxiety might increase in response to the threat of close relatives being infected with COVID-19 or becoming infected oneself. The finding that children with pre-existing problems living in the north of the Netherlands showed the least anxiety problems might hint to this, since in that part of the country almost no reported COVID-19 cases were present at the time. Still, these interpretations are made with caution since based on the current data we cannot conclude that the COVID-19 lockdown plays a significant role in the higher levels of mental and social problems in the psychiatric population. The only data that clearly hint at this notion derive from the qualitative part of our study showing that only children from the psychiatric sample indicated that the (continually changing) COVID-19-measures made them angry, sad, or insecure. In contrast to the psychiatric sample, children, and adolescents from the pediatric sample showed the least problems on all mental and social health scales. As this population generally suffers from more psychosocial problems than the general population (11, 12) , this suggests they are least negatively affected by the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown regulations. A possible explanation for this finding may be that these children are more often confronted with stressful events that directly affect their physical health and restraints in daily life due to the management of their disease. As a result, children may have developed more adaptive coping strategies (25, 26) . In addition, one could speculate that the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown induced changes in daily life might be less invasive for some of these children as home schooling and carefully taking care of one's physical health may be part of life already (25) . Likewise, they may be more used to having online contact with friends, which may explain their higher reported Peer Relationships.",

In our sample of children and adolescents with pre-existing somatic problems, we only found a small negative effect of a parent having a friend or relative infected with COVID-19 on the child's peer relations. It is possible that these vulnerable children are less affected by such situations because they are more accustomed to dealing with stressful events and thereby have become more resilient to them. Since the qualitative part of this study suggested that the COVID-19-restrictions itself do affect mental health in the psychiatric population, it is important to examine additional COVID-19 related measures in the future.",

In particular, the pediatric sample was relatively small. Additionally, due to the cross-sectional design of this study, we cannot assess what factors have impacted on the change in mental and social health of children and adolescents due to the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown. Finally, there may be individual differences in how children respond to the lockdown. The literature so far hints at a potential diverse range of effects that the COVID-19 pandemic has on children and adolescents with pre-existing vulnerabilities, ranging from an increase in mental health problems to reduction of stress, loss of social pressure, and improved well-being (24) . For future research, we recommend studying this variability more in depth.",
