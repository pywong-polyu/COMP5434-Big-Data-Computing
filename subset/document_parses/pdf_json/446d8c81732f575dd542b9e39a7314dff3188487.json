The emergence of safe and effective vaccines provides a route out of the pandemic, with vaccination uptake of 75-90% needed to achieve population protection. Vaccine hesitancy is problematic for vaccine rollout; global reports suggest only 73% of the population may agree to being vaccinated. As a result, there is an urgent need to develop equitable and accessible interventions to address vaccine hesitancy at the population level.",

Guided by motivational interviewing (MI) principles, the intervention includes a series of therapeutic dialogues addressing 10 key concerns of vaccine hesitant individuals. Development of the intervention occurred linearly across four stages. During stage 1, we identified common reasons for COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy through analysis of existing survey data, a rapid systematic literature review, and public engagement workshops. Stage 2 comprised qualitative interviews with medical, immunological, and public health experts. Rapid content and thematic analysis of the data provided evidence-based responses to common vaccine concerns. Stage 3 involved the development of therapeutic dialogues through workshops with psychological and digital behaviour change experts. Dialogues were developed to address concerns using MI principles, including embracing resistance and supporting self-efficacy.",

First, key themes identified in the expert interviews (Stage 2) were discussed and translated into conversational language. The investigators chose a conversational approach to align with the online delivery format and to ensure inclusivity for all reading/English levels (see stage 4 below). Second, the dialogues were reviewed to identify points at which MI techniques could be integrated throughout. This process drew on contributors' experience in behaviour change research and adopted the approach proposed by Rollnick and colleagues [26] . This included expressing empathy through use of accepting and non-judgemental language. Developing discrepancy by simultaneously providing information related to the concern, and presenting a rationale for vaccine uptake. The latter were derived from survey respondents willing to accept a COVID-19 vaccine (see Table 1b ) and sought to develop a discrepancy between the individual's cause for concern and their wider personal values and goals. Embracing resistance by acknowledging that their concerns are shared by others and are legitimate and supporting self-efficacy by reinforcing the individual's personal agency in making their decision to accept a vaccine or not. See Table 4 for illustrative examples of how MI principles were embedded within the therapeutic dialogues. Finally, we hosted a PPI workshop to discuss the resulting dialogues. The group, while small (n=4), included two adults less than 30 years (two greater than 50 years); three women and one man and all reported an interest in vaccine hesitancy and had some experiences of it in friends and family. The feedback obtained through this workshop fostered changes to their readability, along with expansion of the information conveyed and greater consideration of specific groups within the population (i.e. those who have allergies or specific religious and cultural needs). No additional vaccine concerns were identified by the group.",

[32] The implications of these inconsistencies for the quality and validity of these reviews is, however, unclear as there is thus far limited evidence comparing the results of different review approaches. The provision of such evidence in future research would undoubtedly inform the contexts in which it is appropriate to conduct rapid reviews, and the methods that should be employed. Such guidance now exists for scoping reviews [33] and would appear to be in development for rapid reviews by the Equator network.",
