Previous studies showed that the prophylactic character of vaccines, the multiplicity of epitopes to which the immune system responds within a host, and their diversity between hosts delay the evolution and emergence of escape mutants in a vaccinated population. By extending previous mathematical models, we find that, depending on the cost of the escape mutations, there even exist critical levels of immune response diversity that completely prevent vaccine escape. Furthermore, to quantify the potential for vaccine escape below these critical levels, we propose a concept of escape depth which measures the fraction of escape mutants that can spread in a vaccinated population. Determining this escape depth for a vaccine could help to predict its sustainability in the face of pathogen evolution.",

Vaccines, in contrast to drug treatment, work prophylactically, which reduces the probability that an escape mutant emerges by de novo mutation compared to drug treatment [1] .

The diversity of immune responses appears on two levels: the various epitopes to which the immune system responds within a vaccinated individual and the diversity of these epitopes between individuals. An epitope is the part of a antigen to which an antibody attaches, often, a single mutation in the epitope can confer escape from specific antibodies [8] , [9] . The diversity in epitopes can be observed by studying antibody repertoires elicited by individuals upon vaccination, which recently became possible due to novel bioinformatical and statistical methods [10] . Such studies have shown that the antibody repertoires elicited after a tetanus vaccination, that exists of up to 100 clones [1] , [11] , barely overlap between individuals [1] , [12] . Similarly, in a study of a pneumococcal polysacharide vaccination, all four donors elicited an antibody repertoire with an unique fingerprint [13] . Besides being based on factors such as age [14] , [15] , sex [16] and genetic background [17] - [19] , twin studies have shown that this diversity is partly stochastic [20] , [21] .",

These escape mutants contain one or multiple mutations in epitopes which allow them to escape the immune response an individual elicits against these epitopes. To capture the complex dynamics of the wild-type and multiple escape strains, we propose a new concept: the escape depth, which we define as the fraction of possible escape mutants that can spread in a vaccinated population.

In our model, a vaccinated individual elicits an immune response against epitopes selected from a larger set that represents the total diversity in targeted epitopes. Each unique combination of responses against epitopes is referred to as a vaccination-type (see Figure 1 ). Pathogen mutants can escape the response against an epitope by a single mutation in this epitope. The cost of such an escape mutation is modelled by a decrease in the transmission rate of the mutant. To be precise, the transmission rate decreases with 10% for each additional mutation. Similar to the original McLean model, we assume that all possible escape mutants are present in the population at low levels before vaccination starts. Also, we assume that the vaccine has an efficacy of only 20% for preventing infection with an escape mutant. Figure 2 shows the dynamics of the model for a single immune response per individual and either two or eight different responses between individuals (vaccination-types). This Figure illustrates what has been described by Kennedy and Read before: increasing the diversity in immune responses upon vaccination delays the expected rise of escape mutants.

Figure 4A and B show that the reproduction numbers of the escape mutants decrease for increasing betweenhost diversity of immune-responses with only one response within individuals. The basic reproduction number is shown for up to 70 vaccination types, where the endemic reproduction is limited to 11 vaccination types due to computational limitations. To simplify the interpretation of the many reproduction numbers shown in Figure 4A and B, we introduced the concept of escape depth. The escape depth is defined as the fraction of possible escape mutants that has a reproduction number above 1 and could thus spread in the vaccinated population (see Figure 4C and D). With an escape depth of 1 each possible mutant could spread, whereas an escape depth of 0 indicates that none of the mutants could spread. This last case would imply that the vaccine is completely evolution-proof (in our model only). The continuous scale between these two extremes helps to quantify and compare the evolutionary sustainability of vaccines. Figure escape depth of the model decreases with an increase of the number of vaccination types. Starting from 37 vaccination types, the escape depth based on the basic reproduction number is even zero, meaning that the vaccine can not be escaped for these levels of between-host diversity.",

However, it is known that a single host can respond against multiple antigens and epitopes of a pathogen [11] , [12] . In a next step, we therefore consider vaccines that induce the same immune response in different individuals, but multiple responses within them. We assume that a mutant can only escape such an immune response fully if it has a mutation in each epitope, against which the vaccination-type responds, and partial escape mutants are as susceptible to the immune response as the wild-type while still carrying a transmission cost. Figure 6A shows how the basic reproduction number changes for an increasing number of within-host immune responses. We find that the basic reproduction number of partial escapes are unaffected by number of within-host epitopes. However, the basic reproduction number of the full escape mutant decreases when the number of within-host epitopes increases. This is due to the increased cost of the full escape mutant which is larger when the vaccine elicits more immune responses within a host. Additionally, we tested the relative contribution of the within-host multiplicity of immune responses and the between-host diversity in preventing the spread of escape mutants. To this end, we construct three scenarios that cover the conceivable range of possibilities from extremely low to very high within-host multiplicity, while keeping the between-host diversity constant at 120 vaccination types. We then compare the escape depth in these three scenarios 6B).",

First, the vaccine against Hepatitus B Virus (HBV) elicits immune responses against one epitope and a single mutation confers vaccination escape [27] , [28] . As a result, vaccine escape mutants evolved shortly after the introduction of the vaccine [29] . Second, escape mutants of Yersinia Ruckeri, that causes Enteric redmouth disease (ERD) in fish, emerged after the introduction of a first monovalent vaccine [30] - [32] . This escape can be caused by four different single mutations which all effect the same pathway [1] , [31] . On the other hand, one of the best-known examples of vaccination escape, Marek's Disease Virus (MDV), which causes a viral infection in chicken [33] , is not well described by our model. This is because the MDV strain used as a live vaccine, rather than inducing protective immune responses, works by occupying the target cell niche of the pathogenic MDV strain [34] . As a consequence, escaping from the MDV vaccine can be accomplished, not by avoiding the detection by immune responses, but by increasing the competitive ability against the vaccine strain [35] .",

With the present paper, we are contributing to this growing body of work by not only investigating the impact of immune diversity on the potential to delay the spread of escape mutants, but to prevent their spread altogether. Most crucial for the potential spread of escape mutants are their fitness costs. Thus, determining the diversity of vaccine-induced immune responses within individuals and the population, as well as the costs of escape mutations could allow us to better predict the sustainability of vaccines in the face of pathogen evolution.",

Our model is an extension of McLean's (1995) model [22] . The model starts with a susceptible, non-vaccinated population (S). A wild-type infectious pathogen can infect the susceptible population with transmission rate \u03b2. Individuals infected with the wild-type are indicated with I w . After twenty years, a vaccination program starts and 80 percent of the newborns are vaccinated with a vaccine that has an efficacy of 95 percent for the wild-type pathogen. There is also an escape mutant present in the system, for which the vaccine is only 20 percent efficient. Individuals infected with either type of pathogen who recover are immune to both pathogen types for the rest of the simulation.",

As indicated in Figure 1 , each individual can elicit an immune response against a variety epitopes and each unique combination of immune responses against epitopes forms a vaccination-type. Figure 7 represents a model where six vaccination-types are possible. We assume that all immune responses against epitopes are equally distributed over the population. Besides the wild-type pathogen, there are also various escape mutants around. Each escape mutant contains a mutation in one ore multiple of the epitopes the immune system can recognize. In Figure 7 , compartment I represents individuals that are infected with the wild-type or one of the escape mutants. All possible escape mutants exist before vaccination starts. The death rate of vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals is equal, as well as the rate at which individuals leave any of the infected compartments. The advantage of escaping any of the immune responses against epitopes comes at a cost. Therefore, we let the transmission rate at which a mutant can spread decay with 10 percent for each mutation. The full system of ODE equations that describes this model can be found in the Supplementary material, as well as a table with a description and the value of all model parameters.",

Therefore, we analyse the model to find analytical expressions as well as numerical values for the reproduction number of each escape mutant. We do this for both the reproduction number in a fully naive population, so without any other escape mutants around (the basic reproduction number R 0 ), and in a situation where all other escape mutants that have less escape mutations where already able to spread (the endemic reproduction number R e ). The general equation for both reproduction numbers is shown in Figure 3 and is a combination of the transmission rate of the pathogen type (\u03b2), the duration of the infectious period ( 1 \u03b4 ) and the number of individuals that can be infected by this pathogen type. For the basic reproduction number, this number of individuals is calculated using the disease free equilibria for the number of vaccinated and non-vaccinated susceptibles:S = (1\u2212p)\u039b \u00b5 andV = p\u039b \u00b5 . For the endemic reproduction number of each pathogen type, we used the equilibria values of the number of non-vaccinated and vaccinated individuals in a system where all other pathogen types with less mutations have already spread.
