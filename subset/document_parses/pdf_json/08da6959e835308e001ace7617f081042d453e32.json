Some patients who could have received the same treatment in their residential areas still choose to receive services in areas with higher economic development and concentrated high-quality medical resources, resulting in a huge waste of medical resources. Blindly increasing medical resources everywhere does not necessarily increase the output effectively. In this study, the data envelopment analysis (DEA) model, social network analysis (SNA), cluster analysis, and regression analysis are used to analyze the structural characteristics of the economic network structure and efficiency of health care in China. The results show that indegree and eigenvector centrality have a significant positive correlation with the efficiency of health care, and the clustering coefficient has a significant negative correlation with the efficiency of health care in China. This study uses a k-means algorithm to classify 31 provinces into three groups and extract their characteristics. As for the supply of health care resources, the government should command and dispatch the resources in the whole country through a top-down design based on the characteristics of each province.",

At present, China has elevated health to an important position in its strategic development toward the policy of \"Healthy China, \" which paid a lot of attention to public fitness, food safety, environmental pollution, and public health emergencies. The medical and health services of China have developed rapidly (1) . Although government investment continues to increase in medical service, and health service supply capacity and the level of the quantity received a significant boost, the medical and health care of China still faces problems, such as imbalanced levels of regional medical development and low efficiency of health care.",

It helps severely ill people to shorten the recovery time and return to work (2), thus improving the overall labor efficiency and achieving the purpose of promoting sustainable economic development. However, excessive medical service input and rapid increase in medical service fee standards have led to the national cost crisis. Problems such as the rapid increase in health care costs (as Japan faced in the past) and severe government fiscal deficits also exist. Therefore, blind investment in limited medical resources is uneconomical. Many scholars also believe that medical and health expenditures can be greatly reduced, although better schemes to reduce costs have not been deduced yet (3) . Owing to the large span of the regions of China, poor economic interaction between regions, lack of resource information sharing, backward diffusion of scientific and technological achievements, and other obstacles, the economic development gap between the regions of China is widening with each passing day. The unbalanced development of the regional economy of China actuates the \"inverse care law\" of medical and health services, which is mainly manifested as the relatively small distribution of medical resources in poor areas and poor geographical accessibility of medical services owing to the large urban-rural and regional differences. There is an inverse correlation between quality medical and health services and the health needs of people, indicating that people in poor areas have higher health needs (4) . Therefore, it is of vital importance to rationally allocate national medical resources according to the economic connections between provinces, and to improve the quality and efficiency of health care in underdeveloped areas to meet the health needs to the maximum extent.",

Investment in health resources will reduce the increasing mortality rate, control infectious diseases, and improve the health of mothers and children (5) . There is a negative correlation between health resources and mortality (6, 7) ; medical advances can extend life spans (8) and more directly and quickly meet individual medical needs (9) . In the 1990s, Sherman (10) first applied DEA in the field of health care to evaluate whether resources are effectively utilized by relative efficiency. Scholars have extensively applied the DEA model to the medical and health system and researched the efficiency of hospitals in a variety of ways. Nayar et al. (11) evaluated the efficiency differences of different types of hospitals. Hamidi (12) collected the balanced panel data of government hospitals over 6 years and used the stochastic frontier approach (SFA) model to measure the technical efficiency of government hospitals through the input variables of beds, doctors, nurses, and non-medical personnel in the hospital and the output variables of the total number of inpatients and outpatients. Li et al. (13) collected the relevant data of 12 county-level public hospitals in Anhui Province, China, from 2010 to 2015. The results showed that the technical efficiency of county-level hospitals in China was low, and the surplus medical resources in poor areas were much higher than those in non-poor areas. The overall operating efficiency of hospitals in poor areas was very low, and regional economic differences affected the performance of hospitals. Jiang et al. (14) used the DEA model to calculate the efficiency of 1,105 sample hospitals in 31 provinces of China and confirmed the health care efficiency in China was relatively low, with the highest efficiency in Eastern China and the lowest in Western China. Owing to the emphasis on the construction of large urban hospitals and the neglect of basic medical service institutions, and on account of the blind pursuit of interests by hospitals and excessive expansion of hospital scale, the current medical resource use efficiency of China is not high and there is a lot of wastage. To sum up, the DEA model is widely used in medical and health systems in related studies.",

            "text": "Many previous studies have focused on the relationship between economy and medical resource allocation. Economic crisis can lead to an increase in the unemployment rate and a decrease in medical resources (15) . Moreover, a poor economy reduces the input of government fiscal revenue to public health and the poor population has less access to health resources. From an international viewpoint, with the improvement of national economic development, the expenditure on medical and health will also increase (16) , and there is a long-term equilibrium relationship between the two. The developed regions of China have strengthened the less-developed regions through longterm cooperation and transformation, which include support for health technicians, equipment maintenance, and funding. Local governments have reinforced regional health planning, including the integration, and sharing of medical resources among regions while focusing on weak links such as investment in rural and community health resources. Based on the actual conditions, all localities should improve the medical system while achieving all-round development and gradually implement and improve the allocation of health resources nationwide. The measures to further meet the health service needs of local people include increasing the total number of health personnel, evaluating their service quality, and optimizing the allocation of health personnel resources in areas with low economic development (17) . The problem of insufficient reserves of conventional medical resources becomes exposed after the outbreak of public health emergencies and can be resolved only through the \"reconfiguration\" of medical resources. SNA involves studying social relationships and structures, focusing on the internal networks between different social actors (18) . Developed in the 1930s, SNA is used to analyze the relationships between people. It has developed rapidly and combined with mathematics, statistics, computer science, and other disciplines to become an interdisciplinary analytical method. It is mainly composed of points and lines. It describes the interactive structural relations between individuals through quantitative indicators and reflects the characteristics of the entire network structure and the position of individual objects in the network structure. The structure in this study could be behavioral structure, political structure, social structure, or economic structure. The regional economy is open; any region can have an economic connection and economic penetration with other regions through the flow of resource elements, such as population, materials, capital, technology, and flow of information through economic agglomeration and spillover. Therefore, it is of great significance to use SNA to quantify the economic conditions and test the effect of structural characteristics of economic networks on the efficiency of health care in China. In the age of big data, the statistical method in exploratory data analysis such as cluster analysis is often used to discriminate objects by similarity or difference. Since the introduction of k-means, due to its effectiveness, simplicity, and speed in data analysis, the k-means algorithm has been widely used in various fields, resulting in different management practices. Based on the result of DEA and SNA analysis, this study uses cluster analysis to expand the depth of the research and puts forward targeted suggestions accordingly.",
