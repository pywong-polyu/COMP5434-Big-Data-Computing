It has been hypothesized that the SARS-CoV-2 virus may induce injury in the central and peripheral nervous system [7] and that this may have an impact on sensory and motor functions related to swallowing [8, 9] . Furthermore, critical illness as a consequence of prolonged intensive care, intubation, tracheostomy, and respiratory failure may also impose negative effects on deglutition and laryngeal function in this patient group [8, 10] . Previous studies on post-extubation dysphagia in the ICU varies greatly between 3 and 84% depending on the methodology [11, 12] . A study on mechanically ventilated patients in the ICU with no prior history of dysphagia performed a fiberendoscopic evaluation of swallowing (FEES) post extubation demonstrated the presence of penetration and aspiration in 36% and 22% of patients, respectively [13] .",

About half of the patients had residue in the vallecula equal to or over grade 3 of 5 according to the Yale Pharyngeal Residue Severity Scale on at least one of the examinations. Slightly fewer had residue of the same degree in the pyriform sinuses. Residue was more common in the vallecula than in the hypopharynx after boluses with puree consistency. Residue in the larynx and hypopharynx after swallowing a small bolus of mildly thick liquid in a patient with severe dysphagia is displayed in Fig 3D. Twenty-two of 25 patients had enteral nutrition through a nasogastric tube at the time of the first FEES examination. After the swallowing examination, all patients were given at least minimal oral intake as an attempt to regain and preserve swallowing function. Thirteen of 15 patients with serial FEES examinations improved between the first and last FEES (median 11 days; mean 16 days; range 4 to 42 days) and could increase the oral intake. Eight patients could return to full oral nutrition with restrictions and one patient to total oral intake without restrictions. In two patients no improvement was seen, one of whom subsequently received a percutaneous endoscopic gastrotomy tube (PEG) for feeding. Fourteen of 15 patients with several FEES examinations had still some degree of dysphagia at the time of the last FEES. The last FEES examination was often in connection with discharge from the hospital. The majority of patients had some level of tachypnea during or in connection to the examination. Nineteen of 23 patients (83%) had a respiratory rate over 20 breaths per minute. Of these 19 patients, four had a respiratory rate over 25 and another four a respiratory rate over 30 breaths per minute. Table 1 ). Residue after swallow is evaluated with the Yale Pharyngeal Residue Severity Scale (grade 1 = no residue, grade 5 = filled to the epiglottic rim or to the aryepiglottic folds, respectively; see Table 1 ). Dotted red filling represents patients in whom the boluses were considered unsafe and not given due to high risk for aspiration. Grey filling indicates the proportion of patients who did not receive the particular bolus for other reasons. NA denotes that the rating was not possible to perform due to insufficient visibility on the video. Ratings of secretion were made according to the Murray Secretion Scale (\"normal\" refers to grade 1, no secretion, \"mild\" to grade 2, deeply pooled secretions, \"moderate\" to grade 3, transient pooling in the larynx, and \"severe\" to grade 4, secretions in the laryngeal vestibule). Ratings of recommendations of oral intake were made according to the Functional Oral Intake Scale (FOIS) (\"normal\" refers to grade 7, total oral intake without restriction, \"mild\" to grade 5-6, total oral intake with restrictions, \"moderate\" to grad 3-4, total oral intake with a single consistency or consistent oral intake with tube supplements, and \"severe\" to grade 1-2, tube dependent with no/minimal/inconsistent oral intake).",

In particular, the total time in hospital and days in the ICU appeared to correlate with the severity of dysphagia. The number of days on mechanical ventilation and days with tracheostomy correlated to a lesser degree to ratings of swallowing function. Ratings of vocal fold erythema correlated inversely with total hospital time and arytenoid edema inversely with tracheostomy time. Thus, shorter time in hospital was associated with higher ratings of vocal fold erythema and shorter duration with tracheostomy with more prominent edema in the arytenoid region. There was no correlation between the number of days with endotracheal intubation and swallowing and abnormal laryngeal findings. The post-hoc analysis indicates that there was a significant difference between patients with different ratings of pooling of secretions in relation to the total time in hospital (rho = 0.52, p = 0.008; Kruskal-Wallis H = 8.16, p = 0.043; n = 25) and the number of days in the ICU (rho = 0.58, p = 0.002; Kruskal-Wallis H = 10.47, p = 0.015; n = 25), i.e., more severe ratings of secretion were associated with a longer total time in hospital and in the ICU (Fig 4) .

To the authors' knowledge, this is the first study to evaluate the swallowing function in COVID-19 patients using FEES. A high prevalence of dysphagia and abnormal laryngeal findings was identified in this series of 25 patients with severe COVID-19 treated in the ICU. All but one had dysphagia to some degree at the time of the FEES either during the later stage of ICU care or after discharge from the ICU. In particular, pooling of secretions in the hypopharynx and residue in the vallecula and pyriform sinuses after swallowing were prevalent. Penetration to the larynx and/or aspiration to the trachea occurred in several patients but was somewhat less frequent. Silent aspiration to the trachea was seen on at least one occasion in 44% of patients. Impaired vocal fold movement, vocal fold erythema, and arytenoid edema were common.",

Among these risk factors are laryngeal injury caused by the tube during intubation or tracheostomy, neuromuscular weakness, decreased oropharyngeal and laryngeal sensation, impaired cognition and reduced consciousness, impaired coordination between swallowing and breathing, and gastroesophageal reflux. Several factors often occur together [13, 27] . Similar risk factors for COVID-19 patients in the ICU has previously been assumed [28] . Impaired swallowing function in tracheostomized patients could be a result of loss of sensation in the pharynx due to a cuffed tube and/or loss of subglottic pressure with an open tube [29, 30] . Poor coughing ability is seen in both these circumstances, affecting the ability to protect the airway from aspiration.",

A probable cause for this could be neuromuscular weakness due to long stay in the ICU. Patients with severe pulmonary diseases often exhibit impaired coordination between breathing and swallowing [29] . It can therefore be assumed that COVID-19 patients who suffer from acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) are likely to develop difficulties with breathing-swallowing coordination. Furthermore, most patients were tachypnoeic during the examinations in this study, and it is feasible to assume that a high respiratory rate contributes to difficulties with the coordination between swallowing and breathing. Penetration and aspiration were frequent and probable causes are neuromuscular weakness, injuries in larynx or hypopharynx caused by the endotracheal tube or heavy reflux, discoordination of swallowing and breathing, and poor sensation in the larynx and pharynx [31] . The high incidence of silent aspiration may be due to poor sensation, which can be suspected in many patients. Impaired cognition and awareness were common in these patients and probably had an impact on swallowing function, as seen in previous studies [32, 33] .",

FEES is preferred due to the high incidence of secretion pooling, silent aspiration and residuals. FEES can also be used as a tool to guide decisions for safe decannulation in tracheostomized patients [42] . When discharged from the hospital a large proportion of patients still had some degree of difficulties swallowing and would benefit from a routine follow-up. Impaired vocal fold movement was found in 76%, and vocal fold erythema and arytenoid edema in 60%, respectively, of this patient group. It is not possible to draw any conclusion from the data in the present study regarding whether this primarily is a consequence of the ICU treatment or related to the COVID-19 infection. Data on laryngeal function after treatment of COVID-19 in the ICU is limited so far. Rouhani et al. [43] reported of findings two months after post-hospital discharge on voice, swallow, and airway outcomes following tracheostomy for COVID-19. Forty-one patients with an average duration of endotracheal intubation of 24 days were included. Eighty-one percent of these patients had normal endoscopic examination of the larynx. Evidence of fixed upper airway obstruction was noted in 22%. More than 50% still had dysphonia after two months, most of them to a mild degree. Signs of laryngeal injury may thus appear to decrease over time in a majority of patients, but adverse effects on the larynx will remain in some. More studies are needed in this regard.",

            "text": "Data from previous studies indicate that laryngeal injury is common after care in the ICU. In a systematic review of the literature Brodsky et al. [44] noted a prevalence of 83% of laryngeal injury after endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation across nine included studies. The mean time of intubation was eight days. The laryngeal examination was performed within 72 hours after extubation in most studies. Different signs of laryngeal injury were reported. Vocal fold immobility to some degree was present in 21%, vocal fold erythema in 82%, and arytenoid edema in 71% of the total sample of patients. Other findings were vocal fold edema in 70%, granuloma in 31%, and ulceration in 27%. The data in our study suggest that impaired vocal fold movement may be more frequent among patients treated in the ICU due to severe COVID-19 infection, than in the general ICU patient population. The decreased glottal movement may either be caused by arytenoid dislocation after endotracheal intubation [45] , or to stiffness of the cricoarytenoid joints due to inflammation secondary to long-term intubation or to the COVID-19 infection. Xu et al. [45] also found evidence of neuromuscular damage in some patients with vocal fold immobility after intubation using laryngeal electromyography.",

We have no clear explanation to this somewhat paradoxical finding. It may be that a longer period with tracheostomy reduces the abrasion of the larynx or this may be a coincidental finding. The prevalence of laryngeal injury in ICU patients seems to be related to the duration of endotracheal intubation [44] . In the present study, however, there was no correlation between the number of days with intubation and aberrant laryngeal findings.",

Expiratory glottal narrowing can be found in, for example, individuals with asthma [46] and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) [47] . A slight glottal narrowing during expiration is also seen in some healthy individuals during breathing at rest [48] . There appear to be a coupling between the pattern of glottic movement and the respiratory pattern [49] . For example, glottal adduction is enhanced during loaded expiration [50] . The majority of patients in our study had some degree of tachypnea. The active expiratory movement of the vocal folds may be related to an increased respiratory workload due to respiratory insufficiency. It may also be a means to increase the intrinsic post end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), as has been proposed for COPD [47] . Further studies are needed to clarify this.",

All patients were referred on initiative of the ICU/ward and it is likely that the patients who were referred were the ones with greatest difficulties.
