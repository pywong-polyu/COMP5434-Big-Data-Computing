Currently, the situation in many countries such as South Korea, Italy, and Iran is critical. The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever and cough. 2 In severe cases, the infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure, and even death. The mortality in the elderly (ie, over 65 years old) with underlying diseases is high. The coronaviruses belong to a new RNA virus strain from the Coronaviridae family, 3 and SARS-CoV-2 is the seventh member of the coronavirus family that infects humans. 4 At present, there are no effective antiviral drugs confirmed for treating  and symptomatic support and comprehensive intervention are the main treatment methods. However, treatment with the traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) and the combination of TCM and Western medicine have produced satisfactory therapeutic effects in China and Vellingiri et al also suggested that traditional Indian medicinal plants may be a novel treatment for COVID-19. 5 Lu reviewed the possible treatments for COVID-19, and stated the safety and effectiveness of such treatments remain to be confirmed. 6 Additionally, Iyer et al have reviewed efficient diagnostics, and therapeutic approaches for COVID-19. 7 In medical research, clinical trials are essential for promoting human health. Clinical trials on new drugs and interventions are registered to provide the public, health professionals, researchers, and sponsors with reliable information, rendering the design and implementation of clinical trials transparent, and enabling the search and evaluation of such trials on the internet. 8, 9 People can retrieve crucial information about the initial stages of the trials from clinical trial registries, and learn from the methods used to conduct them. Registering clinical trials also facilitates international cooperation and enables sponsors to use funds in meaningful ways. In addition, registration prevents researchers from making biased decisions because of publication bias or incomplete reports, wherein, the negative results are withheld or ambiguous results have been presented. 10, 11 ClinicalTrials.gov is the largest registry of clinical trials, which has been established and is operated by the US National Institutes of Health and the US National Library of Medicine. All types of clinical trials conducted worldwide can be registered in advance on ClinicalTrials. gov. Besides, this website enables users to search for all ongoing international multicenter clinical trials. 12 13 reviewed the clinical trials on ginseng, 14 and studied the characteristics of TCM clinical trials. 15 Although Zhang et al analyzed the clinical trials, their study period ended on February 12, 2020, and only 87 intervention trials were studied. 16 The number of COVID-19 clinical trials registered with ClinicalTrials.gov and ChiCTR has grown considerably over the past 3 months.

During the pandemic, frontline medical staff are required to constantly improve the treatment methods; therefore, many clinical trials are necessary.

Most retrieval trials are exploratory, and their sample size is not supposed to be too large. 13 Thus, the expected sample size can be completed in a short time, and the trial results can be obtained faster. These clinical trials were conducted with the main features of the current outbreak; therefore, they should be accepted during this pandemic period.

Given the high cure rate of the disease, improving symptoms is critical for reducing the critical illness rate and mortality. These indicators of efficacy can be evaluated in the near future. As a crucial discharge standard, the rate at which the subjects become virus-free represent the recovery rate of the patients and the duration infected with the virus, respectively. The absence of detectable virus nucleic acid can reduce the spread of the virus. Because the mortality rate of mild to moderate patients with this disease is low, the mortality rate is suitable as the primary endpoint for severe patients.

In the retrieved studies, even with the administration of antiviral therapy, further interventions were still required.

Both trials were randomized, double-blind, and placebo-controlled studies. One trial involved 308 mild to moderate COVID-19 patients, and the other involved 453 severe COVID-19 patients. Under the registration number NCT04257656, 453 severe COVID-19 patients were scheduled for admission. With the outbreak under control in China, 237 cases (remdesivir group; 158 and placebo group; 79) were enrolled in the trial, and the study results showed no significant clinical benefit among adult patients admitted for severe COVID-19 treated with remdesivir. 23 Also, antimalarial drugs potentially treat COVID-19. 24 The results by Gautret et al showed that hydroxychloroquine is significantly associated with virus elimination in COVID-19 patients and its effect is reinforced by azithromycin. 25 A limitation of the present study is that the results of the clinical trials were not included. As viral spread is currently being controlled, the number of patients will greatly decrease in China; thus, meeting the needs of all patients registered in clinical trials may be difficult. As the current pandemic worsens, the more we will have to adhere to the evidencebased medicine, for the recovery of the patients, and the effective prevention, and control of the pandemic.
