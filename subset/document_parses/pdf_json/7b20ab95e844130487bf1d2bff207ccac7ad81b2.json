The most sensitive test involves the detection of viral RNA using RT-qPCR, with 4 many commercial kits now available for this purpose. However, these are expensive and supply of 5 such kits in sufficient numbers cannot always be guaranteed. We therefore developed a multiplex 6 assay using well-established SARS-CoV-2 targets alongside internal controls that monitor sample 7 quality and nucleic acid extraction efficiency. Here, we establish that this test performs as well as 8 widely used commercial assays, but at substantially reduced cost. Furthermore, we demonstrate 9 >1,000-fold variability in material routinely collected by nose-and-throat swabbing. The inclusion of 10 a human control probe in our assay provides additional information that could help reduce false 11 negative rates.",

In many countries the number of active cases is now declining, largely due to 16 increased public awareness and effective public health strategies centred on reducing the rate of 17 transmission. However, the number of cases worldwide is still on the increase with around 100,000 18 new cases recorded every day at the beginning of June and more than 200,000 new daily cases since 19 the beginning of July. Many of these new infections are now occurring in lower-middle-income 20 countries.

The most sensitive test to diagnose infected individuals 24 involves the detection of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA using RT-qPCR, most commonly using samples 25 collected using nasopharyngeal (nose-and-throat) swabs, although there is increasing evidence that 26 the use of saliva may be a valid alternative [1] . Many commercial kits are now available, most of 27 which employ multiplex RT-qPCR detecting 2 or 3 different SARS-CoV-2 targets, and generally 28 include an internal control to show successful nucleic acid extraction. However, such kits are often 29 costly and their supply in sufficient numbers cannot always be guaranteed. We therefore developed 30 a similar multiplex assay using well-established SARS-CoV-2 targets and internal controls, which can 31 be carried out at a significantly lower cost and provides more flexibility to ensure resilience against 32 potential shortages in reagent supplies. 33 assays were published on the WHO website [4] . Based on the data available at the time, we decided 38 to focus our initial efforts on targeting the following SARS-CoV-2 genes: E (envelope), RdRp (RNA-39 dependent RNA polymerase) and N (nucleocapsid) [5, 6] . proposed the E gene 40 as a useful target for first line screening, with the RdRp gene suggested as a good target for 41 confirmatory/discriminatory assays [7, 8] . The N gene was central to the USA Centers for Disease 42",

For example, the use of control primers/probe specific to a human RNA 216 transcript (the RPP30 primers/probe described here detect both RNA and genomic DNA) would give 217 even greater confidence in sample quality, i.e. ensuring that it contains intact RNA.

Lysis and wash buffers can either be replaced with guanidine thiocyanate (GnSCN) or guanidine hydrochloride (GnHCl) containing solutions, depending on reagent availability. In our preliminary tests, all performed equally well (data not shown). All lysis buffers (Omega TNA, GnSCN Lysis Buffer, GnHCl Lysis Buffer, each with/without isopropanol) were shown to inactivate coronavirus after 15 min incubation (Fig S4) . Briefly, to determine whether lysis buffers inactivate coronaviruses, 200 \u00b5l CoV 229E-GFP [5, 6] stock (9.6x10 5 pfu/ml in DMEM, 10% FCS, 1% NEAA) was mixed with lysis buffer at the recommended ratio (240 \u00b5l lysis buffer without isopropanol or 520 \u00b5l lysis buffer with isopropanol, i.e. 240 \u00b5l buffer and 280 \u00b5l isopropanol). For positive infection controls, virus was mixed with 240 or 520 \u00b5l medium. All mixes were inverted 8 times and incubated at room temperature for 15 min. Cytotoxic components were then removed by centrifugation at 4\u00b0C using Microcon filter columns (Millipore; 30 kDa cut-off), and two 0.5 ml PBS washes, similar to previously described methods [7, 8] . Remaining virus particles were then resuspended in 200 \u00b5l DMEM and 50 \u00b5l of a 1/100 dilution added to HUH7 cells (a cell line permissive to infection by CoV 229E). Cells were seeded the previous day at 1.8x10 4 /well in a black 96-well plate (Corning), and were at ~80% confluence for infection. Cultures were monitored daily for cell viability, cytopathic effects and GFP expression using microscopy. No significant cell death was observed for any of the samples. Relative fluorescence was measured using a Clariostar BMG Plate Reader at 72 h, with fluorescence for a non-infected control set to zero. No fluorescence was observed for any of the lysis buffer treated samples (Fig S4) , and fluorescence microscopy confirmed the absence of GFP positive cells (data not shown), consistent with complete viral inactivation.",

No. M6246), using the Supplementary Protocol for NP Swabs (April 2020 234 version). Briefly, 200 \u00b5l VTM was taken from patient swab sample inside a Class-2 safety cabinet and 235 mixed with 240 \u00b5l TNA Lysis Buffer, 1 \u00b5l carrier RNA and extraction controls (MS2 and PhHV) in 236 screw capped tubes, for virus inactivation. After incubation at room temperature for at least 15 min, 237 samples were transferred from tubes into 96-well KingFisher Deep well plates (Cat. No. 95040450) 238 containing 280 \u00b5l isopropanol and 2 \u00b5l Mag-Bind Particles per well, using a Biomek NX P Automated 239 Liquid Handler (Beckman Coulter). Plates were then moved and the isolation completed on a 240 KingFisher Flex robot (Cat. No. 5400610) as instructed by the manufacturer, including washes with 241 350 \u03bcL VHB Buffer and 2x 350 \u03bcL SPR Buffer, and RNA finally eluted in 50 \u00b5l of nuclease-free water in 242 KingFisher 96 microplates (Cat.

The use of this protocol could further reduce the cost per 245 test, but would require additional validation. For details of this RNA isolation protocol, probes (Table 2) were synthesised and HPLC purified by LGC BioSearch Technologies 250 (Risskov, Denmark), and dissolved in IDTE (10 mM Tris, 0.1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0) to prepare 100 \u03bcM 251 stocks.

One option would be to simply set an arbitrary cut-off, e.g. one could decide to re-test any 187 samples with RPP30 Ct >30, or with Ct values outside the 95% confidence interval. To determine a 188 robust cut-off limit, collection of RPP30 data for a much larger number of patient samples would be 189 desirable. Nonetheless, RPP30 data, as it stands, can be useful with the interpretation of cases for 190 which only one of the SARS-CoV-2 targets is (weakly) positive, to prompt potential resampling to 191 obtain a definitive result. False negative test results are an important ongoing issue. Low sample 192 quality, for example in case of self-sampling, is one possible reason for this. Systematic inclusion of 193 an internal human control to provide sample quality metrics, could therefore be an important step 194 to reduce the number of false negatives. 195",
