The discussion is based on the legal possibility and economic feasibility of expanding the list of financial instruments by creating a fundamentally new model of digital payments. However, despite the importance of this issue, states and the digital community have not yet come to a common understanding of the starting points on which the concept of a national digital currency (CBDC) should be based. In this regard, the purpose of this study is to identify the legal and economic advantages and disadvantages of two types of CBDC: direct and hybrid. To achieve this goal, the theoretical views on this issue were studied, as well as the conclusions made by experts in the course of a practical study of the CBDC possibilities.",

The problem, however, is that in most countries the discussion of the CBDC concept is largely academic. And only a few states have officially announced their intention to introduce a digital equivalent of the national currency (China, Singapore, Thailand, Sweden, Canada, etc.). At the same time, many countries are considering the possibility of introducing such practices in the future (Argentina, Brazil, the Great Britain, the Netherlands, India, Malaysia, the United States, Tunisia, France, South Africa, etc.).",

It is obvious that the introduction of a new model can lead to unexpected legal and economic consequences associated with a lack of understanding of certain aspects of the problem. The concept of CBDC itself is clear at first glance, but a more detailed examination reveals a number of issues that need to be addressed at the initial stage of the issue. In particular, it is important to understand what CBDC will create and release, who will control it, who will be responsible if the system fails or data leaks, and what are the prospects for implementing CBDC in countries with weak economies and undeveloped digital infrastructure. Some of these issues will be discussed in this paper.",

This approach involves taking into account the position of the legislator, his political will, which dictates both the very initiation of monetary reform, introducing CBDC, and the fundamental characteristics of the system of state digital money. The approach of legal formalism was not left without attention. The literal interpretation of legal norms assumed by this approach makes it possible to determine the legal grounds (or lack thereof) for the introduction of new settlement instruments in the current law. In addition, the same approach helps to find a strategy for adapting CBDC to legal norms that are not directly related to the financial sphere; for example, the law on personal data protection and the law on information and information systems. The risk-based approach is central to the methodology of this work [5] . The introduction of CBDC is inevitably associated with the emergence of circumstances, many of which would be difficult to predict today. However, some of the risks of CBDC can be extrapolated to CBDC-like systems. These include, in particular, systems of existing settlement instruments: cash, electronic money, and bank payments. This work is devoted to the analysis of these risks and determining ways to minimize them.",

In this case, the CBDC will become the perfect tool for combating a wide range of any crimes related to money settlements, including Anti Money Laundering and Counter-Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT), fighting corruption, tax evasion, export of funds abroad, currency crimes, etc. In case of refusal of cash and the CBDC introduction, the crime of counterfeiting will become impossible [12] . However, such \"financial omniscience\" can be associated with a number of difficulties. For example, in the case of a CBDC that is fully controlled by the central bank, it will force the central bank to constantly interact with financial and tax control authorities, with judicial and administrative authorities, to ensure confidentiality in a complex system, and to perform other powers that the central bank may not be ready for or not to have the authority to perform it.",

In particular, the questions of CBDC typology in the modern literature find only partial solutions and only within the framework of solving applied problems. In 2018, experts identified two types of CBDC: general purpose CBDCs or retail, available for use by anyone wholesale, which are available to a limited number of people, for example, for mutual settlements between private banks [3] . Another classification has been proposed by R3 researchers, who identified three types of CBDC [6] : 1) Direct CBDC. CBDC that are issued, provided and fully controlled by the issuing central bank. An example of a direct CBDC is e-krona, developed by the Sweden bank [6] . A number of authors believe that under the CBDC system, the central bank will be able to perform taxation much more effectively, which will reduce the tax rate [9] . 2) Indirect CBDC or synthetic CBDC. This type of CBDC is issued by third-party organizations, such as private banks or payment companies, but the cost of such a CBDC is provided by the reserves of the central bank [18] . It is a fair opinion that this system can harmoniously complement the existing banking system [16] . An extreme form of synthetic CBDC (quasi-CBDC) was described in one of the projects of the Bank of England, in which means providing the cost of a digital currency issued by private firms, will not be the reserves of the central bank, but will be the means of these firms in custody of the central bank [6] .",

Such payment instruments are created and destroyed only by the central bank, but their use and circulation are provided by other organizations. The advantage of hybrid CBDC is that the responsibility for the order of their turnover and use (including AML/CFT control) is assigned to the banks that work with the CBDC, and not to the central bank. As an example, we can cite Chinese CBDC and one of the projects of the English CBDC. As demonstrated above, the two-level system inherent in hybrid CBDC, is superior to other forms of digital currencies in many ways. Other authors, in particular, came to the same opinion, noting that competition between intermediary companies can have a positive role in strengthening the CBDC system [7] .",

However, the implementation of this model will require significant changes in the current legislation and, firstly, in terms of minimizing certain legal and economic risks. Currently, it is a two-level system of hybrid CBDC CBDC that allows you to neutralize or minimize most of the risks associated with the introduction of CBDC into circulation. This model can be almost painlessly integrated into modern law, since it does not differ significantly from the existing systems of bank settlements or electronic money settlements. Most of the responsibilities related to ensuring the work of the CBDC and compliance with control functions (the role of tax agents, customer identification, and AML/CFT supervision), as today, will be assigned to intermediary organizations. And non-price competition between them will help to maintain a high level of quality of the CBDC system, both from the point of view of the state and citizens who use CBDC on a daily basis.",
