Methods: The Edmonton Southside Primary Care Network implemented an evidence-based PR program within the setting of the patient's medical home. Results: Post-program evaluation demonstrated improvement in 6-minute walk distance, lower body strength, COPD health status, and quality of life, as well as a reduction in emergency department visits 1 year after program completion.",

Forty-one PCNs across Alberta bring local physicians and multidisciplinary health care professionals together to provide comprehensive patient care within the patient's medical home [10] . In 2011 the College of Family Physicians of Canada (CFPC) released A Vision for Canada: Family Practice -The Patient's Medical Home, a made in Canada, evidence-based vision for the future of primary care by transforming the health care system to better meet the needs of everyone living in Canada [11] . As defined by CFPC, a patient's medical home is a primary care practice defined by its patients as the place they feel most comfortable presenting and discussing their personal and family health and medical concerns [11] . Team-based care is one of the core functions of the patient's medical home. Building a team with a diverse mix of professional backgrounds creates an opportunity to redefine what is considered optimal, based on the needs of the practice and the community it serves. A high-performing team is essential to delivering more comprehensive, coordinated, and effective care centred on the patient's needs [11] . Continuity of care is another core function of the patient's medical home model, which enables and fosters long-term relationships between patients and the care team, thereby ensuring continuous care across the patient's lifespan [11] .",

A PCN family physician or multidisciplinary team member refers individuals to the program. All referrals must include chest x-ray, electrocardiogram, and pulmonary function test supporting a chronic respiratory condition. The individual is booked into a pre-assessment clinic that includes establishing baseline 6-minute walk distance (6MWD), quality of life scores, and health screening questionnaires. As well, there is a review by the team respirologist to assess suitability and safety to participate in the program. A respiratory therapist and exercise specialist (Clinical Exercise Physiologist) facilitate the program, with additional educational support provided by a dietitian and behavioural health consultants comprised of nurses and social workers. Table 1 provides a summary of the weekly education delivered during the program. The program is located at the ESPCN main office, with use of a dedicated gym space that provides access to a walking track, treadmill, weights, resistance bands, benches, and stationary bikes to fulfill the program's cardiopulmonary and strength exercise components.",

The role of PR, although has primarily focused on COPD, is evolving to show benefit in the outcomes of other lung-related illnesses, such as severe asthma or pulmonary hypertension, interstitial lung disease and even lung cancers. However, access to these programs is limited. The BFH PR program is a first of its kind program to deliver PR in the patient's medical home. This novel approach provides several advantages to PR delivery including familiarity of the patients with the PR staff members, education and exercise in familiar environments and primary care support as this program is endorsed by the PCN that they belong to. This improved knowledge translation to primary care physicians regarding the role PR plays in the treatment of patients with chronic respiratory diseases is of clear advantage to improve practice patterns. In addition, there is routinely a large waitlist for PR programs in Alberta, approximately 400 patients at any point [9] . ESPCN patients can have faster access to PR, due to a potentially smaller waitlist, as the program is prioritized for patients belonging to ESPCN. The BFH patient referrals come from family physicians, respiratory therapists, and other clinicians in the patient's medical home. These are all strengths of the BFH program and is in keeping with current CTS recommendations for patients to attend PR if they have persistent symptoms, poor exertional capability, and health status despite optimized pharmacotherapy [37] .",

As part of the patient's medical home, patients receive tailored presentations on nutrition by a registered dietitian, improvement of physical activity with an exercise specialist, stress and anxiety management with a behavioural health consultant, and have the option to complete enduring power of attorney, personal directives, and goals of care with a healthy-aging social worker.

There is a lack of data that states acceptable participant drop out rates for similar PR programs. However, ESPCN completion rates are consistent with other PR studies in Canada [8] .

Program evaluation of PR would be strengthened by mixed-methods approaches, for example, the use of qualitative participant and facilitator feedback data to inform program improvements. Expanding the evaluation plan to include post-graduation data at six months or beyond allows for assessment of the longevity of the program benefits and provides an opportunity to reconnect patients with their primary care team. The current COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the need for continued optimization of telehealth or other virtual PR delivery platforms [38] . Prior to the pandemic, some BFH attendees did not complete the full program due to a variety of barriers to in-person attendance such as transportation and mobility. During the pandemic, BFH has transitioned into virtual programming that includes LWWCOPD education, guest-speaker presentations, and a modified exercise program to support those with chronic lung conditions. Virtual/telehealth programing supports patients with chronic lung disease by improving health-related quality of life and overall exertional capability comparable to in-person programing [39] . More research is warranted to understand its role in reduction of health care utilization and exacerbation recognition [40] .",
