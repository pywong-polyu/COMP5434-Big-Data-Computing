We calculated descriptive statistics on the presence of high-risk conditions, influenza antiviral administrations, and severity endpoints. Results: Among 5.1 million hospitalizations, we identified 29,520 hospitalizations with an influenza diagnosis; 64% were treated with an influenza antiviral within 2 days of admission, and 25% were treated >2 days after admission. Patients treated >2 days after admission had more comorbidities than patients treated within 2 days of admission. Patients never treated during hospitalization had more documentation of cardiovascular and other diseases than treated patients. We observed more severe endpoints in patients never treated (death = 3%, mechanical ventilation [MV] = 9%, intensive care unit [ICU] = 26%) or patients treated >2 days after admission (death = 2%, MV = 14%, ICU = 32%) than in patients treated earlier (treated on admission: death = 1%, MV = 5%, ICU = 23%, treated within 2 days of admission: death = 1%, MV = 7%, ICU = 27%). Conclusions: We identified important trends in influenza severity related to treatment timing in a large inpatient dataset, laying the groundwork for the use of this and other inpatient EMR data for influenza and other respiratory virus surveillance.

EMR data can provide timely and detailed clinical information, and the feasibility of conducting public health surveillance with EMRs has previously been demonstrated. [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] However, capturing and analyzing these data in real-time during a public health emergency are a challenge unless systems are already in place. Simonsen and colleagues have highlighted the use of seasonal influenza as an example infection when developing systems built on \"big data\" for infectious disease surveillance. 10 As part of the FDA's Sentinel System, 11, 12 we explored the feasibility of utilizing inpatient EMR data for collecting and analyzing treatments and outcomes in hospitalized patients to support the FDA's need for timely information during a public health emergency. 13 Sentinel is an active surveillance system that uses routinely collected electronic healthcare data to support FDA's regulatory decision making. Our objective was to assess the ability to identify medications, severity, and other key data relevant to seasonal and pandemic respiratory virus activity in hospitalized patients, using seasonal influenza as a use case. We describe the baseline characteristics, healthcare utilization, complications, and endpoints of hospitalized adults with an influenza diagnosis from March 2017 through March 2020, using data on discharged patients.",

[16] [17] [18] March 2017 was selected as the study start as this is when the hospitals systematically began providing medication administration data. Please see Appendix S1for the study design diagram. Within this period, we identified hospitalizations with an influenza diagnosis (via International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification codes [ICD-10-CM]; see Appendix S2 for code lists). We included data on patients discharged and with complete billing only and did not include hospitalizations for patients still admitted or not completely coded when the datasets were created. For reference, we also examined characteristics of all hospitalizations captured in the database.",

Considerations for ensuring real-world data are fit for purpose have been commented on previously. 2, 25 We examined oxygen delivery as well as ordinal endpoints in hospitalizations with influenza diagnosis codes. Although we found that up to 40% of influenza non-ICU hospitalizations had evidence of supplemental oxygen use, we understand that oxygen use may be underestimated if only procedure codes are relied upon. 26 We were unable to identify BiPAP in this study, which was not unexpected, as billing practices may bundle this with other care and our study identified oxygen delivery based on diagnosis and procedure codes. We expect that both oxygen supplementation and BiPAP use are included in nursing documentation within many EMR systems, and thus it may be possible to extract such information as needed. Future studies in similar inpatient datasets should consider exploring the feasibility of retrieving and analyzing nursing documentation to examine the capture of and ability to attain more specific information regarding type and duration of oxygen therapy.",

As influenza antivirals are recommended for use within 2 days of symptom onset, this limits conclusions that can be drawn regarding antiviral treatment timing. Patients are often not well tracked across hospitals, and thus our unit of analysis was limited to the individual hospitalization. The study did not include children, but future studies could explore expanding the dataset to include pediatric patients. Finally, the majority of data used in this study were collected prior to the COVD-19 pandemic beginning in early 2020. Data collected in situations where healthcare systems are strained due to a public health emergency should be interpreted with consideration of circumstances under which clinical care was provided. It is possible that usual coding practices may not be adhered to, 2 which could influence future analyses using similar data sources during a public health emergency.In conclusion, we found that a large-scale source of inpatient EMR data within the Sentinel System can provide useful information to FDA on patient care, patient characteristics, and medication use during seasonal influenza, a proxy for other respiratory viruses more broadly. This ability to examine the rich clinical information collected during a hospitalization, including procedure and medication administration dates, has been leveraged for the FDA's COVID-19response.27 For seasonal influenza, we also report importantcomplications, and ordinal endpoints. Inpatient EMR systems at large can provide important sources of timely information during public health emergencies.
