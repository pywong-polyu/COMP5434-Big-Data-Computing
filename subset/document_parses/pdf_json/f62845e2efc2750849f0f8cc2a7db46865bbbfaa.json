According to the US Center for Disease Prevention and Control (2019), up to 50% of antibiotic use is not medically justified. This situation is particularly worse in developing communities which have unregulated over-the-counter sales and a weak water and sewage infrastructure. For example, a recent typhoid fever outbreak in Pakistan has been associated to the antibiotic resistance caused by inappropriate use of drugs as well as poor sanitation and contaminated water supplies (Cohen, 2018) . Recent estimates by UN Interagency Coordination Group on Antimicrobial Resistance (2019) suggest that AMR diseases are responsible for about 700,000 annual deaths worldwide. Without concrete action, the death toll could reach up to 10 million a year by 2050.",

            "text": "Antibiotics have reasonable roles in the management of COVID-19 particularly to treat suspected or confirmed bacterial co-infections (Rawson et al., 2020a) . The World Health Organization has advised that antibiotics should not be used for the purposes of treating COVID-19 except in the presence of bacterial co-infections (WHO, 2020). However, growing evidence suggests that very high proportion of COVID-19 patients are being unnecessarily treated with antibiotics. Empirical antibiotics were prescribed for 90% of patients despite low confirmation of secondary bacterial infections (b10%) (Lai et al., 2020) . Wei et al. (2020) also noted that antibiotics were started on admission in 59% of COVID-19 patients despite the absence of definitive evidence of bacterial coinfection in these patients. Moreover, 98% of these prescriptions were empiric. Similarly, another very recent review of data from covid-19 cases, mostly from Asia, reported that N70% of patients received antimicrobial treatment despite only b10% having bacterial or fungal coinfections (Rawson et al., 2020a) . Moreover, the same study found that broad spectrum antibiotics, intended to kill a wide range of bacteria, are being administered. Overuse of these antibiotics can stimulate AMR in the acute care settings (Hsu, 2020; Rawson et al., 2020b) . Premature hype surrounding possible treatments for COVID-19 could also spike the prescription of antibiotics. This has been seen for the antibiotic azithromycin in combination with the drug hydroxychloroquine causing shortages in the US (Reardon, 2020) . Though unmeasured, there is a possibility of a large number of people taking antibiotics in misguided attempts to self-medicate to protect themselves from the virus. This has the potential to be very prevalent in developing communities where antibiotics can be easily obtained without a prescription. A high proportion of these drugs in bioactive forms is excreted into the wastewater from where they may enter in natural systems (Slater et al., 2011) .",

Therefore, frequent hand-washing with plain soap and water for at least 20 s has been advised as an impactful way to prevent the spread of COVID-19 (WHO, 2020). Soaps contain surfactants that dissolve the lipid-bilayer, an integral part of SARS-CoV-2 envelop, leading to the deactivation of virus. These deactivated viral molecules are then encapsulated within micelles which are then washed away (Chaudhary et al., 2020) . A 20-second wash provides sufficient time for the soap molecules to dissolve the lipid-bilayer of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.",

Pollutant input prevention at the production source complemented with wastewater treatment is crucial to ensure water safety (K\u00fcmmerer et al., 2018) . However, effective input prevention in case of antimicrobials and other pharmaceuticals calls for responsible use of drugs and personal care products by individuals. Intensive information campaigns should be launched to educate the masses about the ecological consequences of misusing antibacterial products. A large portion of the population is creating the habit of regular hand washing as a result of the pandemic. These practices will remain embedded even after the pandemic subsides. Therefore, educating the public about the unwanted effects of antimicrobial/antibacterial products during the pandemic will have the greatest opportunity to instilling change. Governments should ensure that advertising material and message of hygienic products are aligned with COVID-19 guidelines. We also urge researchers to evaluate the environmental consequences of the response measures to COVID-19 by focusing on therapeutic as well as non-therapeutic antimicrobials. ",
