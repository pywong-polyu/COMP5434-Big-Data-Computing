It is based on the concept of information propagation, which replaces the need for searching the required data by individual beings. The signal is modeled in a 2D grid of cells, it is directional and autonomously spreads to adjacent cells in the grid. This simple concept removes the need for analyzing remote locations during model update, and therefore, allows splitting the simulated environment between many computing processes, which communicate with fixed number of neighbors once in a single time step, which is the crucial requirement of super-scalable algorithm defined in [5] . The basic version of the method allows representing two-dimensional environments as grids of cells, which are split into equal fragments and updated in parallel. After each time step, the processes updating neighbor fragments exchange information about signal and beings located in common borders. The method requires defining dedicated simulation models, however, in return it can provide linear scalability of simulation. Linear scalability has been achieved in several tests performed on HPC hardware, which involved up to 3456 computing cores.",

Further work on signal-based models for pedestrians led to the problem considered in this paper: the need for modeling complex, multi-level buildings, which cannot be represented in two dimensions. Similar problem can be encountered in modeling of other species habitations, like anthills, bee hives or mole tunnel systems.

In many cases a discrete workspace model is sufficient to represent desired features of the beings and reproduce phenomena observed in real systems, like in the wellrecognized Nagel-Schreckenberg freeway traffic model [8] .

Problem 2: People in corridors that could not move forward but could go back, were moving back and forth waiting to go further or were choosing to go back to staircase entrances. Problem 1 was a result of a sequential order of updating cells. A person that was trying to enter an upper staircase was above the people in the staircase, thus the person was updated before the people in the corridor. This way, the person's movement was favored and congestion was visible in the corridors and there were no crowds close to the upper entrances to the upper staircases. Similarly, trying to enter a lower staircase, the movement of people already in the staircase was favored. A person trying to enter the staircase was updated after people in the staircase managed to occupy all empty spaces, preventing the person from entering the staircase. Figure 5 shows both of the situations. A simple solution to this problem was to update locations of people in a random order. Figure 4 shows the results of such an approach.

We introduced the alternative to the standard, grid-based neighborhood as a means to generalizing the idea of buffer zones present in the framework. The new mechanism greatly increased the flexibility of the method, while avoiding the massive growth of complexity that would result from switching to full 3D grid environment. At the same time, the scalability of the original solution remained unhindered, as the alteration did not increase the amount of data exchanged between computational nodes in the synchronization step. The evacuation scenario used as a demonstration of the new capabilities of the method provided results confirming that such a scenario can be accurately represented in the resulting framework.",
