In the cutting and transformation of the body that does not lose its identity. As in the example below. The potato, despite assuming various forms, textures, flavors, smells and \"sounds\" is still a potato. It is the potato that prevails in the memory of the experience (Fig. 3) . And so the letters came out of their original form and merged into geometric shapes, thus resulting in a logo of strong symbolic value. Among what the shapes represent and how these shapes will be representative of the object, the Msc in Food Design. The duality between the graphic symbol must contain conceptually and what it must convey, while at the same time embedded in the values and reputation already pre-assigned to the organization is one of the designer's major challenges. (Barradas 2015) . Each of the letters has recognizable shapes in gastronomy, the potato, the watermelon, even a hamburger, but all these shapes will be identifiers of Msc in Food Design in the sense that they will be built as they exist. This idea is explored by Paul Rand about the IBM logo in Heller (1999) in the same way that there's nothing inherent in horizontal lines or vertical lines that says \"computer\" except what you read into because of association with a good company. It takes time to grow. Brands need time to align their corporate image in the sense that this is the junction of their culture, their products, their services, their quality, their ability to communicate, to innovate, etc. (Costa 2011) .",

Since the beginning that we aim a brand identity that was dynamic and that translate the sensorial feeling, that is one on the most outstanding features of the food design masters. Another important aspect was the concern that the graphic representation needs to work well in the different environments: print and digital ones. Because of that we have to be very careful on choose of typography and the symbol representation for the brand mark had to be strong enough to survive in such different supports.",
