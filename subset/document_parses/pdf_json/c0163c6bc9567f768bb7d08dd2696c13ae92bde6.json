[2] [3] [4] [5] This COVID-19 crisis has weakened the ability of countries to withstand additional global shocks. The combined impacts of the pandemic, the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and increasing inflation in many countries are estimated to push up to 95 million more people into poverty in 2022 compared with prepandemic projections. 6 The consequences of not ending the acuity of this pandemic are more illness and death, health systems stretched to the limit, deepening social divisions, widening economic inequalities, and further losses to individual households.",

Benefits should supersede national security concerns. \u2022 WHO member states should treat the recommended reforms with the urgency required and agree pathways to make decisions more rapidly, for later incorporation under a pandemic accord if necessary and practicable. \u2022 Member states should agree a clear plan to implement all recommendations, including the limit of the terms of the Director-General and Regional Directors to one of 7 years. \u2022 Flexible funding, the increase in assessed contributions to 50% of the base programme budget, and the proposal for a replenishment process for WHO should be approved and implemented without delay. \u2022 The WHO Secretariat should report on progress on its resourcing of country offices, and on processes towards depoliticising staff recruitment. Health Regulations (IHR) aimed at faster alert and response, 18 are meaningful steps towards fixing the international legal framework. The announcement by the Government of Indonesia of G20 consensus to establish a financial intermediary fund is a step towards closing the US$10-15 billion annual funding gap that the report of the Independent Panel for Pandemic Preparedness and Response 1 and the G20 High Level Independent Panel identified. 12, 19 At WHO, the member state Working Group on Sustainable Financing also made progress towards improving WHO's fiscal autonomy by recommending non-earmarked funding, and an increase in assessed contributions to cover 50% of the WHO base budget, by contrast to the 16% in the previous programme budget. 20 Work is also underway to develop improved tools for assessing preparedness, with more dynamic metrics being developed and piloted in a new universal periodic health review. 21 The major issue remains a lack of sustained high-level political leadership that will bring the coherence and urgency required to fragmented reform processes. Much energy will be spent on developing a new pandemic instrument, a new financial intermediary fund, and reforms at WHO, but how will this all be linked together? WHO's health emergency preparedness, response, and resilience white paper 22 suggests a framework anchored to the organisation, but effective pandemic preparedness and response extends well beyond WHO, and so should high-level monitoring and oversight.",

Steps to support vaccine manufacturing capacity in lowincome and middle-income countries are also running into challenges-eg, one manufacturer had to stop production of COVID-19 vaccine due to insufficient orders. 24 With no appreciable progress to create a platform that can equitably deliver global public goods, and the current sclerotic and insufficient progress to agree a Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property (TRIPS) waiver, newer and more effective vaccines, diagnostics, and treatments will not be distributed equitably during this and future pandemic threats.
