The emerging trends in SARS-CoV-2 genome data show specific mutation and genetic diversity, which could provide the basis to develop a cocktail of vaccine and may also be used to develop the region-specific diagnostic tool, thus decreasing the chances of testing failures in fields. Since the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is subject to the extent of human interaction, the insights from the correlation of genetic diversity with epidemiological parameter would give paramount information to tackle this transmission. Previously, studies have also correlated the epidemiological data with gut microbiome and its role in immunomodulation for maintaining health status, and such information could be generated from recovered individuals from different demographic regions. It will help in designing a probiotic-based diet for modulation of the gut microbiome, and that could be another plausible prophylactic treatment option. The genomics data suggest that a specific variant of SARS-CoV-2 gets enriched with the specific demographic region. Overall, demographic data suggests that host influences mutation and expression of the virus. Hence, the experiences from the clinical intervention for that region should be considered in control and treatment strategies.",

Initially, substantial evidence to state the mutation rate in the novel SARS-CoV-2 from Wuhan city was lacking. However, a recent study from Iceland has highlighted that the virus has acquired more than 40 mutations, and the strains grouped into three different clusters [4] . The initial studies identified two major types of virulent SARS-CoV-2 circulating among the Chinese population and the prevalence of the aggressive form decreased after early January 2020, and the milder type has become common owing to selective pressure due to human intervention [5] . Thus, it is crucial to understand the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 across different temperate countries and populations.

            "text": "Past one month, mostly all the states of India are gripped by SARS-CoV-2. Understanding how it is spreading within the subcontinent would be a gruesome challenge. The genomic epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 suggests that there is a molecular evolution of the variants which are supposedly endemic, making this pandemic more challenging to tackle. There is an urgent and prompt need to collect, collate and analyse data of every traveller reaching India from different parts of the world. Moreover, based on SARS-CoV-2 infected/carrier cases so far, the inferences should be drawn to develop the template for the massive epidemiological profiling of SARS-CoV-2 strain across the pan-India. Still, the question remains that once the strains find different host genotype does it remain the same genetically from where it has originated. GISAID analysis suggests that there are variation and influence of host on the primary sequence of the virus. Till date, two genomes available from India showed clustering closer to the strains prevalent in China [6] . However, a unique mutation (A930V (24351C [ T)) in the spike surface glycoprotein of Indian SARS-CoV-2 genome which is absent in other strains from Wuhan, Italy, USA, and Nepal is reported [7] , highlighting the possible host-dependent modification and the endemic evolution of SARS-CoV-2. Figure 1 describes an approach to study the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and its demographic divergence. Identifying the location-specific strain and along with its specific mutation would help in developing a cocktail of vaccine and the region-specific diagnostic tool for covering the demographic genetic diversity of SARS-CoV-2. Linking this data with the extent of human interaction and epidemiological parameter would be important to tackle the mass scale transmission. The gut microbiome has a role in immunomodulation and maintaining health status; hence, a plausible prophylactic treatment option based on a probiotic-based diet could be envisaged through comparative genomics and microbiome studies [8] . The genomics data suggests that a specific variant of a virus gets enriched within the specific demographic region. Hence, the experiences from the clinical intervention for that region should be considered in control and treatment strategies.",

It will not only help in diagnosis but also suggest the possible treatment option to opt for these types of strains.
