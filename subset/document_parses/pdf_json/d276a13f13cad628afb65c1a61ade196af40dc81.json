The protective efficiency of face masks suppressing droplet infection owing to differences in the shape, medium, and doubling usage is predicted. Under the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic condition, many studies have been conducted to highlight that airborne transmission is the main transmission route. However, the virus infection prevention effect of face masks has not been sufficiently discussed, and thus remains as a controversial issue. Therefore, we aimed to provide a beneficial index for the society. The topology-free immersed boundary method, which is advantageous for complex shapes, was used to model the flow in the constriction area, including the contact surface between the face and mask. The jet formed from the oral cavity is guided to the outside through the surface of the mask and leaks from the gap between the face and mask.",

They proved that the reach of dispersive droplet plumes can be reduced to less than 8.33% using handmade masks and commercially available cone-style masks. In addition, Verma et al. have explored face shields 3 . Aydin et al. 4 and Fischer et al. 5 investigated the effect of hand-made face masks made of various materials on reducing the number of droplets. They showed that face masks have a droplet dispersion suppressing efficiency of approximately 70-90%. Moreover, Stutt et al. 6 introduced an epidemiological mathematical model and a conventional susceptible infected removed compartmental model to predict the number of deaths from infection in the United States, which is consistent with their assumption that masks have an infection control effect of 50% or higher. We presented a comparable model using the statistical data on a cohort of infected people in Japan, which revealed the same preventive effect of face masks that approximately 75% of the population wore. However, the minimum particle size that can be captured by optical measurement is limited by the employed equipment and measurement conditions. The number of aerosol microdroplets contained in the human exhaled breath of several micrometers or less is controversial. For example, there are various theories regarding the number of droplets generated by human coughing.",

It has been shown that the particles can reach farther distances depending on the background airflow conditions. Numerical analysis by ANSYS Inc. 13 indicates that the reach of particles on the flow may change depending on the standing position of the marathon runners. The airflow and behavior of the droplets were not uniform and were significantly influenced by the environment. They shared the technique of expressing the flow field in the Euler grid system and coupling the motion of particles in the Lagrange system. Based on the multiphase analysis of fluid and solid particles, the details such as strong or weak coupling, and handling of humidity, temperature, and molar mass fraction are different. While the flow environment that must be reproduced is complex, the particle size is limited to small ones on the order of micrometers to millimeters; therefore, this approach seems to be the most efficient and reliable method at present.",

Lei et al. 14 and Zhu et al. 15 investigated the splash-suppressing effect of N95 masks used by medical professionals. They concluded that in N95 masks, the resistance coefficient and expiratory flow velocity of the mask material have a direct effect on the filter-to-face seal elimination. It was assumed that the mask was in a close contact with the face. Nevertheless, their results cannot be referred to as a general conclusion for generally available face masks, such as disposable surgical masks, fabric masks, and handmade cloth masks. Because the N95 mask makes it easy to express the gap between the face and mask with a layer grid system, whereas typical surgical, fabric, and cloth masks have creases on, the flow path between the face and mask becomes complicated. There is a problem in reproducing the gap geometry, which makes it difficult to create a calculation grid. Inevitably, this gap has a significant influence on the droplet collection efficiency of the mask. Moreover, correct reproduction of this complicated flow path is the key to predicting the effect of a general face mask.",

A porous Darcy-type model was used for the mask-resistance modeling. A probability droplet penetration model based on random numbers was used to model the particle transmittance. The immersed boundary method (IBM), which is advantageous for complex shapes, was used to calculate the constricted area, including the contact surface between the face and mask. Subsequently, the difference in the amount of droplet leakage for various masks and respiratory conditions during exhalation and inhalation were evaluated.

Thus, the performance is slightly overestimated. This is because insufficient data, such as a collection rate of 1\u00b5m or more, were created by interpolation, and the collection rate for the aerosol reacted sensitively. In this analysis, the accuracy of the collection rate data for each aerosol particle size must be known. Figure 12 demonstrates a comparison between the entire mask performance with our experimental results for various types of masks. The performance was measured within less than 10\u00b5m diameter because of the limitations imposed by the experimental measurement equipment. In addition, the measured performance are summarized by the filter breathability (pressure loss) of the medium. Surgical masks have a high detection performance; however, they form a group with a large pressure loss and difficulty in breathing. Cloth masks allow air to easily pass through, while collection efficiency is low and shows a strong correlation between the breathability and mask performance. The urethane masks are superior in term of breathability; however, these are clearly less efficient than other masks. The calculations reveal qualitatively reasonable trends; however, several mask types have been overestimated such as the Y-shirt2 and cloth1 cases.

The shape of a double mask is obtained using the structural analysis when the double mask is worn in the same manner as described in Subsection II E 1. In the case of double mask, with two surgical masks or mixed usage of surgical and urethane masks, an improvement of approximately 10 to 15% in the particle collection performance was observed, which was owing to the narrowing the gaps between the faces by pressing with the outer mask. The collection rate was approximately equivalent to the single mask in close contact with the face, as described in Subsection III A 3.

In the case of the double surgical mask, no significant improvement in the particle collection performance was observed. Contrary to an intuitive perception, doubling the filter does not improve the performance twice that of a single filter. However, the collection rate is higher when a single mask is in close contact with the face. Hence, the mask performance highly depends on the face-fitting condition. In the case of surgical_urethane, the particle collection rate exceeded 90%, exhibiting the highest performance among other configurations. Comparable results have been reported in experiments conducted by CDC 25 , which use a pliable elastomeric source and receiver headforms.

Moreover, this expression is a mixed usage of the Peskin-type IBM 18 and Mittal-type IBM 19 . The correction of momentum in the solid region is applied to dummy cells arranged in the virtual space for each cell. Solid cells with an arbitrary width can always be placed for fluid cells that pass through narrow gaps, and calculations can be made reasonably even for thin surfaces, intricate flow paths, and flow paths that have gaps/overwraps. The typical size of a dummy cell was 5 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 5 cells. Furthermore, if the width of the distribution function is limited to one cell, the correction of the fluid region can be limited to the relevant fluid cell being calculated. The modified momentum of the solid region was obtained by interpolation from the ambient fluid velocity field. The point at which the foot of the perpendicular line, drawn from the solid region cell to the wall surface, is extended by the same distance to the fluid region. The point where the interpolation occurs is called the IP or imaginary point. Subsequently, the obtained velocity is inverted and input to the solid cell (ghost cell, GC). The corrected momentum on the ghost cell is used only when the divergence of the equation of motion is calculated. Therefore, an additional",

The two types of flow include a flow that leaks from the gap between the face and the mask surface, and a flow that permeates through the pressure loss from the entire mask surface. The gap between the face and mask forms a 3D complex shape, and these geometries are partially overlapped and narrow passed; however, the calculation method used in this study does not cause any problems. The initial particles placed in front of the mouth are diffused by the flow at every moment. These are separated into those captured by the mask surface (stick), penetrate the surface (penetrate), and leak through the gap (fly). Some particles are stuck on the face, and some flow to the region surrounded by the mouth and mask.Figure 7shows the particle distribution at a particle size normalized for clarity, and the color shows the state of the fly, penetrate, and stick. The collection rate of the particles captured by the face mask surface was obtained at the end of a A spray particles distribution colored/sized by the droplet diameter.",

In a general surgical mask, approximately 60-70% of aerosol particles of 5 \u00b5m or less are collected. Surgical masks exhibit a higher performance than that of cloth masks and fewer particles can pass through them. However, cloth masks have less leakage from the gap. Both mask types exhibited the same efficiency and approximately 70-80% of the particles were collected in both mask types. In the evaluation by volume ratio, the contribution of large particles was dominant, resulting in a deposition rate of approximately 100% for both mask types. To limit the measurement range within the fine particles (< 20\u00b5m) of interest in the case of COVID-19, a volume deposition rate of approximately 80% could be obtained, as could the particle number deposition rate.(a) Surgical mask.

However, approximately 1,000 particles (reduced by approximately 83%) reached the depth of the trachea. The number of particles inhaled can be reduced to approximately half by wearing a mask, even when gaps exist.
