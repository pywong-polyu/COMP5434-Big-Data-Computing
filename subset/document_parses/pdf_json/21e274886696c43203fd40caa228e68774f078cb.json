We empowered two individuals during the first phase of the process to propose more speculative and transformative issues. Two different participants were then asked during the third phase (workshop deliberation) to provide more critical inputs and actively push against the prevailing, dominant view during discussions.

Six of the nine issues they proposed in the first round made it through to the short list, and four of the six issues they proposed in the second round made it through to the final list of 20; with 38 participants, we would expect approximately only one issue for every second participant to make it through to the final list. 68% of participants had heard of the issues proposed by the devil's advocates, making these issues moderately more novel than the rest. Overall, an average of 70% of participants had heard of each issue. The level of novelty of the issues suggested by devil's advocates is partly skewed by two more wellknown issues which both scored 82.35%. When both of these issues were excluded, the devil's advocates suggestions were significantly more novel at an average of 61%.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Phase two: scoring"}, {"text": "The 41 issues with the highest scores were kept as a part of a shortlist. These were sent back to participants on the 13th of September 2019. Participants were assigned 'cynic' roles for each issue. This involved doing deeper background research into the topic. Each issue had at least two cynics, ensuring that at least three participants (the cynics and proposer) had an in-depth knowledge of the area. The workshop was held in Cambridge on the 9th of October 2019 with 25 participants; 13 could not attend due to other obligations. This resulted in a group with approximately the same characteristics as the group that was involved in he first two phases. The characteristics of both groups are compared in Table 3 . Overall, the gender balance was maintained (although the slight skew was reversed towards female participants), the disciplinary split between social and physical scientists was approximately the same, and the geographical coverage became less balanced due to the loss of participants from Peru, Zambia and Malaysia. These discussions were overseen by an experienced facilitator (WJS, with LK and AR acting as scribes) and followed a deliberate structure. Each issue was discussed for approximately ten minutes before being voted on anonymously. During discussions, proposers of the issue were asked not to speak until at least three other respondents had contributed. This was done to avoid biasing the conversation and allowing the cynics time to provide an orientating, more neutral intervention. The standardised z-scores for each issue were calculated and ranked at the end of the workshop, resulting in a top 20 list. The decision to keep the list to 20 was made by consensus by the workshop group and was influenced by a significant difference between the z-scores of the top and bottom 20 issues, but a much smaller spread of scores within the top 20. Participants were then given time to discuss the final list and whether any amendments were needed. The group was content with the spread of the final list and that it accurately reflected the deliberations and hence decided that no alterations were needed.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 710, "end": 717, "text": "Table 3", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Phase three: workshop preparation, deliberation and re-scoring"}, {"text": "A comparison of the rankings of the top 20 issues after the first and second round of scoring can be found in Supplementary file 2.

Indeed, four of the top five issues (80%) were outside the top 20 after the first round of scoring. This suggests that deliberation was effective in shifting participants' perspectives and scores. The novelty scores are also summarised in Supplementary file 2. The final list of issues had a slightly higher degree of novelty, but this was minor.
