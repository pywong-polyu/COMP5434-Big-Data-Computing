Interviews with eight women revealed that they engaged in discourse that opposed the practices of cutting female genitals as a human-rights violation. This discourse worked to protect those affected by the practices, but also stigmatized female genital cutting, making participants anticipate experiencing stigmatization during health care. Women's engagement in this discourse shaped their emotional health work to prepare for such encounters. This work included navigating feelings of worry, shame, and courage to understand what to expect during their own appointment; learning from family/friends' experiences; and seeking a clinic with the reputation of best care for women with female genital cutting. It is important to strive for more inclusive health care in which women do not have to engage in emotional health work to prepare for their clinical encounters.",

Female genital cutting involves removing parts of the external genitalia of those assigned female at birth for non-medical reasons. The World Health Organization (2008) categorizes the practices into four types: type I (removing the clitoris); type II (removing the labia minora); type III (cutting/stitching together the labia minora [IIIa] and/or majora [IIIb] , leaving a small opening); and type IV (all other harmful procedures). Female genital cutting is practiced in many parts of Africa, Asia, and the Middle East (World Health Organization, 2018) . Reasons for these practices depend on the cultural context and include enhancing attractiveness (Boddy, 1982) , hygiene (Hearst & Molnar, 2013) , and marriage prospects (Abathun et al., 2016) .",

Social relations go beyond relationships between people, instead drawing attention to connections between people, what they do, and written/unwritten texts.",

These (i.e., episiotomy; Moxey & Jones, 2016) and other obstetrical procedures (i.e., caesarean section; Ameresekere et al., 2011) are often feared by women with female genital cutting (Agbemenu et al., 2019) . Interpersonal challenges are also reported, like feeling different and exposed in interactions with health care personnel unfamiliar with female genital cutting (Berggren et al., 2006) . Women report working through pain (Perovi\u0107 et al., 2020) , stigmatization during care (Chalmers & Omer-Hashi 2000 , 2002 Jacobson et al., 2018) , and sensing that their health care preferences are not valued in the same way as women without female genital cutting . It is important to become aware of the discourses that shape these experiences for women with female genital cutting because discourse, as conceptual knowledge, shapes the way people think about certain phenomena.",

Anti-female genital mutilation discourse began with the use of this term (Hosken, 1978 (Hosken, , 1979 , expanding to the human-rights view that the practices require eradication (Andro & Lesclingand, 2016) . Hayes, 1975; Hosken, 1978 Hosken, , 1979 were some of the first researchers to use the term \"mutilation.\" Although they did not define their use of it, (Hosken, 1978) described \"mutilation\" as \"an impediment \u2026 that can be prevented and eradicated much like any disease\" (p. 155). A parallel discourse was thus induced, describing \"mutilation\" as a human-rights violation requiring eradication (Andro & Lesclingand, 2016) . This human-rights focus was solidified at the 1995 Beijing Fourth World Conference on Women where there was a call to end the practices on those grounds (Boddy, 2007) .",

These terms are encapsulated within antifemale genital mutilation discourse to depict the people, strategies, and activities that set particular standards and work toward the goal of eradicating \"mutilation.\" It is important to note that anti-female genital mutilation discourse has targeted only genital cutting of those assigned female at birth, and not those assigned male. This highlights a double standard in many western countries for female genital cutting being viewed as \"mutilation\" and a human-rights issue, while male circumcision is generally accepted (though some scholars have challenged this double standard; see Earp, 2014) .",

With institutional ethnography, the goal is to reveal how people's experiences come to happen. Ontologically, we view reality as historically embedded in the ways individuals and institutions function (Ramazanoglu & Holland, 2011; Smith, 2006) . We have employed the epistemological shift with institutional ethnography that centers knowledge production on empirically tracing people's difficult experiences within the institutions they traverse, rather than looking to the people themselves (Deveau, 2009; Sinding, 2010) . This influenced our approach to begin by understanding participants' accounts of difficulty with health care via interviews before looking beyond any one account to link these experiences with what happened at the institutional level. One influence in the development of institutional ethnography has been Foucault's use of discourse (Foucault, 1980) . This influence guided our pursuit to understand how discursive knowledge informs, constrains, and shapes the way that people think about and experience particular phenomena (Wetherell et al., 2003) .",

I don't like getting out of the realm of human-rights.\" The term \"mutilation\" therefore allowed participants to advocate for \"humanrights,\" but also distinguished women with female genital cutting from those \"outside\" who were not \"mutilated.\"",
