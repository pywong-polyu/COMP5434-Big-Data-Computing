            "text": "As prospects for eradicating CoV-2 dwindle, we are faced with the question of how the 10 severity of CoV-2 disease may change in the years ahead. Will CoV-2 continue to be a 11 pathogenic scourge that, like smallpox or measles, can be tamed only by ongoing vaccina-12 tion, or will it join the ranks of mild endemic human coronaviruses (HCoVs)? Our analysis 13 of immunological and epidemiological data on HCoVs shows that infection-blocking immu-14 nity wanes rapidly, but disease-reducing immunity is long-lived. We estimate the relevant 15 parameters and incorporate them into a new epidemiological model framework which sep-16 arates these different components of immunity. Our model recapitulates both the current 17 severity of CoV-2 and the relatively benign nature of HCoVs; suggesting that once the 18 endemic phase is reached, CoV-2 may be no more virulent than the common cold. The 19 benign outcome at the endemic phase is contingent on the virus causing primary infections 20 in children. We predict a very different outcome were a CoV like MERS (that causes severe 21 disease in children) to become endemic. These results force us to re-evaluate control mea-22 sures that rely on identifying and isolating symptomatic infections, and reconsider ideas 23 regarding herd immunity and the use of immune individuals as shields to protect vulnerable 24 groups.",

            "text": "Emerging pathogens have been invading the human host niche through history (such as 27 smallpox emerging from an ancestral animal pox virus and rinderpest evolving to measles) 28 to kill a substantial fraction of all people born. Recent decades have seen multiple chal-29 lenges that cause severe viral disease, such as SARS, MERS, Hendra, Nipha and Ebola. 30 Fortunately, all these are examples of emerging diseases that were locally contained. When 31 containment is not successful, as is likely for the novel betacoronavirus SARS CoV-2 (CoV- 32 2) [1, 2] , we need to understand and plan for the transition to endemicity and continued 33 circulation, with possible changes in disease severity due to virus evolution and build-up 34 of host immunity and resistance. 35 COVID-19 is an emerging infectious disease caused by CoV-2 that has a high basic re-36 productive number (R 0 ) and significant transmission during the asymptomatic phase, both 37 of which make it hard to control [3] . However, CoV-2 is not the first coronavirus identified 38 with human-to-human transmission: there are six other coronaviruses with known human 39 chains of transmission, and these can provide clues to future scenarios for the current pan-40 demic. There are four human coronaviruses (HCoVs) that circulate endemically across the 41 globe; they cause only mild symptoms and are not a significant public health burden [4] . 42 Another two HCoV strains, SARS CoV-1 and MERS, emerged in the past few decades 43 and had higher case fatality ratios (CFRs) than COVID-19 but were contained and never 44 spread widely [5, 6] . 45 We propose a model to explore the potential changes in both transmission and disease 46 severity of emerging HCoVs through the transition to endemicity. We focus on CoV-2, and 47 discuss how the conclusions would differ for emerging coronaviruses more akin to SARS and 48 MERS. Our hypothesis is that all HCoVs elicit immunity with similar characteristics, and 49 the current acute public health problem is a consequence of epidemic emergence into an 50 immunologically naive population in which frail age-groups have no previous exposure. We 51 use our estimates of immunological and epidemiological parameters for endemic HCoVs to 52 develop a quantitative transmission model and incorporate the age-dependence of severity 53 from primary infections of emerging HCoVs. Our model explicitly considers three separate 54 measures of the efficacy of immunity which can wane at different rates. These novel features 55 allow us new insights into potential changes in both transmission and disease severity in 56 the coming years (Fig 1) . 57 Building on ideas from the vaccine modeling literature, immunity may be thought to 58 provide protection in three ways [7] . In its most robust form, \"sterilizing\" immunity can 59 prevent a pathogen from replicating, thereby rendering the host refractory to reinfection. 60 We term this property immune efficacy with respect to susceptibility, IE S . If immunity 61 does not prevent reinfection, it may still attenuate the pathology due to reinfection (IE P ) 62 and/or reduce transmissibility or infectiousness (IE I ). Experimental re-exposure studies 63 on endemic HCoVs provide evidence that the three IE's do not wane at the same rate 64 [8, 9] . Callow's experimental study [8] shows that reinfection is possible within one year (relatively short IE S ); however, upon reinfection symptoms are mild (high IE P ) and the 66 virus is cleared more quickly (moderate IE I ). Details the derivation of the model are in SI 67 section 2. 68 3 Results 69 3.1 Endemic dynamics and age structure 70 We use available data on age-specific seroprevalence of IgM (acute response) and IgG 71 (long-term memory) against the four circulating HCoVs to estimate parameter ranges for 72 transmission and waning of immunity [10] . The data are plotted and further analyzed infected so early in life -younger even than measles in the pre-vaccine era -there must be 78 a very high attack rate, too high to be due only to transmission from primary infections. 79 Steady state analysis of the model shows how this attack rate arises from a combination 80 of high transmissibility from primary infections (i.e., high R 0 ) and waning of sterilizing 81 immunity and significant transmission from reinfections in older individuals. The rapid 82 waning of sterilizing immunity is also documented in experimental HCoV infections of 83 humans which showed that reinfection is possible one year after an earlier infection, albeit 84 with milder symptoms (IE P ) and a shorter duration (IE I ) [11] . Figure 2B shows the 85 plausible combinations of waning immunity and transmission from reinfected individuals 86 that is required to produce the MAPI observed in Figure 2A . Table 1 shows the ranges of 87 the parameters used in our simulations. At the beginning of an outbreak, the age distribution of cases mirrors that of the population 90 ( Fig 3A) . Once the demographics of infection reaches a steady state, however primary 91 cases occur almost entirely in babies and young children, who in the case of COVID-92 19, experience a low CFR. Reinfections in older individuals are predicted to be common 93 and contribute to transmission, but in this steady-state population, older individuals, who 94 would be at risk for severe disease from a primary infection, have acquired disease-reducing 95 immunity following infection during childhood.",

Were a more pathogenic emerging 112 coronavirus to become endemic, for example one with an age-dependent CFR similar to 113 CoV-1, we still expect a low disease burden in the long run (Fig 4) . However, data suggest 114 not all emerging HCoVs follow this optimistic pattern; the overall CFR of an endemic 115 MERS-like virus would increase during the transition to endemicity because disease severity 116 is high in children, the age group expected to experience the bulk of primary cases during 117 the endemic phase. The key result from our new model framework that explicitly recognizes that functional 120 immunity to reinfection, disease and shedding are different is that, in contrast with in-121 fections that are severe in childhood, CoV-2 could join the ranks of mild, cold-causing 122 endemic human coronaviruses in the long run. A critical prediction is that the severity of 123 emergent CoVs once they reach endemicity depends only on the severity of primary infec-124 tion in children (Fig 4) because all available evidence suggests immunity to HCoVs has 125 short IE S , moderate IE I but strong IE P such that childhood infection provides protection 126 from pathology upon reinfection in adulthood. Strain-specific virulence factors, such as 127 the shared cellular receptor, ACE-2, to which CoV-1, CoV-2 and the endemic strain NL63 128 all bind [18, 19, 20, 21] , may affect the CFR during the emergence phase but have little 129 impact on the severity of disease in the endemic phase. Because the four endemic HCoVs 130 have been globally circulating for a long time and almost everyone is infected at a young 131 age, we cannot ascertain how much pathology would result from a primary case of any of 132 these in an elderly person.",

Panel A. The black line representing the number of infections per day shows an initial peak and subsequent transition to endemic dynamics with much lower numbers of infections (with the endemic dynamics from years 5 to 10 shown in the inset). The three plots in A show that a higher R 0 results in a larger and faster initial epidemic and more rapid transition to endemic dynamics. We also show (on the same plot) how the proportion of primary cases in different age groups changes over time (plotted in different colors), and how the transition from epidemic to endemic dynamics results in primary cases being restricted to the lower age groups. Parameters for simulations: \u03c9 = 1 and \u03c1 = 0.7. In Panel B, we plot how long it takes for the average CFR (calculated as a 6 month moving average) to fall to 0.001, the CFR associated with seasonal influenza. Grey areas represent simulations where the CFR did not reach 0.001 within ten years. We see that the time taken for the CFR to decline to that of influenza decreases as the transmissibility (R 0 ) increases and the duration of sterilizing immunity becomes shorter.

Panel B shows how the overall CFR (computed from modelpredicted infections in each age group multiplied by the age-specific CFRs for the different CoVs) changes with the transition from epidemic to endemic dynamics.

The details of the 143 change in overall CFR through the transient period will be impacted by a wide array of 144 factors, such as age-specific human contact rates [22] and susceptibility to infection [23], 145 as well as improvement in treatment protocols, hospital capacity, and virus evolution. The 146 qualitative result of mild disease in the endemic phase is robust to these complexities, but 147 quantitative predictions for the transient phase will depend on a careful consideration of 148 these realities and how they interact with the dynamics of infection and components of 149 immunity. 150 The changes in the CFR over time predicted by the model have implications for vacci-151 nation strategy against current and future emerging HCoVs. The widespread (pandemic) 152 circulation of any novel pathogenic HCoV will invariably require rapid generation and de-153 ployment of a vaccine. In the longer term, however, the necessity for continual vaccination 154 will depend on the age-dependence of the CFR. If primary infections of children are mild 155 (CoV-1 and CoV-2), continued vaccination may not be needed as primary cases recede to 156 mild childhood sniffles. If, on the other hand, primary infection is severe in children (as 157 for MERS), then vaccination of children will need to be continued. 158 Our model provides strategic insights into plausible transitions from pandemic to en-159 demic dynamics for CoV-2, which have implications for control measures during a likely 160 high-CFR transient period.

Using data published byZhou et al (2013) [10], we plotted the mean proportion seropositive for IgG (green, top lines) and IgM (purple, bottom lines) against the four endemic HCoV strains (dots connected by dashed lines) along with the 95% CIs for the proportions (vertical lines going through each dot). Additionally, we calculate the mean age of primary infection (MAPI) based on the IgM data, and show the mean and its 95% CI in text inside each panel (see SI for details). Panel B. We plot how the MAPI depends on the rate of waning of sterilizing immunity (\u03c9, on the y-axis) and the relative transmissibility of reinfections (compared with primary infections) (\u03c1, on the x-axis). The MAPI was calculated from the equilibrium dynamics of the model shown inFig 1 andSI Eqns 3-9 with a plausible basic reproductive number (R 0 =5) and 0 < \u03c9 < 2 (i.e., sterilizing immunity is as short as \u2265 0.5 yr) and 0 < \u03c1 < 1 (i.e., reinfections transmit less than primary infections). See SI Sec 2.1 for details. The white band in Panel B indicates the plausible combinations of values of \u03c1 and \u03c9 consistent with the MAPI for HCoVs estimated in Panel A. If additionally we restrict the duration of sterilizing immunity to at most two years (\u03c9 > 0.5, plot area above the black line in Panel B), then the plausible range for the relative transmissibility of reinfections is 0.14 < \u03c1 < 0.23.
