Our aim is to explore creativity, understood to involve novelty and acceptability, from a quantitative perspective. The results show that HT has the highest creativity score, followed by PE, and lastly, MT, and this is unanimous from all reviewers. A neural MT system trained on literary data does not currently have the necessary capabilities for a creative translation; it renders literal solutions to translation problems. More importantly, using MT to post-edit raw output constrains the creativity of translators, resulting in a poorer translation often not fit for publication, according to experts.",

Experts tend to locate the starting point at Guilford's keynote speech at the 1950 annual meeting of the American Psychological Association (Guilford 1950) . Since then the discipline has flourished (Runco 2014) , and there is now a consensus that creativity \"requires both originality and effectiveness\" (Runco and Jaeger 2012, 93) or \"something novel and appropriate, from a person, a group or a society\" (Sawyer 2006, 33) . This implies that for something to be labelled as creative, it needs to be new (even if it involves the reshaping of an existing object or idea), but it also has to be of value for the context in which it is created (there is an element of practicality, although this is not always a prerequisite).",

Rojo explains that \"creative solutions have to be novel and depart from conventional translation behaviour, but should also render meaning accurately and give solutions appropriate to a certain textual, situational and cultural context\" (Rojo 2017, 353) . Bayer-Hohenwarter and Kussmaul (2020, 312) explain that \"a creative translation is a translation that often involves changes (as a result of shifts) when compared to the source text, thereby bringing something that is new and also appropriate to the task that was set, i.e. to the translation assignment (to purpose)\". Kussmaul (1995) , based on psychology studies, applies a four-phase model to the creative process: A) preparation related to the comprehension of the ST, B) incubation related to the search for ideas in the known world, C) illumination related to the production of these ideas, and D) evaluation related to the revision of the ideas. These phases do not necessarily occur in sequential order.",

They use two methods, error categorization by means of an error taxonomy and computational linguistics analysis: lexical richness, local cohesion, syntactic and stylistic differences. The encouraging results show that 44% of the sentences do not contain errors. As a follow up to this study, Webster et al. (2020) look at the translation of four classic novels from English to Dutch using GT and DeepL. Their results are less optimistic than previous results with only 23 % (GT) and 21% (DeepL) of sentences found to be without errors.

We selected an intriguing story by Kurt Vonnegut: 3 2BR02B. It was first published in 1962 in the magazine Worlds of If Science Fiction and was later included in the collection Bagombo Snuff Box (Vonnegut 1999) . This science fiction story is set in a futuristic world where death has been eradicated and people live forever, the only caveat is that for one person that is born, another one must die. Vonnegut centres the story on several characters, a father to be, a doctor, a government official, a hospital orderly and a painter. These characters exemplify different attitudes towards the world they are immersed in.",

Figure 1 shows the HTER results in boxplots according to the modality (PE and HT) and the languages involved (CA and NL) using NMT as the hypothesis. 16 but also that the NL translation is always closer to the MT output, especially for the PE modality. To see this in more detail, For PE, CA translators made more changes than their NL counterparts, with T4's PE being the closest to the MT proposal. This is interesting since both NL translators (T3 and T4) rated the MT output the lowest, yet still they made fewer changes during PE. A possible explanation is that, since they were new to the PE task, they might have felt that they had to preserve more of the NMT output resulting in an increased level of frustration and lower ratings of the output. The data also indicates that the quality of the output is not suitable for production (Schmidtke and Groves 2019) and that even using a customized and improved NMT engine for CA, the HTER results are higher for the PE modality than in our previous study (Guerberof-Arenas and Toral 2020).

From the data analysed herein, it appears that using MT (by means of PE) hinders the effectiveness of the translation process, because the translator becomes the evaluator and not the creator, and therefore the mechanisms and phases of creativity are not set into motion. To see if the reader experience is indeed altered, the second part of our project will explore the reader experience of these modalities.",

The annotators identified the same 77 units (41.62 %), and 108 different units. Since translation problems could be different depending on the language and the annotator criteria, it was decided to aggregate them, thus there were 185 UCPs in total (out of 123 paragraphs). Novelty The reviewers were instructed to classify the UCPs in the target texts (TTs) in a spreadsheet especially created for the project.

Since the sample is small, general conclusions cannot be drawn, but it helps to understand our dataset and the subsequent results on creativity.other research in creative text shows that a reduction in keystrokes does not necessarily mean a reduction in time or effort(Koponen et al. 2020). The explanation for this can be manifold: the language combination, the type of text, the MT engine, and the number and type of participants. NLPE M= 11.22). This data seems to indicate that translating was more cognitively demanding for translators than PE. In PE research, a lower cognitive effort is perceived as an indicator that MT has helped translators to reduce their effort. However, we",
