Despite the significant amount of available information, infectious disease physicians are requested to solve questions from colleagues, patients, and relatives on a daily basis. Here, we aim to describe the evidence supporting the answers for frequently asked questions, based on a literature review. We created a web-based questionnaire which was distributed to a group of 70 infectious disease specialists and medical residents, asking what questions and issues they most frequently faced. The 10 most frequent questions guided the topics for a narrative review. We provide evidence and consensus-based information on subjects such as infection and transmission, isolation, management of COVID-19 confirmed cases, reinfection, clinical-therapeutic management, vaccination, and antibodies post-infection/vaccination. Correctly clarifying doubts and providing clear information to physicians, patients, and family members helps to better manage COVID-19 in the community and the hospital settings.",

Viral RNA is detected in the respiratory tract 1-3 days before the onset of symptoms, reach a peak at symptom onset, and decrease over the following 7-8 days in most subjects. 2, 3 In stool samples, this viral load appears to peak in the second week of illness, but without correlation with infectivity. 4, 5 According to most studies that performed viral cultures to identify its replicative capacity, viable viruses were not obtained on days 7 6 and 8 7 after the onset of symptoms in mild to moderate cases. Severely ill and immunosuppressed patients may maintain viral shedding for at least 10 to 20 days. 2, 4, 8 However, most of these individuals (88% to 95%) had no replicating virus after 15 days and virtually none have been detected after three weeks. 2, 8 Therefore, according to CDC 4 and WHO 9 guidelines, as a general rule, RT-PCR testing is not recommended to determine the end of isolation. A symptom-based strategy should be preferred to a test-based strategy. Definitions of disease severity categories are based on the National Institutes of Health (NIH) COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines. 10 The highest level of disease severity experienced by the patient at any point in their clinical course should be used to determine the duration of transmission-based precautions.

            "text": "Both WHO 9 and CDC 12 recommend that additional care should be taken when interpreting negative results. If there is a higher level of clinical or epidemiological suspicion for SARS-CoV-2 infection, consider maintaining transmission-based precautions and perform a second test for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. 11 Antigenic tests are as specific as RT-PCR but can be less sensitive. 12 In these cases, a lower respiratory tract sample could be collected before a decision is made to discontinue empiric precautions. 6 Moreover, adjuvant investigations, in particular, computed tomography (CT) of the chest, can further contribute to case detection, in the presence of lower respiratory symptoms. Serological testing is unlikely to be useful in the diagnosis of acute infection. It should be reserved for situations where the duration of symptoms is prolonged, the RT-PCR is persistently negative, but clinical suspicion of COVID-19 remains high. 13 If a patient with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection is never tested, the decision to discontinue transmission-based precautions can be made using the symptom-based strategy described above. 4, 9 As of July 2021, WHO has characterized four variants of concern (VOC): Alpha from VOC to variants being monitored (VBM), based on significant and sustained reduction in national and regional proportions. 14 The emergence of new VOC and also the VBM is a major threat worldwide. 9 There is some evidence of increased transmissibility, more severe illness (e.g., increase hospitalizations or deaths), a significant reduction in neutralization antibodies titers generated during previous infection or vaccination, reduced efficacy of treatments or vaccines, and possible diagnostic detection failures. 14 The RT-PCR for COVID-19 diagnosis uses two to three RNA gene targets to increase sensitivity, for example, nucleocapsid (N), envelope (env), spike (S), RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), and ORF1 genes, especially with the advent of VOC/VBM. 15 At present, there is no evidence of change in shedding duration or laboratory misdiagnosing with the advent of VOC/VBM. 12, 15 3) How long can PCR for SARS-CoV-2 remain detectable in the course of infection?

Either LMWH or a direct oral anticoagulant (i.e., rivaroxaban or betrixaban) can be used. The duration of postdischarge thromboprophylaxis in these cases can be approximately 14 days at least and up to 30 days. 37, 39, 40 Table 3 summarizes the main thromboprophylaxis recommendations from WHO, 25 NIH, 39 and ISTH. 40 For hospitalized COVID-19 patients who experience rapid deterioration of pulmonary, cardiac, or neurological function, or of a sudden loss of peripheral perfusion, the possibility of thromboembolic disease should be evaluated and a therapeutic anticoagulation regimen considered if there is low risk for bleeding. 39, 40 Patients with COVID-19 who experience an incident VTE or who are highly suspected to have VTE should be managed with therapeutic doses of anticoagulant therapy such as enoxaparin 1 mg/kg twice daily. The duration of treatment should be at least three months. 37 The NICE guidelines on COVID-19 management 26 updated some information about noncritically ill patients, based on a recently released RCT 42 to -Consider a treatment dose of LMWH for adults who need low-flow oxygen and who do not have an increased bleeding risk, for 14 days or until discharge, whichever is sooner.

[44] [45] [46] Despite not evaluating the cellular immune response of T cells and memory B cells, these data demonstrate that SAR-CoV-2 infection probably does not produce a definitive and humoral long-lasting immunity in all people. 47 The cases of SARS-CoV-2 reinfection may be associated with the absence of neutralizing serologic titers, decreased immunoglobulin titers after primoinfection, or viral polymorphisms that evade the host immune response. SAR-CoV-2 reinfection is still considered a rare event if we consider studies conducted in 2020 and the case reports described so far in the literature. [48] [49] [50] However, there is currently concern about reinfection risk in cases where the new infection is due to a VOC/VBM or in the case of immunosuppressed individuals. 51 In case of reinfection, the individual can probably still be able to transmit to susceptible contacts, develop symptomatic conditions, even with greater severity than the first infection. 48, 52, 53 The official definitions of reinfection from WHO, 54 CDC, 55 and ECDC 56 are shown in Table 4 .",

[66] [67] [68] It is important to note that the available vaccines have satisfactory vaccine effectiveness (VE) for the prevention of symptomatic or asymptomatic infections. A retrospective cohort BNT162b2 mRNA (Pfizer-BioNTech) vaccine study conducted with 6, 710 health care workers at a tertiary hospital in Israel estimated a VE of 97% for symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection and 86% for asymptomatic ones. 69 With similar results, a case-control study with Pfizer-BioNTech and mRNA-1273 (Moderna) vaccines among health care workers in the USA established a VE of 94%. 70 The effectiveness demonstrated in these studies would be with full schedule vaccination of two doses since it was 82% with one dose in the latter. 70 Another case-control study was made in the UK with 156,930 adults aged 70 years and older with the objective to estimate the effect of vaccination with Pfizer-BioNTech and ChAdOx1-S (Fiocruz/AstraZeneca) vaccines on confirmed symptomatic COVID-19.",

Most guidelines do not recommend for or against the use of high-titer COVID-19 convalescent plasma for the treatment of COVID-19. Future trials should attempt to compare outcomes of convalescent plasma given in this optimal setting to the standard of care.[23][24][25][26] Immunoglobulin: the guidelines recommend against the use of non-SARS-CoV-2specific intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) for the treatment of COVID-19, except in a clinical trial.[23][24][25][26] A prospective randomized trial28 showed that intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) significantly improved hypoxia and reduced hospital length of stay and progression to mechanical ventilation in COVID-19; however, methylprednisolone was provided with each IVIg dose in the treatment arm, and cointerventions provided during the treatment period were unbalanced. Studies are needed to determine if there may be a role for IVIg in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2. 23,24,28 IVIg has been used in pediatric patients with COVID-19 and multiorgan inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C), especially those with a Kawasaki disease-like manifestation, but the efficacy of IVIg in the management of MIS-C is still under investigation. 23-25 Monoclonal antibodies: Anti-SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal antibodies that target the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and block virus entry into cells have been evaluated for the treatment of COVID-19. They are bamlanivimab plus etesevimab, casirivimab plus imdevimab, and sotrovimab. There are no comparative data to determine whether there are differences in clinical efficacy or safety between them. 23,24,26 Some circulating VOC/VBM have reduced susceptibility to one or more monoclonal antibodies. Most are authorized for the treatment of non-hospitalized patients, with mild to moderate COVID-19, or hospitalized for a reason other than COVID-19, who are at high risk of progression to severe COVID-19. 23,24,26 Treatment should be started as soon as possible after the patient receives a positive result on a SARS-CoV-2 antigen or nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) and within 10 days of symptom onset. Recently, the combination of casirivimab plus imdevimab was indicated for post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) of SARS-CoV-2 infection for individuals with a high risk of progression to serious COVID-19, not fully vaccinated or with impaired immune response.23,24 Tocilizumab: This is a monoclonal anti-IL-6-receptor blocking antibody. In hospitalized COVID-19 patients, administered with corticosteroids, tocilizumab offers a mortality benefit.23,24,26 Randomized controlled trials (RCT) reported a benefit if treatment was initiated early (randomization at the median of two to three days of hospitalization or < 24 hours in the ICU), suggesting tocilizumab may be more beneficial in people with early rapidly progressive disease.29,30 The guidelines recommend using tocilizumab (single intravenous [IV] dose of 8 mg/kg actual body weight up to 800 mg) in combination with dexamethasone (6 mg daily for up to 10 days) in certain hospitalized patients with progressive severe or critical COVID-19 and with elevated inflammatory markers, as a requirement of invasive mechanical ventilation, noninvasive ventilation, or high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) oxygen (>0.4",

It is important to consider that anticoagulant regimens should not change to a treatment-dose regimen based solely on D-dimer levels without established VTE.37,39,40 Intermediate doses LMWH may also be considered in some situations, although a recent randomized trial advised that intermediate-dose prophylactic anticoagulation, compared with standarddose prophylactic anticoagulation, did not result in a significant difference in venous or arterial thrombosis.41 VTE prophylaxis recommendations should be modified based on extremes of body weight, severe thrombocytopenia (i.e., platelet counts of 50 000 \u00d7 10 9 /L or 25 000 \u00d7 10 9 /L), or deteriorating renal function.40",
