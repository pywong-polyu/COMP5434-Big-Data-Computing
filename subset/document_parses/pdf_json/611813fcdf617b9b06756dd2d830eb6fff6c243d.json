Here, we report that COVID-19-induced oxidative stress inflicts structural damages to HSA and is linked with mortality outcome in critically ill patients. We recruited 39 patients who were followed up for a median of 12.5 days (1-35 days), among them 23 had died. Analyzing blood samples from patients and healthy individuals (n=11), we provide evidence that neutrophils are major sources of oxidative stress in blood and that hydrogen peroxide is highly accumulated in plasmas of non-survivors. We then analyzed electron paramagnetic resonance spectra of spin-labeled fatty acids (SLFAs) bound with HSA in whole blood of control, survivor, and non-survivor subjects (n=10-11). Non-survivors' HSA showed dramatically reduced protein packing order parameter, faster SLFA correlational rotational time, and smaller S/W ratio (strong-binding/weak-binding sites within HSA), all reflecting remarkably fluid protein microenvironments. Following loading/unloading of 16-DSA, we show that the transport function of HSA may be impaired in severe patients. Stratified at the means, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis indicated that lower values of S/W ratio and accumulated H 2 O 2 in plasma significantly predicted in-hospital mortality (S/W\u22640.15, 81.8% (18/22) vs. S/W>0.15, 18.2% (4/22), p=0.023; plasma [H 2 O 2 ]>8.6 \u03bcM, 65.2% (15/23) vs. 34.8% (8/23), p=0.043). When we combined these two parameters as the ratio ((S/W)/[H 2 O 2 ]) to derive a risk score, the resultant risk score lower than the mean (<0.019) predicted mortality with high fidelity (95.5% (21/22) vs. 4.5% (1/22), log-rank \u03c7 2 =12.1, p=4.9\u00d710 \u22124 ). The derived parameters may provide a surrogate marker to assess new candidates for COVID-19 treatments targeting HSA replacements and/or oxidative stress.",

            "text": "COVID-19 pandemic continues as a global health crisis while the underlying SARS-CoV-2 virus defies all attempted treatment strategies. While writing this report, there have been more than 135 million confirmed cases including around 3 million deaths worldwide according to the World Health Organization Coronavirus Disease Dashboard (https:// covid19. who. int/). Although 50% of cases are reported to be in the 25-64 age group, the percentage of deaths increases dramatically with age, and approximately 75% of deaths are in those aged 65 years and above Hospitalization and Death by Age | CDC). People in the age groups 30-39 years, 40-49 years, and 50-64 years are 4, 10, and 30 times more likely to die from COVID-19 complications compared to the 18-29 years age group. Nevertheless, molecular and cellular factors contributing to mortality outcome in a homogeneous cohort of patients are not yet clear. Lack of diagnostic markers that predict mortality in COVID-19 patients impedes current efforts to siege the pandemic. It is thus critical to identify prognostic tests that can assess the risk of death in critically ill patients to guide clinical protocols and prioritize interventions. Furthermore, mechanistic clues for determining the underlying molecular factors contributing to the hypercoagulability, inflammation, and cytokine storm have been so far illusive. It is therefore imperative to intensify efforts focusing on understanding the molecular pathophysiology of COVID-19 infection and to identify prognostic markers to guide and prioritize clinical decisions.",

            "text": "Human serum albumin (HSA) is the most abundant constituent of soluble proteins in the circulatory system. HSA has been suggested and used as a diagnostic and prognostic marker of numerous diseases and conditions including ischemia, rheumatoid arthritis, cancer, septic shock, among many others. In addition to its numerous physiological and pharmacological functions including the maintenance of blood/tissue osmotic balance (Singh-Zocchi et al., 1999) , blood pH, metal cation transport and homeostasis (Bal et al., 2013; Stewart et al., 2003) , nutrients and drug shuttling (Fujiwara and Amisaki, 2013; Wishart et al., 2018) , and toxin neutralization (Ascenzi et al., 2006; Vorum and Honor\u00e9, 1996) , HSA is suggested to be a major circulating antioxidant (Cha and Kim, 1996; Loban et al., 1997) . HSA can remarkably bind with a diverse array of drugs and toxins thus controlling their bioavailability and pharmacologic effects (Fasano et al., 2005) . It has been previously shown that more than 70% of the free radical-trapping capacity of serum was due to HSA (reviewed in Roche et al., 2008) . Importantly, several reports indicated that inflammation enhances vascular permeability of various tissues to HSA apparently to confer antioxidant beneficial effects against reactive species released by activated neutrophils (Cross et al., 1994; Halliwell, 1988; Sitar et al., 2013) . Although currently without direct experimental evidence, neutrophilia-mediated oxidative stress was implicated in the COVID-19 pathology and speculated to exacerbate the inflammatory immune response eventually causing multi-organ failure and death (Laforge et al., 2020) . We hypothesized that COVID-19-mediated oxidative stress may be differentially reflected in HSA's structure and functions and employed electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spin labeling spectroscopy to explore HSA's structural changes in correlation with severity and mortality of critically ill COVID-19 patients.",

This approach relies on the well-studied ability of albumin to strongly and exclusively bind with fatty acids in blood. Albumin has at least seven different specific binding sites for long-chain fatty acids located in different domains within the protein (Bhattacharya et al., 2000; Curry et al., 1999; Simard et al., 2006) . Effectively, structural and functional changes in HSA may be assessed through the detection of parallel changes in mobility and binding affinity of SLFAs, in addition to the distribution of the spin labels on the albumin molecule (Haeri et al., 2019) . EPR spectra of spin labels bound to different domains of the protein provide information on the local fatty acids/protein interactions, which may probe changes in the overall structure of the protein under unfolding or damaging conditions ( Figure 1A ; Bhattacharya et al., 2000) . Here, we compare changes that occur to the mobility, binding affinity, and distribution of the HSA-bound SLFA in whole blood and plasma from COVID-19 patients in critical care unit relative to those observed in normal healthy individuals.

Our hypothesis implicates elevated oxidative stress as a major cause of HSA damage in severe COVID-19 patients. As a result, we started by following the dependence of clinical outcomes and mortality on ROS levels in blood cells. First, we used flow cytometry to assess percentages of neutrophils, lymphocytes, and platelets in all patients as described in Materials and methods ( Figure 2A) . Furthermore, we used the ROS-sensitive DCF dye to probe intracellular ROS levels in various cell populations in whole blood from all groups. Figure 2 shows that while lymphocyte counts decrease, a parallel dramatic increase in neutrophil counts (% total) was observable when going from Control (40.78\u00b114.0, n=9) to Sev-R (64.0\u00b120.0, n=10) to Sev-D (76.4\u00b1 6.8, n=11) groups (overall ANOVA p=3.9\u00d710 -5 ). Similar trend was clearly seen in the heat map depicting parameters for all patients analyzed by flow cytometry ( Figure 2B ). It is also clear from Figure 2B&C that changes in DCF-positive neutrophils follow similar trend observed for neutrophil counts. To confirm this relation, we compared neutrophil counts with DCF-positive neutrophil counts and found that the two parameters were strongly correlated (Pearson's r=0.8, p=3\u00d710 -7 ; Figure 2C ). Moreover, both parameters individually showed statistically significant increases in both of the studied COVID-19 groups when compared with the control group ( Figure 2D&E ). These results suggest that neutrophils are major sources of elevated oxidative stress in critically ill patients. Note that the observed trends in platelets, lymphocyte, neutrophils, and NLR are similar to reported values (Sun et al., 2020; Yang et al., 2020) .",

Hydrogen peroxide is the most stable ROS and is highly stable under prolonged storage at low temperatures. We used a highly specific catalasebased assay that we developed and verified in our laboratory to quantify [H 2 O 2 ] in plasma samples of all groups. The assay relies on high-resolution detection and quantification of released oxygen due to hydrogen peroxide decompostion by catalase ( Figure 3A&B ). We constructed a calibration curve to confirm the catalase-mediated H 2 O 2 to O 2 stoichiometric conversion ( Figure 3B) . A linear relation was obtained with zero intercept and slope of 0.47\u00b10.03 which closely matches the theoretically expected value of 0.5 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.37-0.56, p=5.6\u00d710 -4 , Pearson's r=0.994). Indeed, we detected striking differences between groups even with relatively small sample sizes (Mean \u00b1 SD, Control, n=11: 2.95\u00b10.77, Sev-R, n=16: 7.21\u00b12.4, Sev-D, n=23: 9.67\u00b12.0; overall ANOVA p=2.6\u00d710 -11 ; Figure 3C ). To confirm this finding, we performed DCF fluorescence imaging on freshly isolated neutrophils of representative group of individuals from each group ( Figure 3D) . We simultaneously stained neutrophils' nuclei with Hoechst 33342 (blue stain) to follow nuclear morphologic changes and DNA diffusion in all groups. Although requiring more detailed studies, a closer look at the acquired images of insufficient sample size or processing errors. (C) A diagram showing statistically positive correlation between neutrophil count and count of neutrophils stained positive for DCF dye in all groups (black dots denote controls; blue are Sev-R; and red represent Sev-D patients). (D) When neutrophil counts were compared for all groups, both Sev-R and Sev-D groups showed statistically significant neutrophilia relative to control groups. However, only a weak trend has been observed when comparing the two groups with COVID-19. (E) DCF staining revealed increased levels of ROS in Sev-R and Sev-D groups relative to control neutrophils. Sev-D showed a trend of increased ROS level relative to Sev-R group. Multiple comparisons were carried out using ANOVA followed by Tukey test and p values are given. ROS, reactive oxygen species.",

Catalase was used to specifically and quantitatively determine levels of hydrogen peroxide in identical plasma volumes collected from control (n=11), Sev-R (n=16), and Sev-D (n=23) groups. (A) Oxygen levels are monitored and recorded while 50 \u03bcl batches of plasma from control, Sev-R, and Sev-D subjects are sequentially infused into tightly air-controlled O2k chamber containing catalase (315 units/ml) in deoxygenated buffer. In addition to the initial rise due to residual oxygen in the added plasma samples, the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide in these samples produces oxygen quantitatively.

We employed EPR spectroscopy to probe SLFAs' binding statuses and protein configuration in all groups as detailed in the Materials and methods section above. Analysis of the 5-DSA and 16-DSA EPR spectra revealed remarkable changes in spectral features between control and COVID-19 groups ( Figure 4B and Figure 5 , 5-DSA; Figure 4 , 16-DSA in whole blood). For example, the hyperfine coupling tensor element 2T \u2016 (defined in Figure 1B and used to calculate the protein packing order parameter S) is sensitive to microenvironmental effects (such as polarity, H-bonding, electrostatic interactions, etc.) on the spin probe that is localized in one of the HSA native fatty acids binding pockets. Also, the S/W ratio (see Figure 1C ) corresponding to strongly bound/weakly bound populations of 16-DSA spin probe may reflect changes in protein folding that can alter protein-fatty acid interactions.

Calculated biophysical parameters including order parameter (D), rotational correlation time (E), and the ratio between strongly bound to weakly bound spin labels (S/W, F) as defined in Figure 1 and described in Materials and methods section. Statistical comparisons by ANOVA followed by Tukey tests were used for means' comparisons and revealed remarkable decrease in the binding strengths and packing parameter of the local microenvironment surrounding the spin labels. All calculated parameters along with exact p values are given in the Supplementary file 1.

In this paradigm, changes in the SLFA's lineshape are taken to indirectly display functional changes in the solution shape of albumin due to spatial rearrangements of paramagnetic centers in EPR-active, albumin-bound fatty acids. However, to confirm that the observed protein damages are indeed functional determinants for HSA, we performed additional experiments exploring albumin transport functions through loading/unloading of SLFA for representative sets of samples (n=3-5) from all of the studied groups. We argued that if the observed HSA structural damages are functionally relevant, they would affect the ability of HSA to load and dislodge fatty acids into and from their binding sites (Matthes et al., 2002) . To follow the fatty acid loading efficacy, we followed the apparent kinetics of 16-DSA's S ( Figure 5A ; strongly bound) and W ( Figure 5B ; weakly bound) peaks over 7 min immediately after mixing the spin label with identical plasma volumes from all groups.

Closer to the context of COVID-19 pathophysiology, critical roles of HSA have been suggested as it acts as an anti-inflammatory and antioxidant protein (Inoue et al., 2018) , anticoagulant agent (Doweiko and Nompleggi, 1991; Ronit et al., 2020) , inhibitor of oxidative stress-mediated clotting and platelet activation (Basili et al., 2019; Tian et al., 2020) , drug-dependent allosteric carrier and regulator (Fanali et al., 2012) , and a potent heme scavenger that may also exhibit globin-like reactivity (Ascenzi et al., 2015) . In the light of these established functions, it is natural to suggest albumin as a frontline protection against COVID-19-associated lethality resulting from cytokine storm, oxidative stress, blood clotting, and the ensuing organ failure. Although hypoalbuminemia has been repeatedly reported as a predictor of mortality in COVID-19 (Violi et al., 2020; Huang et al., 2020) , low albumin levels may result from surgery, dialysis, abdominal infections, liver failure, pancreatitis, respiratory distress, bypass surgery, ovarian problems caused by fertility drugs, and many other conditions. High prevalence of hypoalbuminemia in numerous disease states and the age/sex-dependent wide dynamic range of this protein concentration limits its diagnostic utility (Levitt and Levitt, 2016) . As a result, we investigated biophysical parameters pertaining to HSA protein structure in whole blood and plasma of all groups as reflectors of this critical protein functions.",

To avoid disparities related to clinical statuses and interventional protocols we restricted our subject recruitment to a homogeneous cohort of patients in terms of diseases severity, hospitalization, and interventions. Both sexes were represented in the overal COVID-19 subjects (40% females) and sex was not found to affect mortality. The mean age of the studied subjects was 66.7\u00b18.9 years (42-81), and non-survivors were slightly orlder. No other clinical or demographic characteristic showed statistically of oxidative stress as evident from the linear correlations between % DCF positive neutrophils and \u03c4 c (E) or S/W ratio (F). On each correlation, Pearson's r and exact p values are provided. Kaplan-Meier estimates of time-to-mortality from blood sample collection during ICU hospitalization (G-J). Log-rank Kaplan-Meier survival analyses were carried out to estimate the probability of survival of COVID-19 patients in relation to cutoff thresholds arbitrarily selected as the mean values of the analyzed parameters.

Our current data provide converging and novel evidence that neutrophils are major players in oxidative stress associating inflammation in critically ill COVID-19 patients, especially those that do not survive the infection. We detected increased neutrophil count, increased ROS-positive neutrophil population, increased intracellular ROS level in these neutrophils, and a remarkably elevated hydrogen peroxide residue in plasma of non-survivor COVID-19 patients relative to control and survivor groups. Moreover, these oxidative stress measures were found to strongly correlate with EPR-detected structural damages of HSA. We found that albumin levels were inversely associated with overall mortality, and that a biophysical measure of structural changes inflicted on albumin (S/W) can consistently predict overall mortality even with a relatively small n=38 sample size. Moreover, plasma levels of hydrogen peroxide were also found to predict in-ICU mortality (n=39). The current survival analysis reports event numbers in the range from 15 to 21 for various predictor parameters (see new Figure 6G -J) . This exceeds the current consensus that 10 or more events per predictor are sufficient to provide firm grounds for generalization of findings (Courvoisier et al., 2011; Kocak and Onar-Thomas, 2012; Ogundimu et al., 2016) . It is important to mention that the current work did not address important questions related to the enzymatic source of ROS and whether mitochondria contribute to the observed oxidative stress profiles in connection with infection severity and mortality.",

            "text": "Oxidative stress is commonly implicated in a plethora of diseases and was indeed suggested repeatedly; albeit with little experimental support, as the spearhead of inflammation leading to severe symptoms and sepsis-like fatal responses in critically ill COVID-19 patients (Laforge et al., 2020) . We suggest that HSA damage inflicted by neutrophil-mediated ROS bursts in those patients effectively contributes to the COVID-19 pathology. For instance, impairment of HSA ability to transport an extremely wide range of endogenous and exogenous ligands may affect the bioavailability of adminsitered drugs (Lee and Wu, 2015) , distribution of anti-inflammatory molecules such as NO and prostaglandins (Arroyo et al., 2014) , as well as affecting its anticoagulation and antiplatelet activation functions (Paar et al., 2017) . Reduced and damaged HSA may also disturb the vascular oncotic pressure contributing to pulmonary edema and potentially to gastrointestinal symptoms that characterize recent waves of the infection. Collectively, these factors constitute major players in the pathology triggered by SARS-CoV-2 viral infection. Although hypoalbuminemia is suggested as a pivotal marker for the pathology of many infections (reviewed very recently in Wiedermann, 2021) including in COVID-19 (Violi et al., 2020) , albumin damage has not been directly implicated in infectious disease to the best of our knowledge.",

These parameters were not statistically different when comparing survivors with non-survivors ( Table 2) . Nevertheless, obtained biophysical and biochemical parameters correlated reasonably well with severity and mortality. Our current findings substantiate the utilization of the identified parameters as accurate mortality predictors of critically ill COVID-19 patients. Determining threshold values of these parameters can possibly help to identify patients in need of urgent medical attention, and may provide novel markers to assess new candidates for COVID-19 treatments targeting HSA replacements. We thus suggest the importance of studying the potential effects of albumin replacement therapy on clinical outcomes of Covid-19 patients. Our results also provide new mechanistic insights into pathways that could be targeted to help prevent critical COVID illness and death, for example, oxidative stress.",

Distribution status of platelets, neutrophils, monocytes, and lymphocytes was measured in whole blood samples by 13-color flow cytometry as described using CytoFLEX system (Beckman Coulter Life Sciences CytoFLEX benchtop flow cytometer). Suspended cells were incubated with combinations of anti-human monoclonal antibodies for subset identification as follows: CD-42b-PE (Beckman Coulter Life Sciences, IM1417U) for platelets, CD14-PC7 (Beckman Coulter Life Sciences, A22331) for monocytes, CD66b-APC-Alexa Fluor 750 for neutrophils (Beckman Coulter Life Sciences, B08756), and CD3-ECD (Beckman Coulter Life Sciences, IM2705U) for lymphocytes cells were incubated for 30 min in the dark at room temperature.

Oxygen levels are monitored and recorded while 50 \u03bcl batches of plasma from control, Sev-R, and Sev-D subjects are sequentially infused into tightly air-controlled O2k chamber containing catalase (315 units/ml) in deoxygenated buffer. A continuous stream of pure nitrogen gas was blown over the chamber's sealing cap to prevent oxygen diffusion into the working solution. In addition to the initial rise due to residual oxygen in the added plasma samples, the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide in these samples produced oxygen in a quantitative manner, that is, decomposition of one mole of H 2 O 2 produced \u00bd-mole O 2 . To verify the assay, we measured the released oxygen upon adding increasing concentrations of standard hydrogen peroxide solution in PBS buffer. Linear fitting of the plotted [O 2 ] versus [H 2 O 2 ] relation yielded a slope=0.47\u00b10.03 (Pearson's r=0.994, p=5.6\u00d710 -4 ), which is very close to the theoretically expected value of 0.5.",

Data outliers were identified graphically through box plots and were only removed when confirmed through Grubbs's tests (OriginPro). For comparisons of means between three or more independent groups, Tukey test ANOVA for multiple comparison was performed. For correlation analysis, Spearman's rank correlation was performed. Pearson's correlation coefficient was calculated for measuring the association between variables of interest based on the method of covariance which also gives information about the magnitude of the association, or correlation, as well as the direction of the relationship. p-values<0.05 for correlations or means' comparisons were considered significant. Categorical variables are reported as counts and percentages while continuous variables are expressed as mean \u00b1 standard deviation. Differences between percentages were assessed by Pearson's \u03c7 2 tests or Fisher's exact tests when the number of observations per group was less than 5. The \u03c7 2 tests provided results that tested the hypothesis that the mortality and a given variable (e.g., sex or comorbidity) are independent. When p is less than the significant level of 0.05, there is significant evidence of association between mortality and the variable. Log-rank Kaplan-Meier survival analyses were carried out to estimate the probability of survival of COVID-19 patients in relation to cutoff thresholds arbitrarily stratified at mean values of various parameters. The log-rank test for trends reports a \u03c7 2 -value and computes a p value testing the null hypothesis that there is no linear trend between column order and median survival.",
