The aim of this study was to examine the associations of depression and anxiety with feelings of stigma among patients in Saudi Arabia who have recovered from COVID-19. Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted between July and December 2020. Trained healthcare providers contacted and interviewed participants by phone. Depression, anxiety, and stigma were assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), the Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) questionnaire, and the Explanatory Model Interview Catalogue stigma scale (EMIC). Data on sociodemographic characteristics, comorbidities, and family history of mental illness were also collected. Multiple linear regression models were performed to explore factors associated with depression and anxiety. Results: A total of 174 adult participants (\u226518 years old) who had recently recovered from COVID-19 were interviewed. The mean PHQ-9 and GAD-7 scores were 7.53 (\u00b15.04) and 3.77 (\u00b14.47), respectively. About 68% of the participants had at least mild depression (PHQ-9 score of 5-9), whereas only 29.89% had at least mild anxiety (GAD-7 score of 5-9) during their infections with COVID-19. Multiple linear regression showed that females were more vulnerable to depression and anxiety disorders than their male counterparts were (\u03b2=3.071 and \u03b2=1.86, respectively). Notably, participants' stigma scores were significantly associated with higher scores on depression and anxiety. Conclusion: These findings highlight the negative consequences of COVID-19 infection on the mental health of recovered patients. Therefore, considerable attention from local and international health authorities is needed to improve the mental well-being of recovered COVID-19 patients.",

            "text": "The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has had unprecedented detrimental effects on healthcare systems worldwide, resulting in physical and mental-health consequences, 1,2 which can be profound and long-lasting. 3 Moreover, COVID-19 has provoked fear of an imminent economic crisis and recession. 2 To prevent the spread of the virus, various preventive measures have been implemented, such as maintaining social distance, isolation, and movement restrictions. 4 However, these measures combined with the continuous spread of the virus have profoundly changed people's lifestyles and negatively affected their mental health and well-being. 5, 6 Several psychological and behavioral changes have been observed during this and previous outbreaks of infectious diseases and these behavioral changes have had critical effects on the dynamics of the outbreaks by altering the diseases' characteristics, such as level of severity, transmission, and consequences at the individual, national, and international levels. 7 For instance, during the Ebola outbreak, individuals were predicted to experience fear of suffering or having pain, dying, feeling hopeless, and being stigmatized by others. 8 Likewise, the COVID-19 pandemic has led to marked behavioral changes, which can lead to psychological disorders. 9 Health crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, have been associated with negative mental health outcomes among healthcare providers and the general population, which are often expressed as fear, anxiety, depression, and stigmatization. 10 Identifying these psychological changes and disorders in the early stages of a disease may result in the implementation of interventions that are more effective in containing the psychological consequences of pandemics. 10 Major depression is a prevalent and recurrent mood disorder associated with persistent feelings of sadness that leads to reduced productivity and quality of life and increased morbidity and mortality. 11, 12 It has been ranked by the World Health Organization as one of the main causes of disability worldwide and is projected to be the top leading cause of disability by 2030. 13, 14 Anxiety disorders refer to a group of psychiatric disorders that produce fear, worry, and a constant feeling of being overwhelmed. 15 In developing countries, approximately 10-44% of people experience symptoms of depression and anxiety, but less than 35% of them receive medical care. 16 The COVID-19 pandemic represents a significant threat to psychological well-being and could significantly increase the incidence rates of depression and anxiety. 17 A Chinese study found that approximately 20% of participants suffered from depressive symptoms and 35.1% from anxiety symptoms during the COVID-19 outbreak. 18 Similarly, an increased prevalence of depression and anxiety were reported among the general population in the United Kingdom during the COVID-19 pandemic. 19 Of equal importance, the experience of being stigmatized due to COVID-19 infection could lead to feelings of disgrace. 20 Previous studies have reported an association between mental disorders and stigmatizing attitudes. For instance, Ociskova et al found that patients with psychiatric disorders, including anxiety and depression, were at a higher risk for self-stigmatization and discrimination. 21 Another study found that having depression was significantly correlated with an increased level of perceived stigma. 22 The relationship between stigma and health has been investigated more than a hundred years ago. 23 Erving Goffman came up with the theoretical framework back in the late 1950s which laid out the relationship between stigma defined as a negative perception of the community toward certain individuals or group of people based on their social, physical, behavioral, or mental traits and mental illness in psychiatric hospitals. 24 This theory which then became known as benchmark social theory of the relationship between stigma and disease is now used to explain the relationship between different physical and mental diseases and stigma. 20 Undoubtedly, these negative and stigmatizing attitudes toward mental illness and people with psychiatric disorders are barriers to seeking help from healthcare professionals. 25 The psychological impact of COVID-19 on affected individuals is a concerning global health issue, and studies indicate that those individuals are at a high risk for adverse mental health outcomes. 26, 27 A meta-analysis of the epidemiologic studies that examined the prevalence of mental illness during the COVID-19 pandemic found that the infected patients, quarantined people, and patients with noncontagious chronic diseases were at greater risk for depression and anxiety compared to the rest of the population. 28 Another study revealed that patients with COVID-19 infection had higher rates of symptoms of depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder compared to their non-COVID-19 counterparts. 29 Multiple factors were found to be related to the mental health issues of these vulnerable individuals, including self-isolation, hospitalization, stigma, and discrimination accompanied by the absence of social support. [29] [30] [31] Moreover, individuals with a pre-existing or family history of mental illness were more likely to have adverse mental health outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic. 32, 33 There is a paucity of research addressing the impact of COVID-19 on mental health in Saudi Arabia. Although feelings of stigma have been investigated among patients in Saudi Arabia who have recovered from COVID-19, including whether they felt stigmatized by the people around them, no studies have examined the associations of depression and anxiety with stigma in this segment of the population. 33 Therefore, the aim of this study was to examine the association between depression/anxiety and stigma among patients with COVID-19 who had been infected with the disease and recovered from it during the COVID-19 pandemic in Saudi Arabia. study and asymptomatic patients were excluded. Participants were selected by a search query that retrieved random observations from the Ministry of Health (MoH) database of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection that was confirmed by a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test. They were contacted and interviewed over the phone by one of four trained healthcare providers. Additionally, they were informed about the purpose of the study and their consent was obtained verbally since no written informed consent form was required.",

The Arabic version of the PHQ-9 scale is a 9-item instrument that assesses the presence and severity of depression by asking respondents how much they were bothered by depression symptoms during the past two weeks. 35 The items' response options and their corresponding scores were: nearly every day (3), more than half of the days (2), several days (1), or not at all (0), yielding a total score ranging from 0 to 27. The severity of depression and its corresponding scores on the PHQ-9 were minimal depression (0-4), mild depression (5-9), moderate depression (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) , moderately severe depression (15) (16) (17) (18) (19) , and severe depression (20) (21) (22) (23) (24) (25) (26) (27) . 34 The Arabic version of the GAD-7 questionnaire has 7 items that assess the presence and severity of anxiety by also asking respondents how much they were bothered by anxiety symptoms during the past two weeks. 35 The response options and their corresponding scores were: nearly every day (3), more than half of the days (2), several days (1), or not at all (0), yielding a total score ranging from 0 to 21. The levels of anxiety and their corresponding scores were minimal anxiety (0-4), mild anxiety (5-9), moderate anxiety (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) , and severe anxiety (15) (16) (17) (18) (19) (20) (21) . 36 The Arabic version of the EMIC stigma scale is an easy-to-administer validated tool to assess an individual's perception of stigma by people nearby or close to them because of the individual's specific health condition. 33 Originally, the EMIC stigma scale was developed by Weiss et al as a tool to understand the stigma related to leprosy. Afterwards, its validity and reliability as a stigma assessment tool have been tested and confirmed in different settings and for other infectious and chronic diseases. [38] [39] [40] The EMIC stigma scale consists of 15 items related to the participant's feelings of stigma and are scored on a 4-point scale: Yes (3), Possibly (2), Uncertain (1), and No (0), with reverse scoring of item 2. The EMIC total score ranges from 0 to 36, with a higher score indicating a higher level of stigma. 37 ",

These possible associations of depression and anxiety with stigma were also reported in the literature in different settings and patient populations. 23, 45 However, no studies have examined the associations of depression and anxiety with stigma among patients with COVID-19. In addition, a significant association was found between being female and having increased mean scores for depression (\u03b2=3.071) and anxiety \u03b2=1.86), which is similar to the findings reported in local and international studies. [46] [47] [48] Females are generally more likely than their male counterparts to report symptoms of depression and anxiety which is hypothetically related to hormonal fluctuations, higher sensitivity to stress, and some socioeconomic factors, such as higher income in favor of their male counterparts. 49 Compared to other previously published studies, the participants in this study were less likely to experience depression and anxiety symptoms. For example, a study that evaluated the general population's mental health in Brazil during the COVID-19 outbreak indicated that 67.7% of participants had moderate to severe depression and 84.7% had anxiety symptoms. 50 Another study that assessed depression and anxiety among the general population of China found that 4.3% of participants suffered from severe depression while 8.4% experienced severe anxiety. 48 Furthermore, the prevalence of severe anxiety among the general Iranian population during the COVID-19 outbreak was 19.1%. 51 Nevertheless, a study conducted in Vietnam reported much lower rates of anxiety (4.9%) and depression (7.0%), compared to our estimates. 52 Many factors may explain the wide range of reported prevalence rates of depression and anxiety in different countries. This can be due to variation in the measures used to assess depression and anxiety in these studies, which were conducted during the COVID-19 outbreak. Furthermore, different approaches to categorizing levels of depression and anxiety were used in the different studies, which might have increased the variability of the results between the studies. Moreover, the timing of the study and the stage of the pandemic are other critical factors. It is expected that the psychological symptoms would be more prevalent during the early stages of the pandemic, as little information was known about the virus and the disease. For instance, in a study that evaluated depression and anxiety symptoms among 58 hospitalized COVID-19 patients in a universityaffiliated hospital in New York city, the prevalence of depression and anxiety upon admission were 29% and 36%, respectively. However, the prevalence of depression and anxiety symptoms dropped to 20% and 9%, respectively, after two weeks of follow-up. 53 Therefore, it would be interesting to know the impact of time on the symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stigma among the participants in this study couple of months or a year later.",
