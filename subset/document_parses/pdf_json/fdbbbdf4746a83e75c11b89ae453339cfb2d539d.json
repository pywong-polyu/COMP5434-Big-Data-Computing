SIRT1 is a crucial member of the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide-dependent deacetylase family via antiaging effects (12, 13) . In murine models of COPD, upregulation of SIRT1 alleviated inflammation and altered the expression of markers reflecting various pathways of aging, including decreased SIRT1 expression, compared with healthy controls (14) . These signals could be readily detected in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) (6, 7) , which are a relatively non-invasive sample source that has rendered the evaluation of aging marker expression in patients with chronic airway diseases technically feasible in clinical practice.",

This cross-sectional substudy showed that patients with bronchiectasis yielded a downregulation of SIRT1 in both the systemic circulation and different sites of bronchial epithelium in bronchiectasis, which remained valid after adjustment with the lung age. SIRT1 expression in the systemic circulation correlated with neither lung function impairment nor the integrated severity metrics. Moreover, the longitudinal substudy also showed that SIRT1 expression did not vary at exacerbation onset. Accelerated aging has been increasingly recognized responsible for the defective cell repair, and hence, altered microenvironment in chronic airway diseases. Signals reflecting accelerated aging have been detected in PBMCs and airway epithelium among patients with COPD and IPF (6, (20) (21) (22) . A pilot study has revealed reduced SIRT1 expression in the bronchiectatic airways (8) . In this study, we profiled SIRT1 and other aging marker in both the PBMCs and bronchiectatic epithelium. Aging marker profiling in PBMCs has been validated in COPD (14) . For instance, there was a good correlation between the telomere length derived from PBMCs and that from lung tissues (23) . Therefore, PBMCs served as a proxy of aging within lung tissues.",

This might be because oxidative stress attenuated SIRT1 expression via activating the phosphatidylinositol 3K\u03b1 signaling pathway (25) . Indeed, antioxidants had a role in modulating the lifespan in several animal models such as Caenorhabditis elegans (26) . However, this findings did not justify the correlation between SIRT1 expression and bronchiectasis severity. By comparison, SIRT1 expression in PBMCs did not differ between mild asthma and severe asthma (27) and SIRT1 expression in both the sputum supernatant and serum did not correlate with asthma severity (28) .

Moreover, the reduced SIRT1 expression was not tempered significantly by the inclusion of disease controls and the markedly greater age in patients with bronchiectasis.

It would be interesting to ascertain whether measures that aim to counter the accelerated aging might have a role in improving the clinical outcomes of bronchiectasis.

Outpatient services have been suspended during the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 and because of the policy to mitigate nosocomial crosscontamination, the follow-up scheme has been withheld between January and June 2020. We cannot comment on the impact of smoking on aging. However, the small number of ever-smokers suggested minor confounding effects. One of our important goals was to determine whether the expression levels of aging markers would differ dramatically in different portions of the tracheobronchial tree. Therefore, we have biopsied the surgically excised epithelium among patients who were scheduled for lung resection and transplantation instead of sampling via bronchoscopy. Hence, sampling from the completely healthy controls or patients with peripheral lung nodules who underwent bronchoscopy would not be possible. In this study, patients with IPF or lung tumors have constituted the disease controls, which could have partly obscured the difference in p16 and p21 expressions. In spite of this, the markedly reduced SIRT1 expression in patients with bronchiectasis as compared with the disease controls suggested that this findings pertaining to the role of SIRT1 in mediating accelerated aging in bronchiectasis remained valid. We did not enroll age-matched patients with bronchiectasis in Study 2, which might have confounded the expression levels of aging markers. However, the greater age in the disease controls would have maximized rather than diluted the between-group difference in the percentage of cells staining positive for the aging markers, which was clearly not the case in this study. In spite of these limitations, this study demonstrated lower percentage of cells staining positive for SIRT1 in patients with bronchiectasis, suggesting that the reduction in SIRT1 expression would have been more prominent. We did not analyze the consistency of aging marker expression levels in the PBMCs and bronchial epithelium derived from the same individual patients because the paired blood samples were not collected for this study in patients undergoing surgical resections. Although SIRT1 expression was independent of the disease severity and lung function impairment in this cohort, it would be vital and reasonable to assess the relationship between aging marker expression levels and clinically important outcomes such as mortality in future large-scale longitudinal studies given the lack of objective surrogate markers for survival prediction in patients with bronchiectasis at present. Validation of this findings in other patient populations is also needed. Finally, not all the markers were validated in the bronchial epithelium study and we selected three markers given their relationship with the aging pathways and the technical feasibility of staining.",
