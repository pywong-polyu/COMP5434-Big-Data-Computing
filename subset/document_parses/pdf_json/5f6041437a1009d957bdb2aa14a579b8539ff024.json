In addition to the previously mentioned measures, curfews have been implemented in some countries, which limit opportunities for outdoor activities. These measures have demonstrably positive short-term effects on virus transmission but may negatively affect population health, via decreased physical fitness, known to influence immune function. This effect may exert more severe long-term effects associated with immunological and cardiopulmonary functioning, and the ability to cope with infection [2] .",

In fact, even athletes that complete strength and endurance training programs at home have suffered from reduced aerobic capacity [3] . Consequently, this may contribute to anxiety, depression, mental health distress, and common chronic health diseases [1, [4] [5] [6] [7] . Indeed, D\u00f6nmez et al. [8] indicated that most of the professional football players (66%) had post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms that were caused by social isolation and home-quarantine. These psychological issues exert an influence on training and recovery in athletes [9] , which may lead to inferior performance compared to pre-lockdown. Concerning PA, frequency and duration would expectedly decrease in physically active people as a result of an inability to access gyms and health clubs, and reduced need for active transport (i.e., cycling or walking to work) [1, 7, 10] . Taken together, the pandemic exerts negative patterns on PA within the general population, but the effect on more competitive, and thus highly active individuals, is less known [7] . As a result of this paucity of data, and our previous experience in team handball, we sought to gain an understanding of the COVID-19 restrictions on PA in team handball players [9] .",

Results obtained during gameplay, prior to confinement, have shown that backcourt players cover larger distances and spend less time standing and walking, and together with pivots, have higher in-game heart rates and spend longer durations at higher intensities (>80% maximal heart rate) [12] . In contrast, wing players are faster than other playing positions, and pivots endure more body impact than other players [13] . Furthermore, wings are the shortest, have significantly lower body mass and body mass index (BMI) than other players; pivots are the heaviest, whereas other playing positions do not differ in height [11] .",

            "text": "As described previously [14] , when athletes, especially those who are well trained, are confined to their homes, their cardiorespiratory and neuromuscular adaptations to various types and extents of PA are likely attenuated or ameliorated. Individual characteristics determine the effects of training modification during quarantine [9, 15, 16] , and subsequently, there have been reductions in some components of fitness to a greater extent than others. Previous studies have reported changes in jumping performance, throwing velocity, maximum muscular strength, and upper and lower limb power during a handball season [11] . Moreover, it is conceivable that a lack of team training and official competitions in team sports may have decreased communication between players and coaching staff, resulting in inadequate training programming [17] . In addition, Sonza et al. [18] indicated that the COVID-19 pandemic influenced training practice and habits in term of frequency, duration, motivation, and period to exercise in Brazil and its main macro-regions. Furthermore, following the German lockdown for containment of the COVID-19 pandemic, highly trained kayakers and canoeists spent less overall time training each week (\u221228%) with, on average, shorter training sessions (\u221215%) and less light-to-moderate physical activity outside of training [19] . Additionally, de Albuquerque Freire et al. [20] demonstrated that COVID-19-related restrictions and quarantine had adverse effects on professional soccer players' Yo-Yo Intermittent Recovery Test performance. Therefore, in the context of COVID-19, public health measures such as isolation, curfews, and lockdowns could have resulted in partial or total reversal of the training adaptations (i.e., 'detraining') [11, 21] .",

For example, Lesser and Nienhuis [15] observed that the change in (\u2206)PA was dependent upon initial PA levels prior to confinement conditions, and Casta\u00f1eda-Babarro et al. [22] reported that males reported a greater decrease in vigorous PA than women, although both males and females reduced walking time to a similar extent. Moreover, sedentary time reportedly increased more in males than females, suggesting males are more susceptible to PA reductions and sedentary behavior increases than females during pandemics. Taken together, previous literature suggests pre-pandemic PA and biological sex may mediate the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on subsequent PA levels.",

Specifically, we aimed to determine changes since the COVID-19 outbreak and how PA of handball players compared to before the pandemic using questionnaires.

All PAand sitting time-related questions were presented in a differential format, to be answered directly in sequence regarding \"before\" and \"during\" confinement conditions [1, 25, 26] . Each item or question requested two answers, one regarding the period before and the other regarding the period during confinement, and participants were guided to compare the situations [1, 25, 26] . Once the deadline for admitting surveys had passed, answers were reviewed to remove contradictory responses (checking congruence between data provided by players) or repeated (checking two or more submissions with the same responses in a short period of time), deleting one response from the database. Given the large number of questions included, the present paper focuses on the IPAQ-SF as a brief crisis-oriented tool. Participants signed an informed consent form before completing the survey.

Thereafter, the survey was reviewed and edited by >35 colleagues and experts before being disseminated via the Google platform (online).

The general public assisted in the dissemination through promotion of the survey within their networks. The selection for the group was deliberate by the research group and the criterion of selection was based to include handball players aged \u2265 18 years of age and in good health (no pain and diagnosis at the time of examination), from different country in the world, different competition leagues, ranking level, amateur or professional, different position, and gender. The exclusion criteria included a positive COVID-19 test or existence of cognitive decline. In total, the uniform resource locator (URL) of the online survey was sent to 1500 potential participants, of which 1359 returned valid questionnaires that were included in the analysis (participation rate of 91%). The description of conditions of lockdown in the countries of the participants is displayed in Table 4 . The Emirati government issued a mandatory lockdown and closed commercial centers, malls, and open markets for two weeks, after which they will likely resume. Restaurants were ordered to exclusively offer take-out services. The survey included an introductory page describing the background and the aims of the survey, the consortium, ethics information for participants, and the option to choose one of five available languages (English, German, French, Arabic, and Japanese). The inclusion criterion was that participants were handball players aged 18 years or older and in good health. No restrictions in terms of playing level, categories, or playing position were made. Exclusion criteria included the existence of any chronic disease or orthopedic condition that might interfere with the participation in the study, and players with cognitive decline.

It is thought that walking PA is part of the activities of daily life, such as moving around the training facility and at work outside of handball training. Thus, the decrease of walking volume in our subjects may reflect an inactive habitual lifestyle. In addition, sitting time would also be considered an indicator of time is spent in the home. The sitting time on weekdays was increased from 2.87 \u00b1 1.44 h to 4.67 \u00b1 1.47 h in women and from 2.66 \u00b1 1.08 h to 5.20 \u00b1 1.00 h in men.

Previous studies have reported healthy population increased time spent viewing television, social networking, using a smartphone, and playing video games during COVID-19 home confinement [1, 16] . Our results demonstrate that even athletes have changed their lifestyle to be less active during this pandemic.

Thus, the impact of physical inactivity in daily life due to COVID-19 home confinement may be greater in athletes than in the general healthy population. It is thought that the greater negative effect was likely due to athletes being more physically active in daily life before COVID-19 home confinement than the normative healthy population.",

In this study, frequency, time, and metabolic expenditure of moderate to vigorous PA per week was reduced during COVID-19 home confinement. In general, handball players train 2-3 h per session, 4-5 times per week [36] . Furthermore, they play one game a week, depending on the time of year [36] . In this study, we observed that the frequency of PA per week (in time per day) at vigorous intensity decreased 49% in women and 57% in men during COVID-19 home confinement, likely resulting in considerable reductions in fitness. Although we were unable to quantify the reduction in fitness as a result of reduced moderate to vigorous PA, Fikenzer et al. [3] reported the COVID-19 lockdown led to a reduction in aerobic capacity of elite handball players without team training, despite the implementation of a home-based strength and endurance training program. Similarly, Mon-L\u00f3pez et al. [9] described COVID-19 affected the training load and recovery process and noted emotional intelligence could predict the change in training variables of top-level soccer players. The recent study of Mon-L\u00f3pez et al. [9] reported that handball players reduced training intensity and training volume, which is concordant with the present investigation.",

In fact, PA levels in professional female handball players before isolation were higher and the reduction greater.

Their physical activities at moderate and vigorous intensity consisted of individual outdoor exercise, such as walking, running, and cycling. In contrast, the amount of PA at moderate and vigorous intensity among handball players was significantly decreased in this study. The reason for this conflict in results could be the difference between individual PA for recreation and health promotion and competitive team sports [7] . People undertaking individual PA for recreation and health promotion may be able to continue the same exercise during lockdown by performing outdoor activity such as walking, running, and cycling, whereas handball players and those involved in indoor team sports may experience the greatest deleterious effect of confinement. It may be pragmatic to consider that COVID-19 quarantine has had effects at different levels (physical, physiological, psychological, and emotional) due to a change in the athletes' daily lives and training habits [5, 7, 16] , and these may not be universal among all athletes.",

There are major psychological repercussions of athletes' confinement due to lifestyle modification, as they have no reference to this new situation [43] . It is evident that athletes must follow a balanced rhythm of life, appropriate nutritional practices, exercise, and sleeping sufficiently [43] . Thus, a recommendation that can be made from the results of this study is that it is important for handball players to create a handball-specific exercise program to prevent disability after returning to the sport [43] . Training during home confinement will typically be limited to strength, power, and muscle endurance exercises, general physical preparation (e.g., aerobic training on a cycle ergometer), and stretching, among other isolation-limited activities. Acute responses to higher intensities and volumes of exercise can involve a greater risk of illness and impaired immune function [44] . In this context, Toresdahl and Asif [45] advised athletes to follow a conservative approach, limiting training sessions to <60 min and to <80% of maximum effort during this time to prevent COVID-19. Herrera-Valenzuela et al. [46] recommended high-intensity interval training (HIIT) for Olympic sports athletes that can be performed at home, to maintain their physical fitness, cardiorespiratory endurance, and musculoskeletal health. Improving balance may improve strength, power, and speed [47] and enhance subsequent training adaptations [48] . Balance training prior to power (plyometric) training can improve the degree of plyometric training adaptations [47] . Since balance exercises can typically be performed without additional equipment, it may be pragmatic for athletes confined during COVID-19 to emphasize balance training. Pedersen et al. [49] indicated that a prescribed home-based and group-based intervention with training time devoted to strength, jump, and sprint ability, yet regulated to maintain sufficient infection control level, was feasible and effective to preserve strength, jumping, and sprinting abilities of high-level female football players during a~3-month period of a pandemic-induced lockdown.",

However, one pertinent strength is the large sample size considered from multiple continents, enabled by our multilingual IPAQ-SF dissemination. We accept that this study has the disadvantage of a regional bias in the responses to the survey, despite this survey being open for handball players worldwide and consortium colleagues having distributed the link to the electronic survey via a range of methods. For example, 85% (1153/1359) of the participants were recruited in Asia. Handball players from Japan (n = 758; 56% related to the whole sample and 66% related to the Asia sample) were significantly overrepresented, while our aim was to reach many populations of handball players. Likely, nominated local colleagues that distributed the link in Japan were handball experts, who had more access to handball clubs, local federation, and teams. Consequently, the sample cannot be described as representative. The main limitation in this study, however, as with all self-reporting, is the possibility of reporting bias of PA (overestimation of PA), which is common among respondents of a self-reported questionnaire. However, we have asked the same questions in the survey about the two different periods (before and during home confinement by . Thus, we speculate that the degree of bias is similar based on the internal consistency of respondents. It is also possible that recall bias was manifest, and respondents were unable to correctly recall the amount of PA before confinement.",

From a statistical point of view, this is disadvantageous for variance analysis as well as the differences regarding performance levels (professionals, semi-professionals, amateurs), age, body mass, and height. Therefore, results may be biased by having unbalanced groups [50] and no far-reaching conclusions can be drawn. Accordingly, results should be interpreted with caution, due to sample imbalance with three countries being more prominent in the sample. Finally, from a methodological point of view, the implementation of research at the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic does not reflect the epidemic situation in some countries a few months after the study.",

Moreover, an improvement in monitoring systems for training quantity and quality would be desirable to draw conclusions that are based on objectively measured PA. For example, wearable technologies may be able to further elucidate the effects of COVID-19 confinement on PA, but this would require skills in big-data and web technologies. Finally, it would be of interest to examine the effect of PA changes on psychological wellbeing and how the decrease in physical activity translates into the sports level of players and their teams in future investigations.",

The confinement period has influenced the days, hours, and intensity of PA. Furthermore, COVID-19 confinement induced a marked decrease in PA of all intensities and reduced the mean categorization of participants from HEPA active to minimally active due to COVID-19 impact. These observations may be used to inform development of PA recommendations during prolonged home confinement and reduced ability to train in a team handball and/or indoors setting. There is a need to translate the findings of this research into future recommendations for home-based exercise intervention in order to improve participants' PA participation to maintain the HEPA active category in handball players during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. Identification of such sporting populations would allow for better-informed and more targeted mitigation strategies.
