This study analyzed the patterns and extent of inequality of opportunity in health and nutrition among children under-five across three countries sub-Saharan Africa with low Human development index (HDI). Methods: We used data from the Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey of the Democratic Republic of Congo (20,792 households, 21,756 women aged 15 to 49 and 21,456 children under five), Guinea Bissau (6601 households, 10,234 women aged 15-49 and 7573 children under five) and Mali (11,830 households, 18,409 women in 15-49 years and 16,468 children under five) to compute the human opportunity index (HOI) and the dissimilarity index (D-index).",

In Congo DR, the access rate was high for immunization (93.9%) for children in the most favorable group. In Mali, access rates stood at 6.56% for children in the most favorable group. In Guinea Bissau, the inequality of opportunity was important in access to health services before and after delivery (43.85%).

Given the direct impact of differences in circumstances on IoP and the significance of equality of opportunity on children's health and nutrition, there is a need to identify the patterns and extent of IoP in health and nutrition outcomes of children. By extension, decomposing IoP helps to identify and quantify the impact of each examined circumstance in explaining inequalities. The analysis reflects how far the sub-Saharan African countries are, from providing fair and equal access to a set of critical child health and nutrition development outcomes, irrespective of encountered circumstances. Accordingly, this study has two objectives: first, to analyze the patterns and extent of IoP in health and nutrition among children under-five in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Guinea Bissau and Mali. Secondly, to use the Shapley decomposition method to estimate the relative contribution of circumstances that are beyond the control of children under-five and affecting their development outcomes in later life stages.",

These are: i. Antenatal care or prenatal care (women's routine health control during pregnancy); ii. Birth's place (birth in health facilities or elsewhere); iii. Birth attended (assisted birth skilled health personnel or others); iv. Child's postnatal check-up (children medical checkup after delivery); v. Regular immunizations within 1 year after birth (vaccines to protect children from diseases); vi. Access to safe water (water from official sources of drinking water); vii. Access to toilet (availability of toilet in the house). These variables were used to construct three composite healthcare outcome indicators. The first indicator (HA1) relates to access to healthcare services before and after birth. This indicator was constructed by considering that children have access to healthcare services before and after birth if, at the same time, the mother received medical check-ups during pregnancy, gave birth in a health center assisted by qualified medical personnel and the child received postnatal check-up. The second (HA2) concerns access to immunizations. This indicator was built using the same information as that of the variable immunizations. The third indicator (HA3) considers access to housing services (water and sanitation facilities). This indicator was obtained by considering that an individual has access to housing services if, at the same time, he uses water from official sources of drinking water and has toilet in the house in which he/she lives.",

A total of seven circumstance variables were considered: (i) residence area; (ii) gender of child; (iii) number of children under 5; (iv) age of household head; (v) father's education; (vi) mother's education; (vii) economic wellbeing. These circumstance variables were then used to subdivide the sample of children into several subgroups ranging from the most favorable to the least favorable group. The objective here was to bring together children with identical life circumstances in order to capture the influence of the gap between the different groups on access to healthcare and nutritional outcome. These groups are built from a set of circumstantial variables having the same effects on access to healthcare and nutritional outcome. The idea of building groups is to take into account the interactive effects of the different circumstantial variables and not their individual effects given, for example, that a child in a poor family in a rural area will not necessarily have the same difficulties than one who is in a poor family but in urban area. The rest of this article will focus much more on the two extreme sub-groups (the most and the least favorable group). Thus, the least favorable group is built with characteristics recognized in the economic literature as having negative effects on access to healthcare and nutritional outcome such as: rural areas, poor households with more than two children for which the head has a low level of education. The most favorable group is characterized by circumstances recognized as having positive effects on access to healthcare and nutritional outcome such as urban areas, rich households with at most two children for which the head has a high level of education.",

It appears that children belonging to the most favorable group are those who have higher access to health services (with the exception of access to health services before and after delivery in Congo DR), immunization (from 80.65 to 93.9% depending on the country) and water and sanitation facilities (from 65.49 to 96.89% depending on the country). Considering that children's access to most health services is indirect and often passes through mothers, our results follow the same logic as those which find that parent (mothers in particular) living in good (favorable) conditions were associated with better access to healthcare services [33, 34] . Other studies show that poor living conditions are associated with poor access to basic healthcare services [13, 35] . The situation is similar in relation to access to children's nutrition for which there are disparities linked to differences in terms of living conditions between the two groups for the three countries. The extent of these disparities is less pronounced in Guinea Bissau compared to the other two countries [36] . These disparities in children's nutrition outcome according to socio-demographic is also found in the literature on inequality of health opportunity [23] . These results suggest that efforts in promoting, independently of the socio-economic and demographic characteristics of households, the major part of the services necessary for the health of the mother during pregnancy in order to fight against child malnutrition are much more noticeable in Guinea Bissau than the other two countries. It should be noted that, except Mali, the propensity of not having a malnutrition problem is high for children of the most favorable group, while the mother's access to blood tests during the pregnancy period is high for children of the least favorable group. This results can be explained by the fact that mothers with the characteristics of the least favorable group are much more sensitive to this aspect of health care in order to fight against malnutrition.",

It appears that, in Guinea Bissau and Mali, IoP is important in access to healthcare services before and after delivery (43.85% and 41.67% respectively) and in access to basic housing services for Congo DR (49.16%). For all the three countries, the results indicate that IoP has a significant contribution to disparities observed in child healthcare outcome. This finding is consistent with previous studies on the measure of children's health IoP [22, 37] . These high levels of IoP are associated with relatively low levels of HOI and the coverage rate reflecting the fact that only a small fraction of these indicators is equitably distributed between the children, independently of circumstances in which they live in these countries. However, the situation is different when considering immunization for which there are relatively high levels of HOI ranging from 53.73 to 83.79% and the coverage rate ranging from 57.65 to 86.78% depending on the country. This indicates that a high number of children benefit from immunization services regardless of their living conditions in these countries.",

The situation is similar for access to basic housing services and access to healthcare services before and after delivery in Guinea Bissau but for access to immunization, it is the mother's education level which contributes more to the inequality. Our finding is in line with previous studies which have also shown that household wealth and mother's education level are among the socio-economic characteristics that contribute the most to inequality [23, 37, 38] . The levels observed for the D-index show that the inequalities of opportunity are a reality in these countries and must be considered considerably in interventions to reduce inequality because it affects seriously the access to basic housing services which are important aspects of government interventions, aiming to ensure child health and survival, development and growth. Compared to the case of access to healthcare services, inequality of nutritional opportunity in these countries is at low levels ranging from 5.76 to 7.99% for the propensity of not having a malnutrition problem and from 12.86 to 17.90% for mother's blood tests during pregnancy depending on the country. However, the respective HOI levels and the coverage rate are relatively high meaning that efforts are made to reduce inequality of nutritional opportunity. Despite the low levels generally observed for propensity of not having a malnutrition problem and for the access of the mother to blood tests during the pregnancy, the results show that the prevalence of stunting, wasting and underweight depend on life circumstance variables. Our result is in line with those studies which find that the low values of IoP can be considered as a lower bound estimate of the circumstance's variables selected and must be considered in policies to reduce inequalities. One of these studies focused on Arab world and Turkey [22] and the authors found that IoP varies between 4% and 18% depending on the country. According to the Shapely decomposition, while household's welfare is the circumstance variable which explains much more the inequality observed in the propensity of not having a malnutrition problem in Guinea Bissau and Mali, it is the place of residence which contributes much more in Congo DR. These results are also consistent with those which, in addition to the household wealth and mother's education, mention the place of residence as an important characteristic in explaining the IoP [37] [38] [39] . For mother's blood tests during the pregnancy, household's welfare, number of children under five [23] and household size are circumstance's variables which explained much more inequality respectively in Guinea Bissau, Congo DR and Mali.",

The household's welfare is the circumstance variable which contributes much more to inequality in access to healthcare and nutrition services among children of the most favorable group and those of the least favorable group. With gaps in child health and nutrition arising in childhood, identification of inequalities will inform policy interventions aiming to fill these gaps and to improve equal opportunity indices for children in sub-Saharan Africa. Ultimately, the findings will help to steer the life course of disadvantaged children towards healthy and productive lives in adulthood. These results also imply that interventions aimed at improving wellbeing or reducing poverty can help to reduce considerably IoP. In addition, promoting the education of women with considerations on the place of residence in which they live can be an effective intervention to reduce the IoP.",
