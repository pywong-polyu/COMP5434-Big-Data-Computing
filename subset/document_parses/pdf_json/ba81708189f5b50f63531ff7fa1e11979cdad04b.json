An average of 2.56 (SD = 1.01) of those conspiracy theory posts called for some form of action or uprising against the government measures taken for COVID-19. At the same time, many older conspiracy theories and myths were resurfacing on social media or even linked somehow to the current COVID-19 situation (e.g., 5G telephony, vaccination link to autism, etc.). Conspiracy theory beliefs are not a new pandemic phenomenon [1, 2] , yet they seem to have taken central stage during this pandemic. Early in the COVID-19 pandemic emergence, the WHO Director General postulated that we are \"not just fighting an epidemic; we're fighting an infodemic. Fake news spreads faster and more easily than this virus, and is just as dangerous\" [3] . Subsequently, others have studied this phenomenon and raise similar concerns [4] .",

A common function of myths was to alleviate the anxiety created by the unknown and pass responsibility on to deities in an attempt to feel that not all in life is random [7] . It appears that even today, despite the advent of science, when events are inexplicable or anxiety provoking, humans rush to rationalize and turn to myths and conspiracy theories to help alleviate fears and anxieties [8] .",

Conspiracy theories are commonly defined as beliefs that attempt to explicate uncommon, distressing events, including disease epidemics [9] . Conspiracy theories attribute the cause of unexplained events to human malevolence [10, 11] . \"Conspiracy theories flourish in times of crisis when people feel threatened, uncertain, and insecure\" [2] . Increased anxiety and other mental health problems, such as depression, have been indeed linked to higher levels of conspiracy theory beliefs [12] . The need to rationalize inexplicable events and diffuse anxiety levels, lead individuals to believing in imagined (vs. factual) theories [9] . Therefore, not unlike the ancient Greeks, individuals today form myths and conspiracy theories that entail some truth (e.g., coronaviruses are just another family of viruses with flu like symptoms) and some fabricated components (e.g., this coronavirus is just a plot by governments to control us [13] .",

Today, humans are socially connected and continuously updated with real or fake (and often a combination of both) news. This virtual social connection helps conspiracy theories spread quickly around the globe [14] . Unfortunately, a large number of individuals choose to believe myths and conspiracy theories over scientific evidence. The internet and social media are also widely used as means to receive information regarding anxiety and other mental or physical health problems [15] or simply as a venue for stress-relief and support [16] . Thus, especially those who may be more prone to stress, a bombardment of conspiracy theories from social media may feed their fears, provide plausible solutions, and render them more susceptible to believing such myths and conspiracies.",

Believing in conspiracy theories is a combination of individual (e.g., personality traits and education [19] and social factors (e.g., with whom you \"hang out\" [20] . Such factors also include lower self-esteem, political cynicism, social exposure to conspiracy theories, lower agreeableness, generalized distorted thinking and paranormal beliefs, chronic feelings of psychological and sociopolitical disempowerment, intense feelings of uncertainty, lower educational level, lower crystallized intelligence, feelings of belonging in an intergroup social conflict, mistrust of government, paranoia/suspiciousness, lower analytical thinking, schizotypy, and stronger religiosity [1, 9, 19, [21] [22] [23] .

For example, measles is resurging due to the widespread conspiracy theory beliefs surrounding vaccinations [23] . Studies are reporting that refusing empirically supported medications and lifesaving vaccinations, rejecting the use of sunscreens, and turning to unsupported alternative medicine and rejecting the need for physical check-ups, are often linked to conspiracy theory beliefs [25] . Recently, [26] in a study reported alarming findings that showed that untrue rumors and conspiracy theories are leading people to vaccine hesitancy for COVID-19.",

This study aimed to ascertain the prevalence of conspiracy beliefs in the first half of April 2020, during strictly enforced social isolation and quarantine regulations. Secondly, it explored the impact of such beliefs on public health and safety behaviors (i.e., adherence to governmental regulations and recommendations) by assessing whether conspiracy beliefs predict willingness to adhere to such measures. Thirdly, the study assessed whether the subjective reporting of psychological distress relating to COVID-19 predicts higher levels of conspiracy theory beliefs and lower adherence to social distancing and health recommendations. The study also evaluated the relationship between trust in scientists and believing conspiracy theories.",

            "text": "Similar to Allington [35, 36] , who has been warning about the risks of conspiracy theories for the greater public, the current study demonstrated that as the strength of conspiracy theory beliefs increases, the willingness to adhere to public health recommendations and government enforced measures (in this instance for COVID-19) decreases significantly. At the same time, conspiracy theory believers were less trustful of science and scientists and therefore less likely to follow COVID-19 recommendations and measures. The seriousness of these findings can be further appreciated, when combined with past studies, which found rejection of scientific facts due to conspiracy theories \"criminalizing\" medicine and medications [37] ; for example, avoiding vaccinations to the point that eradicated illnesses are returning, avoiding the use of condoms and placing individuals at higher risk for contracting HIV [38] , and most recently avoiding vaccinations for COVID-19 [26] . During this pandemic, we witnessed citizen groups pushing for uprising and asking others to join them in breaching the \"stay-at-home\" and \"social distancing\" regulations enacted by governments and strongly recommended by scientists. Indeed, it has been found that conspiracy theory believers are more prone to aggression and stirring social unrest [39] . The call for uprising is often based on and/or strengthened by conspiracy theories and uprisers, who may endanger themselves and others in their community. Thus, it is evident that conspiracy theory belief is not merely a benign phenomenon [40] . Related to this phenomenon is psychological state, which was found to be a predictor of stronger conspiracy theory beliefs. Age, education, living area, and income significantly improve this prediction, with lower age, lower education, living in less densely populated areas, and lower income were also associated with stronger conspiracy theory beliefs. This is a cross sectional self-report study and as such presents with several limitations. Participants constituted an opportunistic sample of social media users in Cyprus and Greece. Interestingly, the sample comprised mostly females with most being highly educated (tertiary education). As such, this may have introduced some bias with highly educated individuals being over-represented in this sample. However, as per the latest Eurostat \"Educational Attainment Statistics,\" Cyprus has the highest educational tertiary educational attainment in the European Union (about 60%) with women particularly presenting really high educational attainment rates [41] . Greece is also above the EU average for tertiary educational attainment [41] . Interestingly, despite the finding that educational attainment was inversely related to conspiracy theory beliefs, this sample of albeit highly educated individuals presented with high levels of conspiracy theory beliefs. This finding needs to be further explored in the future to examine whether and how science is failing to pass its message to the public.",

Easily accessible psychological support for people coming from all socioeconomic levels could have a large role in combating conspiracy theories or alleviating the need to utilize conspiracies to explain situations that may cause distress. At the same time, health and mental health professionals can affect conspiracy theory belief by offering reliable and valid psychoeducation surrounding COVID-19 related matters along with their other services. In particular, health professionals need to be constantly updated not only about valid scientific facts, but also concerning circulating internet and media-based fake news, myths, and conspiracy theories; by doing so, health professionals can join forces together in the fight against myths and conspir-acy theories relating to COVID-19 and other pathogens. Grimes [42] recently proposed that health professionals and scientists should together aim to utilize education in the fight against conspiracy theory beliefs. For psychoeducation to be effective, it should also instigate analytical thinking, which appears to decrease conspiracy theory adherence [22] .",

            "text": "The direct competition science has with conspiracy theories is intense. Conspiracy theories about COVID-19 are spreading faster than other ideas [4] . Is science failing to communicate effectively its messages about COVID-19? Are conspiracy theories winning over science? Unfortunately, our findings support that this may be the case. Conspiracies, in opposition to scientific jargon, appeal to emotions, tell interesting stories, and use simple, comprehensible, and impressionable language. Science can borrow from the impressionable methods used by conspiracy theorists and myth-spreaders. Science and its findings need to be delivered in more receptive and emotion-inducing ways. Science tends to present numbers, jargon, and difficult concepts to comprehend, even when informing the public in the news. For instance, even in prime-time news broadcasts scientists speak about COVID-19 and use jargon and acronyms such as RNA virus, ACE2 receptor binding, interaction with angiotensin, virus lipid membrane, glycoproteins, etc., without comprehensible explanations. Science could invest in science communication or the sociology of science so as to more effectively communicate the work of scientists to the public. For example, in line with the recent suggestions by the World Health Organization [3] and a recent study [26] , conspiracy theories about COVID-19 and other public health concerns need to be combated immediately when they appear, and science could use social media to inform the public about correct facts. In addition, scientific findings need to be presented in simple, easily understood, comprehensible language. Science can also borrow techniques from marketing practices and from consumer behavior research [17, 43] concerning capturing the attention of the public when it comes to public health issues and population safety. Scientists may consider themselves \"flooding\" social media and the internet, in general, with scientific facts and findings that help alleviate fears rather than elevate them. In fact, [40] , proposed that societies, science, and social media need to be much more aggressive in blocking conspiracy theories. For these actions all sciences (e.g., medical, biological, social, educational, political), in coordination with local and international health organizations, need to work side by side. Such a proactive approach may help science win over conspiracy theory beliefs. ",

The regression was significant, F (1,999) = 16.78, p < 0.001, with an R 2 of 0.02, standard error of the estimate = 24.31. The standardized beta for PS was 0.13, t = 4.10, p < 0.001. The participants' predicted CB was equal to 37.64 + 0.35 \u00d7 PS. Thus, CB increased 0.35 points for each point increase in PS (distress).",
