The outbreak started in Wuhan, Hubei province of China, in November 2019. The World Health Organization (WHO) declared it as a pandemic on March 12, 2020. As of now, on April 20, 2020, more than 2.4 million patients have been affected worldwide, with approximately 170,000 deaths across the globe. Risk factors for severe disease and poor outcome are age >65 years and underlying comorbid conditions such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.",

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) emerged in southern China in November 2002 and resulted in more than 800 deaths. 4 The Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), first detected in Saudi Arabia in 2012, was responsible for at least 2,220 cases and 790 fatalities, with more than 80% cases reported in the Middle East and particularly in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. 5, 6 Overall damage was limited in both the epidemics. Limited humanto-human transmission of MERS-CoV, and the absence of mild infection and the lack of human-to-human transmission in SARS-CoV virus were the factors responsible for the limited spread. Concerns have been raised previously regarding future serious outbreaks with similar zoonotic viruses. Changes in social practices, the environment, and travel were thought to provide new opportunities for zoonotic pathogens to infect humans. 7 The fear of pandemic became a truth in late 2019, with Wuhan, Hubei province of China, being the epicenter In late December 2019, clusters of patients were detected with pneumonia of unknown cause, that were epidemiologically linked to a seafood and wet animal wholesale market in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. Initial research led to novel betacoronavirus belonging to the sarbecovirus subgenus of the Coronaviridae family as the causative agent and was given the name as 2019-nCoV or (SARS-CoV-2). 8 SARS-CoV-2 is the seventh coronavirus species to cause human disease. 1 The occurrence of asymptomatic infections and humanto-human transmission are the major factors responsible for failure to contain the virus.",

Around 2 to 10% of patients with COVID-19 had gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea, abdominal pain, and vomiting. 14, 15 Liver impairment has been reported previously with both SARS and MERS-CoV. Liver involvement was seen in 60% cases of SARS-CoV infection. 16, 17 Hepatic involvement was likely due to the cytopathic effect of the virus, as the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction showed SARS-associated coronavirus in liver tissue. Histopathology revealed proliferating cells, apoptosis ballooning of hepatocytes, and mild-to-moderate lobular lymphocytic infiltration. 18 Similarly, hepatic involvement was reported with MERS CoV infection. 19 Multiple studies have reported the hepatic involvement in the COVID-19 disease. Liver damage is mostly transient and mild in patients with COVID-19 and can return to normal without any special treatment. Rare cases of severe acute hepatitis have been described in patients with COVID-19. 14 ACE2 is present in biliary and liver epithelial cells, explaining the involvement of the liver in the COVID-19 disease. 20 Though ACE2 expression is higher in cholangiocytes than hepatocytes, the most common laboratory abnormality is mild elevation of alanine transaminase and aspartate transaminase, indicating hepatocyte injury. Around 14 to 53% of cases had elevated alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase during disease progression. 21 Elevated liver enzymes can be due to hepatocyte injury, myositis, myocardial injury, hypoxia, or side effect of various therapeutic agents. Patients with severe COVID-19 seem to have higher rates of liver dysfunction. 22 Yang et al reported a similar incidence of elevated liver enzymes in survivors and nonsurvivors. 23 Gamma glutamyl transferase (GGT) and alkaline phosphatase may be elevated in COVID-19 patients. GGT and alkaline phosphatase levels were found to be elevated in 30 (54%) and 1 (1.8%) of 56 patients with COVID-19, respectively.",
