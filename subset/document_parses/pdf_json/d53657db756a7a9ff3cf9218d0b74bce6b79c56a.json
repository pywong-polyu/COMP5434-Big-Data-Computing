            "text": "Objective: To explore diverse provider perspectives on: strategies for addressing patient medication cost barriers; patient medication cost information gaps; current medication cost-related informatics tools; and design features for future tool development. Materials and Methods: We conducted 38 semistructured interviews with providers (physicians, nurses, pharmacists, social workers, and administrators) in a Midwestern health system in the United States. We used 3 rounds of qualitative coding to identify themes. Results: Providers lacked access to information about: patients' ability to pay for medications; true costs of full medication regimens; and cost impacts of patient insurance changes. Some providers said that while existing cost-related tools were helpful, they contained unclear insurance information and several questioned the information's quality. Cost-related information was not available to everyone who needed it and was not always available when needed. Fragmentation of information across sources made cost-alleviation information difficult to access. Providers desired future tools to compare medication costs more directly; provide quick references on costs to facilitate clinical conversations; streamline medication resource referrals; and provide centrally accessible visual summaries of patient affordability challenges. Discussion: These findings can inform the next generation of informatics tools for minimizing patients' out-ofpocket costs. Future tools should support the work of a wider range of providers and situations and use cases than current tools do. Such tools would have the potential to improve prescribing decisions and better link patients to resources. Conclusion: Results identified opportunities to fill multidisciplinary providers' information gaps and ways in which new tools could better support medication affordability for patients.",

            "text": "Medication costs in the United States are among the world's highest. 1 Of medications purchased in the United States, 70% include patient out-of-pocket costs 2 and 24% of adults taking prescription drugs have difficulty affording them. 3 Higher out-of-pocket costs are associated with greater odds of prescription abandonment 4 and cost concerns contribute to lower adherence of people with chronic conditions. 5, 6 It is estimated that 20-30% of diabetes-and hypertension-related prescriptions are never filled. 7, 8 Not taking medications as prescribed can worsen chronic conditions 3, 9 and increase emergency room visits and hospitalizations. 10, 11 Low-income patients are disproportionately affected by costs, especially when uninsured or underinsured. [12] [13] [14] African American and Hispanic populations have consistently worse chronic disease outcomes than Whites 15 and are most affected by cost-related adherence barriers. [16] [17] [18] Many prescribers report considering patients' out-of-pocket costs in making treatment decisions. One US study showed that 78% of physicians routinely consider costs when prescribing generic drugs; a more common practice for those with larger proportions of Medicaid-insured patients. 19 A survey of nurse practitioners (NPs) found that they considered costs in 58% of prescriptions. 20 Prescribers also consider attention to patient medication costs important. A physician survey found that most believed it was important to minimize out-of-pocket cost (94%) and total cost (94%) when equally safe and effective medications were available. 21 Similarly, 90.3% of NPs in a US survey thought cost should be considered when prescribing. 20 To address costs, physicians and NPs report using strategies such as switching to generic medications, 22 ,23 although they are not always more affordable. 24, 25 Physicians may also reduce costs by discontinuing nonessential medicines, 22 especially for older adults. 26, 27 Additionally, providers often adopt patient-by-patient approaches to affordability challenges via resources like discounts, drug coupons, and assistance programs. 28, 29 Despite such documented efforts, several known barriers limit provider access to information needed to address patient medication affordability issues. Physicians face information gaps concerning list prices and copayments 21 ; this may make it difficult for physicians to respond to copayment changes unless these are large and widely adopted across insurers. 30 Physicians and NPs may also have difficulty estimating list prices. 28 Furthermore, while patients can provide information concerning their needs, 31 and may influence prescribing decisions, 32 not all disclose cost barriers. 2, 33 Expanded social and economic risk screening 34 may make financial information more available at the point of care. Published screening instruments often ask about financial strain, including payment difficulties. [35] [36] [37] However, it is unclear whether providers consistently have access to such information when developing treatment plans or addressing affordability barriers. Furthermore, the number and complexity of cost alleviation resources may limit both patients' and providers' abilities to navigate them efficiently. For example, some pharmaceutical companies offer charitable assistance programs that provide free or lowcost medications to eligible patients, 38 usually based on income and insurance access. Other charitable programs may have related restrictions, such helping only insured individuals. 39 Multiple strategies have been proposed to address some of these barriers, and more systematically address patients' medication costrelated challenges. 40 Notably, price transparency to influence clinical decisions is receiving increasing attention, including policy efforts to prevent \"surprise billing,\" 41 for out-of-network providers. 42, 43 For prescribing decisions, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) issued a rule requiring Medicare Part D health plans to adopt real-time benefit tools (RTBT) that integrate with e-prescribing or electronic health record (EHR) systems by January 1, 2021. Such RTBTs should provide \"complete, accurate, timely and clinically appropriate patient-specific real-time formulary and benefit. . .information (including cost, formulary alternatives, and utilization management requirements).\" 44 Multiple e-prescribing and EHR systems have launched RTBTs with price transparency features. [45] [46] [47] Some scholars advocate for EHRs to display drug prices, 48 and surveys show that healthcare providers want information about out-of-pocket medication costs and lower-cost alternatives. 49 Some RTBTs add cost information to after-visit summaries (AVSs), which may help surface patients' costs concerns. However, researchers criticize the CMS rule due to the lack of RTBT interoperability standards, 50 and evidence that EHR-based price transparency influences medication costs has been inconsistent. [51] [52] [53] [54] [55] [56] [57] [58] [59] Furthermore, although new tools such as RTBTs may address prescribers' desires for point-of-care tools to recommend alternatives, 60 there has been little attention to the needs and perspectives of a range of providers engaged with addressing patients' medication affordability challenges, such as pharmacists, nurses, social workers, and advanced practice providers, in designing such tools. Pharmacists assist patients in identifying cost-effective insurance plans 61, 62 and selecting lowercost medications. 63, 64 Nurses assess healthcare resource access, 65, 66 including medications. 67 Social workers connect patients to costalleviation resources. 68 ,69 Yet, we know little about the cost-related information gaps diverse providers face, how current informatics tools support their work, and their design preferences for future tools.",

The system provides a variety of informatics tools to help clinical teams identify and address medication cost-related issues. These include EHR-based social needs screening/documentation tools in 8 of 14 clinical settings represented in the sample. Affordability resources include sources listed on a Sharepoint site and cost-related applications such as GoodRx on providers' devices. An EHR-based real-time eligibility (RTE) system handles prescription pre-authorizations. In February 2020, the system launched an EHR-integrated RTBT; interviews were conducted between March and September 2020. Only ambulatory prescribers could use the RTBT directly (see Table 1 for details regarding participant RTBT access). The RTBT contained insurance information from all major payers, including data for 88-95% of patients. Uncovered patients included uninsured patients or those whose insurers had not contracted with the RTBT vendor. When ordering medications for insured patients, clickable alerts indicated availability of lower-cost medications. When clicked, these presented alternatives based on copayment tier as a tier number or copayment amount. Medications with lower tiers could be substituted. Prior authorization information was updated simultaneously. The system could only consider 1 medication and 1 payer at a time and required staff pharmacy benefits verification during patient rooming. It also added information on medications and out-ofpocket costs to AVSs provided to patients on paper afterwards. At system launch, RTBT use instructions were distributed via email to all clinical providers.",

We captured a diverse sample of clinical settings and professional roles, including 5 participants with independent prescribing privileges, and 3 pharmacists who could prescribe or change prescriptions under a collaborative practice agreement. We also included providers who deal with medication affordability challenges in other ways (eg, nurses, social workers). A researcher (SRW) within the health system led email recruitment. Of 67 providers invited, 38 agreed to interviews (57%). Most who did not participate did not respond (23/29, 79%); 4 declined (14%); 2 were unable (7%).",

Participants reported 3 strategies for reducing patient medication costs: reducing the number of prescriptions taken, prescribing less expensive but comparable medications, and connecting patients to cost-alleviation resources. Providers in settings without SDOH screening lacked information about ability to pay; even with screening, this information could be difficult to locate within the EHR. Sometimes, providers discovered financial barriers only after clinical encounters. Notably, fixing such problems is not typically reimbursed. Providers also reported difficulty with gauging medication regimens' true costs. Prescription information available through the RTBT was not always available when needed. Cost clarity was lacking when insurance situations changed, and due to tier-based copayment information. Quality questions emerged regarding external resources and uncertainty about how existing tools such as the RTBT functioned; this might be improved by offering provider training in future implementations. Nevertheless, cost-related infor-mation was not available to everyone who needed it due to workflow/system mismatches and permissions based on prescribing privileges. Although the RTBT integration into the ordering process was valued, cost-related information was also desired during other workflow phases. Fragmentation and lack of EHR integration impeded access to need and referral information. Providers described desired use cases for future tools. Study results aligned with prior findings concerning prescribing providers' strategies for addressing affordability, such as prescribing comparably effective, less costly medications. 22, 23 Our findings extend prior research by documenting involvement of providers from multiple disciplines in each strategy. Moreover, results point to gaps in support for technology support for members of these other disciplines. For example, because prescribers may not enter their own orders, the RTBT may not always be used by relevant decision- . .\" (P23, Nurse) \"Just a simple tab would be wonderful!. . . so we will know where to go to get that information if it is in regards to client medications. . .we could go to for patient discounted rates or something like that. . .\" (P14, Nurse) Nonintegration of resources into existing systems: \". . .there are resources out there. . .but the fact that they're not. . .integrated into our system makes it' harder to use them. . .Fingertip Formulary. . .you have to go to a different system. . .it's going to take a lot of time and it's not going to become something that I can use while the patient's sitting there.\" (P34, Pharmacist) \"[Medication cost apps are]. . . so user-dependent. . .that's going to be at the forefront for some providers and. . .not for others.\" (P7, Physician) makers. These findings suggest the importance of ensuring that cost tools support all providers involved in reducing costs. This is especially important given how large physicians' patient panels can be, and the limited time which they may have available to address cost issues with individual patients. In facilitating the work of a wider range of providers, future tools should also support a wider range of use cases. Such use cases involve prescribing decisions made when providers are not placing orders, facilitating changes made by ancillary staff, and links to relevant cost-reduction resources. Our findings are also consistent with prior work suggesting true out-of-pocket medication cost information is not easily accessible. 21 In our study, information gaps persisted even in the RTBT context. This may partly be because only 4 participants had used the RTBT directly, whereas 3 had used the RTBT indirectly or been involved in its implementation. Yet, RTBT users' experiences revealed gaps related to missing insurers and insurance coverage information. Missing insurance data is a long-standing problem with real-time pharmacy benefits information. 75 This suggests ongoing needs to incorporate up-to-date, comprehensive coverage information into RTBTs; one solution is continued expansion of contracts between insurers and RTBT vendors. Furthermore, reliance on confirming insurance at the beginning of a visit may have led to more missing data. Thus, similar to other interventions in which patients helped improve the accuracy of their medication documentation, 76 new tools might address data quality concerns by enabling coverage confirmation during a portal-based check-in.",

Design approaches such as providing references and rationales for alerts or recommendations 78, 79 and collecting local validation data on RTBTs' cost information may increase trust. 77 A further quality issue emerged due to the dynamic nature of insurance information, which could undermine data currency. Accordingly, providers wanted tools to account for total expenditures over the course of a year or after insurance changes regarding medication coverage. Tools to support workflows to correct this, such as a reviewing annual benefit updates and revisiting prescriptions as necessary might also help systematically address these concerns.",

            "text": "Findings also pointed to providers' knowledge gaps regarding patient's ability to pay and difficulties in relying on patients to disclose challenges. Prior research has shown that patients may not disclose barriers due to embarrassment or doubt that providers can help. 80, 81 Patients may not discuss cost unless asked, 82 such as when providers note adherence problems. 23, 60 Similarly, we found that information about challenges might be elicited only after prescriptions went unfilled. However, some providers reported surfacing cost barriers by routinely asking about cost concerns, particularly those working in the 8 clinical settings that had implemented SDOH screening programs. In related work, we have also shown that some patients are willing to disclose more detailed information about their abilities to pay for medications if this can lead to them being prescribed more affordable medications. 83 However, as described elsewhere, 31 access to patientreported SDOH data can be limited by security permissions and omission from structured EHR fields. To improve access to information about patients' abilities to pay, this study recommends using clear visual summaries in easily accessible EHR locations. Making AVS cost summaries available during visits, rather than just after, could facilitate cost-related conversations between providers and patients. [84] [85] [86] [87] [88] [89] Patientfacing reports and materials advocated by participants may assist here, although health literacy concerns suggest that special care should be taken to ensure that their design follows relevant communication guidelines, such as use of plain language or pictographs. Recent work 88, 90, 91 highlights opportunities to expand cost-related content in patient decision aids; our findings suggest the need for exact dollar values rather than tier numbers. As in previous work, 60 we found that physicians, NPs, and pharmacists refer patients to discount services such as GoodRx and $4 generics and physicians refer them to assistance programs. 22 Findings newly highlight how some providers tackle medication barriers by addressing other needs, such as transportation. This reveals the value of integrating information about medication referrals and resources into general community resource referral platforms that have databases of social service agencies, suggest referrals based on screening, send referrals, track outcomes, and integrate with EHR systems. 92 While such platforms may include some medication access resources, there is likely a need to expand to include cost resources currently used by our participants, such as GoodRx. However, as discussed elsewhere, 93 human assistance in choosing and facilitating connections to referral sources will still be needed.",

While this may limit the generalizability of the results, a strength is that we interviewed providers in 8 different professional roles to gather a variety of viewpoints. A unique characteristic of the health system was the MAP, which other systems may not have. This study's providers may have thus been more aware of medication assistance needs due to this resource. This may also be a strength, as informants were already aware of at least 1 relevant resource. The health system's RTBT was intended for prescribers only; only 4 prescribing providers had used it directly, and 1 implementer and 2 secondary users discussed its use. The study took place during the COVID-19 pandemic; although many participants retained clinical duties, they may have had limited bandwidth to learn about new tools. Therefore, our findings should be confirmed in future studies. It is important to emphasize, however, that the novel features that informants prioritized are not currently available in the health system's RTBT.",
