However, online studies of auditory perception, especially of psychoacoustic phenomena pertaining to low-level sensory processing, are challenging because of limited available control of the acoustics, and the unknown hearing status of participants. Here, we outline our approach to mitigate these challenges and validate our procedures by comparing web-based measurements to labbased data on a range of classic psychoacoustic tasks. Individual tasks were created using jsPsych, an open-source javascript front-end library. Dynamic sequences of psychoacoustic tasks were implemented using Django, an open-source library for web applications, and combined with consent pages, questionnaires, and debriefing pages. Subjects were recruited via Prolific, a web-based human-subject marketplace. Guided by a meta-analysis of normative data, we developed and validated a screening procedure to select participants for (putative) normal-hearing status; this procedure combined thresholding of scores in a suprathreshold cocktail-party task with filtering based on survey responses. Headphone use was standardized by supplementing procedures from prior literature with a binaural hearing task.",

Conventionally, such psychoacoustic experiments have been performed on a small number of listeners with known audiological characteristics, and in controlled laboratory environments. In this realm, individual variability is a nuisance parameter. In recent years, studies with a larger number of participants have exploited individual differences to understand foundational aspects of auditory processing (McDermott et al., 2010; Bharadwaj et al., 2015; Whiteford et al., 2020) . However, large-N studies are difficult to perform in a laboratory environment. Web-based platforms provide an attractive alternative to quickly and cost-effectively perform studies with a large number of participants (Woods et al., 2015; Gosling and Mason, 2015) . Furthermore, online platforms offer tremendous advantages in allowing researchers to access diverse and representative subject pools, perform cross-cultural research, and serve populations that may otherwise be unable to participate by visiting laboratory facilities (Henrich et al., 2010; Woods et al., 2013) .",

            "text": "In the auditory domain, online platforms are being increasingly used to complement lab-based work (Lavan et al., 2019; McPherson and McDermott, 2018; Zhao et al., 2019) . The COVID-19 pandemic has also hastened the auditory research community's trend towards adopting online platforms. Indeed, the Psychological and Physiological Acoustics Technical Committee of the Acoustical Society of America established a Remote Testing Task Force to collect and curate information aimed at enhancing the practicality and quality of research conducted via remote testing approaches (Peng et al., 2020) . Yet, to date, the literature on web-based testing of auditory perception is limited and consists primarily of examples probing higher-level cognitive aspects of auditory perception rather than low-level sensory processing. This may be in part because although studies in other domains have demonstrated that online measurements can yield high-quality data (Clifford et al., 2014; Woods et al., 2015) , there is cause for skepticism about the quality of web-based psychoacoustics data for low-level aspects of auditory processing which may be more sensitive to the testing parameters and participant characteristics. Beyond the typical concerns regarding participant engagement and compliance that apply in all domains, web-based auditory experiments also have to contend with sacrificing control of sound calibration and the listening environment (e.g., ambient noise). With web-based testing, participants use their own computers and perform tasks in the environments available to them. Furthermore, given that hearing loss is highly prevalent, for example one in eight United States individuals aged 12 or older have hearing loss in both ears (Lin et al., 2011) , it is likely that subject pools recruited online will consist of a significant number of individuals with hearing loss. Because hearing loss influences many aspects of auditory perception (Moore, 2007) , procedures that can classify the hearing status of anonymous participants will considerably enhance the interpretability of web-based psychoacoustic measurements.",

While still far from the highly controlled settings in the lab, the use of headphones (or insert earphones) by participants improves the standardization of sound presentation. Headphones can attenuate ambient noise, exclude acoustic filtering that might result from the physical configuration of speakers and room reverberation, and allow for ear-specific stimulus presentation. Woods et al. (2017) developed a loudnessperception-based procedure to check for headphone use by exploiting the fact that antiphasic stimuli presented from two free-field speakers partially cancel each other, reducing the overall intensity. Here, we supplemented this procedure with a binaural hearing task that is difficult to perform with one or two free-field speakers, and difficult with monaural use of earphones, but easy with stereo headphones for individuals with normal hearing and most forms of hearing loss. We also developed and validated procedures to classify the hearing status of the participants. While conventional audiometry is infeasible without calibrated hardware, there is considerable literature on hearing screening over the telephone using suprathreshold stimuli (Smits et al., 2004; Watson et al., 2012) . Inspired by this literature, we implemented participant screening by combining scores in a web-based word-recognition-in-babble task with self reports of hearing status. The choice of cutoff scores for the word recognition task were guided by a meta analysis of the literature and validation experiments. We validate the hearing-status classification procedure in a cohort of individuals with an audiological diagnosis of hearing loss. Taken together, our screening procedures help filter our subject pool for good engagement, putative normal-hearing status (if desired), and compliance with instructions to use stereo headphones. Furthermore, we validate our overall procedures by comparing the performance of screened participants on a range of classic psychoacoustic tasks with lab-based results obtained from subjects with known audiometrically normal-hearing status and prior literature.",

On the next screen, they were instructed to hit \"play\" on a calibration sound, and adjust the volume level up to a clearly audible and comfortable level while the calibration sound is playing. The calibration sound for each task was chosen to have similar spectro-temporal characteristics as the stimuli in the task (often just long strings of stimuli from the task). The stimuli for all audio trials were then presented at a level not more than 6 dB of the calibration sound. This ensured that the stimuli were clearly audible at a comfortable suprathreshold level. All audio tasks reported in this study involved stimulus presentation followed by a request for a button-click response (classic n-alternatives forced-choice trials). Feedback was provided in all audio tasks except the headphone screening using a green thumbs up for correct responses, and a red thumbs down for incorrect responses. Each audio trial was implemented using a modified version of the \"audio-button-response\" plugin, where the modification using javascript was done to disable (grey out) the response buttons until the audio was done playing. Because all audio tasks had a similar structure and used the same jsPsych plugins, the Django app (described below) was set up to take a JSON format (https://www.json.org/) text file with stimulus information and automatically convert it to appropriate jsPsych javascript code.",

While compliance can generally be expected, it is possible that some participants do not comply and instead use either single-channel headphones/earphones or free-field speakers. Therefore, to objectively check for stereo headphone use, we used a combination of two tasks (six trials each). In the first task, participants were instructed to identify the softest of a sequence of three low-frequency tones. The target tone was 6 dB softer than the two foil tones, but one of the foil tones was presented with opposite phases to the left and right channels (Woods et al., 2017) . Woods et al. (2017) reasoned that if a participant used a pair of free field speakers, acoustic cancellation would result in a greater attenuation of this \"antiphase\" foil tone compared to the target, which would cause the subject to report the wrong tone as the softest. While this is true to some extent for typical two-channel free field speakers, in general, the effectiveness of the acoustic cancellation would depend on the speaker configuration and the physical set up (e.g., distance, orientation, number of channels etc.). Crucially, if the participant used a single-channel free-field speaker or just one-channel headphone/earphone, the foil would be ineffective. To catch participants who use a single channel set up, we added a second task where participants had to report whether a low-frequency chirp (150-400",

Importantly, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) was chosen such that the chirp would be difficult to detect with just one channel, but easily detected with binaural headphones owing to the so-called binaural masking level difference (BMLD) effect that would yield a substantial masking release (Licklider, 1948) . The use of a low-frequency chirp was advantageous in two ways: (1) If a subject used two-channel free-field speakers, not only would the BMLD benefit be absent, but the same acoustic cancellation effect as described in Woods et al.

Participants had to correctly respond to five out of six trials in each task to pass the headphone screening and proceed to the other tasks in the study. One exception to this was the study used to validate our hearing-screening procedures where we explicitly sought to recruit individuals with a diagnosis of audiometric hearing loss; the cut-off was relaxed to four out of six trials for that cohort.

Our interpretation of Prolific's current policies (which we fully support) was that we can only exclude participants mid-way through a study without pay if there is clear evidence of noncompliance with instructions or clear evidence of inattentive engagement. However, the headphone checks of the nature used in this study cannot be expected to have 100% sensitivity and specificity. Indeed, it is possible that a small number of participants fail the headphone screening even if they comply with the instructions to use stereo headphones. This could happen if for instance, unbeknownst to the subject, their headphone (or computer settings) did not separate left and right channels adequately, or if they had asymmetric hearing loss, or if they did not understand the task well enough right from the first trial to meet threshold for passing. Thus, when a participant failed headphone screening, the Django app concluded the study and showed a debriefing page explaining that we were unable to verify headphone use (\"quality check failed\") and instructed the participant to \"return\" the study to Prolific. Such participants were manually compensated for the time spent on the headphone screening (compensation amount tracked by the Django app) using the \"bonus payment\" feature on Prolific.",

Thus, while conventional threshold audiometry is infeasible without calibrated hardware, such suprathreshold tasks may plausibly be used to screen for hearing loss. Indeed, identification of spoken digits in background noise has been validated for hearing screening via telephone in many countries by comparing the threshold SNR for digit identification to audiometric thresholds (Smits et al., 2004; Watson et al., 2012) . Along the same lines, we developed hearing screening procedures using material from the modified rhyme test/MRT (House et al., 1963) presented in 4-talker babble. The MRT materials include 50 lists of monosyllabic words, where each list consists of six monosyllabic word alternatives that differ in just the first or the last phoneme. The MRT is thus convenient for administration with a web-based interface by virtue of allowing for a 6alternatives forced choice response. Despite the closed-set nature of the response, the MRT is known to capture the suprathreshold deficits resulting from hearing loss (Elkins, 1971; Bell et al., 1972; Brungart et al., 2014) . To use the MRT-in-babble as a hearing screener, suitable cutoff scores must be determined below which an individual would be considered as failing the screening. Any given performance cutoff represents a tradeoff between sensitivity and specificity for detecting hearing loss, with the precise tradeoff relationship dependent on the effect size of hearing loss on speech-in-noise scores. To determine a suitable performance cutoff, we conducted a meta analysis of 15 studies that reported speech-in-noise scores for various materials across normal-hearing listeners and individuals with hearing loss (pure tone average thresholds > 30 dB HL). Inverse variance pooling was used to estimate the effect size using the bias-corrected procedure outlined in Hedges (1982) . The efficacy of the hearing screening procedure was then validated by measuring the pass rates among individuals with a history of hearing loss as diagnosed by an audiologist or otologist.",

This is because the actual selectivity of our web-based hearing screening was separately quantified by applying the chosen cutoffs to data from a cohort of individuals with a diagnosis of hearing loss. The number of studies (i.e., 15) included in the analysis was also considered adequate because the effect size was estimable with a narrow confidence interval ( Figure 2A ) using bias-corrected inverse variance pooling procedures (Hedges, 1982) . The meta-analysis revealed a large effect size of g = 2.05 based on the pooled-variance estimate (Figure 2A) , and that the standard deviation of scores in the HL group was a factor of three larger than the standard deviation in the NH group. Using this standard deviation ratio and overall effect-size estimate, it is possible to theoretically calculate the receiver-operator characteristics (ROC curves) that can be expected when using a cutoff procedure to blindly classify the hearing status of an individual participant. This theoretical ROC curve is shown in Figure 2B . These initial estimates suggested that if we choose a cutoff such that we exclude 20-40% of NH participants, we would be able to exclude around 90% of participants with hearing loss. Because our initial pool in web-based testing would likely include some participants with hearing loss, and because it is possible that web-based procedures yield larger across-participant variance, we chose our initial cutoff conservatively to exclude 35% (i.e., closer to 40% rather than 20%) of the entry pool. Accordingly, our hearing screening procedure deemed participants who scored 100% at 10 dB SNR, \u2265 83% at 5 dB SNR, and \u2265 75% at 0 dB SNR to have \"normal\" hearing. Note that setting performance cutoffs on a task also inherently filters for participants showing good compliance with instructions and focused attention. To further filter for focused engagement, we also eliminated any participants who registered more than two \"blur\" events during the course of this 6-7 minute long MRT test. This was possible because jsPsych automatically records a few different kinds of user interaction events. A \"blur\" event occurs when the user clicks on another window or tab during the experiment, indicating that they are no longer interacting with the experiment. between sensitivity and specificity for the detection of hearing loss. This was used to determine cutoff scores for the hearing screening procedure. (C) Actual selectivity of our hearing screening procedure was quantified in a cohort of subjects with a professional (clinical) diagnosis of hearing loss. Sensitivity for any degree of HL was about 81%. Sensitvitiy for more-than-mild HL (i.e., moderate, moderately-severe, or severe) was > 95%.

Of this pool of N = 72 participants, only 19% exceeded our cutoff (i.e., the overall sensitivity for detecting any degree of HL was about 81%). An examination of the degree of HL among those who passed our hearing screening revealed that the majority of hearing-impaired participants that our test failed to catch only had a mild HL. Specifically, while 31% of subjects reporting a clinical diagnosis mild HL were able to meet cutoff, only 3% those with more-than-mild HL (i.e., clinical diagnosis moderate, moderately severe, or severe HL combined) were able to meet cutoff ( Figure 2C ). Taken together our results confirm that we obtain > 65% specificity (by choice of cutoff, less than 35% of NH individuals will fail hearing screening), > 80% sensitivity for correctly excluding subjects with any degree of HL, and > 95% sensitivity for correctly excluding subjects with more-than-mild HL.

Fundamental frequency (F0) discrimination was tested for a harmonic complex tone with an F0 of 110 Hz, using stimulus parameters resembling a recent large-scale lab-based study (Madsen et al., 2017) . Specifically, F0 difference limens were measured using a three-interval 3-alternative forced-choice (3AFC) paradigm. Each interval consisted of a sequence of four 200 ms-long complex tones ramped on and off using 20 ms-long Hann tapers. The first and third tone in the target interval had a symmetric F0 shift centered at 110 Hz. All four tones in the two foil intervals had a constant F0 of 110 Hz. F0 difference sensitivity was measured for each participant using the method of constant stimulus for various values of F0 shift from 0.05 Hz to 3.2 Hz in geometric steps. Psychometric functions were fitted using a bayesian approach with a beta-binomial model (Sch\u00fctt et al., 2016) . Numerical integration procedures implemented in Psignifit 4 were used to estimate threshold, slope, and lapse-rate parameters using the default priors in the software, and with chance level set to 33% (Sch\u00fctt et al., 2016) . The average and 95% (posterior) confidence interval for the F0 difference limen, defined as the 70% point on psychometric function, were estimated ( Figure 3A ). The F0-difference limen was about 0.4%, showing that the exquisite F0 sensitivity of typical normal-hearing human subjects was estimable using web-based testing. These results are a close match to lab-based estimates (Madsen et al., 2017) . . F0 discmination limens were around 0.4% for F0 = 110 Hz, and gap thresholds were around 4 ms, consistent with lab-based data with similar stimuli.

To this end, we probed absolute sensitivity to interaural cues. Humans are known to be sensitive to interaural time differences in low-frequency sounds that are an order of magnitude or more smaller than the width of typical neural spikes (about 1 ms), and sensitive to interaural level differences that occur in the environment for a source that is displaced from the azimuthal center by as few as a couple of degrees for high-frequency sounds (Moore, 2012) . We sought to test whether such sensitivity can be robustly demonstrated with web-based testing. Interaural time difference (ITD) sensitivity for 500 Hz tones was assessed using a two-interval task where the leading ear was switched between the intervals. Participants were asked to report whether the sound jumped from left-to-right or right-to-left in a 2-alternative forced choice (2AFC) design. Accuracy was measured for ITD values ranging from 2 microseconds to 128 microseconds in geometric steps. Psychometric curves were fitted using the bayesian approach as before for data collected from N = 200 subjects who had passed our screening procedures. ITD thresholds (defined as 75% correct points) in the vicinity of 25 microseconds were obtained ( Figure 4A ), consistent with classic literature (Zwislocki and Feldman, 1956; Klumpp and Eady, 1956 ). Along the same lines, interaural level difference (ILD) sensitivity for 4 kHz tones was assessed using a two-interval task, where the ear with the more intense tone was switched between the intervals. As with the ITD task, participants were asked to report whether the sound jumped from left-to-right or right-to-left (2AFC). Data from N = 200 subjects revealed that ILD thresholds were around 0.8 dB, consistent with classic literature (Mills, 1960) . The psychometric data for ITD and ILD detection are shown in Figure 4 and confirm the validity of web-based testing for probing sensitivity to binaural cues.",

One acoustic cue that promotes the grouping of different components of a sound source into a single perceptual object is co-modulation (Darwin, 1997) . Indeed, it is thought that masker sounds that contain acoustic components that are temporally coherent with a target source will perceptually interfere with target perception (Shamma et al., 2011; Viswanathan et al., 2021) . The phenomenon of comodulation masking release (CMR) using simple tone-in-noise stimuli is thought to capture aspects of such co-modulation based scene analysis. For tones masked by on-frequency noise, the addition of flanking bands of noise, or a widening of the bandwidth of the on-frequency masking noise significantly improves the detection thresholds for the target tones, but only if the different masker frequency components are co-modulated (Schooneveldt and Moore, 1989) . Qualitatively, co-modulated masker components are perceived as a single broadband object thereby allowing for the target (narrowband) tone to stand out. Here, we tested whether the CMR effect can be illustrated using web-based psychoacoustic measurements.",

We then evaluated web-based psychoacoustics by comparing data from web-screened participants to lab-based data from individuals with known audiometric status, and found excellent agreement.",

            "text": "Remote psychoacoustic testing can help overcome many challenges with lab-based testing. One important example of a challenge that remote testing can help mitigate is the restrictions on in-person experiments during the COVID-19 pandemic. Other key advantages of remote testing include the ability to collect large datasets at lower costs, the ability to include diverse and representative cohorts of subjects, to reach and serve certain groups who may otherwise find themselves excluded from lab-based research in the convenience of their homes, and the ability to do longitudinal training or monitoring over extended periods. While a range of approaches can be adopted within the remote-testing umbrella (Peng et al., 2020) , the present study focused on web-based testing on anonymous participants using their own devices and web browsers in whatever listening environments were available to them. Other remotetesting possibilities that allow for greater hardware control include shipping lab-calibrated hardware to remote participants such as tablets/smartphones and a headphone (Lelo de Larrea-Mancera et al., 2020), or having participants install apps on specific consumer-grade devices with known average acoustic characteristics. We chose to focus on browser-based testing here because it requires minimal co-operation from subjects for installing specialized software and is easily scalable to a range of devices and operating systems. Although browser-based testing is perhaps the least controlled of remote testing options, our results using carefully designed procedures show that excellent outcomes can be obtained with such webbased testing. One potential limitation of our study is that our validation experiments did not directly assess the viability of web-based testing for between-subject comparisons. However, the fact that our hearing screening procedures can separate groups with normal hearing and hearing loss is encouraging in this respect.",
