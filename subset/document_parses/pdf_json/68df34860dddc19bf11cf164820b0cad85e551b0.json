These patients were divided into two groups; group 1 had a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 nucleic acid-positive duration for more than 15 days (n = 6) and group 2 had a nucleic acid-positive duration for less than 15 days (n = 12).

Fortunately, there are many similarities between SARS and COVID-19 patients (for example: fever, dry cough, pulmonary infiltrates, lymphopenia, elevated cytokines, immune cells infiltration) [7, 9, [14] [15] [16] . Probably because SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are both coronaviruses, they were able to bind the angiotensin I converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor in the target cells during invasion despite their different genome sequences [12, 17, 18] . Thus, it is important to further study SARS and SARS-CoV. In SARS patients, researchers had discovered reduction of lymphocytes, T cell and its subsets, B cells and natural killer (NK) cells in acute phase and restoration of these immune cells after recovery [19, 20] . Severe lung injury of SARS patients was believed to result from immune dysregulation which was commonly seen in prolonged virus clearance [21] . Importantly, the decrease of T cell and its subsets were associated with the severity of SARS patients [20, 22] . A recent study displayed that transplantation of ACE2mesenchymal stem cells could improve the outcome of COVID-19 patients by immunoregulation [23] . These results suggested the importance of immune cells in antivirual process. In our study, we also observed decreased B cells (5/15 of patients), NK cells (10/15 of patients), T cells (11/15 of patients), CD4 + T cells (12/15 of patients), CD8 + T cells (11/15 of patients), and lymphocytes (11/15 of patients). And the number of T cells but not B cells or NK cells at diagnosis was negatively correlated with the nucleic acidpositive duration.
