Indeed, the Chief Medical Officer has described exercise as a 'miracle cure' (McNally, 2015) . We know exercise is beneficial for the general population and this is also the case for people with severe mental health problems. There is evidence that exercise can be an effective treatment for improving mental health symptoms across a broad range of diagnoses (Ashdown-Franks et al., 2020) . Yet levels of physical activity in people with severe mental health problems are typically very low and contribute towards the higher incidence of physical health problems and premature mortality (Firth et al., 2019) .",

During this pandemic, there are likely to be additional barriers to increasing activity at the very time it may be most beneficial in alleviating physical and psychological stresses. For example, anxiety about leaving the house, the closure of gym facilities, and less opportunity to exercise with others. Whilst increasing physical activity has not traditionally been within the remit of psychological therapists in mental health services, it has been recognized that this may be an important modifiable factor for the improvement of mental health through COVID-19 (Diamond & Willan, 2020) and should be a focus of future research and endeavour (Holmes et al., 2020) . In the shifting landscape of the COVID-19 crisis, new priorities for treatment are emerging for which psychologists already have applicable skills. We propose that psychological therapists should engage in this area, and consider including physical activity as a treatable clinical target.",

If a behaviour is rewarded with a positive consequence, we are more likely to repeat it. Whilst many people experience immediate reward from exercising (release of 'feel good' hormones; endorphins, dopamine, and serotonin), others may find it uncomfortable or aversive, especially if they are not used to exercise, have physical health problems, or are overweight. Psychologists can utilize pacing and activity scheduling to help someone choose the right amount of activity for them (e.g., by starting slowly) and explore ways of making sure that the experience was rewarding and not aversive.",

Problem-solving may be especially difficult during lockdown, when the usual resources or familiar routines are not available. Tackling barriers collaboratively during therapy may assist. This includes generating multiple possible solutions and considering the advantages and disadvantages of each. This can facilitate the choice and testing of a solution, breaking the feeling of deadlock or 'stuckness'. This may include identifying innovative methods to be active in the home, such as accessing online exercise classes, or working out how to maintain distancing whilst exercising outside the house. This problem-solving approach has been used effectively to promote physical activity in many different populations (Lakerveld et al., 2013) (Allen, Whittemore, & Melkus, 2011) .",

This may provide the client and therapy process a 'quick win', improving mental health, well-being, sense of confidence and selfefficacy. After this initial piece of work, therapy focussed on other targets may ensue. We recommend maintaining awareness of physical activity levels throughout therapy, in the same way one might routinely 'check in' on mood or risk. We believe that the benefits of this for physical and mental health could be substantial, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic.",

At a time in which physical activity is so much needed and yet so challenging to perform, every health care worker has a role in encouraging it. Psychologists are uniquely placed to assist with this by applying their knowledge of psychological theory and therapeutic tools. These could be implemented directly to help their own clients or to share with other members of multi-disciplinary teams so that a wider group of clients can benefit. COVID-19 is demanding flexibility and creativity to adapt care across the whole health care service. Now is the time for psychologists to apply their relevant skills to a target that has the potential to deliver both mental and physical benefits when these are most needed.",
