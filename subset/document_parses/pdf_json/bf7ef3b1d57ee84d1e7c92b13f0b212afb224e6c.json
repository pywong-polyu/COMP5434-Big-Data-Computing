This study examines a clinical, residential sample of 939 adolescents and young adults ages 10 to 23 years old (M = 15.84, SD = 1.53; 97.7% white, 99.5% non-Hispanic, 55% female). The final model found that family conflict, parental criticism, verbal bullying, and interactions with friends were associated with depressive symptoms in the expected directions, and there were significant interactions with family, peer, and demographic variables. However, most associations with suicide risk were indirect. Associations involving family factors, peer factors, depressive symptoms, and suicide are not always straightforward, and should be understood within a microsystemic context.",

Division of Violence Prevention, 2015) . Although the causes for suicide are multifactorial, most cases are linked to psychopathology (Gould & Kramer, 2001) , and particularly to depression. As depression also continues to rise among adolescents and young adults (Mojtabai et al., 2016) , it is important to develop an understanding of factors that may contribute to, or buffer against, depressive symptoms and/or suicide risk in order to prevent the continued acceleration of these interconnected threats. Social relationships with family and peers have been identified as particularly important categories of risk and protective factors (e.g., Sun & Hui, 2007) , but most research has examined these factors as a few independent indicators of risk, rather than as a complex and interactive microsystem. This method limits both theoretical understanding and applicability of findings to improvements in identification and treatment of at-risk youth. Therefore, the current study seeks to explore unique and complex associations (such as non-linear associations or interactions) between family and peer factors with depressive symptoms and suicide risk in a high-risk residential sample.",

            "text": "The microsystemic social environments of adolescents and young adults have a profound effect on psychological development (Vieno et al., 2007) . Ecological models (e.g., Bronfenbrenner, 1977) of development and health illustrate the influence of context on individual health and psychosocial well-being. Such models encourage the examination of both proximal and distal factors surrounding a person to understand the interrelatedness of multiple embedded systems of influence (e.g., culture, society, neighborhood, family networks). Extant research suggests that there are two critical microsystems that are especially important for understanding common but pervasive mental health symptoms (e.g., depressive symptoms, suicide risk) in adolescents: the family and the peer group. The quality of relationships with family and peers are particularly potent factors contributing to risk for depression and suicide . Close and trusting relationships with family members and peers build support (B\u00f6gels & Brechman-Toussaint, 2006; Drake & Ginsburg, 2012) , facilitate coping (Compas et al., 2017) , and promote a sense of belonging (Vitaro et al., 2009 ). The opposite is also true: when adolescents and young adults experience conflict with their families and isolation from peers, this contributes to stress and impacts psychosocial functioning (Orben et al., 2020; Sheeber et al., 2001) . Indeed, family and peer factors have been associated not only with the development of clinically-relevant symptoms (Prinstein et al., 2000) but also with treatment trajectories and outcomes (Baker & Hudson, 2013; Rapp et al., 2021) .",

            "text": "Family factor research has identified several specific and potentially important risk factors that may help prevent or contribute to the development of depressive symptoms and associated suicide risk in adolescents and young adults. First, parental criticism can be a potent risk factor; youth who perceive high levels of parental criticism are at increased risk for depression (Rapp et al., 2021) and suicidal thoughts and behaviors (Campos et al., 2013) . Similarly, conflict in the home is robustly associated with depressive symptoms (Rice et al., 2006) and suicide risk (Randell et al., 2006) . Furthermore, a lack of perceived parental support is consistently associated with risk for developing depression (Baetens et al., 2015) as well as risk for suicide attempts (Sheftall et al., 2013) . Finally, youth who perceive less parental monitoring (e.g., not being aware of the youth's whereabouts) may be at greater risk for depression (Yu et al., 2006) . Importantly, longitudinal studies suggest that psychological symptoms often follow, not precede, these types of family factors (Cummings et al., 2015) . That is, family conflict and criticism may be risk factors (and family support and monitoring protective factors) for later development of psychological symptoms, and these associations are not merely reflecting deterioration in close family relationships following the onset of symptoms.",

            "text": "Positive and negative experiences with peers can also influence psychological well-being, including risk for depressive symptoms and suicide. Positive experiences, such as friendships, have small, but consistent, negative associations with depressive symptoms (Schwartz-Mette et al., 2020) . Longitudinal research suggests that high-quality friendships may protect against later depression symptoms (Jacobson & Newman, 2016) , whereas lack of friendships and feelings of isolation may damage youth psychosocial health (Ueno, 2005; Vitaro et al., 2009) . Negative experiences, such as bullying (verbal, physical, and cyberbullying) are also associated with depressive symptoms and suicide risk over time (Brunstein Klomek et al., 2007; Kaltiala-Heino et al., 2009) . Notably, it is important to distinguish between different types of bullying, such as physical and cyberbullying, which may have different associations with depressive symptoms (Wang et al., 2011) . However, these family and peer factors should not be understood as simply a collection of factors that may be added and subtracted to understand individual risk of depressive symptoms or suicide. First, much of this research has examined family and peer factors separately, without accounting for possible overlap (unique associations). This makes it difficult to determine which factors may be the most important. Second, and even more crucially, more complex effects like interactions and non-linear associations have been underexplored. While many studies suggest direct, linear relationships between family and peer factors and youth mental health, others suggest that, in actuality, these mechanisms interact in complex ways (Bradley & Corwyn, 2000; Ciairano et al., 2007) . For example, one study found that supportive peer relationships were associated with lower depressive symptoms only under conditions of low family support. These supportive peer relationships were associated with an increase in depressive symptoms for adolescents with a high degree of family support (Barrera & Garrison-Jones, 1992) . Interestingly, other studies have found the opposite: supportive peer relationships were only associated with lower depressive symptoms under conditions of low family conflict (Ciairano et al., 2007) . Some studies also suggest that family factors may have curvilinear, rather than linear, associations with psychological outcomes. For example, poor family control (e.g., lack of parental monitoring) may be a risk factor for poor adjustment, but higher levels of family control have diminishing returns (Kurdek & Fine, 1994) . Therefore, examining factors in isolation and excluding the possibility of non-linear and interactive associations may lead to incorrect conclusions about the role of family and peer factors in depressive symptoms and suicide risk.",

However, for this examination to be meaningful for research, theory, and practice, it is important to account for a few additional considerations. First, studies suggest the effects of family and peer factors on youth mental health may be moderated not only by other social relationship factors but also by demographic factors. Gender appears to be a particularly salient moderator in previous research (Kerr et al., 2006; Lewis et al., 2015) ; depressive symptoms are more common among girls than boys, and differentiated social roles for boys and girls may result in family and peer factors affecting youth differently (Parker & Brotchie, 2010) . Second, the majority of the research that examines combined and complex effects of family and peer factors has only considered depressive symptoms, not suicide risk (Hawton et al., 2013) . As these outcomes are often linked, it is critical to determine whether these family and peer factors are uniquely related to suicide or primarily through increases in depressive symptoms. Finally, these associations are particularly important to explore in higher-risk clinical populations, due both to the severity of risk and the potential for differences in how family and peer factors are associated with risk in clinical samples, compared to more general youth and young adult samples (e.g., Queen et al., 2013) .",

Furthermore, based on previous research and theoretical understanding, non-linear and interactive effects are anticipated between these factors, which must be understood to draw conclusions about the true effects of these family and peer factors. Based on previous research, interactions are also anticipated with demographic factors, which may shed light on which family and peer factors may be uniquely important for certain demographic groups. Finally, given the association between depressive symptoms and suicide risk, at least some associations between family and peer factors with suicide risk are expected to be mediated by depressive symptoms.",

There is a similar finding for cyberbullying; among those never cyberbullied, female respondents have increased depressive symptoms, but there is no difference among those \"sometimes\" or \"often\" cyberbullied. The two interactions between bullying and friendship are plotted (without control variables) in Fig. 2 . Both suggest that youth \"often\" spending time with friends are at lower risk for depressive symptoms only if they are never physically or cyberbullied.",

Therefore, family and peer factors that emerged as particularly salient in this sample are Fig. 1 Interactions of family and peer factors with gender likely to be relevant for identifying those adolescents and young adults at greatest risk for severe outcomes. Although this is a cross-sectional study, better understanding of these factors may lead to advances in prevention, intervention, and treatment. Particularly in the era of COVID-19, which has greatly disrupted interpersonal relationships (Orben et al., 2020) , the robust association of interactions with friends with depressive symptoms suggests that methods for developing and maintaining these potentially protective relationships are crucial for the psychological health of adolescents and young adults. Finally, the methodology of the current study also follows recent recommendations involving the use of data-driven approaches to examine multiple variables and complex relationships (Franklin et al., 2017) . Given the difficulty in predicting suicide and other severe consequences of depressive symptoms, studies that examine multiple interactive risk factors are crucial for advancing understanding of how these relational processes may influence psychological well-being (Hawton et al., 2013; Restifo & B\u00f6gels, 2009 ).",

Second, only patient report with single items was used; multi-informant methods could also be used to gain a better understanding of relational processes beyond the patient's own report. Third, this study utilized a cross-sectional approach, and conclusions about directions of effects cannot be supported. Previous longitudinal research suggests that family and peer risk factors often predate mental health symptoms (Cummings et al., 2015; Jacobson & Newman, 2016) , but these associations are also likely to be bidirectional. Similarly, indirect effects suggested potential mediating pathways of family and peer factors on suicide risk through depressive symptoms, but these should not be interpreted causally. Finally, given the complex, multifactorial causes of suicide (Franklin et al., 2017) , it is crucial for future research examining more proximal family and peer factors to include other categories of risk factors, including genetic factors (Levey et al., 2019) and family context (Denney, 2010) , which may interact with the microsystemic social environment and depressive symptoms. The current findings have implications for understanding how family factors related to depressive symptoms in adolescence and young adulthood. First, negative family experiences, including parental criticism and family conflict, emerged as particularly relevant for depressive symptoms. This echoes previous research (Rapp et al., 2021) , but further suggests that these effects are unique; that is, independent of factors like family support, these two types of negative family experience appear to pose distinct risks. On the other hand, although the association between conflict and depressive symptoms was in the expected direction, family conflict appeared to share a negative association with suicide risk after accounting for depressive symptoms (i.e., higher conflict was associated with lower risk), suggesting more complex processes worthy of further investigation (e.g., family detachment).",

Other studies have found mixed results regarding parental monitoring (Yap et al., 2014) , and it is possible that other assessments of parental involvement may be more appropriate for older adolescents or young adults. Family support was measured by inquiring about interactional frequency (i.e., how often youth spoke with adult family members about their concerns). While measures of interactional frequency might indicate support in normative samples, families of distressed youth may be more likely to fail to respond to support-seeking or to respond negatively (Gambin et al., 2015; Preyde et al., 2011) .

In this study, interactions with friends and verbal bullying emerged as particularly salient processes for depressive symptoms. The role of peers becomes increasingly more important in adolescence and young adulthood (Magson et al., 2021; Neale et al., 2018) , and feelings of acceptance or isolation from peers can be highly consequential for youth mental health. The moderation of interactions with friends by bullying (or vice versa) suggests youth with both frequent interactions with friends, and the absence of bullying, are especially unlikely to endorse depressive symptoms. On the other hand, the benefits of friendships were not moderated by family factors, in contrast to previous research (Barrera & Garrison-Jones, 1992) . However, these interactive effects have been less robust in more severe, clinical samples, perhaps due to the greater likelihood and severity of family dysfunction in these populations (Kerr et al., 2006) . In the presence of these dysfunctional families, peers may serve a particularly important role in providing support and stability to distressed youth. Finally, only verbal bullying was directly relevant for depressive symptoms; this is somewhat surprising given previous research suggesting that cyberbullying poses a particularly large risk for depression (Wang et al., 2011) .",

            "text": "Family and peer factors are known to be associated with youth depressive symptoms and suicide risk, but most studies examine these factors in relative isolation and without accounting for their interdependence. Without acknowledging the context in which family and peer relationship factors emerge, it is difficult to estimate the unique contributions of factors like support and conflict, particularly when the effects are not linear or depend on the levels of another factor. The current study analyzed unique, interactive, and non-linear effects of several peer and family factors associated with depressive symptoms and suicide risk in a high-risk residential sample of adolescents and young adults. Building on previous research, the current results suggest that negative family processes (like conflict and criticism) and verbal bullying, are associated with more severe, and interactions with friends less severe, depressive symptoms. Moreover, gender differences were mediated by family support and cyberbullying, and interactions with friends by physical bullying, suggesting that examining individual peer and family factors in isolation may produce misleading results. Contrary to expectations, however, few factors were directly associated with suicide risk, but several shared possible indirect pathways through depressive symptoms. These results underscore the difficulty in identifying youth with suicide risk, but also provide directions for advances in identification, research, and treatment. For high-risk adolescents and young adults, negative aspects of the family environment may be likely to outweigh any positives as distressed youth may receive support primarily from their peers. However, the increased importance of peer relationships also has a dark side; youth with a history of peer victimization may be at high risk of depressive symptoms even when they have frequent interactions with their friends. In sum, relational factors with implications for depression and suicide do not occur in a vacuum, and it is important to understand this complex microsystem to estimate the true impact of these factors on the psychological well-being of adolescents and young adults. supervision and resources, and helped draft the manuscript.
