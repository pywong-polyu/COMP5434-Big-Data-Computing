To help tease apart these factors, we present a large cohort of COVID-19 infections admitted to a single UK centre covering one geographical region, Surrey county, 11-13 which represents one of the most affluent and homogeneous populations in the UK. The gross regional domestic product per capita of Surrey and healthy life expectancy are both within the top UK deciles while levels of adult obesity, smoking and physical inactivity are significantly lower than the national average, 14 with 90.4% being white, 14 higher than the national average. 11",

The \u03c7 2 was used for single factor analysis of categorical variables. Independent t-test or Mann-Whitney U test was used for single factor analysis of continuous variables. Univariate and multivariate logistic regressions were used to estimate the associations of risk factors with COVID-19 status. The subset of risk factor providing the best fit to the data, among all the possible models, was selected using stepwise model selection by number of criteria: Akaike information criterion (AIC), Bayesian information criterion, Mallow's Cp, residual mean square, a leave-one-out cross-validation, receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC curve), Youden index and conditional analysis. To check how sample size affects the results of variable selection procedure, we randomly selected a proportion of the original dataset to apply the stepwise AIC procedure used in the main analysis and repeated the procedure 1000 times. The significance threshold is a trade-off between avoidance of false-positive associations while considering the likely higher prior of association because of the nature of the array. However, there are high correlations between pairs variables, therefore, the Bonferroni correction would be too conservative for the analysis. In addition, type-I errors are random, and patterns in results that confirm previous reports should be given more weight than isolated results with a single low p value. Correction for multiple comparisons largely increases the likelihood of type-II errors and important differences considered non-significant. To consider this, for individual tests of association, rather than applying a correction for multiple testing at global significance level, defined statistical significance as 0.01. Analyses and graphics were performed and produced using R V.4.0.0.",

            "text": "One possible explanation for similar rates of adverse outcomes as cohorts elsewhere in UK is that hospitalised patients had a high level of recognised risk factors, even if these features were less common as a whole relative to the national average. This is seen in the demographic structure of admitted cases, with the average age being 70 years old, and men accounting for 56% these profiles previously associated with adverse outcomes 7 18 and comparable in proportion to those recorded from a UK-wide survey of COVID-19-hospitalised cases (median age: 72 years; 60% men). 19 Additionally, the proportion of non-whites, a further risk for mortality, 16 accounted for a disproportionately greater fraction of admissions (27.5%), than in Surrey as a whole (10%); while the rate of relevant comorbidities (eg, cardiovascular disease) was as high in our cohort as in other UK cohorts, although the numbers represented by each ethnic group is relatively low. 17 Thus, the high-risk profile of hospitalised Surrey cohort patients helps to explain why their rate of adverse outcomes is similar to those reported in more deprived areas. Our results also suggest that inter-regional differences in COVID-19 outcome (eg, higher death rate in deprived areas) 8 are more likely to be due to differences in frequencies of personal risk factors, rather than due Open access to variations in local healthcare structure, capability or intensive care capacity.",

            "text": "Data from the Intensive Care National Audit and Research Centre showed that a third of patients with COVID-19 admitted to critical care units are from an ethnic minority background. 20 21 Of 2249 patients admitted to 201 critical care units in England, 64.8% were white, 13.8% were Asian, 13.6% were black and 7.8% were from other or mixed ethnic groups. Importantly, these unadjusted descriptive data take no account of factors other than ethnicity that could influence the risk of critical care admission. Ethnic minority groups have also been disproportionately affected by COVID-19 in the USA, highlighting potential racial, economic and other inequalities. 20 An analysis by the Washington Post reports that those counties with black majorities have three times the rate of COVID-19 cases and almost six times the rate of deaths, compared with counties where white residents are in the majority. 20 However, unlike the UK, the US experience may be influenced by the lack of universal healthcare and caution is required when extrapolating across different health systems. The higher observed incidence and severity in minority groups may be associated with socioeconomic, cultural or lifestyle factors, genetic predisposition or pathophysiological differences in susceptibility or response to infection. Possible susceptibilities include an increased risk of admission for acute respiratory tract infections, 22 an increased prevalence of Vitamin D deficiency, 23 vaccination policies in their country of birth and immune effects, 20 increased inflammatory burden and higher prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors such as insulin resistance and obesity than white populations. 24 Some of these are also risk factors for increased disease severity in COVID-19. 20 25 In other respects, the characteristics and prognostic factors of our COVID-19 cohort were broadly similar to those described in cohorts from more diverse regions, with lower economic and health status. 17 A third of admissions were apyrexial; one-third had no cough and 15% had neither a cough or fever, indicating that a sizeable fraction of hospitalised cases do not meet current NHS England clinical criteria for suspected COVID-19 infection. 26 Indeed, the absence of a cough and fever was associated with a poorer outcome. Fever is the most common symptom among mild to moderate cases. [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] However, the frequency varied among the studies. In the largest cohort study in Europe, fever was presented in 45.4% of the cases, 33 while in the two largest studies in China, it was present at more than 80% 35 36 . Cough was the second most common symptom observed in all studies. [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] The frequency with which it was observed varied among studies, and it was up to 63.2% in the largest European study 33 and between 48.7% 36 Open access and 46% of the systematic review of paediatric studies. 31 The biological mechanism of absence of fever or cough is unclear. It is possible that failure to mount an immune response is the reason for the poor outcome in the absence of fever or cough.",

Of those admitted to ICU, 47.6% died, compared with 28.4% who received ward-based care. This is line with national data (45%) 19 and compares to a broad international range early Chinese data 16%-78%, Italy 26%, USA 50%. 19 44-46 Our modelling data predict six factors that account for 86% of the mortality variance with age being the best predictor, accounting for 72% of the model by itself (table 2) . One prognostic association in our cohort that differs from other reports [46] [47] [48] is that BMI was not a statistically significant factor predicting mortality, despite the average BMI of admitted patients being raised (28 kg/m 2 ). In fact, we found that raised BMI shows a trend towards protection in women. An obesity survival paradox with pneumonia has previously been described 49 and may arise because of more aggressive treatment provided to these patients or increased metabolic reserve enabling prolonged treatment in intensive care. The fact that 'protective obesity' was found only in women suggests there may also be some role of or difference in sex hormones and fat deposition patterns. Another reason for discrepancies between reports in the effect of BMI on survival may arise from the method by which BMI was measured. Using a different measure of obesity ('recognised by clinical staff') led to a significantly positive association with mortality, as observed elsewhere. 19 There are several limitations to our study. First, as we are still early in our epidemic, 10.5% patients do not yet have final outcomes established, but our sample size of those who do have an established outcome is still greater than many other UK COVID-19 cohorts. While we recognise that the cohort was drawn from a region with high socioeconomic status, it is difficult to know the extent of this status in individual patients. However, Surrey represents the greatest proportion of high socioeconomic status residents compared with anywhere else in the UK. Although we show a high rate of admission to hospital for patients from different ethnic backgrounds there is no overall outcome difference, this result must be interpreted with caution as the number of patients from any ethnic group was limited.",
