[18, 19] , yet the rates of HPV vaccination remain low as compared to other adolescent vaccinations. Pre-COVID 19 pandemic averages of HPV vaccine completion rates in the US were low (54.2%) [20] and with the pandemic, the rates of all immunizations, including HPV vaccinations, have dropped even more, putting millions of children at risk for developing persistent HPV infections, genital warts, and life-threatening HPV-related cancers later in life [21] . This decrease in vaccination rates further drives the need to have more channels to aid in vaccine distribution and build vaccine confidence. Since dental providers screen their adult patients annually for oral cancers, and given the established association between HPV and oropharyngeal cancers, these providers should be able to administer HPV vaccinations to their younger patients to provide long-term HPV protection [22, 23] .",

However, little to no data are available on dentists and vaccination administration. Oral health providers have been wary of their scope of practice, especially in terms of being able to administer vaccines, for a variety of reasons. Lack of adequate training, storage and handling, associated cost inefficiency and current billing practices are some of the reasons why dentists do not find administering vaccines very feasible [33] . However, it is noteworthy that in the past, oral health professionals have been successfully involved in several preventive care campaigns (e.g., tobacco cessation, blood pressure and glucose monitoring, and oral cancer screenings).

Per the results of only this study, 331 vaccinators could be added to the state's vaccination workforce with such legislation. These numbers are however, rough estimates based on the dentists' willingness to consider vaccinating their patients, rather than their overall readiness to vaccinate. More than half of our study respondents were private practitioners which can be attributed to the fact that most dentists (93.6%) in the state of Indiana, work in private practices [35] . The dentists practicing in FQHCs were more agreeable to offer vaccination in their practice as compared to those in private practice and working for DSOs. It is worth mentioning that FQHCs have both medical and dental personnel working within the same facility so there may lesser value in having dentists administering vaccines. However, the reason behind this still being a great concept is because having more providers capable of administering vaccines will only improve vaccination efforts, especially if they practiced in an alternate setting. FQHCs could be an ideal example for dentists to take a lead on this as a lot of concerns related to the handling and storage of vaccines, may be better acnowledged (and less expensive) in this setting as compared to private dental offices. Additionally, FQHCs typically have an integrated medical-dental setting, which would allow for addressing side effects or anaphylactic reactions to the vaccine by nearby medical professionals.",

The reasons behind that may be: reimbursement/insurance concerns, comfort levels of the providers, and the fact that child vaccination is often coupled with a \"well-child visit,\" which may be more preferred by the parents or caregivers. The willingness of dentists to vaccinate adults over children could be a concerning issue that needs to be addressed, especially for vaccines like HPV that have shown diminishing effectiveness in older ages [18] . Younger dentists or those new in practice were more comfortable administering vaccines in children as compared to those who had been in practice for longer. Most respondents did report in the open-ended comments section their preference for required training or continuing education courses on vaccine administration for dental providers.",

The survey questions also did not separate out the different vaccines, so it is possible that providers may be comfortable offering some vaccines more than others. The cross sectional study design which had self reported information may also have social desirability bias [45] which could limit the validity of the study results. The survey responses considered in the analyses were 569, which is approximately 15% of the total number of dentists (4020) with an active license in Indiana per the reports from the Bowen Center for Health Workforce Research and Policy [35] . This also implies, 85% of the dentists in the state, did not contribute data to the study thus creating significant response bias. It's important to note that the way the survey was worded-\"consider offering vaccination\" may have a different meaning from \"willingness\" or \"readiness\", reflecting a potential weakness in the survey design.",
