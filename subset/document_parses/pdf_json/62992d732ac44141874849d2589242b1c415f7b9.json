The simulator facilitates the study of dynamics of epidemics of different infectious diseases, and has been applied to study the effects of spread vaccination and ring vaccination strategies. Fundamentally the simulator loosely simulates SIR (Susceptible Infected Removed) and SEIR (Susceptible Exposed Infected Removed). The Geo-spatial model with global interaction and our approach of global stochastic cellular automata are also discussed. The global stochastic cellular automata takes into account the demography, culture of a region. The simulator can be used to study the dynamics of disease epidemics over large geographic regions. We analyze the effects of distances and interaction on the spread of various diseases.",

With the ever-increasing population and ability to travel longer distances in short time, the spread of communicable diseases in a society has been accelerated [16, 17] . Growing diversity of the population, and globalization are leading towards increasing interaction among individuals. Constant exposure to public health threats is raising people's concern and necessitates pro-active action towards preventing disease outbreaks. Further, greater emphasis on infections and epidemics is rooted in the imminent threat arising from bioterrorism. As a result, Public Health professionals have been focusing on identifying the factors in the social, physical and epidemiological environment which aid to faster spread of diseases.",

Epidemiology deals with the study of cause, spread, and control of diseases. The goal of epidemiologists is to implement mechanisms for surveillance, monitoring, prevention and control of different diseases. To accomplish the above mentioned, epidemiologists need to deal with large data sets of disease outbreaks. These data sets are often spatially and/or temporally distributed. It is in fact ironic that, for epidemiologists to study the dynamics of different diseases, it is vital for an outbreak to occur. Epidemiologists have been studying and analyzing the data sets using primarily statistical tools. In the vast variety of infectious diseases, expertise is needed in terms of epidemiologists for every disease. Statistical tools, prove to be inadequate and fragmentary, when focusing on large spatial domains. These tools have been deemed limited, particularly in view of an emerging global computational infrastructure that facilitates high performance computing. Hence, it is imperative to develop new tools that take advantage of today's computational power, and help epidemiologists to analyze and understand the spatial spread of diseases. The computational tools also enhance the quality of information, accelerate the generation of answers to specific questions and facilitate in prediction. Such tools will take on an important role in surveillance, monitoring, prevention and control of different diseases.",

Nevertheless, in the field of modeling epidemics, this paradigm has rarely been utilized to its full potential [1, 10, 14, 8] . A cellular automata as defined by Lyman Hurd is a discrete dynamical system, where space, time, and the states of the system are distinct [15] . CA has been exemplified as an array of similar processing units called cells. The cells arranged in a regular manner constitute a regular spatial lattice. Figure 1 shows a regular lattice of cells. The fundamental property of each cell is a state, where the states of cells change based on a update rule, either local or global. The update rule is applied synchronously throughout the lattice and the state transitions of the cells are based on few of the close by cells, known as the neighborhood. For a two-dimensional lattice the most common neighborhoods defined are von Neumann and Moore neighborhood as shown in figure 1 [15] . In the von Neumann neighborhood, the state of cell C i ,j depends on the states of the four neighborhood cells namely C i+1,j , C i\u22121,j , C i,j+1 , C i,j\u22121 .

            "text": "Most of the work in modeling infectious disease epidemics is mathematically inspired and based on differential equations and SIR/SEIR model [3] . Differential equation, SIR modeling rely on the assumption of constant population and neglect the spatial effects [5, 6] . They often fail to consider individual contact/interaction process and assume populations are homogeneously mixed and do not include variable susceptibility. Considerable research has been conducted in SIR(Susceptible, Infectious, Recovered) modeling of infectious diseases using a set of differential equations. Both partial and ordinary differential equation models are so deterministic in nature that they neglect the stochastic or probabilistic behavior [8] . Nevertheless, these approaches/models have been shown to be effective in regions of small population [8] . Other approaches for modeling disease epidemics have been using mean field type approximations [12] . Even though the MFT models are similar to the differential equations, they add a probabilistic nature by adding different probabilities for the mixing among individuals. Although, according to Boccara [5] mean field approximations tend to neglect spatial dependencies and correlations and assume that the probability of the state of cell being susceptible or infective is proportional to the density of the corresponding population. This approach relies on the quantitative measures to predict local interaction. Boccara and Cheong [5] study the SIS model of spread of infectious disease in a population of moving individuals, thereby introducing non-uniform population density. In every update the cells take up a state of being either susceptible or infectious and randomly choose a cell location to move to. Ahmed et al [2] model variations in population density by allowing cyclic host movement. Other approaches in modeling variable susceptibility of the population, have been done by inducing immunity in the population. Ahmed et al [1] introduce incubation and latency time, and suggest that the parameters have an accelerating impact on the spread of a disease epidemic. Nevertheless, the underlying assumption is spontaneous infection of individuals. Boccara and Cheong [6] concentrate on SIR epidemic models and take into consideration the fluctuation in the population by births and deaths, exhibiting a cyclic behavior with primary emphasis on moving individuals. Di Stefano et al [8] have developed a lattice gas cellular automata model to analyze the spread of epidemics of infectious diseases. The model is based on individuals, where individuals can change their state independent of others and can move from one cell to other. However, this approach does not consider the infection time-line of latency, incubation period, and recovery which have been shown to be important to model a disease epidemic.",

The state of the cell changes from latent L to infectious I after being in state L for the given \u03bb. In this model we assume for simplicity, that every cell exposed to the pathogen, will become infectious. In the state I, the cells are capable of passing on the infection to neighborhood cells. For example if for a disease D, \u03bb= 2 units, then after two time steps the cell will enter the infectious state I. 3. After a time period, defined by the infectious period \u03b8, the state of the cell changes from infectious I to recovered or removed R. Once the cells enter the state R, the cell is no more capable of passing on the infection. 4. From the state R, the cell's state changes back to either susceptible S or it remain in state R, signifying complete immunity. The 'healing mode' turned on determines the transition from state R to state S and vice versa.",

The simulator is highly parameterized to let the user change and modify the above parameters. The neighborhood of every cell can be changed from a 8 neighborhood to 4 neighborhood depending on the region being simulated and the contacts among the individuals of the region. As mentioned, the infection probability represented as infectivity \u03c8 is a significant parameter for the spread of a disease. In the case of our model, \u03c8 is based on the virulence of the disease and contact rate among individuals. For some diseases individuals attain lifetime immunity, after being infected, while for disease like common cold, individuals attain temporary immunity. Thus, to take this fact into consideration, the simulator has a feature of healing mode. With the healing mode enabled the simulation is executed in a mode that forces cells to turn into susceptible after the recovery state and with healing turned off, the cell attains complete lifetime immunity. As mentioned above, the infection time-line is also an important factor in modeling a disease epidemic. Thus the time periods of latency \u03bb, infectious \u03b8, and recovery \u03c1 are all expressed as time units, for example, latency of two days, can be represented as \u03bb=2 units. The simulator allows the user step through the simulation at each time step, or execute it continuously. We will see in the next section, how changing these parameters, can change the dynamics of spread of diseases.",

The doses of vaccine available at our disposal is often limited, thus for the purpose of experiment we consider N doses of vaccine to be available to vaccinate the population, where N is about 5% of the population. In random vaccination, the N vaccines, are randomly distributed to individuals in a population, independent of the other. In the ring vaccination, individuals are vaccinated in a ring surrounding an area. The thickness and circumference of the ring depends on N.

Also, the need to simulate a disease, where an infective can spread the disease to twelve other individuals in one time step, will not be possible to simulate. Another important issue to note is the movement of people, migration, or travel is not considered. Some models, we saw in the previous section deal with movement of individuals from one cell to another in the defined neighborhood, where again the neighborhood is restricted. The saturation of neighborhood occurs due to overlapping of neighborhood, when more than one cell is infected in a neighborhood.

Thus, this depicts that the growth is rapid with \u03c8 of 15 as compared to \u03c8 of 7.Figure 5(a), shows the comparison of the different values \u03c8 s, which are 7,10,12,15. The curves represent the growth rate. The curve is much steeper for \u03c8 of 15 as compared to others. The experiment was conducted with the \u03bb= 2 units, \u03b8= 3 units and \u03c1= 2 units.
