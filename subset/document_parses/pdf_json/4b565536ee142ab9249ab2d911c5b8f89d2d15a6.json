            "text": "In recent years, the number of users who purchase products using online shopping malls has increased. The transaction volume of clothing in online shopping, including sportswear, has increased by 20% compared to the same month last year in Korea (Statistics Korea, 2020) . In this way, online reviews are one of the important factors affecting purchasing a product not only when purchasing online where you cannot experience the product directly, but also when purchasing a product offline where you can directly experience them (Goldsmith & Horowitz, 2006; Zhang et al., 2014) . Cycling has been receiving attention recently, and cycling wear is an important factor for cyclists regardless of long-distance or short-distance cycling. Especially, cycling pants that are exclusively for cycling wear are becoming essential purchase items because of their technical functionality when cycling (Downer & Cassidy, 2011) . Cycling pants are a type of compression wear that requires various functionalities in textiles, and various domestic and foreign brands have released many products. Nevertheless, their product information is insufficient for consumers to purchase. As such, cycling pants' performance is more important than fashion, but consumers feel that there is insufficient information on the product they want to purchase because it is difficult to evaluate the performance. Cyclists use online comments or reviews about cycling pants to get product information when purchasing them. However, with the recent rapid increase in reviews, consumers have to spend a lot of time reading all the comments and reviews to grasp the actual and objective information. It is becoming difficult to judge the product's information. Besides, there is a lack of evidence to judge the accuracy of these numerous reviews. Looking at the Internet usage rate by country, Korea is 95.9%, the United States is 87.3%, Japan is 84.6%, and France is 82%, and on average, 90% of all individuals are using the Internet, and their usage exceeds the OECD (KOSIS, 2020; OECD, 2017) , Although Korea has an excellent environment for consumer analysis related to Internet users, there are few studies on consumer analysis, especially cycling wear.",

However, their question is designed in advance, it is difficult to reflect various experiences of consumers (Coughlan, 2009) , and there is the possibility of bias or distortion in the response. On the other hand, with the recent development of the Internet, consumers voluntarily post product-related reviews online and share consumer feelings and discomforts in real-time, which quickly allows them to grasp the honest consumer's emotions. For this reason, the importance and essential role of reviews have been strongly emphasized year and year (Felbermayr & Nanopoulos, 2016; Kawaf & Istanbulluoglu, 2019) . In particular, high-performance products such as cycling pants are both search products and experience products, so that reviews of products have written by users after using the product will be a greater impact when consumers purchase the products.",

Text mining is a research technique that collects, processes, analyzes, and summarizes these text-type unstructured data in text format based on natural language processing technology and can extract useful information that could not be found before (Back, 2017; Feldman, 2007) . Like word of mouth that consumers hear offline, online reviews can help consumers get more reliable information about their product. Consumers can reduce the risk of purchasing and lower prices through reviews from other consumers. They found that they trusted other consumers' reviews more than advertisements and made this an important purchasing decision criterion (Goldsmith & Horowitz, 2006) . Consumers are likely to show a favorable response to the product by increasing the number of online reviews (Dhar & Chang, 2009 ) because the number of online reviews has increased consumer awareness of the product and implied the product is of interest to consumers.",

Positive keywords in luxury brands appeared 'various, ' 'famous, ' 'excellent, ' 'perfect, ' and 'luxurious' and negative keywords were 'expensive, ' 'price, ' 'old, ' 'bland, ' 'tough, ' and 'fake' (Kim & Kim, 2016) . Topic modeling of online posts on striped shirts resulted in top-level associations such as 'pattern, ' 'suits, ' and 'coordinates' (An & Park, 2017) . In swimsuits, 'size, ' 'design, ' and 'price' appeared as upper words, indicating that consumers valued the internal image rather than the external image of swimsuits (Lee et al., 2017) . Professional cycling wear demands are increasing in an internet cafe, and the important factors were 'price, ' 'size, ' and 'brand' (Kim & Yi, 2018) .

Moreover, there have been many complaints about pads in online shopping malls, and specific information on cycling pants is lacking so its improvement is required for helping the right purchase of consumers. A previous study that analyzed consumers' reviews for cycling wear online, reported that the results of text mining and the traditional questionnaire survey method on consumer perception are similar (Kim & Yi, 2018) . By analyzing unstructured data in real-time using text mining, it is expected that it will be able to understand the target market and analyze consumer requirements or characteristics. In this way, if it is analyzed online consumer reviews with text mining and use to develop a recommendation system, consumers do not have to visit various websites to search numerous reviews for product information, especially electronic word of mouth. Also, the reason for the need for text mining according to each product line is that each product's required performance is different, so text mining for each product category will provide more accurate product information to consumers. It is also necessary to have a system that converts them into quantitative data by converting them into a database by identifying synonyms and similar words of various texts that consumers use about cyclewear on the Internet and constructing a text and a stopword dictionary.",
