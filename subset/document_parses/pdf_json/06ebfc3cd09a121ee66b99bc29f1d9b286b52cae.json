Consequently, online, educational platforms are expected to provide personalized, upto-date curricula to assist learners. Therefore, in this paper, we propose an Artificial Intelligence (AI ) and Crowdsourcing based approach to create and update curricula for individual learners. We show the design of this curriculum development system prototype, in which contributors receive AI-based recommendations to be able to define and update high-level learning goals, skills, and learning topics together with associated learning content. This curriculum development system was also integrated into our personalized online learning platform. To evaluate our prototype we compared experts' opinion with our system's recommendations, and resulted in 89%, 79%, and 93% F1-scores when recommending skills, learning topics, and educational materials respectively. Also, we interviewed eight senior level experts from educational institutions and career consulting organizations. Interviewees agreed that our curriculum development method has high potential to support authoring activities in dynamic, personalized learning environments.",

We need a scalable dynamic curriculum development approach in order to be able to offer personalised education to learners.

[18] proposed an educational program model (i.e. prerequisite, content, expected outcome) based on labour market demand using AI back-propagation concept in order to help learners to up-skill themselves towards their current or desired job. Although they claim that the result of their curriculum model is promising, they focused on the single area of Internet of Things (IoT ). [12] created knowledge graphs of Open Educational Resources (OERs) by applying Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to help authors to deliver their content to the proper audience. However, they only focused on content level and not on higher level learning goals. Moreover, some researches [13, 20] proposed approaches that perform automatic quality assessment for educational resources in order to help content providers to filter out low-quality content from their resources list. [8] introduces a novel method that uses Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) [5] algorithm to extract topics covered by specific educational resources, in order to build learning pathways. Their application only focused on building curriculum for educating text mining to learners.",

Suggestion service for collecting users' suggestions on a component and also automatically accept or reject them based on crowd opinions, 3. Recommendation service for providing insights for contributors based on existing open data (e.g. job vacancies, educational resources, and standard taxonomies) in order to help them adding and updating content.

Afterwards, our system recommends a list of goal related skills based on the title of the high-level goal, in order to capture necessary skills to master for the given learning goal. For these recommendations, we rely on the ESCO 2 data-set, which is a European multilingual classification system of skills, competences and occupations. ESCO is continuously updated by subject matter experts of the European Commission and includes 13,485 skills, linked to 2942 occupations. We match the title of the high-level goal with existing occupations in ESCO using the Bleu score [11] concept. We decided to use Bleu score as it allows us to capture the closest term (occupation in this case) in the ESCO data-set no matter in what language the title is. Finally, we recommend a list of skills linked to the closest occupation to the author. Authors can either select skills from the list, or add new skills manually. After finalizing the skill list, the author can sort skills based on the order they need to be shown to learners. Figure 1 shows an screenshot about adding a high-level goal to our system.

As for these resources we do not have any topic labels, we use an LDA model, an unsupervised machine learning method, which considers each transcript as a distribution of different topics, each topic as a distribution of different words, and aims to extract existing topics together with their distribution of words. To find the number of learning topics related to a skill, which is the input of the LDA model (as parameter ), we calculate Coherence [15] for different number of topics (between 2 to 50), and set with the topic amount that results in the highest coherence value. Again, for each newly extracted topic, we extract the ten most important words (and their probabilities) and add them to the previous words in our recommendation list.
