            "text": "Lujo virus (LUJV) belongs to the Old World (OW) genus Mammarenavirus (family Arenaviridae). It is categorized as a biosafety level (BSL) 4 agent. Currently, there are no U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drugs or vaccines specifically for LUJV or other pathogenic OW mammarenaviruses. Here, a high-throughput screening of an FDA-approved drug library was conducted using pseudotype viruses bearing LUJV envelope glycoprotein (GPC) to identify inhibitors of LUJV entry. Three hit compounds, trametinib, manidipine, and lercanidipine, were identified as LUJV entry inhibitors in the micromolar range. Mechanistic studies revealed that trametinib inhibited LUJV GPC-mediated membrane fusion by targeting C410 [located in the transmembrane (TM) domain], while manidipine and lercanidipine inhibited LUJV entry by acting as calcium channel blockers. Meanwhile, all three hits extended their antiviral spectra to the entry of other pathogenic mammarenaviruses. Furthermore, all three could inhibit the authentic prototype mammarenavirus, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), and could prevent infection at the micromolar level. This study shows that trametinib, manidipine, and lercanidipine are candidates for LUJV therapy and highlights the critical role of calcium in LUJV infection. The presented findings reinforce the notion that the key residue(s) located in the TM domain of GPC provide an entry-targeted platform for designing mammarenavirus inhibitors.",

            "text": "Lujo virus (LUJV) was identified in Zambia and South Africa in 2008. It is the pathogen of Lujo hemorrhagic fever (LUHF; Briese et al., 2009) . LUJV is an enveloped, negative-sense, bi-segmented RNA virus belonging to the genus Mammarenavirus (family Arenaviridae; Oldstone, 2002; Briese et al., 2009) . The mammarenavirus RNA genome encodes viral polymerase, nucleoproteins, matrix protein (Z), and glycoprotein complex (GPC). GPC is synthesized as a polypeptide precursor that is sequentially cleaved by signal peptidase and the cellular protease subtilisin kexin isozyme-1/site-1 protease to generate the three subunits of the mature complex: the retained stable signal peptide (SSP), the receptor-binding subunit GP1, and the membrane fusion subunit GP2 (Lenz et al., 2001; Eichler et al., 2003; Igonet et al., 2011; Wang et al., 2016) . These three non-covalently bound subunits form a (SSP/GP1/GP2)3 trimeric complex that is present at the surface of the mature virion. It plays an essential role in virus entry. The relatively conserved mammarenavirus SSP and GP2 form an interface that not only contributes to the stabilization of the prefusion conformation of GPC, but also provides an \"Achilles' heel\" that can be targeted by the entry inhibitors.",

Based on phylogenetic analysis, LUJV has been demonstrated to be distinct from OW and NW mammarenaviruses and has been reported to use neuropilin-2 (NRP2) as its primary receptor, rather than the typical receptors utilized by OW (\u03b1-dystroglycan) and NW (transferrin receptor) mammarenaviruses (Raaben et al., 2017; Cohen-Dvashi et al., 2018) . LUJV, the OW Lassa virus (LASV); and some NW mammarenaviruses, including the Jun\u00edn virus (JUNV), Machupo virus (MACV), Guanarito virus (GTOV), Chapare virus (CHAPV), and Sabi\u00e1 virus (SBAV), are known to cause severe hemorrhagic fever. They are listed as biosafety level (BSL) 4 agents (Buchmeier et al., 2007; Vela, 2012) .",

To address this issue, here we screened a U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drug library of 1,775 compounds. Drug repurposing is a strategy that is used to accelerate the discovery and development of new and emerging pathogens. Meanwhile, understanding the antiviral mechanisms of potential drugs that could combat LUJV could provide novel insights into its pathogenesis. The safety, pharmacokinetics, and mechanisms of approved drugs have been intensively investigated. Here, therefore, we screened drugs that targeted the entry step of LUJV infection, as this could block viral replication and spreading at an early stage. After three rounds of screening, trametinib [mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) inhibitor used for the treatment of melanoma], manidipine, and lercanidipine (calcium channel antagonists used for the treatment of hypertension), were found to be highly effective against LJUV entry, offering potential new therapies to treat LUHF.",

LUJVrv possesses the entry characteristics of LUJV and can be handled under BSL-2 conditions (Garbutt et al., 2004; Wang et al., 2018) . The HTS assay conditions, including the seeding cell density and LUJVrv infective dose, were optimized at 1.5 \u00d7 10 4 cells and 1.5 \u00d7 10 2 PFU per 96-well plate, respectively. Under these optimized conditions, the coefficient of variation (CV) and Z' factor were 4.21 and 0.95%, respectively, demonstrating that this assay represents a promising approach for the large-scale screening of inhibitors. A schematic of the HTS is shown in Figure 1A . Inhibitors were defined as prime candidates with >90% inhibition and no apparent cytotoxicity at a concentration of 10 \u03bcM. Of the 1,775 tested compounds, 145 (8.17%) were considered as prime candidates. Then, the prime candidates were subjected to counterscreening to rule out the inhibition of VSV genome replication. Twenty-one compounds (1.18%) were selected with inhibition of VSV < 10% at 25 \u03bcM. Screening was then performed to reconfirm the results using these compounds over a broader concentration range (0.024-75.0 \u03bcM). Four compounds (0.23%) were selected based on their concentration-dependent inhibitory effects. Among these four compounds, the top three hits (trametinib, manidipine, and lercanidipine) were selected for further investigation, and ospemifene was eliminated because of its cytotoxicity ( Figure 1B) .",

One possible reason for this might be that one additional plasmid, (CD63 GY234AA ) needed to be co-transfected with other plasmids (Wang et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2019; Cao et al., 2021; Liu et al., 2021) , which led to a low transfection efficacy.

            "text": "As most arenavirus entry inhibitors target the SSP-GP2 interface to prevent membrane fusion, we further investigated the viral targets of the hit compounds. We selected the adaptive mutant virus by serially passaging the replication-competed with LUJVrv, in the presence of the hit compounds. The starting concentration was 10 \u03bcM for trametinib and manidipine and 20 \u03bcM for lercanidipine, corresponding to the IC 90 values obtained in the LUJVrv inhibition assay ( Figure 1C) . Parallel passaging of LUJVrv was also conducted in DMSO as a control. In the trametinib-treated group, resistance was detected after three rounds of passaging, which increased in passage P4 and then remained stable through passages P5-P6 ( Figure 3A) . To identify the viral genetic determinant(s) responsible for the resistance, we sequenced the trametinib-resistant virus and identified the cysteine (C)-to-glycine (G) mutation at amino acid position 410, which is located at the C terminus of the transmembrane domain (TM) on GP2 (Figure 3B ). To confirm that the C410G mutation conferred trametinib resistance, we introduced a mutation into the GPC gene and generated a pseudotype mutant virus. Compared with the wild-type (WT) LUJVpv, the C410G mutant virus exhibited robust resistance to trametinib, but remained sensitive to manidipine and lercanidipine ( Figure 3C) . Resistance was confirmed in the membrane fusion assay by the obvious formation of syncytium in the GPC C410G group, when treated with trametinib. Meanwhile, syncytium formation was robustly inhibited in WT ( Figure 3D) . The cysteine residues located within the border region between the transmembrane domain and the cytoplasmic tail of glycoprotein were usually found to be palmitoylated (Veit, 2012) . Furthermore, LUJV GPC possessed the motif C 410 IC, which was reported to be palmitoylated in Ebola virus (EBOV) and Marburg virus (MARV) glycoprotein (Ito et al., 2001) . Thus, we hypothesize that both C410 and C412 might serve as potential palmitoylated sites in LUJV GPC and that palmitic acid might be the target of trametinib. To this end, C412 was substituted with G, and its drug sensitivity/resistance was evaluated. As shown in Figure 4A , both the single C412G mutant and the combined C410G/C412G mutant still underwent membrane fusion with acid triggering, similar to that of C410G ( Figure 3D ). When treated with trametinib, fusogenicity was inhibited in the C412G group, but not in the C410G/C412G group, suggesting that only C410 served as the viral target of trametinib. Furthermore, LUJV C412G pv was still as sensitive to trametinib as that of WT, whereas LUJV C410G/C412G pv was resistant to trametinib, similar to LUJV C410G pv ( Figure 4B ). This confirms that only C410G contributed to the resistance to trametinib.",

Furthermore, the siRNA knockdown of CACNA1S effectively blocked infection by MACVpv, but not by VSVpv.

It has been shown to inhibit severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by downregulating the expression of ACE2 (Zhou et al., 2020) . Intriguingly, investigating the antiviral mechanism of trametinib revealed that it could robustly block LUJV GPC-mediated membrane fusion and its viral target was C410, which was embedded in the TM domain of GP2. In mammarenavirus GPC, the retained SSP interacts with the membrane-proximal external region, as well as the TM domain of GP2. Thus, it stabilizes the prefusion conformation of GPC and provides an \"Achilles' heel\" that can be targeted by distinct entry inhibitors (Larson et al., 2008; Lee et al., 2008; Shankar et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2019; Tang et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2021) . To our knowledge, this is the first study to report entry inhibitors targeting the LUJV SSP-GP2 interface and to identify their viral target(s). Notably, trametinib extended its antiviral spectrum to the pseudotypes of other pathogenic mammarenavirus infections. We demonstrated that trametinib inhibited LASVpv infection by targeting F446 (embedded in the SSP-GP2 interface). Trametinib inhibited both the pseudotype and authentic LCMV infection with similar IC 50 values. For NW mammarenaviruses, we hypothesize that inhibition might occur due to a reduction in the surface expression of the NW mammarenavirus receptor TfR1 (Horniblow et al., 2017) .",

Notably, VGCC has been reported to play essential roles in NW mammarenavirus infection (Lavanya et al., 2013; Sarute and Ross, 2020) . This is in line with our results, which showed that both manidipine and lercanidipine robustly inhibited NW mammarenavirus entry, with IC 50 values ranging from 0.1-1 \u03bcM. Lacidipine, which is a VGCC inhibitor, has been demonstrated to inhibit LASVpv and GTOVpv infections, as well as GPC-mediated membrane fusion, by targeting LASV T40 (in the ectodomain of SSP), GTOV V36 (in the ectodomain of SSP), and V436 (in TM domain of GP2; Wang et al., 2018) . To investigate whether manidipine and lercanidipine inhibit LUJV entry by acting as calcium inhibitors or fusion inhibitors, we studied the effects of both drugs on LUJV GPC-mediated membrane fusion and neither showed promising inhibition of fusion. We tried to select the adaptive mutant by serially passaging with increasing concentrations of both drugs (10-50 \u03bcM), but no mutant was observed in GPC. Notably, after reviewing all 29 calcium inhibitors included in the current FDA drug library, we found that besides manidipine and lercanidipine, 12 additional calcium channel blockers (10 \u03bcM) inhibited LUJVrv infection to >90% inhibition, suggesting that calcium channels are potential antiviral targets. By using siRNA to knockdown VGCC genes, we found VGCC to be essential for LUJV entry. Based on these results, the calcium channel might serve as a potential antiviral target in LUJV treatment. Manidipine and lercanidipine inhibited LUJVpv entry by acting as calcium inhibitors.",

Similar to our results, these SERMs showed cytotoxicity, with relatively low CC 50 values (5-10 \u03bcM; Welch et al., 2021) . Although their associated cytotoxicity limits the use of SERMs in antiviral treatment, their promising inhibitory effects suggest that their action mechanisms, that is, the activation or repression of the estrogen target genes (Riggs and Hartmann, 2003) , might be involved in LUJV infection. Furthermore, the core structures of SERMs might serve as a backbone for structure-activity relationship optimization for drug development.",
