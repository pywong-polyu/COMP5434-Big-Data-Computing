            "text": "Emerging zoonotic diseases pose a serious threat not only to animal populations, but also to humans around the globe, as we experience with SARS-CoV-2 and the current COVID-19 pandemic [1] . A recent example of an emerging zoonotic pathogen in the family Coronaviridae is the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). It was first isolated in June 2012 from the sputum of a 60-year-old man from Saudi Arabia with acute pneumonia [2] . However, the April 2012 outbreak of acute respiratory illness in Jordan was retrospectively also diagnosed as MERS-CoV epidemic [3] . Similar to other emerging human coronaviruses, MERS-CoV is thought to have originated from bats; however, dromedaries (Camelus dromedarius) have been identified as reservoir hosts and the collected in the field from three different sites in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). All dromedaries were assessed for MERS-CoV antibodies accounting for (past) infection by Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) and Indirect Immunofluorescence Test (IIFT), as well as for the presence of the active virus (shedding) via molecular detection of viral nucleic acid using reverse transcription quantitative (RT-q) PCR. Most of the 121 dromedaries harbored MERS-CoV antibodies, which revealed that even young animals from the age of 2 months had already been exposed to the virus. Thus, we split all individuals positive for antibodies (seropositive) into two groups based on (i) virus presence (infection at the time of testing) and (ii) virus absence (no detectable infection at the time of testing). We also recorded the clinical status of the sampled dromedaries, however, due to the nonspecific signs of MERS-CoV, i.e., mild naso-ocular discharge, the clinical observations of the individuals were not convincing. As we are aware of the limitations related to a study conducted in the field (versus a controlled experiment), we accounted for (i) population structure, (ii) equal possibility of exposure to virus infection, and (iii) age and sex to reduce potential biases. Using phenotype-genotype association tests with univariate logistic regression, we identified candidate genes, which might be related to MERS-CoV infection in dromedaries. Although some of the gene variants associated to the presence of the disease have previously been related to SARS-CoV-1/-2 and other respiratory infectious diseases, further genomic and functional analyses will be necessary to broaden and corroborate our results. With our work, within all its limitations, we open doors for future novel research including large-scale screening for genes underlying defense mechanisms against an important zoonotic disease.",

As backup, we also collected tail hair samples, which were stored in labeled paper envelopes. All dromedaries (aged \u2265 6 months) in the UAE have a subcutaneous identity microchip that is linked to a national database containing information on the camel's age, sex, and geographic origin within the UAE. All camels were scanned for these microchips and demographic data were extracted from the national database.",

For each 120-bp bait candidate, one BLAST hit against CamDro3 with the highest melting temperature was first discarded from the results (allowing for 1 hit in the genome), and only the top 500 hits (by bit score) were considered. Based on the distribution of remaining calculated melting temperatures, Daicel Arbor Biosciences filtered out nonspecific baits using the \"Relaxed\" (more nonspecific baits pass) criteria. Additional candidates were retained if they had at most 10 hits between 62.5 and 65 \u2022 C and 4 hits above 65 \u2022 C, and fewer than 2 passing baits on each flank.",

Almost half of the dromedaries (n = 37, 48.7%) were both RNA-and IgG-positive, which shows animals were infected and were likely shedding virus due to new (re)infection or persistent infection, possibly with continuous or intermittent shedding. Three MERS-CoV RNA-positive dromedaries were negative by both serological assays indicating recent virus infection of these animals. Three further RNA-positive animals were ELISA negative (or borderline positive) but IIFT positive. Nasal swabs from dromedaries from the two other sites (wildlife reserve and camel farm), as well as all serum samples tested negative by the MERS-CoV specific RT-qPCR (Table S1 ).",

Of the unique reads, 97.53% were successfully aligned to the most up-to-date dromedary (CamDro3) reference genome [23] (mean \u00b1 standard deviation aligned reads per sample = 5,511,298 \u00b1 1,534,987; minimum-maximum: 209,624-9,621,299). Mean coverage in the target region was generally high for each sample (186\u00d7 \u00b1 60\u00d7; minimum-maximum: 6\u00d7-320\u00d7), resulting in the identification of 5768 raw SNPs in the target region. After variant filtering, filtering for genotype missingness (<25%) and removing non-polymorphic loci, we identified 760 SNPs. Due to the low number of SNPs in the target region after filtering we performed read-based imputation, which has successfully been used by animal and plant breeders [52] . Imputation enabled extending the set of SNPs identified to 5730 SNPs, however, upon filtering these markers with INFO_SCORE \u2265 0.3 and removing non-polymorphic loci 3958 SNPs remained for further analyses.",

However, due to an equivocal annotation of this locus in the CamDro3 reference genome, it is not clear whether it is a complete, potentially functional MHC class I sequence, and Mago Homolog B (MAGOHB), which harbored four intronic variants. The other SNPs were found in introns of the genes Dynein Axonemal Heavy Chain 7 (DNAH7; chr 17), Interleukin 10 Receptor Subunit Alpha (IL10RA; chr 33) and Coiled-Coil and C2 Domain Containing 2A (CC2D2A; chr 2). Among the potentially associated variants with slightly higher p-values (\u22640.01548), we identified nine SNPs (seven in introns, one in exon 2 and another one in exon 4) located in the MHC class II gene HLA-DPB1-like (Table 2) , which we thus consider as a strong candidate as well.",

In this largest national livestock market, dromedaries from all over the UAE are sold, and this cohort was less structured in terms of their exposure to infection. The other two sampling locations included a wildlife reserve where the camels do not have regular contact with other dromedaries and a Bedouin owned camel farm, where the animals are relatively isolated. As such, we repeated the univariate logistic regression analysis only including 60 samples from the livestock market (35 females, 24 males, 1 unknown), split into 36 cases (MERS-CoV positive) and 24 controls (MERS-CoV negative), and genotyped for 2917 SNPs (after filtering for HWE and MAF as before). As the dromedaries had been transported to the livestock market from all over the UAE, we corrected for potential population structure and included the first five most informative PCs (33% of the variation; Figure S1a ) as a covariate in the univariate logistic regression analysis, along with sex and age. The genomic inflation estimation lambda (\u03bb) was 0.78, and the QQ plot with PCA correction showed that observed values followed expected ones, with an end tail as observed in GWAS studies ( Figure S2b ).

Additionally, another 94 dromedaries were screened as part of a public health surveillance and all showed seropositivity (N. Nowotny, personal communication). While sex was equally distributed over seropositive individuals in our study, age was as young as 2 months with an average of 6 years (Table S1 ). Previous studies have shown that seropositivity is higher among adult dromedaries (2 years and older), indicating that the likelihood of exposure and subsequent infection increases with age [54] . Camels generally shed MERS-CoV for about 7 days and viral RNA is detectable with RT-qPCR up to 35 days post-infection. Virus-specific antibodies can be identified from 3 weeks after infection onwards, with anti-MERS-CoV IgMs present for at least 4 weeks (indicating a more recent infection), while anti-MERS-CoV IgGs can stay for many years [55] . High seroprevalence coupled with known instances of camel-human transmission provides a proxy for prospective epidemiological risks [56] , as a human case study in Saudi Arabia with higher-than-expected prevalence of MERS-CoV seropositivity in dromedaries demonstrated [57] . Naturally infected dromedary camels shed virus from the upper respiratory tract, evidenced by the presence of RNA in the RT-qPCR from the nasal swabs we collected. No current MERS-CoV positives were detected among the Bedouin family-owned dromedaries or the wildlife reserve (Table S1 ), compared to the livestock market where animals from different regions in the UAE are mixed in medium-sized (~50-100 sqm) pens.",

Both candidate gene and genome-wide sequencing approaches have offered relevant insights into the genetic basis of these zoonotic diseases [58] . Unlike for SARS-CoV-1 and -2, few studies have been conducted on host genetic variation underlying susceptibility to MERS-CoV, its pathogenesis, transmission, and mortality in humans [59, 60] . In this field study, we identified candidate genes on four different chromosomes potentially associated to MERS-CoV infection in dromedaries from the UAE, PTPN4, DNAH7, MHC class-I (HLA-A-24like sequence), MHC class II (HLA-DPB1-like) and MAGOHB. The SNPs significantly associated with the presence of MERS-CoV in seropositive camels were mainly distributed in intronic regions (Table 2 ) except for the MHC class II gene HLA-DPB1-like, where we found one SNP in exon 2 and another in exon 4 ( Table 2 ). Exon 2 encodes the antigenbinding groove of the class II molecule and, therefore, its polymorphism is of functional importance. Exon 4 codes for the transmembrane domain that controls membrane domain partitioning and class II structure, both of which influence antigen presentation and T-cell activation [61] . In recent years, an important role of intronic polymorphisms has been established, either filling regulatory functions upstream of exons or being in linkage with other (exonic) variants (e.g., [62] ). The HLA-A-24-like sequence harboring the significant chr20:23100696 and further variants (Table 2 and Figure S2 ) is incompletely annotated as fully functional classical MHC class I gene, with no exon 2 sequence, in the dromedary reference genome (CamDro3) as well as in the next closely related and chromosomeassembled genome of the wild camel (Camelus ferus; [16] ). Therefore, we cannot exclude the possibility that we sequenced a pseudogene or a misassembled chimeric sequence for this locus. Although the (functional) impact of the identified candidate genes on MERS-CoV infection in dromedaries has yet to be determined, previous research associated those genes with viral replication in SARS-CoV-1/-2, MERS-CoV and other viruses causing respiratory infectious diseases in humans, and with pathways involved in the movement of bronchial cilia.",

For instance, it inhibits the Toll-like receptor (TLR) 4 signaling pathway that triggers many immune proteins including proinflammatory cytokines and type I interferons [63] . Interestingly, while PTPN4 acts as an inhibitor, the TLR4 signaling pathway is activated by the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein [64] , and mice lacking TLR4 had more severe SARS-CoV infections than wild-type mice [65] . Meanwhile, the spike protein of MERS-CoV triggers the expression of negative regulators of the TLR signaling pathways [65] . Understanding the TLR signaling pathways in the context of MERS-CoV infection also in dromedaries would be an important contribution to mitigate the viral infection. PTPN4 is related to predicted target functions of human micro(mi)RNAs that bind to the single-stranded (ss)-RNA such as SARS-CoV-2, and possibly to its spike protein gene. These predicted miRNA targets might destabilize the ss-RNA translation of SARS-CoV-2 in respiratory epithelial cells, which could explain successful antiviral defense [66] . As both polymorphisms identified in the UAE dromedaries are located in intronic regions (introns 25 and 26) of PTPN4, they might have regulatory functions that can influence the expression of the gene [62] .",

            "text": "HLA-A-24-like (MHC class I A-24). The MHC (classes I, II, and III) has a dense clustering of immune relevant genes that can show extreme polymorphisms due to their main task of encoding cell surface proteins involved in antigen presentation [71] . Thus, HLA polymorphisms have been linked to susceptibility and pathogenesis of numerous infectious diseases including those caused by RNA viruses, especially SARS, influenza, AIDS, rabies, and West Nile fever [59] . For example, a protective effect of HLA-A*02:01 against SARS-CoV-1 has been suggested in Asian patients [72, 73] , while HLA-A*24:02 has been associated with COVID-19 susceptibility [74] . Large meta-analyses of allele frequency distributions in human traits showed that SNPs connected to disease susceptibility are generally skewed towards a higher minor allele frequency (>20%) [75] . In our study, a significantly higher (25%; p = 0.0028) frequency was also observed for the minor allele of the HLA-A-24-like chr20:23100696 in MERS-CoV positive dromedaries (Table 2) . However, as this result concerns only a single SNP within a sequence of unclear status, several different interpretations are possible, including a false positive statistical artifact, an isolated finding due to an inaccurate annotation and assembly of the sequence and/or an effect of linkage with a causative MHC SNP variant. Therefore, our observation that UAE dromedaries with higher MAF within the HLA-A-24-like sequence might be more susceptible to MERS-CoV infection needs to be corroborated by additional (long-read) sequencing and haplotype analysis, including samples from other Arabian and African populations.",

Although antigen presentation of SARS-CoV-1 mainly depends on MHC class I molecules [76] , class II genes can also contribute to Betacoronaviridae antigen presentation as suggested by the association of HLA-DRB1*11:01 and HLA-DQB1*02:02 alleles with susceptibility to MERS-CoV [60] . In COVID-19 patients from Italy, the allele frequency distributions for HLA-DRB1*15:01 and DQB1*06:02 showed significant correlations of the minor allele with higher susceptibility to the disease, while DRB1*07:01 on the contrary was negatively associated [77] . Interestingly, dromedaries with no current MERS-CoV infection were more often homozygote for the minor allele of HLA-DPB1-like, which is a paralog of HLA-DRB1 in humans. The associations observed may, however, result from the effect of linkage with other MHC sequences.",

            "text": "MAGOHB. MAGOHB belongs to the mago nashi gene family and is required for pre-mRNA splicing. In macrophages-one of the effector cells of the innate immune system-the expression of MAGOHB increased rapidly after lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation [78] . LPS is a natural adjuvant, which is synthesized by Gram-negative bacteria, and stimulates cells through TLR4 signaling pathway, causing the release of inflammatory cytokines and the upregulation of costimulatory molecules on antigen presenting cells [79] . Interestingly, MAGOHB is targeted by has-miR-20a-5p, one of six miRNAs that previously have been reported to be antiviral in respiratory diseases, and were found to be downregulated in lung tissues during viral infection [80, 81] . From a network analysis, has-miR-20a-5p was identified among 38 miRNAs targeting host genes that interact with SARS-CoV-2 proteins [82] . The homozygote alternative (minor) genotype of MAGOHB was significantly (p < 0.005) more frequent in our control group, which might hint to a higher resistance to MERS-CoV infection in these dromedaries. It is also possible that MAGOHB represents positional markers in linkage with some genes of the natural killer complex (NKC). The dromedary NKC harbors, besides tested KLR genes, a number of other C-type lectin-like (CLEC) receptor genes downstream of MAGOHB [31] that were not included in the hybridization capture of IR genes. CLECs are expressed by myeloid cells and serve to monitor their environment and sense danger. In principle, they recognize a vast repertoire of (non-)glycan ligands from pathogens or modulate activity of cells. Dendritic cell CLECs, for example, by recognition and internalization of ligands start the process of antigen presentation to T cells and generation of an immune response [83] .",

            "text": "Biological interpretations of statistical significance in association (field) studies have several limitations. While we did our best to select an equal distribution of age and sex and to account for potential population structure in the dromedaries sampled from three locations in the UAE, we cannot exclude that some of the associations presented here are false positives. Due to the nature of a field study, we cannot guarantee that all individuals had equally been exposed to MERS-CoV, although we included only dromedaries with antibodies indicating that they have had contact with the virus at some time in the past. We attempted to control for this fact by repeating the univariate logistic genotype-phenotype regression analysis only with dromedaries from the largest livestock market located in the emirate of Abu Dhabi, where animals from all over the UAE are traded. Our different tests accounting for spatial and temporal sampling showed in general good coherence of the results in the top selected candidate genes. The genetic power calculation for the required sample size to detect \"true\" association with a power of 80% in a candidate gene with significant allele frequency differences between case and controls resulted in a minimum number of 15 samples, which was reached throughout all subsampling strategies (e.g., 22 cases in the spring season samples, Figure S1b ). While the analyzed virus assessment reflects presence/absence of the virus in seropositive camels, the nonrandom distribution of SNPs observed between actively infected/noninfected individuals indicates that they are genetically different, which consequently demands further investigations especially in terms of their immune mechanisms. Future case-case control studies need to include more dromedary populations from different African and Arabian countries and, though challenging, potential birth cohort studies or experimental MERS-CoV inoculation of dromedaries and other livestock herded together. This would help define predisposed groups and support screening efforts for potential virus reservoirs. The next important step will be to investigate expression and functional pathways of the identified candidate IR genes to select for higher resistance to MERS-CoV. Finally, the innate and adaptive IR genes identified in dromedaries show high resemblances with human immune response to the zoonotic SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV. Thus, understanding the underlying mechanisms to disease susceptibility/resistance in dromedaries and other animals will result in more effective strategies to combat betacoronaviral disease in human populations as well.
