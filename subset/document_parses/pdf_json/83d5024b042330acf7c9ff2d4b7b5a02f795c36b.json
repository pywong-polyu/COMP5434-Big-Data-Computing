This provides an early diagnosis, based on which prompt treatment with the appropriate antihelminthics can be started, thereby reducing the probability of disseminated infection. Disseminated strongyloidiasis is a medical emergency with a poor prognosis, especially in an immunocompromised state. Such patients should be treated aggressively with antihelminthics. They must be monitored for sufficient duration in the hospital for early signs of complication. Their discharge from hospital should be planned based on a negative stool microscopy report in addition to clinical improvement, so as to decrease the mortality reported for both untreated and treated individuals.",

Stool microscopy was repeated with freshly collected stool samples on three separate occasions, which also demonstrated motile rhabditiform larvae of S. stercoralis (Fig. 2 ). In addition, agar culture method was performed to visualize the positive trail sign. Nearly 2 g of freshly passed stool was placed on an agar plate. The plate was sealed with tape and then incubated at room temperature for 2 days. The plate was later examined and showed a 'positive trail sign' , that is, there were tracks present as the bacteria were carried over the agar by the migrating larvae.

Humans and dogs are two major hosts for this parasite [11] and it has been identified in humans and domestic dogs in the same rural community in north-east Thailand and in other countries [12] .

A mild to moderate eosinophilia should require ruling out associated tissue helminthic infections. Strongyloides infection is one of the common causes, in addition to trichinella, ascaris, hookworm and visceral larva migrans. However, this patient had a normal peripheral blood eosinophil count. It is reported that at least 25 % of patients infected with Strongyloides may not have eosinophilia [13] and that absence of eosinophilia may be associated with a poor prognosis [14] . Loss of weight and appetite, as was seen in our patient, may have been associated with chronic immunosuppression [15] . Fatal hypokalaemia has been reported due to S. stercoralis infestation [16] , but in this case the hypokalaemia was corrected and could not have contributed to the fatality.",

There is a close association of the Aeromonas species with aquatic ecosystems. A similar situation of coinfection with Aeromonas species has been reported in a 75-year-old man in Puerto Rico with multiple myeloma [17] . The most common presentation for Aeromonas gastroenteritis is a secretory (watery) enteritis, and this may have contributed to or exacerbated the enteric manifestation in this patient [18] . The occurrence of E. coli sepsis, which the patient succumbed to, is similar to a previous case report in which the patient succumbed to E. coli sepsis after 14 days of hospitalization [19] . The passage of enteric flora (E. coli) through disrupted mucosa leading to the bacteraemia suggests disseminated strongyloidiasis [20, 21] . Hence, in this patient the bacteraemia caused by E. coli and the USG and CT abdomen findings of lesions involving the liver are strongly suggestive of disseminated strongyloidiasis infection along with translocation of gut bacteria.",
