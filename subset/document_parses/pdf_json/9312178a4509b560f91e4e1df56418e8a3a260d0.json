This longitudinal observational study aimed to investigate the effects of mood states and exercise on nutritional choices, on 176 college students (92 males, 84 females; 23 \u00b1 4 years old) during the COVID-19 lockdown. During 21 days, nutrition and exercise were daily monitored, and the mood states assessed. A factor analysis was used to reduce the number of nutritional variables collected. The relationships between exercise, mood and nutrition were investigated using a multivariate general linear model and a mediation model. Seven factors were found, reflecting different nutritional choices. Exercise was positively associated with fruit, vegetables and fish consumption (p = 0.004). Depression and quality of life were, directly and inversely, associated with cereals, legumes (p = 0.005; p = 0.004) and low-fat meat intake (p = 0.040; p = 0.004). Exercise mediated the effect of mood states on fruit, vegetables and fish consumption, respectively, accounting for 4.2% and 1.8% of the total variance. Poorer mood states possibly led to unhealthy dietary habits, which can themselves be linked to negative mood levels. Exercise led to healthier nutritional choices, and mediating the effects of mood states, it might represent a key measure in uncommon situations, such as home-confinement.",

Mood disturbances, such as anxiety, depression, anger and irritability, have been previously reported in several studies during quarantine periods, as reviewed by Brooks et al. [10] . Ammar et al. [1] conducted an online survey during the Antunes et al. [7] conducted a survey on a sample of Portuguese adults during the epidemic, reporting altered eating habits, with increased quantity and frequency of meals; contrasting results are presented regarding the attention to the food selection. Di Renzo et al. [28] investigated the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on eating habits and lifestyle changes among the Italian population aged \u226512 years, reporting a higher adherence to the Mediterranean diet in the group aged 18-30 years, compared to the younger and the elderly population. Gallo et al. [8] investigated the impact of isolation measures on energy intake and physical activity levels in Australian university students, reporting a reduction in physical exercise levels, and an increase in energy intake and snacking frequency. Interestingly, Romero-Blanco et al. [29] reported that-during home-confinement in Spain-university students that adopted a Mediterranean diet, also spent more time doing physical exercise. Ingram et al. [30] investigated the changes in health behaviours related to negative mood states in a sample of about four hundred adults during the COVID-19 quarantine in the UK, reporting changes in diet, sleep quality, physical activity levels and poorer mental health. Most of the studies above reported had cross-sectional designs, performed through questionnaires or online surveys. It was previously identified that surveys and self-reported food diaries with a short time of data collection are likely to underreporting from participants; however, the 24 h recall for multiple days significantly reduces this effect [22] .",

From the list of macro-and micronutrients obtained from the Metadieta software, given the high number of variables collected, it was appropriate to reduce their number, minimising the loss of information. So, a Principal Axis Factor with a Varimax (orthogonal) rotation of 27 nutritional variables above considered was conducted on data gathered from participants. Kaiser-Meyer Olkin (KMO) measure of sampling adequacy was also performed; the minimum acceptable value for KMO is 0.6, although the ideal is over 0.70.

Pillai's trace statistic was used; Pillai's trace is more robust to departures from assumptions than Wilk's lambda, Hotelling's trace, and Roy's largest root. Subsequent univariate ANOVAs were also performed for each dependent variable (factors) considered. Finally, in order to assess if exercise could mediate the effect of psychological states on nutrition, a mediation effect has been calculated. A mediated effect is also called 'indirect effect', and it occurs when the effect of the independent variables (psychometric scales) on the dependent variable (factors' scores obtained by factor analysis) is-as the name says-mediated by another variable: a mediator (training load). Mandatory condition to establish any mediation effect is that the independent variable (IV) must have a significant effect on the mediator. In mediation analysis, we considered as independent variables the same variables reported in GLM analysis. In mediation analysis, the following estimations are reported:",

Table 1 presents the rotated component matrix, eigenvalues, and the percentage of variance explained; note that the seven components explain 77.1% of the variance. Seven variables loaded in Factor 1, accounting for 32.0% of the variance; a high intake of carbohydrates characterised it with elevated glycaemic load (including both glucides and starch), plant-based protein and fibre. This factor may be mainly due to cereals, and secondly to legumes consumption. Six variables loaded in Factor 2, accounting for 14.6% of the variance; these were related to vegetable-fats consumption (monounsaturated, polyunsaturated, and saturated fats), vitamin E and Omega-6. This factor might be interpreted as dried fruits and vegetable oils intake, as olive oil. Nine variables loaded in Factor 3, accounting for 9.3% of the variance; it was characterised by a high intake of animal-based protein and lipids, with high protein value, saturated and monounsaturated fats, Omega-6, vitamin B6 and Tyrosine, but showed a negative load for glucides consumption.

Four variables loaded in Factor 5, accounting for 5.0% of the variance; it was characterised by a significant amino acid intake (tryptophan, phenylalanine, tyrosine) and animal-based proteins. Given that this factor is not affected by fats, it could be hypothesised that lean (low-fat) meats represent it. Five variables loaded in Factor 6, accounting for 4.6% of the variance; with a high intake of Omega-3, vitamin B12, vitamin D, animal-based proteins, and polyunsaturated fats, this factor could be easily interpreted as fish consumption.

This is in accordance with the results obtained by Donati Zeppa et al. [22] , which showed that nine weeks of high-intensity interval training promoted a spontaneous modulation of healthy food choices and regulation of dietary intake in young normal-weight college students, aged 21-24. Jayawardene et al. [47] also highlighted that exercise could favour fruit and vegetable consumption in young adulthood. Romero-Blanco et al. [29] conducted a study among university students during home-confinement due to COVID-19 in Spain, and evidenced a positive correlation between a Mediterranean diet (known to be rich in fruit and vegetables) and physical exercise. Physical exercise and healthy food choices seem to facilitate each other, via improved self-regulatory strategies and intentions (e.g., planning to perform physical exercise), indicating potential transfer effects between these behaviours [19, 47, 48] . Although exercise has been observed to mainly influence fruit and vegetable consumption [27] , it could be argued that the above-mentioned transfer effects may also influence other nutritional choices, such as increasing fish intake or limiting meats or milk-derivatives, known to be rich in saturated fats.",

The results of PHQ-9 scores are coherent with those reported for SF-12 (i.e., better quality of life), where higher scores were associated with lower consumption of Factor 1 and 5. There is a known link between mood and carbohydrates, with many people eating palatable high carbohydrate/high-fat foods when in a poor mood [55] . Indeed, carbohydrate-rich foods could be a way of self-medicating depression [56] , and the effect of carbohydrate cravings may be even stronger when people eat food with a high glycaemic index. A carbohydrate-rich meal tends to raise serotonin levels, which imbalance contributes to the development of depressive symptoms [57] . Therefore, it would make sense that people with more severe depressive symptoms (likely associated with a lower perceived life quality) tend to have a diet rich in carbohydrates. Conversely, there is some, although controversial, evidence that eating fish might reduce the risk of depression [58, 59] . In general, the more enriched in fruits and vegetables and poorer in fat and in red meat a diet is, the lower the chance of showing symptoms of depression [58] . However, people perceiving their quality of life as already good were less likely to consume foods popularly considered \"healthy\" since, in all likelihood, they did not feel the need of correcting with the diet their health or psychological status.",

This could be explained by the model proposed by Christensen L. [60] : it has been proposed that there is a reciprocal interactive relationship between carbohydrate cravings and mood. Emotional distress causes a preference and craving for carbohydrate-rich foods, and these may have a positive reinforcing effect on mood, explaining the higher PANAS positive score. However, legumes consumption has been previously related to lower stress levels and better positive affects [61] . Finally, although negative affect (PANAS negative scores) have been associated with a reduction in Factor 3 (i.e., high-fat meat and milk-derivatives) and an increase in Factor 6 (i.e., fish), research relating meat consumption with mood and life quality is inconclusive, with contrasting results; so, more research is needed to investigate these relationships [61] . However, it might be suggested that this effect depends on a subgroup of people with modest depression preferring a diet with fish and less high-fat meat and milk-derivatives as a strategy to deal with their symptoms.",

            "text": "The indirect effects of exercise on mood scales (PHQ-9, PANAS positive and negative, SF-12) and nutritional choices (factors) were studied using a mediation model. Although some other studies reported that changes in diet and physical exercise had a clear link to negative mood states [30] , to the authors' knowledge only a few studies used a mediation approach to investigate this relationship [25, 27] . Results supported that exercise partially mediated the relationship between the four psychological domains (PHQ-9, PANAS positive and negative, SF-12) and the Factor 4 (fruit and vegetable consumption) and 6 (fish consumption). This is in accordance with the study published by Annesi et al. [27] , who claimed that changes in physical exercise mediated the relationships between mood and increased fruit and vegetable consumption. Mediation may still exist in the absence of a significant association between dependent and independent variables, as reported by MacKinnon et al. [64] . Indeed, in our case, none of the psychological scales was associated with Factor 4, and only PHQ-9 and PANAS negative were associated with Factor 6, respectively, negatively and positively ( Figure 4) . MacKinnon et al. [64] and Kenny [65] described inconsistent mediation when the mediator acts as suppressor variable, in one of the following cases: indirect effect and total effect are opposite in sign, the estimate of the total effect is closer to zero than the direct effect, or the direct effect is larger than the total effect [66] . Given the above, exercise could be a suppressor variable that buffers the interaction between SF-12 and Factor 4 and 6, PHQ-9 and PANAS negative and Factor 6. The mediation effects of exercise in the links of PHQ-9 and SF-12 on nutritional Factors might suggest that some participants actively changed their lifestyle to deal with the health and psychological anticipated impact of the lockdown and tried to prevent it by increasing their physical exercise and modifying their diets.",

The main strength point is that diet monitoring was conducted for three-weeks using a 24 h recall method, instead of using simple surveys. Moreover, to our best knowledge, this is one of the first attempts to investigate the complicated relationship between dietary habits, psychological states and physical exercise using a mediation model. A limitation of the paper is that psychometric scales were collected only once during the monitoring period. Furthermore, we do not have data regarding the dietary habits pre-quarantine, which could have been useful in order to assess changes in nutrition and lifestyle behaviours consequent to the home-isolation. However, some effects of the Italian lockdown might reveal later than the short duration of this trial was able to observe. Another limitation is represented by the convenience sampling method, used for the recruitment of the participants. Future studies could focus on the psychological and physiological mechanisms underlying the changes in dietary habits following different training modalities.",

Indeed, exercise showed to have both a direct effect, influencing fresh fruit and vegetables and fish consumption, and an indirect effect on nutritional choices, counterbalancing the impact of negative psychological states on the dietary habits. Poorer mental health possibly led to unhealthy diets, which can themselves be linked to negative mood levels, in a vicious circle. Overall, exercise led to healthier nutritional choices and, mediating the effects of mood states; it might represent a key measure in particular situations, such as a home-confinement due to a pandemic.",

Nutrients 2020, 12, x FOR PEER REVIEW 9 of 17 A multivariate analysis of variance was conducted to assess if gender, BMI, training load and mood states were significantly associated with the linear combination of seven latent factors deriving from factor analysis. No different effects of training volume (duration) or intensity (perceived exertion) have been found, so training load was considered as the only measure of exercise performed. Box's Test of Equality of Covariance Matrices showed a p < 0.001, so Pillai's trace statistic was used. A significant difference was found for all predictor variables: gender, with Pillai trace = 0.019, F(2593,7) = 7.02, p < 0.001; ID, with Pillai trace = 1.474, F(18193,861) = 5.63, p < 0.001; PANAS positive score, with Pillai trace = 0.008, F(2593,7) = 2.69, p = 0.009; PANAS negative score, with Pillai trace = 0.006, F(2593,7) = 2.14, p = 0.037; SF12, with Pillai trace = 0.007, F(2593,7) = 2.69, p = 0.009; PHQ-9 total score, with Pillai trace = 0.009, F(2593,7) = 3.26, p = 0.002; BMI, with Pillai trace = 0.008, F(2593,7) = 3.05, p = 0.003 and finally training load, with Pillai trace = 0.008, F(2593,7) = 2.94, p = 0.004.
