However, the presentation of infection can range from asymptomatic to critical illness which has led to categorisation of disease based on severity of symptoms. One definition of severe COVID-19 is the need for admission to an intensive care unit and need for a ventilator/supplementary oxygen which is less likely in mild to moderate COVID-19. The need for hospitalisation is mainly due to infection of the lower respiratory tract and therefore inflammation of lung alveoli, also known as pneumonia. This can lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), sepsis and multi-organ failure which are some of the main causes of mortality in COVID patients [3] . Aside from classifying severity of disease based on symptoms, histopathological differences can also be used for classification purposes. For example, it has been suggested that the formation of hyaline membranes, due to lack of surfactant leading to alveolar collapse, are characteristic of pneumonia and therefore of severe COVID-19 [3] .",

Cytokines usually act as a signal for innate immune cells, such as neutrophils and macrophages, to move to the site of infection. However, when this is inappropriately sustained, the increased vascular permeability can lead to pulmonary consolidation and other lung tissue injury. In addition to accumulation of pulmonary exudates, the signalling cascade can result in apoptosis of lung epithelial cells which can lead to the complication of ARDS since oxygen transfer is severely impaired. Studies have reported a correlation of higher levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g. IL-6) and inflammatory markers (e.g. C-reactive protein (CRP)) with more severe clinical presentations [3] . There is also evidence that type 1 interferon, an antiviral defence, is suppressed during the initial phase of the disease, which promotes the over-activity of the inflammatory pathway underlying disease severity [5] . The combination of low interferon levels and high pro-inflammatory cytokines is what indicates the dysregulated innate immune response to COVID.",

Baricitinib is an example of an anti-inflammatory rheumatoid arthritis drug that has been repurposed to help buffer the cytokine storm that leads to lung injury [6] . Furthermore, evidence of under expression of IFNAR2, which encodes the receptor of interferon, amongst severe COVID patients has led to clinical trials of interferons to reduce mortality rate [4] . In addition, genomic analyses could reveal new therapeutic targets for drug development. 3CLpro, PLpro and RdRp, the main enzymes responsible for SARS-COV-2 replication using host machinery, emerged as potential therapeutic targets [7] .",

Genetic susceptibility to obesity was found in MR studies to be associated with increased risk of infection [13] . The authors suggest that obesity could be causally linked to infection because of impaired lung function, increased baseline adipokines and cytokines which increase risk to developing ARDs.

A novel rule-based algorithm is used to categorize the phenotypes and the types of regressions, adjusted for the confounders. Based on these, the output of the software is result files depending on each test type: linear, logistic, ordered logistic and multinomial regressions. In addition, the results include a log-file providing information about the processing flow for each field and a model-fit-log file that shows model fit output for categorical unordered models. Lastly, the variable-flow-counts-all file, which includes a set of counts denoting the number of variables reaching each point in the processing flow, for example whether the variable has been analysed or has been excluded, or if some categories from the categorical fields have been excluded, are also provided in the results. In addition, for the continuous data, the inverse normal rank transformation is used to make certain they are normally distributed.

Severe COVID-19 risk was associated with decreased levels of SHBG. SHBG has a major role in balancing testosterone levels as it has a greater affinity for it more than oestrogen [41] .
