As of June 2021, there have been greater than 172 million cases reported worldwide, including more than 3.7 million deaths [1] . The initial manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 vary, and usually occur between one and 14 days from exposure to the virus. Risk factors identified for COVID-19 include male gender, obesity, cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, and older age [2] [3] [4] [5] . The most common initial symptoms include fever, cough, fatigue, and loss of smell or taste [6] . During this period, the virus infects the epithelial cells through the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptors and may eventually present as a viral pneumonia.",

This identification has led to significant clinical questions regarding the optimal prevention and management of CAC, which in turn, has led to many ongoing clinical trials. To help guide the management of these patients in the interim, numerous major societies have put forth recommendations regarding diagnosis, monitoring, and treatment of CAC. In this report, we discuss the pathogenesis, prevalence, diagnosis, and treatment of CAC to help providers understand this complicated condition and to apply best practices to the care of their patients.",

As a result of limited studies, there are many clinical scenarios that are yet to be addressed, with expert opinion varying on a number of important clinical issues regarding CAC management. In this review, we utilize current societal guidelines to provide a framework for practitioners in managing their patients with CAC. To supplement the manuscript, we have provided three clinical scenarios (supplemental material) which implement important principles of anticoagulation in patients with COVID-19. Overall, decisions should be made on a case by cases basis and based on the providers understanding of each patient's medical history, clinical course and perceived risk.",

In severe COVID-19 disease, excess proinflammatory cytokines trigger the coagulation system resulting in a hypercoagulable state [29] . In addition to direct damage by viral invasion, this cytokine storm also results in endothelial injury and dysfunction, leading to endothelial cell activation [30] . The dysfunctional endothelial cells produce excess thrombin as well as shutdown fibrinolysis, leading to a prothrombotic state [31] . Furthermore, infection induced inflammatory changes in endothelial cells have been shown to increase coagulation biomarkers, including factor VIII, von Willebrand Factor (vWF), fibrinogen and P-selectin [24, 32] . All of these mechanisms create an imbalance in the normal hemostatic system, with a resulting prothrombotic state, manifesting as both macro and micro-vascular thrombosis [30] .",

            "text": "In patients with CAC, biomarkers supporting the hypercoagulability pathogenesis have been demonstrated to be elevated in vivo. Specifically, the procoagulant markers Factor VIII, Von Willebrand antigen and Von Willebrand activity have been found to be markedly elevated in patients with COVID-19 who develop thromboembolism [33] . Biochemically, this hypercoagulable state appears to be most significant in those patients with the most severe form of the disease. One study demonstrated that many prothrombotic markers are increased above their upper limit of normal in patients with COVID-19, with the greatest increase in patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) as compared to non-ICU patients [34] . In support of this recognition, descriptive studies using viscoelastic hemostasis assays including thromboelastography (TEG) and rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM) in patients with COVID-19 are more consistent with a hypercoagulable state rather than acute disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). For example, in a study of 24 ICU patients with COVID-19, TEG parameters demonstrated a hypercoagulable state with decreased K (kinetic) time (increased fibrinogen activity), increased alpha angle (increased fibrinogen activity), increased maximum amplitude (Ma) (increased platelet activity), and decreased LY30 (decreased fibrinolysis) [33] . These findings suggest decreased time to clot accumulation, increased strength and stability of the clot, and decreased breakdown of the clot. This study also found that fibrinogen, D-dimer, C-reactive protein, Factor VIII, vWF and protein C were all increased, while platelet count was normal or increased, prothrombin time (PT) and partial thromboplastin time (PTT) were near normal and antithrombin (AT) was marginally decreased. These discoveries are all consistent with a hypercoagulable state rather than DIC where one would expect decreased platelet count and increased PT and PTT. In another study of 21 ICU patients with COVID-19, the TEG MA was significantly higher in those with high thrombotic events (\u22652 thrombotic events, defined as an arterial, central venous, or dialysis catheter or filter thromboses) compared to those with low thrombotic events (0-1 thrombotic events) [35] . Moreover, the mean fibrinogen and D-dimer levels were elevated in those with high thrombotic events although there was no significant differences in PT, international normalized ratio (INR), PTT or platelets between the two groups.",

Platelets in patients with COVID-19 have been found to have increased activity compared to healthy patients, with increased aggregation, thromboxane generation and platelet activation [40] . It is unclear whether these changes in platelet function are associated with an increased risk of thrombosis [39, 41] . One study in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 found that a platelet count >450 \u00d7 109/L on admission was associated with an increased risk of VTE (adjusted OR of 3.56 [95% CI, 1.27-9.97]) [20] . However, another study of 1476 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 found that the platelet count was inversely associated with risk of in-hospital mortality, although, it is unclear if this increased risk in mortality was a result of consumption in the context of DIC [42] . The appropriate workup of a decreasing platelet count and thrombocytopenia should be pursued in the COVID-19 patient as it would be for non-COVID patients. Given that the majority of patients with COVID-19 receive some form of heparin, a diagnosis of heparininduced thrombocytopenia (HIT) may be considered, and the subsequent use of Platelet Factor 4 (PF4) and platelet serotonin release assay (SRA) can be used to diagnose this potentially lifethreatening condition.",

This finding raises the question of whether the thrombotic related biomarker, lupus anticoagulant is affected by COVID-19 disease [43, 44] . The lupus anticoagulant is an immunoglobulin which binds to phospholipids and proteins associated with the cell membrane. When evaluated in vitro, these immunoglobulins interfere with the phospholipids which induce coagulation, leading to a prolonged PTT. In vivo, however, these antibodies are often prothrombotic [45] . Two studies of patients with COVID-19 and prolonged PTT on initial presentation have demonstrated high rates of lupus anticoagulant positivity [15, 43] . However, it has been noted that upon repeat testing, many patients become negative, suggesting that the lupus anticoagulant positivity may be transient and associated with severe viral illness [46] . Overall, more studies are needed to determine if lupus anticoagulant is truly associated with COVID-19 and related to an increase in VTE, and if so, whether the use of anticoagulation should be changed based on the presence of this abnormality [47] .",

If the computed tomography (CT) is not available or the patient is too unstable, a lower limb ultrasound to assess for a proximal DVT, or an echocardiography to assess right heart strain may be pursued.

With COVID-19 triggering a systemic inflammatory response, it is likely D-dimers will be elevated whether thromboembolic disease is present or not. Therefore, none of the major societies recommend any role for routine monitoring of D-dimer, with its use limited to risk stratification as per ISTH-IG and ASH. Furthermore, the CDC guidelines specifically state that there is insufficient data to recommend for or against using hematologic and coagulation parameters to guide management decisions in CAC. The ACF guidelines also states that using biomarkers such as D-dimer for guiding anticoagulation management should only be done in the setting of a clinical trial. One society's guidelines, the ACC, mentions a potential role for the use of biomarkers in decision-making: in patients with a D-dimer >2 times the upper limit may be considered for extended prophylaxis (up to 45 days) if patients are at low risk of bleeding. Currently, a multicenter randomized controlled trial is underway to evaluate the efficacy and safety of antithrombotic strategies in COVID-19 adults not requiring hospitalization at time of diagnosis. The trial is designed to compare aspirin, low dose and regular dose apixaban prophylaxis and placebo, with the results of VTE compared across increasing D-dimer levels [58] . This study will help ascertain the value of baseline D-dimer levels in this population. Another clinical trial, ATTACC, was performed to determine whether therapeutic anticoagulation improved organ support-free days [59] . This study also assessed the efficacy of therapeutic anticoagulation across subgroups based on initial D-dimer level. The D-dimer level did not appear to be useful in risk stratification. When considering other biomarkers, none of the major societal guidelines recommend a change to the anticoagulation regimen in patients with COVID19 who have positive antiphospholipid antibodies or any other biomarker abnormality. Finally, although viscoelastic hemostasis assays such as TEG and ROTEM may suggest hypercoagulability, the ASH guidelines specifically recommend against the routine use of these tests to guide management.",

The majority of societal guidelines have recommended once daily administration using low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) to reduce healthcare worker exposure given the lower frequency of administration compared to unfractionated heparin (UFH), to conserve personal protective equipment and because it has a lower risk for heparin-induced thrombocytopenia. LMWH may not be preferred over UFH when the risk of bleeding outweighs the risk of thrombosis and in patients with renal dysfunction (i.e. creatinine clearance <30 mL/min). An additional benefit of heparin is its possible anti-inflammatory effects in both the vasculature and the airway [59] . With COVID-19 stimulating a proinflammatory state in both the airways and vasculature, heparin not only provides value as an anticoagulant but also may exert benefit as an antiinflammatory agent [60] . The efficacy of heparin as an antiinflammatory agent in patients with COVID-19 warrants further investigation.",

            "text": "The dosing of prophylactic anticoagulation remains controversial given that some studies have demonstrated that up to one quarter of patients with COVID in the ICU develop VTE despite thromboprophylaxis [17, 22, 61] . As a result, it has been suggested that intermediate or therapeutic doses of LMWH could be considered [10, 12, 62, 63] . There is emerging evidence that initiation of therapeutically dosed anticoagulation in place of prophylactically dosed anticoagulation may decrease the need for mechanical ventilation and other life supporting interventions in non-critically ill hospitalized population but this has not been published in a peer review journal [59] . With thrombosis being a prominent feature of COVID-19, three clinical trials conducted a multiplatform clinical trial (ATTACC) to determine whether therapeutic anticoagulation improved organ support-free days (ICU level care and receipt of mechanical ventilation, vasopressors, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) or high-flow nasal oxygen). Although full results have not been published, the prepublication, non-peer-reviewed, interim results show that patients who are moderately ill (hospitalized but not on ICU organ-support) had improved organ support-free days with therapeutically dosed anticoagulation in comparison to standard of care [64] . However, full-dose anticoagulation when started in critically ill patients with COVID19 was not found to be beneficial and may be harmful. Current societal guidelines which do not account for these interim findings do not recommend the use of therapeutically dosed anticoagulation as a replacement for prophylactically dosed anticoagulation. Until the results of these studies are published and validated, following current guidelines seems reasonable. Of note, ASH published new guidelines in March 2021 which continue to recommend prophylactically dosed anticoagulation in the context of hospitalized patients diagnosed with COVID-19 [65] .",

They also suggest an increased intensity of venous thromboprophylaxis could be considered for critically ill patients (i.e. LMWH 40 mg SC twice daily, LMWH 0.5 mg/kg subcutaneous twice daily, heparin 7500 SC three times daily, or low-intensity heparin infusion).

The CDC guidelines state that patients who have thrombosis of catheters or extracorporeal filters should be treated according to standard institutional protocols (which may include increasing anticoagulation intensity) for patients without COVID-19. Our institution, the Massachusetts General Hospital found that a low dose heparinized saline protocol is associated with improved duration of arterial line patency in critically ill COVID-19 patients [73] .

LMWH is preferred over UFH when no imminent procedures are planned, the risk of thrombosis is greater than the risk of bleeding, and patients do not have significant renal failure. In addition to LMWH, the ACCP guidelines also recommend fondaparinux over UFH with a similar rationale, and fondaparinux may be used in patients with suspected or confirmed HIT. UFH may be preferred in patients who need imminent procedures, are at high risk of bleeding or have significant renal failure. In patients with recurrent VTE despite therapeutic LMWH anticoagulation, the ACCP guidelines recommends increasing the dose of LMWH by 25-30%. While direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) have advantages including no need for monitoring, none of the major societal guidelines recommend their use in this critical care setting given their lack of timely reversal at some hospitals. Parenteral anticoagulants also have no known drug-drug interactions with COVID-19 therapies, and this may not be true with DOACs.",

There are a number of case series that suggest the use of thrombolytics in patients with severe ARDS and COVID-19 may lead clinical improvement [75, 76] . Given this potential benefit, there are a number of ongoing clinical trials investigating the use of parenteral and nebulized thrombolytic therapy for patients with severe COVID-19 ARDS. If a PE is suspected, consultation with a pulmonary embolism response team (PERT) is advised if available. These teams can provide expert advice regarding issues related to diagnosis and management of a PE in patients with COVID-19. If PERT consultation is unavailable, the National PERT Consortium paper has provided an algorithm to assist in decision-making for patients with a suspected PE [52] . Our institution, the Massachusetts General Hospital, has a PERT team which is a multidisciplinary team composed of experts from cardiology, cardiac surgery, emergency medicine, hematology, pulmonary and critical care, radiology, and vascular medicine and delivers immediate and evidence-based care to patients with suspected or confirmed high risk PE [77] . When major societal guidelines do recommend thrombolytic therapy, it is in the clinical context where their use would otherwise be clinically indicated such as STEMI, acute ischemic stroke, or high-risk massive PE with hemodynamic instability and when the benefits outweigh the risks of administration. In general, thrombolytic therapy is not recommended in patients who have a PE and are hemodynamically stable [57] .",

It is not uncommon for patients with COVID-19 to have baseline coagulation abnormalities of PT and PTT. Although these abnormalities are not contraindications to anticoagulation, it may lead to difficulties measuring heparin effectiveness. When in doubt, the majority of society guidelines (ACF, ASH, ACF and ACCP) advise that therapeutic anticoagulation should be monitored with an anti-Xa level rather than PTT. The SCC-ISTH guideline does not make any particular recommendations but does mention that expert clinical guidance statements and clinical pathways from large academic healthcare systems target for therapeutic anticoagulation, an anti-factor Xa level of 0.3-0.7 IU/mL for UFH. While the ACF guideline recommends monitoring of anti-Xa levels to monitor UFH due to potential baseline PTT abnormalities and heparin resistance (>35,000 U heparin over 24 hours), they also mention that it is reasonable to monitor anti-Xa or PTT in patients with normal baseline PTT levels and in those unlikely to have heparin resistance. There is evidence in the value of implementing an anticoagulation protocol using systemic unfractionated heparin, dosed by anti-factor Xa levels. At our institution, The Massachusetts General Hospital, we found that patients with COVID-19 infection on CRRT had lower rates of CRRT filter clotting and loss when using this protocol where systemic unfractionated heparin was dosed by anti-factor Xa levels [74] .

Heparin resistance should be suspected when disproportionately large doses of heparin are required to achieve therapeutic anticoagulation. This problem is usually due to low heparin concentrations, which results from binding of heparin to acute phase proteins in the context of systemic inflammation. There is also some evidence of AT deficiency in COVID-19 patients which may contribute to suspected heparin resistance [48] . Heparin functions as an anticoagulant by binding to AT, activating it, and then inhibiting clotting factors, most notably factor Xa [80] . A way to measure the capacity of the heparin-AT complex is with anti-Xa levels. It has been well documented that patients with COVID-19 may have artefactual increases in PTT, and therefore measuring anti-Xa levels may be a more accurate way to assess the level of anticoagulation in these situations. Additionally, LMWH can't be measured with PTT, and as a result, anti-Xa levels may be used to ensure appropriate anticoagulation levels have been achieved if necessary. Unfortunately, not all centers have the capacity to monitor anti-Xa levels.",

UFH) may be preferred in many ill patients given it may be withheld temporarily and has no known drug-drug interactions with COVID-19 therapies. LMWH may be preferred in patients who are unlikely to need procedures as there are concerns with UFH regarding the time to achieve therapeutic PTT and increased exposure to healthcare workers. DOACs have advantages including lack of monitoring that is ideal for outpatient management but may have risks in settings of organ dysfunction related to clinical deterioration and lack of timely reversal at some centers.In patients with moderate or severe COVID-19 on chronic therapeutic anticoagulation who develop suspected or confirmed DIC without overt bleeding, it is reasonable to consider the indication of anticoagulation and risk of bleeding for adjusting dose or discontinuation of anticoagulation. The majority of authors recommended reducing the intensity of anticoagulation unless there was an exceedingly high risk of thrombosis.A multidisciplinary PERT may be helpful for intermediate and high-risk patient with VTE. For hemodynamically high-risk PE, systemic fibrinolysis is indicated with catheter-based therapies reserved for situations that are not amenable to systemic fibrinolysis. Patients with hemodynamically stable intermediatelow or intermediate-high risk PE should receive anticoagulation and rescue systemic fibrinolysis should be considered in cases of further deterioration with catheter-directed therapies as an alternative. Catheter directed therapies should be limited to most critical situations given minimal data showing mortality benefit. When considering fibrinolysis vs percutaneous coronary intervention for STEMI, clinicians should weigh risks and severity of STEMI presentation, severity of COVID-19 in patient, risk of COVID-19 to individual clinicians and healthcare system. and malignancy may also be contributing. Treating the underlying cause is the most important component of treating DIC, with transfusion targets the same as for active bleeding. If there is no active bleeding, replacement of fibrinogen and coagulation factors remain controversial. However, if platelet count is <10 x 10^9/L, platelets should be transfused.",
