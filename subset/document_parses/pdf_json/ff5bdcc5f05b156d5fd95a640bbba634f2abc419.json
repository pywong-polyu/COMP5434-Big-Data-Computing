In their aim to foster evolved rather than uprooted cultural values, the authors of this research note suggest an educational approach to promote the concept and the implementation of what they refer to as authentic development. They propose interdisciplinary courses that include notions of history, sociology and economy. Their methodology is based on two main resources: (1) a textbook providing a broad historical survey tracing the development of 28 nations in the Americas; and (2) analytical parameters related to the extent of social interaction and income generation. Students carry out digital and group research and elaborate the conditions that generate social harmony, economic well-being and a better balance between them. The authors have already piloted their educational approach in four secondary schools in Antigua, Guatemala with 50 students aged 17-19. Most of them are now enrolled at local universities, but the impact of this course on their performance will only emerge over time.",

Tried-and-tested strategies have included microcredit, 1 social enterprises 2 and family planning (birth control). Nobel Peace Prize laureate Muhammad Yunus founded a microcredit organisation in 1976 that helped many women in Bangladesh to build well-being by granting them small loans. Yunus also coined the term social business, which is similar to the idea of social enterprise (Yunus 1999 (Yunus , 2009 ). Economist Nobel Prize laureate W. Arthur Lewis was concerned with \"the growth of output per head of population\" (Lewis 2003 (Lewis [1955 , p. 9). In 2003, Abhijit Banerjee and Esther Duflo founded the Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab (J-Pal) at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) to study poverty. Unequal distribution of resources is one of the elements that hinder development. Human development theorist Denis Goulet observed that: a comprehensive ethic of authentic development looks to the sustainable use of [all] resources as well as to their equitable distribution (Goulet 1996, p. 199) .",

In a book published in 1802, Italian philosopher Antonio Genovesi suggested that culture and civilisation are necessary to promote socio-economic wellbeing (Genovesi 2013 (Genovesi [1802 ). After conducting a survey attempting to measure individual happiness in relation to gross national happiness (GNH) parameters in Bhutan, Prabhat Pankaj and Tshering Dorji (2004) conclude that their findings suggest that even though \"income perhaps does add to happiness [\u2026] it is a weak variable\" (ibid., p. 387). Jeffrey D. Sachs (2005) identified possible solutions to poverty that afflicts different nations in terms of economic, social and environmental problems. Politicians such as Robert F. Kennedy affirmed, already in 1968 , that gross national product (GNP) 3 measures everything except that which is worthwhile (Kennedy 1968) .

The recent escalation of migratory processes is one macroscopic example of the struggle between economic well-being and ethnic traditions. New development models aiming to bridge the narrow outlooks from economic and social disciplines have emerged. These models span from rational adoptions of concepts typical of the two disciplines to the development of interdisciplinary courses combining economic and social sciences for the education of young generations. The field of behavioural economics, for example, pursues a \"method of economic analysis that applies psychological insights into human behaviour to explain economic decision-making\" (OUP n.d.) .",

Our aim is not to give to the students established formulas to calculate socio-economic parameters to be used for viable development models. Rather, our aim is to develop a culture that emphasises a balance of human values and economic well-being within the historical perspective offered by the textbook. The evaluation of the relationship F/G between the two parameters has primary significance in our attempt to consider and express a guideline for new development models. The value F/G ~ 1 (or F=G, see Figure 1 ) represents a wellbalanced society, assumed as a reference state (note that for a balanced society to be a productive one, both F and G ought to be > 1). A society in which excessive weight is given to economic development (e.g. the United States [USA]) corresponds to F/G < 1, and a society where social harmony prevails over economic development (e.g. Guatemala) corresponds to F/G > 1. It is to be stressed that both rich and economically depressed countries need to adjust their F and G parameters to approach the situation of authentic development F/G ~ 1.",

As fractions, percentages are dimensionless and can be measured on a numerical scale neglecting the different dimensionalities of the factors included in F or G. A dimensionless numerical value of the cumulative percentage of growth for each year over a range of years is produced by adding the measured percentage growth in G and F published in each successive year. For instance, G may be assumed to change according to predicted (published) alterations that reflect yearly variations of GDP for a particular country. These data, plotted as in Figure 1 , will produce a co-evolution graph showing how the two parameters keep pace with each other. The distance between the co-evolution graph and the ideal F=G line can be defined and computed, thus giving a measure of how a proposed or historical development model approaches ideal, authentic development.",

Moreover, the implementation of viable models would encounter serious difficulties, particularly when strong ethnic differences occur. For instance, the cultural incompatibility between Native Americans and European colonists is mainly due to the desire of the former to preserve their traditions and protect the environment for the next generations. Native Americans would not oppose useful innovations and, in our view, could work harmoniously with a US government under a clearer statement of their cultural identity. In Brazil, a lack of conflicting interests has produced a remarkable harmony between various ethnic groups. Nevertheless, explicit discrimination still affects dark-skinned individuals. In similar cases, no amount of education will help socio-economic development unless the current administration systems change their colonialist nature, or the economy is willing to share leadership with Black people.",

For the propaedeutic classes in history, sociology and economy we invited specialists who were interested in participating in the project. Each chapter, focusing on one American nation, includes a scholarly description of the main historical events and a brief presentation of data on its territory, its ethnic composition and current socio-economic situation. Each chapter also includes a brief insight into how the successes or difficulties of the individual country relate to cultural and historical events and to the evolution of that country's national identity or, indeed, identities.",

They could analyse the book chapters with a view to tertiary study and select the best combination of teachers for each class. Considering that the textbook provides adequate descriptions of historical events, the panel could perhaps even be limited to a sociologist and an economist. Another alternative would be a single professional with experience or degrees in both economics and sociology.",

It should also be remarked that although the present courses were designed for English-or Spanish-speaking students in the Americas, the approach based on the interdisciplinary focus on redevelopment issues might be extended to other regions. The project's sponsor, the Jepa-Limmat Foundation, 10 would assist any learning institution in the Americas willing to consider the establishment of interdisciplinary socio-economic courses. One distinct outcome of implementing the project's courses will be the preparation of qualified professionals who can support a balance between social harmony and wealth distribution and the mitigation of ethnic and class conflicts, thus promoting a better functioning of democracy in both developed and developing countries.
