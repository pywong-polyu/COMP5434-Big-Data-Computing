The proportion of fatal cases who die rapidly remains approximately constant across age-groups ( Figure S4 , Table S3 ). These observations, combined with the substantial differences in risk of death by age and sex, suggest complex patterns of disease manifestation. The underlying mechanisms that can explain why subsets of the population are substantially more at risk than others remain unclear although a role for immunopathogenesis has been proposed, including through antibody-dependent enhancement, where non-neutralizing antibodies trigger an immune response through cytokine storms, and cell-based enhancement, such as with allergic inflammation (10) (11) (12) .

Assuming a basic reproductive number of R0=3.3, it would require around 70% of the population to be immune for the epidemic to be controlled by immunity alone.
