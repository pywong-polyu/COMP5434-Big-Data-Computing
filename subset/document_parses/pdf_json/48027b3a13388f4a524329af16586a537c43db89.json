The analysis results reveal significant financial contagion in most developed and emerging markets having significant trade relationships with China during COVID-19 syndrome. The evidence about financial contagion is vital for regulators and different classes of market participants for varying purposes, and hence the results should find practical implications similar to policymakers, investors, and risk managers.",

Since then, the world has always feared such a novel pathogen's recurrence that may cause a global contagion. The fear turned into reality when the novel Coronavirus surfaced in Wuhan province in China. Little was anticipated that the COVID-19, in such a short span, would turn into a global menace, a \"Black Swan\" with severe economic and financial repercussions (Goodell, 2020) . The vulnerability of the situation can be assessed by how the financial markets responded to this new development by recording a steep fall in all the benchmark indices, indicating the financial markets' fragility (Akhtaruzzaman et al., 2020) .",

            "text": "Past research documented stock markets' responses to such outbreaks (Bhuyan et al., 2010) , reporting that the infected country's asset returns exhibited increased cross-market linkages. Moreover, given the size of the pandemic's impact, it is imperative to study its aftermath on financial markets as it may provide new clues about how contagion can flow in through alternate channels contributing to financial upheavals. Forbes and Rigobon (2002) 1 define financial contagion as a significant increase in market co-movement after a shock to one country and differentiates it from interdependence. Research into financial contagion has spoken about contagion either in equity markets (Kenourgios et al., 2011) or the commodity market (Wang et al., 2019) . Further attempts were made to study contagion through the trade links channel (Akhtaruzzaman and Shamsuddin, 2016; Akhtaruzzaman et al., 2021) but practically remained silent about the derivative markets. Against Akhtaruzzaman et al. (2021) 's previous work exploring the contagion's flow during economic downturns caused by the financial crisis, especially the global financial crisis, the current paper analyzed contagion result of the sudden development of the COVID-19 syndrome, a major health hazard that emanated from China and spillovers to its major trading partners. Thus, it would be interesting to document such contagion effects in derivative markets, more so through the lens of financial (Kaminsky and Reinhart, 2002) and thru periods of a worldwide pandemic. For the stated reason, the paper develops a framework to answer these questions; whether there is a significant increase in cross-market linkages during crises.",

Furthermore, the study documents the contagion effect of COVID-19 on most countries. The empirical results are based on examining the three-block set-up. First, analyzing the entire period covering from 1st August 2015 to 31st July 2020. Second, the tranquil period from 1st August to 30th November 2019, and lastly, the crises period of 1st December 2019 to 31st July 2020. 2 The period was mainly considered to isolate the transmission of China's contagion on its trading partners resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic and avoid any other events that may have impacted the study's results and robustness. Against the popularly used spot markets, this paper uses the futures markets. As it is welldocumented in the literature that the futures market disseminates information faster into the prices than the spot market and hence aid in effective price discovery and thus serve as a better representative for asset markets (Banerjee et al., 2020; Bohl et al., 2011; Wu et al., 2005; Xu and Wan, 2015) .",

The DCC GARCH, unlike constant conditional correlation (CCC) GARCH and BEKK GARCH specification (Engle 2002; Tse and Tsui, 2002) , as previous literature has unveiled that dynamic conditional correlation (DCC) GARCH yielded a more accurate estimation of conditional variances, whereas the study by Cappiello et al. (2006) showed that asymmetric dynamic conditional correlation (ADCC) GARCH model outclasses the DCC GARCH model with lower Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) and higher log-likelihood value, and better adaptive to model the time-varying market integration. Besides, DCC GARCH does not account for asymmetries in conditional variances, covariances, and correlations, leading to an incorrect specification of the conditional variance-covariance matrix (Cappiello et al., 2006; de Goeij and Marquering, 2009 ). Following Cappiello et al. (2006) and Hou and Li (2016) , this paper used the Asymmetric DCC GARCH model (ADCC), which incorporates the leverage effect into the conditional correlations. The rest of the paper's organization is as follows: Section 2 presents the data and descriptive statistics. Section 3 describes the methodology. Section 4 of the empirical results are presented, and Section 5 concludes the paper.",

Further, incorporating foreign exchange (FX) rates may spike additional volatility from the foreign exchange markets that might not be related to volatility in the index futures market (Sim and Zurbreugg, 1999) . Studies by Hou and Li (2016) and Mink (2015) suggested that currency hedging in the forward markets may moderate the currency risk. Given this, the incorporation of the FX rate is evaded. China's main trading partners are presented in Fig. 1 . Table 1 reports the descriptive statistics of each index's future returns. The JB statistics suffices all the return series exhibit skewness and excess kurtosis and the non-normality condition. Fig. 2 presents the daily index futures returns of the CSI 300 against the trading partners' index futures market. China's index futures returns are more volatile in the pre-crisis period against the trading partners' ones. As seen in Fig. 2 , the trading partners' returns exhibit an abrupt surge and all the more volatile against the CSI 300 daily in the crisis period, which may be attributed to the sudden development of uncertainty arising out of the COVID-19 crisis.",

The results reject the null hypothesis of the ADF test and PP tests of the presence of unit root in all the index futures return series, and then they are used in the estimation of the VAR model. The best lag order is selected using the Final Prediction Error (FPE) criterion, Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), and Likelihood Ratio Criterion (LR) criterion for the VAR model. After VAR modeling, 4 diagnostic tests have been performed on residuals to check for serial correlation and ARCH effect. The results of the test indicate that the residuals are free from serial and ARCH effects. After the VAR model's calibration, the next step is to run the ADCC EGARCH on the VAR equations' residuals.

Table 3 presents the results of presents the results ADCC EGARCH (1,1) model for the full period following (Arouri et al., 2011) . The results show that the ARCH and GARCH effects parameters, \u03b1 and \u03b2 are significant at an appropriate significance level, and their sum is less than one, thus sufficing the necessary condition of the finiteness of the conditional variances. Further, \u03b2 is higher than \u03b1 in all the series, indicating that the past variances tend to dominate the current variances. The leverage effect coefficient \u03b3 is positive and statistically significant at appropriate levels indicating that the negative shocks have a higher impact than the positive shocks. Both the ADCC parameters a and b are positive, and the sum is less than one to ensure positive definiteness. Parameters a and b, which are associated with short and long-term persistence of shocks on the dynamic conditional correlations, are significant. The exception being South Korea, Netherlands, and Canada was the short-term volatility persistence coefficient is found insignificant. The high values of b indicate the long-run persistence of volatility spillover among China's major trading partners. The joint distribution coefficient of shape (m) supports the best fit of the ADCC EGARCH based on Student-t distribution for both marginal and joint distribution represented by low values of the information criterion of AIC, BIC, and HQ. And that ADCC EGARCH is a better fit to model the time-varying conditional variances. The paper graphs the DCC in Fig. 3 . Table 4 shows the mean and variance of DCC values pre and during the crisis period, along with the contagion t-statistics. The mean and variance of the DCC for the crisis period are higher than that of the pre-crisis period. And the study finds empirical evidence of the contagion effect as a result of the COVID-19 crises emanating from China. Most developed and emerging markets, including the US, South Korea, Germany, India, Singapore, Taiwan, Russia, Australia, Canada, Brazil, Thailand, Italy, and Spain, have suffered contagion. The exception is Japan, Netherlands, the UK, France, where it was more interdependent than contagion. Therefore, the paper documents the contagion effect of COVID-19 on most of the developed and emerging futures markets that have trading relations with China.

Another finding is that both developed and emerging markets seem to suffer equally from the contagion effect. However, the analysis of the ADCC provides no evidence in favor of Japan, the Netherlands, the UK, and France. This paper has important policy implications that channels of contagion may not only arise out of financial crises, but a pandemic situation like COVID-19 can also have severe repercussions for the economy and financial markets, which policymakers need to take note of. Further, the paper's findings may be of interest to policymakers, investors, risk, and portfolio managers.",
