We used a telephone survey with random sampling and obtained a probability community sample of 616 adults (39.1% men; M age = 41.7, SD age = 16.3) in Macao, China in April 2020. The prevalence of 8.8% probable depression and 12.0% probable anxiety was observed in this sample. Positive perceptions toward government's pandemic responses were found to be negatively associated with probable depression and probable anxiety (ORu = .36 and .41, p < .05). Three lifestyle-changing stressors (i.e., increased family conflict, friendship deterioration, and weight gain), were commonly reported (29.9, 27.5, and 43.0% respectively), and displayed positive associations with probable depression (ORu = 1.67 to 1.87, p < .05) and probable anxiety (ORu = 1.54 to 2.10, p < .05). Our findings suggest protective effects of perceived trust and satisfaction regarding government's pandemic responses against mental distress and the potential mental health threats from three pandemic-specific lifestyle-changing stressors. These findings can inform clinicians and policymakers to better prepare for the mental health impacts of the current and future pandemics.",

            "text": "Ever since its outbreak in December 2019, Coronavirus Disease 2019 has posed unprecedented challenges to humankinds' physical and mental health on a global scale. By the end of July, the total number of confirmed COVID-19 cases worldwide had mounted to 17,106,007 and resulted in 668,910 deaths (World Health Organization [WHO], 2020a) . What is less visible from these numbers is how COVID-19 has afflicted people with regard to their mental health. Learning from past experience of similar public health crises, such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Ebola, the mental effects associated to epidemics and pandemics appear to be more intense, pervasive, and enduring than the merely physical effects of an infection (Cheng, 2004; Desclaux, Diop, Doyon, Hofman, & Au, 2017; Mak, Chu, Pan, Yiu, & Chan, 2009 ). Depression and anxiety are two commonly reported mental distress during pandemics (Taylor, 2019) . Although still limited in number and scope, the evidence thus far has underscored the emergence of depression and anxiety with the progress of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic in communities (e.g., E. P. H. Choi, Hui, & Wan, 2020; Gonz\u00e1lez-Sanguino et al., 2020; Qiu et al., 2020) , and these effects are potentially long lasting (Wang et al., 2020b) . These studies have also examined the correlates of mental distress during the COVID-19 pandemic, but most of them either explored sociodemographic correlates alone (e.g., Ahmed et al., 2020; Cao et al., 2020; Qiu et al., 2020) or focused on relatively general risk/protective factors (e.g., social media exposure; Gao et al., 2020) . Further research on pandemic-specific factors are warranted to inform clinicians and policymakers to develop more tailored measures to manage the next stage of battling with the coronavirus and its influence, as well as enrich our collective knowledge to better prepare for future epidemics/pandemics. In the present study, we aimed to examine whether public perceptions of government's pandemic responses and their experiences with respect to pandemic-imposed lifestyle changes were associated with probable depression and anxiety among Chinese community-dwelling adults in Macao, China.",

On the community level, a series of preventative measures were taken, which included, but were not limited to, compulsory quarantine for people returning from abroad, the shutdown of nonessential services, the recommendation to work and study from home, and a city lockdown. More detailed personal protective measures were issued on a personal level, such as wearing a face mask in public, proper hand washing, and social distancing. In addition to these overall measures, the Macao government implemented the Guaranteed Mask Supply for Macao Residents Scheme, which ensured a sufficient supply and orderly distribution of face masks to every resident (Macao SAR Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, 2020a); this scheme also effectively averted the panic buying and shortage of personal protective equipment that was observed in other regions (e.g., Leung, Lam, & Cheng, 2020) . Up to the end of July 2020, the Macao government had managed to contain the spread of the coronavirus to 46 confirmed cases (i.e., 44 imported, two import-related, and zero local infection) with zero mortality in Macao (Macao SAR Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, 2020b); the government's effective management of the disease is rather remarkable for a region with the highest population density in world.",

During different types of crises, positive public perceptions toward government/institutions, including public trust and satisfaction, have been key factors that not only enhance the public compliance with precautionary measures (Blair, Morse, & Tsai, 2017; Nilima, Kaushik, Tiwary, & Pandey, 2020; Vinck, Pham, Bindu, Bedford, & Nilles, 2019) , but also in their capacity to exert a protective effect against depression and anxiety (B\u00e4uerle et al., 2020) . In contrast, a lack of trust in government and/or its institutions has been found to be related to noncompliance with disease control interventions (Blair et al., 2017) and an elevated level of anxiety in the face of epidemics (Cheung & Tse, 2008; Hayllar, 2007) . Therefore, we hypothesized a negative correlation between positive perceptions toward government's pandemic responses and probable depression/anxiety reported by Chinese community-dwelling adults during the COVID-19 pandemic in the present study.",

Such restrictions may bring new stressors on both an interpersonal level, such as presenting challenges to one's social support system (e.g., family and friends) and on an intrapersonal level, in that one's physical health and selfimage (e.g., weight gain) may be threatened, and such stressors have been shown to be associated with higher levels of depression and/or anxiety (H. Choi & Marks, 2008; Jorm et al., 2003; Lee, Jobe, & Mathis, 2020) . Studies have revealed adverse outcomes of the COVID-19 pandemic on family relations, including deteriorated parent-child relationships after a one-month quarantine at home (Zheng, Li, Zhang, Jin, Li, Cao et al., 2020) , an upsurge in incidents of domestic violence (Bradbury-Jones & Isham, 2020), and a spike in divorce rates (Y.-L. Liu, 2020) . During the lockdown, lack of personal space and increased boredom at home (Wang, Zhang, Zhao, Zhang, & Jiang, 2020) , together with financial stress caused by the coronavirus-burdened economy (Romano, 2020) , are likely to be sources of increased family conflict. In the meantime, friendships are also challenged by a dramatic decrease in real-life interactions during the pandemic. In this study, we therefore examined how commonly the two interpersonal stressors (i.e., increased family conflict and friendship deterioration) were experienced during the pandemic among Chinese adults and whether they would be associated with probable depression and anxiety.",

On the one hand, the social distancing and stay-at-home orders tend to decrease individuals propensity to engage in physical activities and increase their tendency toward more sedentary activities, both of which contribute to a higher risk of weight gain (Rundle, Park, Herbstman, Kinsey, & Wang, 2020) . On the other hand, as COVID-19 is highly contagious, with potentially fatal outcomes, the virus is also likely to induce the likelihood of stress, which can lead to greater consumption of foods high in sugar and fat, contributing to the development of obesity (Torres & Nowson, 2007) . Weight gain, no matter how it occurs, has been found to be associated with elevated levels of depression and anxiety (Jorm et al., 2003) . Moreover, depressive mood and anxiety may further lower one's social and physical activity levels and exacerbate the vicious cycle of obesity and distress (de Wit et al., 2010) . In this study, we examined the extent to which Chinese adults experienced weight gain during the COVID-19 pandemic and whether this stressor was associated with probable depression and anxiety.",

We first randomly selected households from the latest Macao phonebook in the first stage and then invited one adult, the one who mostly recently had his/her birthday among all the eligible respondents in the household (i.e., last-birthday rule; Gaziano, 2008) , to take the survey in the second stage. Trained research assistants briefed the chosen respondents on the study aims and their rights as study participants. Only those who gave oral consent to participate in the study responded to the formal telephone survey, and no one received monetary incentives.

The Cronbach's alpha for depression and anxiety was .83 and .81, respectively. The total score of each subscale was multiplied by two to compute a composite score for depression and anxiety, which ranged from 0 to 42. A higher score indicated more symptoms of the corresponding mental distress. According to Moussa et al. (2001) , a set of four cutoff points was utilized to categorize depression symptoms at mild (\u2265 10), moderate (\u2265 14), severe (\u2265 21), and extremely severe (\u2265 28) levels, and for anxiety symptoms at mild (\u2265 8), moderate (\u2265 10), severe (\u2265 15), and extremely severe (\u2265 20) levels. Consistent with previous studies (Chen, Tong, Wu, Lau, & Zhang, 2018; Wang et al., 2020a) , the cutoff points for moderate levels were adopted for identifying probable cases with depression (i.e., \u2265 14; hereinafter probable depression) and anxiety (i.e., \u2265 10; hereinafter probable anxiety). Because the two DASS-21 subscales did not display a satisfactory discriminant validity in our study (i.e., both construct's average variance extracted [0.42 and 0.37] were smaller than their squared correlation [0.83] in the model; Fornell & Larcker, 1981) , we also computed an \"overall psychological distress\" composite score by summing up the depression and anxiety scores as an additional reference score for comparison.",

These percentages are lower than those observed in mainland China during the early outbreak of the pandemic (DASS-21 Depression [\u2265 14]: 16.5%, DASS-21 Anxiety [\u2265 10]: 28.8%, in data collected during 31st Jan to 2nd February 2020; Wang, Pan, et al., 2020a) and also lower than those from a recent study conducted in Hong Kong (PHQ-9 Depression [\u2265 10]: 19%, GAD Anxiety [\u2265 10]: 14%, in data collected during 24th April to 3rd May 2020; Choi et al., 2020) . The relatively lower prevalence of probable depression and anxiety was plausibly linked to the timing of our data collection (i.e., 11-20th April 2020), during which the pandemic seemed better under control locally with the incidences dropping to zero (from 8th April to 25th June 2020; Macao SAR Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, .20 *** .19 *** .22 *** .19 *** .21 *** .02 .34 *** .29 *** *** p < .001.

The identified protective and risk factors for probable depression/anxiety cases (by logistic regression analyses) were more or less identical to those for the symptom severity of depression, anxiety, and overall psychological distress (by multiple regression analyses). The invariance of these findings across analyses indicates that the salient protective and risk factors remained the same for those who suffered from both types of psychological distress across the severity spectrum in our sample. We may further infer from these findings that our identified protective and risk factors can be applied to different levels of preventions among community-dwelling Chinese adults to intervene before mental effects occur, screening to identify mental distress in the earliest, and managing related distress after diagnosis. In the following, we will discuss each of these identified proactive and risk factors in detail.",

            "text": "Consistent with our hypothesis, we found that favorable perceptions toward the government's proactive response to the pandemic was negatively associated with both depression and anxiety. Similar patterns of negative associations have been observed between public perceptions of strong leadership by the government and worries or depression in a 58-country survey during the COVID-19 pandemic (Fetzer et al., 2020) . The generally high public trust and satisfaction toward the government reported by the majority of our respondents (91.4-94.0%) appeared to be in line with the relatively lower prevalence of probable depression/anxiety in Macao when compared to neighboring regions. In addition, other studies have shown that the more confident and satisfied residents were with their government's leadership in combating the pandemic, the more likely they were to comply with those personal preventative measures advocated by the government (Nilima et al., 2020) . Therefore, these perceptions may be the key to promising pandemic-related outcomes in terms of both physical and mental health. The pandemic experience of Macao suggests that effective government measures are conducive to earning public trust and satisfaction, while such positive perceptions are highly plausible to inspire more confidence in these measures along with individuals' willingness to sacrifice their short-term interests for mass cooperation with the government and in the meantime lowering their mental distress. In those countries/regions with low public trust in, or satisfaction with, the government, related stakeholders are advised to utilize this virtuous cycle: through responding more promptly and effectively to the fluctuations of the ongoing COVID-19 outbreaks and future epidemics/pandemics, they may establish more favorable public perceptions toward epidemic/pandemic-related measures, which may also lessen the mental burdens associated with pandemics. When looking into the three lifestyle-changing stressors, we observed that a sizable proportion (29.9%, 27.5%, and 43.0%) of our respondents suffered to a certain extent from an increase in family conflict, deterioration in friendships, and weight gain, respectively, during the pandemic. As hypothesized, the former two interpersonal stressors were positively associated with probable depression/anxiety among Macao residents. In particular, the increased level of family conflict due to the pandemic reported by our Chinese respondents emerged as the most salient risk factor of their probable anxiety. For possible remedies, parents are advised to engage more in daily rituals that can improve family relationships and help to pass the time (World Health Organization [WHO], 2020b); government and related parties are recommended to be more alert to increased domestic violence during the pandemic and to collaborate with clinicians to provide therapeutic support (Bradbury-Jones & Isham, 2020; Campbell, 2020) . Proper use of social media for online interaction and communication may be promoted, particularly in older adults (Armitage & Nellums, 2020) , as a means to compensate for the lack of offline interpersonal contact. Weight gain also displayed a positive correlation with depression and anxiety symptoms, but it was a stronger risk factor for depression than for anxiety. The latter finding was consistent with previous studies (e.g., Rivenes, Harvey, & Mykletun, 2009; Strine et al., 2008) . To cope with pandemic-related lifestyle changes, which involve but are not limited to the aforementioned three stressors, tailored guidelines are needed to coach individuals on how to prevent and deal with the emergence of potential problems due to the lack of personal space at home, how to maintain an effective social support system in the face of social distancing, and how to regulate diet and increase exercise levels indoors (Mackolil & Mackolil, 2020) . Clinicians are recommended to consider these identified lifestyle-changing stressors during the early detection of and the intervention design for depression and anxiety. They may also design specialized trainings on emotional management through various online platforms to encourage citizens to enrich their knowledge and enhance their skills in performing daily activities to enhance mental health on their own and in the early identification of the potential need to seek professional help (Bavel et al., 2020; Taylor, 2019) .",

First, due to its cross-sectional design, we cannot trace changes in respondents' mental status over time and further test our hypotheses as the external environment changes, nor can we make causal inferences on the relations of the identified protective and risk factors to mental distress. The present study relies on subsequent studies with longitudinal or experimental designs for additional explorations, especially the plausible interaction between stressors and mental distress in a recursive loop. Second, self-constructed scales were used in this study to assess COVID-19 stressor variables because validated scales were not available, while a satisfactory discriminant validity of DASS-21 depression and anxiety subscales was not obtained in our study. Subsequent studies with broader scopes may further examine these scales. Third, as Macao provides a macro environment of few COVID-19 infections, we encourage replication studies of our findings in regions with more COVID-19 infections, so that the robustness of these pandemic-related factors can be tested. In addition, the focus of this study was on pandemic-related factors related to government and lifestyle changes only and thus missed other general trait factors, such as personal adaptive coping strategies (Polizzi, Lynn, & Perry, 2020) , which are worth further consideration together with our pandemic-specific factors. Therefore, future studies are encouraged to broaden the scope of protective and risk factors to delineate a more comprehensive picture of individuals' mental health under the conditions of a pandemic.",
