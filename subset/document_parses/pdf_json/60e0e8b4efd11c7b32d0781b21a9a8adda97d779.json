At the start, COVID-19 bought the world to a standstill. Today lakhs have lost their lives, many are still struggling on the death bed, and large numbers have lost their jobs. The world's conventional education system seems to come to a halt with the physical closure of all schools and institutions. Understanding the losses that occurred due to several diseases, the present world has to prepare a backup strategy to reduce the economic and human losses. The paper aims to identify the measures required for minimizing the losses caused by COVID-19 to human evolution. Further, this study proposes a working mechanism for several affected sectors during the disease. The paper also discusses the current challenges from the COVID-19 pandemic crisis and possible make-over in the working platform.",

Many apps /online portals have come to provide support and help students & teachers during this period to cover the losses that occurred due to the unavoidable circumstances (COVID-19). Make-over of the platform for learning can contribute to the prevention and quick recovery of public health while extenuating the impression on students and learning. Where health amenities are being threatened, schools/ colleges/ universities have started into makeshift holding centres during the pandemic. The education sector has enormous potential to contribute and shield our children and youth from becoming transmission carriers for COVID-19. Educational administrators can frame policies that can be used during the pandemics to make-over novel learning modules that can reach everyone, make the arrangements more robust, and prepare for emergencies (Mahaye, 2020) .",
