According to the WHO Strategic Expert Advisory Group (SAGE) and the Global Vaccine Safety Advisory Committee (GACVS), one of the goals of the COVID-19 vaccine communication plan is to achieve high acceptance and uptake [10] . The current acceptance of COVID-19 vaccines globally is approximately 35% to 98%, which varies greatly from country to country, further indicating the need for policymakers to understand public perceptions before large-scale vaccination [11] [12] [13] . This study was conducted to fill the information gap regarding this issue in Taiwan.",

            "text": "The perception of the severity of the COVID-19 pandemic is related to people's awareness of risks and encourages the public to further participate in disease prevention measures [14, 15] . This can also be verified as it is related to vaccinations during the H1N1 influenza pandemic and the subsequent formulation of prevention policies, corresponding to the theoretical structure of threat and response assessments in the use of the individual healthy behavior models [16] [17] [18] . When the public's perception of the severity of COVID-19 is higher, the willingness to implement preventative measures is higher [19] [20] [21] . Previous studies based on this theory showed that perceived severity of COVID-19 and the fear of contracting COVID-19 were positively associated with vaccine acceptance [22] . In addition, higher levels of risk exposure and negative attitudes toward general vaccination were associated with low vaccine acceptance [23] . Since the COVID-19 pandemic is not severe in Taiwan, the authors wondered about whether the impact of risk perception on vaccine acceptance is still sustained in Taiwan. Therefore, we conducted this national survey to evaluate the impact of risk perception on public acceptance regarding COVID-19 vaccines and the factors influencing willingness to vaccinate in Taiwan. In addition, we investigated the impact of risk perception on recommended personal health protective behavior, such as handwashing, mask wearing, and social distancing. Although vaccines and practicing personal health protective behaviors are measures recommended by the government, the decision-making process for vaccination is complicated and potentially affected by a variety of factors such as trust in the government, historical influences, and religion [24, 25] . This study looks into the impact of risk perception on practicing personal health protective behavior and how it differs from its impact on vaccination acceptance. Therefore, the aims of this study are to (1) understand public acceptance of COVID-19 vaccines in Taiwan and influencing factors; (2) evaluate the association between risk perception and public acceptance of COVID-19 vaccines; and (3) evaluate the association between risk perception and personal health protective behaviors.",

Participants with a higher risk perception of COVID-19 adopted more non-invasive personal health protective behaviors, such as handwashing, mask wearing, and social distancing, but showed less willingness to receive a COVID-19 vaccine. One of the possible explanations of this phenomenon might be that partaking in non-invasive health protective behaviors only mildly inconveniences the user, unlike the potentially serious side effects of vaccination.

            "text": "This study had several limitations. First, due to the use of home telephone interviews from 6.00 p.m. to 10.00 p.m. on weekdays, our participants were mainly in the middle-aged group and above. Second, the investigation period was the month of October 2020, when there was less information regarding COVID-19 vaccines than there is now. However, the findings still reflect the need to develop an effective communication strategy for vaccine acceptance in Taiwan. Third, the relationships can only be considered to be associations rather than causal due to the nature of cross-sectional design; we might also not be able to rule out reporting bias due to the data collection method. Fourth, it should be noted that the low response rate in the telephone survey may cause sample bias and overestimation results, and acceptance of COVID-19 vaccines in the real world may be lower.",

Elderly participants, women, and those with higher education levels were less willing to receive a COVID-19 vaccine, and participants with a higher risk perception of COVID-19 adopted more non-invasive personal health protective behaviors, such as handwashing, mask wearing, and social distancing, but showed less willingness to receive a COVID-19 vaccine. We suggest that in-depth inquiries should be conducted regarding the considerations of specific ethnic groups who refuse to receive a COVID-19 vaccine, and risk communication strategies should be developed.
