Since it rapidly outpaced other SARS-CoV-2 strains in South Africa and quickly spread to other countries [2] , the World Health Organization (WHO) soon designated it as a variant of concern (VOC) and later named it Omicron [3] . It contains many more mutations than any previous VOCs; a total of 47 mutations in the whole genome, including 26 mutations in the spike (S) gene, and 13 mutations alone in the receptor-binding domain (RBD) in the S gene [4] . Moreover, five new mutations were found at both ACE2 and antibody binding sites, suggesting an increased immune escape capability [5] . Some studies indicate that the Omicron variant might have increased transmissibility, enhanced viral binding affinity and elevated antibody escape [1, 2, [6] [7] [8] .",

He received the SARS-CoV-2 Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine on April 7 and May 8, 2021, in Phoenix, Arizona, U.S.A. He left Phoenix for Victoria, British Columbia, Canada on September 11, and stayed there until November 25 when he left for China. He denied any close contacts with COVID-19 patients or people with symptoms. He arrived at Shanghai Pudong International Airport on November 27 and was immediately transported to a local hotel, where he was quarantined for 14 days in isolation. Oropharyngeal swabs were collected on day 1, 4, 7, and 14 (December 10) of the quarantine period and the PCR results were all negative for COVID-19 nucleic acid by qPCR. He left Shanghai for Guangzhou by airplane on December 11. An oropharyngeal swab was collected for the routine PCR test in the morning on December 12 after he arrived in Guangzhou. In the evening of December 12, he developed mild symptoms like fever, xerostomia, expectoration, and cough, with a body temperature of 37.7\u00b0C. The PCR test was positive of SARS-CoV-2 in the morning on December 13.",

The sequencing data were assembled from each sample and analysed using the Geneious package. Phylogenetic analysis of the whole genome sequence showed that three sequences were cluster together and closely related to one of the Omicron lineage BA.1 ( Figure 1A) . The genetic distance between them and BA.1 sequences is 0.01%. It is much less divergent than those between them and BA.2 sequences (0.11%) or B.1.1.529 sequences (0.07%). The Case 1 and Case 2 sequences were identical, while the Case 3 sequence different by one mutation that resulted in a P3395H mutation in ORF1a ( Figure 1B) . Two Omicron signature mutations (K417N in the S gene and D3G in the M gene) were not detected in all three sequences, while the P3395H mutation in the ORF1a gene was not found in Cases 1 and 2, but present in Case 3 ( Figure  1B ). The T333M mutation in the ORF1a gene was detected in all three sequences, but not found in currently known Omicron variant sequences. This unique new set of sequences explains the relatively long branch in the phylogenetic tree ( Figure 1A) , suggesting that all three cases are infected by a particular Omicron variant.",

Considering only two people being infected by this particular Omicron variant in China and the relative short time window during which Cases 2 and 3 were infected, the transmissibility of this particular Omicron variant in China might be underestimated and long-term monitoring is required.",

However, Case 2's granddaughter also lived together with Cases 2 and 3 but she remained negative for the infection up to date, suggesting some limiting factors for the transmissibility of the virus. Whether the Omicron variant presents any clinical differences in China will require more cases to study. It will also be important to understand how Cases 2 and 3 were infected while the granddaughter was not in the same environment. Taken together, the relatively long incubation time in Case 1 but short incubation time in Cases 2 and 3, mild symptoms, and the unique set of mutations will be important to follow up to better control the possible further spread of this new Omicron variant in China.",
