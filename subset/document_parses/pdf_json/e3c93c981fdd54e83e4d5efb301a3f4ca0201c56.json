The multiple antigen-presenting system, whereby proteins are genetically fused to rhizavidin and affinity linked to biotinylated templates, enables the generation of robust immune responses. The objective of this work was to express and purify the S. mansoni antigens, SmTSP-2 and SmCD59.2, in fusion with rhizavidin. The fusion with rhizavidin greatly decreased the expression level of rSmTSP-2, but not rSmCD59.2, and both were expressed in the insoluble fraction, requiring optimization of culture conditions. Evaluation of different E. coli strains and media showed that BL21-DE3 cultured in Terrific Broth provided the highest expression levels of both proteins. Investigation of a range of time and temperature of induction showed that E. coli strains expressing rRzv:SmTSP-2 and rRzv:SmCD59.2 showed the highest protein production at 23 \u00b0C for 15 h. Recombinant proteins were purified by a single step of affinity chromatography allowing isolation of these proteins in high concentration and purity. The optimization process increased final soluble protein yield of rRzv:SmTSP-2 by fourfold and rRzv:SmCD59.2 by tenfold, providing ~ 20 mg/L of each protein. Optimized fusion protein production will allow antigen use in biotin-rhizavidin affinity platforms.",

The proteins produced in this study will be incorporated into the novel antigen-presenting system, MAPS, to be evaluated as vaccine. Thus, two surface antigens were selected. SmTSP-2 is an integral membrane Tetraspanin (TSP) that plays a structural role in establishing and maintaining the integrity of the parasite's tegument membranes. In S. mansoni, TSPs act as \"support\" proteins, providing a structure of homo and heterodimers, forming complexes with other proteins, such as Anexina B30, Sm29, dysferlin, and calpain. These complexes are known as Tetraspanin-enriched microdomains (TEMs) involved in plasma membrane fusion and fission activities [16, 17] . SmCD59.2 is essential for the development of the schistosomule, the circulating larva during the first days of infection, being immunogenic at the stage of intense host-pathogen interaction [18] . Orthologs of this protein have recently been proposed as new vaccine targets for Fasciola hepatica and S. japonicum [18, 19] .",

Many of these systems require production of proteins in fusion with biotinbinding proteins, such as avidin or avidin derivatives. The recently developed MAPS delivery system requires higher yields of recombinant proteins in fusion with rhizavidin [3] . There are many challenges in the development of production systems for recombinant proteins in fusion with avidin derivatives or rhizavidin [6, 7] . The use of bacterial expression systems, such as E. coli, can lead to the accumulation of these proteins in inclusion bodies, requiring downstream treatments for renaturation to obtain the active proteins [25, 26] . Even with these treatments, the final yields are generally low, ~ 1-2 mg of pure protein per liter of culture [7, 26] . As for vaccine development purposes, obtaining soluble protein at the expression level is usually preferable, since refolding may have serious implications in antigen presentation, e.g., in the preservation of conformational epitopes; this will affect subsequent generation of appropriate immune responses in the host.",

A series of improvements were necessary to obtain a satisfactory amount of protein at the end of the production process. First, the improvements of protein expression were carried out linearly, adjusting one factor at a time, thus, defining the working strain and culture medium. It is essential to optimize the cultivation medium composition in order to achieve the highest possible density of production in E. coli [27] . The BL21 (DE3) strain cultured in TB medium provided higher yields of growth and soluble protein production. We have previously observed the same result for production of the Zika virus \u0394NS1 protein, a truncated form of NS1 [28] . The main difference of TB over 2YT or 2xHKSII is their buffering system, supporting a controlled pH during growth. The presence of glycerol as an extra carbon source also plays in important role in bacterial growth.",

The time of induction and temperature were varied in a series of experiments to optimize cell growth and product formation. It was possible to obtain a correlation between the time of induction, temperature, and the amount of product formed, establishing the optimal culture conditions to produce the proteins [25] . Initially, the rRzv:SmTSP-2 protein was expressed at OD 600 of ~ 3.0 and was mostly insoluble. Through these experiments, our best condition was 23 \u00b0C for 15 h; similar values were found for \u0394NS1 (induction at 21 \u00b0C for 20 h). In agreement, a consensus protocol for E. coli expression provided by a multicentric study that compared a variety of targets, conditions, and strains recommends the use of E. coli BL21 (DE3) strain cultured between 15-25 \u00b0C [31] . Although it is possible to further optimize protein production using mathematical modeling, e.g., response surface methodology (RSM) experiments, in both upstream and downstream processes [28, 32] , after optimization, this protein was purified from the soluble fraction at a concentration four times higher than the initial one. The rRzv:SmCD59.2 protein, after optimization was still directed to the insoluble fraction, but its recovery after refolding increased about tenfold. CD analysis confirmed the structural integrity of the purified protein. The optimized culture conditions provided ~ 20 mg/L of each protein.",

For our purposes, this purity is reasonable, since the proteins will still pass through the coupling stage to the biotinylated matrix, which will bind specifically through biotin-rhizavidin affinity to the biotin moiety. The complex will then be purified by gel filtration, which will separate them from the non-bound proteins, thus, guaranteeing elimination of possible contaminants. Since the fusion proteins contain a secretion signal that should direct them to the periplasmic space, a strategy that could further increase purity or solubility would be to purify the proteins only from the periplasmic fraction. However, this could reduce the total yields and an evaluation should be performed.",
