            "text": "The first EBP, performed with 2-3 ml of blood, was reported by Gormley [3] in 1960 after the observation that bloody taps were associated with reduced post-dural puncture headache (PDPH) [4, 5] . Since then, the technique of EBP has undergone substantial modifications. In 1980, Crawford Epidural blood patch (EBP) is the injection of autologous blood into the epidural space with the intent of sealing off a dural tear and stopping the leakage of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). EBP may cause an increase in intracranial pressure due to the mass effect of the injected blood volume, causing CSF from the spinal compartment to enter the intracranial compartment. EBP is usually considered in the management of moderate to severe headache (HA) attributed to low CSF pressure, such as post-dural puncture HA (PDPH), CSF fistula HA, and HA attributed to spontaneous intracranial hypotension (SIH) that does not respond to conservative management. However, prophylactic administration of EBP after accidental dural puncture can hardly be substantiated at present. EBP is generally safe but may rarely be associated with serious complications. Therefore, it should be carefully planned and performed under C-arm fluoroscopic guidance. Although many studies on PDPH and SIH have been conducted until recently, only few reviews have summarized the effectiveness of EBP from the perspective of a pain physician. This article reviews the current literature on the indication, contraindication, procedural consideration, post-procedural management, outcomes, and complications of EBP and the considerations for EBP in patients with COVID-19.",

The classical description of the spinal dura mater is that it is made up of collagen fibers running in a longitudinal direction. However, recent light and electron microscopic studies of human dura mater have contested this classical description [9] . These recent studies describe the dura mater as consisting of collagen fibers arranged in several layers parallel to the surface. Each layer consists of both collagen and elastic fibers that do not demonstrate spe-cific orientation. The outer or epidural surface may indeed have dural fibers arranged in a longitudinal direction, but this pattern is not repeated through successive dural layers. Recent measurements of dural thickness have also demonstrated that the posterior dura varies in thickness and that the thickness of the dura at a particular spinal level is not predictable within an individual or among individuals. Perforation in a thick area of dura may be less likely to lead to CSF leak than perforation in a thin area, and this may explain the unpredictable consequences of dural perforation [9] .",

            "text": "The choroid plexus secretes more than 75% of the CSF; the rest is secreted by the brain capillaries entering the ventricles via the ependyma [5] . The rate of CSF formation, in contrast to its volume, is fairly constant (0.35 ml per minute or approximately 500 ml per 24 h in adults) [5, [8] [9] [10] . CSF is absorbed by arachnoid villi into the cerebral venous sinuses and veins via a valve-like mechanism called bulk flow [5, 10] . A minor portion of the CSF is absorbed into the cerebral vessels by simple diffusion, and another small portion is likely absorbed via the lymphatics of the cribriform plate region into the nasal submucosa [10] . Old autopsy data estimated the total volume of CSF as approximately 150 ml [10] . In the horizontal position, CSF pressures at the lumbar, cisternal, and presumably intracranial or vertex levels are equal, measuring approximately 65-195 mmH 2 O [10, 11] . On assuming the erect position, the vertex pressure becomes negative, while the lumbar pressure increases to over 400 mmH 2 O [9, 11] . The relationship between CSF pressure and volume is exponential. Withdrawal of approximately 10% of CSF will decrease the already negative vertex pressure in the upright position by more than 40% [5, 10] . If a lumbar dural perforation is so large that CSF leak is greater than CSF production, the CSF pressure will drop. Orthostatic HA is thought to occur if more than 10% of the total CSF volume is lost [5, 9] . Evidence of CSF leakage on imaging \u2020 C.

First, the lowering of CSF pressure causes traction on the intracranial structures in the upright position. The pain-sensitive nature of these structures leads to the characteristic HA [5] . Second, the loss of CSF produces compensatory venodilatation vis-\u00e0-vis the Monro-Kellie doctrine [1, 5, 9, 11, 12] . The Monro-Kellie doctrine states that the sum of the volumes of the brain, CSF, and intracranial blood is constant. A decrease in CSF volume results in a compensatory increase in blood volume under conditions of unchanged intracranial volume [1, 5] . Dilation of the intracranial arteries and veins is a key pathogenetic link in the occurrence and development of HA [9, 12] . The beneficial effects of vasoconstrictor drugs, such as caffeine and theophylline, support this mechanism [7] .",

Studies have found that 90% of these HAs occur within 3 days of the procedure, and 66% start within the first 48 h [5, 9, 14] . A postural component may not be present in up to 5% of cases of PDPH [4, 5] . Furthermore, in one-third of cases, dural puncture may not have been recognized [4] . Although more than 90% of PDPHs are self-limiting and resolve spontaneously in 7 to 10 days [1, 14] , long-term complications of PDPH may include chronic HA, hypoacusis, diplopia, sinus thrombosis, and subdural hematoma [8, 15] . Moreover, in severe cases, it can cause cerebral herniation and even death if not treated promptly [1, 4, 5, 16, 17] .",

The diagnostic criteria for PDPH are listed in Table 2 . It is usually accompanied by neck stiffness and/or subjective hearing symptoms [18] . However, recent studies indicate that PDPH mostly occurs within 3 days after dural puncture [6] [7] [8] , and up to 29% of patients have HA as the only symptom [7] . It remits spontaneously or after sealing of the leak with autologous epidural lumbar patch [4, 5] . Rarely, the HA may last for months or even years [7, 18] . HA is the predominant, but not ubiquitous, presenting complaint. It is described as severe, \"searing and spreading like hot metal. \" The common distribution is over the frontal and occipital areas, radiating to the neck and shoulders [5, 18] . The pain is exacerbated by head movement and adoption of the upright posture and relieved by lying down [8] . An increase in severity of the HA on standing is the sine qua non of PDPH [9] . Cranial nerve (CN) involvement (vestibulocochlear nerve [CN8] involvement [manifesting as isolated tinnitus, hearing loss, and others] and abducens nerve [CN6] palsy [presenting as diplopia]) can also occur [1, 18] . Early administration of an EBP within 24 h of the onset of abducens nerve palsy may be associated with better outcome.",

Conversely, smaller needles produce smaller dural perforations with a lower incidence of HA [8, 9, 14] . However, fine-gauge spinal needles (29 G or smaller) are technically more difficult to use and, for spinal anesthesia at least, are associated with a high failure rate [9] . A balance must therefore be struck between the risks of PDPH and technical failure; hence, 25 G, 26 G, and 27 G needles probably represent the optimal needle size for spinal anesthesia [9] .

The Quincke type spinal needle is reported to be more associated with PDPH than the Whitacre, Sprotte, and Atraucan types [8, 9] . Nevertheless, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews about the needle tip gauge and tip designs for preventing PDPH reported that the use of traumatic needles was associated with a higher risk of PDPH than the use of atraumatic needles, although large and small gauges showed no significant difference in terms of the risk of PDPH regardless of whether a traumatic or atraumatic needle was used [8, 19] . ADP during epidural anesthesia is a more common cause of PDPH. During epidural needle placement, ADP occurs at a rate of 1.5%, and around 50% of these patients develop PDPH [5, 7] . It has been suggested that the incidence of ADP during epidural anesthesia is inversely related to surgeon experience [5] . However, sleep deprivation, surgeon fatigue, and the effect of night work may be the confounding variables producing the higher incidence of ADP in association with junior personnel performing epidural anesthesia [9] .",

However, no evidence has been found to suggest that routine bed rest after ADP is beneficial for preventing PDPH. Furthermore, bed rest has been found to likely increase the risk of PDPH compared with early ambulation [5] . There is also no evidence to support the benefit of prophylactic fluid supplementation [1, 5, 7] . Intravenous and parenteral caffeine can however reduce the pain temporarily [5] . Moderate to severe PDPH that has been refractory to conservative measure is a main indication for EBP. Factors that influence the decision to perform EBP are the severity of HA, response to medical treatment, degree of incapacitation by the HA, and nature of the patient's activity. Therapeutic EBP after epidural anesthesia should be delayed until after 24 h of trying conservative treatment because the high failure rate associated with early administration of EBP has been attributed to interference due to clot formation resulting from the use of local anesthetics [5] . If EBP is to be performed early, it would be better to delay it until the neuraxial blockade has regressed completely, to avoid unpredictable cephalad spread of the local anesthetics due to epidural pressure surge transmitted to the CSF compartment. EBP still remains the gold standard for treatment of PDPH, with complete relief of symptoms in 32% of cases and partial relief in 73% [5] .",

SIH results from non-iatrogenic CSF hypovolemia due to CSF leakage from the spinal canal, rather than CSF hypotension [23] [24] [25] [26] . The incidence has been estimated to be around 5/100,000 per year, peaking around the fourth or fifth decade of life and being slightly more common in women (female to male ratio, 3:2) [11, 23, [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] . However, mis-and under-diagnosis of the condition are common, and its actual incidence would be considerably greater [26, 27, 29] . Spontaneous CSF leak is considered a disorder with a variety of clinical manifestations and imaging features, sometimes quite different from what may be seen after dural puncture [10] .",

Approximately 10% of patients with SIH have normal brain imaging [24] [25] [26] . As the symptoms of SIH persist, there is a notable reduction in MRI findings: dural enhancement and HA symptoms were observed on an average for 15 weeks in one study [28] . Spinal imaging, such as MRI and CT or MR myelography, is an important part of the evaluation of SIH because demonstration of epidural leakage of CSF confirms the diagnosis, and may also direct treatment efforts. In studies for the definitive location of CSF leak on CT or MR myelography, the most common leak location was the thoracic spine (41%), followed by the cervicothoracic junction (25%), the cervical spine (14%), and the lumbar spine (12%) [26, 28] . Leaks were reported to be multiple in 24% of cases [26] . Radioisotope cisternography is less commonly used currently due to its relative invasiveness, poor spatial resolution, and limited sensitivity and specificity and advances in cross-sectional imaging techniques [24] . The definitive location of the leak may not be established in a significant number of cases investigated with the imaging techniques mentioned above [10] . CT myelography is considered to be the gold standard for the detection of spinal CSF leaks [24, 27] . However, because of its risk and invasiveness, brain and spine MRI with enhancement could be performed as first-line investigations in patients with clinical suspicion of SIH [26] . Brain MRI provides a view of the sequelae of a CSF leak and is helpful for initial diagnosis, whereas spinal MRI is used primarily to locate the source of the leak [29] .",

Medications, such as analgesics, corticosteroids, and theophylline, play only an adjunctive role in the management of SIH [27] . Moderate to severe HA associated with SIH syndrome that has been refractory to conservative measure is the main indication for EBP [10, 30] . In SIH, the success rate with each EBP varies from 30% to 90% [24, 28, 30] . The success rate in one report was 87.1% after the first targeted EBP and 52% after the first blind EBP [24, 27, 28] . Many patients require more than one EBP [28, 30] . A second or even third blood patch may be required at times but should alert the physician to review the differential diagnosis. The success rate of EBP for SIH is significantly less impressive than that seen in PDPH [10, 31] . This difference is a consequence of several factors, including the clarity of the level and site of the leak in PDPH and the often more complex anatomy of the leak in SIH.",

At 7-13 h, there is clot resolution, leaving a thick layer of mature clot over the dorsal part of the thecal sac. Animal studies have demonstrated that 7 days after the administration of an EBP, there is widespread fibroblastic activity and collagen formation [9] .

Studies have shown the mean spread of 15 ml of blood to be six spinal segments cephalad and three segments caudad with a mean volume per segment of 1.6 ml [4, 9] . Therefore, blood injected during an EBP preferentially spreads in the cephalad direction. For PDPH, the same interspace or one space lower is usually selected [4, 14] . EBP should be performed by an experienced pain physician with the administration of contrast agent under real-time fluoroscopy to monitor the spread of the injectate. The reasons for the injection of contrast under real-time fluoroscopy are to confirm that the needle tip is in the epidural space, to detect any intravascular injection, and to therefore predict the spread of the injectate (Fig. 1) . Fluoroscopy-guided targeted EBP should be employed if the primary origin of CSF leak has been determined [11, 23, 25, 27] . EBP via an upper thoracic route should be employed if the diagnostic im-aging techniques could not identify the primary origin of CSF leak in cases of SIH because the CSF leaks usually involve the cervicothoracic area. The technique for needle placement in targeted EBP is similar to that used for other epidural injections and most commonly involves either a transforaminal or an interlaminar approach [25] . Needle placement into target dorsal or ventral epidural space and potential spread of EBP are confirmed by contrast epidurogram [25] . Fluoroscopy-or CT-guided targeted transforaminal EBP would be helpful for sealing the ventral surface of the thecal sac, where dural tears caused by disk herniations usually occur in SIH [27] .",

EBP volume was a strong predictor of EBP efficacy in both univariate and multivariate analyses, with a volume of 20 ml being most associated with an effective EBP [14, 23] . Approximately 5 ml is recommended for EBP via the transforaminal approach [25] . The recommended rate of injection is approximately 5 ml/min [23] .

In one study, a smaller proportion of patients initially treated with targeted EBP required repeat EBP compared with those initially treated with blind EBP (21% and 61%, respectively) [30] . EBP is considered ineffective or inadequately performed if symptoms do not subside within 2 days of its administration [1] . The initial EBP is reported to be associated with a success rate of approximately 93% for inducing partial or complete relief of HA [5] . With complete relief as the tar-get, the success rate drops to around 75% only. The success rates of the first EBP are 95% for ADP with spinal needle and 30-75% for ADP with epidural needle in PDPH. A second EBP may be considered after other causes of HA have been excluded. If the first EBP produced some improvement in symptoms but the HA recurs, a second EBP can be considered. However, in cases where the first EBP has no effect or fails to relieve the symptoms, other causes of HA must be considered, and involvement of other specialties is recommended [4] . Approximately 30% of patients require a second EBP, following which 50% experience complete relief, 36-38% experience partial relief, and 12-14% experience no relief [4, 5, 18] .",

Most commonly, HAs associated with RIH are worse when lying down and may change in location, compared with SIH. They often occur in the frontal or periorbital region, while occipital HAs are typical for SIH. Symptoms may develop rapidly after EBP or over the course of days to weeks. Treatment is typically with acetazolamide or topiramate [27] . If symptoms are severe, therapeutic lumbar puncture may help relieve them immediately.

CSF leak causes caudad shift of the brain, which may lead to rupture of the fragile subdural bridging veins and bleeding into the subdural space. Minimizing CSF leak with an EBP may therefore reduce the incidence of cranial subdural hematoma [24] . Hypercoagulability in pregnancy increases the risk of thrombotic complications. Dural puncture may further increase the risk of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis due to both damage to the cerebral venous endothelium caused by a negative spinal-cranial pressure gradient and stasis from cerebral vasodilation [1] .",

Caffeine and theophylline are some of the most studied medications for relief of HA attributed to low CSF pressure. These medications act by two mechanisms. First, they interfere with calcium uptake by the sarcoplasmic reticulum, block phosphodiesterase, and antagonize adenosine, which all result in cerebral vasoconstriction. Second, they increase CSF production by stimulating sodium-potassium pumps [15] . Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), cosyntropin (an ACTH analogue), and hydrocortisone (which interacts with the ACTH axis) have also been proposed as a therapeutic option. The mechanism by which these medications treat HA attributed to low CSF pressure is unclear, although several theories exist, including expansion of blood volume by releasing aldosterone, dural edema causing overlap of dural hole, increase in CSF production through active sodium transport, and increase in brain \u03b2-endorphins [15] . Pharmacologic therapy with medications that are effective in treating other HA and pain syndromes has also been trialed. Sumatriptan, a serotonin type 1-d receptor agonist, commonly used in treating migraines, showed promise in early case series studies. Methylergonovine, a commonly used uterotonic agent, has also been used to treat migraines because of its alpha activity. Gabapentin and pregabalin have analgesic properties and can inhibit the sympathetic pathway of pain, which may contribute to the pain of HA attributed to low CSF pressure [15] .",

Dural stretching may activate the trigeminal nucleus caudalis, causing some of the pain from HA attributed to low CSF pressure, and this pathway may be blocked by GONB.

In such cases, it is appropriate to use crossmatched and tested blood, and the procedure should be conducted under aseptic conditions [17] .

            "text": "There have been recommendations from several medical societies to maximize the use of regional and neuraxial anesthesia for COVID-19 patients in the perioperative period. This is hypothesized to reduce the risk of aerosolization of viral particles, which is associated with the airway manipulation that occurs with general anesthesia. As a result, the use of neuraxial anesthesia for COVID-19 patients has increased over the past few months. Inevitably, a percentage of these patients may develop complications such as PDPH, requiring an EBP to manage their symptoms. A primary concern regarding the use of EBP in COVID-19 patients is the possibility of seeding the virus in the central nervous system (CNS). In general, an extremely low risk of transferring a blood-borne pathogen into the CNS has been reported when performing EBP with autologous blood for a patient with an ongoing infection. Another important concern is related to the known hypercoagulable state in COVID-19 patients and associated organ dysfunction that may alter the metabolism of anticoagulants [17] . These patients will often be treated with anticoagulants, such as unfractionated hepwww.anesth-pain-med.org arin, low-molecular weight heparin, or direct oral anticoagulants. Before performing EBP in this population, laboratory studies and the last dose of anticoagulant must be reviewed. The risks of suspending anticoagulation for an EBP should be carefully weighed against the risks associated with a hypercoagulable state, and it should be discussed with a hematologist [17] .",

If these fail, interventions other than EBP, including bilateral GONB or SPGB, could also be considered [17] . If severe and disabling PDPH persists despite conservative treatments and nerve blocks, EBP should be considered. A fluoroscopic approach may be preferable as it has been shown to be more precise and associated with a higher success rate than a blind technique [17] . The prone position may also offer greater distance for the care team from the patient's face and may be more comfortable for patients with COVID-19 and improve their respiratory mechanics. Complete personal protection for care personnel, including an N95 mask, a face shield, a gown, a head cover, and sterile gloves, must be utilized. The patient should remain masked throughout the procedure [17] .",

Prophylactic administration of EBP after ADP can hardly be substantiated at present. Before EBP, diagnostic testing, such as brain and spine MRI with enhancement, is essential for both establishing the diagnosis and localizing CSF leaks. EBP is generally safe but may rarely be associated with serious complications. Therefore, strict asepsis should be employed for both blood collection and epidural puncture. Moreover, EBP should be performed in the prone position under C-arm fluoroscopic guidance. Complete personal protection for care personnel, including an N95 mask, a face shield, a gown, a head cover, and sterile gloves, must be utilized when performing EBP in COVID-19 patients. Further investigation, including a large qualified trial on EBP, is warranted, and careful attention should be paid to the timing, prophylactic use, and injection volume and speed of EBP until substantial evidence is available.",
