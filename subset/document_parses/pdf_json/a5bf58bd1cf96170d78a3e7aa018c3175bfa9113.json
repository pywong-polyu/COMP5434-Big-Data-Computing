            "text": "Despite the extensive use of telemedical applications in healthcare, many dentists are unfortunately ignorant of the nature of teledentistry, the benefits behind its use, or its adaption/ application in routine practice. [9] Several studies focused on the perception of healthcare providers towards teletechnology in the provision of healthcare to patients. A study by Palmer et al. has investigated the awareness of orthodontists on the use of digital and electronic technology, where close to 70% of the respondents agreed with the use of teletechnology and only as few as 36% reported worrying about security and privacy issues. [10] In another study by Wood et al., they explored the demands for the use of teledentistry by general dentists and oral and maxillofacial surgeons where they concluded that teledentistry could be an essential step to address issues regarding patient access to care or healthcare cost. [11] Estai et al. assessed the perception of Australian dentists on the use of teledentistry. They stated that most dentists (80%) reported positivity regarding teledentistry and the benefits gained from implementing the technology. [12] In another study, Mandall et al. stated that up to 71% of orthodontists agreed that teledentistry would be highly beneficial for patients' referrals and half of the participants felt it would reduce the treatment time needed. [13] The perception from the patient's aspect was explored by Donelan et al., who found that more than 60% of patients reported no difference in the overall quality of the visit between virtual and conventional face-to-face. They also stated that patient convenience was enhanced by using telemedicine for follow-up and care. [14] In Saudi Arabia, more studies have been published regarding telemedicine applications in the medical field than in dentistry. AlShaya et al. investigated the use of mobile-phones for patient diagnosis and treatment planning among children, where they found that teledentistry could be a reliable tool for the initial diagnosis of caries. [7] AlKlayb et al. developed a mobilephone application to investigate the effectiveness of teledentistry to educate mothers. In their study, the application significantly improved mothers' knowledge of their children's' oral health needs. [9] Albarrak et al. assessed physicians' knowledge, perception, and attitude toward the implementation of telemedicine in clinical practice. They stated that the majority of physicians have low knowledge of telemedicine and its benefits. There were barriers mentioned by the participating physicians, mostly privacy, cost, technology, as well as lack of training. [15] There is a limited amount of literature addressing the attitudes and awareness of dental professionals towards teledentistry and its use in healthcare provision. Therefore, this survey was aimed to assess Saudi Arabian dental professionals' perceptions towards teledentistry and its usefulness for the dental practice.",

The questionnaire was adapted from a similar study by Estai et al. That study was initially developed to evaluate Australian dental practitioners' perceptions of teledentistry's usefulness and its role in improving dental practice and patient outcomes. [12, 16] The first part of the questionnaire covered professional and demographic information as well as communication methods preference. The second part of the questionnaire was based on five-point Likert-type questions consisting of 26 questions, which were divided into four categories: data security concerns by the dental professionals, teledentistry and practice improvement, the usefulness of teledentistry for dental practice as well as its usefulness for dental patients. The questionnaire was pretested to a group of 20 general dentists before distribution to obtain feedback, and overall acceptability of the questionnaire and minimal corrections were made based on their response. Since this was a questionnaire-based study, an exemption was granted for this study by the Ethical Committee of the College of Dentistry, Imam Abdulrahman Bin Faisal University.",

            "text": "In agreement with previous studies, there was considerable uncertainty about the possibility of teledentistry to help in providing accurate diagnosis compared to the clinical setting. [5, 7, [17] [18] [19] Other studies stated a promising diagnostic accuracy when diagnosing caries or oral pathology. [17, 20] This was achieved after proper training where training sessions were conducted for proper diagnosis by practicing dentists. Thus, teledentistry can produce acceptable diagnosis with proper training following a set protocol. Over half of the respondents indicated that teledentistry would necessitate an extra appointment to take photographs, this reflects the understanding of the need for proper photographs taken by trained personnel. [12] The highest concern (80%) reported was the concern about patient confidentiality when data are shared online, the ability to share health information via the internet is always a concern for patients and health professionals over who can view the information or have access to and this concern agrees with previously published literature. [18, 21, 22] However, the majority of the respondents agreed that teledentistry would be effective in reducing the waiting list, which is believed to be due to the effect of teledentistry on the referral process. Teledentistry can improve guidelines and peer communication; patients will be assigned to a dental specialty clinic based on an informed decision considering patients' condition and needs. Patients management and referral process are some of the main drivers to impellent tele-technology in dental practice. [23] [24] [25] [26] Participants showed high agreement concerning the benefits the practice will gain when implementing teledentistry; they believed it would be advantageous in training and educating the practice personnel. Distance learning gave the dental personnel the chance to target the information needed at a time of their convenience, thus improving their skills and knowledge. [27] [28] [29] Respondents agreed with the statement that teledentistry could improve the practice by saving referral time and reducing the cost compared to conventional methods. Reduced cost and efficient time management can attract patients and gain their trust; published literature stated that tele-dental patient assessments were the lowest cost service model compared to conventional real-time consultation. [18, 30, 31] The majority of the respondents (<60%) agreed/agreed strongly that dental insurance plans should cover teledentistry cost, which can be another factor that attracts patients. Many countries have included teleconsultation and tele-practice into the health insurance plans. [32] [33] [34] Participants showed high concerns relating to security, technical issues, digital forgery (76%), hardware incompatibility (78%), and equipment reliability (75%). To have the latest teledental technologies is not enough without the proper design of infrastructure. The solution must consider software/hardware compatibilities to ensure full secure integration between the different technical components. The right setup will reduce both the implementation and operation costs and errors. [10, [33] [34] [35] [36] It was expected that the age, work location, or working hours would influence the participants' opinion; in this study, those demographic factors did not affect the uses of teledentistry. Previous studies have shown that practitioners who work in remote areas or private clinics are more accepting of the tele-technology and its benefits. [11, [37] [38] [39] [40] Other studies showed that those who work overtime would be keen to adopt tele-technology to reduce the working load. [41] The participants' qualifications and working experience were significantly affecting this study's results. In our study, general dentists scored lower than others; general dentists can demonstrate some resistance toward unfamiliar technology either due to lack of experience or misunderstanding the concept. Other published studies showed the excitement and the benefits gained by general dentists through tele-dental application; they were able to learn and sometimes perform more advanced procedures through tele-supervision. [11, 18, 42] Dentists with working experience of 11 to 15 years showed the lowest score, which is the middle age group, they are still in the process of navigating their way into building their career and might be resistant to the technology not to lose their patients pool.",

Another limitation can be the use of the 5-point Likert scale; respondents tend to select the middle choices away from the edges rather than being sharply definite with their response. [48, 49] This survey reflects a positive perception and attitude toward teledentistry as a general concept, specific investigation targeting specific aspects such as the use of social-media in dentistry, patient screening, diagnosis, referral, or other implementation is needed. The results reflect the perspective of dental professionals, the readiness and willingness of the stakeholders in this case \"the patients\" is needed. The next rational step would be to investigate the knowledge and perception for specific selected applications of teledentistry then adopt a business model to implement the collected data and gather further information on the stakeholders' perception, acceptance, and rising challenges to address.",
