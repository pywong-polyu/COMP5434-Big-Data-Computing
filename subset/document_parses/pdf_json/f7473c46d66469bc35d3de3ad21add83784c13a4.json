In recent times, the recycling of MSW has drawn attention as the process can add value through resources from the recovered waste materials and facilitates the process of circular economy. However, during the unprecedented coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak, the risk of infection with the highly contagious virus has proven detrimental to the continuation of MSW as a valuable resource. The volume of waste, especially household waste, is higher; face masks, PPE (personal protective equipment), and hazardous materials such as batteries and empty chlorine bottles are examples of extra waste that have arisen during the pandemic. Various countries have set up initiatives for MSW management, including safety measurements for employees in the MSW management sector. The use of disinfectant prior to sorting waste, as well as storing waste for 9 days, may help to inactivate the COVID-19 virus, ensuring an appropriate safety level for MSW management. This work aimed at studying different MSW management strategies, specific challenges, and possible solutions for better understanding for those involved in waste management, in addition to providing a possible management strategy during and post-COVID-19 pandemic.",

However, municipal solid waste (MSW) management remains an environmental concern and one of the major constraints for green growth across the globe (Iqbal et al. 2020) . MSW includes waste generated in households within a community under a municipality and waste generated from industrial or commercial sectors. The trend indicates that the amount of MSW is predicated to increase globally by 2.3 billion tonnes by 2025 (Hoornweg and Bhada-Tata 2012) and 3.4 billion tonnes by 2050 (Kaza et al. 2018) . Estimates show that cooperative economic organizations and developed countries are responsible for the generation of half of the total MSW produced globally . The organic content of global MSW is 46% but rises to 64% in developing countries (Foundation 2017; Lu et al. 2020) . Landfill remains the most economical method of disposal worldwide (Renou et al. 2008) ; 70% of MSW is disposed of as landfill and 19% is recovered for recycling and composting (Abylkhani et al. 2020) . Recycling and other alternative uses, i.e., energy and compost, constitute appropriate practices for MSW management, with the potential to achieve a greener economy that encompasses sustainable development. A proper method for sorting and disposal of MSW may be the main goal of MSW waste management.",

In recent years, the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the subsequent global COVID-19 pandemic have necessitated scrutiny of the MSW management practices and approaches in various countries. MSW management requires effective participation, coordination, and concerted efforts toward efficient delivery among various interconnected bodies, as it involves waste generation, waste composition, collection, recycling, pre-treatment and treatment, and finally disposal. These management aspects differ in terms of the legal, economic, governmental, political, administrative, and environmental players in different countries. Management structure and function can be country-specific, demand-driven, or necessity-oriented and rely on socioeconomic, behavioral, cultural, institutional, and political frameworks. Therefore, MSW management involves multi-professional drivers, and at times, the failure of one component can lead to the collapse of the whole management strategy (Pharino 2017) .",

The causative virus has been reported to persist on different surfaces for periods ranging from 3 hours to 9 days (Kampf et al. 2020; van Doremalen et al. 2020; Wang et al. 2005) . The transmission of COVID-19 virus occurs through contact and the respiratory system, and the main sources of respiratory droplets are coughing and sneezing by an infected person (WHO 2019). The long persistence of this virus on inert surfaces and humanto-human transmission ) has resulted in the rapid spread of COVID-19 virus. Thus, there is a possibility of workers in the MSW management sector being infected with COVID-19 virus and thus contributing to community transmission, since they are directly exposed to contaminated waste generated from infected people. This has necessitated the installation of appropriate protection measures for workers during the COVID-19 pandemic, as waste pickers, doctors, and nurses have all been key workers throughout this period (covid-19-Jordan 2020) . Different countries have adopted different initiatives to address this issue through training, policy, and monitoring practices (covid-19-Jordan 2020; covid-19-Lebanon 2020), but the major risk factors have yet to be appropriately overcome at a global level. Effective management of MSW during the COVID-19 pandemic can contribute to circular economy, since it will allow for recycling and conversion to valuable purposes, i.e., energy, rather than landfill.",

Therefore, transmission of the COVID-19 virus can occur through generation of MSW and its subsequent management. A brief description of the general composition of MSW and the transmission mechanics of the COVID-19 virus through the surfaces of MSW are presented in this section.",

            "text": "During this pandemic, it has been possible for the amount and type of waste generation to increase or decrease depending on the location (Naughton 2020). The reasons are twofold; on the one hand, major businesses and schools, which usually generate large volumes of waste, have remained closed for a certain period. On the other hand, for the businesses that remain open, household, medical, and agricultural waste generation has increased substantially. It has been observed that the amount of MSW has increased by 3.3% and organic waste by 13.3% within a year in New York City alone (Staub 2020) . However, in Hubei Province, China, the amount of MSW in large-and mediumsized cities has reduced by 30%, but the generation of medical waste (infectious and non-infectious) has increased by more than 370% . More than 80% of total healthcare waste is non-infectious and needs to be collected and disposed as MSW (WHO 2020a, b, c, d) . Thus, the composition of MSW is heterogeneous. The general overview of this MSW composition, including waste that has been newly added during the COVID-19 pandemic, is presented in Table 1 . The composition of MSW generated from different sources has remained similar during the pandemic. However, the quantity and components of waste may vary. It has been observed that the composition of MSW is dynamic; within each community, it is influenced by several factors such as income level, lifestyle, season, household type, level of affluence, and location. In general, developing countries and rural areas generate more organic waste, i.e., food waste . In contrast, a larger amount of metals, plastics, and glass are generated from high-income households because of their consumption of processed foods and different commodities. Overall food waste during the COVID-19 pandemic has increased by 12% (Aldaco et al. 2020) .",

Cardboard is categorized into packaging, non-packaging, laminated with aluminum, laminated without aluminum, and stiff cardboard materials (Bernache-Perez et al. 2001; Lombardi et al. 2010) . Card is subdivided into liquid cartons and card (i.e., greetings cards, invitation cards, and card such as clothing and luggage tags) (Pan and Voulvoulis 2007) . Beverage cartons, corrugated boxes, and folding boxes fall under the category of board. Regular paper includes books, booklets, journals, phonebooks, office paper (Edjabou et al. 2018; Miezah et al. 2015) , wrapping paper, photographic paper (Lombardi et al. 2010) , newsprint, high-grade paper, corrugated paper (Aja and Al-Kayiem 2014; Lombardi et al. 2010) , newspaper (Edjabou et al. 2018; Lombardi et al. 2010; Miezah et al. 2015; Pan and Voulvoulis 2007; Zorpas et al. 2015) , magazines (Edjabou et al. 2018; Pan and Voulvoulis 2007; Zorpas et al. 2015) , and advertisement leaflets and posters (Edjabou et al. 2018 , Zorpas et al. 2015 . Other paper includes toilet paper (Zorpas et al. 2015) , feminine hygiene pads (Bernache-Perez et al. 2001) , tissue paper (Miezah et al. 2015) , kitchen tissues/towels (Zorpas et al. 2015) , and miscellaneous papers (Aja and Al-Kayiem 2014; Edjabou et al. 2018; Pan and Voulvoulis 2007) . Packaging waste, especially paper-based material, has increased substantially due to spikes in online shopping, as many countries have adopted lockdown measures that have shut down over-the-counter and physical shopping during the COVID-19 pandemic (covid-19-Austria 2020). Plastic waste comes in different forms, i.e., packaging and film (Aja and Al-Kayiem 2014; Sahimaa et al. 2015; Zorpas et al. 2015) . Packaging plastics include garbage bags, packaging materials, high-density polyethylene (HDPE), low-density polyethylene (LDPE), polyethylene terephthalate (PET), and other plastics (Aja and Al-Kayiem 2014; Edjabou et al. 2018; Lombardi et al. 2010; Sahimaa et al. 2015; Zorpas et al. 2015) . Plastic film is categorized into the forms of pure and composite plastics used for wrapping (Edjabou et al. 2018) . Plastic bottles are also considered plastic waste (Zorpas et al. 2015) . These include empty containers for cooking oil, soft drinks, honey, and water. The aforementioned sharp increase in online shopping due to COVID-19 has also significantly contributed to the generation of a large volume of waste from plastic packaging material (covid-19-Austria 2020).",

The information regarding the survival rates of the COVID-19 virus on different substrates is crucial for devising an effective management approach for MSW. Researchers have determined that the survival rate ranges from a few hours to a few days based on the type of substrate (Kampf et al. 2020; van Doremalen et al. 2020; Wang et al. 2005) . The survival rate of the virus postaerosolization on copper material, cardboard, plastic, and stainless steel are 3 h, 4 h, 24 h, and 2-3 days, respectively (van Doremalen et al. 2020). Other researchers have reported that it can remain on inanimate surfaces such as metal, glass, and plastic for up to 9 days (Kampf et al. 2020) . Other types of coronaviruses are reported to persist in dechlorinated tap water and hospital wastewater at 20\u00b0C for 2 days (Wang et al. 2005) . The long survival rate of COVID-19 virus on substrate may cause a higher spread of the virus due to the frequent use of these materials and generation of waste in daily life. The possible transmission of the COVID-19 virus through waste is presented in Fig. 1 . However, the persistence of the COVID-19 virus and its survival rate on other surfaces such as wood, cloth, etc. are yet to be determined; this information would help to devise an effective management approach for MSW.

In India, around 60% of plastic is recycled (Alpizar et al. 2020) ; however, the pandemic has decreased the recycling of plastic in countries with smaller economies, and increased local burning strategies as an attempt to avoid virus contagion (Corburn et al. 2020) . Though deploying mobile incineration facilities, countries with larger economies can overcome the negative effects of COVID-19 on plastic waste management. Compost and incineration as an MSW management strategy can reduce the burden of landfill (Abu Hajar et al. 2020) . Incineration is the main system for MSW treatment in China (Chen et al. 2010; Lin et al. 2020) . Though the COVID-19 pandemic has sometimes rendered MSW management difficulty and troublesome due to the increased risk of community transmission, an integrated MSW management strategy with appropriate treatment technology and containment could provide a sustainable and environmentally friendly option (Staub 2020) .",

Therefore, within a city's administrative structure, management of MSW draws the largest single budget from government and constitutes one of the largest employers within the city. In addition, collection of solid waste inevitably falls within the realm of local government. A city without effective waste management is rarely considered to be capable of managing more complex public services such as health, education, and transportation. Poor management of waste puts a huge strain on health, local and global environment, and the economy, because management without appropriate measures brings about additional expenses, increases suffering within a neighborhood, and deteriorates quality of life. In addition, as MSW is generated worldwide, improper management significantly contributes to global environmental problems through generation of greenhouse gases, e.g., methane, and public health issues. Therefore, due to the global nature of waste generation, governance should essentially include the aspects relating to an increased global product supply chain, urbanization practices, and opportunities for the recycling industry (Vallero 2019) .",

A communication gap may break down the chain of custody for MSW management strategies, whether during the COVID-19 pandemic or at other times. Smooth MSW management is made possible through proper communication among the waste generator, collector, treater, disposer, and recycler. However, developing countries often suffer from poor communication among these actors; the pandemic has interrupted this communication even further (Sinha et al. 2020) . It has become imperative that documentation be faster during this crisis, which has entailed the necessity of online communication, meaning the use of soft copies (through email and other interactive platforms) rather than hard copies. Clear instruction about collection, disinfection, and disposal places, i.e., recycling, combustion, and landfill, should be available on web-based platforms. This can help to manage waste without any unnecessary prohibition during the pandemic. In addition, engaging with the community can play a pivotal role in effective and safe MSW management by reducing waste generation and allowing safe disposal of waste (Falcone et al. 2020) .",

The extent to which the COVID-19 virus is present in wastewater is poorly understood, and its presence in an infectious form is yet to be determined (Kataki et al. 2021) . Most previous reports on virus-related research in the biosolids field have focused on enteroviruses. Work by Gundy et al. (2009) showed that SARS-CoV-1, a relative of the COVID-19 virus, displays less environmental persistence in primary and secondary effluent compared to poliovirus. For sewage sludge, treatment by anaerobic or aerobic digestion and/or dewatering can reduce the numerical population of disease-causing agents, such as the COVID-19 virus, in biosolids. These treated biosolids can be used for the valuable purpose through hydrothermal liquefaction.",

As we gradually attain a better understanding of the economic ramifications of the COVID-19 pandemic, the ways in which a circular model can contribute to the overall resource management system and recycling are slowly being unveiled (Ibn-Mohammed et al. 2021) . The Investor Agenda group urges local governments to avoid the prioritization of risky, short-term emissions-intensive projects and instead focus on long-term low carbon alternatives in resource management and circularization of post-disaster recovery. The importance of these strategies has notably been highlighted in the USA, where several state treasurers have urged ventilator makers to make service manuals and repair-related resources available to help hospitals deal with the crisis. Similar integrated approaches could allow the use of COVID-19-associated overproduced and linear goods in a circular model incorporating public health, medical technology, engineering, and waste management (Bl\u00e9rio 2020; Foundation 2017) .",

With traditional supply chain systems leaving open ends in terms of accumulating waste in both farms and households, closed circular food waste recycling can provide better alternatives (Giudice et al. 2020) . Closed circular and regenerative practices can reduce the load of biodegradable and chemical wastes on management systems, meaning that more resources can be allocated to handling medical waste. As the Ellen MacArthur Foundation's research has highlighted, a circular scenario could lead to a 50% reduction in pesticide and synthetic fertilizer use by 2030 in Europe compared to 2012 levels (Bl\u00e9rio 2020) . Finally, regenerative agriculture is also a powerful force in the climate crisis mitigation arsenal, as circular economy strategies could reduce emissions by 5.6 billion tonnes of CO 2 , corresponding to a 49% reduction in the projected total food system waste for 2050 (Foundation 2017).",
