Furthermore, self-report measures could convey a further systematic bias. The overall response rate was relatively low, limiting results generalizability. However, the response rate was similar to other surveys in literature [45, 46] . Another important limitation is its cross-sectional nature because of the impossibility of assessing the temporal relationship between exposure and outcome. Lastly, although the two groups had a different composition (only medical doctors in primary care staff ) and hence not fully comparable, a recent survey with 2166 respondents showed that nurses and medical doctors suffered from equal anxiety symptoms severity [37] .",
