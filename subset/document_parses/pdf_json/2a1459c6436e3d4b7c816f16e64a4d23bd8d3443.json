Therefore, we sought to investigate the antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 following natural infection and following a single dose of AZD2221, in Sri Lankan individuals. Methods: Using Luminex assays, we characterized the IgG and IgA responses in patients with varying severity of illness and following a single dose of the vaccine at 4 weeks and 12 weeks since onset of illness or following vaccination. Haemagglutination test (HAT) was used to assess the antibodies to the receptor binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 wild type (WT), B.1.1.7, B.1.351 and B.1.617.2 (VOCs) and surrogate neutralizing test to measure ACE2 receptor blocking antibodies.",

Emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern such as the B.1. 1.7 (alpha) and more recently B.1.617.2 (delta) has led to exponential increase of the number of COVID-19 cases and deaths in many countries [1] [2] [3] . While the higher income countries have vaccinated a large proportion of their population, resulting in lower hospitalizations and deaths, many lower income and lower-middle income countries are grappling with the increase in the case loads, overburdening of health care resources and the inability to secure adequate doses of COVID-19 vaccines 4 .",

At 4 weeks and 12 weeks of illness, individuals with both mild and moderate/severe illness, had the highest levels of IgA antibodies to the RBD ( Figure 1C and 1D) . However, those with moderate/severe disease had significantly higher antibody responses to all four proteins when compared to those with mild illness at 4 weeks, but there was no difference at 12 weeks (table 1) . Unlike what was observed with SARS-CoV-2 S2 specific IgG responses, those with mild illness had significantly higher IgA responses (p=0.02) but not to N protein (p=0.18) ( Figure 2A ). As expected, vaccinees had low responses to the N protein, with IgA levels similar to those seen in controls except for IgA to S1, which was higher in the vaccinees (p=0.003). Significant differences of IgA responses were seen in those with mild illness, moderate/severe illness and vaccinees for S1 (p=0.001), S2 (p=0.0003), RBD (p=0.0003) and N protein (p=0.04) ( Figure 1C ).",

Based on the Luminex assays, IgG and IgA levels to S1, S2, RBD and N, had increased from 4 weeks to 12 weeks in those with mild illness and in the vaccinees, although the increase was only significant in the vaccinees. In the vaccinees, the most significant rise was seen for the S2 subunit, while in those with mild illness the rise was seen for IgG antibodies for the RBD. In those with moderate/severe illness, while there was no change in the IgG responses from 4 to 12 weeks, responses to the N protein had increased although this was not significant. Therefore, the kinetics of antibody responses to S1, S2, RBD and N appears to vary based on the severity of natural infection and also appeared to be different in vaccinees. Interestingly, blood samples of those who had a febrile illness in 2017 and 2018 also showed IgG and IgA responses to the S2 subunit, suggesting the presence of S2 subunit cross-reactive antibodies, in these donors as previously seen in other studies 13, 14 . Following a single dose of the AZD2221 vaccine, the antibodies against S2 appears to continue to rise from 4 to 12 weeks, possibly due to stimulation of pre-existing cross-reactive memory B cell responses to the S2 subunit 14 .",

In this study, we proceeded to investigate the differences in the antibody responses to the RBD in those with natural infection at 4-and 12weeks following infection, and after a single dose of the AZD1222 vaccine. The antibody responses to the WT, B.1.1.7, B.1.351 and B.1.617.2 were measured. In those with mild illness, at 4 weeks from onset of illness the median antibody titre to the WT was 160 (IQR 80 to 320), B.1.1.7 was 120 (IQR 70 to 320), B.1.351 was 10 (IQR, 0 to 80) and for B.1.617.2 it was 40 (IQR 20 to 80). At 12 weeks following the onset of illness, although there was a slight reduction in the antibody titres to the WT (p=0.91) and B.1.617.2 (0.61), this was not statistically significant (Figure 3A). In those with moderate/severe illness at 4 weeks from onset of illness the median antibody titre to the WT was 1280 (IQR 160 to 1280), B.1.1.7 was 640 (IQR 160 to 1280), B.1.351 was 40 (IQR, 0 to 160) and for B.1.617.2 it was 320 (IQR 80 to 1280) (Figure 3B). There was no significant difference between the antibody titres for the WT compared to B.1.1.7 (p=0.12), but clearly differed for B.1.315 (p<0.0001) and B.1.617.2 (p=0.004). Although the antibody titres for the WT and all the variants reduced from 4 to 12",

From 4 to 12 weeks, although there was no significance difference of the antibody titres of the RBD of the WT (p=0.05), B.1.351 (p=0.54) and B.617.2 (p=0.07), the antibody titres to B.1.1.7 significantly reduced (p=0.02) (Figure 3B). As previously described by us at 4 weeks following vaccination, the HAT titres were significantly lower to the B.1.1.7 (p=0.007), B.1.351 (<0.0001) and for B.1.617.2 (p<0.0001). However, there was no significance difference in antibody titres between B.1.351 and B.1.617.2 (p=0.43).

However, by 12 weeks the antibody levels to both B.1.351 and B.1.617.2 were similar.

The antibody levels among vaccinees were similar to B.1.351 and B.1.617.2, showing equal reduction compared to antibody binding to the RBD of the WT. Following vaccination, these levels further declined at 12 weeks to VOCs but not to the WT, showing that a single dose of the AZD2221 was likely to offer less protection against VOCs. In fact, it has been shown that one dose of AZD2221 is only 33% effective in preventing symptomatic disease with B.1.617.2, 3 weeks following the first dose 29 . The efficacy of a single dose against B.1.617.2 is likely to decline further by 12 weeks, as the antibodies to RBD further waned. However, the efficacy of two doses of AZD2221 against hospitalization has been shown to be 92%, while for Pfizer-BioNTech was 96% 30 .
