Why was he so willing and swift to greenlight a project that would divert water from his home province to benefit the people in a neighbor province? We explored this question through a bipartite investigation. First, we dug into the empirical literature, the literature based on experience and/or observation, in search of his motivations for the action. Second, for a more systematic, deeper understanding, we examined the instance via a lens of compassion practice, an eclectic collection of theoretical constructs on compassion practice through which one can examine an individual's behavior and performance for new insights. This article reports the second part of our research. It is a sequel to Why was Tao Lujia so willing and swift to greenlight the Red Flag Canal Project in 1960? The instance and his motivations which reports the first part of our research and is also published in this journal. Both articles are part of the SEPR mini-series on the Red Flag Canal, one of the best kept secrets in the world history of socio-ecological practice.",

It includes six distinct yet intertwining classes of human action and social process-planning, design, construction, restoration, conservation, and management (Xiang 2019, p. 7). 2 [1] In the 2009 Encyclopedia of positive psychology, American psychologist Sherlyn Jimenez provides a useful comparison of compassion with related yet distinct constructs of altruism, compassionate love, empathy, pity, and sympathy (Jimenez 2009, pp. 210-211) . In addition to an affective and motivational state, some psychologists also consider compassion to be a trait, a \"general style[s] of emotional responses that persist(s) across context and time.\" (Goetz et al. 2010, p. 353 Strauss et al.

This is best presented in a famous aphorism by the Dalai Lama, \"If you want others to be happy practice compassion; if you want to be happy practice compassion.\" (The Dalai Lama 2009, p. x) How can such a mutual benefit be even possible, given compassion practitioner's focus on others' well-being, as presented above in Sect. 2.1? The secret, according to the Dalai Lama, is that one's compassion practice (for the wellbeing of others') and self-compassion practice (for the compassion practitioner's own welfare) are in fact two distinct yet intertwined aspects of a same process. 5 \"In discussing the definition of compassion, the Tibetan word Tse-wa, there is also a sense to the word of its being a state of mind that can include a wish for good things (i.e., well-being) for oneself (i.e., the compassion practitioner). In developing compassion, perhaps one could begin with the wish that oneself be free of suffering, and then take that natural feeling towards oneself and cultivate it, enhance it, and extend it out to include and embrace others.\" (The Dalai lama 2009, p. 114; parentheses by the authors) As such, the more one practices compassion for others' well-being, the more one provides self-compassion for one's own happiness (Shonin et al. 2015 (Shonin et al. , p. 1161 The Dalai Lama 1999, p. 127) .",

Integral to such a sense of mutual relatedness or \"we-ness\" (Jimenez 2009, p. 212 ) is practitioner's discernment that there is no real difference between herself/himself and all others in terms of suffering and need for compassion: no sentient being is exempt from suffering, suffering is a shared human experience; everyone deserves compassion, including oneself (Arendt 1963 (Arendt /1990 Jimenez 2009, p. 212; Strauss et al. 2016, p. 17 ; also the quotes of the Dalai Lama in Sects. 2.1 and 2.2). As such, his/her \"own liberation (from suffering) is not distinct from the liberation of all beings.\" (Silk 2017, p. 2 ; parenthesis by the authors). Personal suffering experience is a direct source for the genuine sense of interconnectedness. It comes in two forms. One is a practitioner's self-suffering experience that is similar to, or even in common with, the one the potential compassion recipient is experiencing (for example, hardships of water shortage, loss of loved ones, or sickness) [Arendt 1963 [Arendt /1990 Bernhardt and Singer 2012, p. 1, p. 4; Jimenez 2009, pp. 212-214;  The Dalai Lama cited in Barad (2007, p. 14) ]. The other, relatively rare but arguably more powerful, is a practitioner's past or present co-suffering experience together, or \"in the flesh\", with the present sufferer (Arendt 1963 (Arendt /1990 Frost 2014, p. 51 ).",

Such a designation conforms with the literal meaning of compassion according to its origin-etymologically, the English word compassion is from Latin compat\u012b, standing for \"suffer with\" (Barad 2007, p. 12; Collins English Dictionary 2020a). Compassion practice of this authentic kind is a \"magic\", writes German-American philosopher Hannah Arendt in her 1963 book On revolution (Arendt 1963 (Arendt /1990 , in that it opens the heart of a practitioner to the suffering of others', and establishes and confirms a \"natural bond\"-interconnectedness-between the practitioner and recipient (Ibid.) to the extent that \"it is easier (for the practitioner) to suffer (herself/himself) than to see others suffer.\" (Ibid., p. 86; parentheses by the authors) Without such a genuine sense of interconnectedness, argues Scottish philosopher and political economist Adam Smith (1723-1790) in his 1759 book The theory of mental sentiments with a hypothetical yet cogent example (Smith 1759 (Smith /2002 , a person's compassion practice is most likely confined to a sheer vicarious, imaginative participation in the suffering of others'; and such a participation at best leads to empathy, a humane sentiment the Dalai Lama describes as compassion \"at a basic level\" (The Dalai Lama 1999, p. 123).",

A servant-leader, he points out, \"always empathizes\", strives \"to bring more compassion into the lives of people (he/she serves)\" (Ibid., p. 21, p. 29; parenthesis by the authors), and makes sure people's highest-priority needs are served (Ibid., p. 15). 8 Why is compassion practice so centrally important to a servant-leader? Robert Greenleaf did not say. Nevertheless, compassion scholar-practitioners, like the Dalai Lama, can infer (not a difficult inference for them to draw) from their own practical experience. Since compassion practice is mutually beneficial to both the practitioner and recipient (see Sect. 2.2 above), for a servant-leader, serving-others with compassion arguably \"constitutes the wisest course for fulfilling (enlightened) self-interest (in self-healing)\" (the Dalai Lama 1999, p. 127; parentheses by the authors), so much so that the more compassionate he/she is in serving others, the happier his/her own life-work can become. Operating with this profound discernment of enlightened self-interest, servant-leaders are granted the moral authority to lead (Frick 2017) .",

In a 2020 essay Our curious silence about kindness in planning: challenges of addressing vulnerability and suffering, John Forester shows, drawing on a fine-grained analysis of three real-world examples, that compassion practitioners can be practically effective if and when they make \"contingent, contextually sensitive practical judgments\" prudently (Forester 2020, p. 2) . He provides an ensemble of four strategies for making these judgments well that involves learning, contemplation, and moral improvisation (Ibid., p. 13). Later, in an essay Beyond blame: leadership, collaboration and compassion in the time of COVID-19, he and coauthor George McKibbon stress that these strategies are among the requisites of compassion practice (Forester and McKibbon 2020). 7 Underling Greenleaf's conception of servant-leader is the classic notion of heroic leadership (i.e., \"the great man\" theory in leadership literature) (Frick 2004, p. 339) . For a succinct review of leadership theories, especially on the evolution from traditional \"charismatic,\" \"mythic,\" \"heroic,\" and \"visionary\" leadership to trending \"emergent,\" \"distributed,\" and \"complexity leadership,\" see McKelvey (2010, pp. 4-8) . 8 Here we equate Greenleaf's conception of empathy to the compassion construct by the Dalai Lama. \"[E]mpathy is the imaginative projection of one's own consciousness into another being.\" (Greenleaf 1970 (Greenleaf /2008 \"At a basic level, compassion is understood mainly in terms of empathy-our ability to enter into and, to some extent, share others' suffering.\" (The Dalai Lama 1999, p. 123). article). In fact, long before Robert Greenleaf's 1970 conception, the idea to \"work entirely in the people's interests\" (Mao 1944a, p. 177 ) had been, and still is, the motto of both the Chinese Communist Party (established in 1921) and the governments of the People's Republic of China (established in 1949) . It is written into the constitutions of the Party and the Country (e.g., the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China 2017), and most famously advocated by Chairman Mao Zedong [\u6bdb\u6cfd\u4e1c, (1893 -1976 ], one of the founding fathers of the Party and the People's Republic. In 1944, Chairman Mao wrote an influential essay with a telling title Serve the people (Mao 1944a) , and made a powerful statement in a later speech delivered in the same year: \"All of our cadres (leaders), whatever their rank, are servants of the people, and whatever we do is to serve the people.\" (Mao 1944b, p. 172 ; parenthesis by the authors)",

In this authentic compassion practice (as discussed in Sect. 3.1), Tao Lujia's sole, laser-focused aim of taking swift prosocial action would have well been motivated by a dual intention of serving-others and self-healing. For the servant-leader Tao Lujia, to grant a much-needed greenlight to Linxian people's do-or-die project would help himself as well-it would relieve him from a prolonged psychological burden of regret he has had about the unfulfilled desire to help the Linxian people [see 4.1 in Chen and Xiang (2020) ]. To pursue this aim, he would have necessarily gone through an intertwined process of compassion practice and self-compassion practice (as described in Sect. 2.2). The subsequent boost in his mental well-being-the enduring sense of double happiness and gratitude that he enjoyed [box III in Fig. 1; 4.2 in Chen and Xiang (2020) ]-exemplifies the power of compassion practice in a servant-leader's endeavor of self-healing while serving others.",

Since its completion in 1596, the canal has been conveying spring water from the Honggushan (\u6d2a\u8c37\u5c71) mountain to 18 nearby villages, providing drinking water to the people and domestic animals (Yang 1995, p. 461) . Two hundred years later in 1785 during the Qing Dynasty , the local people named the canal the Duke Xie Canal (\u8c22\u516c\u6e20) and built a memorial hall-the Duke Xie Temple (\u8c22\u516c\u7960), as tokens of appreciation and reverence (Ibid.). 9 Between 1943 and 1944, General Pi Dingjun (\u76ae\u5b9a\u5747), the Commander of the locally based division of the Eighth Route Army, led his troops to build a canal for several villages in the west part of the county where they stayed (Wang and Sang 1995, pp. 13-14; Yang 1995, p. 463) . This came shortly after the Linxian Battle in August 1943 in which his troops defeated the remnant Nationalist forces and Japanese puppet troops (Goodman 2000, p. xxiii, p. 54) . General Pi and his troops left Linxian in September 1944 (Chinanews. com 2014) . Later, the beneficiary villagers appreciatively called it the Goodwill Canal (\u7231\u6c11\u6e20) [Yang 1995, p. 461] to recognize the troops' compassionate, prosocial action through what American political scientist Tania Chacho calls \"soft uses of military power\" (Chacho 2009, p. 3) . 10 In these two examples, Xie Sicong and Pi Dingjun exercised their compassionate servant-leadership effectively. They both had firsthand co-suffering experiences with the Linxian people; both took prosocial actions to help assuage Linxian people's suffering from the hardships of water shortage; and their efforts were successful and acknowledged by the local beneficiaries. Might they have gone through a process of compassion practice comparable to the one Tao Lujia would have gone through (as illustrated in Fig. 1) ? Was Tao Lujia aware of their prosocial actions and the lasting \"goodwill benefits\" the actions brought to the Linxian people (Chacho 2009, p. 3)? Was his 1960 compassionate, prosocial action inspired, even just in part, by those of Xie Sicong and Pi Dingjun? Evidence has yet to be found to answer these questions.",

He regards this status quo as a missing link in the ecopracticological scholarship and calls for more leadership research. The research reported in this article and in its sister piece (i.e., Chen and Xiang 2020) is an attempt, admittedly a rudimentary one, in this direction. Through a real-world example, it shows how positive and powerful a servant-leader's compassion practice, a \"soft side of leadership\" in the eyes of many scholars (Brown 2005) , can be in socio-ecological practice. It also demonstrates, in a rather modest way though, how fruitful the leadership research can be and how much it can potentially enrich the study of socio-ecological practice. With that, we hope that more colleagues from around the world will join us in this worthy endeavor.",
