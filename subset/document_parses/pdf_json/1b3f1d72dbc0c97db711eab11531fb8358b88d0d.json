The necessity of general information being easy-to-read is indispensable, but we must agree that not all information is simplifiable. The unseen concern here lies in the fact that, while the general populace may not be capable of interpreting every kind of information in a correct and complete way, trying to deliver all information to the general audience may lead to misinterpretation, misjudgment, and misunderstanding. In other words, being uninformed about some questions may be much more harmless than provoking a misconception or misunderstanding among the population. [2] [3] [4] In the study design, a crucial concern was raised regarding the search protocol. Some major websites, such as who.int, were excluded from the results because they are not included in the list of commercial websites (.com and.net), or noncommercial websites (.org,.gov, and.edu), and as we know, these websites play the most important role in informing the general population. The last concern to address is about the search terms, as we repeated the study design with 2 different keywords. Although the search results are definitely based on the location, using the keyword \"COVID-19\" instead of \"Coronavirus\"-the less correct and less common word for the purpose-led to remarkably different search results, which may strongly impact the outcomes of the research.",
