In humans, the coronaviruses (HCoV) are associated with respiratory tract illnesses, and its most villainous member is SARS-CoV. This virus was identified in 2003 and causes severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), an often-fatal lung disease in humans (Drosten et al., 2003; Ksiazek et al., 2003; Osterhaus et al., 2004) . The SARS-CoV probably originated from a wild animal reservoir, most likely bats (Lau et al., 2005; Li et al., 2005) , and was transmitted in a zoonotic event to humans via infected civet cats that were marketed and prepared as food in China. The global spread of SARS in early 2003 caused at least 800 deaths and substantial morbidity. The epidemic was contained at the end of 2003 due to a highly effective global public health response, and SARS-CoV is currently not circulating in humans. Nevertheless, at least four coronaviruses are continuously circulating in the human population, especially in young children. Two were discovered recently: HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 Woo et al., 2005b) ; the other two, HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-229E, were identified in the mid-1960s (Tyrrell & Bynoe, 1965; Hamre & Procknow, 1966) . The latter viruses were tested for pathogenicity in human volunteers, which demonstrated that HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 cause the common cold (Bradburne et al., 1967) . For the new viruses HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 a human test system, but also an animal model system, is lacking.

In some of the earliest work on human coronaviruses during the mid-1960s, viruses could be propagated in human embryonic tracheal organ culture that were not, or only distantly, related to HCoV-229E or HCoV-OC43 (Tyrrell & Bynoe, 1965; McIntosh et al., 1967) . Unfortunately these strains [B814 (Tyrrell & Bynoe, 1965) , HCoV-OC16, HCoV-OC37, and HCoV-OC48 (McIntosh et al., 1967) ] were lost for follow-up studies, so it remains undetermined whether these viruses represent HCoV-HKU1 or HCoV-NL63, or yet undiscovered human coronaviruses. Additionally, in the beginning of the 1980s, several isolates of human coronaviruses were studied that were obtained by either cell culture or organ culture (HCoV strains AD, PA, LP, KI, PR, TO, RO, GI, and HO) (Larson et al., 1980; Macnaughton et al., 1981; Reed, 1984) . Some of these isolates turned out to be serologically related to HCoV-OC43, and therefore were termed group II isolates (strains RO, GI and HO), whereas others were serologically related to HCoV-229E and thus were assigned as group I isolates (strains AD, PA, LP, KI, PR, and TO). Of these group I viruses, LP, KI, PR and TO could be cultured in MRC continuous cells (human), but strains AD and PA could only be cultured in human foetal tracheal and nasal organ cultures. In fact, this difference in culture properties reflects the difference in cell tropism of HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 (see 'Cell tropism and receptor usage') and thus raises the possibility that some of these early group I strains (for instance AD and PA) were in fact HCoV-NL63 isolates. Unfortunately, this hypothesis cannot be tested because isolates AD and PA were also lost for further study. The earliest HCoV-NL63 isolate remains the NL-strain that was obtained from a patient in 1988, which was identified as HCoV-NL63 in 2004 .

As a consequence, RNA viruses are known to exist as a dynamic distribution of variants with a closely related, yet non-identical genome centred on a master sequence, the socalled quasispecies concept (Domingo 2002) . These high mutation rates provide RNA viruses with the capacity to increase their level of genetic variability and thereby their ability to adapt quickly to a change in the environment. In addition to the high mutation rate, recombination events increase the level of genetic diversity. Coronavirus recombination is assumed to be mediated by a 'copy choice mechanism' with template switching by the polymerase during RNA-dependent RNA synthesis (Lai et al., 1985; Herrewegh et al., 1998) . In vivo recombination has been described between group I feline and canine coronaviruses, between strains of MHV (mouse hepatitis virus) and between strains of IBV (infectious bronchitis virus) (Herrewegh et al., 1998; Lai & Holmes, 2001) . Phylogenetic analysis of a small part of the 1a gene of HCoV-NL63 shows diversity of the natural isolates and subsequent clustering in NL63 subgroups Arden et al., 2005; Bastien et al., 2005a; Chiu et al., 2005) . The close clustering of isolates from the Netherlands, Belgium, Canada, Hong Kong, Korea and Australia indicates that this clustering does not correlate with the geographic origin ( Fig. 5 ). Phylogenetic analysis of the spike gene also reveals the presence of subgroups (Moes et al., 2005) . Interestingly, but not unexpectedly for coronaviruses, the clustering based on the 1a gene does not match with that of the spike gene, indicating that recombination has occurred between different HCoV-NL63 isolates (Moes et al., 2005; Fig. 5 ). Sequencing of fulllength genomes of field isolates verifies the discordant clustering of 1a-gene sequences and spike sequences and confirms that recombination is also common for HCoV-NL63 (K.

Even though the HCoV-HKU1 sequence was not known at the time that this PCR was designed, alignment of the consensus primers confirms that these primers perfectly match with HCoV-HKU1. Moes et al. (2005) screened 309 respiratory samples from hospitalized children in Leuven, Belgium, and found human coronaviruses in 15 samples (5%, Table 2 ). Of these patients, seven were infected with HCoV-NL63, seven with HCoV-OC43, and a single person with HCoV-229E. These results indicate that HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-OC43 are the two coronaviruses that cause most respiratory infections leading to hospitalization. Similar results were obtained in our laboratory for patients with respiratory disease who were diagnosed in the Public Health Laboratory at the Municipal Health Service of Amsterdam. Of the 63 respiratory samples . In Hong Kong, HCoV-NL63 is the most frequently found coronavirus (2.6%), followed by HCoV-OC43 (1.5%) and HCoV-229E (0.3%) (Chiu et al., 2005) . Vabret et al. obtained similar results in a screen for these three viruses in patients from Caen, France. HCoV-NL63 (9.3%) was detected more frequently than HCoV-OC43 (2.2%), and HCoV-229E was not detected at all. Furthermore, HCoV-NL63 was found most frequently in Swiss neonates with lower respiratory tract illness (7.3%), compared to HCoV-OC43 (6.1%) and HCoV-229E (3.7%) (Kaiser et al., 2005) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 429, "end": 453, "text": "Stephensen et al.

One of the HCoV-NL63 infected elderly Canadian patients died 5 days after the onset of disease (Bastien et al., 2005a) , showing that the severity of the respiratory disease can be substantial. All studies on the incidence of HCoV-NL63 infection have used respiratory clinical material from patients suffering from respiratory tract illnesses, mostly lower respiratory tract illnesses. It is therefore not surprising that the symptoms associated with NL63-infection represent respiratory diseases. Nevertheless, one can provide an initial overview of the symptoms related to HCoV-NL63 infection by focusing on patients without a secondary infection. Table 3 summarizes the symptoms in patients with an HCoV-NL63 infection. These results are derived only from studies that did not select for certain clinical symptoms, because selection for a respiratory disease (e.g. bronchiolitis or lower respiratory tract illness) will bias the overview towards these clinical symptoms. As mentioned above, a substantial number of patients suffered from lower respiratory tract illnesses that required hospitalization. On the other hand, some of the patients showed relatively mild symptoms like fever, cough, sore throat and rhinitis (Bastien et al., 2005a) . For instance, only 16 of the 45 patients with HCoV-NL63 in Canada had been hospitalized because of the respiratory illness, demonstrating that infection with HCoV-NL63 does not always require hospitalization (Bastien et al., 2005a, b) . In the PRI.DE study, which investigated children with lower respiratory tract illness, HCoV-NL63 infection was also more often detected in outpatients than hospitalized patients, confirming that HCoV-NL63 generally causes less severe problems . This suggests strongly that HCoV-NL63, similar to HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, is a common cold virus (McIntosh, 1996) and that HCoV-NL63, like HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, can cause a more severe clinical picture in young children, the elderly and immunocompromised persons (McIntosh et al., 1974; van Elden et al., 2004) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 136, "end": 155, "text": "Arden et al., 2005)", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 253, "end": 276, "text": "(Bastien et al., 2005a)", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 1380, "end": 1403, "text": "(Bastien et al., 2005a)", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 1614, "end": 1640, "text": "(Bastien et al., 2005a, b)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1986, "end": 2002, "text": "(McIntosh, 1996)", "ref_id": "BIBREF46"}, {"start": 2155, "end": 2178, "text": "(McIntosh et al., 1974;", "ref_id": "BIBREF48"}, {"start": 2179, "end": 2202, "text": "van Elden et al., 2004)", "ref_id": "BIBREF71"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 808, "end": 815, "text": "Table 3", "ref_id": "TABREF3"}], "section": "Disease associated with infection"}, {"text": "A link between HCoV-NL63 and respiratory diseases was established in the German prospective population-based study (PRI.DE) on lower respiratory tract illness in children less than 3 years of age Konig et al., 2004) . That study demonstrated a strong association between laryngotracheitis (croup) and HCoV-NL63 infection. Croup is an inflammation of the trachea and is characterized by a loud barking cough that usually worsens at night. Almost half of the HCoV-NL63 positive patients were Both studies observed the high frequency of croup among the HCoV-NL63 positive patients (43% and 27%, respectively) (Chiu et al., 2005; van der Hoek et al., 2005) . Interestingly, HCoV-NL63 has also been associated with Kawasaki disease (Esper et al., 2005a) . Respiratory secretions from 11 children with Kawasaki disease were tested and eight samples were positive for HCoV-NL63 (73%). HCoV-NL63 was detected in only one subject of a control group of 22 patients matched for age with the Kawasaki disease patients who visited the hospital in the same period. These results published by Esper et al. are of obvious relevance. Kawasaki disease is one of the most common forms of childhood vasculitis (Burns & Glode, 2004) . It presents with prolonged fever and a polymorphic exanthem, oropharyngeal erythema, and bilateral conjunctivitis. Scarlet fever and measles are the closest clinical mimics. A number of epidemiological and clinical observations suggested previously that an infectious agent might be the cause of Kawasaki disease. These observations include the acute selflimiting nature of the febrile illness, the peak of incidence in patients under 18 months, the geographic clustering of outbreaks, and the seasonal predominance of the illness in late winter/early spring (Kuijpers et al., 1999) . Coronary complications can be reduced significantly by the use of intravenous immunoglobulin therapy combined with oral aspirin (Burns, 2001) . The link between HCoV-NL63 and Kawasaki disease is fascinating; however, multiple groups recently questioned the association between Kawasaki disease and HCoV-NL63. These groups screened for HCoV-NL63 in respiratory material of Kawasaki disease patients, but none were able to confirm the findings by Esper et al.

This means that during a lifetime virtually everybody will experience an infection with these viruses, and everybody will consequently carry antibodies against these viruses. Expression of a fragment of the HCoV-NL63 spike protein -a part unique to HCoV-NL63 -in Escherichia coli and subsequent analysis for antibody recognition revealed that this protein was recognized in all healthy adults who were tested (n = 18) on Western blot. These sera were also capable of virus neutralization in cell culture infections, indicating that adults have neutralizing antibodies that are specific for HCoV-NL63 (K. Pyrc and L. van der Hoek, unpublished results) . This result was confirmed in quantitative infection assays using pseudotyped virus. Pseudotyping is a method that uses pseudovirions to investigate the interaction between the spike protein of HCoV-NL63 and the target cell. The functional organization of coronavirus spike proteins is similar to that of the glycoprotein from retroviruses, and spike proteins can be incorporated into the membrane of retrovirus particles. These pseudovirions accurately mimic receptor engagement and membrane fusion of the coronavirus and can be used to study the capacity of sera to inhibit binding of the coronavirus spike to the target cell. Retroviral particles expressing the HCoV-NL63 spike protein or the HCoV-229E spike protein were compared in neutralization assays. Sera that showed specific reactivity against the NL63 spike on western blot and that neutralized the virus in cell culture infections also neutralized infection in the NL63-pseudovirions assay (Hofmann et al., 2005) . Surprisingly, a completely different result was obtained with the 229E-pseudovirions. HCoV-229E neutralization occurred only in a minority of the samples from adults (Hofmann et al., 2005) . This result reinforces the idea that infection with HCoV-NL63 is much more common than HCoV-229E infection. Neutralizing NL63-antibodies are, on average, acquired before the age of 8 years, but thus far only a limited number of sera from the different age groups have been tested (Hofmann et al., 2005) . Screening a larger number of samples with an NL63-specific-ELISA will allow a more precise determination of the average age at which HCoV-NL63 is acquired. An NL63-ELISA will also prove valuable to critically test whether Kawasaki disease in young children is accompanied by seroconversion or an increase in HCoV-NL63-specific antibodies.

The spike of HCoV-NL63 is a class I fusion protein, similar to the influenza virus haemagglutinin and the HIV-1 Env glycoprotein gp120/gp41. The amino-terminal part of the spike protein (S1) contains the receptor-binding domain and the carboxy-terminal part (S2) contains a membranespanning region, two heptad repeat regions (HR1 and HR2) and the fusion peptide. Before the discovery of HCoV-NL63 it was generally thought that all group I coronaviruses use CD13 (also known as aminopeptidase N) as receptor, in view of the fact that it was described for HCoV-229E, porcine coronaviruses TGEV (transmissible gastroenteritis virus) and PRCoV (porcine respiratory coronavirus), and the feline and canine coronaviruses (Delmas et al., 1992; Yeager et al., 1992; Tresnan et al., 1996) . Unexpectedly, HCoV-NL63 is not able to use CD13 as receptor for cell entry (Hofmann et al., 2005) . The cell types that support virus replication already suggested an unusual receptor usage of HCoV-NL63. The virus replicates in monkey kidney cells , whereas its closest relative, HCoV-229E, does not. Intriguingly, SARS-CoV is also able to replicate in monkey kidney cells. Being from a different coronavirus group (SARS-CoV is from group IIb), this similarity in cell tropism is surprising. A more detailed analysis of the cell tropism revealed that certain human cells can also be infected by HCoV-NL63, namely Huh-7 cells: a human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line (Hofmann et al., 2005) . This underscores the resemblance of HCoV-NL63 and SARS-CoV because Huh-7 cells can also be infected by the latter coronavirus. The shared cell tropism is suggestive of a shared receptor usage by HCoV-NL63 and SARS-CoV. SARS-CoV was unique among the coronaviruses in that it uses angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) to bind to and to enter target cells (Li et al., 2003) . ACE2 is a surface molecule that was not known previously as a receptor for coronaviruses. Subsequently, Hofmann et al. (2005) showed that HCoV-NL63 is the only other coronavirus next to SARS-CoV that uses ACE2 as entry receptor. This surface molecule is localized to the ciliated cells of human nasal and tracheobronchial airway epithelia, thus supporting the presence of virus infection in the upper airways (Sims et al., 2005) . The HCoV-NL63 receptor ACE2 is a homologue of the ACE protein, and both are key enzymes of the renin-angiotensin system. ACE activates the renin-angiotensin system by cleaving angiotensin I into angiotensin II, whereas ACE2 negatively regulates this system by inactivating angiotensin II. The renin-angiotensin system has a crucial role in severe acute lung injury , with ACE2 playing a protective role in lung failure and its counterpart ACE promoting lung oedemas and impaired lung function during acute lung injury. Interestingly, infection with SARS-CoV suppresses the expression of ACE2 protein and it has been hypothesized that the reduced level of ACE2 during SARS-CoV infection is the main cause of the severe pneumonia and acute, often lethal, lung failure . It seems important to compare the pathogenicity of SARS-CoV and HCoV-NL63 with respect to ACE2 binding and downregulation. The reduced pathogenicity of HCoV-NL63 suggests that ACE2 binding by the virus is not the only factor that determines the severity of viral pathogenicity. Further research on this subject is warranted, especially on the modulation of the ACE2 expression levels during HCoV-NL63 infection, to understand the difference in lung pathogenicity of SARS-CoV and HCoV-NL63.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 825, "end": 846, "text": "(Delmas et al., 1992;", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 847, "end": 867, "text": "Yeager et al., 1992;", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 868, "end": 889, "text": "Tresnan et al., 1996)", "ref_id": "BIBREF66"}, {"start": 967, "end": 989, "text": "(Hofmann et al., 2005)", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 1561, "end": 1583, "text": "(Hofmann et al., 2005)", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 1941, "end": 1958, "text": "(Li et al., 2003)", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}, {"start": 2065, "end": 2086, "text": "Hofmann et al.

Treatment of Huh-7 cells with bafilomycin A or NH 4 Cl revealed that entry driven by NL63-S protein depends on the low-pH environment in intracellular vesicles (Hofmann et al., 2005) .

As yet, however, the exact mechanism by which these agents inhibit HCoV-NL63 transcription is unclear. Finally, protease inhibitors act at the level of posttranslational processing. The M pro of coronaviruses has a highly conserved substraterecognition pocket, thus providing the opportunity to design broad-spectrum antiviral drugs against several coronavirus species (Yang et al., 2005) .

The isolate from 1988 proves this, but also the literature from the mid 1960s and 1980s indicates that human coronaviruses other than HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 circulated in those days. The symptoms observed during infection with HCoV-NL63 resemble those observed in children infected with HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43: upper and lower respiratory tract illnesses. However, the high frequency of croup is typical for HCoV-NL63 infection. The first publications on HCoV-NL63 were from two Dutch research groups, but infection with this virus is not restricted to the Netherlands. Numerous groups have reported HCoV-NL63 infections worldwide. The virus was detected in 1-10% of the screened patient groups and a peak is observed in the winter season in most countries. Only in Hong Kong has a spring-summer seasonality been described, which may be caused by the subtropical climate.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Conclusions"}, {"text": "The HCoV-NL63 genome sequence is most similar to HCoV-229E, and has a low similarity to the group II coronaviruses HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and SARS-CoV. Given the evolutionary distance with the latter virus, it is striking that HCoV-NL63 and SARS-CoV share the same receptor for target cell entry. This receptor, ACE2, is a member of the renin-angiotensin system, but it is also involved in the protection against lung damage. The influence of HCoV-NL63 infection on ACE2 expression is of interest as it has been postulated that the down-regulation of ACE2 during SARS-CoV infection is a major factor in the pathogenicity of SARS.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Conclusions"}, {"text": "The identification of NL63-variants with distinct genetic markers underscores that HCoV-NL63 was not recently introduced into the human population. The clustering of the NL63-variants is not based on geographical distribution, as the different subtypes appear to coexist. Phylogenetic analysis of the 1a and spike genes of field isolates supplies evidence for the occurrence of recombination. The shared receptor usage by SARS-CoV provides the opportunity for double infection of the same cell. Consequently, there is a risk of recombination between these two viruses, with the possibility that more pathogenic variants of HCoV-NL63 can evolve. Several antiviral agents are in development that potentially inhibit HCoV-NL63 infection, and these can be used to develop an effective antiviral treatment.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Conclusions"}, {"text": "Finally, there is an urgent need for an infectious cDNA clone and an appropriate animal model system to study the virus in more detail.
