            "text": "Previous studies have highlighted the importance of imaging biomarkers in the diagnosis, management, and therapeutic trial investigation of MS. The formation of white matter lesions in the brain is an established hallmark of MS pathogenesis, and their presentation on MR images is employed in the differential diagnosis of MS from other disease mimics. 1 The formation and persistence of T1-hypointense (\"black hole\") lesions, which suggest axonal loss and tissue destruction, have been associated with disability and disease progression in MS patients. [2] [3] [4] Brain volume changes, notably whole brain atrophy, which are quantified in measurements obtained from MR images, have been shown to be correlated with disability progression in patients with MS. 5, 6 Rates of gray matter atrophy have been shown to differ across different stages of MS, 7 and both white and gray matter atrophy have been linked to the development of neuropsychological symptoms and cognitive impairment in patients with MS. 8 Accurately estimating brain volumes and lesion load is crucial for defining disease status to evaluate individual patients and assess the efficacy of therapies in clinical trials; however, volumetric measurements have been shown to vary across a subject's measures even under ideal research conditions where scanning technique (equipment and pulse sequence parameters), and duration of follow-up are carefully controlled. 9 Previous studies that explored site or scanner effect in either healthy people or people living with Alzheimer's disease have reported mixed results, with some demonstrating that the use of multiple scanners has the potential to exacerbate biases in estimated average brain volumes and negatively affect the reproducibility of various measures across different sites and scanners, 10, 11 while others have demonstrated high reproducibility regardless of scanner. [12] [13] [14] Site-related biases in brain volumes and methods for mitigating such bias including protocol standardization and image harmonization have been investigated in patients living with MS, [15] [16] [17] yet much remains to be understood regarding the full extent of how site affects variation in images when MS pathology is present.",
