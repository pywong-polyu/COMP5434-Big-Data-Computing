Twenty-four patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of the Ezhou Central Hospital from February 1 to March 22, 2020. According to the 28-day prognosis, they were assigned to a death group and a survival group. On the 3rd day of ICU admission, peripheral blood and alveolar lavage fluid were collected for examination of lymphocyte subsets and inflammatory factors by flow cytometry and immunoturbidimetry, respectively. The CD3 + , CD4 + , and CD8 + cell counts in alveolar lavage fluid and serum were significantly higher in the survival group than those of the death group (p < .05). The levels of IL-6, HS-CRP, and PCT in the alveolar lavage fluid and serum of the death group were statistically higher than those of the survival group (p < .05); The CD3 + , CD4 + cell count, and IL-6 level were negatively correlated with Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) and Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II scores, respectively (p < .05). The CD4 + cell and SOFA score have a regression relationship for the prognosis of COVID-19 severe patients. The CD3 + , CD4 + , CD8 + cells, and IL-6 levels are valuable in determining the prognosis of severe COVID-19 pneumonia and are strongly correlated with the severity of the disease; the CD4 + cell is an independent risk factor affecting the prognosis of COVID-19 pneumonia.

            "text": "In addition, a few studies 27, 28 have indicated that some inflammatory factors can exacerbate kidney injuries, such as tumor necrosis factor and IL-6. Moreover, Li et al. 29 have reported that cytokine storm may be an important mechanism of viral sepsis and MODS in patients with COVID-19, including acute kidney injury. Furthermore, some autopsy findings have revealed that extensive endothelial cell damage in the heart, kidney, small intestine and liver in COVID- 19, 30 triggering excessive thrombin production, inhibiting fibrinolysis, and activating the complement pathway, causing a thrombotic inflammatory response, ultimately leading to microthrombus deposition and microvascular dysfunction, which may promote further evolution of acute tubular necrosis into cortical necrosis, resulting in irreversible renal failure. 16, 31 Obviously, SARS-CoV-2 can affect the cellular immunity of patients. T lymphocytes are involved in the cellular immune function of the body and can be divided into two subgroups, CD4 + and CD8 + T lymphocytes, which have killing and auxiliary killing functions, respectively. One clinical study has demonstrated that most patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection have decreased lymphocytes, 32 in addition, another study has shown that a significant decrease in the total number of lymphocytes indicates that coronavirus consumes many immune cells and suppresses the immune function of human cells, and the damage of T lymphocytes may be an important factor leading to the deterioration of the patient's condition. 33 There are differences in T lymphocyte subsets between critical and noncritical groups, but CD4 + T lymphocytes were more significantly decreased than CD8 + T lymphocytes in the critical group. 34 During the SARS outbreak in 2003, investigators also paid more attention to the T lymphocyte subsets. In the lung interstitium of SARS patients, CD8 + T cells account for approximately 80% of total infiltrating inflammatory cells and play an important role in clearing SARS-CoV from infected cells and inducing immune damage. 35 The depletion of CD4 + T cells is associated with recruitment of F I G U R E 2 ROC curve of prognostic factors in patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia.COVID-19, coronavirus disease 2019; ROC, receiver operating curve; SOFA, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment lymphocytes in the lung, neutralizing antibodies and decreased cytokine production, resulting in strong immune response and interstitial pneumonia, which delays the clearance of SARS-CoV from the lung. 36 The combination of virus replication in the lower respiratory tract and abnormal immune response may have an impact on the severity of the disease, similar to what has been demonstrated in SARS and MERS. 33 Chiu, W et al. 37 have found that the level of T lymphocytes is strongly associated with the prognosis of patients with severe influenza-A virus infection and that patients with low CD4 + T cells have a higher risk of death within 28 days after admission. In inclusion of more than 100 SARS-CoV-2 infection cases with obesity, diabetes, and cardiocerebrovascular diseases also have continuously decreased in lymphocytes and increased ferritin and cytokines, such as IL-6, which may cause the disease rapidly developed into ARDS and prolonged disease course. 32 In this study, we found that in patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia, CD3 + , CD4 + , CD8 + cell counts of the alveolar lavage fluid and serum in the survival group were significantly higher than those in the death group. In the survival group, the IL-6, HS-CRP, and PCT of the level alveolar lavage fluid and serum were lower than those in the death group, the difference was statistically significant (p < .05);",

The study also found that the levels of CD3 + , CD4 + , CD8 + in alveolar lavage fluid of the death group were significantly lower than those in the serum, while the levels of IL-6, PCT, and HS-CRP, were higher than those in the serum, indicating that viral infection leads to abnormal oxygen and carbon dioxide exchange in the alveoli, as well as secondary inflammation-mediated immune response disorder, which results in rapid disease progression. The correlation analysis of this study found that the levels of CD3 + , CD4 + , and IL-6 were significantly negatively correlated with SOFA and APACHE II score, suggesting that with the multiple organ dysfunction, the decrease of CD3 + and CD4 + and the increase of IL-6 are related to the severity of COVID-19 pneumonia.",

By performing a binary logistic analysis in this study, the CD4 + cells and SOFA score were considered as independent risk factors affecting the prognosis of patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia. Furthermore, the area under the curve of CD4 + was 77.7% through the ROC curve, suggesting that the level of CD4 + cell has a certain clinical value in determining the prognosis of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia and its diagnostic efficacy is not different from SOFA with the area of 77.5% under the curve.",

In this study, by examining the changes of cellular immunity and inflammatory factors in the alveolar lavage fluid and serum of patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia, we attempt to understand the impact of immune function and inflammatory response on the progression and prognosis of disease to provide a theoretical basis for the immune status and systemic inflammatory response of patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia.",

A study showed that IL-6 is an important mediator synthesized during acute inflammation and an important cytokine involved in the inflammatory response, playing a role in the induction of acute-phase proteins synthesis in hepatocytes and pro-inflammatory effects on a variety of cells. 38 In the early stage of infection, an appropriate increase in IL-6 can help maintain the internal homeostasis of the body, defend against various pathogens and help control the progression of inflammation. However, its large release can induce excessive inflammatory response and damage to tissues and organs, as well as induce a series of pathological changes in the microcirculation and vascular endothelium, 39,40 which may be related to the occurrence of acute myocardial injury in COVID-19 patients. Nevertheless, a recent study from Romania has shown that the level of IL-6 in serum is not necessarily related to inflammation at the tissue level in the early stage of infection, suggesting that it may not be an appropriate indicator for diagnosing and predicting the onset of mild inflammation. 41",
