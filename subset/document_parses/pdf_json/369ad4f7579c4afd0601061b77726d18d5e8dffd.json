Further uneven distribution of the health workforce is a major barrier to the effective diagnosis and treatment of CRDs. Teleconsultation between a specialist and non-specialist could possibly bridge the gap in access to health care and decrease CRD burden in remote areas. This review investigates the evidence for the effective use of specialist to non-specialist teleconsultation in the management of CRDs in remote areas and identifies instances of good practice and knowledge gaps.",

The included studies reported primarily non-clinical outcomes including effectiveness, feasibility, acceptability and usability of the teleconsultation systems and only three described the clinical outcomes.

The World Health Organization (WHO)-Global Health Observatory reports that over 40% of member countries of WHO, all LMICs, have less than one physician per 1000 population [1] . The African Region suffers more than 24% of the global burden of all diseases but has access to only 3% of health workers and less than 1% of the world's financial resources [1] . The unbalanced distribution of health care personnel by specialities adds to these disparities [2] . In India, while 69% of Indian population resides in rural areas and they are served by 22% of all health care providers compared with the 31% urban citizens who have access to 78% of trained health care professionals [3, 4] . Poor access to transport and inadequate transport infrastructure in rural areas further aggravates the scarcity of health care workforce leaving a large proportion of the rural population without easy access to trained health care providers.",

COCIR, the European Trade Association, representing the medical imaging, radiotherapy, health ICT and electromedical industries suggests a simpler definition that: \"Telemedicine includes all areas where medical or social data is being sent/exchanged between at least two remote locations, including both Caregiver-Patient/Citizen as well as Doctor to Doctor communication\" [5] . This definition is most applicable where telemedicine seems to have widened its scope to a variety of health information exchange for managing health and well-being of the population.

Asthma is the 14 th most important disorder in the world in terms of the disease burden [14] , and COPD is the third leading cause of death, worldwide [15] . Diagnosis of these chronic respiratory diseases is based on detailed patient history and clinical assessment, aided by specialised tests such as spirometry and peak expiratory flow readings. However, interpreting the results of such tests require specialised training [16] . Specialists are not always available in rural regions worldwide. A study conducted in the US reported that less than one-third of the rural population, but nearly 98% of the urban American population had access to a pulmonologist within a 10-mile radius [17] . The situation in low-and middle-income countries (LMICs) like India is comparatively worse. The Association of Chest Physicians of India lists 2413 chest physicians in a country of 1.3 billion people, more than 95% of these are registered at in large urban areas [18] as compared to American Thoracic Society comprising of more than 16 000 registered members including physicians, researchers, advanced practice nurses, respiratory therapists which serves nearly 331 million population [19] . The rural areas in LMICs are primarily served by primary care physicians (PCP) or allied health staff including Auxiliary Nurse Midwives (ANMs) nurses or pharmacists for delivery of primary health care [20] . Lack of access to pulmonologists and other specialists required for the diagnosis and management of the CRDs may be one of the factors contributing to the misclassification or delayed diagnosis of CRDs and inappropriate disease management. Use of teleconsultation to remotely support the PCPs by engaging specialists could help in scaling up CRD diagnosis and treatment.",

Fadaizadeh et al. reported high physician satisfaction and acceptance of teleconsultation by the specialists [36] . Further, telespirometry was well accepted and could be easily performed by a large number of PCPs [31, 32] . The rate of acceptable spirometric tests can be improved if the tests are performed under the supervision of trained technicians rather than by the PCPs [28, 33, 35] . One study showed that the service was perceived to stimulate cooperation between primary and secondary care, and deliver support to patients locally which is important in rural areas [35] . Telepulmonology, by improving the collaboration between PCP and pulmonary specialist, may prevent unnecessary face-to-face referrals thus saving time, and aiding in preventing under and misdiagnosis of COPD [34] .",

Three papers described the ongoing systems [29, 33, 37] , two of which used descriptive statistics to report the outcomes quantitatively [29, 37] and the remaining one was a narrative technical description of the teleconsultation system [33] .

Further, high-quality research to demonstrate the efficacy of the use of specialist to non-specialist consultation for managing CRDs is required to be conducted in controlled settings. A strategy to build evidence to deploy specialist to non-specialist teleconsultation to manage CRDs will aid further research [44, 45] . More high-quality controlled studies are required to confirm these suggestions.
