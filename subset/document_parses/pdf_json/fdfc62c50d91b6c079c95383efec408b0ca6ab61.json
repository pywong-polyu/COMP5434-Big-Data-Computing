Also called safe distancing in Singapore, social distancing is a series of measures designed to prevent the transmission of the virus from human to human and is essentially a variety of means of physical separation. Key consistent features of public health advice across the world include staying indoors, working from home where possible and avoiding social gatherings.",

When individuals leave the house, they are advised to keep a specific minimum distance from other people, but this is where some of the consistency of advice ends.",

This varies from 1 m as advised by the World Health Organization (WHO), Singapore and Hong Kong, to 1.5 m in Australia. The USA advises 1.8 m (the equivalent of 6 feet) and the UK, Ireland and New Zealand favour 2 m. All governments state that their advice is based on the scientific evidence underpinning the control of pandemics. So how do different countries come up with different recommendations and do the public know what these distances actually look like?",

Recent work by Guo et al. suggests that maybe none of these distances is fully protective for Covid-19 with spread of up to 4 m reported in a hospital setting although it is not clear if particles travelling this far are infectious [1] .",
