A known challenge with multi-label classification is the long-tailed distribution of labels. Many studies focus on improving the overall predictions of the model and thus do not prioritise tail-end labels. Improving the tail-end label predictions in multi-label classifications of medical text enables the potential to understand patients better and improve care. The knowledge gained by one or more infrequent labels can impact the cause of medical decisions and treatment plans. This research presents variations of concatenated domain-specific language models, including multi-BioMed-Transformers, to achieve two primary goals. First, to improve F1 scores of infrequent labels across multi-label problems, especially with long-tail labels; second, to handle long medical text and multi-sourced electronic health records (EHRs), a challenging task for standard transformers designed to work on short input sequences. A vital contribution of this research is new state-of-the-art (SOTA) results obtained using TransformerXL for predicting medical codes. A variety of experiments are performed on the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-III) database. Results show that concatenated BioMed-Transformers outperform standard transformers in terms of overall micro and macro F1 scores and individual F1 scores of tail-end labels, while incurring lower training times than existing transformer-based solutions for long input sequences.",

For short or truncated electronic health records (EHRs), medical domain-specific transformer models outperform state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods for many classification tasks, including predicting medical codes and name entity recognition [31, 14, 13] . However, given that most transformer models are limited to a maximum sequence length of 512 tokens, with some exceptions, there is still a gap in alternative solutions for long documents. Transformer models such as Longformer [4] and TransformerXL [8] can handle longer sequences and perform better than other language models for long documents. Unfortunately, these models require considerable amounts of memory and processing time. In contrast, concatenated domain-specific transformers require fewer resources.",

(2021) [11] presents evidence showing BERT-based models under-perform in clinical text classification tasks with long input data, such as MIMIC-III [15] , when compared to a CNN trained on word embeddings that can process the complete input sequences. Si and Roberts (2021) [24] presents an alternative system to overcome the issue of long documents, where transformer-based encoders are used to learn from words to sentences, sentences to notes and notes to patients progressively. This transformer-based hierarchical attention networks system presents SOTA methods for in-hospital mortality prediction and phenotype predictions using MIMIC-III. However, it requires considerable computational resources [24] . Chalkidis et al. (2020) [6] proposes a similar hierarchical version using SCI-BERT to deal with long documents for predicting medical codes from MIMIC III. Here SCI-BERT reads words of each sentence, resulting in sentence embeddings. This is followed by a self-attention mechanism that reads the sentence embeddings to produce single document embeddings fed through an output layer. Unfortunately, HIER-SCI-BERT performed poorly compared to other neural networks [6] . One possible reason for poor results is the use of a continuously pre-trained BERT model [6] . The continuous training approach would initialise with the standard BERT model, pre-trained using Wikipedia and BookCorpus. It then continues the pre-training process with a masked language model and next-sentence prediction using domain-specific data. In this case, the vocabulary is the same as the original BERT model, which is considered a disadvantage for domain-specific tasks [13] . For our research, PubMedBERT [13] , a domain-specific BERT based model trained solely on biomedical text, is used.",

Examples of predicting medical codes using transformers include ICD-10 predictions from German documents [1, 23] , and predicting frequent medical codes from MIMIC-III [5, 31] . These examples restrict themselves to (1) truncated text sequences of < 512 tokens and (2) predicting frequent labels [5, 2] . MIMIC-III consists of many infrequent labels, as shown in Figure 1 , where most codes only occur in a small number of clinical documents. This research focuses on improving the predictive accuracy for infrequent labels and using long medical texts. Moons et al. (2020) [21] presents a survey of deep learning methods for ICD coding of medical documents and indicates Convolutional Attention for Multi-Label classification (CAML) [22] as the SOTA method for automatically predicting medical codes from EHRs. [31] presents evidence to show that domain-specific transformers outperform CAML for truncated sequences. Liu et al (2021) [19] presents the most recent evidence where EffectiveCAN -an effective convolution attention network-outperforms SOTA for predicting medical codes. We extend the findings in [31] by providing evidence to show TransformerXL outperforms CAML and sets new SOTA results for predicting medical codes. We also present a direct comparison with EffectiveCAN for the same multi-label problem with the same labels and data to show transformers such as TransformerXL outperform SOTA.",

Multi-PubMedBERT and multi-BioMed-RoBERTa show a consistent improvement of 3% to 7% in micro-F1 scores over single PubMedBERT and BioMed-RoBERTa, respectively. The macro-F1 score of TriplePubMedBERT option is better than other language models presented with at least 3% improvement, except for TransformerXL with 3,072 tokens. Macro F1 scores of multi-CNNText and CNNText with transformers perform poorly compared to all other language models presented. For cardiovascular disease, incorporating ecg and rad does show some improved overall results, especially with TriplePubMedBERT options. Critical difference plots for individual label F1 scores obtained using various language models in Table 2 are presented in Figure 3 . Both Table 2 and Figure 3 show that TransformerXL with dis 3,072 tokens is the best option. However, multi-BioMed-Transformers show improvements, especially when compared to single-BioMed-Transformers. Table 3 presents micro and macro F1 scores for various language model variations for COVID-19 patient shielding and systemic fungal or bacterial infection using MIMIC-III data. For systemic fungal or bacterial infections multi-PubMedBERT show improvements of 12% to 19 % in micro-F1, and 2% to 10% in macro-F1 scores over single PubMedBERT, except for TriplePub-MedBERT with rad and ecg, where the macro-F1 score is on par with single Fig. 3 : Critical difference plots. Nemenyi post-hoc test (95% confidence level), identifying statistical differences between language models for cardiovascular disease presented in Table 2 . PubMedBERT. Contrary to the case of cardiovascular disease, here the additional inputs of ecg and rad do not result in better performance. It is likely that ecg and rad are not that relevant for coding fungal or bacterial infections. Table 3 for COVID-19 patient shielding shows TransformerXL with dis 3,072 tokens to be the best option, as observed with the other case studies. DualPubMedBERT show improvements over single PubMedBERT and other variations of multi-PubMedBERT. All three case studies show that TransformerXL with dis 3,072 tokens is the top performer in terms of predictive performance. However, concatenated BioMed-Transformers show improvements, especially when compared to single BioMed-Transformers. Table 3 also presents the time per epoch in seconds for systemic fungal or bacterial infection to provide a direct comparison among the language models. TransformerXL (3,072) requirements are much greater than that of other language models, including multi-PubMedBERT, for example, needing 240 hours (for dis 3,072) when DualPubMedBERT only requires 22 hours. Table 3 also presents micro and macro F1 scores for levels 2 and 3 of ICD-9 codes using MIMIC-III data. As mentioned above, due to the processing time required by TransformerXL (3,072), we only use Longformer for encoding long Table 3 , where critical difference is calculated for individual label F1 scores. documents for ICD-9 level 3.

DualPubMedBERT shows improvements in both micro and macro F1 scores by 3% to 5% over other PubMed-BERT variations, and macro-F1 of DualPubMedBERT and Longformer are equal and only marginally behind TransformerXL. For MIMIC-III Level 3 codes, the macro-F1 score of DualPubMedBERT is better than other transformer models, including Longformer. However, CAML (T100SG) outperforms all variations of transformer models. Figure 4 presents the critical difference plots for results presented in Table 3.

Table 1 presents the number of labels with frequency \u2265 1% , and tail-end labels (with label frequency < 1%). With the exception of a few specific labels, including ICD-9 code 508 for COVID-19 patient shielding problem, in general F1-scores of concatenated Bio-Med-Transformers for tail-end labels are consistently better. This improvement is more evident for long tail-end cases such as levels 2 and 3 of ICD-9 codes where there is also an improvement in the number of labels with F1-score = 0. Tables 2 and 3 show the overall performance of Longformer and Trans-formerXL in general are better, especially when compared to single Bio-Med-Transformers. To analyse the difference in tail-end label F1 scores we also present the actual difference between F1-scores by calculating the differences of F1 scores between a particular language model variation and Longformer or TransformerXL, hence, negative values indicate Longformer or TransformerXL have a better F1 score.

Due to space restrictions only tail-end labels are presented. However, it is important to note that for frequent labels, the F1 scores of Longformer are on par or better than the other three models. Smaller differences in F1 scores are noticed among the most frequent labels, and occasional dual and triple models perform slightly better than Longformer for specific labels. In general, Longformer has the most wins over other models for label frequency \u2265 1%. This pattern is reversed for tail-end labels, with Longformer losing more to the dual and triple models where the difference in F1 scores is noted. For some tail-end labels, these differences are noticeably higher than other labels. Level 3 contains 923 labels, with more than 650 labels being infrequent. Figure 6 also shows Longformer losing more to dual transformers at tail-end labels. Table 5 presents the number of per-label wins, draws, and losses for levels 2 and 3 ICD-9 codes, and fungal or bacterial infections. For multi-label problems, F1-scores of many infrequent labels are zero. This observation is also evident in Figures 5 and 6 . To quantify the observations, differences of F1 scores are presented as wins, draws and losses. For most cases, draws are where the F1 scores are zero.
