Therefore, clinical diagnosis relies mainly on serology and in recent years also on molecular methods. Detection of anti-Mycoplasma IgM antibody usually indicates acute infection. In adults, IgM antibodies may not develop and only an immunoglobulin G (IgG) response can be detected, especially in cases of re-infection [11] . However, this is not the case in children where past infection by M. pneumoniae is unlikely and therefore measurement of IgM is considered a quite reliable method for diagnosis. The direct detection of M. pneumoniae nucleotide sequences from clinical specimens such as sputum, nasopharyngeal aspirate, or pharyngeal swab, has been proven to be a very sensitive and specific approach, which offers a rapid diagnosis of infection [12, 13] . However, in some cases, detection of M. pneumoniae from respiratory tract secretions may only indicate carriage [10] . The utilization of a combined approach of serology with PCR techniques, if available, may surpass the limitations of either technique when used alone.",
