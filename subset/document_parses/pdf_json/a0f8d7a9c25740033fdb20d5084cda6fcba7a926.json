Specifically, schizoaffective patients have shown peaks of manic symptoms with sexual disinhibition, while psychotic patients characterized by negative symptoms have developed loneliness feelings, with increasing protective psychotic regressions: initially, they need support to take care of self-hygiene; then they need support to carry on basic daily life activities such as eating and drinking. Other psychotic patients, after 2 weeks of lockdown, have started to reschedule their daily plan with compulsive activities, such as excessive physical activities or eating, while others have increased specific unusual thoughts focussed on the fear of being infected by others or to infect others.",
