We fitted logistic regression models and reported odds ratios (ORs) for being admitted to the ICU. First, we modeled FBG as a continuous variable and reported the OR for each 1 and 5 mmol/L increase. Secondly, we created a dichotomous variable based on a 7 mmol/L cutoff point and reported the OR by comparing those patients with FBG $7 mmol/L to those with levels lower than this cutoff value. We also investigated an alternative binary cutoff at 11 mmol/L, assuming a random blood glucose sample. Thirdly, we created three groups based on FBG levels: ,5.6 mmol/L (reference), between 5.6 and 6.9 mmol/L, and $7 mmol/L, according to the American Diabetes Association diagnosis guidelines of prediabetes and diabetes. Finally, we applied a penalized spline function to the FBG variable to investigate the nature of any potential nonlinear relationship with the odds of ICU admission. Penalized splines are smoothing nonparametric functions that allow more flexibility in the exposure-response curve (8) . The advantage of these splines is that they are governed by goodness-of-fit with a penalty for roughness (e.g., too wiggly curves). This property forces a smoothing that avoids both under-or overfitting the data (9). The penalized splines were implemented in generalized additive models using the mgcv package in R.",

About 262 (63%) patients were males; 97 (23%) patients were diagnosed with diabetes prior to infection; and 82 (20%) patients were admitted to the ICU. In the linear model, a 1 mmol/L increase in FBG was associated with 1.59 times (95% CI 1.38-1.89, P , 0.001) higher odds of being admitted to the ICU.

            "text": "In any epidemiological investigation, the underlying assumptions in the linear models dictate that one has a monotone increase in risk (slope) and a monotone likelihood ratio on errors. Two problems may arise from these assumptions: 1) that there will always be a similar magnitude of increased risk for every unit increase in the exposure, which is likely not realistic as some patients demonstrate a certain threshold, after which the rate of risk increase slows; and 2) that by reducing the curve to a line, the observed variance of response and measurement error will not be as homogeneous as expected under the linear models (10,11). On the other hand, the dichotomous and categorical approaches are even more problematic. These types of exposure-response models assume that the risk within any category is completely homogeneous, i.e., a stepfunction assumption that is also unrealistic (12) . Then there is the debate on choosing the cutoff points. For example, a patient with a FBG of 7.0 mmol/L has a nearly 15-fold higher odds of being admitted to the ICU as compared with a patient who might have a FBG of 6.9 mmol/L. Alternatively, the nonlinear approach of penalized splines is a nonparametric estimation with no prior assumption on the shape of the exposure-response relationship. It follows the data and is only guided by goodness-of-fit. Yet, the interpretation of such models is not straightforward, although the plot can be self-explanatory. Our results could have important clinical ramifications for both strict glucose management on admission and prediction of in-hospital complications. First, we propose that the optimal level at which aggressive glucose control should be initiated cannot be determined using conventional modeling of FBG. Even a small incremental increase within the normal range is associated with a substantial increase in risk. Secondly, understanding that a moderately elevated level of FBG is very valuable in predicting risk for ICU admission, which can assist clinicians to better manage the epidemic, especially in countries like Kuwait where diabetes is prevalent.",
