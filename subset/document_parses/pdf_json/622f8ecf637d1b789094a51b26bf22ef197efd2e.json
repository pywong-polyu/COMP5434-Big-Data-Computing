In fact, ASR is defined in the ICD as \"normal given the severity of the stressor\" [1] . Whereas ASRs are fear-based responses to present realworld dangers, anxiety disorders manifest from an anticipation of possible future dangers owing to their occurrence in the past. The absence of a DSM-5 diagnosis for ASRs may also suggest that these symptoms are too transitory to be seen in a clinical setting or merit diagnosis.

Importantly, however, there is no research that directly links ASR with subsequent disorders. The closest evidence addressing the link between ASR and subsequent adjustment is Zahava Solomon's longitudinal work with Israeli soldiers who participated in the 1982 Lebanon War [8, 9] . Solomon and colleagues compared soldiers who were referred by a battalion surgeon to psychiatric care for what they termed a combat stress reaction 1 -a shifting set of symptoms such as restlessness, withdrawal, and confusion-to soldiers who were not referred for a combat stress reaction. Soldiers with a combat stress reaction were at greater risk for subsequent development of PTSD 1 year [9] and 20 years later [8] . These analyses suggest a link between combat stress reaction and PTSD, but conclusions do not necessarily apply to an ASR because soldiers in this study were assessed after the traumatic event and after they had been referred for treatment. Consequently, it may be that soldiers who experienced a transitory ASR in the heat of the moment were not identified. Thus, the study may be assessing some other difficulty, such as ASD, rather than an ASR. Nevertheless, the Israeli study provides a unique look into the psychological stress experienced by soldiers soon after battle.",

However, an ASR can be meaningful and impactful in a high-stress occupational context, where its occurrence can place an individual at greater risk of injury, imperil the entire team if there are not enough individuals to sustain the safety of the group, or impede completion of a critical mission. Studies of high-demand professions have examined physiological and psychological distortions under stress that might illuminate the nature of acute stress. For example, there are several descriptive studies of police officers involved in shootings in which reactions such as visual or aural distortions, tunnel vision, temporal slowing, and memory distortion are reported (see [10] for a summary). Other studies of police-involved shootings focus on how stress impacts decision-making [11, 12] , an important topic in its own right although one that is beyond the scope of the present paper.",

In contrast, ASRs appear to affect individuals regardless of their mental health history and are considered to be a normal response to a discrete and singular external threat. Symptom duration also appears to differ, with panic attacks resolving within minutes and an ASR resolving over a more variable time frame (from a few minutes to a few days).

We chose this approach because our eight-item measure of possible combat events (e.g., \"believed you would be seriously injured or killed,\" \"felt responsible for the death of a combatant\"), while informative, was not exhaustive and therefore could not be used as a reliable filter. We did confirm, however, that soldiers endorsing a possible ASR reported nearly twice as many combat experiences as those who did not report a possible ASR, and our prevalence estimate increased to 22.8%-or more than 1 in 5-when we restricted our analysis to soldiers reporting at least one of these eight events.

In contrast, if service members were deploying to a conflict with a near-peer adversary [15] , the prevalence of an ASR might be markedly higher. These estimates have practical utility for leaders so that they can anticipate momentary and prolonged gaps in functioning and introduce mitigating strategies accordingly. Behavioral health professionals can play a key role in reminding leaders to consider and plan for such eventualities. If, for example, a 100-person Army company were operating in a high-stress combat environment, it may help leaders to consider that 17 soldiers may experience an ASR, with 8 unable to function for what might be considered a meaningful amount of time.",

Previous research has also found that self-report of experiences during combat may be a valid approach to measurement [16] . Since these data are not reported through medical channels, there is also no way to review military records to validate these reactions. Instead, self-report is currently the most feasible and accurate method for obtaining prevalence estimates. Also, given that there may be perceptual distortions during an ASR, it is possible that soldier estimates of how long they felt their functioning was impeded may be inaccurate. Despite these limitations, the results are based on a relatively robust sample and offer a window into understanding the experience of ASR from the soldier's perspective. A substantial number of soldiers report what may be an ASR, this reaction is not purely fleeting for most, and their team members have an opportunity to respond in the moment. Although clinicians might ideally want to move a service member with an ASR to a relatively safer environment (while still following the principles of Proximity, Immediacy, Expectancy, and Simplicity; [17] ), such an option may not be feasible when the reaction occurs in the middle of a mission where the need to return to functioning is paramount for everyone's safety. Instead, it is particularly important to consider the role that team members can play in mitigating this threat to the individual and team. ). This intervention involves getting the attention of the affected individual, reassuring them that they are not alone, asking them simple facts to trigger automatic cognitive processing, grounding them in the present moment, and directing them to engage in purposeful action. This simple and rapid technique was so well received that the Israel Defense Forces mandated YaHaLOM training for its service members. Initial survey results with 904 Israeli soldiers demonstrated that those who reported receiving YaHaLOM training reported more knowledge about and greater confidence in managing an ASR than those who did not report YaHaLOM training [18\u2022] . Those reporting YaHaLOM training were also less likely to agree that soldiers who develop an ASR are weak and were more likely to agree that anyone could develop an ASR during combat [18\u2022] . Survey results also demonstrated that including a video in training to depict the YaHaLOM steps was associated with better outcomes than training without a video [18\u2022] . Training also moderated the relationship between witnessing an ASR and sub-clinical PTSD [14] . Specifically, soldiers indicating high levels of witnessing ASR in team members were less likely to endorse sub-clinical PTSD if they reported having been trained in YaHaLOM than if they reported they had not been trained [14] . Finally, case studies from the field demonstrated that the intervention could be implemented successfully in the real world [19\u2022\u2022] .",

Theory and research on performance difficulties in high-stakes contexts such as sports and the stage may offer useful insight into conceptualizing ASRs, although such performance contexts entail being evaluated by others rather than exposure to horrific threat [25 \u2022 ]. In addition, future research should assess the impact of iCOVER training in a prospective intervention trial to determine if the training is effective, although anticipating the onset of an acutely stressful event is difficult, and following up with some high-risk teams over time may represent a feasibility challenge. Future research should also verify the estimates of duration in dysfunction associated with an ASR, perhaps through leveraging bodycam footage and audio. Finally, future research should examine the degree to which an ASR-and how it is managed by teammatespredicts subsequent mental health and the way in which facilitating a return to functioning may help offset feelings of frustration and inadequacy that could be harbored by individuals over time.
