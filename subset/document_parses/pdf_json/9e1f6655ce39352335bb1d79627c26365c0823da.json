The explanation remains unclear. Hypotheses fall into two main categories. Either the incidence of stroke has declined during this period, or a higher proportion of patients who have strokes are never reaching stroke services [2] . We reasoned that any change in the spectrum of stroke severity in patients presenting during the pandemic might yield important clues to distinguish between these two possibilities, as follows.",

These are the patients most likely to decide to manage their stroke at home, perhaps for fear of the risk of contracting COVID-19 whilst in hospital. They are the most likely to have their neurological symptoms missed at a time of severe respiratory illness from the virus, or to be turned away from overstretched emergency services rather than being directed into the stroke pathway [4] . Finally, minor stroke symptoms are probably more likely to be overlooked in residents of care homes. On the other hand putative mechanisms for a decline in stroke incidence, such as reduced strain whilst people are not at work or lower levels of pollution [3] , would not necessarily impact on strokes of any particular severity.",

Figure 1 shows the distribution of stroke severities (using the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale) in admissions to our Hyperacute Stroke Unit for two 40-day periods: before the decline in emergency admissions in England [3] (1st February to 12th March, blue triangles) and after it (1st April to 11th May 2020, red circles). The decline in the number of patients admitted with mild strokes (NIHSS \u2264 5) was far more dramatic than was seen for moderate or severe strokes (NIHSS > 5). It seems unlikely that a fall in the true incidence of stroke would have been so strongly biased towards mild strokes, and more plausible that the major factor driving this decline is that patients with mild strokes were no longer reaching our service during the second period.",

The public health message is clear: individuals who think that they may be having a stroke, regardless of symptom severity, are much better off calling for an ambulance than staying at home.
