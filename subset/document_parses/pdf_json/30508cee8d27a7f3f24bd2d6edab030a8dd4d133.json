Each year, adolescents in low-and middle-income countries have an estimated 21 million pregnancies and 12 million of them give birth; 1 pregnancy and childbirth complications are the leading cause of death for girls aged [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] years. 2 Surveys in sub-Saharan Africa find that nearly all adolescent girls who have ever been pregnant are not attending school, with pregnancy cited as the most common reason for dropout. 3 Despite these risks, use of modern family planning methods among adolescents remains low in many places. 4 In the 2016 Demographic and Health Survey, one in four adolescent girls aged 15-19 years in Uganda had begun childbearing, yet nearly half of births to this age group were reported as mistimed or unwanted, a higher proportion than in older women. 5 Women who gave birth more than once as an adolescent increasingly report preferring they had their second child at a later age. 6 Adolescents also have the highest abortion rate among recently sexually active women in Uganda, 7 exposing them to risks associated with unsafe methods of abortion. Only 39% of sexually active girls aged 15-19 years (253 000 out of 648 000) who do not want a child for at least 2 years use modern contraception, leaving six in 10 girls with an unmet need for contraception. 8 Increased efforts are needed to ensure not only that contraception is available but that adolescents can access youthfriendly counselling and services to support their informed choices. Interventions aimed at adolescents still forming their identities and understanding of norms around sexuality and gender may be especially important in contexts where social stigma can be a barrier to contraception uptake. Among this age group, peers can be especially influential on relationships and sexual behaviours, 9 and may be an important barrier or facilitator for access to family planning. However, common interventions such as peer education and youth centres have not been effective at improving adolescents' access to services and changing their behaviour. 10 Behavioural design is a systematic approach to intervention development 11 and a promising strategy to improve sexual and reproductive health-seeking behaviour and outcomes. 12 The approach involves first diagnosing barriers preventing uptake of a behaviour followed by development of tailored solutions. Employing this approach, we designed an intervention to increase adolescent girls' uptake of family planning counselling and services in Uganda. The intervention aimed to address behavioural barriers (Table 1) identified through clinic-based observations and qualitative interviews with married and unmarried adolescents, service providers, community health mobilizers and local nongovernmental organization staff. We refined the intervention through collaboration and testing with users, resulting in a multicomponent health behaviour intervention. For this study we evaluated the impact of the intervention on the number of adolescent clients accepting family planning services and the proportion of total clinic clients who were adolescents.",

Methods We developed an intervention using behavioural design and carried out a stratified, randomized controlled evaluation of the intervention in girls aged 15-19 years. Sexual and reproductive health clinics were randomized into control (56 clinics) and intervention groups (60 clinics). All intervention clinics received the core intervention (materials to create an adolescent-friendly environment and referral cards to give to friends), while a subset of clinics additionally received training in youth-friendly service provision. We collected clinics' routine data on monthly numbers of visits by adults and adolescents over a 15-month baseline and 6-month intervention period, 2018-2020. Findings In multivariate regression analysis we found significant effects of the intervention on primary outcomes in the pooled intervention group compared with control. Mean monthly visits by adolescents increased by 45% (incidence rate ratio, IRR: 1.45; 95% confidence interval, CI: 1.14-1.85), or over five additional adolescent clients per clinic per month. The mean adolescent proportion of total clients improved by 5.3 percentage points (95% CI: 0.02-0.09). Within treatment arms, clinics receiving the training in youth-friendly service provision showed the strongest effects: a 62% increase (IRR: 1.62; 95% CI: 1.21-2.17) in adolescent clients, or over seven additional adolescents per clinic per month, relative to the control group. Conclusion A behavioural change intervention designed to target identified barriers can increase adolescents' uptake of family planning counselling and services.",

The clinics provide counselling, contraceptive insertion, side-effect management and contraceptive removal, and are reimbursed for service costs. Community health mobilizers distribute youth vouchers free to girls and young women under 25 years and sell paid discount vouchers to women of all ages for 2000 Ugandan shillings (about 0.55 United States dollars).

A review of previous studies evaluating the reach of adolescent interventions in low-income settings suggests that many adolescents are not being reached by the sexual and reproductive health programmes intended for them. 10 We received positive feedback during the process evaluation 19 from enthusiastic service providers, community mobilizers and clients, who wanted the intervention to continue. Our experience therefore supports the success of the programme at connecting hard-to-reach adolescent girls to valuable family planning counselling and services, and demonstrates the intervention's acceptability, appropriateness and ease of implementation. Negative stereotypes and social stigma around contraception and sexual relationships can inhibit uptake of family planning. 20 Interventions aimed at adolescents may therefore be especially important. The refer-a-friend card intervention aims to facilitate advice and experience-sharing among peers, and to make visiting clinics for accurate guidance on family planning options less intimidating. The referral cards, staff nametags and clinic posters aim to make girls feel invited and welcome at facilities, a sentiment expressed by girls during process evaluation interviews.",

[21] [22] [23] [24] Thus our findings may suggest the importance of youth-friendly service provision when paired with interventions to facilitate adolescent demand for and access to clinic services. It should be noted that youth-friendly services training was previously conducted in 2017 for network clinics entering the youth voucher programme (about one third of clinics), so it is possible that a subset of service providers in all study arms had earlier exposure to the training.",

Such clinics may be better prepared for peer referral, with staff more experienced in provision of youth services. Although not a statistically significant effect, the intervention's positive interaction with vouchers suggests that efforts meant to close gaps between intentions and actions and generate demand for services would be best paired with measures to increase affordability. Indeed, service providers in clinics without youth vouchers reported that many girls coming in for counselling could not afford to pay for their desired family planning methods. However, our results suggest a significant impact of the intervention on uptake even when services cannot be offered for free.",

Pre-intervention period was November 2018 to January 2020. Adolescent family planning, Uganda Sara Flanagan et al. and negatively. However, we found no evidence that the effects differed between clinics in intervention and control groups. Schools remained closed in Uganda from March 2020 throughout the study period. Free time and restricted movement due to transport shutdowns or close parental supervision may have affected both adolescents' need for and ability to access family planning services. Furthermore, both the Ugandan health ministry and Marie Stopes Uganda increased their outreach services to adolescents during the study period, pairing family planning messaging with COVID-19 posters and radio broadcasts with advice to the public. Such escalated efforts across the country may have attenuated the intervention's effect. Social distancing restrictions may also have led to limited opportunities for referral of a friend. Stronger effects observed during the early months of implementation suggest the pandemic may have weakened average intervention effects. Finally, although introducing new data reporting methods is difficult under normal circumstances, operational challenges during the pandemic context may have further contributed to low reporting rates of the refer-a-friend cards distributed and redeemed by intervention clinics. These low reporting rates are an unfortunate limitation to assessing the full extent of participation in the programme beyond the routine service data collected. When possible, reporting procedures should be adapted to the reality of clinic work, to facilitate monitoring of adherence to the intervention. CI: confidence interval; IRR: incidence rate ratio (exponentiated regression coefficients); NA: not applicable. Notes: We estimated regression models with robust standard errors and adjusted for clustering by facility. All models controlled for type of clinic vouchers used (youth vouchers, paid vouchers or no vouchers), region, strata used for randomization, and time fixed effects (see the authors' data repository). 14 Core facilities received the intervention package (adolescent peer-referral system and family planning clinic welcome materials); core-plus facilities received the intervention package and training on provision of youth-friendly services. Another limitation is that routine service reporting did not record how many adolescents received family planning counselling without uptake of a contraceptive method; the primary outcomes therefore reflect family planning uptake only. Average intervention effects of over five new adolescent family planning clients per clinic per month suggests that nearly 2000 additional girls were served across six implementation months. Yet the process evaluation revealed that many girls redeemed refer-a-friend cards for wristbands and counselling without taking up contraception. Underreported card redemptions suggest that at least twice as many adolescents may have benefited from counselling alone. Considering that many adolescents who are not yet sexually active are likely to become sexually active soon, early counselling may be a gateway to accessing family planning services once needed. Girls remarked on the value of the counselling to them and their friends, and expressed their intention to eventually return for services. No evidence from the process evaluation suggests girls felt pressured into taking up family planning when redeeming their refer-a-friend card for wristbands. The greater number of cards redeemed compared with the number of clients served further suggests the intervention did not undermine the girls' choices and actions. Unfortunately, we were unable to study whether the intervention influenced the distribution of contraceptive methods taken up by adolescents because the routine service data did not disaggregate this variable by age group.",

While behavioural interventions tailored to a specific context are not always generalizable, the behavioural design approach itself is a generalizable and robust process to intervention development. The behavioural diagnosis underlying this intervention identified barriers to adoles-cent uptake that may be relevant beyond the study network and beyond Uganda, suggesting these designs might be adapted to similar settings where family planning services are available but similar barriers inhibit girls' access. \u25a0 ",
