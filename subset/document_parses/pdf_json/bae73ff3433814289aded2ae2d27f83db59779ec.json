It can be difficult to track individual-level characteristics and behaviors, particularly as they are dynamic and changing over time, as they relate to incident disease.

In the absence of such testing, recent evidence suggests that symptoms themselves may be useful markers of SARS-CoV-2 infection [9] . While the virus may be asymptomatic, a variety of symptom clusters associated with the disease have been identified, often including fever, but ranging from typical respiratory symptoms to gastrointestinal afflictions to somewhat idiosyncratic findings such as anosmia/ageusia and conjunctivitis [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] . In the past, ascertainment of viral symptoms has relied on assessments of those seeking medical care or retrospective surveys that may be prone to recall bias. Given the current near-ubiquity of smartphones and use of related mobile apps, technology is now available to regularly and repeatedly query large numbers of individuals over time, providing access to symptom development as it arises. Although monitoring for viral symptoms may be neither sufficiently sensitive nor specific for SARS-CoV-2 infection, these outcomes are, by their nature, inherently experienced by the individual, potentially providing valuable information that may be best leveraged by modern mobile technology.",

Pooled logistic regression models were used to identify factors associated with incident symptoms, potentially including baseline characteristics (demographics, medical conditions, habits, and behaviors related to viral infection risk such as hand hygiene), and time-updated information from daily and weekly surveys. Exposures that expected to influence the risk of viral infection that would then manifest as future symptoms several days later were evaluated using survey data for 6-12 days earlier.

In response, tremendous investment and efforts are being dedicated to enhance the availability of testing [27] , identify effective therapies [28] , and ultimately to develop a vaccine [29] . Although these remedies are being pursued at an unprecedented pace, the number of infections and deaths continues to grow, and, even after these new technologies, drugs, and vaccines are developed, additional time will be required to disseminate them. While studies of hospitalized patients are valuable, ultimately the characteristics, behaviors, and exposures of individuals in the general community associated with the development of viral symptoms can be helpful in several ways: to identify those at highest risk of developing these symptoms, which may help prioritize protecting the most vulnerable; to provide novel insights regarding the biology of current viral disease; and ideally to identify low-risk and modifiable behaviors that individuals might practice or avoid to reduce their own individual-level risk.",

            "text": "Clearly, self-reported symptoms of a viral infection do not equal SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, the specific viral symptoms repeatedly queried in our population were developed based on available evidence regarding the nature of SARS-CoV-2 infection [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] , and similar viral diseases, including the common cold and influenza for example, very likely share common properties related to an individual's susceptibility to infection [30] . In addition, independent of commonalities across easily transmissible viral diseases, there are shared Somewhat less n/a n/a, n/a n/a Much less n/a n/a, n/a n/a phenomena related to the human immune system's general vulnerability to viral infection [31] . Finally, due to the lack of universal testing, there is some evidence that surveillance for viral symptoms may itself have several advantages, often reflecting, either directly or indirectly, underlying COVID-19 disease [9, 32, 33] . The higher incidence of viral symptoms among women in our cohort runs counter to the prevailing evidence that men are at higher risk of both SARS-CoV-2 infection and related morbidity and mortality [34, 35] . Indeed, population-based studies examining seropositivity for antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 have generally failed to demonstrate any differences by biological sex [36, 37] . While this may suggest the viral symptoms detected by the current study fail to capture patterns most relevant to SARS-CoV-2, these differences may have occurred because our models adjusted for related mediators (such as smoking) [38] or because women are either more likely to experience or report more mild symptoms. Previous communitybased studies often adjust or weight for sex distributions based on the population, which can often hinder a direct assessment of biological sex as a predictor itself [33, 39] . Anemia and hypertension as risk factors are consistent with the general notion that other systemic comorbidities enhance the susceptibility to viral infection. While anemia may be a marker of general, non-specific disease, hypertension, not generally considered a risk factor for infectious diseases, has emerged as a consistent predictor of SARS-CoV-2 infection and associated complications [4] [5] [6] [7] . The reasons for this are unclear, although angiotensin-converting-enzyme-2 (ACE2)-dependent cellular entry of the virus has been posited as a biologically plausible mechanism, assuming some connection with ACE2-dysregulation that is also associated with hypertension [40, 41] . While optimizing blood pressure control reduces overall morbidity and mortality [42] , the consequences on incident viral infection have not yet been fully elucidated.",

The impact of smoking on the risk of SARS-CoV-2 has been difficult to study, as reliance on hospitalization data fails to provide a foundational study base to make comparisons. Conflicting data on the subject exists, with some evidence that smokers may have a lower risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and other evidence they may experience a higher risk [43] -the great majority of these studies rely on data among those already infected rather than providing information from cohort studies that include a geographically heterogenous cohort such as ours. Smoking may reduce the effectiveness of the immune response and may also upregulate ACE2, rendering individuals more prone to infection [44] . Or this observation may be related to an overall greater propensity to the symptoms of interest in the current study, rather than SARS-CoV-2 infection per se. The observation that sick household contacts predicted incident symptoms may provide evidence that these symptoms were in fact often due to a transmissible disease. For example, although the current analyses excluded those with prevalent symptoms (which reduces the chance symptoms arose from some chronic, ever-present, problem), shared symptoms within a household may have represented some common exposure or predisposition, such as an allergy-however, household symptoms preceding participant symptoms arose as a statistically significant predictor of incident symptoms, supporting viral infections as a culprit. Although physical distancing as a method to mitigate spread of infection is supported by the general understanding of the nature of infectious diseases, particularly respiratory viruses, our observation from prospective, repeatedly updated, individual-level data that the number of human to human physical interactions predicted viral symptoms may provide useful evidence in support of physical distancing.",

We utilized the MacArthur subjective social status ladder as a validated single-item question to capture socioeconomic status [19, 20] . A higher self-perceived social status may influence viral infection risk in several ways: more education may translate into a better understanding of disease risks and healthy behaviors, and employment among those of a higher socioeconomic status may be more flexible and less often involve high-risk environments. Conversely, stress and the allostatic load related to social determinants of health among those with a lower subjective social status may adversely affect the immune response to infection [45] . Regular exercise is an established means to improve immune function and the response to viral infection [46] , now with evidence for beneficial effects specifically in the COVID-19 era. We recognize that sanitizing one's phone as a protective factor may simply serve as a marker of more fastidious behaviors to minimize risk in general, but the ubiquity and frequent use of the smartphone, likely while shopping, while at work, and while interacting with others, would seem to make it a potentially potent fomite that could result in repeated exposure throughout the day and into the home.",

Of note, the majority of statistically significant findings did exhibit particularly small p values that would have withstood even the most conservative multiple hypothesis testing adjustment (such as Bonferroni), but, for the reasons described above, we do not believe this would be appropriate as it would risk reclassifying true positives as false positives. These are also standard and well-accepted approaches to this sort of analysis [24] .",

            "text": "Our study has several important limitations. The outcome of interest was viral symptoms, which relied on self-report. These findings therefore do not directly reflect any particular disease, including infection with SARS-CoV-2. Indeed, while we selected fever as a required symptom in hopes of capturing infection and at least one other symptom known to be associated with SARS-CoV-2 to help with specificity, the symptoms described are more applicable to respiratory viruses in general and could also occur outside the realm of infection. Importantly, we were able to leverage the prospective nature of our study with repeated assessments and exclude those with prevalent symptoms at baseline, which should help mitigate against contamination by those with chronic and non-infectious conditions. Some investigators have proposed and validated the creation of symptom-based scores for the accurate inference of COVID-19 [47] , and future similar efforts may be able to harness the relative accessibility of patient or research participant self-report without reliance on biological assays. Multiple studies have sought to identify particular symptoms or combinations of symptoms most indicative of SARS-CoV-2 infection [14, 25, 32, 33, 47] -while the symptoms we employed generally match those associated with the disease in these studies, variability in populations and study design currently preclude the identification of an optimal approach to strike the intended balance regarding sensitivity versus specificity in such longitudinal cohort studies. Indeed, there is evidence the evolving nature of COVID-19 may produce variable manifestations over time, potentially hindering attempts to accurately characterize a true diagnosis by specific symptoms alone [48] . It is important to emphasize that we incorporated information into the study as it arose from the medical literature, such as (as described in the methods) gastrointestinal symptoms, loss of taste and smell, and eye symptoms, soon after they were reported in reputable sources-therefore, not every symptoms was assessed at baseline, which could have led to under-ascertainment of SARS-CoV-2-related symptoms in some. However, those updates were incorporated into both baseline and daily surveys for all participants as they arose. As the study required smartphone use, it is possible our population represents a more technically savvy and perhaps more highly educated and affluent group than the general population. However, this would primarily limit generalizability and should not serve as a threat to internal validity. We assumed that the absence of a completed daily survey represented an absence of symptoms, which may have resulted in a loss of power to detect some relationships but addressed missing data in a fashion that did not risk creating spurious false positive associations. In addition, the participants were fairly geographically diverse, representing every state in the US and multiple countries. Although less than 80% of the study participants were non-Hispanic white, African American representation was relatively poor. Finally, although the data were collected prospectively and in a time-updated fashion, the study was observational, prone to residual and unmeasured confounding that should temper assumptions of causal effects.",
