A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t 2 ABSTRACT Defining the duration of infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 has major implications for public health and infection control practice in healthcare facilities. Early in the pandemic, most hospitals required two negative RT-PCR tests before discontinuing isolation in patients with Covid-19. Many patients, however, have persistently positive RT-PCR tests for weeks to months following clinical recovery and multiple studies now indicate that persistently positive RT-PCRs generally do not reflect replication-competent virus.",

Attempts to culture virus from upper respiratory specimens were unsuccessful when PCR Ct values were higher than 35 (i.e., a low but detectable range of viral nucleic acid). Ct values from upper respiratory specimens were high following recovery from clinical illness, suggesting viral debris rather than replication-competent virus. Lastly, they reported that they have not cultured infectious virus from urine or from feces, suggesting these sources pose minimal risk of transmission particularly following hand hygiene. Note, however, that investigators have been able to culture infectious virus from feces in at least one patient.

One case report from Taiwan, for example, noted infectious shedding by viral cell culture in the sputum 18 days after symptom onset in a patient with a mild febrile illness.

PCR tests were positive for up to 20 days after symptom onset, but viable virus could not be cultured after day 8. In the second analysis, 11 patients in whom daily cultures were attempted were negative by day 10.[47] Canadian investigators provided similar results from an analysis of 90 PCRpositive samples, including nasopharyngeal swabs and endotracheal aspirates, taken through 21 days after symptom onset.[48] Virus could not be cultured after 8 days from symptom onset or when Ct values were greater than 24. The probability of successfully culturing SARS-CoV-2 was highest between days 1-5 and peaked at day 3. Every unit increase in Ct value was associated with a decrease in the odds of successfully culturing virus by 32%. In an analysis of hospitalized patients with Covid-19 in Singapore, viral culture was positive from respiratory samples in 14 of 73 patients.[49] Viral culture was unsuccessful in all samples with Ct values >30, and 90% of samples taken after day 14 from symptom onset had Ct values >30. A study from the Netherlands specifically focused on patients with severe illness, including immunocompromised patients.[50] Of the 129 patients in the study, 69% were in intensive care units, 31% were in non-critical care units (most of whom required supplemental oxygen), 23% were immunosuppressed.

Viral cell culture was unsuccessful in all cases; furthermore, full-length genomes could not be sequenced in any cases, suggesting genome degradation. Similarly, the Korean CDC reported on epidemiologic and contact tracing for 285 patients who recovered from Covid-19, tested negative, and then tested positive again by PCR.[55] On average, the re-positive test occurred 45 days after initial symptom onset (range 8-82 days). Retesting was done in 37.5% of patients because of new symptoms such as cough or sore throat. Viral cell culture testing was done in 108 repositive cases, and all were negative. PCR Ct values were >30 in 89.5% of cases, suggesting that the negative-to-positive phenomenon represents sampling variability near the assay limit of detection.
