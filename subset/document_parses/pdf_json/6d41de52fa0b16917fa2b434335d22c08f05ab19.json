For this reason, a rapid alternative diagnostic option should be introduced as an automated detection method to prevent COVID-19 spreading among individuals. This article proposes multi-objective optimization and a deep-learning methodology for the detection of infected coronavirus patients with X-rays. J48 decision tree method classifies the deep characteristics of affected X-ray corona images to detect the contaminated patients effectively. Eleven different convolutional neuronal network-based (CNN) models were developed in this study to detect infected patients with coronavirus pneumonia using X-ray images (AlexNet, VGG16, VGG19, GoogleNet, ResNet18, ResNet500, ResNet101, InceptionV3, InceptionResNetV2, DenseNet201 and Xception-Net). In addition, the parameters of the CNN profound learning model are described using an emperor penguin optimizer with several objectives (MOEPO). A broad review reveals that the proposed model can categorise the X-ray images at the correct rates of precision, accuracy, recall, specificity and F1-score. Extensive test results show that the proposed model outperforms competitive models with well-known efficiency metrics. The proposed model is, therefore, useful for the realtime classification of X-ray chest images of COVID-19 disease.",

            "text": "Respiratory transmission from person to person caused the rapid spread of the disease. The signs of infection include respiratory problems, fatigue, cough and dyspnea. Severe acute respiratory syndromes, septic shock, multi-organ failure and death are more severely affected by the disease [6] . Men have been found to be sicker than women and children aged 0-9 years of age have no death [7] . In cases of COVID-19 pneumonia, respiratory levels were shown to be higher than in people with health [8] . Even with the increasing demand for intensive care facilities in many developed countries, the health system has come to a standstill. The diagnosis of COVID-19 should be confirmed as a key indicator for reverse transcription polymerase or hospitalisation by gene sequencing for respiratory or blood samples, as stated by the Chinese government. The current public health emergency causes the low sensitivity of the RT-PCR to obstruct the detection and treatment of many COVID-19 patients. Moreover, because of the extremely infectious nature of the virus, a wider population is at risk of infection [9] . The diagnoses now include all the individuals who display the common chest pneumonia pattern COVID-19 instead of the patients who wait for positive virus tests. This method allows authorities to isolate and treat patients quicker. Some patients survive from irreversible lung failure even though death does not occur at COVID-19. COVID-19 also opens holes in the lungs like the SARS according to the World Health Organisation, giving them a 'honeycomb-like appearance' [7]. One of the methods used to treat pneumonia is the computed chest tomography (CT). Automated image analysis tools for the detection, quantification and surveillance of corona virus were developed on the basis of artificial intelligence (AI) and to differentiate between patients with coronavirus and disease free [10] . In a Fei et al. research [11] , a deep-learning system was developed to automatically segment all lung and infection places using chest CT. Xiaowei et al. [12] aimed at developing an early model for the diagnosis, using CT images and in-depth education techniques, of COVID-19 pneumonia and influenza-A viral pneumonia in a stable situation. In the Shuai et al. [13] research, they developed a deep-learning system based on the COVID-19 radiographic changes of images taken from the CT that can draw out the graphical characteristics of COVID-19 before pathogenic testing, thus saving crucial time for the diagnosis of the disease. Hamimi's [14] analysis of MERS-CoV found that characteristics such as pneumonia can be present in the chest X-ray and CT. Data-mining techniques were used in the Xuanyang et al. research [15] to differentiate between SARS and conventional pneumonia based on X-ray images. On 41 COVID-19 patients, Huang et al. [16] identified the clinical characteristics, which indicate that cough, heavy, myalgia, or fatigue were typical onset symptoms. Both 41 patients had pneumonia and the chest CT test was anomalous. The first proof of human COVID-19 transmission was found at the University of Hong Kong by the Kok-KH team [17] . Zhao et al. [18] proposed a mathematical model to estimate the real numbers of cases reported in COVID-19 during the first half of January 2020. They concluded that the number of cases not reported was 469 from 1 to 15 January 2020. They also announced that after 17 January 2020, cases increased 21-fold. Nishiura et al. [19] suggested a model prediction of the COVID-19 infection rate in Wuhan, China on 29-31 January 2020 based on data from 565, Japanese citizens evacuated from Wuhan. They assume that the predicted rate is 9.5% and the mortality rate is from 0.3 to 0.6%. However, the number of Japanese people evacuated from Wuhan is limited and insufficient to estimate infection and death. Tang et al. [20] proposed a mathematical model to assess the probability of transmission for COVID-19. They concluded that 6.47 simple reproductions could take place. It also estimated the number of confirmed cases in 7 days (23-29 January 2020). Moreover, they expected the best possible outcome after 2 weeks (from 23 January 2020). The data for estimating sustainable human-to-human transmission of COVID-19 from 47 patients were used in [21] . The author concluded that 0.4 is transmitted, but that 0.012 is transmitted if the time for hospitalisation effects is half the time the results are tested. The authors presented a model of an assessment of risk of death for COVID-19 in [22] . The estimates for two different cases are 5.1% and 8.4%. The reproductive number for both scenarios was also measured at 2.1 and 3.2. Schemes have shown that a COVID-19 X-ray pandemic could occur to scan the body for fractures, bone dislocation, lung infections, pneumonia, and tumours. CT scanning is a kind of state-of-the-art X-ray device that explores the very soft nature and transparency of the active part of the body of soft internal tissues and organs [23] . Radiation is easier, stronger, more effective and less hazardous than CT. If COVID-19 pneumonia is not recognised and treated quickly, mortality can increase.",

This huddling behaviour is the unique characteristic as observed in these social animals during foraging. Hence, in the mathematical model, the prime objective will be to identify an effective mover from the swarm. To achieve this, the distances between Emperor Penguins (EPs) (Z ep ) are calculated followed by their temperature profile (T mp ) .

J48 is selected by prominence and accuracy in results from the decision tree algorithms for COVID-19 a (2) recognition. This is an extension of ID3 (Iterative Dichotomiser 3). Additional features of J48 include (a) derivation of rules, (b) pruning of trees, (c) incompleted accounts and (d) continuous attributes. The continuous and categorical analysis of data constitutes one of the best grading algorithms. The main aim is to divide the data into a uniform class, to predict as much as possible of the variables. J48 allows classification based on either the rules defined or a decision-tab. It aims to reduce impurity or data volatility. The list of attributes for the control of continuous attributes is divided by a threshold and separated by those below and below or equal to threshold. However, it was called \"?\" for missing values. These missing values were not included in entropy and gain calculation. The algorithm consists of collecting (classified) training data. A decision tree is thus generated as an output where every leaf node is a decision and a test a non-leaf node. When the root node has been tested for leaf node testing paths, a leaf node will be shown whether the variable belongs or not. After the tree is built, the tree is used to classify the tuple data in any database tuple. J48 does not know the missing values when a tree is formed. The values of this object can be determined by the established attribute value in other documents. This creates a top-down forest in the classification model. It uses uniform criteria of data division. The knowledge gain of each attribute is measured according to entropy. The most standardised characteristic is chosen for decision making. Then, a root is selected for the best attribute of the next recurrently constructed sub-trees.",

The chest X-ray images used for simulation purposes are collected from the GitHub and Kaggle repositories, for coronavirus identification using deep features and J48 approach. The extraction is done using 11 pretrained CNN models and individually supplied them for J48 classification and MOEPO algorithm. Statistical research is conducted to select the best classification pattern. ResNet101 plus J48 classification model statistical performance is better than the other ten competitor models. ",
