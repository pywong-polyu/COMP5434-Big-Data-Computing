This reflects their increased attention towards their nutrition, with renewed interest for non-conventional diets such as Biologically Appropriate Raw Food/ Bones and Raw Food in United States (BARF) or homemade. In previous studies, owners feeding their dog non-conventional diets reported lower levels of trust in veterinary advice. The aim of the study was to identify differences in lifestyle between owners feeding dogs non-conventional diets and those feeding conventional diets (i.e., dry/wet pet food) to give further insight for improving communication between veterinarians and owners.",

Thirty-eight percent of the survey respondents stated that their dogs were fed exclusively with non-conventional diets, while 55% declared using conventional diets alone (not considering treats). The study canine population was for the most part neutered (63%) and purebred (68%). Amongst owners feeding conventional diets exclusively, 47% determined how much food to feed by consulting the feeding guidelines on the packaging, and only 28% said that the amount of food was prescribed by their veterinarian or veterinary nurse. Out of the participants feeding non-conventional diets, 65% declared that the information for formulating the recipes was gathered on the internet or in non-veterinary books. When compared with owners feeding exclusively conventional diets, those feeding non-conventional diets were living more frequently outside the metropole of Paris, had fewer children (0.23 \u00b1 0.57 vs 0.37 \u00b1 0.78; p = 0.03) and had more frequently other animals. They also dewormed less often their pets, walked their dog more each day (91 vs 78%; p < 0.001) and without leash for more than 6 h per week (46 vs 31%; p = 0.003).",

These numbers represent a growing market for the pet food industry which invests continuously in new products trying to meet the preferences of pet-owners. The latter's expectations have evolved rapidly in recent Open Access *Correspondence: sa.hoummady@gmail.com 1 Universit\u00e9 Paris-Est, Ecole Nationale V\u00e9t\u00e9rinaire d' Alfort, UMES, 7 avenue du G\u00e9n\u00e9ral de Gaulle, 94704 Maisons-Alfort, France Full list of author information is available at the end of the article years (e.g., novel vision of \"natural\" dog food, increase in Biologically Appropriate Raw Food/prey model diets). In this context, to attract consumers, marketing professionals are more and more interested in the owners' perception [3] . Some marketing ploys may bias the owner's perception of the nutritional quality of the chosen diet: a recent study about the Italian pet food buyers, reported that the presence of \"natural\" ingredients was considered as an important indicator of pet food quality from pet owners point of view [21] . On the other hand, there is an increasing interest of owners about nutrition trends like \"grain free\", \"homemade\", \"raw food\" or \"vegetarian\" diets for dogs. According to a survey study in Englishspeaking countries (Australia, Canada, New Zealand, UK and USA) concerning canine feeding practices by owners between 2008 and 2018, the proportion of dogs fed with inclusion of non-conventional diets like home-made diets or vegetarian appears to be increasing [6] . These changes in feeding practices are raising concerns about microbiological risks regarding owners and dogs when raw products are involved [19] . Furthermore, analysis of these recipes frequently showed several nutrients below recommendations [17] which can be extremely dangerous for some pets (Kitten, puppy, senior animals, cardiac dogs). Recently grain free diets has been linked to cardiac disease [1] . Pet nutrition is the centre of owner preoccupation and veterinarian face hardly to multiple question between science and marketing. Because the aforementioned study by Dodd et al. [6] showed different results from one country to another, conducting surveys in different countries will be a useful tool to improve veterinary education in the field of nutrition. In absence of information from veterinarians, owners will search on the internet [13, 14] . Communication is a cornerstone of nutrition consultation but the profile of owners feeding dogs non-conventional diets (NCD) compared to profile of owners feeding dogs with conventional diets (CD) (i.e., dry/wet pet food) has not been clearly defined and is essential for good veterinarian-client communication.",

            "text": "The present study is the first to compare lifestyles of owners and dogs according to the dog's diet in France. Moreover, there are very few data about the habits of French pet owners in terms of owner food choice for their dogs [4] . Last, but not least, this survey is focused on the Internet population, which is a highly active population as far as BARF and raw diets are concerned but still under-researched. Information collected in this study highlights differences between owners/dogs using NCD versus owners using CD. Owners using NCD lived more frequently outside of the metropole of Paris, had fewer children, and dewormed less than owners using CD. These results are consistent with the analysis by Morgan et al., [14] , where pet owners who fed raw animal products were in majority without child (61%) and only 28% lived in an urban area. But in contrast to Morgan et al. [14] results, owners using NCD were mostly 40 years or younger. This difference can be explained by the earlier presence of the trend of raw diets and homemade food in the US compared with France or an age population more present on internet (40 years or younger). This difference must be more studied in future survey. The present study results draw a profile of a home in a residential setting, less urban, and a family more focused on \"nature\". It would be interesting to explore the compliance of these owners with veterinary counselling or dog vaccination. It may well be those owners using NCD vaccinate less their dogs due to lack of veterinary trust, as observed in Morgan studies, with a tendency of pet owners feeding raw products less likely to vaccinate and deworm. This assumption agrees with the origin of the recipes used by owners using NCD. In our study, only 14 owners using NCD (9%) reported a veterinary recipe prescribed for the dog, 14 owners used a NCD recipe found in a veterinary book and the majority (83%) used recipes from the Internet or non-veterinary books, or personal prescription. Another online survey reported similar results, with only 14% of the interviewed people having asked a veterinarian or a nutrition-trained expert for advice for raw meatbased diets [13] . For these owners, veterinarians were not the first source of information about nutrition, which confirms the important role of other sources of information like the Internet [14] . When compared with owners using CD, the first source of information about food quantity was the manufacturer (47%), and veterinarians were the second (28%). This proportion of owners using veterinarian information, even if higher for owners using CD, is still low and in accordance with observations of other surveys [10, 12, 14] . There is a need of increased veterinarian communication about nutrition as suggested in a recent publication [7] , especially on the Internet, where owners are searching information. This naturally suggests a requirement for more nutrition training in veterinary schools to prepare students [2] and a better vet communication about their ability in canine nutrition. This lack of trust regarding veterinarians may also have implications for animal and public health. Indeed, raw homemade food are more and more present on the market and this dietary practice is known to be associated with microbiological risks both for pets and their owners [5, 19] . Studies have reported mineral deficiencies in home-prepared diets, mainly calcium (Dillitzer et al., 2011; [18] . The Dillitzer study reported in 2011 that 60% of bone and raw food ration had major nutrient imbalances. The present study's results confirm this danger, with only 28% of the French online respondents feeding NCD already using a mineral and/or vitamin supplement to balance their recipe. The improvement of communication regarding nutrition between veterinarians and owners using NCD may be a benefit to dogs' health with an appropriate modification of the NCD if imbalanced. In order to improve communication, there is a need to better understand the audience (NCD owners in the present case). This survey helps to better define the characteristics of NCD French dog owners. Compared to owners using CD, they had more frequently other animals at home, provided more often daily access to the outside to their dogs (outside of the garden and the house), and walked them more frequently off-leash for more than 6 h per week (which may be associated with a more rural lifestyle). These life-conditions provide an enriched environment for dogs [22] and closer to the species' ethological needs. These observations may relate with the fact that the majority of owners using NCD lived outside the metropole of Paris, but even in an urban environment, there is possibility to walk a dog each day. Another hypothesis is the new trend to \"natural foods\", which takes inspiration from the human food marketing [15] . According to Moscato and Machin [15] , in human marketing the term \"natural\" is associated with authenticity, and with the idea of being a good mother. The \"natural\" adjective may help to simplify food decision [11, 15] by luring consumers into purchasing the idea of some health-giving properties. The trend \"back to nature\" is also present in pet foods, with an increased demand for this sector and a market corresponding to 25% of the total value of the pet food market in the US in 2016 [20] . This can be explained by the humanization of pets and the fact that owners transposed their own dietary choice for \"natural food\" on their dogs. Two common reasons for choosing raw diets are their perception as \"more natural\" and \"healthier\" [14] . In terms of communication, dogs are often compared to wolves as model of wild canids eating natural food. The comparison between dogs and wolves is very present in the online community, which may explain a choice of dog breeds with higher body weight for owners using NCD. The major argument is that, since wolves are dogs' ancestors, food found in wild conditions by the former is supposedly optimal for a dog. This frequent comparison may have led owners using NCD to take care of ethological needs (more off-leash walk, more often daily access to the outside) of their dogs more carefully than owners using CD because of comparison with wolf lifestyle (in group, living outside, \u2026). To explore this hypothesis, it will be mandatory to compare the ethological knowledge of owners using NCD versus owners using CD. Ethology could be a promising approach angle to discuss nutrition with owners using NCD rather than focusing only on canine dietary requirements if this hypothesis is confirmed.",

Results showed that the majority of owners feeding NCD lived outside the metropole of Paris, had fewer children but more animals at home, dewormed less frequently their dogs, had dogs with higher body weight, took them more often on a walk and left dogs off-leash more than 6 h per week. Moreover, this study shows that veterinarians are rarely consulted as a source of advice by owners using NCD, which may indicate a lack of trust in French veterinarians on the importance of pet nutrition or a lack of veterinarian's communication regarding their nutrition competencies. These results may help to better understand these populations of owners and improve communication with veterinarians about nutrition.",

The first section concerned dog and family profile (age, postal code, number of people in the family, number of children, profession, age of the dog, neutered status, neutering age, breed, health condition, body condition according to owners, change in weight over time, muscular status). A second section focused on lifestyle (deworming, level of activity according to owners, walk time, sport activity with the dog, habitat of the dog, time spent playing with the dog, presence of other animals and interactions). A third part was about toys and resting places. The fourth part was focused on nutrition (type of diet, amount fed, number of meals, place to buy food, category of the food, composition of the diet). The last part was about the dog's relationship to their diet (where is presented the diet, how accurate is the amount fed, is another dog present, time to finish the meal, \u2026). A last question was about the authorisation to use data. The questionnaire is present in the supplementary files (See Additional file 1 and Additional file 2).",

The household place was divided between \"French metropole area of Paris\" and \"Rest of France\" because of higher occurrence of the former. The age of owners was split at 40 years to compare with the results by [14] where 39 percent of Raw animal product feeders were 40 years of age or younger in United State population. Owner aging 40 years and older may have different belief in nutritional requirement which should be studied in other survey. The different homemade diets have been grouped as NCD (including commercial BARF). Information about the recipes for NCD was mostly imprecise (lack of information about the amounts of the single ingredients) and did not allow a study of the diet's nutritional adequacy. The body index reported by owners was not taken into consideration as owners may have used different criteria, not comparable with the standardised approach used during veterinary consultations, in estimating their dogs' body condition leading to a result of difficult interpretation [23] .",
