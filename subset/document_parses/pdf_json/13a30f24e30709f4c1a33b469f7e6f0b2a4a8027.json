The pandemic and its fallout have laid bare deep-seated social and economic inequalities with marginalised groups being at greater risk of infection and being disproportionately affected by containment measures and their socioeconomic consequences. Stigma is a central element to such inequalities but remains largely overlooked in the debate on the response to COVID-19, including in LMICs. Yet we know from experiences with other infectious diseases such as HIV/AIDS and Ebola that disease-related stigma is detrimental to halting and controlling pandemics and achieving equitable development. Emerging evidence suggests that stigma associated with COVID-19 is already taking hold. This paper assesses potential driving factors of COVID-19-related stigma, and how this intersects with existing stigma fault lines and explores mechanisms through which COVID-19-related stigma may be counteracted, with a focus on LMICs.",

It is becoming increasingly clear that the pandemic's consequences are likely to be even graver in many low-and middle-income countries (LMICs). Higher transmissibility due to overcrowding in densely populated areas, larger household sizes and poor quality of water and sanitation, higher infection-to-case ratios due to high prevalence of comorbidities such as hypertension and diabetes, and higher fatality rates due to lack of health care capacity contribute to more severe health consequences in LMICs (Dahab et al. 2020) . Lockdown measures and restrictions on movement that have been put in place to quell infection rates also have far-reaching adverse effects. Large proportions of the workforce in the informal labour market are left without any source of income and informal supply chains are disrupted (Kelley et al. 2020) . Negative health and economic consequences are exacerbated by limited coverage of social protection . Lack of income support makes it more difficult to adhere to physical distancing by foregoing work outside the home. Estimates suggest that the number of people expected to fall into extreme poverty ranges anywhere between 80 and 395 million (Sumner et al. 2020) .",

However, as experiences with HIV/AIDS, Ebola, cholera and other transmissible diseases have highlighted, responses to pandemics often suffer from a narrow biomedical focus and overlook the social, economic, political and cultural contexts in which they take place (Kelley et al. 2020) . This limits understandings of how disease might spread, who is affected and how, and how policies should be shaped to offer the most effective and equitable response. This is no different for COVID-19: the sheer scale of the pandemic, the speed at which it continues to spread and the urgency with which response measures are being put in place means that socioeconomic dynamics and inequities receive relatively little attention (Kelley et al. 2020) . Moreover, LMICs' replication of policies that originate from high-income countries call into question the extent to which such policies are adequately contextualised and pay attention to existing patterns of socioeconomic injustice (Barnett-Howell and Mobarak 2020; SSHAP 2020).",

Long-standing research on HIV (Mahajan et al. 2008; Castro and Farmer 2005) and neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) (Hofstraat and van Brakel 2016) as well as more recent experiences with Ebola (Karamouzian and Hategekimana 2014) indicate that stigma is experienced by those being affected by disease (both directly or indirectly, such as survivors or health workers) or by groups that may be seen as 'vehicles' for, or most structurally vulnerable to, infection. Stigma also intensifies along fault lines such as class, age, gender and race (Lerman et al. 2017) . Stigma is detrimental to halting and controlling pandemics, to support societies' recovery from a pandemic, and achieving equitable development. It puts up barriers to accessing health care and social services, impedes healthseeking behaviour, undermines adherence to treatment and leads to social exclusion, discrimination, mental distress and-in some cases-violence (Rohrwerder 2018; Stangl et al. 2019; Roelen 2020) . Although COVID-19 is still relatively new, the many unknowns and uncertainties associated with this 'newness' may give rise to fear that can in turn fuel stereotyping and stigmatisation (WHO 2020). Indeed, stigmatisation of those infected with or having survived the virus as well as health workers who face high exposure is already mounting (Bagcchi 2020; United Nations 2020a; Taylor 2020) .",

Stigma represents a characteristic that is different from 'normal' and triggers disapproval or devaluation in certain social contexts (Bos et al. 2013; Link and Phelan 2001) with those being stigmatised somehow deemed to be less human (Goffman 1963) . Stigmatisation constitutes others' responses to stigma and can be overt, such as avoidance and humiliation, as well as more subtle, including lack of eye contact (Bos et al. 2013 ). This, in turn, interacts with 'potential internalization of the negative beliefs and feelings associated with the stigmatised condition' (Bos et al. 2013) , understood as self-stigma, internalised stigma or shame. One can also distinguish between 'existential' and 'achieved' stigma (Falk 2001) . Existential stigma derives from a condition that is mostly outside of the control of the target of the stigma, while achieved stigma applies to those 'who have earned a stigma because of their conduct and/or because they contributed heavily to attaining that stigma' (11).",

It leads to social isolation, hampers access to care, and reduces treatment adherence (Mulea et al. 2009 ). During the Ebola pandemic in western Africa from 2014 to 2016, Ebola patients, survivors and orphans (and on occasion their relatives), as well as health workers involved in the response faced \"shunning and isolation, ill-treatment, [and] the rejection of treatment and political or economic exclusion\" (ERAP 2014, p. 1). Fear of stigma led Ebola-affected families to hide symptoms from their communities and health services (Hewlett and Hewlett 2008) . Similar reports emerged from survivors and health workers as a result of the SARS pandemic in some Asian countries (Lee et al. 2005; Verma et al. 2004 ). There is also published evidence of widespread stigma related to NTDs such as lymphatic filariasis, podoconiosis, Buruli ulcer, onchocerciasis, leprosy, and leishmaniasis (Hofstraat and Brakel 2016, p. 65) .",

A common critique of Goffman's theory, however, is that it provides an apolitical understanding of stigma, placing the onus of being 'discredited' on those that are stigmatised. Instead, as pointed out by scholars across the health and social sciences, stigma takes hold and is perpetuated within a social context with inherent power structures, serving to put in place and maintain hierarchies and social order (Link and Phelan 2001; Tyler and Slater 2018; Parker and Aggleton 2003) . Building on conceptualisation of stigma within the field of HIV (Earnshaw et al. 2013) , COVID-19-related stigma can be understood as a social phenomenon whereby people infected with or affected by COVID-19 are labelled, stereotyped or discriminated against and that intersects with existing fault lines of socioeconomic disadvantage, thereby perpetuating and reinforcing power structures and structural inequalities. Stigma is the visible 'tip of the iceberg' of much wider systems of beliefs about who carries disease and why that are grounded in and compounding social inequalities (Castro and Farmer 2005) .",

Drivers of stigma tend to be specific to the health condition, including fear of infection, lack of awareness, stereotypes and prejudice. Facilitators of stigma apply more broadly and include social and cultural norms, levels of inequality and legal and policy environments. The health-related stigma itself intersects with other stigma 'markers' such as age, gender, race and class. This then leads to experiences, manifestations and outcomes at individual, societal and institutional levels, ranging from internalisation of stigma to social exclusion and institutionalised discrimination (Stangl et al. 2019) .",

            "text": "First, lack of information, misinformation and misconceptions serve as key conduits for stigma, often assigning blame for disease. Whilst biomedical explanations may be widely available, alternative explanations or misinformation may emerge with specific individuals being singled out as causes or carriers of disease, playing into 'achieved' stigma. For example, during previous Ebola outbreaks in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), the disease had been attributed to witchcraft or sorcery, supposedly enacted by those who were perceived to 'benefit' from a patient's death, widows or mothers of the diseased, or people who are seen as outcast and in contact with non-natural forces (Ripoll et al. 2018) . In Pakistan, the general public incorrectly identified dementia symptoms as a normal part of aging, or perhaps more concerning, that it is attributable to the actions of the individual. The latter inevitably led to people believing that the person with dementia should be responsible for their own healthcare and outcomes (Boyce and Cataldo 2019). Similar dynamics have been observed in relation to disability with cultural and religious beliefs playing into false perceptions about causes of disability (Rohrwerder 2018) . Across Africa, stigma-inducing beliefs include disability being caused by ancestral curses or transgressions in previous generations, demonic possession and supernatural or otherworldly interference, promiscuity or other sinful behaviour by the mother or other family member or a punishment for wrongdoing by the person with a disability (ibid). Stigma may also arise from beliefs that people with a certain condition pose a burden to society. These experiences are clearly visible in relation to disability with low (and often misplaced) expectations about how people with disabilities can or cannot contribute to society leaving them labelled as less able or productive (Rohrwerder 2018). They also play out in relation to poverty, with people in poverty being blamed for their predicament on presumptions of laziness or unwillingness to work (O'Hara 2020).",

In Nigeria and Sudan politicians, have been seen wearing 'protective badges' that are marketed as 'virus blockers' or 'virus stoppers'.

Widespread anxiety about the cause and spread of SARS constituted an important mechanism for stigma to take hold at the time of the outbreak in Asia in the early 2000s (Person et al. 2004 ). In China, fear of contracting HIV was an important source of stigmatising attitudes associated with HIV and AIDS among rural-urban migrants (Hong et al. 2008 ). This also relates to 'existential' and 'achieved stigma'; disease-related stigma is often related to the extent to which the person being stigmatized is deemed at fault for having contracted the illness if their behaviour contributed to infection. Such 'victim-blaming' has been widely observed in relation to HIV and AIDS, including in the Caribbean (Castro and Farmer 2005) .",

In Ecuador, the family of the first person having contracted the virus fell victim to a harsh social media campaign, accusing them of irresponsible behaviour (Armario 2020) . In Indonesia, names of the first few cases were leaked online, with one woman being falsely blamed for having contracted the virus due to selling sex to a foreign client (ibid). In Kenya and Zimbabwe, survivors of COVID-19 were shunned by their communities after having returned from hospital for fear of them infecting others (Soi 2020; Bagcchi 2020) . In Bangladesh and India, social shunning of those (suspected of) being infected with COVID-19 reportedly led to suicide (Mamun and Griffiths 2020) . Healthcare workers around the world, including in LMICs, also face harassment and stigmatisation, largely out of fear for infection (Sotgiu and Dobler 2020; Taylor 2020) . In Mexico, doctors and nurses reportedly used bicycles to travel to and from work as they were denied access to public transport; in India, healthcare workers have been asked to vacate their rental homes and face social isolation (Bagcchi 2020) .",

Such policies are the most visible way of labelling those who are 'deviant' and distinguishing them from the rest of society who are deemed 'normal', laying the foundation for legitimisation and institutionalisation of stigma (Falk 2001) . The cholera response in Brazil, for example, unwittingly 'earmarked' specific communities or persons as foci of disease transmission through their targeting, treatment and risk communications strategy (Nations and Monte 1996) . In relation to disability, there is a long history of segregating people with disabilities from the rest of society by placing them in institutions, leading to perpetuation of negative stereotypes (Rohrwerder 2018) . With respect to old age, there are stereotypes that older adults are weak and need help (Coudin and Alexopoulos 2010), feeding into a notion that elderly persons represent a burden to society. Support to people in poverty is commonly targeted on premises of 'deservingness'(Van Oorschot 2002), leading to a toxic narrative about who should get what and why (or why not) (O'Hara 2020).",

Gender-based physical distancing measures may also bring to the light people's sexual orientation or non-conforming gender identities, putting them at risk of harassment and prejudice.

Cholera was also racialised, and poor black and indigenous people were 'othered' as dirty or filthy (Briggs and Mantini-Briggs 2003; Nations and Monte 1996) . Those living in informal settlements were unable to implement the government guidelines on cholera, because of inadequate infrastructure (e.g. water points and soap) (Ripoll 2017).

This in combination with the many difficulties that people in poverty and precarious conditions face in adhering to distancing measures provides a potent mix for stigma. Guidelines on hand hygiene, physical distancing or lockdown are often not plausible in densely populated, informal and impoverished contexts due to crowding, insufficient water and sanitation services and low and precarious incomes (Wilkinson 2020) . Similarly, farm workers, refugees and people living on the street are both less able to adhere to lockdown and physical distancing measures while also more affected by those measures (Devereux et al. 2020 ).

Few reports of Sinophobia in relation to COVID-19 have emerged from across LMICs, although experiences involving Chinese nationals in Uganda indicate that mistrust based on assumed nationality and origin is on the rise (Oryem 2020). Instead, a more disparate group of people 'on the move' have been stigmatised for spreading the virus. Depending on who and where these groups are, this may be associated with ethnicity, nationality or place of origin (United Nations 2020a). In Mozambique, for example, mine workers who migrated back home from South Africa were met with suspicion when integrating back into their communities (UN Department of Global Communications 2020). Finally, with a growing evidence base now indicating that Black, Asian and Hispanic patients are at a higher risk of contracting COVID-19 (Pan et al. 2020) , ethnic minority is further compounded as a co-stigma.",

Cultural differences and government responses to the pandemic are likely to drive how COVID-related stigma may (or not) form in relation to age.

The United Nations has also highlighted that surveillance and control of populations in order to contain the virus can galvanise oppression of sexual and gender minority peoples (United Nations 2020a), often in settings where transphobic and homophobic actions are already prevalent. In Uganda, for example, police reportedly used laws that prohibited more than 10 people gathering in public to arrest 23 people living in a sheltered housing project for LGBTI people (United Nations 2020b).

Moreover, they are predominantly premised on a biomedical approach and are therefore highly individualistic, aiming for empowerment on a top-down basis that is largely disconnected from the structures that facilitate and legitimise stigma in the first place (Scambler 2009 ). With COVID-19 still evolving and its longer-term responses beginning to take shape, a more proactive and strategic approach to avoid stigma taking hold at a large scale may be more equitable and effective. Adverse unintended social consequences are to be avoided (Hargreaves et al. 2020 ) rather than to be grappled with once they have taken hold. Crucially, any policy response needs to acknowledge and address the human rights violations that caused COVID-19 to flourish in the first place, and new violations that have resulted from the disease that allow stigma to reproduce itself and new stigmas to emerge. Without addressing the root causes of violations, the next disease or the next pandemic will repeat the stigma cycle where certain violations cause disease and new violations are created due to disease.",

The WHO has set out a rights-based approach to NTDs, and that could apply to COVID-19 and other transmissible diseases, which emphasises the principles of participation, non-discrimination, and accountability (WHO 2009 ). This resonates with a recently published report by the United Nations that places human rights at the centre of the response to COVID-19 and recommends, among others, that policies should guarantee meaningful participation of all sectors of society, that efforts need to reach those most vulnerable and traditionally marginalised, that political leaders and other actors should speak out against discrimination and that freedom of expression is guaranteed in order to hold governments to account (United Nations 2020a).

In the case of cholera in Brazil, for example, affected poor communities felt less stigmatised when the target of hygiene promotion activities and communication was universal (rather than specific to the poor communities), and when treatment was given as part of broader services for diarrheal disease or broader health system reinforcement, rather than stigmatising cholera treatment centres (Nations and Monte 1996) .

With many of the containment measures focused on physical distancing, the potential for groups to have contact and learn from each other is inevitably hampered. This poses a real conundrum in terms of trying to avoid stigma (Logie and Turan 2020) . In line with experiences with SARS, balancing the protection of public health while preventing stigmatisation of groups that are greater risk of contracting or spreading the disease during a rapidly evolving pandemic like COVID-19 is fraught with complexities (Person et al. 2004) . Experiences with Ebola in Liberia suggest that minimising social isolation, reintegration in recognition of the end of transmission risk and community-wide economic support serve as pre-emptive approaches for mitigating long-term stigma (Overholt et al. 2018) . Indeed, there is evidence that contact is far more effective than education in approaches to engage stigmatizers in efforts to reduce diseaserelated stigma. In addition, meaningful contact has been seen as a key pathway to reduce ageism (Christian et al. 2014) and stigma towards those with mental illness (Corrigan et al. 2012) . However, the potential viral spread of promoting contact between groups, particularly those that are the most vulnerable, calls for caution. Video contact may serve as an alternative, assuming that the infrastructure is in place, though this may be less effective than face-to-face contact (Corrigan et al. 2012 ). In addition, contact needs to be 'voluntary, equal, intensive and/ or rewarding, prolonged, or where a number of people are involved' (Pescosolido et al. 2008) . If the overall impact of social interactions is 'troubling, harmful, or otherwise disturbing,' then contact will most likely have a negative impact (ibid).",

Analogies between disease and war by referring to being 'invaded', to having to 'fight' the virus or having to win the 'battle' feed anxiety and fear of contagion (Logie and Turan 2020) that in turn play into stigma. Common use of the word \"vulnerable\" could reinforce existing stereotypes of weakness and helplessness, particularly in relation to old age (Nifosi-Sutton 2017) . Experiences with NTDs are also instructive in terms of how language can contribute to discriminatory discourse. With the term NTDs spanning almost forty diverse diseases, the words 'neglected' and 'tropical' provide little understanding of the diseases and their health impacts. Instead, they point to a socially constructed category that is reflective of environmental determinism and denial of systematic marginalisation that have allowed these diseases to persist (Shahvisi 2019) . Thus, the term and category 'Neglected Tropical Disease' is itself stigmatising, with those suffering from NTDs have been 'cast off' and often experiencing isolation, discrimination, and prejudice in their own communities. These lessons are instructive in terms of language used to categorise flu-like (such as COVID-19) diseases as Asian, and how it gives rise to accompanying discriminatory language that borders on hate-speech. While WHO introduced guidelines in 2015 to halt the naming of diseases in relation to their origin, this does not prevent the association of diseases with their place of origin from popular discourse with politicians and media being common culprits, as is the case for COVID-19 (Nature 2020).",

Policy surveillance can provide an analytical tool to assess prevalence and trends, and 'can facilitate the evaluation of health laws, health rights, and accountability mechanisms' (ibid). Rights-based approaches have diverse meanings and are subject to different interpretations, depending on the actors involved (Miller 2010) . It is therefore important to consider and make explicit the differing agendas that different actors might have. Doing so lays the foundation for the agreement that 'duty-bearers' meet their obligations and 'rights holders' claim their rights (WHO 2009) according to (1) the availability of facilities, good and services, (2) accessibility based on non-discrimination, physical, economic, and information accessibility, (3) acceptability in regards to medical ethics, culture, and sensitivities to age and gender, (4) quality of services and care both scientifically and medically (ibid).",

Disease elimination criteria often stipulate that programs 'count' disease burden and morbidity to claim success, while issues like stigma are less tangible and more difficult to address. However, given the early onset and persistence of stigma, seeking to prevent and minimise it during and after disease outbreaks is paramount (Overholt et al. 2018) . Doing so necessitates the inclusion of measures to assess and evaluate reductions in stigma. Although the measurement of stigma is complex, the scientific understanding of stigma depends on our capacity to observe and measure it (Link et al. 2004) . In a review of healthrelated stigma ( Van Brakel 2006) identified five common approaches to measurement, ranging from surveys of attitudes towards those with certain health conditions to interviews with those affected by such health conditions. These tools ought to be located in specific structural and cultural relations to facilitate the important distinction between the consequences of health-related stigma and a cross-cultural theory of health related-stigma (ibid). For example, stigma experiences and practices associated with HIV and NTDs might manifest similarly, yet they are products of entirely different structural drivers and facilitators (Scambler 2009 ). This exemplifies the need for a biosocial perspective of COVID-19-related stigma, locating it within wider structural and institutional systems as opposed to narrowing understandings to what happens at intra-and interpersonal levels (Logie and Turan 2020) .",

As noted above, affected groups can become agents of change with stigma serving as a catalyst. What we have learned from HIV activism over many years is that struggles are on-going; they require enduring attention, often beyond the mantras of inclusive policy actions or anti-stigma frameworks in the international community. Better conceiving stigma can provide a model of addressing such concerns, helping to promote meaningful health promotion action in terms informed by understandings of the relation between lived experience, structural vulnerabilities and (scientific) knowledge communities. Crises typically entail the coming together of experts in attempts to define and resolve a problem to hand-such as a virus and its associated social, political economic effects. What we advocate for here is a conscious broadening of expertise, to include sociological and other experiential knowledge about stigma as it informs life-worlds of inequality within which COVID-19 is intrinsically interconnected.",

These dynamics are further reinforced by efforts to contain the virus that hinge on separating and isolating vulnerable groups and infected individuals.

Accounting for and monitoring the interplay between factors at the interand intrapersonal, institutional and structural levels is vital for moving beyond a topdown and individualistic approach.
