More and more CHMs are becoming increasingly popular in the international markets. However, the quality control of CHMs is a significant issue for their acceptance and recognition in the international market. This review mainly focuses on the quality requirements for CHMs to enter the European Union (EU) market. Both Chinese and European regulations and quality controls are compared. Firstly, the EU medicinal regulatory system and relevant regulations were reviewed. Secondly, the key factors of the quality control of CHMs, including Chinese herbal drugs, extracts and products were compared with those of European herbal medicines in the EU market. Subsequently, three main registration routes for herbal medicinal products including Chinese herbal medicinal products entering the EU were introduced. Furthermore, the legal status of traditional Chinese medicine granules in the EU was also discussed. Through the comparison of the key quality factors for CHMs in China and the EU, the similarities and differences in terms of quality requirements and regulations are addressed, which provides a reference for the development of CHMs into the EU market.",

            "text": "Chinese herbal medicines (CHMs) are defined as Chinese herbal drugs, Chinese herbal drug extracts, Chinese herbal medicinal products and traditional Chinese medicine granules (TCM granules) in this review. The use of CHMs should be under the guidance of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) theories. TCM theories consider that CHMs have four properties, including heat, warm, cold and cool, and five flavors, including sweet, acrid, salty, sour and bitter [1] . For improving therapeutic effects and reducing toxicity, many Chinese herbal drugs need to be processed before clinical applications [2] . Thus, several traditional processing methods have been developed, including cutting, crushing, steaming, calcining, and stir-frying with or without liquid/solid excipients (honey, Chinese yellow wine, Chinese vinegar, salt, soil, rice wheat bran etc.) [2] [3] [4] . The classic dosage forms of traditional Chinese herbal medicinal products include decoction, pill, powder, concentrated decoction, ointment, plaster, syrup, wine, suppository, tincture and so on [5] . With the development of modern sciences and technologies, the dosage forms have been greatly enriched, encompassing tablets, capsules, granules, dripping pills, inhalants and so on [5, 6] . The personalized interventions and the holistic view are two important characteristics for treatments with CHMs, taking advantage of multi-targets and multi-components intervention strategies [7] . A significant amount of historical records, case studies and results of evidence-based clinical trials demonstrate CHMs play an important role in the treatment and prevention of diseases such as cardiovascular diseases [8] , liver damages [9] , cancers [10] , acute respiratory distress syndrome [11] and even recently COVID-19 [12, 13] . Therefore, the values of CHMs in the field of healthcare are widely recognized [14] and more and more people worldwide have used them in daily life for various health-related issues [15] .",

Descriptions of preparations are called monographs. It is a crucial reference work for all organizations and individuals in the field of pharmaceutical research and development, manufacture and testing around the world [17] . The mainly representative national pharmacopoeias include the Chinese Pharmacopoeia (ChP), the Ph. Eur., the Japanese Pharmacopoeia (JP), and the United States Pharmacopeia (USP)-National Formula (NF). In addition, there are some regional and/ or commercial standards with herbal monographs, e.g., the Hong Kong Chinese Material Medica Standards, the American Herbal Pharmacopoeia, the traditional Chinese Medicine standards of the International Organization of Standardization, and herbal monographs of the World Health Organization [17] [18] [19] . In different pharmacopoeias, there is a huge variation in the numbers of recorded Chinese materia medica. For example, the 2020 edition of the ChP records 2711 monographs of Chinese materia medica including herbal drug, animal-sourced materia medica and mineral-sourced materia medica [20] ; however, there are relatively fewer herbal drug and/ or herbal extract monographs in the Ph. Eur., the JP and the USP-NF. No animal-sourced materia medica and mineral-sourced materia medica are elaborated in the Ph. Eur. In addition, since the quality control systems of herbal drugs are different in each country or region, monographs of CHMs could be different in different pharmacopoeias.",

Eur., while it is normally described in words in the ChP, e.g., by comparison with spots of the reference herbal drug and/or the chemical reference substances in the TLC chromatogram, same color or fluorescent spots of the test solution are displayed on the corresponding positions of the chromatogram. In addition, the other main differences between them involve some specific technical requirements such as pesticide residues, heavy metals, and aflatoxins. For pesticide residue, there are total of 69 pesticide residue limits recorded in the Ph. Eur. (Additional file 1: Table S1 ), which involve the limits of organochlorine pesticides, organophosphorus pesticides, pyrethroid pesticides, etc., while 33 pesticide residue limits are recorded in the ChP (Additional file 1: Table S2 ). For heavy metals, the general limits for herbal drugs in the Ph. Eur. are as follows: cadmium (\u2264 1.0 ppm), lead (\u2264 5.0 ppm), and mercury (\u2264 0.1 ppm), but special requirements may be needed for some herbal drugs such as Lini Semen (cadmium \u2264 0.5 ppm), and there are no requirements for arsenic and copper. In the ChP, there is a guiding standard for heavy metals, which are cadmium (\u2264 1 ppm), lead (\u2264 5 ppm), mercury (\u2264 0.2 ppm), arsenic (\u2264 2 ppm) and copper (\u2264 20 ppm), respectively, and 20 Chinese herbal drugs are required for heavy metal test compulsorily (Additional file 1: Table S3 ). For aflatoxins, in the Ph. Eur., all herbal drugs are required the detection of aflatoxins. In the ChP, the limitation of aflatoxins is gradually being improved. The 2005 edition of the the ChP Supplement contains the \"Aflatoxin Assay\" in appendix for the first time. Subsequently, the 2010 edition of the ChP increased aflatoxin screening targets and limitation standards for 4 Chinese herbal drugs, including Ziziphi spinosae semen, Persicae semen, Sterculiae lychnophorae semen and Citri reticulatae pericarpium [25] . The number of Chinese herbal drugs which are required to test aflatoxins increased to 14 in 2015 edition of the ChP. While in 2020 edition of the ChP, there are 16 Chinese herbal drugs to be required the limitation of aflatoxins, and the limits are aflatoxin B 1 (\u2264 5 \u03bcg/kg) and sum of aflatoxin G 2 , aflatoxin G 1 , aflatoxin B 2 , aflatoxin B 1 (\u2264 10 \u03bcg/kg) (Additional file 1: Table S4 ). In addition to aflatoxins, in the 2020 edition of the ChP, Coicis semen is also required to test its zearalenone (\u2264 500 \u03bcg/kg) [23] .",

However, there is also a significant difference between them, which often causes re-development (also named the second development of manufacturing process) for Chinese herbal medicinal products when applying for registration of herbal medicinal products or food supplements in the EU. For production of an herbal medicinal product, there are normally two stages, one is for the manufacture of extracts, namely intermediate, and the other is for finished products, such as table, capsule and liquids. In the EMA, the two stages are relatively independent, and herbal extracts are required to be defined with full specifications and stability tests (Fig. 2) . And the compositions, namely the amounts of herbal extracts and various excipients are fixed for each finished product. But in the ChP, different situations could be found that the two stages are normally in one continuous workflow, which integrates the two stages into one entire manufacturing process from herbal substances to finished products. In this case, when preparing a technical dossier for manufacturing for the EU, the \"herbal extracts\" are artificially defined with specifications and stability tests. This can cause a problem, namely the composition of the individual finished medicinal product is not fixed. It is well reported that environmental growth conditions can significantly influence the composition of herbal materials [28] [29] [30] [31] . Due to this nature of herbal drugs variation, in the Chinese pharmaceutical industrial extraction processes there is a frequent variation in extraction rate, thus the addition of excipients is used for the compensation of this variation (Fig. 2 ). This is a big hurdle for application for registration of Chinese herbal medicinal products in the EU when the original Chinese pharmaceutical manufacture procedure is directly used in technique dossier. This is because according to the basic requirement for registration of a medicinal product in the EU, the composition of an herbal medicinal product should be relatively unchanged or with very narrow variations from batch to batch and during the storage.",

For those where the constituents of their therapeutic activity are unknown, the variation should not surpass \u00b1 10% of the declared assay value at release and at the end of shelf-life. However, broader limits could be acceptable if justified, which is a case-by-case decision. For the majority of multi-herbal combinations of Chinese herbal medicinal products, simultaneous extraction of several herbal substances with the same extraction solvent such as water or ethanol/water mixture is a normal manufacturing procedure. For quality control, these mixed extracts should fulfil the same requirements as single herbal extracts and each of the individual extracts within the mixture should be qualitatively and quantitatively analyzed in principle.",

In 2021, the monograph of contaminant PAs (2.8.26) comes into force in the Ph. Eur., in which the analytical method is introduced (liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry). Now, the herbal medicinal products in the EU need to be tested for PAs, and 28 of them are required to be detected and quantified (Additional file 1: Table S5 ).

Generally speaking, the high product quality management system in Germany is respected. In 2016, the German Federal Administrative Court made a decision on the legal status of TCM granules that TCM granules are judged to be \"Pr\u00e4sentationsarzneimittel\". Pr\u00e4sentationsarzneimittel (German) is translated as \"presentation medicinal products\" in English, which means that TCM granules are medicinal products that cannot be directly used by consumers but require a doctor or professional practitioner's prescriptions. Therefore, their medicinal use is based on their designation or presentation. For quality control, quality monographs of TCM granules are in the process of establishment by the Deutscher Arzneimittel-Codex (DAC)/German Drug Codex.

In particular, the pharmacopoeias of some countries have established basic requirements for the quality control of CHMs, which have become the threshold for the market access of CHMs in these countries. Comparing the quality standards of CHMs in different pharmacopoeias, it is obvious that they are different in terms of the species and quantities of CHMs as well as the items stipulated in monographs. Moreover, the numbers and requirements of CHMs recorded in pharmacopoeias of other countries are significantly different from those in the ChP. This status quo has greatly restricted the acceptance of TCM at international level. Compared with western medicine, CHM has its unique features. It needs to be used compatibly under the guidance of the theoretical system of TCM. This should take into consideration the quality control of CHM preparations. However, due to the lack of evidence for effective substance in many CHMs and the limitations of existing technologies, there is still no set of matching standards available. In existing quality standards of CHMs, quality marker usually is just one or two components or a class of substances, such as volatile oil, which is often impossible to accurately assess the quality of CHMs. Therefore, how to conduct systematic research on the quality markers of CHMs and achieve technological breakthroughs, so as to establish a set of leading quality control technologies and international standards, will become a research hotspot and challenge in the field of quality control of CHMs. Realization of this goal will greatly promote the internationalization of TCM and benefit human health. It is worth stating that systems biology and network pharmacology, which focuses on complex interactions in biological systems and studies drug actions and interactions with multiple targets, have the potential to be useful and important tools for systematic research of effective substances of CHMs [37, 38] . Above all, evidence based clinical investigation is currently considered to be a golden standard for scientific acceptance of CHMs [39] . From this perspective, how to bridge western medical science with TCM theory and philosophy is still considered to be a challenge. Chinese medicine's prevention and treatment strategy is multi-target and non-linear approach. Research on the combination of different disciplines with systems pharmacology may shed some light for future medicinal sciences.",

As a matter of fact, there have always been some obstacles to CHMs entering the European market. This is largely due to the unclear understandings of quality control of CHMs in the EU by Chinese pharmaceutical companies. Therefore, in this review, the differences have been elaborated in detail by comparing the quality standards of CHMs in the EU and China. Chinese enterprises should focus on and have a good grasp of these differences to save costs and to enable a smoother operation/transition when introducing their Chinese herbal medicinal products into the EU market. In addition, TCM granules, as a special case, are elaborated separately in this review. In the EU, TCM granules are regarded as food supplements, except in Germany, where TCM granules are managed and monitored as medicinal products, which needs to get the attention of related Chinese enterprises.
