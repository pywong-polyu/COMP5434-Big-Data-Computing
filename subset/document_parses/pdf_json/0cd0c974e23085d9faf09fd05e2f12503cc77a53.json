In developing countries, the nursing staff is considered as low-profile staff (lower cadre/grade), and they have to perform many tasks at once [2] . The nature of their duties in hospitals is very complex, and nurses are bound to perform several tasks in parallel. Such busy occupational requirements push them towards creativity, so they can discover the newest ways to perform these tasks simultaneously; hence, polychronicity is required. Polychronicity represents each one's preference for dealing with many tasks simultaneously [3] [4] [5] .",

However, limited studies are available regarding creativity in the area of the service sector and more specifically in healthcare [7] . The healthcare sector has been recognized as an important and life-saving actor during the COVID-19 pandemic [8] . Therefore, the advancement of the healthcare sector becomes crucial in order to cope with the changing environment all over the world. Creativity at an individual level becomes a critical mechanism for the development of employees working in the healthcare sector in the era of advanced technologies [7] . In this regard, nurses' creativity has gained more attention of researchers in the field of healthcare [9] . In addition toother factors, the most influential factor that shapes nurses' creativity is their own abilities and attitudes. Among these factors, the most important one is their polychromic attitude and level of engagement at work. However, theliterature lacks insights into employee creativity through polychronicity, job engagement, and functional flexibility. Therefore, an explicit study is required to realize the role of nurses'polychronicity on their job engagement and creativity in the workplace.Creativity represents the development of new and helpful ideas that increase the efficiency and effectiveness of different processes [10] .",

However, the direct link between polychronicity and employee creativity has not been explored so far, specifically in developing nations such asPakistan. To overcome this research gap, this paper tries to enhance the existing knowledge by analyzing the direct impact of polychronicity on creativity. The current paper also analyzes job engagement (JE) as a mediator between the polychronicity and creativity link. JE refers to an optimistic, satisfying work-related mental condition featured by liveliness, devotion, and commitment [12] , although numerous researchers have linked JE with job performance [13] , job requirements, job means [12] and job satisfaction [13] . There is no single study showing the effect of polychronicity on creativity using JE as a mediator. To fill this gap in the existing knowledge on this specific topic, the current research was initiated.",

            "text": "The notion of creativity remains a central part of focus agenda for all organizations [14] . Additionally, this shift of focus is more profound in the healthcare sector for a number of reasons [9] . Among these reasons for the emergent demand for workforce creativity in the healthcare sector are COVID-19 related issues. The COVID-19 pandemic has changed patterns of work for doctors and nurses [8] . Each day, working staff in the healthcare sector face new technologies, new equipment, and new techniques. To face these challenges, this work force must be equipped with creative ideas; therefore, the employee's creativity is the demand of current decade, specifically for the healthcare sector [7] . The current study shows how employee creativity is initiated through polychronicity and job engagement. Polychronicity enable nurses to think of the newest methods and techniques. The polychronic behavior of nurses itself is a major antecedent of employee creativity [10] . In addition to this direct impact, the current study shows that creativity is related to one own's commitment and effort, so polychronicity alone is not enough to prolong employee creativity in the healthcare sector, and there is the missing link of employee job engagement [15, 16] . Therefore, this study investigates the mediating role of job engagement between polychronicity and employee creativity. This study also shows that employee functional flexibility speeds up the link between polychronicity and employee creativity. The concept of polychronicity was firstly used to explain the preference of people to do numerous tasks simultaneously (i.e., more than one task at the same time); furthermore, employees with polychronicity believe they are good at performing several tasks at once rather than doing one task [17] . Polychronic individuals display the preference to perform many tasks simultaneously and change their focus among different tasks, instead of focusing on a single issue [18, 19] . Polychronic employees perform a combination of various activities at a given time and perform work in the best way by handling related disruptions [1] . Polychronicity does not include employee behaviors to manage simultaneous tasks, but it includes employee preferences to perform multiple tasks at once [20] . Therefore, this study argues that the employee preference for engaging in multiple tasks enhances employee creativity.",

The efforts exerted by employees to find new ways to accomplish multiple things at one time help employees to be more creative than conventional procedures [32] . The previous researcher in [34] stated that employee polychronicity helps to start the process of creativity and innovation. Therefore, the creativity of employees mainly depends on the importance givento employees who wish to perform multiple tasks at once. Such importance given to performing several things at once is charged by polychronicity. Employee polychronicity is vital for promoting creative thinking and changing work behaviors from conventional ways [14] . Paramedic staff needs to be more polychronic, as effective time usage has been considered as an important area for better behaviors in the workplace. Time use has received much attention from researchers in polychronicity [32] . Nurses in hospitals need to be involved in multiple issues at once. Polychronicity in nurses explains how they switch and prefer to complete different issues in a specified period of time [20] . If nurses are not able to deal with many tasks simultaneously, they need to be more creative to perform several things at once [18] . Therefore, a polychronic attitude triggers employee creativity. Workload variations and job nature are very sensitive and routine matters for nurses; therefore, a polychronic attitude is important for maximum job performance. Multitasking might affect service delivery; to ensure good medical care, the adoption of creativity is important to deal with many tasks simultaneously [35] . Responsibilities for nurses, such as patient care, include medication, dressing, beddings, and record-keeping that requirethem to be more creative for better service quality. Hence, this suggests that polychronicity is a significant factorthat influences creativity.",

            "text": "The notion of job engagement was first devised by the previous researcher [36] , who explained job engagement as an individual's concentration and ability to work and put in effort within the group. Job engagement is a condition where an employee is involved in his work such that it satisfies all three levels of consciousness, that is, affective or emotional, physical, and cognitive levels [36] . Emotions cover the affective part, where the employee is satisfied with the task assigned and happily working on it. Physical consciousness includes intrinsic motivation, individuality, and control; moreover, cognition includes the involvement of employees in work. Subsequently, job engagement directs employees to put effort into their targeted goals [37] . Research findings such as [38] show that job engagement is a fine job-related mindset that consists of absorption, dedication, and strength. Strength describes the energy and spark required during work, also defined as readiness to put effort into accomplishing the assigned task. Dedication means one's level of passion, enthusiasm, pride, and inspiration. The third level, absorption, refers to the obsession, concentration, and absorption of the work. This study posits that job engagement makes a connection between polychronicity and employee creativity. Similarly, committed nurses have more propensity to present proactive behavior and active personal ideas with high motivation, which can generate a new set of procedures for doing the entire job through an increased creativity. Seemingly few research studies determined the role of job engagement for good job performance [13] , job requirements and means [12] , and job satisfaction [14] . However, job engagement as a bridge between polychronicity and employee creativity has not yet been investigated; more specifically, this area is under researched in the context of nursing staff. Hence, this study argued that polychronic employees have a number of reasons to work in the existing position that enables them to work on multiple tasks at the same time. This psychological empowerment helps nurses to become attached to their jobs and try to find new ways to perform their tasks [39] . However, polychronicity creates job engagement that gives benefits to employees, and they feel more attractive and able to attain freedom. This perception of a secure future and freedom allow employees to be more creative. Job engagement helps employees to improve their ability concerning the creation of new concepts, new solutions, and unique work attitudes.",

Lastly, handling multiple issues generally requires a significant sacrifice of time and effort. Sacrificing their spare time and energy helps employees to motivate themselves, become involved in their work, and try to find some creative ideas to perform their tasks.

Furthermore, polychronicity in employees offers a comprehensive mechanism that can strengthen their creativity through job commitment. The current paper theorizes that job commitment mediates the link between polychronicity and IWB. We argue that job engagement should act as a mediating relationship between nurses' polychronicity and creativity, as the polychronicity of nurses can enhance the creativity of employees when they are engaged in their work. Nurses are more creative in their routine tasks when they are devotionally engaged in their work [40, 41] . According to a previous study [42] , job engagement is the result of polychronicity. In developing countries, nurses leave their job as they have to face many difficulties and to perform hectic job activities [43] . Job engagement increases the likelihood that they will not leave their job and will try to find creative and useful ideas to perform multiple things at the same time [44] . Therefore, we argue that job engagement links polychronic nurses with creativity. Job engagement ensures that nurses engage in their job with full attention to perform numerous tasks at once to be more creative [41] . As [45] stated, nursing is a noble profession that directly serves humans. It is further argued that without job engagement, it is not possible for every nurse to perform multiple tasks with creativity at once, as job engagement mediates the link between polychronicity and creativity. Job engagement acting as mediator between the polychronicity and creativity of nurses increases the likelihood that they will perform multiple tasks. Job engagement reduces the turnover intention in nurses, which results in job engagement linking polychronicity with creativity [41, 42] .Therefore, the above debate determines the next hypothesis.",

Functional flexibility asa process of changing working roles accordingly helps the polychronic nurses to act in a creative way [19] . Hence, the functional flexibility of nurses is important for improving the impact of polychronicity on creativity [47] . Functional flexibility is an important process to achieve diverse tasks, and when employees are polychronic, i.e., prefer to perform several tasks, the creativity level of employee will be higher [48] . Functional flexibility is employee's capabilities, such as diversity of skills, and an extra-role behavior, which is important to boost the effect of polychronicity on creativity.",

The findings demonstrated that nurses' polychronicity can improve their creativitythrough the support of functional flexibility. The organizational structures play a significant role in reaching the proposed targets. Thus, it is undeniable that for accomplishing different tasks simultaneously, the polychronic worker should search for new creative ways; however, for this, they must have the ability to adapt to new tasks. Therefore, when these subordinated workers are directly taking part in the decision-adopting process for resolving the problems they face, they will be very efficient. Thus, the effect of polychronicity on employee creativity will be quicker and more effective when employees are flexible. The findings of testing the last hypothesis of our study are validated by the previous research in [57] that highlighted that employee creativity required improved adaptive skills, i.e., functional flexibility provides help for the employees to engage in committed efforts to give their valuable energy in new idea generation and application, which supports employee creativity. Functional flexibility asa process of changing working roles accordingly helps polychronic nurses to act in creative way [17] . The functional flexibility of nurses is important for improving the impact of polychronicity on creativity and for achieving diverse tasks [38, 47, 48] , which also proves the same boosted impact of polychronicity on creativity through functional flexibility.",

In this context, the current research built on the findings of other existing studies that investigated many other antecedents of employee creativity besides polychronicity [24] . Thus, it identified that employee creativity is a significant result of polychronicity. The existing studies connected polychronicity with organizational performance, work performance [13] , sales increase [24] , job requirements, job means [12] , job fulfillment [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] , and purpose orientation [16] . All these previous findings supported the motivation to currently analyze the polychronicity and employee creativity link. One main finding of this research was that polychronicity can be related to employee creativity. Another important result of this study is that, besides analyzing the direct link between polychronicity and employee, we have investigated the significant role played by JE in this relation.",

            "text": "In an attempt to unveil the impact of employee polychronicity on employee creativity, previous studies have demonstrated that polychronicity effects improve overall organizational performance. For the healthcare industry, the current study investigates a direct relation between polychronicity and employee creativity while also investigating an indirect relation via job engagement. In addition, the current study also employs functional flexibility as a moderator for the relationship between polychronicity and creativity. Overall, the study found that nurses with a polychronic attitude were more creative when completing multiple tasks at the same time, indicating that a polychronic attitude stimulates employee creativity [15, 17] . It is concluded that job engagement mediates the polychronicity and creativity link. When nurses are engaged in many tasks, they will be more creative if they are attached to their jobs. Hence, JE is a precondition to establish nurses' creativity. Finally, the data showed that nurses' polychronicity can boost their creativity by allowing them to be more functionally flexible. As it is evident that the polychronic worker must find new innovative ways to do several jobs at the same time, they must take advantage of their functional flexibility level and have the ability to adapt to new activities. This research also found that when functional flexibility grows, the impact of polychronicity on employees' creativity grows even more. The current study, in theory, illuminated the interesting results of polychronic nurses in terms of creativity, and it adds to the existing research on antecedents of employee creativity other than polychronicity. Furthermore, in light of JE as a mediating variable, a significant contribution to the existing hypothesis was made, extending the previous research work [2] . This study establishes a broad and robust model for presenting polychronicity outcomes by enhancing the purpose of nurses' polychronicity and broadening the scope of polychronicity in existing literature. Alternatively, this study adds to the current body of research by demonstrating that functional flexibility is an important moderator in enhancing the favorable impact of polychronicity on employee creativity. In practice, nurses must complete multiple tasks at the same time as part of their regular routine. As a result, people must employ ingenuity in order to complete multiple activities at the same time. Supervisors must also pay more attention to subordinates who are working on multiple projects at once in order to provide them with an appropriate working environment in which to increase their creativity. They should place a greater emphasis on the nurses' polychronicity abilities to help them increase their creativity. As a result, supervisors should encourage and motivate their subordinates to become more involved and devoted to their employment. These objectives can be met through increasing their interpersonal relationships, teamwork, fair and enticing compensation packages, bonuses, forming emotional and mental links with their professions, and enhancing their creativity. Finally, supervisors should fully embrace decentralized frames and encourage their subordinates to provide meaningful and helpful input. Once all of these links and efforts are established, the favorable impact of nurses' polychronicity on their job creativity will expand. Considering the limitation of providing a causal explanation, the current study concludes that the relation between polychronicity and employee creativity can be described as a progressiveprocess.As a result, we can conclude that a long-term research design might yield more intriguing data for this causal relationship.
