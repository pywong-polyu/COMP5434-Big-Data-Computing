            "text": "The Covid-19 emergency is demonstrating the need to follow new solutions that can support the important role played by non-profit organizations around the world. Contrary to what should have happened to further combat the effect of pandemic, the majority of philanthropic organisations had a negative impact on fundraising, suffering a substantial decrease. Today, the Blockchain can play a pivotal role to re-establish prepandemic standards and enhance the development of global philanthropy. However, it is still too little considered due to the criticalities encountered during the launch and development of the initiatives as well as for a general incomprehension of its technology. Therefore, this work aims to demonstrate the Blockchain impact on the development of charity 4.0, especially in an extremely dramatic historical moment marked by the Covid-19 pandemic. The objective is achieved through the case study of Charity Wall, an emerging Italian social marketplace appreciated by important business associations for its innovative solutions in the charity 4.0 sector and for the important support provided to NPOs during their traditional function as well as against Covid-19 in Italy. Through a benchmark analysis, this work succeeds in highlighting the innovative solutions proposed by Charity Wall compared to the charity 4.0 systems on the market. More specifically, through the Charity Wall case study it is possible to demonstrate which aspects of Blockchain technology can be used to strengthen the philanthropic system by avoiding cases of fraud to the detriment of beneficiaries, receivers and donors as well as to create a closer network between the various philanthropic players to support charitable initiatives against the Covid-19.",

Authors such as James (2018); Mainardes et al. (2016) ; Bekkers and Wiepking (2011) provided important studies on donations flows by analyzing qualitative and quantitative as well as social aspects. Some authors instead pleaded an approach related to psychological principles, often due to the evidence of donations already made (Jacob et al. 2018) or the empathy of donors and the emotions aroused (Dickert et al. 2016) . Furthermore, in such a context, the analysis of the motivations for giving has also come to lower and more practical principles; Wong and Ortmann (2016) ; Bekkers (2010) ; Karlan and List (2007) ; Vesterlund (2006) clarified some aspects related to material incentives and how price could influence the purpose of giving.",

Transactions in crypto currency, in fact, are immediate and without borders (Huberman et al. 2019) . They are accepted even in countries where the banking system is less developed and eliminate the need for intermediaries.

The rapid spread across the many areas is most likely due to the fact that organizations have discovered that the Blockchain is a reliable and accurate technological solution to address their daily challenges (Fischer 2018; Elsden et al. 2018; Gervais et al. 2016) . According to several studies (Durnev et al. 2018; Manski 2017) , the Blockchain has provided significant added value for achieving the social impact objectives of organizations. As evidenced by a study promoted by the Stanford University and the Center for Social Innovation (Galen et al. 2018) , 66% believe that the Blockchain is an improvement over other methods, while 20% believe that it is necessary to solve their problems; only 14% think that it is a way to solve the problem, but that the other non-Blockchain solutions can be better.",

The literature study and the clear evidences suggest that government regulations are not adapting quickly enough to properly incentivize (Smorgunov 2018) or facilitate growth (Deshpande et al. 2017a, b) Dong et al. 2014) . A \"hostile\" regulatory environment or unclear regulations push organizations to operate in a \"grey area\", or even in a lack of rules (Kim and Justl 2018) . Some have also reported that in their view regulators do not fully understand the technology and its potential impact (Deshpande et al. 2017a, b) . Therefore, it is worth repeating, important policy measures are urgently needed to resolve this regulatory gap (Dierksmeier and Seele 2018) not only for the sake of a greater social impact (Johnson and Post 1996) but also to allow organizations working with Blockchain technology in compliance with a well-defined regulation (Werbach 2018) .

Today a \"right to donation\" should be guaranteed, as donation is a way to build the common good and to develop a community based on principles of reciprocity and unity. However, this right is not always respected. And it implies a progressive lack of confidence in the third sector with an increase in requests for transparency from donors and public administration and a consequent reduction in donations and public tenders. Let's take a practical example. A substantial number of people have felt the desire to donate for the recent corona virus pandemic. Surely, they have wondered how their donations were used, whether for the stated purposes or for others. Thus, the purpose of the introduction of the Blockchain in the charity sector is to always be able to answer these questions and to avoid hearing from the media that money has not reached its destination, but has been used for something else.",

In this sense, as highlighted by the British Government in 2018 with the study of countless cases, the fraud at the expense of donors, beneficiaries and receivers can be numerous: a. the fraudster may be responsible for the payment of charity invoices without being an authorised signatory to the beneficiary institution's bank account. Being able to access the credentials of the senior management team's bank account to set up false beneficiaries, the fraudster can then transfer the funds to his bank account. The invoices are falsified and the fraudster uses the bank's access data to authorise the false invoices (Gov.UK 2018); b. the organization's management fraudster may improperly manage the distribution of donated amounts by manipulating the relevant accounting records (Gov.UK 2018) ; c. the operator supervising the charitable actions may divert sums fraudulently by means of deliberate overpayments for goods and documents which the beneficiary groups have not received.

Charity Wall add a layer of transparency to the total flow of donations. It can reduce the costs of charity by removing intermediaries, the papers of the stakeholder's internal processes and improving digitalization and accountability. Furthermore, CW can reduce the costs by developing higher efficiency and faster procedures as well as enhanced donor base like crypto-donors. Although still a start-up, Charity Wall's reality is therefore very young, it demonstrates a hacking growth (Ellis and Brown 2017; Ellis 2010 ) and the contribution it can make to the social sphere through the processes of donations has already attracted countless leading players. Assolombarda, for example, is the most important association of the entire Italian industrial system, called Confindustria.

Doctors and health personnel heroically work in conditions of urgency, extreme stress and the lack of protection systems subject them to the risk of infection. To supply the material to hospitals, it is necessary to purchase it and, therefore, to have funds available. Charity Wall wants to concretely help to fight the emergency and launches the first fundraising campaign based on the Blockchain technology. Charity Wall uses the Blockchain by tracking and certifying the entire flow of the donation, from its payment to its use. Furthermore, it allows donors to donate in total safety and to constantly monitor, comment and verify the development of each specific social project, through its storytelling, its documentation and related news updated by the proposing body and the actors involved. Charity Wall uses Ethereum's permission less Blockchain, estimated to date at around 8000 \"blocks\", as it is public, therefore not censurable and controllable by a single person, and for its characteristics of transparency and security. Through the Blockchain, Charity Wall allows the donor to verify all the steps of his donation as well as the use of the funds raised and any documentation, with the certainty that the information entered has never been altered by anyone. Furthermore, following the certification of a digital document, issues a certificate of authenticity with all the details to trace it, the association that issued it, the project to which it belongs and the detail of its registration on Blockchain. Charity Wall reduces the costs of charity by reducing the intermediaries, the documents of the internal processes of the interested parties, improving their digitization and accountability, allowing them to develop greater efficiency and faster procedures. In fact, the donation will be used to purchase material that will be donated directly to the hospital, reducing the costs and times of intermediaries or other associations.",

This situation is mainly due to two reasons: the problems that the traditional charity system too often entails and the critical consequences of Covid-19. Nevertheless, the charity sector has untapped potential. It can be achieved by adopting Blockchain technology and stimulating the development of initiatives such as Charity Wall that can turn the donation system into a completely renewed process. As shown in the present work, this objective can regain trust in philanthropy by avoiding potential cases of fraud and misappropriation of charitable funds as well as economic, financial and social repercussions. The use of the Blockchain technology in the charity sector represents another dimension, an improvement that has nothing to do with what has been done so far. Money has always been collected and used in humanitarian funds, but today this process can be done better, more efficiently and in a totally transparent way. The Charity Wall case shows, in fact, that the technological potential for charity can be increased by offering new services, greater security and greater social impact, especially at a dramatic time marked by the Covid-19 pandemic. With initiatives like Charity Wall, the positive results for NPOs can be numerous: regaining the relationship with small and medium-sized donors, reducing operating costs, perfecting the entire supply chain and speeding up donation processes in favor of the final beneficiaries. Thus, there is an urgent need for a better awareness of the potential that Blockchain can bring from both the private and the public sectors. Only by gaining full awareness, this technology will be used exploiting its full potential, by stimulating new applications in the various fields of non-profit sector.",
