Several reports have shown diminished immunogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in both kidney transplant recipients (KTR) and dialysis patients (DP), as evidenced in a recent meta-analysis [1]. Furthermore, two recent articles have included comparisons between the immunogenicity of the mRNA-1273 (Moderna) versus the BNT162b2 (Pfizer) vaccine in these populations [2, 3]. Boyarsky et al. studied a cohort of solid organ transplant recipients, including KTR, and reported lower seroconversion rates after receiving the Pfizer vaccine [3]. Stumpf et al. also described lower seroconversion rates in KTR and DP receiving the Pfizer vaccine [2]. However, none of these articles reported the titers of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Therefore, we here compared the immunogenicity of the two available mRNA vaccines BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) versus mRNA-1273 (Moderna) in both KTR and DP regarding both seroconversion rates and, among responding patients, antibody titers.",

Immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies against the receptorbinding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein were measured using an in-house Luminex assay [5] . In order to investigate only patients without prior SARS-CoV-2 infection, we excluded 1) patients with a PCR-proven history of SARS-CoV-2 infection (n = 37) and 2) patients who tested positive for anti-RBD IgG antibodies (> 1) at the day of vaccination without a PCR-proven history of SARS-CoV-2 infection (n = 16), as a surrogate of previous SARS-CoV-2 infection. Response to first vaccination was defined as anti-RBD IgG positivity (signal-tonoise ratio > 1) at day 21.

First, seroconversion rates in adults with hematologic malignant disease, whom in majority received B-cell-depleting monoclonal Abs, were higher in patients vaccinated with mRNA-1273 (Moderna) compared to BNT162b2 (Pfizer) (50% vs. 33%, p=0.013) [6] . Second, a study of individuals in the multi-state Mayo Clinic Health System revealed that the mRNA-1273 vaccine was associated with a lower incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection (p=0.0034) as well as with a significant two-fold risk reduction against breakthrough infection compared to BNT162b2 [7] . Whether observed differences between these two mRNA-vaccines relate to a different mRNA sequence, a difference in dosage (100 \u00b5g mRNA in Moderna vs. 30 \u00b5g mRNA in Pfizer) or a difference in vaccine composition, remains to be investigated. Furthermore, future studies are needed to assess whether our observed differences remain identical 21 days after a second dose of mRNA vaccine; and whether they are associated with a better clinical protection. Meanwhile, mRNA-1273 (Moderna) might be the preferred vaccine in kidney transplant and dialysis patients. is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in (which was not certified by peer review) preprint is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in (which was not certified by peer review) preprint",
