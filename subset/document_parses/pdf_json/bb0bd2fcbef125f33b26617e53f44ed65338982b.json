The required information for diagnosis is obtained from a patient's medical history, and various medical tests that capture the patient's functional and anatomical structures through diagnostic imaging methods such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (f MRI), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT), and other diagnostic tools including the electroenchephalogram (EEG). However, given the often time-consuming diagnosis process which is prone to subjective interpretation and inter-observer variability, clinical experts have begun to benefit from computer-assisted interventions. Automation is of benefit in situations where there is limited access to healthcare services and physicians. Automation is also being pursued to increase the quality and decrease the cost of healthcare systems [1] .",

The success of deep learning in many fields is due in part to the availability of rapidly increasing computing resources and large experimental datasets, and in part to the ability of deep learning to extract representations from data structured as regular grids (i.e., images) through stacked convolutional operations. There are several review papers available that analyse the benefits of traditional machine learning and deep learning methods for the detection and segmentation of medical anomalies and anatomical structures, and computer-aided diagnosis [2, 3] . Although CNNs have shown impressive performance in the medical field for imaging (MRI, CT) and non-imaging applications (f MRI, EEG), their conventional formulation is limited to data structured in an ordered, grid-like fashion. Several physical human processes generate data that are naturally embedded in a graph structure as illustrated in Figure 1 (Top). Traditional CNNs analyse local areas based on fixed connectivity (determined by the convolutional kernel), leading to limited performance, difficulty in interpreting the functional and anatomical structures being modeled, and an inability to capture complex neighbourhood information. Therefore, machine-learning models that can exploit graph structures are at an advantage as they enable an effective representation of complex physical entities and processes, and irregular relationships.",

Much of the information coming from disciplines such as chemistry, biology, genetics, and healthcare is not well suited to vector-based representations, and instead requires complex data structures. Graphs inherently capture relationships between entities, and are thus potentially very useful for these applications to encode relational information between variables [4] . Hence, effort has been devoted to the generalization of graph neural networks (GNN) into non-structural (unordered) and structural (ordered) scenarios. However, while the use of graph-based representations is becoming more common in the medical domain, such approaches are still scarce compared to conventional deep learning methods, and their potential to address many challenging medical problems is yet to be fully realised.

            "text": "The adaptation of deep learning from images to graphs has resulted in a new crossdomain field of graph-based deep learning that seeks to learn informative representations of graphs in an end-to-end manner. Graph convolutional networks (GCNs) have extended the theory of signal processing on graphs [9] to enable the representation learning power of CNNs to be applied to irregular graph data. GCNs generalize the convolution operation to non-Euclidean graph data. The graph convolutional operation aims to generate representations for vertices by aggregating the features of a given vertex with the features of its neighbours. The relationship-aware representations generated by GCNs greatly enhance the discriminative power of CNN features, and the improved model interpretability can help clinicians to determine, for example, the parts of the brain that are most involved in one particular task. The popularity of the rapidly growing field of deep learning on GNNs is also reflected by the numerous recent surveys on graph representations and their applications. Existing reviews provide a comprehensive overview of deep learning for non-Euclidean data, graph deep learning frameworks and a taxonomy of existing techniques [4, 10] or introduce general applications that cover biology and signal processing domains [11] [12] [13] .",

Spherical CNN architectures can render valid parametrizations in a spherical space without introducing spatial distortions on the sphere (spherical mapping) [21] , and geometric features can be augmented by utilizing surface registration methods [22] . GCNs can also offer more flexibility to parcellate the cerebral cortex (surface segmentation) by providing better generalization on target-domain datasets where surface data are aligned differently, without the need for manual annotations or explicit alignment of these surfaces [23] .",

Traditional deep learning segmentation approaches classify each pixel of an image into a class by extracting high-level semantic features. CNNs struggle because regions in images are rarely grid-like and require non-local information. Compared with these pixel-wise methods, a graph-based method learns and regresses the location of the vessels and organs directly, and allows the model to learn local spatial structures [24, 25] . GCNs can also propagate and exchange local information across the whole image to learn the semantic relationships between objects.",

They assume a node in a graph constantly exchanges information/messages with its neighbours until a stable equilibrium is reached. In a deep learning model, RNNs introduce the notion of time by including recurrent edges that span adjacent time steps [48] . RNNs perform the same task for every element of a sequence, with the output being dependent on the previous computations and is therefore termed recurrent. LSTMs [49] were proposed to increase the flexibility of RNNs by employing an internal memory, termed the cell state, to address the vanishing gradient problem. Three logic gates are also introduced to adjust the cell state and produce the LSTM output. GRUs [50] are a variant of LSTMs which combines the forget and input gates to simplify the model. DCRNN model: Diffusion convolutional recurrent neural networks (DCRNNs) [51] introduce the diffusion graph convolutional layer to capture spatial dependencies, and uses a sequence-to-sequence architecture with GRUs to capture temporal dependencies. A DCRNN uses a graph diffusion convolution layer to process the inputs of a GRU such that the recurrent unit receives historic information from the last time step as well as neighbourhood information from the graph convolution. The advantage of a DCRNN is its ability to handle long-term dependencies because of the recurrent network architectures.",

TCNNs use dilated causal convolutional layers where an output at time t is convolved only with elements from time t or earlier in the previous layer, i.e., inputs have no influence on output steps that precede them in time. In a dilated convolutional layer, a filter is sequentially applied to inputs by skipping input values with a pre-defined step (dilatation rate). Wu et al. [58] proposed a method for multi-resolution modeling of temporal dependencies; their temporal model is based on dilated convolutions. This approach is based on the fact that subsequent layers have dilated receptive fields. Temporal graph convolutional networks (TGCN) take structural times series data as input and apply feature extraction operations that are shared over both time and space. TGCNs show promise in applications such as EEG electrode distributions, where several datasets of similar but not identical configurations need to be analyzed.",

The model converts the EEG into graph signals with appropriate graph structures and signal features as input to GCNs to identify the visual stimulus watched by a human subject. Compared to f MRI signals, EEG analysis is limited to observing a smaller number of brain regions (i.e., electrodes) which may not allow for a sufficiently rich graph representation. Thus, the authors create a graph containing both intra-band and inter-band connectivity. This proposed approach is illustrated in Figure 6 . Defining the graph connectivity structure for a given task is an ongoing problem and current models still have the limitation that appropriate graph structures need to be manually designed. To address this, Jang et al. [81] proposed an EEG classification model that can determine an appropriate multi-layer graph structure and signal features from a collection of raw EEG signals and classify them. In contrast to approaches that use a pre-defined connectivity structure, this method for learning the graph structure enhances classification accuracy. ",

Mathur et al. [84] presented a method for detecting ictal activity using a visibility graph on the EEG by employing a Gaussian kernel function to assign edge weight. A graph discrete Fourier transform is also applied to obtain features which are used in the classification phase. Some works have proven the relationship between epilepsy and EEG components on certain frequencies, and this frequency-domain representation can generate highly interpretable results. Wang et al. [59] introduced a sequential GCN that preserves the sequential information in 1D signals. The model is based on a complex network that represents a 1D signal as a graph [95] , in which each data point corresponds to a node and each edge is computed by a connection rule. The authors first transform the time-domain signal using a fast Fourier transform to produce a sequence of frequency-domain features that are aligned in the time domain, from which they develop a graph representation. Then, a GCN is adopted to learn features from the input network to improve the classification performance. By combining the frequency-domain network representation with the GCN, the model can detect conventional seizures in the Bonn dataset [85] , and a seizure type known as absence epilepsy from a private dataset. However, multi-channel EEG signals were not considered in the experimental setup. Covert et al. [86] proposed a temporal graph convolutional network (TGCN) which consists of feature extractors that are localized and shared over both time and space. TGCN is inherently invariant to when and where the patterns occur.

First, a graph-based representation with its corresponding node-level embedding is extracted from 10-second windows of EEG signals fed through a GCN model. Then, a graph-level embedding is computed using an averaging operation, the output of which is input into a fully connected network to obtain the output class. Finally, a maximum likelihood estimation based on the window-level prediction is adopted to determine if the entire EEG recording was recorded from a particular patient (i.e., subject prediction). Results on two large-scale scalp EEG databases, TUH EEG corpus [89] and MPI LEMON [90] , significantly outperform traditional machine learning models. The authors also evaluated the effect of depth on GCNs, and find higher depth offers only a marginal improvement in performance. However, the data from patients and control participates were collected using different systems which may help to distinguish both classes and a feature engineering phase was considered which limits the model's ability to directly discover the optimal features from the data.",

Sleep staging analysis is conducted through the analysis of electro-graphic measurements of the brain, eye movement, chin muscles, cardiac and respiratory activity, and is collected with a polysomnography (PSG). The manual determination of sleep stages on PSG records is a complex, costly, and problematic process that requires expertise. Although traditional CNN and RNN models can achieve high accuracy for automatic sleep stage classification, the models ignore the connections among brain regions and capturing the transition between sleep stages continues to be challenging. Sleep experts identify one sleep stage according to both EEG patterns and the class label of its neighbours. To address these challenges, Jia et al. [45] adopted an adaptive graph connection representation with attention, ST-GCN [46] , for automatic sleep stage classification and to capture sleep transition rules temporally. First, the pairwise relationship between nodes (EEG channels) is constructed dynamically; then, a ST-GCN model with attention is adopted to extract both spatial and temporal features. Experimental results in classifying five sleep stages on the PSG dataset MASS-SS3 [94] achieves the best performance compared to SVM, CNN and RNN baselines.",

First, feature representation and multi-task feature selection are applied to each input. Then, a graph was developed using imaging and non-imaging (phenotypic measures of each subject) data. Finally, a GCN was used to perform the EMCI identification task from the ADNI dataset [100] .",

The self-attention mechanism in GAT is used to compute the importance of graph vertices in a neighbourhood, allowing for a weighted sum of the vertices' features during pooling. The results of combining diffusion and anatomical data from the PPMI dataset [109] with the proposed model outperforms baseline algorithms on the features constructed from the diffusion data alone. The GAT attention layer also enables the possibility to interpret the magnitude of each node's attention weight as the relative importance of a brain area for discriminating PD participants. Current brain network methods either ignore the intrinsic graph topology or are designed for a single modality. To address these challenges, Zhang et al. [47] proposed a graph representation to fuse functional (f MRI) and structural brain networks (MRI). The cross-modality relationships and encoding is generated by an encoder-decoder process. The authors adopted the idea of the GAT model for a dynamic adjustment of the weights. Here, three aggregation mechanisms are dynamically combined (graph attention weight, the original edge weight, and the binary weight) through a multi-stage graph convolutional kernel. This model achieves the best prediction performance compared to CNN-based and graph-based approaches. The model is capable of localizing 10 key regions associated with PD classification via a saliency map (e.g., the bilateral hippocampus and basal ganglia which are structures conventionally conceived as PD biomarkers).",

[118] introduced a label co-occurrence learning framework based on GCNs to find dependencies between pathologies from chest X-ray imaging. This framework consists of two modules, an image feature embedding module that learns high-level features from images and a label co-occurrence learning module that classifies different pathology categories. In the framework which is illustrated in Figure 7 , each pathology is illustrated with semantic vectors via a word embedding, and the graph representation is learned from the cooccurrence matrix of training data. The classifiers are combined with image-level features to adaptively revise prediction beliefs for each pathology in two large-scale chest X-ray datasets, ChestX-ray14 [119] and CheXpert [120] . Although this approach models the correlations among disease labels, the utilization of medical reports paired with radiology images was not covered. Zhang et al. [117] adapted attention mechanisms and GCNs to learn graph embedded features to improve classification and report generation. In this approach, a CNN feature extractor and attention mechanism are used to compute initial node features. Then, a graph is developed with prior knowledge on chest findings to learn discriminatory features and the relationship between them for classifying disease findings. Each node in the graph corresponds to a finding category. Once the classification network is trained, a twolevel decoder with recurrent units (LSTMs) is trained to generate reports. The decoder learns to attend to different findings on the graph, and focuses on one concept in each sentence. The performance demonstrated with the IU-RR dataset [115] indicates that graphs with prior knowledge help to generate more accurate reports. Hou et al. [114] employed a transformer encoder as the feature-fusion model of both visual features and label embeddings (semantic features pre-trained on large free-text medical reports). These features are fed to a GCN model which is built as the knowledge graph to model the correlations among different thoracic diseases. The graph is constructed by a data-driven method from medical reports, with primary and auxiliary nodes that correspond to disease labels and other medical labels, respectively. However, its extension to handle other domains is limited because the graph is not built automatically.",

Zhang et al. [121] fused a CNN pipeline with a GCN pipeline to attain superior performance in classifying six abnormal types in the mini-MIAS dataset [122] . First, a CNN extracts individual image-level features; then, a GCN estimates a relation-aware representation. These features are combined via a dot product and a linear projection with trainable weights. This framework is illustrated in Figure 8 . Although the proposed model achieves high accuracy when analysing mammographic data, further optimization on larger datasets was not considered and other combination mechanisms of GCN and CNN should be assessed. In clinical practice, experts review medical images by zooming into ROIs for a closeup examination. Thus, Du et al. [123] model the zoom-in mechanism of radiologists' operation with a hierarchical graph-based model to detect abnormal lesions with full field digital mammogram (FFDM) images from the INbreast dataset [124] . A pre-trained CNN trained on lesion patches is used to extract features and a GAT model classifies nodes to predict whether to zoom or not into the next level to predict a benign or malignant mammogram. By adding the zoom-in mechanism, model interpretability is improved. However, the INbreast dataset is relatively small making this method difficult to assess, and a new loss is required to supervise the zoom-in mechanism.",

Multiple instance learning has been used to estimate instance-level classification probabilities and fuse them to generate a baglevel classification probability, but correlation between instances has not been well explored. To improve these methods, Yin et al. [125] introduced a graph-based methodology to detect children with congenital anomalies of the kidneys and urinary tract in 2D US images. A CNN is used to learn informative US image features at the instance level and a GCN is used as a permutation-invariant operator to further optimize the instance-level CNN features by exploring potential correlations among different instances of the same bag. The authors also adopted attention-based multiple instance learning pooling to learn a bag-level classifier using an instance-level supervision to enhance the learning of instance features and the bag-level classification.",

Relative Brain Age Predicted brain age is a meaningful index that characterises the current status of brain development which may be associated with functional brain abilities in the future. Measurements of morphological changes, including sulcal depth and cortical thickness, can be key features for brain age prediction. Traditional approaches applied to surface morphological features have not taken into account the topology of surfaces, which is defined with meshes. Therefore, CNN-based methods may not be appropriate for the analysis of cortical surface data. A relative brain age has been used as a metric computed as the predicted age minus the true age of the subject. Liu et al. [126] exploited the brain mesh topology as a sparse graph to predict brain age from MRIs for preterm neonates using vertex-wise cortical thicknesses and sulcal depth as input to a GCN. This model enables the convolutional filtering of input features through the surface topology in the context of spectral graph theory. The GCN predicted the ages of preterm neonates better than machine learning and deep learning methods that did not use surface topological knowledge. The authors also generated cortical sub-meshes that represent brain regions to predict which region estimates the age more accurately, and if they are associated with brain functional abilities in the future. As discussed previously in the subsection of AD analysis, Gopinath et al. [20, 36] also demonstrated their adaptive graph convolution pooling in a regression problem where the brain age is estimated using the geometry of the brains with point-wise surface-based measurements. The model is trained using data labeled as normal cognition from the ADNI dataset [100] , and the graph model uses cortical thickness, sulcal depth and spectral information to predict the brain age.",

A GCN learns the nonlinear mapping from the sub-sampled to full DW image, and spatio-angular relationships are considered when constructing the graph. To improve perceptual quality, the GCN is employed as the generator in a generative adversarial network. The same authors [132] proposed a super-resolution reconstruction framework based on an orthogonal undersampling scheme to increase complementary information within the under-sampled DW volume. The set of wave-vectors is divided into three subsets of scan directions (axial, coronal, or sagittal) and they are fitted to individual GCNs. A refinement GCN is used to generate the final DW volume by considering the correlation across scan directions as illustrated in Figure 9 . These graph-based methods outperform traditional interpolation methods and 3D UNet based reconstruction methods. Kim et al. [129] introduced a graph-based model for longitudinal prediction of DMRI data by considering the relationship between sampling points in the spatial and angular domains, i.e., a graph-based representation of the spatio-angular space. Then, the authors implemented a residual learning architecture with graph convolutions to capture brain longitudinal changes to predict missing DMRI data over time in a patch-wise manner. The proposed model showed improved performance in predicting missing DMRI data from neonate images so that longitudinal analysis can be performed. Hong et al. [130] also proposed a GCN-based method for predicting missing infant brain DMRI data. This model exploits information from the spatial domain and diffusion wave-vector domain jointly for effective prediction. Generative adversarial networks (GANs) are also adopted to better model the nonlinear prediction mapping and performance improvement. Here, the generator estimates the source image and the discriminator distinguishes the source image from the estimated one, where the generator is the GCN and the discriminator is developed via consecutive graph convolutional layers. However, the model cannot predict missing DMRI data for arbitrary time points.",

Spectral GCNs cannot be used to compare multiple graphs directly and need an explicit alignment of graph eigenbases as an additional pre-processing step. Thus, Gopinath et al. [23] proposed an adversarial graph domain adaptation method for surface segmentation. This approach focused on generalizing parcellation across multiple brain surface domains by eliminating the dependency on domain-specific alignment. In this approach, two networks are trained in an adversarial manner, a fully-convolutional GCN segmentator and a GCN domain discriminator. These networks operate on the spectral components of surface graphs as illustrated in Figure 10 . The authors also demonstrate that the model could be useful for semi-supervised surface segmentation, by that alleviating the need for large numbers of labeled surfaces. Zhao et al. [19] suggested a convolution filter on a sphere, termed Direct Neighbor, which is used to develop surface convolution, pooling and transposed convolution in spherical space. The authors extend the UNet architecture to spherical surface domains as illustrated in Figure 11 . The spherical UNet is efficient in learning useful features to predict cortical surface parcellation and cortical attribute map development. Although the method does not rely on spherical registration, it still needs to map cortical surfaces onto a sphere. Spherical mapping is susceptible to topological noise and cortical surfaces are required to be topologically correct before mapping. Therefore, Wu et al. [21] proposed to parcellate the cerebral cortex on the original cortical surface manifold without the need for spherical mapping by taking advantage of the high learning potential of GCNs (i.e., the model is free of spherical mapping and registration). The GCN receives intrinsic patches from the original cortical surface manifold that are mapped using the intrinsic local coordinate system. The extracted intrinsic patches are then combined with the trained models to predict parcellation labels. Figure 11 . Spherical UNet architecture. The output surface is a cortical parcellation map or a cortical attribute map, and the blue boxes reflect feature maps in spherical space. Note that all spherical surfaces in this figure have the same real size. Image adapted from [19] .",

Quantifying morphological changes in the chest can indicate the presence and stage of related diseases (e.g., bronchial stenosis). Unlike spheroid-like organs such as liver and kidney, tree-like airways are divergent, thin and tenuous. GNNs were investigated as a way to integrate neighbourhood information in feature utilization for mapping airwaves in the lungs [8, 41] . Juarez et al. [41] explored the application of GCNs to improve the segmentation of tubular structures like airways. The authors designed a UNet-GNN architecture by replacing the convolutional layers at the deepest level of the 3D-UNet with a GCN module. The GNN module uses a graph structure obtained from the dense feature maps resulting from the contracting path of the UNet. The GNN learns variations of the input feature maps based on the graph topology, and then outputs a new graph with the same nodes as the input graph, as well as a vector of learnt features for each node. These output feature maps are fed to the up-sampling path of the UNet as illustrated in Figure 12 . By introducing a GCN, the method is able to learn and combine information from a larger region of CT chest scans, and is evaluated on the Danish Lung Cancer Screening trial dataset [159] . Selvan et al. [8] also used this volumetric dataset to explore the extraction of treestructures with a focus on airway extraction, formulated as a graph refinement task, extending the authors' own prior work [160] . The input image data are first processed to create a graph-like representation, which consists of nodes containing information derived from local image neighbourhoods. Then, a GCN predicts the refined subgraph that corresponds to the structure of interest in a supervised setting, where edge probabilities are predicted from learnt edge embeddings. However, the proposed work treats graph structure learning to be an expensive approximation of a combinatorial optimization problem.",

In MRIs of low contrast and resolution, volume effects appear where individual voxels contain different tissues which makes brain tissue segmentation challenging. From several methods in the literature, voxelwise MRI image segmentation approaches neglect the spatial information within data. As brain MRIs consist of approximately piecewise constant regions, they are well suited to supervoxel generation which has been increasingly used for high dimensional 3D brain MRI volumes. Yan et al. [161] proposed a segmentation model based on GCNs. First, supervoxels from the brain MRI volume are generated; then, a graph is developed from these supervoxels with the k-nearest neighbour algorithm used to identify the nodes. Finally, a GCN is adopted to classify supervoxels into different types of tissue such as cerebrospinal fluid, grey matter, and white matter. This framework is illustrated in Figure 13 . Figure 13 . Supervoxels are generated from the brain MRI volume. A graph is constructed from these supervoxels with KNNs. A GCN is employed to classify supervoxels into different types of tissue.

However, the limitations of expert example annotation and the inter-patient variability of anatomical structures may lead to potential errors in the model prediction. The incorporation of a post-processing refinement phase is a traditional approach to improve the segmentation results. This additional knowledge about the accuracy of the prediction may be helpful in the process. Related to this idea, CNN uncertainty estimation has been used as an attention mechanism for finding potentially misclassified regions for segmentation refinement [183] . Soberanis-Mukul et al. [172, 173] proposed a semi-supervised graph learning problem operating over CT data for pancreas and spleen segmentation refinement task. First, a Monte Carlo dropout process is applied to a CNN (2D UNet) to extract the model's expectation and uncertainty which are used to divide the CNN output into high confidence points (i.e., to find incorrectly estimated elements). This process is represented by a binary mask indicating voxels with high uncertainty. Then, these confidence predictions are used to train a GCN in a semi-supervised way with partially-labeled nodes to refine (reclassify) the output of the CNN. The authors investigated various connectivity and weighting mechanisms to construct the graph. A sparse representation is established that takes into account local and long-range relations between high and low uncertainty elements. Gaussian kernels are used to define the weights for the edges considering the intensity and the 3D position associated with the node. Results on pancreas [174] and MSD-spleen [175] datasets show better performance over traditional CNN prediction with conditional random field refinement.",

Accurate segmentation of the prostate has several applications in the management of this disease. However, it is difficult to develop a fully automatic prostate segmentation method that can address various issues, such as variations of shape and appearance patterns in basal and apical regions. Tian et al. [25] proposed an interactive GCN-based prostate segmentation method for MRI. The method is similar to Curve-GCN [184] and adopts a GCN to obtain the coordinates of the contour vertices by regression. The graph module takes the output feature from the CNN encoder applied to the cropped image as its input. Then, the coordinates of a fixed number of vertices from the initial contour are adjusted to fit the target. The interactive GCN model improves the accuracy by correcting the points on the prostate contour with user interactions. Finally, neighbouring points/vertices are connected with spline curves to form the prostate contour. The model outperforms several state-of-the-art segmentation methods on the PROMISE12 dataset [176] .",

As demonstrated throughout this review, graph-based deep learning has attracted significant attention for the analysis of medical data through graph representations of functional connectivity, anatomical structures and electrical activity. However, there are challenges associated with their adoption in this domain that merit further discussion. Advances addressing these challenges would permit GNNs to be extended to a broader variety of domains and applications in circumstances where traditional 2D grid representations are limited. We discuss five major challenges that need to be addressed to unlock the full power of graph deep learning: (1) Graph representation; (2) Dynamicity and temporal graphs; (3) Training paradigms and complexity of graph models; (4) Generalization of graph models and deployment; (5) Explainability and interpretability.",

Another interesting variant of transfer learning is zero-shot learning (ZSL), which aims to predict the correct class without being exposed to any instances belonging to that class in the training dataset.

Recently, GCNs have shown a lot of promise for zero-shot learning. When encountered with a lack of data, these models are highly sample efficient because related concepts in the graph structure share statistical strength, allowing generalization to new classes [220] .

Clinical areas bring additional requirements such as the incorporation of the physician's interpretation (i.e., to satisfy a meaningful explanation, the model should \"explain\" its output in such a way that physicians can understand). Interpretability for graph-based deep learning is significantly more challenging than for CNN or RNN-based models because graph nodes and edges are often heavily interconnected.

Post-hoc explanation techniques have been used to visualize attention weights or to recognize relevant subgraphs for classification. Such explanation techniques have been useful, for example, to identify brain regions that are most involved when a seizure occurs [59, 86] , and key brain regions associated with biomarkers for PD [47] or ASD [16, 17, 61] prediction. The activation map and gradient sensitivity of graph models are also used to interpret the salient input features at both the group and individual levels for the analysis of BD [44] and ASD [61] . Both individual-level and group-level explanations are critical in medical research. Individual-level biomarkers are desirable for planning targeted care in precision medicine, while group-level biomarkers are essential for understanding disease-specific characteristic patterns. Although attention weights for edges can be used to measure edge importance, it is noted that they can only explain GAT models without explaining node features, unlike, for example, GNNExplainer [223] .",

Our survey provides a comprehensive review of research on graph neural networks and their application to medical domains and applications including functional connectivity, electrical, and anatomical analysis. Digital pathology has not been the main focus of this survey, and we have sparsely mentioned the applications of GCNs to this domain. However, considering the comprehensive application of deep learning to digital pathology (WSI), readers are referred to a complementary survey that thoroughly covers the potential applications of GCN to WSI [26] .",

However, we have outlined several challenges related to their adoption, including the graph representation and estimation, graph complexity, dynamicity, interpretability and generalization of graphs. These and many other challenges lead to a vast amount of open research directions, the solutions to which will benefit the field and lead to many applications in the medical domain. This constitutes a clear challenge to the neuroengineering scientific community, and it is hoped that the community will increase their efforts to address these emerging challenges. Although one will never replace the power of individual clinical expertise, by providing more quantitative evidence and appropriate decision support, one can definitely improve medical decisions and ultimately the standard of care provided to patients.
