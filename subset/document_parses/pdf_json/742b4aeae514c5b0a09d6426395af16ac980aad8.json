            "text": "The recent resolution revolution triggered by the development of direct electron detectors and other technical advances has allowed cryo-EM to break the previous resolution barrier(s) and led to exponential growth of near-atomic cryo-EM structures. 1, 2 More recently, several studies have achieved atomic-resolution cryo-EM reconstruction using either the next-generation hardware or the most up-to-date commercially available setup. [3] [4] [5] Aside from single-particle analysis (SPA) that has gained tremendous popularity, other cryo-EM approaches have also benefited from the revolution, such as cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET), 6, 7 micro-electron diffraction (MicroED) 8 , and cryo-scanning transmission electron microscopy (cryo-STEM). 9 Because cryo-EM SPA is featured by minimal amount of specimen under near-native crystal-free condition, automated data collection with continually increasing throughput, 10 and comprehensive data processing pipelines capable of resolving structural heterogeneity, 11 it has become a widely adopted structural biology technique for structural biologists whose portfolio used to have only X-ray crystallography and NMR. Whereas the above features make SPA particularly useful to determine structures of larger proteins and protein complexes (>200 kDa), additional technical advances, especially the development of Volta phase plate (VPP), 12 have pushed the limit of protein molecular weight to as low as 52 kDa for structure determination by SPA. 13 Readers interested in technical developments and current challenges in SPA are directed to a number of comprehensive reviews for further details. 11, [14] [15] [16] RNA plays an essential role in various important biological processes by folding and sustaining a three-dimensional (3D) structure in order to perform functions such as catalysis and gene regulation. [17] [18] [19] It is estimated that about 85% of the human genome is transcribed into RNA, 20 with more than 80% of the genome estimated to be biologically and functionally relevant, 21 however, only 1.5 percent of the genome encodes proteins. 21, 22 In the Protein Data Bank (wwPDB), there are currently 183980 depositions of protein complexes, which has facilitated the development of accurate protein structure prediction algorithms. 23 In contrast to our apparently better understanding of protein structures and functions, our knowledge of RNA structures remains scarce. There are currently 1569 protein-free RNA and 9790 protein-nucleic acid complex structures deposited in the PDB that accounts for only about 6% of the entire PDB deposition (Fig.  1a) . The lack of RNA structures is most likely due to the intrinsic heterogeneity of RNAs caused by flexible ribose and phosphate backbone, weak long-range tertiary interactions, alternative conformations, and dynamics among multiple functional states, which pose great challenges to X-ray crystallography to obtain RNA crystals with high-resolution diffraction information, and to NMR to solve structures of RNAs larger than 100 nucleotides (100 nt). 24, 25 Although cryo-EM SPA has extended our accessibility to more challenging biological structures and systems, proteinfree RNA structures accrue at a much slower rate compared to proteins and protein-nucleic acid complexes in the Electron Microscopy Data Bank (EMDB). To date, there are only three protein-free RNA cryo-EM structures determined at 4 \u00c5 or better resolution (Table 1) , which accounts for 0.02% of the entire 17349 depositions in EMDB (Fig. 1b) .",

This review summarizes recent efforts that overcome these challenges and enrich the proteinfree RNA cryo-EM structure repertoire, including new approaches to obtain stable RNA structures for cryo-EM SPA and integration of multiple techniques to facilitate structural analysis when resolution is moderate.

            "text": "NEW APPROACHES TO OBTAIN STABLE RNA STRUCTURES FOR SPA RNA X-ray crystallography utilizes strategies that introduce proteins such as U1A and L7Ae to bind to specific RNA motifs to stabilize RNA crystal lattices. 30, 31 Group II introns are ribozymes with endogenous protein partners that stabilize the dynamic RNA structures and facilitate RNA catalysis. 32, 33 The analogous approach has been reported by Qu et al. in the cryo-EM structure of the Lactococcus lactis LtrB group II intron in complex with its intron-encoded protein LtrA at 3.8 \u00c5 (Fig. 2a) , in which they utilize a 60 kDa RNA binding protein LtrA to stabilize the RNA structure and resolve 704 nt (216 kDa) of the 902 nt LtrB using cryo-EM SPA. 34 Intriguingly, 3D classification yielded one minor class that resembled the LtrB intron alone with four times fewer particles than the LtrB-LtrA RNP, which generated a protein-free RNA structure at 4.5 \u00c5. The disordered LtrA binding site in LtrAdepleted RNA structure validates the role of LtrA to assist folding and to enhance the stability of LtrB intron structure as previously described. 34 , 35 Bonilla and colleagues used cryo-EM SPA to solve the viral tRNA-like structure (TLS) of bromo mosaic virus (BMV) at 4.3 \u00c5 resolution. 36 Unexpectedly, the \"tRNA-like\" L-shape was not readily observed in protein-free BMV TLS. Comparison of the TLS alone with the complex structure of TLS and tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase (TyrRS) indicates that TLS undergoes drastic conformational changes to resemble \"tRNA-like\" shape in order to bind to TyrRS. This is a great example illustrating the importance of studying protein-free RNAs to provide insights of required conformational rearrangement upon protein binding.",

            "text": "Kappel et al. recently developed an accelerated RNA structure determination workflow, named \"Ribosolve\" (Fig. 3a) , that integrates native gel analysis, mutate-and-map by next generation sequencing (M2-seq), cryo-EM SPA, and auto-DRRAFTER RNA modeling. 38 In this workflow, native gel analysis enables quick identification of optimal RNA refolding conditions. RNAs that form sharp bands in native gels are subjected to M2-seq experiments, 39 in which secondary structures are determined to both assess the homogeneity of folded RNA structures and to assist RNA modeling. Cryo-EM SPA allowed the rapid determination of 11 previously unknown RNA structures at resolution ranging from 4.7 to 10 \u00c5, which revealed explicit RNA features of major and minor grooves. Seven structures were determined with VPP for contrast enhancement. Finally, auto-DRRAFTER was developed based on the previous DRRAFTER 40 to utilize secondary structures determined by M2-seq to build 3D RNA models guided by cryo-EM density, because de novo RNA modeling can be very challenging under such resolution. The estimated coordinate root mean square deviation (RMSD) accuracy was between 3.3 and 6.3 \u00c5 as predicted by modeling convergence, which is sufficient for revealing RNA overall fold. This workflow enables accelerated RNA cryo-EM structure determinations by introducing methods to Cryo-EM-guided RNA structure determination. a \"Ribosolve\" utilizes native gel analysis, secondary structure information, cryo-EM maps at moderate resolution, and RNA modeling algorithm to generate RNA models. b Cryo-EM maps at moderate resolution that do not allow de novo modeling can be combined with structural information determined by other techniques like X-ray crystallography, NMR and SAXS examine RNA folding and structural homogeneity, which can be used both to assist RNA modeling and to guide additional cryo-EM data collection for improved resolution. A few applications of the \"Ribosolve\" workflow have been reported. SAM-IV riboswitch, a 40 kDa RNA that recognizes S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), 41 was initially resolved to 7 \u00c5 resolution using cryo-EM SPA with VPP. Zhang et al. continued to collect additional cryo-EM data and achieved 3.7 \u00c5 resolution for the apo state and 4.1 \u00c5 for the SAM-bound state allowing unambiguous ligand recognition. 42 The final data sets that generated cryo-EM structures of both states at near-atomic resolution were collected without VPP. This is likely because the stronger electron scattering of phosphate backbones has provided sufficient contrast for visualization of this small RNA. At 3.7 \u00c5 resolution, only a portion of the base pairs is resolved, indicating that higher resolution is required to allow de novo modeling. Nonetheless, this study has demonstrated the capability of cryo-EM SPA to facilitate structure determination at near-atomic resolution for RNA that is beyond the current molecular weight limit of 52 kDa for protein. 13 Recently, Su and colleagues solved the cryo-EM structures of fulllength Tetrahymena ribozyme in both apo and substrate-bound states at 3.1 \u00c5 resolution. 43 Group I self-splicing intron of Tetrahymena thermophila was discovered as the first ribozyme and has since become an unprecedented model system to study RNA catalysis and structure-function relationship. However, the fulllength Tetrahymena ribozyme structure remains unknown for 40 years. After a 6.8 \u00c5 cryo-EM map of the apo L-21 Tetrahymena ribozyme map was obtained by \"Ribosolve\", more data was collected to achieve a 3.1 \u00c5 cryo-EM structure, in which the complete peripheral region was explicitly resolved and two previously unforeseen tertiary interactions that allosterically regulate catalysis were identified. The substrate-bound state revealed catalytic mechanism, conformational changes of the internal guide sequence, and local shifts of phosphate, nucleobase, and metal ions upon substrate binding. This study provided a complete structural view of the Tetrahymena ribozyme and a great example of dissecting the RNA structure-function relationship by cryo-EM.",

As more RNA cryo-EM structures are determined with continuously improving resolution, radiation damage and optimal exposure on RNA cryo-EM structures need to be assessed in order to guide optimal electron dose in cryo-EM data collection. For example, if RNA is less susceptible to radiation damage, higher total electron doses could be used in RNA cryo-EM SPA to enhance image contrast and SNR which will lead to attenuation of alignment errors. This may reduce the B-factor since small particles like RNAs are particularly sensitive to alignment errors. 57 A number of other factors may have an impact on the B-factor, such as ice thickness, beam-induced motion (BIM), and intrinsic heterogeneity of the RNA molecules. To eliminate ice thickness variations, in which thicker ice will lead to decreased image contrast and SNR, novel sample preparation instruments have been developed and are currently optimized to reproducibly generate thin ice. For example, \"Spotiton\" can deliver as little as a few nanoliters of samples onto the grid while it plunges. 58 The reduced time window between spotting and plunging also attenuates the air-water interface problem, 59 which causes other issues in SPA such as preferred orientation and sample denaturation (reviewed elsewhere 60 ).",

The resulting lower contrast and SNR of each frame can be potentially compensated by VPP or weighted denoising algorithms that should theoretically enhance SNR at low spatial frequencies. 65, 66 RNA may naturally adopt higher B-factor than protein due to its intrinsic heterogeneity and dynamics. Structural study is primarily facilitated by the identification of RNAs with conformational homogeneity and stable 3D structures, as demonstrated by native gel analysis and M2-seq in the \"Ribosolve\" workflow. 37 Additional information from computational analysis, such as phylogenetic analysis and predictions of long-range tertiary interactions (e.g. pseudoknot formations, minor-groove interactions, etc.) will further enable the identification of conformational homogeneous RNAs with stable 3D structures. 17, 67 It is noteworthy that cryo-EM provides the unique opportunity of resolving conformational heterogeneity.
