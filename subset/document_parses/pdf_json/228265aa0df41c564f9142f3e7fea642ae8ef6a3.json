Representative case vignettes are used to show how the framework can be applied to real world healthcare problems, including clinical space testing, process development, and culture. Finally, future directions for translational simulation are discussed.

This testing may include tabletop mock-ups and full scale recreations of facilities, and involve individuals or teams 'working' within these test environments. The approach requires more than a single 'event', but rather an integrated programme for testing and data collection. Petrosoniak et al. propose a 'design thinking' approach-a suite of simulation techniques that emphasises end user engagement-to iteratively test and improve upon changes [19] . Similar iterative approaches to testing and embedding identified system issues were used during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, when many healthcare workflows and practices had to be rapidly adjusted to minimise infection risks [20] [21] [22] . Simulation strategies helped to explore risks of COVID-19 transmission in current practices and to test the feasibility and effectiveness of planned changes designed to reduce risks at the individual, team, and system level. 'Work as imagined' strategies [23] that had intuitive appeal-e.g. Perspex boxes to protect airway teams from exposure to COVID-19 during intubation [24, 25] -were not always feasible or effective when tested in simulated practice.",

Unlike traditional simulationbased education, which is focused on learning by individuals and small groups, translational simulation can promote organisational learning [28] by targeting improvements in systems' components and their relationships [29] . Translational simulation strategies are likely to have greater impact when they are integrated with an organisation's clinical governance and quality improvement processes, redesign and capital work planning, education and training, equipment procurement, and public relations. How this is achieved varies according to the context. In established systems, referrals may be made to a formalised translational simulation consultation service [30] . In the absence of an established programme, key representatives from each organisational unit may need to be approached on an ad hoc basis, and staff with relevant simulation expertise may be assigned by the organisation's executive to key projects, such as the transition to electronic health records or capital works development.",

Examples of important stakeholders to consider including are listed in Table 1 . 3. A strategy, not an event. Healthcare improvement requires an iterative approach. The IPO framework may create the illusion that translational simulation is rigid, linear, and stepwise in nature. In reality, new information is continually obtained as the translational simulation strategy develops, leading to iterative refinement of the input, process, and output phases. 4. Disciplined focus. While translational simulation activities may have elements of both diagnosis (determining what problems exist and their characteristics) and intervention (providing solutions to problems), goals are more likely to be achieved if they are narrow, specific, and well communicated to those designing and participating in the translational simulation activities. 5.

The modality and location of the simulation activities will vary depending on their purpose, guided by the principle of functional task alignment in a similar way to educationally focused simulation [49] . Scenarios should be peer reviewed and piloted prior to use. ii. Simulation delivery requires appropriate personnel-facilitators, debriefers, content experts, simulation operations and technical specialists, as well as support staff to help prepare and reset scenarios and equipment. Approaches will vary in different contexts. A common approach involves a dedicated simulation team engaging with clinicians from the relevant areas and with internal or external consultants with identified expertise in the issue. Ideally, the simulation participants are authentic clinical teams familiar with the problem being addressed and the context of the work environment. Any observers are carefully chosen to maintain the psychological safety of the participants and promote useful data collection (see below). Commonly, matched observers (e.g. a surgical nurse observing surgical nurse roles) and additional content experts (e.g. an information technology expert to observe electronic health record use) are valuable. The use of templates and checklists are recommended to ensure safety and efficiency of simulation design and delivery. iii. Learning conversations. As with any simulation activity, prebriefing and debriefing are critical for participants and observers to engage with the translational simulation process and to optimise the data collected. The prebriefing should clearly outline the purpose and objectives of the activity, what will be done with the findings, the roles of participants and observers, and establish a 'safe container' for everyone involved [50] . It should reinforce messages in any pre-reading sent to participants prior to the event. The debrief process should be tailored to purpose and the constraints of real clinical teams and time pressures. Rich data is often derived from well-conducted debriefs of participants and observers, so participants should understand their role in the wider translational simulation strategy.",

The clinical end users and the design team are unable to reach consensus on the design functionality but agree that simulation testing may help them resolve their differences. Projected translational simulation costs are incorporated into the project budget as part of the necessary design and commissioning costs. An ad hoc translational simulation team is formed, led by two trauma clinicians with Table 3 Considerations for the \"Output phase\" of translational simulation. This grid provides suggested reporting and dissemination methods (indicated by a \"black star\" symbol) according to the target audience of translational simulation outputs. The information content should also be tailored to the target audience experience in using in situ simulation to identify latent safety threats, combined with five staff from the hospital's simulation centre and a member of the design team. Simulations begin in the existing trauma bay to better understand the teams, their workflows, and their needs. Regular updates are presented to the project team during the translational simulation activities. Direct observation and movement tracking within the space [5] finds that the new space cannot accommodate an expansion to three trauma bays and that two bays are ergonomically optimal. Tabletop simulations followed by simulations within mock-ups of the space confirm other previously identified latent safety threats [51] . The process follows the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) evidence-based safe design principles [40] , and data from observations and debriefings are documented on the Simulation-based Quality Improvement Observation Tool (SQIOT) [14] by both observers and simulation facilitators. Data from the SQIOTs are collated, risk rated, and reported on a Healthcare Failure Modes Effects Analysis (HFMEA) summary report [15, 39] . Recommendations are provided in the HFMEA summary report, which is submitted to the project team and organisational leadership for action. Using this process, several 'blind spots' within the new space are identified that translate to tangible improvements. Specific changes include the addition of multiple vital sign monitors surrounding the clinical space, modular procedure carts to mitigate space limitations and floor markings to better delineate the clinical care environment. The presence of architects during the process enables a more efficient design process that meets the clinician and patient needs. Importantly, final state simulations validate the functionality of the implemented changes and ensure that the new clinical space is not first tested on patients.",

Focus groups, involving staff from anaesthesia and mental health, are conducted to understand the concerns these stakeholders have about the opening of this new service. The anaesthesia team identifies concerns about the possibility of airway emergencies in this 'remote' (i.e. non-operating theatre) context. A translational simulation strategy is designed and delivered in the new physical space prior to opening, with simulated patient actors and the relevant healthcare provider teams. Key design elements include a structured data collection process during the simulation and debrief-developed through a series of meetings with anaesthetists, mental health staff, and the hospital risk management unit. The decision is made to test the basic workflow with simulated patient actors prior to scenarios involving critical airway incidents. Minor issues are identified with the physical environment, but feedback from the simulated patients, who are involved in the debriefs, is of major concern. The proximity of the ECT suite next to the waiting patients means that they can hear all of the activity of ECT being delivered, and they find this frightening. The waiting area is moved prior to the service commencing. Subsequent scenarios testing the specific airway emergency protocol result in minor, iterative changes. Short (<10 min) 'mental rehearsal' simulations for airway crises are designed and run weekly at the start of the ECT list.

            "text": "The external translational simulation consultants work with an interprofessional obstetrics team from the host institution to define the problem with patient care. The institution undertakes an audit of PPH cases, together with the coronial findings and the root cause analysis of the critical incident, and baseline measure of blood transfusion rates for major PPH. A Relational Coordination Survey [6] is conducted to examine the strengths and weaknesses between and within teams involved in major PPH cases, which informs focus group discussions about how to improve performance. As a result, a translational simulation strategy is formulated to design, test, and embed a series of interventions, including a simplified guideline for major PPH, a 'STOP' handover moment after arrival in the operating theatre, and an 'Obstetric Haemorrhage Respond' call process. Desktop and walkthrough simulations are used to refine a prototype guideline. In collaboration with the hospital quality improvement unit, more than 40 live scenario-based simulations are used to further test and embed the guidelines, supported by educational sessions, infographics, and presentations at ward in-services. During these simulations, further 'diagnoses' are made-the need for a hospital massive transfusion protocol and the need for a clinical event debriefing programme within maternity services-leading to additional translational simulation projects. After 6 months, relational coordination is remeasured, and workplace surveys show an improvement in staff culture. Transfusion rates in PPH show a small, non-statistically significant decrease.",

Growth of translational simulation is partially predicated on demonstrable ROIs.

This involves co-opting simulation-based education resources, then using the outputs of these activities to convince their organisation of the value of the approach (e.g. ROI) and obtaining more resources to make translational simulation sustainable. Implementing translational simulation requires trained staff, governance structures, adequate technology and physical resources, and a profile within the organisation and/or broader health system. There may be a role for external consultation services in assisting organisations that lack translational simulation expertise or resources.
