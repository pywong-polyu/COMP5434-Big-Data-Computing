In adaptive designs, decisions to stop or adapt may be made at interim analyses according to accumulating evidence which, in some cases, can result in reduced sample sizes and cost. In addition, participants benefit from an increased chance of receiving a beneficial treatment. While adaptive designs in clinical trials go beyond Bayesian adaptive trials (Pallmann et al., 2018; Burnett et al., 2020) , Bayesian methods in adaptive trials have become popular. The main reasons for this popularity are that the Bayesian framework naturally accommodates sequential analysis of accumulating data and that the validity of Bayesian probability statements is not affected by small sample sizes or incorporation of stopping rules (Berry et al., 2010) .",

A brief introduction to this clinical trial is provided in Section 2. In early discussions among the team of investigators, the ordinal scale disease progression endpoint, as defined by the World Health Organization (WHO) (WHO, 2020), was considered as the primary endpoint of the trial with the goal of evaluating the effect of the intervention in reducing the severity of COVID-19. The Proportional Odds (PO) ordinal logistic regression was considered as the analysis model which is one of the simplest statistical models used for the analysis of the ordinal scale outcome (Harrell and Lindsell, 2020) . Bayesian inference for the PO model, however, requires MCMC sampling since the analytic form of the posterior is not available. Therefore, assessing DOCs for Bayesian trials with the ordinal scale outcome requires extensive simulations and carries a significant computational burden. The computational requirements, together with the uncertainty of the risk associated with the levels of the ordinal scale outcome, resulted in a simplification of the design that used a binary endpoint. This shifted the focus to the risk of infection rather than disease severitywhich was a necessary change to meet deadlines for funding applications and regulatory approvals dictated by the time-sensitive situation.",

The methodology can be employed in general for design of clinical trials where power analysis and assessing DOCs relies on simulations rather than analytic forms for the sampling distribution of the test statistic. The proposed approach is to estimate the sampling distribution of Bayesian probability statements i.e., the test statistics) through the model parameter space which is then used to provide computationally efficient estimates of DOCs for a wide range of assumptions and decision parameters without the need for additional simulations. A simple parametric density estimation approach is employed where the sampling distribution of the probability statement is assumed to follow a Beta distribution whose parameters are modelled as Gaussian processes (GP) with distancebased correlation structure across the parameter space. The GPs are trained over an initial set of simulated distributions for the test statistic at a select set of parameter values.",

In Section 3, we introduce a method for emulating and predicting the sampling distribution of a Bayesian test statistic using a beta prior distribution with GP parameters. We apply the proposed approach to the motivating example in Section 4. We also discuss the design of the training set for this application and assessment of estimation using cross-validation. Section 5 follows with a discussion of the limitations of the proposed approach and future extensions. Given the goal of the study, the ordinal scale disease progression outcome recommended by the WHO (WHO, 2020) was of interest. The clinical progression scale has ten disease progression level from uninfected to dead. The challenge in use of a ten-level endpoint in clinical trials is the lack of granular data to inform the base rate assumptions as well as the dimensionality of the parameter space in statistical inference. Therefore, simplifications of the 10-level ordinal scale that merge levels may be used. Table 1 shows the definition of the five-level ordinal scale disease progression endpoint with categories uninfected, mild disease, moderate disease, severe disease and dead.",

The PRO-TECT study adopted a Bayesian adaptive design that allowed for an interim analysis when 75% of (approximately 1000) patients completed their follow-up time (16 weeks).

In this article we propose a set of methods for estimating the sampling distribution of a Bayesian probability statement-used for decision making in Bayesian adaptive trials-over a model parameter space. Our goal is to estimate a variety of DOCs and to assess their sensitivity to trial assumptions and design configurations in an efficient manner. We take advantage of the spatial correlation throughout the model parameter space to interpolate the parameters of the sampling distribution. We model the parameters of the sampling distribution as independent GPs trained over a set of estimates obtained by simulating the trial design over an initial set of model parameter values.",

All existing methods create a non-Gaussian process prior over the original function for which analytic predictions conditional on GP parameters cannot be obtained.

The proposed approach relies on the 80-training-point simulation and therefore includes the 40 h of computation time. However, it takes about 20 s to fit each GP model (2 chains and 2000 iterations each), i.e., less than a minute in total. Sampling from the posterior predictive distribution for the test set takes about a minute. Therefore, the computation time for making predictions on the test set is reduced from 400 h to two min. To reduce the computation time via parallel computing alone to a comparable level would require significant computational resources (thousands of processing units). Of course, parallel computing together with the proposed methods can result in further reductions in computation times.",
