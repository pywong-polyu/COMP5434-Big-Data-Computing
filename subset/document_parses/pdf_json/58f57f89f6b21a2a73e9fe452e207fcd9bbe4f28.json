Lodging companies continue to add services to differentiate new select-service brands (Su and Reynolds 2019) . The latest trend in this segment has been the creation of midscale and upper-midscale lifestyle select-service brands. In 2019, 75% of all new hotel rooms were in the select-service segment, with select service hotels growing at a faster rate than the general lodging market (Hoisington 2019) . Caption by Hyatt, launched in 2019, focused on sustainability and large social spaces while Accor's select-service Greet focused on up-cycled furniture and locally sourced food (Kubacki 2019) . As lodging companies face an uncertain future after the COVID-19 pandemic, select-service properties are more likely to be built than their full-service counterparts (Wroten 2020) . As these new brands are launched, lodging companies strive to differentiate each brand from their existing brands and from different segments. The line between select-service and full-service brands, however, has become blurred with the addition of amenities such as two-meal restaurants at Courtyard by Marriott (Yapp 2015) .",

However, increasingly high profile marketing of select-service brands like the Hampton Inn and the increase in lifestyle select-service brands lie Vib by Best Western are designed to increase emotional attachment to these select-service brands. While consumers view full-service hotels as more exciting, their brand images are less distinct and harder to imagine than brand images for select-service hotels (Su and Reynolds 2019) . Investigations of pricing in select-service hotels have been limited to analyzing the accounting procedures and marketing theory behind revenue management (Mattimoe and Seal 2011) , and comparing the end value of room rates (i.e. 0.00 or 0.99) for full-service and select-service hotels (Collins and Parsa 2006) .",

While full-service guests are more likely to be members of loyalty programs and have a higher switching cost (Tanford et al. 2012) , prior research did not account for the fast-growing segment of select-services. Accordingly, this paper aims to investigate whether the price is indeed a determining factor between full-service hotels and select-service hotels. The current study also seeks to answer whether customers' evaluation of service attributes is different if pricing was not a determining factor between hotel market segments. By accomplishing the purposes of this study, this study provides a further understanding of customer behavior in the ever-changing hotel market.",

Then, online reviews for these hotels were coded and examined using multiple regression to evaluate if the same variables affect star-ratings for select-service and full-service hotels.

Customers look at price as an indicator of value when making selections, and their sensitivity to price is dictated by the market for a particular property as well as their range of acceptable prices for that market (Lewis and Shoemaker 1997) . According to Piercy et al. (2010) , \"the way prices are set not only influences demand, but price also shapes how buyers use the product or service and can have a lasting impact on customer relationships.\" Conversely, when consumers are faced with numerous options when booking online, the relative quality of the hotels is equalized and price sensitivity increases (Diehl et al. 2003) . The more choices a person has when booking, the more likely price will become a deciding factor (Arnold et al. 1989 ). This implies that for hotels, market segment becomes less of a factor when potential guests are looking at a long list of hotels on a third-party site. The current study questions the conventional wisdom of segmentation theory, with the contention that the segmentation of select-service and full-service hotels has become blurred as the select-service segment has evolved.",

Either way, brand and RevPAR have a relationship. Brand loyalty and willingness-to-pay have a complex relationship; guests close to changing their loyalty levels tend to have a greater willingnessto-pay (Mathies and Gudergan 2012) , while business travelers with high levels of attitudinal loyalty tend to be more price sensitive than those with lower levels of loyalty (Noone and McGuire 2016) .

The way hotels are priced, however, varies by hotel as there is no universally accepted pricing model for \"all hotels, at all times and in all places\" (Steed and Gu 2005) . Previous studies indicate that discounting does not positively contribute to RevPAR. Enz et al. (2009) found that hotels that priced their room 5-10% higher than the competition saw an increase in RevPAR while those who discounted had higher occupancy but with lower RevPAR. They also noted that the select-service hotels with food and beverage benefited less from discounting than other properties. Therefore, when a property is priced higher than its competitors, it may be a strategy to increase ADR, or it may be because it has higher demand.",

Select-service hotels have increased in popularity in city centers, with guests opting to use apps like UberEats to enjoy authentic, local food rather than full-service hotels. They are also more cost effective for owners. At the 2019, 70% of hotels in the U.S. pipeline were select-service hotels. In 2018-2019, the average cost of a full-service hotel was $390,000 per room while the average cost of a select-service hotel was $290,000 per room (Caufield 2020) . Select-service hotels also costs less to run because of the reduced need for staff. During the COVID-19 pandemic, select-service hotels were more resilient due to demand from first responders (JLL 2020), making them a more attractive shortterm investment.

Research into hotel pricing has found that pricing is related to both demand and online ratings, regardless of segment (Wang et al. 2019) . Additionally, guests are less likely to book hotels with high star-ratings if the price is discounted (Jang and Moutinho 2019), which indicates that user-generated star-ratings has more influence on room rate than segment.

When looking at resale value, in June 2013 a full-service Sheraton in Pittsburgh sold for $175,000 per key while a Courtyard in the same market sold for $226,000 per key (Schooley 2013) . In 2016, many in the industry were predicting the demise of full-service hotels, claiming that they had become obsolete. As evidence, many have cited the preference major hotel chains have shown for developing new select-service brands rather than new full-service brands, like Tru by Hilton, and Hyatt's focus on Hyatt Place and Hyatt House (Ting 2016) . These select-service hotels are preferred not only because of the cost to build them but because of the revenue they generate, and high occupancy for select-service hotels demonstrates that consumers value these properties as well. Furthermore, while consumers attribute distinct brand personalities to select-service hotels, their impressions of full-service hotels are much less distinct (Su and Reynolds 2019) .",

When the raters had questions during their evaluation process, a further explanation was provided. Once the raters fully comprehended how to assess the factors, the raters were asked to assign a specific value indicating how the review described the factor. Specifically, the reviews were coded 1 for a positive mention, -1 for a negative mention, and 0 if it was not mentioned. For example, a positive value of one was assigned if a reviewer mentioned, \"It was right by downtown/highway\", whereas a negative one was assigned for a review saying, \"The hotel was so far away from the attractions.\" Once the initial evaluation of reviews was completed, a second round assessment was conducted to ascertain the accuracy of review analysis. The assessment of the raters was compared to ensure a sufficient inter-rater reliability. While there was not much discrepancy between the two raters in their evaluation of 3,600 reviews, any discrepancies were resolved through a series of discussions so that the raters had a complete agreement.",

This, despite the similar or higher price of select-service hotels, consumers' expectation for select-service might be low, leading to higher customer satisfaction.",

Negative mentions of parking, bathroom, noise, room condition, restaurant, air conditioning/heating, cleanliness, and front desk service were statistically significant across all four brands by negatively influencing star-ratings. Positive mentions of the restaurant and front desk were statistically significant across all four brands by positively influencing star-ratings, noting that for the HIE and HP, the restaurant was the complimentary breakfast offered by those brands. Positive mentions of room condition were statistically significant for HI, HIE, but not for DT. Negative mentions of the restaurant were statistically significant for HI, DT, and HP but not for HIE. Negative mentions of location were significant for brands HI and HP and negative mentions of safety were significant for the full-service brands, HI and DT. In summary, Hypothesis 1 was fully supported, Hypothesis 2 was not supported, and Hypothesis 3 was partially supported. Hypothesis 3, which examined the antecedents of satisfaction for select-service and full-service hotels, found that brand was the only antecedent that had a different impact by segment. Our results demonstrate that negative brand mentions were significant for the fullservice brands and HP while positive brand mention was only significant for HP. This demonstrates that brand image affects star-ratings for online reviews. These results are discussed in detail in the next section.",

            "text": "Drawing on segmentation theory, this study researched the concept that two market segments within the lodging industry-select-service and full service-have begun to converge in terms of pricing and customer perception. Hypothesis 1 predicted that the room rate for select-service hotels would be equal to or higher than full-service properties. The results of the multi-level modelling indicated that segment was not significant while brand was when accounting for effects by city and length of time from the most recent remodel. Hypotheses 2 and 3 examined the impact of segmentation on user-generated star-ratings on TripAdvisor, Expedia, and the brand homepage. While Hypothesis 2 stated that select-service would not have a significantly different star-ratings than their full-service counterpart, this study found that both the HP and HIE had higher user-generated star-ratings than DT and HI. Hypothesis 3 stated that because of the blurring of the hotel segments, the antecedents of usergenerated star-ratings on online review websites would not be significantly different. This was mostly supported with the notable exception of brand. The examination of a brand name and its influence on star-ratings was unique to this study. This study drew from the work of Hammond et al. (1996) , which examined the relationship between brand and segmentation. They found that customers of the same product type do not differ by brand, therefore the mention of the brand would be expected to be similar for HI and DT and HIE and HP. In this study, the reviewers coded the review with 1 if there was a mention of the brand, parent brand, or rewards program separate from the hotel (i.e. not a mention for the DT Austin). For the HIE, brand was not significant either in a positive or negative mention. For HI and DT, the full-service brands, negative mentions of brand were significant in a negative direction. This means that a negative perception of brand had a negative influence on the overall star-ratings. For HP, brand was statistically significant for both positive and negative mentions. Positive perceptions of the brand had a significant effect on the star-ratings while negative perceptions of the brand had a negative influence on the star-ratings. However, it is notable that the negative brand mentions for HP were mentions of the loyalty program or the parent brand (Hilton Honors and Hilton Hotels) and not negative mentions of HP's brand. These results echo prior research into online reviews that found that brand image had a moderating impact on the impact of star-ratings on booking intentions (El-Said 2020).",

These results support previous research related to brand extensions in that the brand extension can change consumer expectations for the parent brand (Martinez and De Chernatony 2004) . However, the discussion of brand between DT and HP do not compare either brand to each other or to other specific brands but rather the specific brand experience for that brand.

Researchers are encouraged to conduct an examination of full-service and select-service hotels in international markets to determine if these findings are applicable in other geographic areas. Additionally, a cross-cultural study examining brand image in different cultures would be warranted to help lodging companies make decisions about their brand profiles. Hospitality researchers have found that creating local differences for international brands can increase customers' satisfaction (Jeong et al. 2019) ; future research into the difference between local innovation in full-service and select-service hotels and their impact on customer satisfaction would also further the work in segmentation theory. A topic of interest could be comparing different brands in the same brand family and same market segment but with different brand images, such as Town Place Suites by Marriott and Springhill Suites by Marriott. Additionally, future studies can also examine the impact of brand on customer experience and the impact of brand on price across different segments.",
