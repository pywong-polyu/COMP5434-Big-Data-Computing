Although the median age of reported cases in Germany was 49 years, people who died of COVID-19 were on average 82 years of age. 86% of the deceased were 70 years of age or older [1] . Secondly, a disproportionate burden on intensive care capacities became apparent. However, in contrast to many other countries, intensive care capacities were never exhausted in Germany [2] . High mortality rates reported from the neighbouring countries were partly due to the depletion of hospital resources [3] . A comparison between COVID-19 in spring 2020 and waves of influenza during the past five years in Germany showed higher rates of mechanical ventilation and mortality in a comparable age group for COVID-19 (age median ventilation: 71 years, age median intensive care treatment: 72 years). Also, compared to severe flu cases, the duration of mechanical ventilation in patients with COVID-19 was significantly longer [4] . The protection of older people has several objectives: individual protection against severe disease progression, preserving functional status and independence as well as the preservation of intensive care capacity in a community.",

However, more than 80% of the patients had a moderate course without hospitalization [5] . Individual risk and long-term functional outcome are of special interest in the vulnerable group of older patients. Large Chinese [6] and British [7] cohort studies of hospitalized COVID-19-patients examined age, comorbidities, and their influence on mortality without addressing functional outcome of survivors. The characteristics of the health systems and age structure of these populations show significant differences compared to Germany. For example, per capita spending on health care in Germany is almost ten times higher than in China when adjusted for purchasing power [8] . Especially in older subjects, reconvalescence from severe disease differs from younger patients. Patients transferred to nursing homes might not be eligible to now ongoing longterm follow-up studies.",

The total incidence of the district in this time frame was lower (0.5%) [1] . However, the comprehensive screening of all residents of nursing homes and assisted living facilities in the district revealed a point prevalence of 4.6% in April 2020, which was driven by local outbreaks in 4 of 27 facilities. 21 (39%) of all nursing home residents who contracted SARS-CoV-2 had no typical COVID-19 symptoms. These findings are in line with previous US and UK studies that reported a high rate (20 to 30%) of asymptomatic residents of nursing homes in comparable screening examinations [11, 12] . However, these studies only assessed typical symptoms of COVID-19 (acute respiratory symptoms, loss of sense of smell or taste) and did not include gastrointestinal symptoms, which were reported in 36% of the patients in our study. As shown in a recently published study, symptoms of COVID-19 differ in older and younger individuals [13] . Flu-like symptoms including fever, smell or taste disorders, cough, myalgia, headache, and gastrointestinal symptoms occur more frequently in older people than in younger persons [13] . Therefore, especially in older people, COVID-19 should be considered if gastrointestinal symptoms occur. Nevertheless, asymptomatic patients contribute to an underestimation of the numbers of cases. The survival rate in our study population (82%) is in line with the overall survival rate in Germany in the corresponding age cohort during the same period [14] . Regardless of the type of treatment, 86% of the previously self-sufficient patients and 75% of people with pre-infection care needs survived COVID-19. The need for care was the most important predictor of mortality in this full survey. These results are in accordance with several recent studies that identified frailty as an important prognostic factor in COVID-19 [15] [16] [17] . Due to the lack of a standardized assessment (e.g., Clinical Frailty Scale), we could not determine the degree of frailty in this retrospective report. An increased need for care may be used to approximate frailty [18] , but to identify the exact influence it has on mortality, a control group or stratified excess mortality would have been necessary.",

Although no statistically significant association with increased mortality was found for multimorbidity and arterial hypertension in our cohort, a clear trend was evident. Nevertheless, a recently published Spanish study in 834 people aged 60 years and older also showed an association only with heart failure, but not with arterial hypertension, malignancies, or diabetes mellitus [20] .

One explanation could be that patients with dementia may not understand the necessity for hygienic measures and suffer more from contact restrictions [22] , leading to challenges in their care. 73% of the surviving patients who previously lived independently at their private home were able to return there. Due to the relatively small number of patients, there was no statistical significance, but a clear trend for separate age groups: The proportion of patients returning to their private home after the disease was higher in the group of 70 to 80-year-old patients (83%) than in the group of patients aged 80 and older (62%).",

Increased care needs after hospitalization are an important and still underestimated complication of COVID-19, especially in previously healthy and self-sufficient older people. The long-term impact on care needs after surviving the disease should be analysed in larger cohorts and more extended follow-up periods. In particular, the rehabilitation potential should be fully utilized, particularly in older patients. This study underlines the need for representative, differentiated data on elderly patients. Age alone is not a sufficient criterion for the inclusion or exclusion from clinical trials especially in the context of COVID19. Nevertheless, a recently published study showed that older patients are underrepresented in current clinical trials of therapeutics and vaccinations against SARS-CoV-2 [23] . Furthermore, limiting clinical endpoints of interventional studies to mortality might underestimate their effects on patients of higher age. Limiting political and social debate on pure mortality underestimates the impact of the pandemic on society, capacities of nursing homes and caregivers.",

There is no detailed information on the functional status before infection, which was assessed by the premorbid care needs. The cause of death was available for patients treated in the hospital and could therefore be assigned to COVID-19. In outpatients, a causal connection could not be established due to missing clinical data. Since the official definition of Germany's health authorities only included \"acute respiratory symptoms of any severity\" as typical COVID symptoms during the largest period of the survey, taste and smell disturbances as well as gastrointestinal symptoms were not recorded in outpatients. This could lead to a bias regarding asymptomatic cases among outpatients. For outpatients, data on rejection of intensive therapy are lacking. This could lead to a confounding of mortality data among outpatients, especially if they are multimorbid and have dementia. Furthermore, our study cohort was small and localized. Thus, the generalizability of our findings has several limitations. In particular, the comparison to other countries is restricted by demographic differences as well as differences in the care and the country-specific existing care options for older people (such as nursing homes, assisted living, outpatient care services, etc.). Especially during the first wave, PCR-testing capacities were limited, so comparison of outpatient data between different nations is biased by underestimation of community-based events. However, increased post-COVID care needs due to decreased functional status after COVID-19 is a problem that not only affects Germany, but should be given attention worldwide.",
