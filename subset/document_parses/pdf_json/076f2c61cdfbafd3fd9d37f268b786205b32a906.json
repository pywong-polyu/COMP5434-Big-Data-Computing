These platforms facilitate trial efficiency integration including electronic consent, randomization, collection of patient/family survey data, delivery of an intervention, and basic data analysis. Methods: We created an online digital platform for a multicenter study that delivered an intervention for sleep disorders to parents of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). An advisory parent group provided input. Participants were randomized to receive either a sleep education pamphlet only or the sleep education pamphlet plus three quick-tips sheets and two videos that reinforced the material in the pamphlet (multimedia materials). Three measures -Family Inventory of Sleep Habits (FISH), Children's Sleep Habits Questionnaire modified for ASD (CSHQ-ASD), and Parenting Sense of Competence (PSOC)were completed before and after 12 weeks of sleep education. Results: Enrollment exceeded recruitment goals. Trial efficiency was improved, especially in data entry and automatic notification of participants related to survey completion. Most families commented favorably on the study. While study measures did not improve with treatment in either group (pamphlet or multimedia materials), parents reporting an improvement of \u22653 points in the FISH score showed a significantly improved change in the total CSHQ (P = 0.038). Conclusion: Our study demonstrates the feasibility of using online research delivery platforms to support studies in ASD, and more broadly, pediatric clinical and translational research. Online platforms may increase participant inclusion in enrollment and increase convenience and safety for participants and study personnel.",

In contrast to conventional, in-person methods, online research allows for the collection of data remotely, thereby allowing researchers to take new approaches to their work. A basic example of online research involves emailing a survey. However, online research has applications that go beyond survey collection. An online platform that is well developed and specifically dedicated to clinical and translational research can facilitate the integration of multiple research functions, including recruitment and consent, collection of patient/family survey data, delivery of information, including interventions, and basic data analysis resulting in increased trial efficiency. In addition to these substantial operational advantages for researchers, an online platform can facilitate participant recruitment through increased convenience and safety for participants and staff, improve participant inclusion and enrollment/retention, and contribute to an effective recruitment strategy and outreach. Several trial enhancement options and potential barriers to conduct research studies on digital platforms are listed in Table 1 , and we address these further below.",

Remote participation also poses less risk and anxiety to research participants and families in terms of contracting or spreading infectious disease, especially during a pandemic (e.g., [5] , and in fact, may be the only permissible option for conducting a research study that minimizes face-to-face contact with participants in such a situation.

Because study coordinators can carry out their work without dedicated clinical space for receiving participants, research conducted using online platforms can greatly increase the capacity to conduct larger studies with less personnel and physical facility requirements than traditional face-to-face research study methodology [2-4, 6, 7] . In models where the patient or family enters data directly into an electronic data capture system, coordinators are relieved of scheduling and data entry tasks that normally require significant dedicated effort [3, 8] , with reduced opportunity for error. Efficiency gains in communication between Principal Investigators (PIs) can also be achieved by reporting tools based on up-to-date data related to recruitment and study activities [3] . Modifications in digital platforms can be rolled out immediately to all participants and all study sites, thus greatly reducing the time and expense of logistical planning for non-digital material distribution [9] .",

To facilitate maximal inclusion of participants, it is important to optimize in-platform system design so that the expectations for the tasks participants need to complete are clear and concise. Additionally, participation in a study relying on a digital platform may be limited by digital access (devices, Internet) or technical proficiency. Recent reports show that 81% of US adults now own a smartphone, 74% a desktop computer, and 52% a tablet [10] . Notably, smartphone ownership is nearly as high among Black and Hispanic populations as Whites (80% and 79% vs. 82%) and reaches 71% of those with income under $30,000 [10] . Home Internet access has reached the saturation point (99%) [11] . While just 73% say they use broadband [12] , close to half (45%) of individuals without home broadband say their smartphone connection fills that void [13] . Hardware considerations may require budgeting for loaner devices so that those few participants without access to computers or smartphones can still complete the study, thereby improving study participation and generalizability. While this may incur a cost, the return of value in terms of incentivizing recruitment may be worthwhile [14] .",

While in-person experiences may allow participants to feel more fully connected [8] , a \"patient-centered\" approach that includes involving the patient or family directly in research functions and obtaining their feedback may enrich engagement and connectedness. Maintaining direct contact between the patient/ family and coordinators or clinicians with whom they have an established trust relationship, from the time of phone screening to study completion, can be helpful. Additional engagement and retention strategies include periodic phone calls, electronic messaging, dissemination of study news, and personalized thank you cards sent by mail. As study personnel are not engaging with participants face to face, a patient-centered approach is critical (involving study population in research design, continuously engaging participants to ensure full study participation through email reminders and phone calls). Because staff may not be immediately available, and a participant may be engaging with the digital platform, instructions for participants must be very concise and clear. Digital inequity might not allow everyone to participate. Participants may need to be loaned electronic devices to fully participate in study.",

While there is evidence that public trust in data privacy has become precarious due to several high-profile data breaches and dishonorable data-sharing practices in the online environment, research teams can take proactive steps to clearly articulate, in lay language, the controls, and measures in place to protect inappropriate access to research data [3] .

Importantly, research that includes children requires the involvement of legal guardians (e.g., families) to facilitate the consent/assent process [17, 18] . Regardless of the workflow and technical platform, established principles of consenting must be upheld [19] . Different US states and local Institutional review boards have unique requirements for the systems that are used to implement electronic signatures. Therefore, not all states can utilize the eConsent Framework, and sites within those states may need to use paper consents. Additionally, even if a state can use eConsent, a site may wish to consider making paper consent documents available to meet the needs of participants who prefer paper documents.",

Sleep education, including attention to daytime habits, evening routines, the timing of sleep, and parent interactions with their children, has shown benefit in improving sleep, child behavior, and family functioning [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] , and practice guidelines have emphasized its use as the first-line treatment [29, 30] . Delivery of sleep education to reach as many families as possible (including those without easy access to practitioners) can be facilitated through apps and other online methods [31] . Our approach included utilization and extension of an existing, well-supported Research Electronic Data Capture tool (REDCap) [32, 33] online platform, which is freely available to academic, nonprofit, and government organizations around the globe and is now supporting more than 1.3M end users across over 4000 institutions in 137 countries.

While others have previously reported on online education for children with ASD and sleep problems [41] , and found comparable results to face-to-face education, comparisons of two online approaches (pamphlet alone Table 2 . Change in CSHQ-ASD total score from baseline to week 12, combining participants from the pamphlet and multimedia groups. and multimedia materials) to sleep education have not been previously reported to our knowledge. Furthermore, our work illustrates how a research study can be conducted largely online. The use of online software specifically designed for capturing research data and incorporating related research requirements can be instrumental to a study's success. With the REDCap platform, we were able to conduct remote consent (at one site), deliver the study's educational intervention, collect survey data, message participants, and track responses, with all these elements folded into a customized Parent Portal dashboard that was designed to sit atop an already established platform -REDCap. Because many REDCap features are \"plug and play,\" software development expenses were minimized, enabling the use of budgeted funds for customization. REDCap is free to research institutions and offers substantial online training and support to investigators in the use of many elements and features, all of which are highly customizable. Therefore, most of the elements used in this study are available to REDCap users at present. We did not find that having access to multimedia materials improved sleep when compared to a pamphlet alone. While we saw improvements in sleep habits, sleep patterns, and PSOC after parents received access to the online educational intervention, these improvements were not statistically significant. This may have been due to a variety of factors, including a relatively small sample size coupled with heterogeneity in our study sample (some parents needed more support than an online set of materials could provide). It is important to note that a sizable proportion of parents did not choose to view the online materials. We did find that sleep patterns, as measured by the CSHQ-ASD, improved significantly more in families that had a 3 or more point improvement in FISH score, supporting that improvements in sleep habits are associated with improvements in sleep patterns.",

Another advantage was that the study was able to continue during COVID-19, at a time when many other clinical research studies needed to pause in-person visits due to the risks of participants contracting or spreading infection. Enrollment exceeded goals. Survey completion (retention) rates were fair. At two sites, phone calls were made to participants who did not respond to email messages regarding overdue surveys. At one site, participants received a completion certificate. We may have improved retention by making phone calls and providing completion certificates to all participants.",

While given access at end of study to all materials, they may have misunderstood that they would have access earlier on in the study. Clearer communication in the consenting process with reinforcement by study coordinators may have been helpful for clarification. Another study limitation is that we did not know how often families viewed materials (families could view printed materials at a later date) so we were not able to precisely measure the \"dose\" of the intervention. One way to get around this limitation would be to ask families to log the number of times they viewed materials, although this would create an additional family burden.",
