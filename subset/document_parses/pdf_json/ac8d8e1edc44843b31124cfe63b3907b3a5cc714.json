            "text": "We previously reported that lip inoculation of Herpes simplex virus type I (HSV I) in specific strains of mice would induce multifocal brain demyelination (MBD). The mechanisms mediating the development of MBD are unknown. In this study, five inbred strains of mice (C57BL/6J, Balb/cByJ, A/J, SJL/J, PL/J) immunosuppressed with either irradiation (IR), cyclophosphamide (CY), or cyclosporin A (CP) along with three immune deficient strains (C57BL/6J nu/nu, Balb/cByJ nu/nu, C57BL/6J bg/bg) were lip inoculated with HSV I to determine the effect of immunosuppression on viral spread throughout the brain and the development of demyelination during the acute stage of infection. Mortality increased in all groups when compared with controls but was greatest in A/J, SJL/J, and PL/J strains, where all mice died before day 6 PI. In contrast with immunocompetent C57BL/6J mice where virus is restricted to the brainstem, virus spread throughout the brain of immunosuppressed C57BL/6J, C57BL/6J nu/nu, and C57BL/6J bg/bg mice. Despite viral spread throughout the brain of immunosuppressed C57BL/6J, C57BL/6J nu/nu, Balb/cByJ and Balb/cByJ nu/nu mice, MBD did not develop. MBD did develop however, in both HSV I infected C57BL/6J bg/bg and CP treated Balb/cByJ mice. Immunosuppression of HSV I infected Balb/cByJ mice prevents the development of demyelination at the trigeminal root entry zone (TREZ) of the brainstem while in Balb/cByJ nu/nu mice, the extent of demyelination at TREZ was reduced and delayed when compared with immunocompetent controls. These results suggest that the immune system plays an important role in limiting viral spread in the brain as well as in the development of demyelination at TREZ and of MBD throughout the brain during the acute phase of infection. Virus alone does not induce MBD in this animal model of virus induced CNS demyelination but is a prerequisite for its development.",

            "text": "Experimental animals infected with herpes simplex virus type I (HSV I) develop many features of herpetic infection observed in man including: acute disease (Kastrukoff et al., 1982) , latent infection of the peripheral nervous system (PNS) (Cook and Stevens 1973) , and viral nucleic acid sequences in the central nervous system (CNS) (Cabrera et al. 1980; Rock and Fraser 1983) . Of interest is the ability of HSV I to induce CNS demyelination in mice following peripheral inoculation with virus. The lesions, which are characterized by demyelination, relative preservation of axons, and a mononuclear cell (MNC) infiltrate, were originally identified in Balb/c mice and thought to be restricted to the trigeminal root entry zone (TREZ) of the brainstem (Kristensson et al. 1979; Townsend 1981) . Recent studies however, indicate that other murine strains (A/J, SJL/J, and PL/J) develop multifocal brain demyelination (MBD) following lip inoculation with HSV I (Kastrukoff et al. 1987 . Kastrukoff et al. 1992 ). All three murine strains develop acute stage MBD. This phase is characterized by the sequential appearance of lesions (TREZ > brainstem > cerebellum > cerebral hemispheres) beginning 6 days post-infection (PI) and ending by day 24 PI (Kastrukoff et al. 1992) . In addition, A/J and PL/J mice develop chronic stage MBD where new lesions appear sporadically throughout the brain for up to 8 weeks PI in the former and beyond 28 weeks PI in the latter strain (Kastrukoff et al. 1992) .",

MBD develops in two stages. In the acute stage, MBD develops sequentially throughout the brain while in the chronic stage it develops sporadically (Kastrukoff et al. 1992) . The mechanisms mediating the development of MBD remain unknown. The results of this study, using immunocompromised mice suggest: that the immune system plays a role in limiting viral spread in the brain following peripheral inoculation with virus, that the effectiveness of the immune system in limiting viral spread in the brain depends on the murine strain, and that other mechanisms may play a role in limiting viral production in the brain. The results suggest that the immune system plays a role in the development of demyelination at the trigeminal root entry zone (TREZ) and MBD developing during the acute stage. Also, viral spread throughout the brain is a requirement for the development of demyelination.",

Furthermore, the higher viral titers in the brains of immunocompromised mice compared with immunocompetent controls (Kastrukoff et al. 1987) suggests that the immune system plays a role in clearing virus from the brain. Differences in both mortality and viral titers in the brain do occur among the different immunocompromised murine strains. One possible explanation for these differences is that C57BL/6J and Balb/cByJ mice were only partially immunosuppressed. This is unlikely as the methods employed in the protocol were designed to induce complete immunosuppression (Worthington et al. 1980 ) and this is reflected in the low levels of anti-HSV antibody in all strains. It is more likely that other mechanisms besides the immune system play a role. Differences in resistance to HSV I have been identified in primary glial cultures derived from different murine strains (Kastrukoff et al., 1987; Thomas et al. 1991 ) and may play a role in limiting viral production and spread in the brain.",

Additional studies are required to confirm the importance of NK cells as other immune abnormalities do occur in bg/bg mice, to determine which subsets of T-cells play a role, and to determine the site of action of the immune cells in limiting the spread of virus in the CNS.

In contrast, C57BL/6J mice does not develop MBD after CP, but virus does not spread throughout the brain. These results indicate that under certain circumstances, Balb/cByJ mice can develop MBD. The mechanisms involved in the production of demyelination in this case are not clear. As an immunosuppressant, CP has many actions (Hess et al. 1982) including inhibition of helper T-cell function (Kahan 1989) , inhibition of selected cytotoxic T-cell function (Orosz et al. 1988) , and sparing of suppresser T-cell function. None of these actions easily explain why MBD develops in CP treated Balb/cByJ mice. CP also has a number of non-immunosuppressant actions including the ability to inhibit direct cell to cell transmission of HSV I (McKenzie et al. 1987) . One might speculate that in Balb/cByJ mice, CP inhibits the transneuronal spread of HSV I known to occur in the CNS (Ugolini et al. 1989; Margolis et al. 1989 ) and result in increased viral escape at the synapses. Virus, contained by surrounding glial cells similar to that seen with pseudorabies infection of the CNS (L.W. Enquist, personal communication), could become the target of the immune system resulting in demyelination.",

            "text": "A murine model of HSV I induced CNS demyelination is only one of a number of different experimental models of virus induced demyelination which have implications for human demyelinating disease. These models have recently been reviewed in detail (Dal Canto 1990; Rice and Kastrukoff 1993) . Although specific details of the pathology and pathogenesis vary from one model system to another, similarities do exist. These include: the ability of a number of different viruses and specific viral strains to induce CNS demyelination, susceptibility of specific strains of animals to develop demyelination, an acute stage of infection followed by the development of chronic demyelination, a persistent or latent viral infection, and in some cases a role for the immune system in the development of demyelination. Unlike HSV I, the initial demyelinating lesions observed with canine distemper virus are not necessarily associated with inflammatory infiltrates. This observation suggested that different mechanisms were operating during the acute and persistent stages of infection. Further observations suggested that the demyelination developing during the acute stage was dependent on astrocytic infection. In contrast, the development of the persistent stage of infection appeared to depend on the effectiveness of antibody-mediated clearance of virus during the acute stage of infection. Similarly, the initial demyelinating lesions seen with coronaviruses (e.g. JHM strain of murine hepatitis virus) preceded the development of an inflammatory infiltrate. This observation along with failure of immuno-suppression to prevent demyelination (Weiner 1973) suggested that demyelination developing during the acute stage was produced by direct viral cytopathic effect on the myelinating cells. In contrast, the development of demyelination during the chronic stage appears to result from an interplay between persistent virus and the immune system. Visna virus can also induce acute and chronic stage CNS demyelination but unlike canine distemper virus and JHM virus, the demyelinating lesions developing during the acute stage appear to be immune mediated as immunosuppression with CY and anti-thymocyte serum prevents their development (Nathanson et al. 1976) . It is unclear if the demyelinating lesions developing during the chronic stage are also immune mediated. Similarly in Theiler's murine ecephalomyelitis virus induced demyelination, the acute stage of demyelination appears to be immune mediated. Immunosuppression with CY and antithymocyte serum prevents the development of inflammation and demyelination (Lipton and Dal Canto 1976) . The development of demyelination during the chronic stage appears to result from an interplay between persistent virus and the immune system.",
