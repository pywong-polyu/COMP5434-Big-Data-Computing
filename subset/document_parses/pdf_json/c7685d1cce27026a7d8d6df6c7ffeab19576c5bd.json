Traditionally, HRCT is used in patients with torpid clinical evolution, comorbidities, or suspected complications such as empyema, ARDS, and lung abscess. Recent studies suggest that HRCT can play a major role in patients with suspected pneumonia. Nie et al. in their work with 178 patients with communityacquired pneumonia (CAP) concluded that the effect of the treatment based on HRCT findings is not inferior to the effect of the treatment guided by microbiological characterization [4] . A series by Karhu et al. (65 patients with severe community-acquired pneumonia) discovered new HRCT findings compared to those seen on the X-rays in 60% of the patients, which generated an additional treatment conduct in 75% of the cases [5] . The retrospective nature of the trials and the scarce number of patients, currently, do not allow recommending substantial changes on the use of HRCT in patients with pneumonia. However, there is no doubt that new multidetector helical tomography techniques, with drastic reduction of ionizing radiation for the patient, can offer safe and relevant information in patients with pneumonia. Therefore, further studies are required to redefine the usefulness of HRCT for the diagnosis and follow-up of patients with suspected pneumonia.",

In a multicenter study of intrapleural sepsis, the most common germs associated to pleural infection were Streptococcus intermedius (24%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (21%), and other Streptococci (7%), followed by anaerobic bacteria (20%) and staphylococci (10%). The most common pathogens in hospital-acquired infections were staphylococci (35%) and gram-negative bacteria (23%) [20] . Ultrasound studies allow characterization of the pleural liquid and defining the presence of particles or septa and associated pleural thickening. CT allows defining the precise distribution of pleural collections, the presence of pleural thickening (with or without lung entrapment), and characterizing associated parenchymal alterations (Fig. 5.11 ).",

The incidence of ARDS in patients with sepsis is 6% to 7% in Western Hemisphere countries. ARDS may be either primary or pulmonary (related to pneumonia /aspiration) or secondary or extrapulmonary (trauma, nonpulmonary sepsis, pancreatitis, etc.) [22] . Radiographic manifestations depend on the evolution of the ARDS and the degree of the lung's fibroproliferative response. During the early phases, imaging studies show ground-glass opacities and/or consolidation of variable distribution (patchy, AP attenuation gradient, or diffuse distribution). In patients with significant fibroproliferative changes, HRCT findings include ground-glass opacities, intralobular densities, distorted lung architecture, traction bronchiectasis, and honeycombing pattern. In a recent cohort of patients with ARDS, decreased respiratory compliance was associated to increased reticulation and traction bronchiectasis in an a b c Fig. 5.11 (a-c) Chest X-ray and CT (axial and coronal) of a 56-year-old man with bacterial pneumonia and empyema show right pleural collection with air and pleural thickening HRCT performed 14 days after the ARDS diagnosis.
