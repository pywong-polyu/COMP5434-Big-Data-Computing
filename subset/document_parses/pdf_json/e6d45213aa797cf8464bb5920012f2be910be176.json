Studies among subpopulations have often found little or no evidence of racial/ethnic disparities in case fatality. Using data from the Michigan Disease Surveillance System (MDSS) from March 8 through July 5, 2020, Zelner et al. found that Blacks had substantially higher rates of COVID-19 infection and mortality. However, the case fatality rate among Blacks was only modestly higher than that of Whites, suggesting that differences in COVID-19 mortality were driven by differences in the rate of infection. 4 Similarly, among individuals receiving care in the US Department of Veterans Affairs tested for COVID-19 between February 8 and July 22, 2020, Rentsch et al. found that while Blacks and Hispanics were more likely to test positive than Whites, once infected their 30day mortality was less and, after adjusting for age, sex and rural/urban residence, was equivalent to that of Whites. 5 Several studies have examined racial/ethnic differences in hospitalization and/or case fatality rates among health care systems, where access to electronic health records permits adjusting for demographic and clinical covariates. Azar et al. examined COVID-19 positive patients within Sutter Health in northern California from January 1 through April 8, 2020, and found that African Americans had 2.7 times the odds of hospitalization compared to Whites despite adjusting for age, sex, comorbidities and income. 6 Similarly, Price-Haywood et al. studied COVID-19 positive patients within Ochsner Health in Louisiana and found that although Blacks had roughly twice the odds of hospitalization than Whites, their risk of in-hospital death was similar. 7 Adjusting for demographics, income, comorbidities and clinical characteristics upon admission had only a modest impact on the estimated difference in mortality. Finally, Ogedegbe et al. examined patients within New York University's Langone Health system who were tested for COVID-19 between March 1 and April 8, 2020. 8 In contrast to the previous two studies, the odds of hospitalization among those who tested positive were similar among Blacks, Hispanics and Whites. However, among those hospitalized, Black and Hispanic patients were less likely than White patients to die despite adjusting for demographic characteristics, comorbidities and insurance.",

For example, it is possible that a tendency among Blacks/African Americans to seek care later in the acute setting-perhaps due to structural inequities, biases on the part of providers and prior negative experiences with health care-may partly account for the higher rates of admission observed in some studies. 6, 10 If true, focusing on in-hospital mortality could reduce the apparent difference in case fatality between Blacks and Whites due to a larger proportion of Black individuals with COVID-19 being hospitalized. More generally, while studies of selected subgroups can benefit from higher quality data and can answer questions of local interest, it remains important to study COVID-19 risk and severity at the population level.",

We performed a parallel analysis using the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) COVID-19 Case Surveillance Public Use data-an independently compiled and regularly updated individual-level data source. Although less complete than the CTP data, the CDC data contain information on age. Adjusting for age is critical to get an accurate understanding of differences in COVID-19 CFR. 11 We focused on the two largest minority groups, Blacks/African Americans and Latinx, and their comparison to Whites, since these categories are reported most completely by a large number of states and territories, and permit approximate comparability between the two datasets.",

While some deaths reported in a month corresponded to cases reported from previous months, sensitivity analyses including cases from the 2-3 previous months yielded similar results. Monthly rates for the CDC data were computed as the proportion of cases reported in that month that resulted in death; this is therefore a leading indicator since some of those deaths occurred in subsequent months. The following states or territories were excluded from all analyses of the CDC data: nine states (AK, DE, HI, MO, NE, SD, TX, VI, WV) reported no deaths, with survival status missing for all or nearly all cases; three states reported only deaths (WA), nearly all deaths (IL) or half as many deaths as cases (RI), also with survival status missing for a large fraction of cases; and one state (GA) and Puerto Rico were outliers in a log-log plot of deaths versus all cases (including those with missing survival status). These exclusions reduced our analyses of CDC data to 38 states.

Moreover, some individuals who tested positive may not appear in the datasets used here. Thus, we expect that much of the change over time, as well as of the substantial variation across states, reflects variation in the rates of testing and reporting. Several studies have found higher testing rates among Blacks and Hispanics than among Whites, including a study of roughly 50 million patients in the Epic health record system. 5,21-23 Higher testing rates among minorities would be expected ceteris paribus to reduce their CFR relative to Whites.
