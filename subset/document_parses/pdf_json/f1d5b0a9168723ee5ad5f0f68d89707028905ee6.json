            "text": "We present multi-epoch optical and near-infrared observations of the highly reddened, Fe class slow nova V2891 Cygni. The observations span 15 months since its discovery. The initial rapid brightening from quiescence, and the presence of a \u223c35 day long pre-maximum halt, is well documented. The evidence that the current outburst of V2891 Cyg has undergone several distinct episodes of mass ejection is seen through time-varying P Cygni profiles of the O 7773 \u00c5 line. A highlight is the occurrence of a dust formation event centred around \u223c+273d, which coincides with a phase of coronal line emission. The dust mass is found to be \u223c 0.83 \u2212 1.25 \u00d7 10 \u221210 . There is strong evidence to suggest that the coronal lines are created by shock heating rather than by photoionization. The simultaneous occurrence of the dust and coronal lines (with varying velocity shifts) supports the possibility that dust formation is shock-induced. Such a route for dust formation has not previously been seen in a nova, although the mechanism has been proposed for dust formation in some core-collapse supernovae. Analysis of the coronal lines indicates a gas mass and temperature of 8.35-8.42\u00d710 \u22127 M and \u223c (4.8 \u2212 9.1) \u00d7 10 5 K respectively, and an overabundance of aluminium and silicon. A Case B analysis of the hydrogen lines yields a mass of the ionized gas of (8.60 \u00b1 1.73) \u00d7 10 \u22125 M . The reddening and distance to the nova are estimated to be ( \u2212 ) = 2.21\u00b10.15 and = 5.50 kpc respectively.",

            "text": "Nova V2891 Cygni (also known as AT 2019qwf, PGIR 19brv and ZTF19abyukuy) was discovered at a band magnitude of 11.3\u00b10.02 on 2019 September 17.25 UT by De et al. (2019) during regular survey operations of the Palomar Gattini-IR telescope. The source was not detected to a five sigma limit of = 13.8 mag on 2019 Sep 14.27 UT, implying a rise of at least \u0394 \u2265 2.5 mag in \u22643.0 days. It Spectroscopy by Lee et al. (2019) on 2019 Sep 21(+7d) showed emission lines of H having a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 820 kms \u22121 , H , O (at 7774, 8446, and 9266 \u00c5) , several Paschen lines between 8500 and 10050 \u00c5; the magnitude was measured to be 15.1 mag. Optical spectra, recorded by Srivastava et al. (2019) on 2019 November 01.71 UT (+48d), showed a significant narrowing of the H emission (FWHM\u223c300 kms \u22121 ) compared to the preceding reports. In addition, the O 7773 \u00c5 line showed a P Cygni profile, even \u223c48 days after the outburst. The prolonged mass-loss suggested that this would be a slow nova. A Fe classification of the nova was later made by Munari (2019) with optical spectrum recorded on 2019 November 5.94 UT(+52d). The Fe classification was confirmed with near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy on 2019 November 17.85 UT(+64d). Based on the presence of lowexcitation Na and Mg lines in the NIR spectrum, it was predicted that the nova is likely to form dust (Das et al. 2008) , which did transpire though late in the nova's evolution.",

            "text": "Subsequent evolution of the light curve showed that V2891 Cyg was indeed a slow nova whose brightness fluctuated around maximum for a considerable time (section 3.1), followed by a slow decline. During this extended phase around maximum, while the photometric variations were minimal, substantial spectroscopic changes apparent in regular (mostly optical) spectroscopic monitoring. These changes encompassed variations in the FWHMs and equivalent widths of the emission lines, changes and later disappearance of P Cygni profiles, the appearance of time-varying structures in the line profiles, and the emergence of forbidden lines of [O ] etc. . The nova was also followed at other wavelengths, and spectral changes were reported, e.g. optically thick free-free emission from the expanding nova ejecta (Sokolovsky et al. 2020 ), fading of carbon lines (a hallmark of the Fe class of novae), and the emergence of NIR coronal lines (De & Palomar Gattini-IR Collaboration 2020; Woodward et al. 2020a) etc. In this work, we present optical and NIR observations of V2891 Cyg, carried out between 2019 November 1 (+48d) to 2020 December 12 (+455d). These observations comprise optical photometry and spectroscopy from the 1.2m Mt. Abu Telescope (India), the Asiago 1.22m and 1.82m telescopes (Italy), the ID0310 telescope from the ANS (Asiago Novae and Symbiotic stars) collaboration , and NIR spectroscopy from Mt.Abu 1.2m telescope, the 3.6m ARIES-DOT telescope (India), and the 3.2m NASA-IRTF facility.",

The instrument provides seeing-limited imaging in the Bessell filters over a 5.2 \u00d7 5.2 arc-minute 2 field of view, with a sampling of 3.3 pixels per arc-second. MFOSC-P is equipped with three plane reflection gratings that yield resolutions of = \u0394 / = 2000, 1000 and 500 (referred to as the R2000, R1000, and R500 modes hereafter). The standard spectral coverage of these modes are \u223c6000-7000\u00c5, \u223c4700-6650\u00c5, and \u223c4500-8500\u00c5 respectively. In the R500 mode, the spectral region beyond 7400\u00c5 is covered by rotating the grating while simultaneously using a Bessel-blocking filter to avoid second-order contamination. The response corrected spectra for both settings of the grating were co-joined together around 7200\u00c5, after flux matching in the common overlap region, to obtain a complete spectrum free from second-order contamination. The spectroscopic observations presented here were made with a 75 m slit width (equivalent to 1.0 on the sky). Wavelength calibration was done using Xenon and Neon calibration lamps. For the purpose of instrument response correction, spectrophotometric standard stars from the ESO catalogue 2 were observed, with settings identical to those for the nova observations.",

The LC of nova V 2891 Cyg shows a slow rise of duration \u223c 120 days, including several episodes of re-brightening with magnitude\u223c1.2, before it begins its decline. There is also a reasonably \"flat\" phase, of duration \u223c180 days, between 30-210 days after outburst, during which the nova stays at a mean value of \u223c 16 mag, accompanied by modulations with amplitude ranging up to \u00b11.2 mags. Defining a 2 (the time interval in days for the LC to decline 2 magnitudes from the peak) for an LC of this nature is difficult, so the band data were smoothed with 5 point running averages to annul the smaller amplitude jitters (Munari et al. (2017) and references therein). From the resultant smoothed curves, we find that, if the first peak is considered as the principal maximum, then t 2 is \u223c 150 days. If the second peak is taken as the maximum, then t 2 \u223c 100 days. A similar estimate of t 2 (JD 2458740.660) , is taken as time of outburst. All spectra were recorded and photometry was done using MFOSC-P instrument. b: Spectrophotometric standard stars were observed on the same, or on contemporaneous, nights. is also obtained from ZTF band light curve. For our analysis, an exact value of 2 is not essential. It is sufficient to note that 2 is large, and a range of 100 to 150 days may be considered appropriate -we will use this approximation in the distance estimation that follows. Similarly, 3 (the time interval in days for the LC to decline 3 mags from the peak) is constrained to be in the range 180-230 days. Again, the exact value of 3 is not critical for any of the subsequent analyses.",

The MFOSC-P spectrum at = 2000, obtained on 2019 Nov 1 (+48d), gives a closely similar value. Averaging over the two independent estimates gives ( \u2212 ) = 2.20 \u00b1 0.03, or = 6.82 (for a value of the total-toselective extinction =3.1) which is the value we adopt for the rest of our analysis. It was not possible to use the O 0.8446 m and 1.2187 m line ratios to estimate the reddening because the spectra recording these lines (observed between 2020 May and September) are affected to varying degrees by nova dust, which clearly causes additional extinction.",

            "text": "Following Das et al. (2015) and Banerjee et al. (2018) , we also use an independent approach with the additional benefit that it allows the simultaneous estimates of the the extinction and distance, by using the distance-dependence of the extinction towards the nova, and the absolute magnitude derived from the Maximum Magnitude Rate of Decline (MMRD) relationship (Cohen 1985 , and references therein). The extinction towards the nova, over a 5 arc-minute field (Marshall et al. 2006) , is plotted in Fig. 3 for the two closest lines of sight available. We also plot the extinction versus distance as derived from the distance modulus equation using (max) = 14.05 from observations, and = (\u22126.86 to \u22126.91) \u00b1 0.20 from the MMRD relation of della Valle & Livio (1995); we use 2 = 100d to 150d as derived earlier. The intersection of this curve (solid black in Fig. 3 ) with the two extinction curves (dashed lines) allows us simultaneously to determine the distance and extinction for the nova. The two different intersections (for red and green lines) yield = 0.67 \u00b1 0.02 and = 0.61 \u00b1 0.02 respectively. The corresponding distances are = 4.90\u00b10.15 kpc, and = 6.45\u00b10.14 kpc respectively. The average values from this method are = 0.64 \u00b1 0.02 and = 5.68 \u00b1 0.78 kpc. A recent MMRD relation of Selvelli & Gilmozzi (2019) , based on revised distances from Gaia (Gaia Collaboration et al. 2016) , uses 3 values. For 3 in the range 180 to 230 days, we find = \u22126.30 \u00b1 0.56 to \u22126.07 \u00b1 0.58. Following the same method as above, this corresponds to an average = 0.59 \u00b1 0.05 and distance = 5.32 \u00b1 0.37 kpc. We choose the average of the values derived from these two MMRD relations for (= 0.61 \u00b1 0.04) and (= 5.50 \u00b1 0.86) kpc. This implies = A /0.089 = 6.85\u00b10.45 (or ( \u2212 ) = 2.21 \u00b1 0.15) which is a good match with the value = 6.82 derived above. We shall use these values for further analysis. The continuous black curve is a plot of extinction versus distance (kpc) from the equation \u2212 = 5 log \u2212 5 + , where is known from observations. and is estimated from the MMRD relation (della Valle & Livio 1995). A relation / = 0.089 is used for the necessary conversion (Glass 1999; Marshall et al. 2006) . The intersection of the two curves permits simultaneous estimation of the extinction and distance to the nova. See text for details. magnitudes (using ( \u2212 ) = 2.20), a blackbody fit (see Fig. 4 ) yields a temperature of = 6068\u00b198 K for the potential progenitor. The luminosity and radius of the donor star are determined to be 2.76 \u00b1 0.31 and 1.50 \u00b1 0.07 , respectively. Although these values may correspond to the spectral type of F9V for the potential progenitor, we also note that an overall temperature of 6000-7000 K is also suitable for an accretion disc. Pre-novae in quiescence can also be disc-dominated systems (Selvelli & Gilmozzi 2013) . Therefore, we are cautious about drawing any conclusion about the nature of the donor. Extrapolating this black-body curve gives an band magnitude of \u223c 22, which, when compared to the peak value of = 12.95 recorded by the ZTF, indicates an outburst amplitude A of approximately 10 magnitudes. This is consistent with the amplitude expected for a slow nova (see, e.g., the A versus 2 correlation plot in Warner 1995) . The close positional coincidence, the estimated A value and the spectral type of the UKIDSS/Pan-STARRS source are all consistent with that expected of a nova progenitor. An image of the earliest ZTF detection of the nova when it was still rising from quiescence to maximum is interesting to see; this is shown in Fig. 5 along with its image at maximum.",

The spectrum showed a steeply rising continuum towards longer wavelengths, signifying a large amount of reddening, which was also clear from the photometry.

We decomposed the Hprofiles of the high-resolution echelle spectra recorded on 2019 Nov 13(+60d), Dec 8(+85d), 9(+86d) and 14(+91d) for these superimposed absorption components, as shown in Fig. 10 in the velocity Table 5 . Details of the decomposed emission and absorption components of H-from the echelle spectra. The decomposed profiles are shown in Fig. 10 for emission (e1 and e2), pre-maximum (pm) and principal absorption (p1 and p2) components. Heliocentric velocity (HV), the velocity width at half maximum (VHM), equivalent width (EW), and integrated flux (reddening corrected) for emission (e1), pre-maximum (pm), principal (p), and one redshifted emission (e2) . The absorption and emission profiles were fitted with symmetric Gaussian functions. The derived heliocentric velocity (HV), velocity width at half maximum (VHM), equivalent width (EW) and integrated flux are given in Table 5 . The H-emission profile of 2019 Nov 13 (+60d) can be reconstructed with two additional absorption components at -194 and -305 kms \u22121 . We identify these as pre-maximum and principal components. The main emission component (e1) had a velocity width of 406 kms \u22121 . Another faint emission component (e2) is also seen on the red wing, at a velocity of +282 km \u22121 . Subsequent profiles can also be approximated by the same emissions (e1 and e2) and, together with pre-maximum and principal absorption components. On 2019 Dec 8 (+85d), the pre-maximum component was seen at -280 kms \u22121 , while the principal absorption system now had two components (p1 and p2), at -411 and -622 kms \u22121 . The profile of Dec 9 (+86d) is similar to that of Dec 8. In the decomposed profile on Dec 14 (+91d), the pre-maximum absorption is at -282kms \u22121 . The p2 component of the principal absorption is not seen, while the p1 component persists at -393kms \u22121 . The origin of absorption components in novae have been explored in recent studies (see, e.g., Williams et al. 2008; Williams & Mason 2010; Arai et al. 2016 , and references therein) in the context of Transient Heavy Element Absorption (THEA) systems, where the presence of \"principal\" and \"diffuse enhanced\" systems was seen as an indication of the presence of multiple envelopes/shells in the nova ejecta. In nova V2891 Cyg, these absorption components were of \u223c700 kms \u22121 between the ejecta and such absorption system, the distance of these systems from the central source is estimated as \u223c43 au. This is consistent with the projection of Williams et al. (2008) , who postulated that the disappearance is due to the collision between the two gaseous components. The emission component e1 shows the evolution of its heliocentric velocity, as well as a spread in its velocity profile (Table 5) , while the red-shifted e2 emission remains almost constant. The e2 component is weak in the spectrum of Nov 13 (+60d), but strengthens by Dec 8 (+85d). This could be due to a change in the optical depth of the gas between +60 and +85 days, so that receding material (positive velocity) -previously not visible -has now gained in strength. This e2 component again becomes weaker by Dec 14 (+91d). It is interesting to note that the flux of the e1 and e2 components dropped by factors of \u223c2.7 and \u223c2.2, respectively, in a 5-day interval (between +86d and +91d). Such speedy recombination rates point to very high electron densities. However, at the time of these H-observations, the light curve of the nova was undergoing the largest and and most rapid up-and-down changes, and the flux of the e1 component evolved in parallel with the band flux of the nova. Therefore, evidently, the nebular material responsible for the emission in the band was at high density, and capable of recombining in a matter of very few days and rapidly following the changing photo-ionising input from the central star. This behaviour is mirrored by that of the e1 H-component, being emitted by the same gas as that responsible for the continuum emission at optical wavelengths.",

Whereas its evolution between +84d to +91d corresponds to the optically thinning of the ejecta as a larger volume is now available for the emission profile. This could also explain why the fluxes (or equivalent widths) of both emission components e1 and e2 were not in synchronisation between +60d and +84d, whereas between +84d and +91d, e2 followed the behaviour of e1.",

            "text": "V2891 Cyg showed prominent oxygen lines at various stages of its evolution, from initial fireball to coronal phase, a period of 15 months. We determined the flux ratios of various optical and NIR lines (e.g., O 0.8446 m, 1.1287 m, and 1.3164 m), which suggested the action of Ly-fluorescence. The [O ] lines (5577, 6300, 6364 \u00c5) are used to determine the electron temperature of the neutral gas, and the mass M of the neutral O , following the prescription of Williams (1994) . These lines were detected in the spectra of 2019 Dec 7(+83d) and Dec 15(+92d). The mass of neutral oxygen is estimated to be \u223c 8.6[\u00b11.3] \u00d7 10 \u22126 M , which is consistent with the typical mass of oxygen in a nova eruption (\u223c 1.1 \u00d7 10 \u22124 \u2212 5.3 \u00d7 10 \u22128 M ; Williams 1994) . The corresponding electron temperature was determined to be \u223c5600 K. An interesting development was the variability in the line profile of the O 7773\u00c5 during its early evolution of during 2019 Nov-2020 Jan. The velocity profiles of O 7773\u00c5 are shown in Fig. 11 , from 2019 Nov to 2020 May. A P Cygni profile in the O 7773\u00c5 line was seen in our first optical spectrum, taken on 2019 Nov 1(+48d), and on the spectrum taken on 2019 Nov 12(+59d). It had disappeared by Nov 19(+66d). The absorption feature was at \u223c500 kms \u22121 on Nov 1(+48d), while on Nov 12(+59d), it was at \u223c300 kms \u22121 . The subsequent change in the O 7773\u00c5 line profile was found to be correlated with its re-brightening. It can be seen from the LC (Fig. 1) , and Tables 1, and 3, that the first instance of brightening had begun around 2019 Nov 25(+72d). The nova attained its first maximum on Nov 30(+77d) ( \u223c14.05), faded to a minimum on Dec 7(+84d), and brightened on Dec 17(+94d). Correspondingly, the O 7773\u00c5 profile of Nov 27(+74d) shows deep P Cygni absorption (absorption component at \u223c450 kms \u22121 ), which disappeared by Dec 13(+90d). The P Cygni feature in O 7773\u00c5 had again re-appeared in the spectra taken on Dec 15(+92d) and Dec 19(+96d) (absorption feature at \u223c700-750 kms \u22121 ). Another rebrightening occurred on 2020 Jan 12(+120d), whose imprint can be seen in the re-appearance of a deep P Cygni profile of the O 7773\u00c5 line on 2020 Jan 13(+121d), with absorption feature at \u223c600 kms \u22121 . It is of further interest to note that the H-profile of Jan 13(+121d) also shows the P Cygni feature. In both cases, the blue-shifted absorption occurred at a velocity of \u223c500-600km \u22121 , indicating that the blue absorptions in H-/O 7773\u00c5 are likely to be due to the outburst.",

(2011) have studied six slow/moderate fast novae, which showed re-brightening in the early phase after maximum. However, these novae showed a similar re-appearance of P Cygni profiles in multiple emission lines, e.g. H-, H-, He , Na , Fe , O etc. The typical blue-shifted velocity separation of absorption components was found to be in the range \u223c 750 \u2212 2500 km \u22121 . Several consistent reasons for re-brightening, and the re-appearance of P cygni features, in novae have been suggested, such as hydrogenburning instabilities (Pejcha 2009), re-expansion of the photosphere (Tanaka et al. 2011) , mass ejection at the re-brightening (Cs\u00e1k et al. 2005) etc. The re-appearance of P Cygni absorption at different epochs, around the re-brightening episodes, and at higher velocities confirm the scenario that periodic mass loss is happening during the re-brightening phase. Similar behaviour was also seen during the epoch of re-brightening, for example, in nova V4745 Sgr (Tanaka et al. 2011) , in which the P Cygni profiles appeared after the second brightness peak.",

The spectrum displays emission lines of H, C, N and O, typically seen in the spectra of the Fe class of novae, several of which are shown in Banerjee & Ashok (2012). The He 1.083, 2.059 m lines are present, but weak. The lines are narrow (Pa has a FWHM of \u223c640 km \u22121 ), with no P Cygni features. Although no first overtone CO emission is seen in the band, lines of Na and Mg are present, which suggest (Das et al. 2008 ) the presence of cool, low-excitation regions or clumpy material, conducive for molecules and dust to form later in the evolution; dust did indeed condense subsequently. The NIR photometric observations yielded = 9.98 \u00b1 0.02, = 8.87 \u00b1 0.03 and = 7.66 \u00b1 0.02. A recombination Case B analysis of the de-reddened hydrogen Brackett (Br) lines shows that they are optically thick. Fig. 13 shows the Br line strengths normalised to Br-12 (the typical error is \u223c 10% in the line flux measurements). The Case B emissivities at = 10000 K, and various electron densities from Storey & Hummer (1995) , are also shown. A significant deviation is seen in the Br-7 (Br ) line strength, which is expected, under optically thin conditions, to be of higher intensity compared to the higher Br series (Storey & Hummer 1995) . Such optical depth effects are expected in the early epoch spectra of novae (e.g., Nova Cep 2014, and Nova Sco 2015; Srivastava et al. 2015) . During these epochs, V2891 Cyg was undergoing the episodes of re-brightenings ( Fig. 1) , so such optical depth effects are plausible.",

We believe this behaviour indicates a short episode of dust formation and destruction. This assertion is supported by a dip in the \u2212 colour at around this time, indicating reddening by dust. The epochs of our NIR spectroscopy, relative to the dust event, are shown by vertical ticks in the lower panel of Fig. 14 . The top panel of Fig. 14 shows the change in the slope of the band continuum for 2020 May 20(+249d), when the dust had just started to form, relative to the spectrum of 2020 June 7(+267d). The latter shows a significant flattening with respect to the former, indicating the development of a clearly discernible IR excess due to dust. To esti- mate the dust mass, we fit a black-body curve (green curve; middle panel) to the excess IR emission of June 7(+267d) relative to the blue-dashed continuum of May 20(+249d).

Table 6 gives ejecta mass in M . Of these, the most reliable estimates are for the lines at longer wavelengths (viz., the Pf and Hu lines, and Br ) because their strengths are least affected by any extra reddening due to the dust (for example, beyond 3.5 m, the extinction is only \u223c 5% of any additional A generated due to the dust in contrast to \u223c 25% at Pa ). We have assumed an electron density of n = 10 7.5 cm \u22123 in the mass estimation, for two reasons. First, the smallest critical density of the ions seen during the coronal phase (Table 7 , discussed below) suggests this. Second, geometric dilution of the ejecta with time (n \u221d t \u22122 ) suggests that the lower limit on the electron density of 1.14\u00d710 9 -6.08\u00d710 9 cm \u22123 at +64d would have decreased to about \u223c 10 8 cm \u22123 during the coronal phase (\u223c 300-360d). A homologous flow would create a faster decline in the density. The mass, for any other choice of n , should be scaled accordingly. Based on this analysis, and using the Humphreys lines for arriving at a formal estimate, we obtain the mass of the ejecta to be M ej = (8.60\u00b11.73)\u00d710 \u22125 .",

Table 7 gives the details of the detected NIR lines. It is first necessary to assess whether the coronal lines are truly coronal (in that they are generated by collisional ionisation, followed by collisional excitation), or whether photo-ionisation due to a hot central source is responsible. Which of these two mechanisms is operating has been debated in the literature (Evans et al. 2003; Benjamin & Dinerstein 1990; Greenhouse et al. 1990) . In this case, the evidence suggests -for several independent reasons -that collisional ionisation is the mechanism responsible for the coronal lines, and photoionisation plays a negligible role. Greenhouse et al. (1990) define nova coronal lines as arising from ground-state fine-structure transitions in species with ionisation potential (IP) > 100 eV. Considering that the nova pseudo-photosphere collapses at constant bolometric luminosity, the effective temperature T \u2605 of the stellar remnant is empirically expected to vary as, (Evans et al. 2003; Bath & Shaviv 1976; Bath & Harkness 1989) , where 0 = 15, 280 and 3 is the time to fall three magnitudes below the the maximum. However, as novae at maximum show temperature values closer to 8000 K (see discussion in Evans et al. (2005) ), we adopt 0 = 8000 to estimate \u2605 . However we note that this formula is mostly applicable for a linear (in mag) LC decline from maximum, and our attempt here is to place limits on the temperature of the central ionising source. A similar approach had been adopted by Evans et al. (2003) for nova V723 Cas, which showed similar erratic LC like nova V2891 Cyg.",

The volume of the coronal gas is almost a factor of 100-1000 smaller than the maximum volume that the ejecta can attain kinematically, (i.e. 4/3 3 \u223c 10 45 -10 46 cm \u22123 , with = \u00d7 ; for the velocity in the range 200-500 kms \u22121 , and \u223c 371d for 2020 Sep 19). This suggests the ejecta are in the form of a thin shell with a very small filling factor. This small volume of the coronal gas (compared with the total volume of the ejecta) is also consistent with the non-detection of the UV/X-ray emission, as well as the modest amount of shock-induced dust mass estimated earlier.",

            "text": "A rather curious phenomenon is seen where the coronal lines \"migrate\" from bluer to redder velocities with the passage of time. This is demonstrated in Fig. 17 Clearly, there is a spatial stratification of the species. But the more interesting implication of this behaviour is related to the dust event. As per the model proposed by Derdzinski et al. (2017) (see figure  1 in that paper), a cool, possibly clumpy, dust shell is expected to form behind the forward shock for both the approaching and receding parts of the nova shell. Thus a plausible interpretation of the coronal line shifts is that in the June 7 (+267d) observation, the dust is dense and completely blocks the emission from the receding part of the shell. Hence the line profile is blue-shifted to the maximum. As the dust dissipates with time, more emission from the receding red component reaches the observer (as in the profiles of June 30 (+290d) and September 19(+371d)). This is a simplified interpretation, because the dust geometry could be more complex, and dust clumps could drift in and out of the line of sight, causing time-varying obscuration of the red shell (and hence evolving profile shapes as seen between the June 7(+267d), June 30(+290d), Sep 19(+371d) and Oct 26(+408d) profiles shown here). The line shift in the [Si ] 1.96 m line is also seen in the [Ca ] 2.32 m line. This behaviour may thus be confirmation that dust formation can be triggered by a radiative shock, as proposed by Derdzinski et al. (2017) , wherein as gas behind the radiative shock cools, it compresses, reaching high densities. The shocked ejecta is expected to collect in a geometrically thin, clumpy shell. If the formation of the dust in V2891 Cyg is indeed shock-induced, then this observation is likely the first time that dust formation via this route is being witnessed in a nova. Interestingly, Harvey et al. (2018) (following Derdzinski et al. (2017) and references therein) had further suggested that dust formed in the forward shock zone can subsequently be destroyed as the shock passes through this small amount of dust. However, this process retains the seed nuclei responsible for dust formation. Thus, this process of shock-induced dust formation and destruction may be repeated over the successive shock cycles. For the case of nova V339 Del, Evans et al.

Somewhat lower values of n crit are expected in cooler photoionised regions as listed, for example, in Spinoglio & Malkan (1992) and Ferguson et al. (1997) since n crit \u221d 1/2 ; equation (1) of Greenhouse et al. (1993) ). (2015) considered grain shattering by electrostatic stress due to charging of grains by UV/X-ray emission; however, as we did not notice any UV-X-ray emission in the case of nova V2891 Cyg so this mechanism is unlikely to be important.",

Our optical and NIR spectroscopy campaign lasted around 13 months (2019 Nov -2020 Dec) and utilised several facilities worldwide. The nova's light curve is of the \"jitter\" class, having a couple of episodes of re-brightening, which we propose is due to periodic mass ejection, as manifested in the line profile of the O 7773\u00c5 line. The temperature and mass of the gas containing the O are consistent with values typically seen in a similar class of novae. The absorption components of the H-are studied, and their evolution is found most likely to be due to interaction between gaseous components associated with separate episodes of previous mass ejection. A brief period of dust formation occurred during the evolution, along with the production of coronal line emission in the NIR. The analysis presented here shows that the coronal emission, most likely, is due to shock heating rather than photoionisation, and the episode of dust formation is shock-induced. These phenomena are rare in the evolution of novae. Thus, the present data set and our associated analysis would be of interest to the community to explore the physics of the nova phenomenon.",
