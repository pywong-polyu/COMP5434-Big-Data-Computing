Building on the researchers' analysis of the personal and ecological conditions that affect climate change attitudes among cranberry growers, this paper examines the effect that key actors in the growers' social networks have on those attitudes. Through statistical analysis of survey data and content analysis of two important cranberry newsletters, the paper finds that cranberry growers' perceived importance of two key cranberry growing institutions, the \"sociopolitically focused\" Cape Cod Cranberry Growers' Association and the \"technically focused\" University of Massachusetts Cranberry Station, as well as connections to other cranberry growers, is associated in nuanced ways with growers' climate change attitudes. Drawing on the sociological theory of \"social capital,\" the paper examines how these social ties to key actors/institutions may result in greater threat perception or worry about climate change.

Some conditions (discussed more thoroughly below) appear to create spaces in which actions on climate change might emerge, such as among growers who think weather is an important problem facing the cranberry industry. The search for connections between attitudes and certain conditions among growers, and whether certain social networks foster concern and action against climatic change, is a central question in this paper. In this, our research draws from the literature on grower attitudes toward climate change and literature focusing on the effects that powerful actors in social networks can have on attitudes and actions of people in the network. Are there ways in which social networks among cranberry growers are arranged that allow for climate change to be seen as a concern?

Even in the organic sector, where it might be assumed that growers hold environmental values above their conventional counterparts (Fitzmaurice and Gareau 2016; Jackson et al. 2011) , attitudes toward climate change can be unexpected. Research shows that conservative white male growers tend to be less concerned about climate change and are less likely than other social groups to believe it is occurring, which is consistent with the broader trend among U.S. citizens (Liu et al. 2014; McCright and Dunlap 2011; Running et al. 2017) .

Discussing the increased likelihood of extreme weather events and temperature variability and their effects on particular sites due to climatic change will help with mitigation and the adoption of climate-resistant strategies. In other words, framing the issue in a way that makes sense to the daily lives of growers will increase the likelihood of implementing climate adaptation strategies. The notion of framing discussions of climatic change in ways that are sensible to the local context suggests the importance of achieving trust and rapport among the stakeholders involved in the framing process as well as creating communal conditions that foster 1) an awareness of climatic change as a serious threat to local ways of life, and 2) the adoption of climate mitigation and adaptation strategies specific to the local context.

Here, growers' views of climate change might depend in part on the cultural fabric of the cranberry community, where the ideas of powerful actors are able to shape, frame, and influence attitudes and thereby encourage certain actions (Cf.

Does a grower's social network have an effect on their attitudes and the kinds of practices they engage in? Here, we are looking for social connections that might constitute \"green ties,\" ties that encourage growers to perceive the threat of climatic change as palpable, in the hope that such awareness will translate into collective action on the local level through adoption of mitigation and adaptation techniques (Adger 2003) . In this, our study joins Bourdieusian scholarship on social capital, which focuses on the perceptions of the importance (or influence) of actors, processes, or mechanisms in a network, perceptions that provide insights into the makeup of social ties in a network (e.g. Bourdieu 1985; Sanginga et al. 2007; Pretty 2003; Jones et al. 2009 ).

Those with influence can shape what is deemed important to the network of actors and influence the communal conditions of production of those operating in that network. 1 We apply this theoretical frame to the case of cranberry production in Massachusetts. In Massachusetts, cranberry growers are connected to a range of organizations that exist to support and sustain the cranberry industry. The result is a tightly knit community in which production and livelihood are intimately fused together. Organizations with important social ties to cranberry growers include the University of Massachusetts (UMass) Extension program and the UMass Cranberry Station in particular, the Cape Cod Cranberry Growers' Association (CCCGA), the cranberry cooperative Ocean Spray, and other cranberry handlers. Also making up the communal conditions of production are cranberry growers' involvement with one another through family ties, grower meetings, the annual Cape Cod Cranberry Harvest Festival, their pest control advisors, and similar connections. The social links that growers develop with one another provide powerful ways of sharing knowledge and other forms of support among themselves. Yet, social capital research points to the importance of the social ties made through connections to influential actors outside the personal relations of individuals, whether these are state or non-state organizations, in establishing certain \"ways of knowing\" within the social network (Adger 2003) . Do certain social ties in the social network of the cranberry growers' community foster greater concern for climate change among them than among other socially networked growers?

Gareau et al. (2018) find that Massachusetts cranberry growers' attitudes toward climate change are not only affected by their personal conditions but are also contextualized by the ecological and communal conditions of cranberry production. With regard to personal conditions, the authors find that cranberry growers who identify as women and those who have college degrees are more likely to view climate change as a threat and to worry about it. With regard to ecological conditions, cranberry growers who report weather in general as an important condition are more likely to see climate change as a threat. However, attitudes toward climate change are more varied when growers single out individual weather conditions for consideration. For example, identifying insufficient chill hours during winter (a climatic change in New England that is particularly damaging to cranberry production) is positively associated with the likelihood of seeing climate change as a threat and worrying about it. The fact that there is little growers can do to compensate for the insufficient chill hours may well account for this view. Growers can regularly irrigate their cranberry bog, which helps reduce the risk of frost when cranberry plants break dormancy too early during an insufficiently or inconsistently cold winter, but this is a laborious and water-intensive operation and does not solve all the problems caused by insufficient chill hours. Gareau et al. (2018) argue that to cope with the warming winter temperatures, cranberry growers will need to increasingly rely on their communal networks (i.e., communal conditions of production) and their sponsorship of such measures as the development of new cranberry varieties with higher frost tolerance and requiring fewer chill hours. Influential actors might tap growers with higher levels of climate awareness to increase awareness among the cranberry grower community. On the other hand, Gareau et al. (2018) find that perceptions of water scarcity and competition for water are not associated with climate change attitudes among cranberry growers, perhaps because of the growers' long history of collectively coping with the variable precipitation levels that are typical in New England (Playfair 2014) . In any case, cranberry bogs are highly resistant to drought and flooding, so it is quite possible that cranberry growers would take longer to identify changes in these ecological conditions as problematic. Gareau et al. (2018) also find that control of certain ecological conditions of production is associated with climate change attitudes: An increase in the acreage of wetland habitat owned by the cranberry grower increases the odds of worrying about climate change, while an increase in upland habitat owned reduces those odds. Gareau et al. (2018) speculate that this may be because ownership of wetland habitat prompts cranberry growers to be more attuned to the impacts of climatic change on the water resources in these habitats. Contrastingly, ownership of dry upland habitat, by allowing for other forms of agricultural production and other money-generating activities such as selling sand and gravel, may offer a protection against, and reduce attention to, the climate impact on cranberry production.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 257, "end": 277, "text": "Gareau et al.

The first variable, management practices count, measures the number of management practices that cranberry growers reported to have implemented in their bogs in the past 5-10 years. In the survey, we asked growers: \"Which of the following management practices have you implemented on your bog in the last 5-10 years?\" Growers were to select all that applied from a list of practices we provided, including integrated pest management, sanding, late water, \"smart\" irrigation and/or frost alarm, organic amendments, conservation or creation of pollinator habitat, and other. Respondents who chose \"other\" were invited to elaborate on their responses in the survey; we then recoded these into three additional categories: water recovery, other1, and other2. \"Water recovery\" was supplied by several respondents as an answer in the \"other\" category; \"other1\" and \"other2\" denote idiosyncratic explanations of the \"other\" category that are unique to specific respondents, which we recoded in this way to account for them in management practices count. We also model one dependent variable on a specific management practice, pollinator habitat conservation, which is a binary variable capturing whether growers have implemented pollinator habitat conservation in the past 5 to 10 years (1 = yes, 0 = no). Cranberries require animal pollination to set fruit (Armstrong 2016) . With global findings of biomass and biodiversity loss amongst insects and other pollinators due to environmental degradation and climate change, and with continued threats of parasitism and disease among honey bees (Apis mellifera L.) commercially managed for agricultural pollination, this management practice is essential for the continued sustainability of cranberry production. The third variable, management practices importance, captures growers' responses to the survey item, \"On a scale of 1 to 5, have some or all of these management practices become more important over the past 5 to 10 years?\" (a 1 to 5 scale: not important to very important).

For example, one grower told us that growers would often convene at the UMass Cranberry Station in Wareham, MA, to collaborate on addressing common problems such as weed control and share their latest inventions. (The industry is so small, growers often make their own equipment and share the designs.) Again illustrating the importance of both fellow growers and the UMass Cranberry Station, another grower told us how they and their father \"frequently went to the UMass Cranberry Experiment Station for advice, camaraderie, and conversation. And if growers had a problem, the UMass Station would send people to the bogs to help the growers free of charge\" (pers. comm.). Interviews with growers at the 2017 Cranberry Harvest Festival, held in Wareham, MA, describe the CCCGA as an important actor that promotes both the tradition and modernization of cranberry growing. In particular, growers expressed their appreciation for the CCCGA exhibit \"Rhapsody in Red: 200 Years of Massachusetts Cranberries,\" and how the organization worked to promote the shared relationships among cranberry farms in the wider community.

In both organizations, actors publish newsletter content in line with the values and priorities expressed both in their mission statements and on their webpages. We performed content analysis in two stages. First we did a \"conventional\" analysis by reading through all issues, coding loosely for common themes, and creating word clouds to illustrate the most common topics of discussion (Hsieh and Shannon 2005). These findings were then compared with the priorities outlined in each organization's mission statement. Second, we performed a more specific \"summative content analysis,\" which allows for an indepth examination of a topic already determined to be of importance, in this case, climate change (Hsieh and Shannon 2005). The summative content analysis that we employed is focused on the framing and context within which climate change is presented. Framing, \"involves the intentional or inadvertent crafting of a message to describe an issue, place responsibility, and/or suggest solutions\" (Mossler et al. 2017: 63) . To examine the framing of climate change references in the newsletters we first searched for the phrases \"climate change\" and \"global warming\"; we considered any use of one of these phrases as a reference to climate change. We also searched for the term \"climate\" alone and qualitatively determined whether the instance was a reference to climate change specifically or to climate in general. The climate change references were then examined in combination with the \"broader meanings present in the data\" that were identified during the conventional analysis (Hsieh and Shannon 2005: 1285) . In this way, a summative content analysis focused on the framing of climate change can take in the \"underlying\" and \"contextual\" meanings that surround climate discourse in these newsletters with specific attention to how climate change is described as an issue, who is responsible for mitigation, and what types of solutions are to be implemented (Mossler et al. 2017 ).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1381, "end": 1406, "text": "(Mossler et al. 2017: 63)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1968, "end": 1978, "text": "(Hsieh and", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1979, "end": 1998, "text": "Shannon 2005: 1285)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2349, "end": 2369, "text": "(Mossler et al. 2017", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Content analysis: newsletters"}, {"text": "Around half of the respondents (46 out of 91) view all three social ties (to the CCCGA, to UMASS Extension, and to other cranberry growers) as important.

Among the three social networks, we find that the growers who view the CCCGA as important are more likely to consider global warming as a serious threat to their way of life during their lifetimes, compared to the growers who do not consider it an important network, as shown in Table 2 , below. This finding holds true even after we control for the variables on personal and ecological conditions of cranberry production that were found in our earlier study to be significant predictors of the perception of global warming as a threat (Gareau et al. 2018: 14-15 ). According to Model 1, when cranberry growers who do not view the CCCGA as an important network are compared to growers who do value the CCCGA, the odds of the latter group considering global warming a serious threat is about 10 times higher (i.e., 11.349 \u2212 1 = 10.349) than the former group (a = 0.05). This positive association is also observed for a smaller sample (N = 74) in Model 2 that includes other relevant independent variables, albeit at a different statistical significance level (a = 0.1). In both Models 1 and 2, the odds ratios for view CCCGA as important are notably larger than those of other significant predictors. This might be because it is a binary variable rather than an ordinal or continuous variable like the other significant predictors (with the exception of female, which is also binary and has the second largest odds ratio in Model 2).

The difference between \"worry\" and \"threat to the way of life\" might have something to do with the different ways these powerful actors influence the cranberry growing community.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion and conclusion"}, {"text": "It is noteworthy that the social ties among cranberry growers that foster communal conditions supporting worry about climate change parallel the ties created by the UMass Cranberry Station. Although growers may feel threatened by the impacts that climate change can have on certain aspects of their growing operations, this does not necessarily translate into feelings that climate change threatens their \"way of life\" or that they feel \"worried\" about it. Social ties among growers, therefore, might lead to different interpretations of climate change depending on the specific dispositions of the growers in their network. For example, the \"personal conditions\" of gender and age of other growers with whom they are connected were found to be significant predictors of climate change attitudes (see Gareau et al. 2018) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 801, "end": 820, "text": "Gareau et al. 2018)", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion and conclusion"}, {"text": "This analysis also sought to discover whether certain social networks are associated with the adoption of management practices that address climate change. We find that climate change attitudes are, to various degrees, associated with cranberry growers' ties to important social actors (i.e., ties to the CCCGA, UMass Cranberry Station, and other cranberry growers), yet none of the perceived importance of these powerful actors is associated with the actual implementation of climate adaptive management practices. This finding suggests that both the CCCGA and UMass could refine and strengthen their outreach to growers regarding climate change mitigation and adaptation strategies. For example, although both newsletters discuss many different management techniques, including those that could be considered climate adaptive strategies, none of the references to climate change found in these samples emphasizes these types of practices.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion and conclusion"}, {"text": "It is important to acknowledge the limitations of our findings on a couple of levels. For one, the statistical analyses were conducted based on 91 survey responses, which is a relatively small sample. As noted in the methods section, however, our sample accounts for roughly one quarter of the population of cranberry growers in Massachusetts, which makes it an adequate sample for statistical inference about the population (Salant 1994) . Nonetheless, the power of hypothesis testing is limited by the small sample size, especially in models that include additional control variables. We partially mitigated this issue by using an alpha level of 0.1 and, when applicable, more parsimonious models, such as the generalized ordered logit regression models, over other alternatives. We are also limited to trusting the growers when they report to us that certain actors are indeed important to them. Moreover, it is challenging to determine in our survey data the strength of the social interactions between the cranberry growers and these three social actors. Whether growers in the survey attended the many UMass Cranberry Station meetings, thoroughly read each and every monthly Bogside or Cranberry Station Newsletter issue, or routinely engaged in activities with fellow growers is not directly captured in the survey. Our findings, however, suggest that the connection between growers and the CCCGA is strong enough to create a pattern of influence on climate change perceptions among growers connected to this powerful actor, which is also supported by participant observation and in-depth interviews not reported in detail in this paper. Second, allowing growers to self-report the importance of certain actors creates a potential for endogeneity and might impose a limitation on the research findings concerning network ties. We are confident, though, that self-reported importance is worth discussing, mainly because it is widely understood among growers and researchers that CCCGA, UMass Cranberry Station, and grower networks are all important actors in this tightly knit, growing community. As a unique growing community of only 400 or so in number, cranberry growers rely heavily on their networks to remain viable in this struggling industry. Our findings suggest that connections to CCCGA are raising awareness among growers about the connections between those struggles and climate change. Finally, there are limitations to the ways we introduce management practices to the growers. By limiting the count of management practices to activities undertaken in the past 5-10 years, the measure systematically excludes individuals who may have taken certain long-term actions more than 10 years ago. We focused on this time span so that the survey results matched the time frame of the newsletters included in our content analysis, which extends to years in the Cranberry Station Newsletter.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 425, "end": 438, "text": "(Salant 1994)", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion and conclusion"}, {"text": "Social networks are clearly an integral aspect of understanding cranberry grower attitudes and actions toward climate change. As the example of DeMoranville's comment in The Christian Science Monitor cited earlier suggests, the CCCGA and UMass Cranberry Station's official communications are also augmented by the climate discussions that powerful actors in these networks have in the mass media. A November 2012 USA Today article titled \"Global Warming Targets Thanksgiving,\" for another example, quotes Brian Wick, the current CCCGA Executive Director, saying, \"The growers are at the point where there's concern that the climate is changing. We are seeing these sort of extremes in weather\" (Montgomery 2012) . Or again, a 2015 Cape Cod Times article titled \"Climate Change: Heat May Drive Cranberry Industry North,\" which cites both DeMoranville and Wick; DeMoranville expresses concern for recent patterns of \"big rain events with long dry periods in between,\" and says, \"Eventually, if it got hot enough, you would come to a time when you couldn't grow cranberries\" (Fraser 2015). However, the article reports, neither DeMoranville \"nor Wick see that happening anytime soon\" (Fraser 2015) . These examples show that there are key actors in these social networks who are willing to discuss climate change as a threat, although, as with our newsletter findings, they do not necessarily advocate for immediate collective action.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 694, "end": 711, "text": "(Montgomery 2012)", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 1181, "end": 1194, "text": "(Fraser 2015)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion and conclusion"}, {"text": "In sum, identifying the CCCGA as important is associated with greater odds of perceiving climate change as a threat, and identifying the UMass Cranberry Station as important is associated with greater odds of worrying about climate change. This illuminates a need for these social actors to work together more closely to foster more powerful green ties bridging their disparate connections to climate attitudes. Although these organizations already collaborate to an extent (for example, Bogside often includes a section written by the UMass Cranberry Station), our findings highlight that these two organizations represent two distinct fields of knowledge in the cranberry industry. The technical focus of the UMass Cranberry Station seems to complement the socioeconomic and sociopolitical focus of the CCCGA. However, when it comes to encouraging growers to consider climate change as a serious threat to their way of life-a threat calling for immediate action-their differing knowledge frames for now seem to prevent a deeper connection and interdependence with one another that could more consistently and forcefully convey what needs to be done about the impact of climate change on the cranberry industry. Climate change needs to be framed as a problem that is vast and socio-environmental (Givens et al. 2019; Huang 2018) , but also one with many tangible effects on specific, local processes (Adger 2003) . By avoiding both social and natural reductionist thinking, this framing enables an understanding of climate change that allows the severity and complexity of the problem to be expressed, and acted upon (White et al. 2016 (White et al. , 2017 .
