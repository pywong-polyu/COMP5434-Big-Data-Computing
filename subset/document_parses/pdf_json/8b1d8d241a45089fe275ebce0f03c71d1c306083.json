Environmental context refers to the context in which a person lives, works, and socializes. This paper presents a social marketing strategic planning model which begins by analyzing the micro, meso, and macro environments to identify causes or influences of a target social issue or problem. Contributors to the social problem are prioritized with respect to the degree to which they exert influence or causality. Next, stakeholders (those who have some interest in the social problem) are identified. Stakeholder perceptions and values are examined in order to develop an effective coalition of stakeholders who can work collaboratively at the various environmental levels to ameliorate the target social problem. As social marketing has evolved in order to develop more effective solutions to complex social problems, integrating a systems approach is useful to understand the dynamics influencing the social problem. Individuals are not targeted myopically but placed into an environmental context to understand and respond to influences on unhealthy behaviors and living conditions. Engaging a coalition of stakeholders who are motivated to alleviate the causes of the social problem must be skillfully managed by social marketers but offers promise in addressing complex social problems.",

Advocating for change was insufficient to effect change without a better alternative. Thus, Wymer (2011) developed a social marketing strategic planning model to provide social marketers with a disciplined approach for identifying the major causes of a targeted social problem so that social marketing programs could be developed with greater effectiveness. The strength of Wymer's model is in identifying major influences of a social problem. The weakness of Wymer's model is that he viewed the social marketer as working independently and apart from other stakeholders who might have a positive contribution to make. Domegan et al. (2020) and Hastings and Domegan (2018) developed another social marketing strategic model, also aimed at increasing the effectiveness of social marketing programs. Whereas Wymer's (2011) model sought to improve social marketing effectiveness by providing a structured approach for identifying the most influential causes of a social problem for ameliorative targeting, Domegan's model sought to improve social marketing effectiveness by promoting a multi-level stakeholder coalition. Domegan et al. (2020) systems model promotes a collaboration among stakeholders as a means of gaining more cooperation in developing and implementing a social marketing problem that can achieve greater effectiveness in improving the target social problem. The strength of the systems model is that it brings together multiple stakeholders at different levels in the marketing system to form a coalition which could potentially have a greater impact on the social problem than if a lone social marketer worked independently without the collaboration of other stakeholders. The weakness of the systems model is that it assumes that a group of diverse stakeholders can be effectively led and managed in such a way that their diverse interests and perspectives will work collaboratively with synergy to substantively improve a wicked social problem.",

PFOA leaked into the community's water from Dupont's landfill waste disposal site. It was ultimately discovered that the corporation knew about the potential harm of PFOA for decades (Bilott 2019; Soechtig and Seifert 2018) . And, as an example of a pathogen at the macro/society level, phthalates are a class of chemicals that are used to soften plastics, bind fragrances in products, and act as solvents and fixatives. Baby bottles, teething rings, and toys are (or used to be) made with phthalates or bisphenol A (BPA). These chemicals, in the body, suppress or mimic hormones and disrupt normal development and growth (Children's Environmental Health Network 2010). The presence of these pathogens from the US chemical industry has exposed a good portion of the American population to a greater risk of attentiondeficit hyperactivity disorder, breast cancer, obesity, type II diabetes, low IQ, neurodevelopmental issues, behavioral issues, autism spectrum disorders, altered reproductive development, and male fertility issues (Westervelt 2015) .",

Encouraging a collective response in alleviating a social problem from a coalition of stakeholders is a challenging but potentially effective means of generating a complex, multi-level series of actions to mitigate causes to a social problem. Stakeholders may have different perspectives, values, and incentives. It may be impractical and selfdefeating to attempt a coalition of all stakeholders. Some stakeholders may be intractable. Other stakeholders may be invested in maintaining the status quo and might work against the coalition's progress. Hence, the coalition would be best served by stakeholders who can agree on overall goals in dealing with a social problem.",
