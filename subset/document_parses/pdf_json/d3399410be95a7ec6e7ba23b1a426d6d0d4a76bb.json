One nurse tested positive with a phylogenetically distinct variant, after a documented infection 83 days prior. Three key points were taken from this investigation. First, it was controlled by adherence to existing guidelines, despite increased transmissibility of the variant. Second, viral sequencing can inform transmission cluster inference, but the epidemiological context is essential to draw appropriate conclusions. Third, reinfections with Alpha variants can occur rapidly after primary infection.",

Study sequences were compared to contemporaneous sequences (derived from GISAID) and sequence NURSE-007-S2 was more similar to contemporaneous Alpha variants from the Netherlands (1 nucleotide difference) than to other sequences from the outbreak (Fig. 2b) to which it differed by 2 nonsynonymous SNPs (Fig. 2b, ORF1a : H2125Y, ORF8: L118V). This would suggest that introduction from the community was a more plausible source of infection than hospital transmission. However, during the outbreak period, the national relative contribution of Alpha was estimated at less than 4% [4] . Moreover, this nurse had clear epidemiological links to other nurses at the ward. Nurse 007 had an overlapping shift on day 5 with a nurse that experienced COVID-19 related symptoms that day (Fig. 1, Nurse 003) and several overlapping shifts with nurses testing positive on day 15 and 16. Overall, the epidemiological data combined with phylogenetic analysis strongly suggests within-hospital transmission was the main route of transmission during this outbreak, but the source of transmission for NURSE-007-S2, the reinfection case, remains uncertain. Samples NURSE-007-S2 (collected day 10) and NURSE-007-S1 (collected 83 days prior to NURSE -007-S2) were both collected from nurse 007 and were unrelated (Fig. 2a, blue circles) , thereby confirming a reinfection with an Alpha variant within three months after primary infection with lineage B.1.177, that was dominant in Europe since the summer of 2020 [1] .

Firstly, a rise in SARS-CoV-2 cases at an orthopedic ward was confirmed to be an outbreak using genomic sequencing, with most genomes being identical or 1 SNP different. This outbreak with variant Alpha was controlled by adherence to existing guidelines, despite increased transmissibility of the variant illustrated by high attack rates to household members (57%%, compared to 16.6% previously estimated among 77 758 household members from 54 relevant studies) and close contacts (50%, compared to 5.9% among family and friends, 1.9% in the workplace, and 1.2% among casual close contacts) [5, 6] . This reiterates the importance of adherence to prevailing infection prevention methods to prevent transmission among HCWs. Interestingly, no high-risk contacts were reported by the 11 HCWs that tested positive. This could indicate an increased risk for transmission during lowrisk contacts during an outbreak with the Alpha variant. It is more likely, however, that self-reported risk behavior was underestimated [2] . This is congruent with the fact that increased adherence to existing guidelines controlled the outbreak.",

            "text": "The outbreak management team was formed at day 13, directly after the results of sequencing reported the Alpha variant and universal testing for nurses was added to the containment strategy. Although the outbreak was controlled within a short period of time (16 days), three nurses developed symptoms during their shifts. Universal testing earlier into the outbreak, might have reduced the number of affected nurses and has been introduced as a routine policy in our hospital since this investigation [7] . Two of the cases in this outbreak were family members who were involved in the caregiving process. The family members did not leave the patient room and both family members and nurses wore masks when providing care for the patient in question. As the incorrect wearing of masks was presented by the nurses as a potential cause for transmission we suspect that the inadvertently touching of masks during patient care, and thereby contamination of the surroundings of the patient might explain nurse to family member transmission. It cannot explain why the patient itself was not affected. Other visitors were rarely present at the ward during this outbreak and were able to adhere to social distancing policy. We hypothesize that visitors were therefore less at risk to contract the infection. Secondly, while rare, reinfections with the Alpha variant can occur rapidly after primary infection with a preceding lineage such as B.1.177. Reinfection rates associated with the Alpha variant prevalence are similar to the rates of preceding lineages, but a reinfection within 90 days remains noteworthy [8] . Guidelines state that a positive PCR result within 90 days of initial symptom onset without new symptoms (as was the case in here) is unlikely to be the result of a reinfection, but rather represents persistent shedding of viral RNA [9] . This study highlights that viral sequencing is an essential tool to investigate new positive PCR results with 90 days of primary infection.",

If the reinfection case was indeed related to the outbreak, the two mutations observed could reflect true evolutionary changes in the viral genome (the average rate is 2 substitutions per month) or, and perhaps more likely, could reflect some form of technical artefact, which have been discussed elsewhere [10] . This outbreak illustrates the complexity of transmission cluster inference for viruses with low genetic diversity such as SARS-CoV-2: identical sequences are not sufficient evidence for transmission, but sequences with a one or two nucleotide differences are equally not sufficient evidence to exclude relatedness. Weighing the genomic data in light of the epidemiological context is essential to draw appropriate conclusions about outbreaks like the one described here. ",
