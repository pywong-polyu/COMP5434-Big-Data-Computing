            "text": "On September 15th 2008, Lehman Brothers went bankrupt and sent financial markets into free fall, freezing up credit that even manufacturing industries rely on to operate. Global capitalism as we know it was in cardiac arrest, and the public outrage over the blatantly unethical credit schemes on a systemic-wide scale (CDOs and CDSs) resulting in trillions of taxpayer dollars spent on failing banks, has taken many forms. One initially rather discrete act of defiance comes through by way of an encrypted message to a small mailing-list of hackers calling themselves 'Cypherpunks' [30] . The mail was sent by someone under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto, who made the audacious claim of having cracked the code that will free us from this current and failing banking system (Nakamoto 2009 ). Apart from Wikileaks and Julian Assange, the Cypherpunk movement had been as hidden from public view as the very combination of the Cyberpunk ethos in conjunction with a fetish for cryptography would see fit. In the ascending age increasingly marked by what Zuboff [32] will later refer to as one of surveillance capitalism, cryptography and cyberpunk is not as odd a pair as one might think. Much less for dwellers in the cyberpunk universe with striking embodiments from William Gibson's modern classic Neuromancer to films like Bladerunner and the Matrix, in which it becomes increasingly apparent that escaping the gaze of an all-powerful AI assisted state and/or dominant corporate agendas essentially means to move out of sight. Not unlike a rigged game of oligopolistic finances that wins for the monied few and occasionally loses for all. Thus, the unknown voice under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto must have laid out words as welcome as they were familiar to Cypherpunk and primary addressee Hal Finney, when allegedly having cracked the money code with the blockchain innovation associated with Bitcoin, Satoshi claimed to have created 'the absolute autonomy of money' [23] .",

In the case of Japan on the other hand, the Covid 19 pandemic has among other things accelerated the discussion among government authorities to promote a shift to a more cashless society (sovereign virtual currency) instead of the more habitual use of 'dirty' cash that they fear may exacerbate viral contagion. This is by no way to equate the lethal pathogen of the pandemic with money or monetary innovations in any form, nor to make too much of the cleanliness aspect of certain types of money as opposed to others, whether physically or symbolically. Nevertheless, the way one country confronts a lethal pathogen or for that matter a disruptive innovation that threatens established institutions, may each in their own way reveal something about the culture through which one response or other is borne out. In a similar vein, we expect the global spread of cryptocurrencies and the blockchain technology that essentially enables money and monetary transactions to function in the absence of centralised authority such as governmental institutions in charge of monetary policy, to invoke quite different responses that reveal culturally significant tendencies around central tropes like that of 'autonomy' ranging from one culture to the other.",

In other words, the empirical component of the paper explores how users in Japan and Sweden reason about this new technology, and in the light of each emergent culturally situated discourse on the subject matter, we may discern how different attitudes and behaviours reveal the cultural and ideological proclivities and tensions on the ethical meaning of autonomy in each country. Our aim is to illustrate some of the differences or similarities between Japan and Sweden regarding their respective use and the salient discourses around cryptocurrencies and the possibility of money without centralised authority or third-party control. Moreover, our ambition in so doing is to tease out what this may say about the broader ideological and cultural issues that we discern to be associated with such culturally specific nuances. A mixture of qualitative and quantitative methods will seek to identify and explore the separate cultural, institutional and historical contexts between empirical differences in the rate of adoption and use of virtual currencies among users, and the discourses under analysis here will help us accentuate the significance thereof.",

To facilitate such analysis and to access the most fertile fora within which users interact and elaborate on the meaning of the technology, we have chosen discourse analysis of social media as the most suitable approach in this regard by way of enabling us to monitor how significances are understood, articulated and evolve over time. The more precise approach will be further explained in the methodology section, where we elaborate further on why we have chosen to conduct a Foucauldian inspired discourse analysis on social media to accentuate the power beyond individuals that such media along with his particular philosophy make strikingly clear. This analysis we argue, not only captures the power dynamic apparent in social media under analysis, which we also deem to be a more immediate and unfiltered representation of user attitudes than the editorialised narratives of established media. It also gives a more nuanced illustration of the relational aspect of power and how certain interactions of words and concepts will enact power in such exchanges, rather than through any one particular individual exerting it.",

It is perhaps understandable that this very technology of transferability and permanence mastered around 600 BCE in Lydia of Anatolia, as well as in the Ganges Valley and in city states around the Yellow river of what is now modern-day China, at about the same time [11] , is when the evolution of money becomes increasingly visible to historians and archaeologists. Indeed, it was a tremendously significant development in its own right. However, it did not set off the story of money as we know it because money is not necessarily embodied in objects to be passed around to facilitate transactions, but had instead existed at least since the ancient Sumerians started inscribing precise debt relations among its citizens on clay tablets about 2500 BC. It is in fact here and not with the much later innovation of coined money that we start to see a system of inscribed debt relations that for the first time starts to function as money, as long as the integrity and incorruptibility of these tablets sufficed to sustain public trust therein.",

This in spite of the fact that there is scarcely any empirical evidence of any barter societies ever existing, and in turn a great deal of evidence of various forms of credit arrangements preceding coinage [11] .

Indeed, for anyone hoping to provide a firm ideological grounding for the free market, not to mention founding the discipline of Economics in the case of Smith, the story worked hand in glove so to speak. Not only did it illustrate the natural inclinations of trucking and bartering as fundamental to the human condition, nor just showing how hopefully inconvenient these double-coincidences of demand must have been working before coined money came along as a technical fix. However, perhaps most importantly the story salvages this ideological view of history from having to grapple with the foundational role of state and central authority. Not to mention the inherent inequality of debt being endemic to the free market and not just the eventual outcome and modern financial innovation they much rather envision credit arrangements to be [11] . In other words, money is not necessarily the object of exchange but rather the precise social relation that is being quantifiably assessed through an impersonal system of value exchange, be it through inscription, possession of specific objects such as coins, paper bills or otherwise.",

In retrospect, it appears that the state/credit theory has been more historically accurate in this debate all along considering the archaeological and anthropological insights we now have about Sumerian scriptures testifying to top-down central authority and debt relations, as opposed to barter and organically generated commodity money characterising early monetary systems. Moreover, debt relations imply power imbalances and centralised authority (or state function) to safeguard recordkeeping, not the most popular notions among free market enthusiasts, whereas the more ideologically resonant barter story imply natural human bartering inclinations creating markets and by extension money as stand in commodities to facilitate such transactions.",

This we argue equally applies to the innovation of cryptocurrencies explored here, which we will unpack further in the following section as it relates to Sataoshi's famous claims about creating 'the absolute autonomy of money', as well as the ethical implications associated therewith. To better grasp the essence of money, however, to then move on to discuss its implications for autonomy and ethics in the following section, the first step in the present section has been to tease out how its history has not been immune to the many ideologies that have endeavoured to try and account for its essence and characteristics in various ways. Now, in spite of the justified critique of Smith's idea regarding the historical accuracy of commodity money emerging organically through the market and the obvious ideological bias associated therewith, could we not perhaps read the ascent of cryptocurrencies as at least a partial vindication of Smith's [28] idea albeit in retrospect? At least it is now clear that blockchain technology for one may supplant the need of a state for centralised top-down authority for something to function as money. What is more, cryptocurrencies bring to the fore this very ideological kernel that has been at the heart of this debate since Smith [28] came to formulate his position, and it is precisely by embodying the very proof of a decentralised form of money independent of any state or centralised monitoring authority, that it has such an appeal and why it pertains so strikingly to the question of autonomy in ethics.",

However, it is only with the ascent of the Enlightenment and most notably with Immanuel Kant that autonomy becomes a primary concern at the individual level, where as it were Kant's view would envision individuals reaching maturity through assuming autonomy by way of reasoning for oneself rather than deferring authority onto tradition, state, church etc. Autonomy according to Kant refers to a moral agent's ability to freely and rationally adopt moral policies and act accordingly [17] , which holds a rather optimistic view of human faculties in the absence of circumstances constraining our freedoms. This may perhaps in some sense be true of Foucault as well, although in a less optimistic vein as the space of autonomy is diminishingly small if even at all possible considering the ubiquity of normative and disciplinary discursive signifiers that not only constrain our freedoms but infuse our very attempts to exercise it.",

In addition, it is disciplinary towards the broader public in the sense of ushering in a normativizing and medicalising vocabulary that apart from generating various forms of delinquency and measures against it, also provides a powerful framework for what it means to be normal and sane. This is what Foucault ( [7] , p. 43) means when defining discourse as not only that which was \"already said\" as in the text itself, but also that which is \"not-said\" or \"never-said\" by which he means a form of silent potential that may become actual in the way we experience discourse.",

In taking this theoretical move from the earlier Foucauldian (cf. [7] ) writings on The Order of Things, to later works such as Discipline and Punish (1980) to its logical conclusion, provides us with a rather different understanding in which the autonomy of individuals as understood by Kant is largely undermined. Indeed, this is where Foucault [7] shifts the idea of agency away from the individual and from an archaeological reading of so-called epistemes in terms used, rather accentuating the relational nature of power through a more genealogical understanding of discourses that generate their own form of agency (cf. [4, 31] ).",

In particular, they use a frequency count of individual words as a useful submethod to highlight how important certain concepts are to people. Co-location of common concepts then allows researchers to infer correlations between concepts and their significance, which can be verified manually using other qualitative means. Baker [1] for example, uses critical discourse analysis in his review of UK media bias, and plots how the different types of words are used linguistically in combination with one another.

We had intended to use the SpaCy library for both the Swedish and Japanese datasets, since the package has models trained on social media posts, however, a Swedish language model was not available at the time of writing. Consequently, we used the Stanza package which is trained on the Talbanken treebank (SBX). This lemmatisation step is perhaps not strictly necessary for the Swedish data, but is useful for adjusting the output if we, for example, wanted to analyse sentiment at a later date.

After lemmatisation, the Swedish corpus consisted of 39,147 tokens. Figure 2 shows the most frequent words for both countries that appear together, when translated to English. What is interesting to note about these results are the differences and similarities in relative usage of particular terms. For example, Sweden has a much higher relative usage of the words 'Money', 'Bank', 'Crypto', 'Currency' and 'Value'. Looking more broadly at the rest of the data, both Sweden and Japan have a similar relative usage of the word 'Investment'. Whilst this is a reflection of the relative frequency of tokens occurring throughout the datasets, these differences Fig. 2 Most frequent words that appear in both the Japanese and Swedish data and similarities may have underlying cultural causes which can be of interest to this study, and can thus, offer a potential direction to target our efforts for the discourse analysis. Does Sweden consider virtual currencies to offer a replacement to the traditional monetary systems, more so than Japan, for example? Figure 3 shows the coherence scores for 1-20 topics for the Swedish data. For the Japanese data, the highest coherence was at 10 topics. For the Swedish data, the highest coherence was at 6 topics, but we see a second peak at 11 topics.

It is also clear from our empirical accounts that this increase in autonomy is something that appears to have more intrinsic value among Swedish users than among their Japanese counterparts.

Just like coins enabled for instance the ancient Greeks greater autonomy over their material conditions and the ability to trade their way out of poverty, so too blockchain powered cryptocurrencies may be an option for among others the two billion unbanked poor of the world to become part of the financial system. These people are currently excluded from any banking system on account of bureaucratic practices that come with centralization, and the decentralisation of autonomy brought forth by the blockchain offers an opportunity to overcome such precarious conditions. Money is essentially a form of impersonal power that may command the labour of others and the way we can exercise this power will undoubtedly have a profound impact on our autonomy, yet some cultures may cherish this autonomy more than others depending on a range of factors including trust in public and private institutions and ultimately in one another.",
