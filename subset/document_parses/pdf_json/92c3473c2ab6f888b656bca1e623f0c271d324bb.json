From the outset, we believe these authors recognised that their mission to provide real-time analysis in a timely and reflective manner was a Sisyphean task, as at the time of this writing, over 113 635 publications have been posted on PubMed and MedRxiv alone, largely in the past 12 months (search date 14 February 2021). To their credit, the systematic review process in the accompanying literature search 2 even included a 'hand search' of the ever increasingly quoted 'grey literature' consisting of the torrent of press releases on new drugs and therapies. These types of sources in the COVID-19 field are of particular importance as they are often amplified by social media, creating what some may refer to as 'epistemic chaos', and posing an increasing threat to the iterative method of science (eg, the early embrace of hydroxychloroquine). Thus, these points to consider should be viewed as ephemeral and will need ongoing curation to maximise their value in the months ahead.",

            "text": "We now have strong efficacy data reported for three different vaccine constructs: 90%-95% for mRNA vaccines from Pfizer 3 and Moderna, 4 89% for a proteinconjugate vaccine from Novovax 5 and somewhat lesser efficacy for the adenoviral vaccines that have recently reported. Interestingly, the adenoviral-based Astra-Zeneca vaccine reported 62% efficacy in Brazil, but markedly higher efficacy in England (90%), where mistakenly a half-dose was used as the primary vaccination followed by the correct full dose. 5 The adenoviral-based Janssen vaccine reported 72% efficacy in a one-dose trial; data from their phase III trial using two doses are still pending. 5 We know that these vaccines provide neutralising antibody titres and measures of cell-mediated immunity equal to or greater than that found in convalescent plasma of those with prior wild-type infection. 6 We hope this implies more robust protection and for longer time periods than does natural infection, and there are data to support longer-term durability of vaccine-induced immune responses. 6 Interestingly, while second cases among individuals have been reported (and in some cases had worse outcomes), the incidence of second cases in the 6-9 months after infection appears to be small, with as few as <1% being reinfected as documented in a large public health study in England. 7 So what does this mean for those with immune-mediated inflammatory diseases? Most of our understanding of vaccine responses in rheumatic disease and the influence of disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) on those responses has been generated by a small number of studies involving influenza, pneumococcal and tetanus vaccines, and less commonly others. In general, rituximab is well known to severely reduce the humoral response to vaccination. Both methotrexate and JAK inhibitors have been shown to decrease response to influenza or pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccinations. Tumour necrosis factor blockers and interleukin (IL)-17 blockers have been shown to have little or no effect on these vaccines. 8 Very little data exist for abatacept, but likely responses are diminished. 8 From an efficacy standpoint, it is likely that some of these DMARDs will diminish COVID-19 vaccine immunogenicity, raising the need to study these practical questions as soon as possible. From a safety standpoint, phase III trials have not raised any serious safety concerns, and the postmarketing period is remarkably devoid of serious adverse events despite widespread scrutiny and millions of individuals having been vaccinated. The safety of these vaccines remains to be seen in rheumatology patients, however. No vaccines currently available (or expected to be available in the near future) are live replicating vaccines, including the adenoviral vaccines, and therefore are not contraindicated in immunosuppressed patients. The potential for COVID-19 vaccines to induce disease flare or potentially new autoimmune and/or autoinflammatory complications remains unquantified. This is of particular relevance as the impact of downstream effects of innate interferon responses generated particularly by the mRNA vaccines remains unknown. Thus, efforts such as the EULAR COVAX database (https:// www. eular. org/ eular_ covid19_ database. cfm) where rheumatology providers can report untoward effects from COVID-19 vaccines are vitally important.",

            "text": "The intersection of COVID-19 and autoimmunity is complex and bidirectional. 3 For patients with pre-existing clinical or subclinical autoimmune/autoinflammatory diseases, there is potential for their 1 Editorial disease and/or therapies to have an effect on the clinical course of COVID-19 infection, as well as the potential for their disease to be influenced by the infection after recovery (figure 1). For those without apparent autoimmune/autoinflammatory diseases, there is the potential for new-onset immune-mediated diseases which have been anecdotally reported 9 and await more critical appraisal. In terms of laboratory evidence of autoimmunity, it should not be surprising that numerous groups have documented the presence of autoantibodies including antinuclear antibodies 10 11 and antiphospholipid antibodies 12 in patients with COVID-19 as mechanistically viral infections have long been known to disturb immunological tolerance. 3 The biological importance of these observations remains unclear, but recently, a series of intriguing studies have suggested that these autoantibodies not only may be associated with clinical disease but also may be functioning as drivers of immunopathogenesis. The work of Knight and colleagues 12 has demonstrated that not only are antiphospholipid antibodies detectable in the majority of patients with severe COVD-19 but also these antibodies were highly capable of driving thrombosis in a preclinical model used to study immunothrombosis. Mechanistically, the work of Sanz and colleagues 10 not only documented the presence of autoantibodies in patients with severe COVID-19 but also described that such patients displayed hallmarks of extrafollicular B-cell activation previously described in SLE. 13 In early 2021, a series of investigations have now further documented new-onset IgG autoantibodies in hospitalised patients with COVID-19 14 and in a multicentre effort led by Utz and colleagues 15 have demonstrated reactivity to antigens associated with rare autoimmune diseases and even more frequently against cytokines correlating with immune response to SARS-CoV-2. Finally, an intriguing study by Combes and colleagues 16 has demonstrated that patients with severe COVID-19 produce antibodies which functionally inhibit interferon-stimulated gene expression via an Fc-mediated mechanism. Collectively, there is a growing case that autoreactivity is more than an epiphenomenon of the autoantigenome 17 potentially leading to alternative immunotherapeutic approaches that include apheresis and other strategies. Further work is urgently needed.",

How such patients will be managed and what the role of rheumatology will play in research and management of such patients are yet undefined. 20 21 For now perhaps, the most immediate challenge is to define the aetiopathogenesis of such symptoms which hopefully will inform potential therapies. Rheumatologists may have a larger role in managing such patients if inflammatory and or autoimmune mechanisms are found culpable, but this mechanism is but one which we propose is possible (box 1). For now, the immediate challenges must start with careful epidemiological and classification exercises, then move to defining potential mechanisms, before finally determining where our specialty will be placed in management of such patients. It is likely that clinical trials for such patients will include at some point immune-based therapies as they have in acute COVID-19 and where rheumatologists have played important roles.
