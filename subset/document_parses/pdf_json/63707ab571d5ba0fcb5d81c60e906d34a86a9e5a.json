Univariate analysis was used to evaluate demographics and clinical factors associated with COVID-19 mortality. We used Kaplan-Meier survival analysis to estimate the patient survival fraction and the stratified logrank test to compare the difference in survival distributions between different groups. Time to events (death) was defined as the time from illness onset to events. Two groups were created, 'death' and 'recovery', to study the relationship between high-risk factors and mortality from COVID-19 using hazard ratios (HRs) generated by a Cox LI ET AL. 1625 proportional hazards regression model. A forward selection procedure was then used to construct an initial model. Based on clinical experience, a final model was selected. Proportional hazards assumptions were systematically verified for the proposed models. Hypothesis testing was conducted using a two-sided test, and an alpha value of 0.05 indicated statistical significance. A forest plot was created based on multivariate Cox regression results.

Lactate dehydrogenase greater than 300 U/L is another independent high-risk factor for mortality. Increased lactate dehydrogenase was related to heart failure or MOF, which may lead to the fatality from COVID-19.17 SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with inflammatory mediators that may play important roles in cardiac and arrhythmic complications.[18][19][20] A previous study reported that16.7% of patients with COVID-19 had arrhythmia, and 7.2% had acute heart injury.6 However, other studies have reported that the incidence of arrhythmia in patients with COVID-19 was only 0.3%, which was relatively low.21,22 In our study, to the best of our knowledge, we first reported ECG characteristics in critical patients. We found that the incidence of arrhythmia was approximately 45.7% in critical patients and that the incidence of ventricular arrhythmia was high in patients with myocardial damage and in patients who died. Sinus tachycardia and ventricular arrhythmia were independent ECG risk factors for mortality in critical inpatients with COVID-19. Furthermore, there was no difference in the QT interval between patients who died and survivors, and there was no significant difference in ST-T abnormalities between patients with and without myocardial damage. Taken together, these results showed that critical inpatients with COVID-19 are prone to ventricular arrhythmia or abnormal ECG results, which is caused by myocardial damage.",
