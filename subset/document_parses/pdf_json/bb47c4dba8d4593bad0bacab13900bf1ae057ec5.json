World Health Organization has declared as a pandemic in January 2020 [1] . The first case has been reported in Wuhan city of Hubei Province in south China on 31, December 2019 as unidentified pneumonia [2, 3] . COVID-19 disease has been identified as a member of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) that outbroke also in South China in 2002-2003 [4] . This disease is developed in the human body in the presence of a coronavirus. The coronavirus has been described in 1966 by Tyrell and Bynoe [5] . The virus is divided into four categories namely alpha, beta, gamma, and delta. Bats are a major source of alpha and beta virus category of the coronavirus. While gamma and delta originate from pigs and birds. Among these viruses, beta can infect human beings. The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, tiredness, and dry cough. Some patients may have aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea. Around 1 out of every 6 people who get COVID-19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing [6] . COVID-19 is a transmissible disease. Hence, peoples get infected with coronavirus from others (COVID patients) by coughs or sneezing [7] . No vaccine or antiviral treatment is available till now. The mortality rate is increasing day by day. The rapid spread of the COVID-19 may be due to multiple causes. One cause is the lacking of information transparency at the early stage of the epidemic outbreak. Releasing the epidemic information in a timely and accurate way is extremely important for the anti-epidemic response of the public. The authentic and transparent information could have prohibited the spread of the COVID-19 at the early stage. The other cause is the lacking of the scientific diagnostic criterion for the COVID-19. As preventive measures, all the major countries have canceled events, classes in schools and colleges, businesses have pushed work from home policies. All of these measures are adopted to slow the spread of the disease. These measures are broadly referred to as social distancing. In the present manuscript, a mathematical model is being developed for estimating COVID-19 disease. Also, the proposed model incorporates the social distancing parameter for better spread estimation.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 130, "end": 133, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 263, "end": 266, "text": "[2,", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 267, "end": 269, "text": "3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 416, "end": 419, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 563, "end": 566, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1103, "end": 1106, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1242, "end": 1245, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Mathematical modelling has gained more attention and awareness in epidemiology and the medical sciences [8, 9, 10, 11] .

It estimates the number of cases in worst and best-case scenarios. Susceptible-Infected-Removed (SIR) and Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Removed (SEIR) models are the most studied and used models to estimate disease spread. These models are helpful in estimating the effect of preventive measures on disease spread. The SIR model originated from the study of the plague almost one hundred years ago. This model estimates spread by using contact rate and infection period only. It has been observed that this model is not suitable for estimating the spread in which the incubation period is involved such as COVID-19. Hence, the SEIR model is a suitable model for estimating COVID-19 spread since it incorporates the incubation period. However, the SEIR model failed to estimate the spread where preventive measures are adopted such as social distancing.

The performance of the proposed mathematical model works in two different modes. The first mode works on the classical SEIR model in which the value of the social distancing rate \u03c1 is fixed to 1. In this mode, the spread of disease depends only on the contact rate \u03b2. The result obtained by proposed mathematical model with \u03c1 = 1 and \u03b2 = 1.5, \u03b2 = 1.75 and \u03b2 = 2.0 has been shown in the Figure 4 .

It can be also analyzed that if this spread has been followed then the maximum 35% population could have been suffered from COVID-19 disease in 30 days. The second mode is with different social distancing rates. The results obtained have been shown in Figure 5 . It has been analyzed with about 300 active cases. It can be easily analyzed from the green dotted line that spread is about 10% in 10 days which is approximately the same as COVID-19 disease spread after applying social distancing in India.
