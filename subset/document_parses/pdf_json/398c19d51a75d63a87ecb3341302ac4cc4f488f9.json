Methods: We conducted a prospective case-control study nested within the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) cohort. Participants were 513 pancreatic cancer cases and 1020 matched controls. Concentrations of 22 POPs were measured in plasma collected at baseline. Results: Some associations were observed at higher concentrations of p, p'-DDT, transnonachlor, b-hexachlorocyclohexane and the sum of six organochlorine pesticides and of 16 POPs. The odds ratio (OR) for the upper quartile of trans-nonachlor was 1.55 (95% confidence interval 1.06-2.26; P for trend \u00bc 0.025). Associations were stronger in the groups predefined as most valid (participants having fasted >6 h, with microscopic diagnostic confirmation, normal weight, and never smokers), and as most relevant (follow-up !10 years). Among participants having fasted >6 h, the ORs were relevant for 10 of 11 exposures. Higher ORs were also observed among cases with microscopic confirmation than in cases with a clinical diagnosis, and among normal-weight participants than in the rest of participants. Among participants with a follow-up !10 years, estimates were higher than in participants with a shorter follow-up (for trans-nonachlor: OR \u00bc 2.14, 1.01 to 4.53, P for trend \u00bc 0.035). Overall, trans-nonachlor, three PCBs and the two sums of POPs were the exposures most clearly associated with pancreatic cancer risk.",

Notably, all four previous studies 1,4 measured POP concentrations in blood samples drawn at the time of diagnosis of pancreatic cancer, thus being prone to disease progression bias, a form of reverse causation through which the pathophysiological progression of the disease before diagnosis alters concentrations of the lipophilic contaminants in biological samples; as a consequence, disease-altered exposure estimates lack aetiological significance. All four studies found some POPs associated with pancreatic cancer risk; 1, 4 together with the other relevant studies, [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] 11 their findings were of reference in designing the present study.",

The median length of follow-up of participants was 11.6 years. 1 A total of 513 pancreatic cancer cases were included in the present study: 135 from Denmark, 79 from Sweden and 299 from the other mentioned countries. 1 Exclusion criteria were: (i) cases of endocrine pancreatic cancer; (ii) occurrence of other malignant tumours preceding the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer, except for non-melanoma skin cancer; (iii) participants diagnosed with pancreatic cancer during the first 2 years after blood draw (5 years for cases from Denmark); and (iv) cases with less than two straws of plasma remaining available. 1 Cases were diagnosed from 1995 to 2014. For each case, two control participants alive and free of cancer at the time of diagnosis of the index case were selected using an incidence density sampling procedure 13 ; only six cases had just one control. Thus, a total of 1020 matched controls were included. Matching factors were study centre, sex, age at blood collection, date and time of the day of blood collection, fasting status and, for women, use of exogenous hormones. 1 Characteristics of participants were also previously published. 1 At study entry, a higher proportion of cases than controls were current smokers (33% vs 23%, respectively), and had diabetes mellitus (6% of cases vs 3% of controls); no differences between cases and controls were observed for body mass index (BMI), total lipids and its components, alcohol consumption or physical activity. Smoking was barely associated with POP concentrations (Spearman's rho from \u00c00.16 to 0.15), very similarly in cases and controls.",

When a linear trend was apparent, the test for such trend was the multivariate analogue of Mantel's extension test. 13 Models were built based on four causal scenarios, two of which (A and B) were a priori deemed more relevant for the present study; they both suggested that more valid estimates are obtained when crude POP concentrations are analysed. 1 In addition, we also present results from models using lipid-corrected POPs and adjusting for BMI and smoking.",

Columns show results for the predefined 1 most valid stratum of three variables: fasting (>6 h), diagnostic basis (microscopic confirmation) and normal weight, and for the most relevant stratum of the interval between blood extraction and date of cancer diagnosis of the index case (index date) (follow-up !10 years). Results for the most valid stratum of smoking (never smokers) are shown in Figure 1 associated with an increased risk of pancreatic cancer were also associated with other, unmeasured contaminants also associated with an increased risk. Our planned analyses include assessing: the joint and separate impact of POPs, dietary patterns and anthropometric factors on pancreatic cancer risk; the possible mediating role of type 2 diabetes in the association between POPs and that risk; and the possible mediating role of POPs in the association between type 2 diabetes and such risk. In this report, we did not adjust the associations between plasma concentrations of POPs and pancreatic cancer risk by dietary factors 24 because diet is a common source of POPs. 13 The influence of diet and other lifestyle and personal factors on POP concentrations in cases and controls will also be undertaken soon. 16, 22 Future studies with even larger sizes might analyse differences in risks among countries.",
