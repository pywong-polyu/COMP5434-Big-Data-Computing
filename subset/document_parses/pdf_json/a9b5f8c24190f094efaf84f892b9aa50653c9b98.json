According to a representative public opinion survey 34% of Hungarian citizens believe that corporations are responsible for climate change. The business sector is motivated to take an active role in the mitigation and adaptation of climate change. As a result, the last few decades saw a marked increase in corporate measures aiming at the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, as well as other initiatives to tackle climate-related problems which result in numerous social issues. The aim of this paper is to assess whether Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) can be applied as a tool in agribusiness fostering steps towards the implementation of the climate-oriented and sustainable agriculture in Hungary. The research makes an effort to explore the role and opportunities of the Hungarian agricultural sector in adapting to climate change, it also examines the extent of the mitigation and adaptation activities appearing in the CSR portfolio of the companies and what specific measures are taken to realize them. The results of the evaluation show that climate-oriented CSR activities of the companies are relatively undeveloped, but businesses are working to reduce the impact of climate change on the usage of exercising adaptation strategies. There are several actions that can help to reduce vulnerability to the consequences of climate change in the agriculture sector. The results can support not only companies but other decision-makers decisions in climate-oriented CSR activities in agribusiness.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Global climate change has already had a noticeable impact on the environment and socioeconomic circumstances as well. Scientists have conviction that global temperatures will continue to rise, largely due to greenhouse gases produced by human activities. The Fifth Assessment Report of the IPCC has contributed with a scientific input into the Paris Agreement, which aims to limit the global temperature increase to 1.5 \u00b0C above pre-industrial levels (IPCC 2014) . Achieving a 1.5 \u00b0C would require a 55% reduction in global greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 compared to 2017, and a 25% reduction for 2 \u00b0C as well. In 2017, humanity produced 53.5 gigatons of greenhouse gas emissions (UN Environment 2018) . Sustainable development goals make a new framework to consider climate action. The 2019 UN Climate Action Summit reinforced that the world needs to work to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. The Summit presented the need to increase the short-term commitments by 2020 and the mid-term commitments by 2030. Businesses showed that they are moving to take climate action. Result of the Summit, 10 regions, 93 businesses committed to reach carbon neutrality by 2050, 87 businesses have committed to implement the 1.5 \u00b0C target across their operations and value chains (UN 2019). As a result, a marked increase seen in corporate measures aiming at the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and 19 food and agribusiness companies on eliminating deforestation, preserving biodiversity, restoring natural ecosystems and regenerative agriculture. Changes in global, regional and local climatic conditions underpinned by exposure indicators, through the changes in temperature and precipitation patterns, have a significant impact on agricultural outputs and adaptation strategies. Adaptation trends seem to be evolving, farmers are taking steps to prevent the negative effects through more precise sowing period, precision farming and more efficient species although farms have different inputs, climatic factors and soil characteristics; therefore, different adaptation procedures may be applied by different regions (Olesen et al. 2010) . According to the latest IPCC Report activities during 2007-2016 globally accounted for 13% of carbon dioxide, 44% of methane and 82% of nitrous oxide emissions from human activities which is 23% of the total net anthropogenic emissions of GHG (IPCC 2018) . The work of the IPCC's Fifth Assessment Report on impacts, adaptation and vulnerability clearly shows that without proper adaptation, the effects of climate change will have a negative impact on agriculture (IPCC 2014) . The need for adaptation depends primarily on the extent of climate change, geographical location and available economic, environmental and social resources. Therefore, adaptation research is one of the most dynamically developing research directions within the discipline of climate change (Bosello 2014; Porter et al. 2014; Isoard 2011; Moser 2011; Briesbroek et al. 2013) . Assessing good agricultural practices and the factors that influence farmer decisions are important tasks. Adapting to the effects of climate change, environmental research and good practices have been the subject of several studies. According to scientific results, the effects to agriculture may take a very heterogeneous directions in crop production (Olesen and Bindi 2002; Chavas et al. 2009; Hatfield and Prueger 2015; Vanschoenwinkel et al. 2016 ) and in animal husbandry (Key and Sneeringer 2014; Qi et al. 2015) .

The main objectives of these national programs were to analyse the impacts of climate change, to understand global climate change and there expected impacts on meteorological, social and agricultural terms and to formulate proposals for a national adaptation strategy (Bir\u00f3 et al. 2018) . The main objectives of these national programs were to analyse the effects of climate change, to understand global climate change and its expected effects in meteorological, social and agricultural terms, based on which proposals and tasks were formulated for the development of a common national adaptation strategy. The Hungarian VAHAVA (\"Changes-Impacts-Responses\") project, that was supported by the Hungarian Academy of Sciences and the Ministry for Environment and Water between 2003 and 2006, resulted in a breakthrough in research related to climate change in Hungary (L\u00e1ng et al. 2007 ). The program made five recommendations to the domestic adaptation strategies (Harnos 2007) and two objectives were formulated. On the one hand to get people and economy prepare for the increased extreme weather, to bear warmer-drier periods and their impacts. On the other hand, to create and develop the organizational, infrastructural and financial conditions that will be needed for a rapid response to the harmful impacts of unexpectedly extreme weather (Farag\u00f3 et al. 2010) . The Agrarian Climate project is a complex study to predict the impact of climate change on agricultural production in the period of 2014-2018. The main objective of the project is to build a decision support expert system (Czimber et al. 2015) . The project call attention to the implementation of sustainable agro-ecological farming along the formulated adaptation processes and measures (Nem\u00e9nyi 2015) . The Climate Impact (Complex assessment of climate change impacts) project analyse the effects of climate change on natural and agricultural ecosystems, such as mapping of soil vulnerability (M\u00e1ty\u00e1s 2015), analysis of risk management options for crop production efficiency (Nem\u00e9nyi 2015) , examination of the results of sensitivity studies in maize production (Ny\u00e9ki et al. 2015) . The AGRAT\u00c9R project aims to extend the National Adaptation Geographic Information System (GIS) to the agricultural sector. Within the framework of the project, the most important field crops and grasslands close to nature in Hungary were examined. The results of the research point out that lower summer precipitation will cause serious droughts. These projects also show that agriculture is one of the most exposed sectors to climate change (Dockerty et al. 2005) .

Hungary produced 2% of the agricultural goods output of the European Union in 2018 (European Commission 2019b). The proportion of agricultural land (including arable land) is higher than the EU-28 average. Farms in the EU managed 39% of the total land area of the EU as utilized agricultural land, as well as wooded areas (6.2%) and other farmland not used for agriculture (2.1%) (Fig. 1) . Yohannes (2016) analysed documents on the relationship between climate change and agriculture. The documents were concluded that climate change has a strong relationship with agriculture in developing countries, because their livelihood depends on agricultural activities which mainly depend on climate. The impact of climate change is significant in developing countries because of their restricted adaptive capacity and lack of technology. Furthermore, those countries belong to the main emitters. Sustainable agriculture can help to reduce GHG emission through energy conservation, lower levels of carbon-based inputs, lower use of synthetic fertilizer. With the appropriate farming practice agriculture could be the solution for climate change by mitigation and adaptation strategies (Yohannes 2016) . Land and forests have significant potential for carbon capture and storage. Non-carbon GHG emissions will always be associated with agricultural production but can be reduced through efficient and sustainable production methods (European Commission 2018). Agriculture contributes 30-40% of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions (Thornton and Lipper 2013) . Three-quarters of agricultural greenhouse gas emissions appear in developing countries and this share may rise above 80% by 2050 (Smith et al. 2007 ). Although agriculture still plays an important role in the national economy, its importance continuously decreases due to the plentiful problems it faces. The increasing agricultural production has continuously increased the emissions of long-lived greenhouse gases. An Italian study provides an overview of the principal models that can be used to estimate the effects of climate change on agriculture. The classification scheme presents that a model is able to simultaneously consider many aspects related to climate change and classifying these in different classes (Salvo 2013). Aryal et al. (2019) presents a review of the impacts of climate change in the agricultural sector and adaptation options in smallholder production systems in South Asia.

Hungarian agriculture is one of the driving forces of the national economy. In Hungary the share of agricultural area, in particular arable lands, within the total area is high even in international comparison. Land use ratios within agriculture (predominance of arable land) reduce ecosystem services, and intensive production methods weaken the land productivity (NCSD 2020). In 2019, 57.1% of the total agricultural area is under cultivation (5309.5 thousand hectares) ( Table 1) .

Hungary's carbon dioxide emissions have fallen by about 40% since 1990 (N\u00c9S-2 2018), but further reductions are needed in the light of international obligations. The most important strategy for climate change is the Second National Climate Change Strategy (N\u00c9S-2) for the period of 2018-2030, which also provides an outlook for the period 2050. The main source of GHG emissions come (2019) from the energy, 2 industrial, 3 agriculture and waste sector. The sectoral distribution of the country's GHG emissions depends largely on the economic structure. In 2017 total emissions of GHGs in Hungary were 63.8 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalents (CO2eq) excluding the Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry (LULUCF) sector. Taking into account also the mostly carbon-absorbing processes in the LULUCF sector the net emissions of Hungary were 58.3 million tonnes CO2equivalent in 2017. Being about 6 tonnes the Hungarian per capita emissions are below the European average (the EU average is 9 tonnes per capita). The most important GHG is carbon dioxide accounting for 78% of total GHG emissions. The main source of CO 2 emissions is the burning of fossil fuels for energy purposes, including transport and households. The largest emitting sector was the energy sector 4 contributing 72% to the total GHG emission in 2017. Agriculture was the third-largest greenhouse gas emitter in Hungary with 11% (Fig. 2) . The three most important greenhouse gases are carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide. Agricultural activities mainly produce methane and nitrous oxide emissions. Methane represents 12% in the GHG inventory while nitrous oxide contributes 7% to Hungary's total GHG emissions.
