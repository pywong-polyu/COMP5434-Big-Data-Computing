            "text": "Dai was the first to try to elucidate why blood group O carriers tend to have better outcome when infected with COVID-19. His hypothesis relied mainlyon the relationship of O blood group to ACE2 tissue expression. Hypertension is the leading cause of mortality and represents the most important risk factor for the development of cardiovascular diseases. Hypertensive patients typically have over-elevated ACE (Angiotensin Converting Enzyme)/ANGII (Angiotensin II) axis, in which ACE positively regulates the level of angiotensin II (ANGII) in the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAS). ACE 2 is the entry receptor of SARS-CoV-2 into the cells and is one of the key regulators of tissue tropism of COVID-19. Higher levels of ACE2 were positively associated with heavier intracellular load of SARS-CoV-2, and linked to worst outcomes including ventilation, myocarditis, and endotheliitis. It was reported that the ABO blood group is associated with ACE activity and ACE inhibitor-induced cough among Chinese patients with essential hypertension. That is, the GATC haplotype of the four polymorphisms of the ABO gene (rs8176746, rs8176740, rs495828, rs12683493), which is prevalent among non-O blood type patients, is positively associated with ACE activity. Thereby, O blood type carriers should have lower ACE2 levels, which can offer an additional explanation to the milder manifestations of COVID-19 in blood group O carriers [19] .",

Within the literature, there appears to be a relationship between the ABO blood groups and several autoimmune diseases. This association, examined through frequencies, disease severity, risk factor, is significant enough to consider the ABO blood groups a clinical parameter for performing genetic testing for these diseases. Moreover, an association exists between ABO groups and inflammatory processes evidenced by interactions unique to blood group antigens, which affect host-pathogen interactions, as well as disease susceptibility between individuals. This is evidenced by studies that have revealed that circulating glycoprotein levels, that are critical in endothelial function and inflammation, are majorly determined by ABO blood type [20] . Evidence suggests the possibility that ABO blood groups may influence the prognosis of some diseases by affecting the inflammatory status of its patients. A predilection of blood type A to more inflammatory end points appears to be common.",

In this study, blood group A individuals exhibited a higher %G (Guanosine) + C (Cytosine) microbes, dominated by Actinobacteria when compared to other blood groups. Actinobacteria are a group of Gram-positive bacteria with high guanine and cytosine content in their Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) [45] . Actinobacteria are reported to be increased in chronic inflammatory conditions as, in Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis [46] . Notably, another study showed that Blautia was lower in the group A-secretors compared with the non-A-secretors, (O and B) and the highest abundance in O-secretors [47] . Blautia is a species of anaerobic, gram-positive bacteria found in the gut. They showed a beneficial antiinflammatory role, along with other relevant Taxa, in the recovery process from Vibrio cholerae infection and microbiota maturation in children [48] . In addition, the Blautia genus was decreased in irritable bowel syndrome, nonalcoholic fatty liver diseases, Crohn's disease, and diabetes. This might relate to the favorable prognosis in COVID-19 among type O individuals and the poor prognosis in Blood type A.",

The same prevalence is shared by metabolic syndrome, related complications, and elderly individuals. Using ABO blood grouping for risk stratification and determination of patients in need for close follow up should be combined with other previously mentioned stratification markers, whether clinical such as the age, diabetes and obesity, or laboratory such as CRP, ferritin, and IL-6.

Anti-A antibodies in group O individuals is mainly of the Ig G type, while in type B persons it is mainly Ig M.
