            "text": "This study aimed to investigate the antimicrobial, antibiofilm, and cytotoxic effects of biosurfactant lipopeptides synthesized by Bacillus subtilis TR47II. For this purpose, the lipopeptides were partially purified using a three-step process and characterized. In the first step, the crude extract obtained from acid precipitation exhibited strong antibacterial activity against the Gram-negative opportunistic pathogens Alcaligenes faecalis ATCC 8750, Achromobacter xylosoxidans ATCC 13138, Pseudomonas alcaligenes ATCC 14909, and Pseudomonas putida ATCC 15175. Moreover, partial inhibition was observed against Klebsiella aerogenes ATCC 13048 (42%), Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 (16%), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853 (47%). The lipopeptides in the crude extract were extracted with methanol and fractioned on a silica gel chromatography column, rendering four TLC-pooled chromatographic fractions, named F1, F2, F3, and F4. The chromatographic fraction F4 was the most bioactive, with MIC values between 300 and 600 \u00b5g mL \u22121 . Besides, F4 at sub-MIC doses dislodged the biofilms of A. faecalis, A. xylosoxidans, and P. alcaligenes by about 100, 85, and 81%, respectively. No cytotoxic effect was observed in mammalian cells at MIC. MALDI-TOF-MS analysis revealed that F4 contained cyclic lipopeptides belonging to two families: iturins (m/z 1004 to 1087) and fengycins (m/z 1424 to 1545). The dual effect of F4 on planktonic and sessile growth could suggest that the synergistic application of these biosurfactants could be efficient in the control of these opportunistic pathogens.",

Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) already causes 700,000 deaths/year and it is estimated that 10 million deaths due to AMR will occur every year after 2050, with an associated economic loss of $100 trillion for the global economy (O'Neill 2014; Tran et al. 2015; World Health Organization 2016; Tagliabue and Rappuoli 2018) .

            "text": "Bacterial biofilms represent a concern in the hospital environment due to the resilience of chemical control. Besides, these structures are frequently involved in pathogen dissemination and hospital-acquired infections. As evident from Fig. 4 , challenging the biofilms of A. xylosoxidans ATCC 13138, A. faecalis ATCC 8750, and P. alcaligenes ATCC 14909 with F4 lipopeptides dislodged the mature biofilms, and the extent of biofilm disruption was found to be concentration-dependent. Upon treatment at sub-MIC doses, biofilms of A. faecalis, A. xylosoxidans, and P. alcaligenes were dislodged by about 100, 85, and 81%, respectively. Generally, the concentration of antimicrobial compounds necessary to damage sessile cells present in biofilms is much higher than the concentration required to be effective against planktonic cells. Overall, these results indicate that different factors may be responsible for the antimicrobial and antibiofilm activities of biosurfactants produced by strain TR47II. Rautela et al. (2014) demonstrated that the extract containing fengycin and iturin produced by Bacillus amyloliquefaciens AR2 was able to remove biofilms of Candida albicans. Tabbene et al. (2015) demonstrated that bacillomycin D can remove biofilms of C. albicans in a concentration-dependent manner, with 90% of removal at a dose of 25 \u03bcg mL \u22121 . Rivardo et al. (2009) demonstrated that fengycins produced by Bacillus sp. inhibit biofilm formation by E. coli CFT073 and S. aureus ATCC 29213 (97 and 90%, respectively). Thus, the application of iturins and fengycins produced by B. subtilis TR47 II to abiotic surfaces can represent an effective strategy for reducing bacterial adhesion after biofilm formation.",

The results from the cytotoxic effect of F4 against mammalian cells is shown in Fig. 5 . The chromatographic fraction F4 is non-cytotoxic at MIC (assumed value of 300 \u00b5g mL \u22121 ). There was no effect on the growth of MAC-T cells in a concentration equal to or less than 4 \u00d7 MIC. Upon this concentration, the growth was retained in approximately 37% relative to the control. Exposure of Vero cells to fraction F4 in a concentration equal to MIC reduced growth by 22% over control. However, the reduction of cell growth with increasing F4 concentration was less abrupt than that observed for MAC-T cells, maintaining approximately 57% growth in a concentration equal to 16 \u00d7 MIC (equivalent to 4800 \u03bcg mL \u22121 ) (Fig. 5) . As follows, the lipopeptides in F4 appear to be selective for bacterial membranes. Microbial biosurfactants are generally considered to be low toxicity or nontoxic compared to synthetic surfactants. They are, therefore, suitable for use in the pharmaceutical, cosmetic, and food industries (Nitschke and Costa 2007) .",
