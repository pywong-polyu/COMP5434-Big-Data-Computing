In the current situation with rapidly increasing demand for SARS-CoV-2 assays the focus is on the availability of test materials (smear material, test reagents) and test capacities. At present, there are essentially two indications for the use of PCR diagnostics. The first is the detection of the pathogen (or another cause of the current clinical symptoms), the second is the identification of possible contagiousness after the symptomatic phase of the disease. Especially in the second case the results of the PCR examination should be critically evaluated. In contrast to other PCR examinations, or laboratory medical analyses, currently SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic information about the device or the detection limit / sensitivity is not usually provided by the laboratory. Therefore, we investigated the influence of the type of transport medium and of two widely used commercial purification reagents on the sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 detection. We compared these results with an automated detection system.",

To avoid possible fluctuations in sensitivity at low concentrations caused by the low amounts used in the tests, multiple determinations were carried out at a dilution of 10 -4 in the experiments with different virus media. Using a protocol without purification of viral RNA, i.e. the Munich Extraction Protocol (MEP) [2] , we could show that the type of transport medium had little influence on the detection sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 in the PCR (Table 1) .",

When using the MEP it was not advisable to use increased volume in the test series of the different types of transport media, as these were directly inserted into the PCR without purification.

This is due to the fact that there is little RNA present due to the limit of detection. If a little more RNA molecules are present in one sample (via a suction effect through the pipette or by thermal influences), this may be sufficient to generate a small but measurable signal. Statistical thermodynamics provides another explanation. At high dilutions, RNA and primer molecules must find each other to react together. If this happens at the beginning of the PCR, the RNA is doubled in each PCR cycle. The earlier that this occurs, the more likely it is that a measurable signal is obtained at the end of the PCR. This is clinically very relevant: It affects the question of whether or not the person has to be quarantined. For people working in the field of critical infrastructure, this means whether or not they are allowed to remain in active service. If not, this can result in a significant reduction in staff numbers, especially in hospitals.",

It is known from other virus diseases that there is no longer any risk of infection after passing through the disease although the virus can be detected up to now [3] . In the case of SARS-CoV-2, it was shown that from the 8th day after the onset of symptoms, although viral RNA was still detectable in the throat, no infectious virus particles could be isolated [4] . This indicates that a \"healing\" of COVID-19 cannot be proven by PCR examination. It should be considered whether information on the detection limit / sensitivity should not be given so that a better classification of the significance of the result of the PCR measurement is possible.",

The question arises whether this is sufficient. It is not possible to define the necessary and clinically relevant sensitivity at this time. For the systems mentioned in Tables   2 and 3 there were delivery bottlenecks, so that delays occurred in analysis and thus in compilation of findings and patient evaluation / isolation. The next step would be to consider quantification. Unfortunately, the necessary reference materials are not currently available for this. But even in this case, the clinical relevance of the number of copies for contagiousness should not be disregarded.",

            "text": "Does the analytical laboratory have a way of detecting borderline findings? In this context the Cp or Ct value (cycle threshold; both terms mean the same) is often cited. The Cp value indicates the number of cycles after the signal has been measured when the fluorescence signal from the exponential increase of the amplification of the virus is significantly above the background fluorescence for the first time. Cp values greater than 38 are considered an indication of lower amounts in the sample. It should be noted, however, that this value is only a relative measure of the concentration of the target in the PCR reaction, as it is influenced by many factors (reaction efficiency, method of determining the Cp value) [5]. Therefore Cp values from different PCR assays cannot be compared. The Cp value also depends on the pre-analysis (type of swab: gel, dry, transport medium). Due to the many factors influencing the Cp value, no recommendation should be made at this point as to whether or not it should be used for evaluation. If colleagues are unsure, it can only be recommended to consult the treating physician at this point and ask for the clinical situation of the patient.",
