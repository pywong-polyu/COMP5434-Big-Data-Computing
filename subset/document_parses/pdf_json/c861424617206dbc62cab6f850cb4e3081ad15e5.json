[2] [3] [4] [5] Annual costs attributable to ACEs across a range of risk factors and causes of ill health have been estimated to be $1.3 trillion across Europe and North America 6 and \u00a342.8 billion in England and Wales. 7 Internationally, local and national policies are prioritising the prevention and response to ACEs. 8 9 Movements such as ACE-Aware Scotland (UK), the California ACEs Aware Initiative (USA) and Welsh strategy to create 'ACE aware' services (https://www. aceawarewales. com/) seek to promote a response to ACEs, including increased ACE awareness. Awareness of ACEs and their associated life-course harms is increasing among professionals, including those employed within public, Strengths and limitations of this study \u25ba A mixed methods approach was used to evaluate the film, including a short survey with professionals, and retrospective analysis of public reaction and interaction with the film on social media (Twitter and YouTube). \u25ba An examination of attitudes towards the film according to individuals' adverse childhood experience (ACE) exposure was included to measure sensitivity of this approach of message conveyance to individuals with such experiences. \u25ba ACE exposure was self-reported and measured retrospectively and therefore is vulnerable to issues of recall and willingness to report. \u25ba Survey data were anonymous which prevents follow-up to explore long-term memorability or any impact on practice from viewing the film. \u25ba Analysis of Twitter data provides the ability to explore dynamic responses and demonstrate reach, but is limited to user accounts which are publically available, who are not likely to be representative of the general population.",

            "text": "Open access youth and third sectors. 10 However, there is a dearth of knowledge on how information on ACEs can be effectively communicated to professionals or more broadly to the public. Following ACE prevalence studies in Wales (national) 11 and England (national and regional), 12 13 a short animated film on ACEs (https:// youtu. be/ XHgLYI9KZ-A) was developed by Blackburn with Darwen (BwD) Borough Council and Public Health Wales (PHW). The film was designed to act as a professional training tool to communicate information on ACEs, their potential to damage health across the life course and the roles that different agencies can play in preventing ACEs and supporting those affected by them. The film lasts 5 min and 43 s and provides the narrative of a young boy growing up with ACEs-'one person's story on how ACEs affected their life'. The film suggests the impact his exposure to ACEs may have on his physical health (eg, development of cancer, heart disease, early mortality), mental health (eg, impulsivity control), involvement in health-harming behaviours (eg, alcohol use, smoking, violence perpetration), educational attainment (eg, school truancy, expulsion) and the potential generational transmission of ACEs (eg, exposure of his future children to subsequent ACEs). The film highlights the need for services (eg, health, police and education) to be ACE aware. It shows how, with the support of services, the boy is able to have an alternative life course and his future children prevented from being exposed to ACEs. The film therefore not only highlights the harm that ACEs cause but also shows how support can provide resilience to help individuals' follow different life trajectories. After being piloted within professional training, the animation was published online on 28 April 2017 and shown at a variety of relevant professional stakeholder conference and training events. The film was made freely available on the social media platform 'YouTube' (with embedded links to the video hosted on BwD Borough Council and PHW webpages). Three language versions were produced (English language and accent, English language with Welsh accent and Welsh language). Subsequent films on the theme of ACEs have been created in the UK by NHS Scotland and the Early Action Together Police and Partners ACEs Programme. However, to date no studies have examined the response towards the use of such short animated films as a tool to deliver public health messages on ACEs. Even when adopting a broader examination of public health messaging, the evidence base for the use and impact of films is limited, as film interventions are rarely evaluated and their impact is often not systematically assessed. Public health messaging needs to capture attention and convey messages to a wide audience in an accessible format. However, only a few studies examine the use of animated films to convey such messages, often focusing on the provision of education to children, for instance, on dental caries. 14 Some research does indicate that the use of animated cartoons in communicating public health messages leads to higher message recall. 15 We sought to add to the evidence base on the use of films for public health messaging, by evaluating professional and public reaction to the short ACE animated film. The evaluation included an examination of professional and public reaction to, and interaction with, the online ACE animated film. Although developed as a professional training tool, the film was publicly available on social media (ie, Twitter, YouTube) and gained increasing reach and visibility from being shared on such platforms. The reach of the film also grew as, anecdotally, the film had been used by other organisations for training purposes. At the time of the film's release, no public awareness campaigns on ACEs existed within the UK. It was therefore important to capture public interaction with, and response to, the film. Social media offers a novel research setting due to its low cost and widespread distribution of messages, 16 17 while providing a real-time function to determine reaction to public health messaging. 18 Understanding social media interaction can provide an indication of opinion towards the film, generating knowledge on how films can be used to support public health messaging and how information on ACEs can be effectively communicated. The past decade has witnessed increasing uptake in social media use. In 2019, an estimated 3.5 billion people worldwide actively used social media, a 9% increase from the previous year. 19 The social media site, Twitter, currently has 187 million daily active users worldwide. 20 The platform, where users can create and share user-based content-a 'tweet'of up to 280 characters or less, is a useful tool for the dissemination of information given its predominant focus on publicly available content. Because of its reach and diverse population of users, Twitter is increasingly used by researchers to interact with participants (eg, participant recruitment), disseminate research findings, generate impact and drive policy. 16 Furthermore, due to the volume of publicly available data, researchers have started to use data from the site for surveillance of topics/trends, content or sentiment analysis of tweets and to understand user engagement and network analysis. 21 Other social media platforms, including YouTube, are increasingly being recognised as a source for public health information, yet the content of such videos can contain misleading information. 22 Recent years have shown an increase in research using social media content to assess opinion on, and interaction with, public health research, policy and campaigns. [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] To add to the evidence base for films to support public health messaging, this study evaluated the short ACE animated film, including perceptions among professionals towards the film, as well as any associations between perceptions and personal experience of ACEs. Understanding how attitudes towards the film vary according to individuals' ACE exposure is important to ensure sensitivity of this approach of message conveyance to individuals with such experiences. Furthermore, public engagement with the film on social media (Twitter and YouTube platforms) was explored to understand Open access interaction with the film and further evaluate user sentiment towards it.",

The triangulation of findings across 239 survey participants, 358 Twitter interactions and 171 812 YouTube views indicate a perceived acceptability of, and positive reaction to the film. Positive attitudes to the film were indicated among professionals, with the film perceived to be easy to understand, useful and its length and amount of information contained 'just right'. Furthermore, over 9 in 10 respondents reported that they felt the film was credible. Despite half of the survey sample reporting the experience of negative emotions (ie, feeling sad or upset) from viewing the film, few reported that they found the film difficult or distressing to watch. Furthermore, analysis showed that a high proportion of those who reported feeling sad or upset, positively reflected that the film had left them feeling hopeful or encouraged, they had gained something positive from watching the film, had a better understanding of ACEs, felt more able to talk about them and would discuss them after viewing the film. Evoking sadness may, however, have improved the communication of the film's message. Public health messages which evoke high levels of emotion, or strong negative emotions (eg, sadness), have been shown to be subject to better recall. 32 33 The emotional tone of messaging has been found to be an important factor in an audience's perception of effectiveness and employing emotion including sadness in films is commonly used by advertising for charitable organisations. 34 Despite some participants indicating negative emotions, the film highlights an important subject matter and conveys it in a powerful way to positively impact professionals' understanding of ACEs, including how they can work with and support people affected by childhood adversity. Public viewer sentiment was also affirmative across both Twitter and YouTube interactions, with few tweets or YouTube comments being rated as having a negative sentiment and only 25 'Thumbs down' (less than 3% of all reactions recorded) received across the 13 published videos on YouTube.",

            "text": "To our knowledge, this is the first study to explore professional and public attitudes towards public health messaging on ACEs. To ensure sensitivity of the film to individuals who had experienced ACEs, we explored associations between professional perceptions of the film and self-reported ACE exposure. The majority of outcomes had no association with participant ACE count. A higher proportion of those reporting exposure to multiple ACEs in their childhood (ie, \u22654 ACEs) reported that they agreed that the film was difficult or distressing to watch, compared with those with no ACEs. However, a similar Open access trend was also identified with ACE exposure for agreeing that 'watching the film made me feel hopeful or encouraged'. Furthermore, when limited to those reporting personal ACE exposure, almost 9 in 10 survey participants agreed that people with ACEs would benefit from watching this film. This finding is important as it confirms the sensitivity of the film to those who have experienced childhood trauma, highlighting that for the majority, this method of communication was deemed acceptable. Other research has also identified that the experience of adversity can lead to increased empathy and compassion for others. 35 A positive attitude among professionals was also identified towards their future communication on ACEs. Over 9 in 10 respondents reported that they felt it was important that the issues in the film are talked about. The majority (96.2%) agreed that the film would benefit professionals who work with those affected by ACEs and over 8 in 10 (84.2%) reported that they would discuss ACEs after seeing the film. Research internationally into routinely enquiring about ACEs (predominantly termed screening in studies from the USA) within a range of health and other professional services is expanding. Evidence for such enquiry is currently limited and show mixed findings. 36 Studies in the UK within general practice and health visitor services have identified that routine ACE enquiry is acceptable to patients and professionals. 37 38 However, understanding of how enquiry can impact an individual's short-term and long-term health and wellbeing, parenting outcomes or how best to respond to individuals who disclose ACE exposure is not understood. 36 Improving knowledge and understanding of ACEs is increasingly being embedded within local and national policy. 8 9 In California, USA, the ACEs Aware Initiative set up by the California Surgeon General and the state Department of Health Care Services is partnering with organisations to ensure providers have the resources and training required to incorporate ACE awareness and ACE screening into child and adult patient healthcare (see https://www. acesaware. org/ about-aces-aware/ acesaware/). ACE-Aware Scotland aims to help all Scottish citizens better understand the impact of ACEs, with the objective to become the first ACE aware nation (https:// aceawarescotland. com/). The majority of participants in the survey sample here had viewed the film within continuing professional development. In Wales, the Welsh ACE Hub has delivered training on ACEs to police, youth justice and primary and secondary schools in order to bring about transformation change (see https://www. aceawarewales. com/ about). 10 Research measuring the Welsh public service workforce knowledge and awareness of ACEs (2253 respondents) identified a range of mediums as sources of ACE information-including videos (54%) and social media (31%). 10 Although data are not available on which video and social media individuals were referring to, with limited resource availability these wider health workforce figures may predominantly relate to the ACE film examined here. Such findings also highlight the growing trend for social media and online content as a source of public health knowledge and knowledge dissemination. 16 21 Social media is increasingly being used to explore attitudes towards public health messaging or interventions. Examples of the use of Twitter data in public health research include: understanding dental pain, 39 sentiment of posts on diabetes 40 and public attitudes towards: vaccination, 41 42 the introduction of minimum alcohol pricing, 30 alcohol guidelines, 27 mammography screening, 24 waterpipe smoking 43 as well as users' experience of loneliness, 44 mental health and suicidality. 45 Although the film evaluated here was not developed for health promotion like many of these examples, an understanding of interaction with it on social media presents an indication of wider reaction to the film. Findings from social media here, indicate notably little negative sentiment (1.4% of tweets captured) and no association between tweet interaction (ie, likes, comments and retweets) and sentiment. However, it should be noted for the interpretation of findings that Twitter offers users a 'like' function, but no direct function is available to enable a user to show that they do not like the content of a tweet. The findings of this study add to the evidence base for films to support public health messaging and the use of Twitter data to explore user interaction and sentiment. However, further research could explore attitudes towards the animated film with the wider public. Although only 0.6% of all 171 812 views of the film on YouTube provided a viewer reaction, where left, they were overwhelmingly positive (97.3%, 'thumbs up'). Further research with the public could explore these patterns in more detail given the ways in which the use of the film has organically grown since its launch to include use in training by other organisations and the subsequent publication of the film in other languages.",

The survey sample was small, with males and youth under-represented and it is not possible to identify any selective bias created by non-participation. Survey participants were professionals, predominantly working in health, social service or other public sectors and approximately 6 in 10 had viewed the film as part of continuing professional development (ie, training or conference attendance). The survey did not include any direct measure of participants' knowledge of ACEs prior to or after viewing the film, nor if they thought their practice would change as a result of viewing the film. As the survey was anonymous we were also unable to follow participants up to explore such changes. However, a high proportion of respondents reported feeling better able to talk about ACEs after viewing the film and that they would talk about ACEs if asked. We were also unable to explore if the film's evocation of sadness led to increased long-term memorability and recall, nor participants' views on the focus of film content. Future research should consider exploring the longer-term impacts of viewing ACE communication materials on recall and change in Open access practice, along with perceptions on the focus of such ACE communication. Here, we focused on perceptions towards the film, including examining perceptions by participant ACE count. ACEs were retrospectively self-reported and therefore, like other studies using an ACE methodology, our study may be affected by willingness to report and accurate recall. However, to minimise this, participants were asked to report their ACE count rather than their exposure to individual ACEs. Further, ACE prevalence identified in the sample was similar to that seen in UK population studies (here, 46.7% no ACEs, 8.9% \u22654 ACEs; England and Wales, 46.2% no ACEs, 10.3% \u22654 ACEs), 46 and findings indicate few associations between reported attitudes towards the film and ACE exposure.",

A moderate reach of the film with the public was identified on Twitter-with over 350 interactions-but the majority of the user profiles were UK based. Additional geographical spread in film use was identified through YouTube publication of additional film versions and in the examples of film use shared by the publisher. The standard Twitter search interface does not include all tweets, as the facility is only able to retrieve tweets from publicly available accounts. We included a large range of keywords incorporating acronyms (eg, 'ACEs') in structured searches to ensure the collection of all relevant tweets. Captured tweets related to a relatively small number of users, who are unlikely to be representative of professionals or the general population. Previous research has identified that Twitter users can appear in 'echo-chambers'-thus are surrounded and followed by accounts with similar views. 30 However, data from social media allow the examination of dynamic responses towards the film and also demonstrates its wider reach. Many Twitter accounts provided limited biographical information, thus limiting any further exploration of user profile and online film dissemination. We were also unable to verify if users whose tweets were captured here were expressing their own opinions and if the users who reacted to these tweets (ie, liked, retweeted or commented on them) had themselves viewed the animated film. Furthermore, analysis of online content can be difficult to interpret, for example sarcasm. 40 42 However, two reviewers assed all online content for sentiment analysis and levels of agreement between reviewers were consistently high (see Methods).",

Monitoring online responses to public health messaging can provide valuable feedback. 27 The findings identified here are of use to the development of policy and practice on ACEs in the UK and globally. The results indicate that the use of a short animated film to educate and communicate key messages on ACEs to professionals and the public may be acceptable and appropriate. Future research would provide valuable feedback to further explore the trends identified. Research should explore with larger and more generalisable samples of the public, attitudes towards and use of this film to convey education to a broad audience on ACEs. Future research could also include feedback from participants on alternative methods for communicating public health messages on ACEs, which unfortunately was not able to be addressed within this study. This would add to the growing evidence base on understanding of ACEs, their communication, enquiry and how those who have experienced or are experiencing ACEs can be provided with appropriate support.",

Evidence suggests some providers are unaware of ACEs and lack training on how to support and work with those exposed to them. 36 Increasing ACE awareness can further enable services to operate in an ACE-informed way-one which is compassionate to users and ensures staff have the confidence, skills and knowledge to identify ACEs and signpost those who are or have experienced them to appropriate support. Internationally, major movements now exist to increase ACE awareness and embed such change in policy. Materials which are developed for the purpose of increasing ACE awareness, even if specifically designed for professional training, are likely to become accessible within the public domain. As such, it is therefore important to understand attitudes towards these materials across a range of individuals including the general public. The public and professional response, as identified here, offers a starting point for the future development of the literature to inform both professional and individual understanding. International examples of the films use were found, with requests for translation into Lithuanian and Dutch and a New Zealand accent, with its use across a variety of audiences. These examples demonstrate how material developed for one setting can be adapted for use more broadly. Continuing to explore attitudes towards such resources is essential as more areas seek to drive local, regional and national change towards the prevention of ACEs and mitigation of their associated negative life outcomes.",
