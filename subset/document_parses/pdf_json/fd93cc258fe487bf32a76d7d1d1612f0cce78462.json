Patients were severely ill with multiorgan involvement, unlike any other COVID-19 cases observed at that time [7] . The Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health (RCPCH) was among the first medical organizations to acknowledge this condition and coined the term pediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome temporally associated with SARS-CoV-2 (PIMS-TS) [8] . The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), followed by the World Health Organization (WHO), labeled this condition multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) [9, 10] .

A study conducted in India found that a PELOD-2 score of 0-4 correlated with a 1.6% mortality rate, 5-9 correlated with a 14.8% mortality rate and 10-14 correlated with a 50% mortality rate [27] . In our study, of the two patients who passed away, Patient 1 had a PELOD-2 score of 6 and Patient 9 had a PELOD-2 score of 9. However, this finding needs to be interpreted with caution as every single patient comes with varying onset and severity of diseases. Also, PELOD-2 is measured after initial life-saving treatments have been administered, which explains the lower scores in our studies compared to other studies. Serial measurements of PELOD-2 score may be a better way to assess their prognosis. Therefore, the low median PELOD-2 score may explain the lower mortality rate in our study.",

In our series, 3 out of 13 patients had severe neurological symptoms as part of their MIS-C presentation. In addition, one patient had an existing neurological disorder (cerebral palsy) but developed no additional neurological signs and symptoms. A case series reported neurological manifestations in 365/1965 COVID-19 patients <21 years old. Of these, 43 had severe neurologic involvement, including 20 patients who met the criteria for MIS-C [29] . Guillain-Barr e syndrome and its variants occurring in association with COVID-19 have been increasingly reported and may occur both during and after active infection [30, 31] . Patient 10 had a clinical, laboratory and neurophysiologic features consistent with the acute motor axonal neuropathy (AMAN) variant of GBS. In a systematic review of case reports, AMAN was the least reported variant of GBS, occurring in 8 out of 77 cases [30] . To date, there are only two reports of pediatric optic neuritis associated with COVID-19, one occurring during active infection and one as the presenting symptom of MIS-C in a PCR-negative, seropositive child [32, 33] . Patient 13 presented with acute vision impairment and neurophysiologic evidence of optic nerve demyelination in the face of a negative PCR and positive IgG. In both our patients with demyelinating disease, corticosteroid treatment yielded a good outcome. Acute encephalopathy is the most frequently reported severe neurological manifestation of COVID-19 and MIS-C [29] . However, in our small case series, only one patient had this presentation, which may have been secondary to hypovolemic shock.",
