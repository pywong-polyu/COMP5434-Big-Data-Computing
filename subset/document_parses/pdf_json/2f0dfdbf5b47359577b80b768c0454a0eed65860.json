Even worse, some assume the sheer volume provides greater objectivity, neutrality and accuracy, but \"data are always the result of conscious, subjective decisions on the part of researchers, and are the result of inherently social processes\" [1] . The perceived authority or effectiveness is lost by being overwhelmed by all the automatically-collected data, by mistaking omniscience for omnipotence or intelligence: \"the more you know about the secret lives of others, the less powerful you turn out to be!\" [2] . \u2022 False precision: digital geographical coordinates are often given to some arbitrary precision based on a data storage decision (eg: single vs double precision), rather than the accuracy of the recording method, giving incorrect perceptions of coordinate accuracy. For example, a point geocoded from a toponym (eg: Tshwane) could have a precision of a second (about 30 m), though the toponym encompasses many square kilometres. False precision also applies to other types of data. \u2022 Quality: many factors can inhibit the quality of data, but these are often not well understood by the end users. \u2022 Metadata: documenting data, their quality and characteristics are essential for being able to use the data meaningfully, but metadata is often not well understood by the end users and is often not provided adequately.",

While this can be ameliorated through other data, local knowledge and insights, and careful statistical analysis, it is of particular concern when those using the data are blissfully unaware of the bias. Bias also occurs in training sets for models, such as in machine learning.

Men born to freedom are naturally alert to repel invasion of their liberty by evil-minded rulers. The greatest dangers to liberty lurk in insidious encroachment by men of zeal, well-meaning but without understanding\" [14] .",

There is clearly much research that still needs to be done on these issues, particularly given the different perspectives on vales and ethics due to culture, religion, politics, experiences, age, gender, social status and so on.",
