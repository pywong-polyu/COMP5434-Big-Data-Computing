Medical experts from various countries have conducted relevant researches in their own fields and countries, and the development of an effective vaccine has been expected soon. Although some progress has been made in the development of therapeutic drugs and vaccines, interdisciplinary and cooperative studies are scarce. However, it is easy to form information islands and conduct repeated scientific research. To date, no therapeutic drug or vaccine for COVID-19 has been officially approved yet for marketing. In this article, the features of experts in cooperation networks, such as graph structure, context attribute, sequential co-occurrence probability, weight features and auxiliary features, are comprehensively analyzed. Based on this, a novel graph neural network + long short-term memory + generative adversarial network (GNN + LSTM + GAN) expert recommendation model based on link prediction is constructed to encourage cooperation among relevant experts in research social networks. Finding experts in related fields, establishing cooperative relations with them and achieving multinational and cross-field expert cooperation are significant to promote the development of therapeutic drugs and vaccines.",

During the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, the research sought experts with similar research directions or research interests from various countries or collaborators with relevant research experience on COVID-19 to help them establish connection with potential collaborators. This project adopts the theories and methods commonly used in many disciplines, such as computer science and physics. Based on complex networks, recommendation systems, and data-mining related theories, the graph neural network (GNN) + long short-term memory (LSTM) + generative adversarial network (GAN) expert recommendation model based on link prediction was constructed using the deep learning technology. The expert recommendation model learns the features of the experts to form the author's low-dimensional, dense, and semantic vector representation. Thus, the probability of establishing connection between experts can be calculated to establish an efficient cooperative relationship. The main contributions of this article are as follows:",

In recent years, some scholars at home and abroad have used recommendation systems based on link prediction to the research social networks. Wang et al. (2015) analyzed the expert information and network topology information in the research social networks to construct a link prediction model, made relevant expert recommendations for the users in the research social networks, and confirmed the effectiveness of the algorithm in the research social network ScholarMate. Liu et al. (2014) recommended scholars with potential cooperative relationships using a random walk model based on co-authorship. They yielded good results in terms of the accuracy rate, coverage rate, and recall rate. Victor et al. (2012) employed the link prediction method to analyze the relationships between scholars within the research institution as well as their relationships with external scholars. Moreover, they constructed a multi-academic social model which they applied in the online research community in Brazil. They were able to achieve a good group recommendation effect. Xia et al. (2014) proposed a random walk with restart academic friend recommendation algorithm MVCWlaker. This method first conducts a weighted analysis of the edges in the academic cooperation network. Considering the cooperation order, latest cooperation time, and number of cooperation, they reasonably weight the edges in the social cooperation network and obtain a weighted academic cooperation network, which runs a random walk algorithm to achieve node similarity. Kong et al. (2016) suggested that scholars' research interests should be considered in the recommendation of academic collaborators. They also revealed that the relevance of scholars' research interests has a significant impact on academic cooperation. Based on this, they proposed an academic collaborator recommendation algorithm, combining the research content and academic networks. Through the list of scholars' papers and using the topic model, scholars' research topics can be obtained, which can improve the random walk algorithm, and accurate author recommendation results can be achieved. Vasuki et al. (2010) extended community recommended to contact recommended, considering the user's friend relationship and contact network. They also used the algorithm based on the graph proximity model (GPM) and that based on the latent factor model to generate community recommendation for the users. The experimental results revealed that the algorithm based on the GPM was more effective'.",

The existing heuristic algorithms can be classified according to the number of hops that need to pass through the neighbors to calculate the score. For example, common neighbors (CN) and preferential attachment (PA) are first-order heuristics, as two target nodes only involve onehop neighbors. The Adamic/Adar index and resource allocation are second-order heuristics as they involve neighbors up to two hops.

To encode the structural information of the graph, each node can be represented by a low-dimensional state vector. Moreover, it can be applied not only in the field of link prediction but also in knowledge graph completion and recommendation systems. \u2022 PropFlow PropFlow (Thi et al. 2014) calculates the information between nodes through a local path to evaluate the relationship between two nodes.
