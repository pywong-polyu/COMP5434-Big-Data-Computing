We retrospectively examined the time course of anti-SARS-CoV-2 Ig antibody levels after up to five repeated vaccinations in 644 previously nonresponding kidney transplant recipients. Using anti SARS-CoV-2 IgG/IgA ELISA and the total Ig ECLIA assays, we compare antibody levels at 1 month with levels at 2 and 4 months, respectively. Additionally, we correlate the measurements of the used assays. Between 1 and 2 months, and between 1 and 4 months, mean anti-SARS-CoV-2 Ig levels in responders decreased by 14% and 25%, respectively, depending on the assay. Absolute Ig values and time course of antibody levels and showed high interindividual variability. Ig levels decreased by at least 20% in 77 of 148 paired samples with loss of sufficient serological protection over time occurring in 18 out of 148 (12.2%). IgG ELISA and total Ig ECLIA assays showed a strong positive correlation (Kendall's tau=0.78), yet the two assays determined divergent results in 99 of 751 (13.2%) measurements. IgG and IgA assays showed overall strong correlation but divergent results in 270 of 1.173 (23.0%) cases and only weak correlation of antibody levels in positive samples. Large interindividual variability and significant loss of serological protection after 4 months supports repeated serological sampling and consideration of shorter vaccination intervals in kidney transplant recipients.",

The result is a lack of protection against COVID-19 in KTR as compared with healthy individuals (11, 12) . A third vaccination was recommended early on for KTR in order to increase immune response (13) . Further, repeated vaccinations under modulated immunosuppression effectively increase protection, yet a substantial number of patients does not reach protective antibody levels (14, 15) .",

Loss of antibodies at 2 months and 4 months after vaccination occurred in a substantial number of initially responding individuals, presumably resulting in a loss of protection against COVID-19. While it is known that patient receiving MPA have a low vaccination response rate (14, 17) , our results suggest that use of MPA is also associated with a delay in vaccination response resulting in increasing Ig levels over time in almost 18% of patients. Most importantly, we noted a high variability in the development of humoral protection over time between KTR. These results support the monitoring of antibody levels and, if required, shorter vaccination intervals in KTR compared with healthy individuals.",

Although we cannot determine any clear cut-off values, loss of protection against Delta and Omicron variants will be more severe as these variants have been shown to require a higher level of humoral response for protection.
