            "text": "historically-situated concept of a good death and a bad death and suggests why dying alone, whether completely alone or without significant others physically present, may be considered a bad death. Methods: As evidence for collective fears about dying alone, we explored the treatment of these deaths in media using headline examples from the US New York Times and the English Guardian newspaper from the 19th century through Sept. 2020. Results: A search of the New York Times located 39 articles with either lonely dying or lonely death in the headline. The Guardian had 25 articles with use of the term, but unlike the New York Times, no obituaries were included. Although the deaths profiled were deemed unusual, deaths by suicide were only minimally classed as dying alone. The condition of dying alone is represented as a stigmatised death. Themes addressed: 1) dying alone is a nonnormative event; 2) this death matters; and 3) where people die alone, societies should honour the death and learn from it. Discussion and implications: Contemporary dying involves conditions for which we are unprepared as a society. We seldom address our civic obligations to each other. Few people have discussed their wishes about their preferences in dying and whether and how they want to be accompanied at their death, if possible. This is an invisible constraint of modern healthcare. Because of limited discussions and preparation, these deaths may lead to disenfranchised grief for the mourners. Cultural and societal responses to lonely dying are important in easing the emotional burden of dying alone, helping individuals prepare for this possibility and better integrating death with the life course. Recommendations include inclusion of accompaniment/nonaccompaniment at death as part of advance care planning and mitigation if this condition occurs. It is essential for individuals to find their own still point of acceptance within competing societal narratives of privileging the self in dying alone and the value of social connection.",

The term dying alone describes approaching death while living alone or dying in a place where significant others are unable to be near. The presence of strangers such as health care workers at the death may not mitigate the loneliness of the experience, though for some it could. An accompanied-but-lonely death may still unfold when the right person, one with whom one has a close relationship and feels understood by, even without words, is not available or may have already died herself/himself. Dying alone does not mean one has limited social connections (is socially isolated) nor that one prefers to stay at home (is reclusive or socially withdrawn). Furthermore, it does not mean one feels alone (or is lonely). Rather it means that one chooses to experience death alone, or that one cannot be accompanied at death for other reasons by those with whom the individual feels close. This may parallel how that individual has lived a more solitary life or it may be quite different, having had a life full of family, colleagues and friends. Dying alone does not mean one has had a lonely life (Kellehear, 2009) just as, in life, living alone does not infer a lonely life.",

If people attend the death, they may not be the ones the dying person would prefer. Dying alone is a fear that many people hold (Frommer, 2016) and thus they prefer to be accompanied at their death, even if it is only to be sung into their next life or that great vast void which they may imagine will be the next step. Family and friends who share significant relationships, if they speak of death at all, may express that one of their worst fears would be if a loved one died alone (Larrson, Ramgard, & Bolmsjo, 2017) . In part the gravity of these perceptions of lone dying is because of sense of guilt at failing to fill a social or personally desired role. In part, these may reflect genuine concern that the beloved relative or friend may feel terror or fear in dying alone.",

            "text": "\"Healthy\" social goals also disparage dying alone through media representations as explained below. There is little empirical literature on dying alone and none published on the empirical history of dying alone in the UK and the United States. One of the best-known historians of attitudes towards death and mourning, Aries (1981) , envisioned death as a communal or societal-level affair in pre-contemporary times. His idea of the tamed death in Europe was one that was familiar, close and softened. The individual and society had an expected relationship with death, held together through the nature of the community fabric and structure. Death lived alongside life. This was taught through paintings of death anthropomorphized, sneaking up on a man or woman at work or busy with domestic duties. There were also stereotypical deathbed scenes where the dying person was surrounded by people, giving usually his (rather than her) last blessings or advice. Sometimes the deathbed scene was peaceful, perhaps even including a heavenly light shining down on the dying. Other scenes were more gruesome, showing the sorrowful sighs of a sinner at his death, encouraging those present not to follow his bad example. The ars moriendi was a set of Christian rules; the brief written manual and visual depictions of death through the arts provided guidance for dying and meeting expectations of both the divine and the church (Thornton & Phillips, 2009 ). Death could be controlled and measured. These were teaching tales about living a moral life aligned with religious values where truth-telling was not the aim. Dying alone did not form part of this collective vocabulary. Elias (2001) criticised Ari\u00e8s for failing to recognise the banality with which many people died in those early historical periods. For instance, in the mid-14th century, roughly 75-200 million people in Eurasia may have died due to nation-wide plagues. Poor harvests led to scarce bread, so people starved and had little resistance to disease unless they had natural immunity. Rather than death giving a chance for good-byes, death was often quick, but painful. These would be known today as bad deaths, deaths with limited medication other than occasional herbs to counteract pain and not even the tincture of time to say good-bye (Sweet, 2012) . Because the causes of death were not well-known and dying was often a lone affair, death was equated with fear and fear was intensified.",

The Buddhists teach that it is helpful when people meditate on their own dying to imagine themselves letting go in the case of being murdered (Sogyal, Gaffney, & Harvey, 1995) .

In some forms of Buddhism, for instance, though one may be present at the dying, that person should not be touched. The concern with touching is that person's consciousness will be brought back into the room during the period that he/she is seeking to release all attachments to the current life. One manifestation of death preparation is simply the completion of advance directives after advance care planning.",

Relatives found comfort in deaths during the great world wars if they later learned a buddy had been present.

            "text": "An even more striking situation was that of Joyce Carol Vincent, featured in the 2006 UK newspaper, The Sun, with a headline as Woman Dead in Flat For 3 Years. This became a film, Dreams of a life in 2011 (The Guardian, 2011, October 09) that more fully explored the traces of Vincent's social interactions to try to answer the question of why she had died alone. A 38-year-old Caribbean woman who by accounts had friendships, beauty, and talent, for some reason withdrew from most of these and may not have been sought after she disappeared, though she was living in view. This may represent an extreme form of disengagement theory, though this theory, now out of favour, was generally applied to older people. She had been dead in her flat for nearly three years with the TV still tuned to BBC when she was found due to accumulated unpaid rent. Will we see more of this social withdrawal with attendant consequences of dying alone after the imposed isolation of the pandemic? Japanese has a word for lonely dying where people have been found months after their death: kodokushi (NYT, 2012 April 9). Similar to the Guardian report of people found dead, use of the term first reached national awareness in 2000 when a 69-year-old man was discovered dead after three years. The term has come to signify increasing social isolation of older people, especially where many reside in cities and fewer in multigenerational households (NYT, 2017 Nov 30) .",

Some individuals who live alone will likely die alone if they experience a sudden death, and that thought is uncomfortable. A further concern is that these individuals were not missed. Their deaths were overlooked because they didn't seem to matter to those who lived their lives in proximity.

            "text": "The first searchable use of the term lonely dying was a 1935 obituary that makes special note of a female doctor who died alone. Although it's unclear whether it was dying of a heart attack, living alone in a log cabin, or a telephone operator asking a nearby business to assist that was noteworthy, it seemed to be remarkable for the time. In some cases, deaths of women seemed to be reported but obscured. In order to learn the name of one female singer dying alone described as a former banker's wife, Gladys Lanphere Benjamin, one must read the entire article text. (See Table 1 for a complete list of New York Times articles with these search terms.) A later 1936 obituary tries to make sense of a French sculptor who died alone and puzzlingly left bequests though he died penniless. An Arkansas senate majority leader Joseph T. Robinson who ignored heart attack symptoms was found dead alone. The first line of this obit seems to cast blame for his failure to heed these warning symptoms. A 1939 obituary of a single bachelor, lists one Earl Willson Bemis, who died age 72, found deceased in his apartment. He was a naturalist, who had donated $200,000 to Harvard University six years previously. This would have been someone who deserved public recognition for his generosity, and who we would expect to be mourned because of his bequest. The general tone of these individual obituary chronicles seems to be that dying alone is the death no one wants. A further set of articles on lonely dying discusses news stories, policy, and opinions related to deaths of troops, an anthropomorphised death of a much-loved towering redwood tree, vulnerable groups, and the beginning of deaths during the 2020 pandemic. Other uses of lonely dying include mention in book titles and films.",

Although death by suicide is a form of dying alone, that is not often reported under the term dying alone, though it might be the ultimate existential lonely death. A possible reason for this is that successful suicide carries a different form of emotional weight and a hint of societal stigma through this choice. The concept of selection of suicide overpowers merely dying alone, a term that suggests less personal choice, though some choice may feature in both conditions. A 1971 NYT article reported the death of June Nector, titled A Lonely Death Closes A Woman's Lonely Life. \"Miss Nector had lived in rooming house, and because she did not invite friendships, she had no friends. She had no visitors, and she received no mail, either (para 4).\" The physician attending her death commented, \"The main problem was that she was old. I see a lot of them like that (para 3).\" She was supported in her last ten days of life by community workers from a local self-help group who brought her food and summoned an ambulance (NYT, 1971, November 7). The earliest article regarding a lonely death was from 1880 regarding the mother of an Oregon senator. This term also surfaced a brief article from 1897 on Freda Susan Leach, a woman age 65 who died in a NY lodging house where she was an occasional guest. It was thought she \"belonged somewhere in Pennsylvania.\" Between 1880 and 1901 there were 9 articles about lonely deaths, several relating to roles of the decedent, such as physician, priest, and miser (two articles re the latter). We may assume that the attribute miser was not self-selected like the other two roles. These deaths had hallmarks of being unusual and curious circumstances or sad losses for the community. The Lonely Death of George Bell, discussed in detail in a previous section, was found under the term lonely death.",

If you lived well and contributed to society, you deserved a good death, and dying alone was undeserved.

            "text": "The aftermath of lonely deaths may lead to disenfranchised grief in surviving family and friends. Disenfranchised grief suggests that individuals may experience very strong grief reactions that resist social validation (Doka, 1989; Harris & Winokuer, 2016) . The person who is grieving, including the person dying who anticipates his/her own death and significant others who anticipate a loss, may not be able to engage in common mourning rituals designed to alleviate the burden of grief. During the pandemic disenfranchised grief may be more prevalent or talked about because of the loss of familiar rituals, such as participating in a funeral. The contingent of allowable public mourners have included immediate family only, leaving out grandchildren who may deeply experience the exclusion. Further if the loss involved a person whose relationship with the decedent could not be disclosed or was unrecognised, for instance, a best friend, co-worker, or secret partner, this too may remain unhealed. Disenfranchised grief acknowledges the social rules around who and what is valued, who or what should be grieved, how grieving should ensue. It can further entrench perceived social isolation where grief is unacknowledged. Disenfranchised grief takes into account social networks, individual perceptions and selfperceptions, the political environment, and interactions among them. Some forms of loneliness or aloneness might be chosen by individuals who may not be fully permitted to make this choice when it is not one approved by their social network or wider society. Examples of this lack of social permission include when dying individuals are Lonely, broke and dead at 42: the fall of the no win, no fee tycoon.

Interestingly, the earliest 1880 NYT article detailing a lonely death reported the key interest of this senator's mother was to live and die alone; she achieved her wish. She was noted to be peculiar in this wish, but she was clearly much respected. It is important for professionals and others to recognise that although individuals may value connection, at times they may prefer time alone, are not lonely, and instead grow through the experience of solitude. By contrast, in the time of the pandemic, many people are dying alone without choice. Their loved ones may not be permitted to be present because of substantial health risks for all. Since there was no time to prepare for this type of death, there are additional possible traumatic and shock elements, the latter similar to the first stage of K\u00fcbler-Ross's five stages of grieving/dying (K\u00fcbler-Ross, 1969) .

Eventually this led to confinement in bed, blindness, and limited ability to speak. This inherited trait and illness had affected many of the women in the family, and her older sister had died from it at age 16 as well as several aunts and great-aunts. The sister had died alone in a nursing care home, found by her mom. This client's own worst fear at her then-age of 21 was being alone at her death. By contrast a hospice research participant who had a career as a former Veteran's Administration psychologist expressed a different view.

These conversations may be initiated by a GP or physician, but more commonly are conducted by a nurse, social worker, or sometimes a chaplain, often together with other family members. These may be standard on any hospital admission but are especially important when an individual has a severe life-limiting illness. The focus is on what actions the person would desire if their health were severely compromised and they could no longer voice their wishes. Commonly the forms ask individuals to consider who they would want as a primary decision maker if they were not longer able to make their own decisions, whether they would want life-sustaining treatment, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, and organ donation.",
