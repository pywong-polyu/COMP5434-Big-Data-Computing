SARS-CoV-2 is the 7th coronavirus that could pro-duce human infection, with the previous six species including 229E, NL63, OC43, HKU1, Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus and severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (SARS-CoV) [3] . A recently published article showed that SARS-CoV-2 has a 79.5% identity with SARS-CoV and 96% with a bat coronavirus [1] . The clinical manifestations of COVID-19 are very similar to SARS [2] , ranging from mild flu-like symptoms to severe pneumonia. Vertical transmission is a common transmission routine for some contagious disease, by which the pathogens passed from mother to the child across the placenta, through direct contact during delivery, or in the breast milk. Some coronavirus, such as 229E, OC43, NL63, and HKU1, are common respiratory viruses, which have proven to be characteristic of vertical transmission [4] . However, based on the limited evidence, the vertical transmission of SARS-CoV and middle east respiratory syndromerelated coronavirus is still not confirmed [5] [6] [7] [8] . On Feb 5, 2020, a neonatal patient with COVID-19, born to a mother with laboratoryconfirmed COVID-19, was diagnosed based on a positive nucleic acid test from the oropharyngeal swab 30 h after birth. It raises concerns among obstetricians, neonatologists, and public health agencies about the possibility of mother-to-child transmission of this novel coronavirus.

The similar results were presented on another subsequent study, which sent the amniotic fluid, cord blood, neonatal throat swab, and breastmilk samples from 6 pregnant women with COVID-19 for nucleic acid test and all samples tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 [11] . In our case, amniotic fluid, vaginal secretions, placenta, cord blood, breast milk, venous blood from mother, and the throat and anal swab, sputum, venous blood, urine samples from the newborn were all tested negative for SARS-CoV-2, which is consistent with the published studies. These existing pieces of evidence are predictive of low risk of motherto-child transmission for SARS-CoV-2. To our knowledge, this is by far the most comprehensive tested case in the world, providing the most convincing evidence to the question of whether there is a mother-to-child vertical transmission of this novel coronavirus. However, the possibility of viral load influencing the transmission risk should be of concern. Published studies have demonstrated a positive relationship between the viral load of some viruses and their ability to spread from mother to child [12, 13] ; it is still unclear whether SARS-CoV-2 has similar characteristics. In this case, we cannot estimate the mother's highest viral load before delivery, because she received the initial test on 6d of symptom onset, already after viral load reached the peak at 3 to 5d [14] [15] [16] .
