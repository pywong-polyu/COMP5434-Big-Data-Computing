The dot blot is a competitive assay wherein higher the neutralizing activity results in lower blot color formation. The dot blot stain color intensity was captured and quantitated using ImageJ software analysis. Figure 3 below, a comparison of the two methods shows similar neutralizing activity by the two assays. Using a concentration curve, we were able to determine that the anti-RBD IgY inhibited the binding of RBD to ACE2 similarly with IC50 of inhibition being 0.2 mg/ml in the ELISA assay and 0.1 mg/ml in the dot blot assay. The delta strain of SarsCov2 virus has emerged as the dominant strain in the world currently and is found in 80% of the people infected globally (12) . The delta variant RBD is mutated with three amino acid changes from the native RBD. These mutations make this variant more transmissible and infective. We tested whether the IgY antibody raised as above will a) bind to delta RBD and b) neutralize the binding of delta RBD to ACE2 using ELISA and dot blot assays respectively.

Since the IgY neutralize the binding of RBD to ACE2, it is expected that there will be reduction in viral entry into the cells. Table 1 below shows that at two concentrations tested, IgY was able to reduce plaque formation effectively suggesting their effectiveness in reducing virus binding and entry into vero cells . We have developed chicken IgY against SarsCoV2 RBD with the intention of using these antibodies to neutralize the interaction of the virus with human cell ACE2 receptors. The chickens were immunized with RBD and the IgY were harvested from the eggs. Because the IgY are derived from eggs, they are considered to be GRAS and are permitted by regulators as ingestible. This allows the IgY to be used as an oral rinse and a drink to negate the entry of virus from the oropharyngeal region and the digestive tract in humans.",

The IgY neutralize the binding of RBD of both native and delta variant to ACE2, which is a significant advantage since delta variant is currently the most prevalent in the world currently (12) . In addition, there have been reports of neutralizing antibodies against native virus strain have reduced neutralizing activity against the delta variant (13). It's likely that the polyclonal nature of our IgY allows it to be a broad-spectrum antibody with ability to neutralize both the native and delta RBD. Our goal is to further develop this IgY as a prophylactic oral rinse/drink product for use by children, elderly who are not vaccinated, individuals who are constantly exposed to the virus such as in hospitals or those who work in crowded places. The preparation and characterization of IgY as presented here forms the basis for development work towards this goal.",
