These measures were aimed at avoiding close physical proximity between people. The adverse economic consequences of this lockdown policy became immediately apparent, with almost two million workers, or more than every third worker in Switzerland, being put on short-time work within only 6 weeks after the policy's implementation. In an attempt to promptly assess the heterogeneous consequences of this lockdown policy, we computed a lockdown index. This index is based on an occupation's dependence on physical proximity to other people and corrected for certain essential sectors being exempt from this policy. We find that on average, 31% of jobs in Switzerland have been potentially restricted by the lockdown policy. This average masks considerable heterogeneity along many dimensions, with the strongest effects for the large industries hospitality, construction, and arts and entertainment. With respect to the regional variation, we find the strongest effects for the cantons of Obwalden, Uri, Appenzell Innerrhoden, and Valais. Moreover, low-and middle-income individuals are considerably more restricted than high-income ones. We do not find meaningful differences between men and women or urban and rural areas. Finally, we test the explanatory power of the lockdown index for short-time work and unemployment increases by canton and industry until the end of April 2020 and find that it can explain up to 58% of these short-term employment outcomes.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "The fast spread of the coronavirus has caused economic crises all around the globe. In Switzerland, the first patient with COVID-19 was detected on February 25, 2020. The 70 year-old man from the canton Ticino had visited the heavily affected North of Italy before. In the following weeks, the virus quickly spread around the country, such that in the early stages of the pandemic, Switzerland was among the countries with the highest prevalence of positive COVID-19 cases in Europe 1 . Despite the comparatively high prevalence of positive cases in the first half of March, Switzerland initially adopted only relatively mild measures, such as contact tracing via phone calls or the prohibition of events with more than 1000 participants, to contain the spread of the virus. On March 13, however, the Swiss government started to take more drastic steps and decided to close down all educational institutions as well as to prohibit gatherings with more than 100 people. Only a few days later, on March 16, the government announced the so-called \"extraordinary situation, \" which entailed even stricter measures. These measures included the closures of shops, restaurants and bars, entertainment and leisure facilities, as well as the prohibition of all public and private events. In addition, the government called on the public to avoid all unnecessary contact, keep distance from others, (2020) 156:11 Page 2 of 23 Switzerland, 2004 Switzerland, -2020 and to follow the recommended hygiene measures. A few essential industries, such as food stores, the health care sector, and the repair of transport vehicles were explicitly exempt from these measures 2 . This lockdown policy was quickly followed by a sharp rise in the numbers of people registered for short-time work (\"Kurzarbeit\" in German, \"furlough pay\" in the UK) and those filing for unemployment insurance as shown in Fig. 1 3 . The spike in the number of employees on shorttime work in March and April 2020 is unprecedented and dwarfs even the strong increase following the Great Recession of 2007. Overall, about 1.9 million Swiss workers were registered for short-time work by the end of April 2020. This corresponds to more than every third worker in Switzerland being put on short-time work. Compared to this, the increase in unemployment had been much smaller with an increase of about 46,000 workers by the end of April 2020 compared to the year before.

For example, a choreographer (i.e., the occupation with the highest need for physical proximity in the data) is coded to be restricted by the coronavirus, whereas a fine artist (among the lowest need for physical proximity) is coded to be unrestricted by it. On top of this occupationbased assignment, we account for essential industries that were exempt from the government's measures by coding workers in these industries as unrestricted.

There is a fast expanding literature analyzing the economic impact of the coronavirus. Similar attempts were made to explain the heterogeneous effect of the coronavirus based on the distribution of occupational characteristics. Dingel and Neiman (2020) used a home-office index to study the effect for the USA. This approach was then applied to other countries (e.g., Alipour et al. (2020) for Germany, Redmond and McGuinness (2020) for Ireland). Instead, our lockdown index relies on an occupation's need for physical proximity instead of the ability to perform the job from home, which we find more suitable, at least in the Swiss setting 5 .

For this reason, cantons housing headquarters of large companies that operate throughout several cantons (e.g., Basel-Stadt) may receive more pre-registrations than will eventually be paid out there.

Such potential double counts will only be corrected once compensations will be paid out. Second, up until April 28, 2020, almost all pre-registrations had been approved in an urgent procedure. It is possible that a considerable share of these pre-registration may eventually either not be claimed or paid out for other reasons. These reported numbers may therefore be interpreted as an upper bound of the shorttime work compensations that will eventually be paid out.

To assess the heterogeneous impact of the coronavirus lockdown on the Swiss labor force, we explore the heterogeneity of the lockdown index by income group, age, gender, and civil status. Figure 7 presents the lockdown index for ten income groups. Income is defined as annual gross income of workers without a side job. Again, there is substantial heterogeneity, with the share of workers that are restricted by the lockdown ranging from 18 to 36%. In particular, low-and middle-income individuals (less than CHF 91,000) are strongly affected with values ranging from 32 to 36%. In contrast, high-income individuals (more than CHF 91,000) are the least affected, with the lowest index for the highest income group. This is plausible, given that many low-income service occupations such as waitresses/waiters or construction workers rely on physical proximity to do their job and that high-income jobs such as managers, software developers, or lawyers entail mostly abstract tasks that may be performed with close proximity to other people. In Fig. 8 , we present the lockdown index for eleven age groups. The different age groups have astonishingly similar index values with the exception of 20-24 year olds, who are substantially more restricted by the lockdown. This is explained by this group's especially high concentration in side jobs in restaurants, bars or the retail sector. Figure 9 presents the lockdown index by gender and civil status. On average, women are slightly less restricted by the coronavirus lockdown than men, though not to a large extent. For both genders, single people are somewhat more affected than married ones or those in a civil union. We conjecture that this is due to both the lower average age of single people and children in the household, which tend to incentivize people to sort into jobs that can be performed from home.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 219, "end": 227, "text": "Figure 7", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1074, "end": 1080, "text": "Fig. 8", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1415, "end": 1423, "text": "Figure 9", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Fig. 3 Lockdown index by canton"}, {"text": "In this subsection, we study the explanatory power of the lockdown index for the short-run labor market outcomes during the lockdown measures.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Explanatory power for employment changes during lockdown"}, {"text": "The Swiss labor market. Historically, the unemployment rate in Switzerland has been relatively low, ranging between 1.7 and 3.9% since 2000, with an average of 3.0%. Compared to other European countries, Switzerland has a highly flexible labor market with comparatively short notice periods for the cancelation of work contracts. In general, firms have two main margins of adjustment when they want to or have to reduce labor costs. First, they may lay off workers, who will then, after the notice period has elapsed and if they were unable to find a new job in the meantime, file for unemployment insurance at the regional employment center. Notice periods vary by tenure, with 1 month for workers in their first year of employment, 2 months for those in the second to ninth year, and 3 months for workers with higher tenure at this employer. Unemployment appears in our data after employment is actually terminated. Second, employers may file for short-time work compensation of certain employees if they face temporary drops in production due to external factors. If on shorttime work, the employee remains employed, but at a reduced workload, which may be as low as 0%. As compensation for the reduction in workload, the employee receives a subsidy of 80% of her foregone salary. Shorttime work compensation is paid out during a maximum of 12 months over a 2-year period. Short-time work requests pass three stages: employers have to pre-register for short-time work compensation, pre-registration then gets approved or rejected, and finally, short-time work compensation is paid out to employers 15 .", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Explanatory power for employment changes during lockdown"}, {"text": "Explaining the rise in short-time work.

During the Great Recession of 2007, the approval rate of short-time work pre-registrations varied between 55 and 100% across cantons (Kopp and Siegenthaler 2019) .

The experience from close neighbors has likely caused stricter enforcement of the lockdown and a stronger response of firms. Third, the SLFS data does not include crossborder commuters.

Despite this historically large increase in unemployment, this remains is a relatively small response compared to the additional 1.9 million individuals in short-time work. Reasons for this may be that firms rely more on shorttime work instead of laying off workers to save labor costs, but also that laid-off workers may still be employed due the notice periods of several months for the cancelation of work contracts. Because of the latter, it is likely that a large part of the increase in unemployment in these first 2 months after the start of the coronavirus crisis is attributable to fewer job openings rather than more layoffs.
