Households have encountered pandemicrelated economic contraction, job losses, supply chain disruptions, and rising food costs [1] . In April 2020, 24% of Canadian adults indicated fair or poor mental health [2] . In comparison, only 8% of Canadians reported fair or poor mental health in the 2018 Canadian Community Health Survey. Pandemic-related fears about health for oneself and loved ones, prolonged social isolation, and feelings of uncertainty were common sources of distress. One source of distress during this time may be worry about the ability to afford food, especially as food insecurity has increased. A May 2020 survey found pandemic-era prevalence of food insecurity increased to 14 .6% compared to the 2017-2018 Canadian Community Health Survey results (10.5%) [2] . Even prior to the pandemic, food insecurity disproportionately affected Indigenous households-where almost three in ten Indigenous adults lived in food-insecure households [3] . The arrival of COVID-19 further exacerbated already existing food security challenges faced by Indigenous communities, with a high levels of economic, health, and social inequities [4] .",

The concept of food worry, the experience of stress or worry about having enough food to meet basic needs [7] , is connected most closely with the classification of marginal food insecurity, which is described as being worried that food would run out before getting money to buy more [5] . In contrast, there is a compromise in the quality and/or quantity of food consumed by the household in more severe forms of food insecurity. Prior research has identified that households experiencing marginal food insecurity are more similar to households experiencing moderate to severe food insecurity in terms of household sociodemographic characteristics than to food secure households [8] .",

The PHQ-2 is a validated tool to screen for symptoms of depression [21] [22] [23] and assesses the severity of depressive symptoms over the past 2 weeks: \"Over the last 2 weeks, how often have you been bothered by any of the following problems?\". The two items are \"Little interest or pleasure in doing things\" and \"Feeling down, depressed, or hopeless\". Respondents can rate their response from 0 (not at all) to 3 (nearly every day). The total score ranges from 0 -6, where a score of 3 is the validated cut point when screening for depression. The PHQ-2 has been shown to have good reliability in terms of internal consistency (\u03b1 = 0.84) and intraclass correlation scores (ICC = 0.92) in international studies [24] [25] [26] [27] .",

[24] showed that the risk for avoidable mortality was reduced by 32 -47% in Indigenous participants when controlling for education and income. The impacts of colonialism, ongoing structural discrimination and continued disregard for Indigenous autonomy has subjected many Indigenous People to racism, poverty, poor education, and residential instability, which all contribute to poor mental health [32, 33] . Structural discrimination and trauma impact Indigenous communities in ways that have been linked to high prevalence of depression and suicide [32] .

            "text": "Our findings showed an increased prevalence of food worry during the pandemic, from 7.8 to 14.8%, which is consistent with Canadian national surveys [2] . In addition, food worry during the pandemic was associated with both depression and anxiety symptoms, which is also consistent with some studies conducted during COVID-19. Fang et al. [16] found that during the pandemic, food insecurity in low-income American participants was associated with a higher risk of anxiety (OR 3.57; 95% CI 3.01 -4.23) and depression (OR 3.53; 95% CI 2.99 -4.17) [18] . Although these odds ratios are higher than in our study, we did not solely survey low-income participants, and used a Canadian cohort that may have experienced the pandemic differently from the American participants. For example, there was relatively low prevalence of COVID-19 in the Kingston area in comparison to much of the United States. Additionally, government-funded measures in Canada ensured the availability of financial support. For example, the Canada Emergency Response Benefit helped to mitigate income loss for employed and [7] who found that participants with food worry were more likely to feel anxious or worried (OR 1.36, 95% CI: 1.08 -1.71) but were not more likely to feel depressed (OR 1.25, 95% CI: 0.97 -1.61) [7] . This study did not control for pre-pandemic food worry, which was included in our analysis. In comparison to our study, McAuliffe and colleagues utilized a different avenue of data collection by distributing their online survey via the national polling vendor Maru/Matchbox, which randomly invites panel members (a total of 125,000 Canadian adults) to participate based on stratifications based on sociodemographic characteristics. The survey data collection occurred over a shorter duration compared to our study, from May 14-29, 2020. These dates corresponded with the loosening of restrictions that were initially implemented at the beginning of the pandemic. Our study collected responses over an 8 month period, beginning prior to the reopening after lockdown and including the time period in Fall 2020 when case numbers once again continued to increase. There were also differences between the study cohorts which may contribute to the contrasting results: the McAuliffe cohort has a considerably higher prevalence of participants who had a household income greater than $100,000 than our cohort (42.8 vs. 13.63%). Additionally, the proportion of Indigenous were more than three times higher in our cohort compared to the McAuliffe study (11.14 vs. 3.0%), The association between food insecurity and poorer mental health outcomes had been described before the COVID-19 pandemic. Nagata and colleagues found that even when adjusting for socio-demographic characteristics, food-insecure young adults were at increased risk of depression (OR 1.67, 95% CI 1.16-1.87) and anxiety or panic disorder (OR 2.76, 95% CI 2.14 -3.55) [10] . Recently, Shafiee et al. found that household food insecurity predicted depressive symptoms after adjusting [11] . More specific to the role of marginal food insecurity and food worry, past studies have supported the association between marginal food insecurity and poorer mental health [35] [36] [37] . Kolovos [37] . The consistent evidence demonstrating the association between food worry and poor mental health, and of worsening food insecurity and mental health during the pandemic have important policy and practice implications. Food insecurity is closely tied with income [38, 39] , and prior work has explored reducing income insecurity as a means of addressing food insecurity [40, 41] . Thus, our findings support the argument advanced by authors on the importance of robust income support policies, such as a Universal Basic Income, which may have important health benefits. In clinical practice, the strong relationship between food worry and poor mental health underscores the value of health care provider screening for social determinants of health such as food worry during primary care visits. Multiple health professional associations are recommending that physicians screen patients for social determinants of health such as food insecurity and refer those affected to community supports [42] [43] [44] . Screening is feasible and effective when conducted in the context of established, trusting relationships in which health professionals work to reduce stigma related to food insecurity [45] . Additionally, supports for behavioural strategies such as meal planning may be beneficial for food insecure households [46] .",

Building on research that has explored Indigenous Food Sovereignty initiatives as a culturally appropriate approach to enhance wellbeing (i.e. mental health and life satisfaction) and mitigate food insecurity [47, 48] , our findings support the importance of adequate funding for community driven solutions to mitigate food worry and contribute to Indigenous Food Sovereignty.",
