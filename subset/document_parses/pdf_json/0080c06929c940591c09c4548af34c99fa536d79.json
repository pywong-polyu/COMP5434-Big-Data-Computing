Only the LoF variants that are annotated as either stop gained or frameshift in the databases were studied. The numbering of the amino acid sequence of DPP9 in GnomAD is of the short form of DPP9. Therefore, to use the DPP9 long form, 29 was added to all protein sequence numbers for the gnomAD DPP9 LoF analyses. DPP9 variants from TCGA and COSMIC were found to be of the long form. Variants with a sequence number mismatch with the long form of DPP9 were excluded. In addition, if frameshift variants exported from gnomAD and TCGA occurred where there is no corresponding structural residue, these frameshift variants were considered unlikely to be DPP9 exonic LoF variants, and thus were excluded from this study.",

            "text": "Large-scale human genetic databases provide useful tools to study protein LoF variants and their associations with diseases. DPP9 LoF has not been explored previously. Therefore, we assessed data from several human genomic databases to identify DPP9 LoF and potentially associated diseases. Gaining a premature termination codon (PTC), or stop codon, anywhere in a gene of the DPP4 gene family is expected to ablate enzyme activity [45] . We have shown previously that mature termination mutants of DPP8 are inactive, even if lacking only the C-terminal alpha-helix [45] . Similarly, any frameshift variant is almost certain to lack activity due to nonsense sequence causing a PTC. Therefore, the exonic gene variants considered to be LoF are very likely true LoF. In gnomAD, there were 18 exonic variants of DPP9 that were tagged as LoF. However, examining the sequence of long-form DPP9 in the UniProt Consortium database revealed that some variants were mismatched with UniProt, and thus were excluded. Only exonic LoF variants that were annotated as either stop-gained or frameshift variants were included in this study. We identified three frameshift variants and seven stop gained variants that were exonic in gnomAD (Table 3 ). There was no record of associated diseases for each mutation variant. In TCGA, we identified eight DPP9 LoF variants (Table 4) , and none of these variants were the same as found in gnomAD. Four DPP9 variants were designated as stop gained, with three of them associated with primary uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma (UCEC). Another four DPP9 variants were designated as frameshift mutation, with half of them found in patients diagnosed with stomach adenocarcinoma ( Table 4 ). None of the DPP9 variants in TCGA were found to be associated with HCC. There were many more DPP8 than DPP9 LoF gene variants in TCGA, found in diverse types of cancer, mostly in UCEC and one in HCC (Supplementary Table S1 ). In a separate database, COSMIC, eleven DPP9 variants had been tagged as nonsense mutation and were substitution mutations resulting in PTC codons (Table 5 ). These variants were associated with different types of carcinoma, most often lung carcinoma. All variants that were likely to cause LoF for DPP8 or DPP9 have a PTC. All exonic DPP9 variants found in each of the three databases were mapped to the DPP9 protein structure (Supplementary Figure S2) . There were 22 DPP8 nonsense mutations in COSMIC, most often in colon adenocarcinoma and one in HCC (Supplementary Table S2 ). DPP9 variants Glutamic acid (Glu) 154 to PTC and Arginine (Arg) 303 to PTC were both reported in both TCGA and COSMIC, but with different nucleotide substitutions. Another anomaly was that in COSMIC, both endometrioid carcinoma and colon adenocarcinoma were associated with the Arg303* variant, but in TCGA only endometrioid carcinoma was recorded.",

We analyzed genetic variation tolerance in the DPP4 gene family using five scores: observed to expected ratio (o:e), probability of LoF intolerance (pLI), haploinsufficiency score, tolerance percentile, and gene damage index (GDI) scores. When o:e is approximately 0.1, the gene is haploinsufficient and heterozygous LoF is very probably not tolerated; when o:e is between 0.1 and 0.5, the heterozygous LoF may be tolerated; when o:e is close to 1, LoF is tolerated [46] . DPP8 and DPP9 had low o:e, little more than 0.1, DPP4 had a moderate o:e less than 0.5 and FAP has a high o:e ( Table 6 ). The probability of LoF intolerance (pLI) is the probability of a given gene being haploinsufficient; genes with pLI \u2265 0.9 are extremely intolerant to LoF variation and genes with pLI \u2264 0.1 are LoF tolerant [46] . The pLI scores for DPP9, DPP8, DPP4 and FAP (Table 6 ) suggested that DPP8 and DPP9 LoF variants are poorly tolerated. Haploinsufficient genes only contain a single copy of a diploid genome that changes the organism phenotype from a normal to disease state, and many of the LoF-associated haploinsufficient genes contribute to metabolic disorders and tumorigenesis [47] . The haploinsufficiency score was greater for DPP9 than for DPP8, DPP4 or FAP, and, like the o:e and pLI, indicated that DPP9 is likely to exhibit haploinsufficiency whereas DPP4 and FAP are unlikely to exhibit haploinsufficiency. The gene damage index (GDI) scores for these four enzymes were low ( Table 6 ), suggesting that LoF variants are likely to be disease-causing [48] . Genes in the 25th tolerance percentile and below are considered relatively intolerant to variation. Unlike the other haploinsufficiency indications, GDI and tolerance percentile did not discriminate amongst the four genes (Table 6 ). Table 6 . Genetic variation tolerance in the DPP4 gene family. The o:e ratio, pLI and haploinsufficiency score were retrieved from gnomAD and DECIPHER.

Therefore, we analyzed whether DPPs expression is associated with patient survival in HCC and UCEC. Clinical parameters and mRNA expression of DPPs in patients with HCC and UCEC were exported from TCGA. Patient demographics are presented in Supplementary Table S4 . Patients were stratified by upper or lower quartile expression of DPPs. Kaplan-Meier analysis for DPP9, DPP8, DPP4 and FAP mRNA suggested that expression of none of these four genes was associated with HCC overall survival (OS) ( Figure 1A-D) . In contrast, patients with low DPP9 mRNA expression had significantly shorter survival time for UCEC ( Figure 1E ). Less than 15% of UCEC patients with low DPP9 expression had survived for 10 years after diagnosis. Unlike DPP9, DPP8, DPP4 and FAP expression did not associate with OS in UCEC ( Figure 1F-H) .

Epidemiology studies have shown that globally, the numbers of male HCC patients are two to four times greater than female HCC patients [15, 49] . Our results showed that significantly greater expression of DPP9 was detected in liver tumors from females than males ( Figure 2E ). It may be expected that HCC patients with greater age and advance stage of cancer will have more expression of DPP9 and therefore poorer prognosis. However, DPP9 expression did not differ significantly amongst six age groups ( Figure 2F ), or amongst different cancer stages ( Figure 2G ). In addition, we used Cox proportional hazards model with gender as a covariate to re-evaluate the associations between DPP9 expression and survival. DPP9 expression was not significantly associated with poor prognosis based on patients' gender (Supplementary Table S5) .",

In HCC patients, all four DPP genes were significantly upregulated in tumors compared to normal tissue (Figure 2A-D) . Epidemiology studies have shown that globally, the numbers of male HCC patients are two to four times greater than female HCC patients [15, 49] . Our results showed that significantly greater expression of DPP9 was detected in liver tumors from females than males ( Figure 2E ). It may be expected that HCC patients with greater age and advance stage of cancer will have more expression of DPP9 and therefore poorer prognosis. However, DPP9 expression did not differ significantly amongst six age groups ( Figure 2F ), or amongst different cancer stages ( Figure 2G ). In addition, we used Cox proportional hazards model with gender as a covariate to re-evaluate the associations between DPP9 expression and survival. DPP9 expression was not significantly associated with poor prognosis based on patients' gender (Supplementary Table S5 ). Obesity is a well-known risk factor for HCC [16] , so we examined DPP9 expression with HCC patient survival based on body mass index (BMI; BMI categories in Table 2 ). We stratified HCC patients based on BMI and found that DPP9 mRNA was significantly upregulated in the obese and extreme obese patients compared to patients with normal body weight ( Figure 3A ).

Firstly, we analyzed the two homologs DPP8 and DPP9 and found that 661 genes were positively correlated in-common between DPP8 and DPP9 ( Figure 5A ). Reactome pathway enrichment analysis revealed that these genes were associated with tumor suppressor TP53 regulation and with chromatin remodeling pathways in HCC ( Figure 5B ).

Firstly, we analyzed the two homologs DPP8 and DPP9 and found that 661 genes were positively correlated in-common between DPP8 and DPP9 ( Figure 5A ). Reactome pathway enrichment analysis revealed that these genes were associated with tumor suppressor TP53 regulation and with chromatin remodeling pathways in HCC ( Figure 5B ). In contrast, only 10 negatively correlated genes in-common between DPP8 and DPP9 were identified and they were associated with metabolism related pathways (Supplementary Figure S3B) . To gain a better understanding of how DPPs may influence survival, we analyzed the biological pathways that were enriched in genes that were positively correlated with DPPs. There were 46 significantly enriched pathways according to reactome annotations for those 268 genes (Supplementary Table S5 ). Amongst the 15 top-ranked pathways ( Figure 6C ), the Toll-like receptors (TLRs) cascade, especially the TLR9 and TLR7/8 cascade, MyD88 dependent cascade initiated on endosome, N-glycosylation and SUMOylation pathways were dominant. When FAP was added to this analysis, only seven incommon genes emerged, most of which are the zinc finger gene regulators LIMS1, PHF20L1, ZEB1 and ZNFX1 (Supplementary Figure S4) .",

Perhaps the role of DPP9 that is dominant differs in different cancer types and differs depending upon whether high or low DPP9 expression occurred in the tumor or was life-long.

The necessity of DPP9 is conserved in mice, where constitutive homozygous ablation of DPP9 enzyme activity is neonate lethal [25, [53] [54] [55] . There were fewer than expected numbers of LoF variants observed in the three large-scale databases that we interrogated. The reason could be that the association with gynecological cancers, mentioned above, also associates with poor reproductive fitness. In addition, people who are homozygous or biallelic for a DPP9 LoF variant may not survive to be included in the searched databases, or survivors possibly possess a modification in a molecular pathway that compensates for DPP9 deficiency. An example is that deletion of NLRP1 and its downstream signaling molecules rescues DPP9 deficient mice from lethality [56] . Another consideration is that the LoF DPP9 variants in genomic databases are expected to be heterozygous and would therefore have lifelong low DPP9 expression throughout the body. Taken together, these data show that DPP9 is LoF intolerant but suggest that DPP9 LoF variants do not necessarily cause early death.",

Even though age is known not to be an independent risk factor associated with cancer survival, the cumulative 10-year survival rate was significantly higher in younger patients [60] . Here, we saw no significant difference in DPP9 expression among different age groups. Moreover, patients diagnosed with advanced cancer stages would generally have shorter life spans, but our results showed that DPP9 expression was not associated with cancer stage. Taken together, the difference in survival probability amongst age groups and patients at different cancer stages may not be attributed to the expression of DPP9. Obesity is an independent risk factor for developing HCC. Our data showed that DPP9 expression was significantly upregulated in HCC patients who were obese/extremely obese, but significantly downregulated in overweight HCC patients. However, survival analysis on BMI showed no significant association with DPP9 expression, despite a hazard ratio greater than 1. As liver cancer is a multifactorial disease, further investigations may combine several risk factors together and investigate multiple comparisons between these parameters.",

            "text": "Enriched biochemical pathways analysis provided insights into differentially expressed genes correlated with DPPs in human HCC. Positively correlated genes in-common between DPP8 and DPP9 were associated with oncogenic and chromatin remodeling pathways in HCC, whilst 10 negatively correlated genes were associated with metabolism related pathways (Supplementary Figure S3A) . Mutation of the tumor suppressor TP53 is associated with poor outcome for HCC patients [61] . The top ranking TP53 regulation pathway in our analyses indicates that DPP8 and DPP9 overexpression could be oncogenic in human HCC. The downregulation of metabolism genes with DPP8 and DPP9 upregulation concords with previous data showing that DPP9 deficiency dysregulates metabolic pathways in neonatal liver and gut [54] , and that DPP9 hydrolyses metabolism related substrates including adenylate kinase 2 [62, 63] and nucleobindin1 [64] and regulates preadipocyte differentiation [65] . Moreover, people with obesity are more likely to develop HCC [66, 67] . DPP9 expression was significantly upregulated in HCC patients who were obese and extremely obese compared to those with normal weight. Taken together, this information suggests that DPP9 has an important role in liver manifestations of the metabolic syndrome, which drives progression to NASH, fibrosis and HCC.",

Amongst the identified reactome pathways, the TLR cascade, glycosylation and SUMOylation were the most frequent pathways enriched with increased DPP9 mRNA expression. No association between DPP9 and glycosylation is known. SUMOylation is mostly associated with SUMOylation of chromatin organization proteins, and SUMOylation of DNA damage response and repair proteins, which could have roles in cancer development. SUMO1 is a DPP9 interacting protein, acting as an allosteric regulator of DPP9 and thereby influencing its enzymatic activity [23] . TLR7/8 and TLR9 signaling pathways have not been linked to DPP9 previously. The expression of TLRs is low in healthy liver [68] . TLRs are upregulated in HCC tissues [69] , and inhibition of TLR7 and TLR9 eliminates the proliferation of liver cancer cells [69, 70] . Therefore, overexpression of DPPs might activate these TLR cascades, thereby inducing overactivation of the innate immune system and pathological changes.",

DPP9 was found to be very LoF-intolerant and its LoF exonic variants were mostly associated with cancers. Two intronic variants that lower DPP9 expression and have been linked to lung fibrosis and COVID-19 were not associated with HCC or liver fibrosis. In HCC patients, DPP9 and its closely related genes were significantly upregulated in liver tumors. High co-expression of genes that were positively correlated and in-common amongst DPP4, DPP8 and DPP9 were associated with poor survival of HCC patients, possibly via affecting the following enriched pathways: Toll-like receptors (TLRs), glycosylation and SUMOylation. These findings strongly implicate the DPP4 gene family, especially DPP9, in the pathogenesis of human HCC and therefore requires future functional studies.",
