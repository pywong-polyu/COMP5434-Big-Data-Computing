Differential expression profiles of miRNAs across a range of diseases have emerged as powerful biomarkers, making a reliable yet rapid profiling technique for miRNAs potentially essential in clinics. Here, we report an amplification-free multi-color single-molecule imaging technique that can profile purified endogenous miRNAs with high sensitivity, specificity, and reliability. Compared to previously reported techniques, our technique can discriminate single base mismatches and singlenucleotide 3\u2032-tailing with low false positive rates regardless of their positions on miRNA. By preloading probes in Thermus thermophilus Argonaute (TtAgo), miRNAs detection speed is accelerated by more than 20 times. Finally, by utilizing the well-conserved linearity between single-molecule spot numbers and the target miRNA concentrations, the absolute average copy numbers of endogenous miRNA species in a single cell can be estimated. Thus our technique, Ago-FISH (Argonaute-based Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization), provides a reliable way to accurately profile various endogenous miRNAs on a single miRNA sensing chip.",

Binding of miRNAs on the spot is detected by adding fluorescently labeled streptavidin. Using this technique, we can monitor a large number of target miRNAs in low cost, but the specificity and dynamic range of microarray analysis are limited because a RNA-DNA duplex of 20 base pairs is quite stable, and as a result, single base pair difference cannot be detected. In a conventional miRNA sequencing, extracted miRNAs are ligated with RNA adapters on both the 3\u2032-and 5\u2032-sides, converted into DNA strands by reverse transcriptase, and amplified using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). After each enzymatic step, the reaction products should be purified using PAGE (polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis), and the final products are sequenced using a sequencing machine. The RNA-sequencing technique is suitable for high-throughput miRNA profiling, and can discover uncharacterized miRNAs, but rather expensive and its precision of quantitation is poor. Furthermore, uneven enzymatic reactions cause bias in miRNA detection. Recently, the bias problem of RNA sequencing was improved by adopting random adapters and crowding reaction conditions, but not completely solved 15 . In a conventional quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR), extracted miRNAs are converted into DNA using reverse transcription, and progress of quantitative PCR is monitored using a special fluorescent probe. qRT-PCR is known to be relatively precise, but prone to bias and can be easily contaminated by pri-and pre-miRNAs 13, 16 .",

We first prepared a target synthetic RNA that contained let-7a target sequence on the 5\u2032side and U15 linker on the 3\u2032-side (Fig. 1a) . The RNA was biotinylated on the 3\u2032-end, and thus could be immobilized on a quartz surface by using streptavidin-biotin interaction. For miRNA detection, we prepared three DNA probes (let-7a_PS, let-7a_PM, and let-7a_PT in Fig. 1b) to detect the seed, mid, and tail regions of let-7a miRNA, respectively; the sequences colored in black, green, and red are complementary to the regions of let-7a miRNA indicated by the bars of the same color in Fig. 1a . Since the DNA probes were distinctly labeled with Cy7, Cy3, and Cy5, their binding to miRNAs could be distinguished using singlemolecule multicolor fluorescence imaging. When we designed DNA probes, the lengths of the complementary part of the DNA probes were optimized so that they had comparable binding/ dissociation kinetics on target miRNAs by compensating the varying GC contents of the seed, mid, and tail regions. The sequence of noncomplementary part of DNA probes was not critical, but selected for DNA probes not to form secondary structures. The overall length of DNA probes was maintained at 21 nt.",

To solve this problem, and accelerate the target binding of DNA probes, we preloaded the DNA probes in Thermus thermophilus Argonaute (TtAgo). TtAgo was selected among various Argonaute proteins from different species, because it was well characterized in the laboratory, stable, and did not have a cleavage activity at the temperature used for the experiments (30\u00b0C) 20, 21 . It is possible that a better choice of Argonaute proteins exists for Ago-FISH. After assembling TtAgo and DNA probes, we simultaneously injected the three kinds of TtAgo-loaded DNA probes into a detection chamber where target RNAs were immobilized on a polymer-coated quartz surface using streptavidin-biotin interaction (Fig. 1c) , and binding of the three DNA probes to target miRNAs were monitored using a multicolor single-molecule fluorescence microscope [22] [23] [24] . Following the injection of DNA probes, a large number of singlemolecule spots appeared in all the imaging channels of Cy3, Cy5, and Cy7 (Fig. 1d) . On the other hand, a negligible number of single-molecule spots were observed without target miRNA immobilization (Fig. 1e) , and the number of single-molecule spots were significantly reduced in the presence of ten times excessive unlabeled competitor DNA probes (Fig. 1f ). As shown in representative fluorescence time traces (Fig. 1g) , TtAgo-loaded DNA probes exhibited significantly increased binding rates of DNA probes compared to bare DNA probes; quantitative measurements showed more than an order of magnitude increase (19.7, 20.1, and 24.1 times for let-7a_PS, let-7a_PM, and let-7a_PT, respectively) of the binding rate constants of the DNA probes (Fig. 1h ). Interestingly and favorably for miRNA detection, the dissociation rates were also increased (3.2, 1.8, and 2.4 times for let-7a_PS, let-7a_PM, and let-7a_PT, respectively) when the DNA probes were loaded in TtAgo (Fig. 1i ).",

In the miRNA detection technique where miRNAs were captured using a strong RNA-LNA hybridization of the 3\u2032-half of miRNAs 17 , the high specificity of single-nucleotide discrimination could not be demonstrated for the miRNA region used for surface immobilization. To demonstrate the high specificity of Ago-FISH for the whole region of miRNA, we prepared three let-7a mutants-let-7a_m1, let-7a_m2, and let-7a_m3-that had a one-nucleotide mutation in the seed, mid, and tail regions of let-7a, respectively (Fig. 2a) . Representative binding traces of the let-7a probes on the let-7a mutants clearly showed that the binding of the DNA probes targeting the mutated region was significantly and selectively decreased (Fig. 2b) . For a quantitative analysis, we selected all time traces which showed the binding of any of the three DNA probes during observation, and obtained the average duty cycle (the fraction of observation time in which a probe was binding to the target miRNA) of each probe. As shown in Fig. 2c , the average duty cycle of the mutated region-targeting probes decreased significantly compared to the original values of 19%, 17%, and 23% of let-7a_PS, let-7a_PM, and let-7a_PT, respectively (Fig. 2c) . It was noticeable that the duty cycle of let-7a_PT was also reduced a little in the case of let-7a_m2 because the 3\u2032-end of the target recognition sequence of let-7a_PT probe overlapped the mutated base of let-7a_m2. This reduction, however, did not cause any problem but only favorable effect in target discrimination. In the case of wild-type let-7a, most of traces (98.2%) showed the binding of the three DNA probes except the minor portion of traces, which showed either one-probe binding (0.5 %) or twoprobe binding (1.3 %), demonstrating that Ago-FISH could detect target miRNAs with a high fidelity.",

The average number of spots per imaging area (20 \u03bcm \u00d7 60 \u03bcm) identified as let-7a and let-7c, using 5% duty cycle threshold increased linearly with their concentrations during the immobilization step, giving the similar slopes of 2.8 spot/pM for let-7a and 2.7 spot/pM for let-7c (Fig. 3d) . On the other hand, the fitting curves for let-7a and let-7c quantification using qRT-PCR were quite different ( Supplementary Fig. 6a) , indicating that different quantification parameters should be used for the quantification of different miRNAs in the qRT-PCR method. In our scheme of miRNA detection, all different miRNAs are captured using the same poly(A) tail, and therefore similar capturing efficiencies of different miRNAs are naturally expected. However, the miRNA detection efficiencies of DNA probes depend on the design of DNA probes. It remains to be tested whether the similar calibration parameters can be obtained for other miRNA targets by optimizing DNA probes.",

Even when the synthetic let-7a and let-7c miRNAs were spiked in total RNA extract of HeLa cell, where various endogenous miRNAs coexisted, no apparent change in the slopes of the fitting curves was observed (2.8 spot/pM for the both miRNAs; Fig. 3e ), indicating that the same calibration parameter could be used for the quantification of both synthetic, and endogenous miRNAs in Ago-FISH. The y-intercept of the let-7a data, however, was 13 times larger than that of let-7c data (17.5 vs. 1.3, Fig. 3e) , indicating let-7a was more abundant than let-7c in HeLa cell, which was consistent with the RNAsequencing results (data not shown). On the contrary, the qRT-PCR results of the same spike-in experiments showed that fitting parameters for miRNA quantification changed a lot in the presence of endogenous RNAs ( Supplementary Fig. 6b) , and the Ct (cycle threshold) value of let-7a was measured larger than that of let-7c ( Supplementary Fig. 6b) , although the absolute quantity of let-7a was larger than that of let-7c due to the endogenous miRNA contribution. Furthermore, the Ct values of let-7a and let-7c of the spike-in experiments were measured larger than those of pure synthetic RNAs ( Supplementary Fig. 6 ) despite of the existence of endogenous let-7a and let-7c miRNAs. We suspected that various endogenous RNAs existing in cell lysate significantly interfered the qRT-PCR quantification of miRNAs.",

We tailed total RNA of 0.02 \u00b5g/ \u00b5l from HeLa, and captured them on a miRNA sensing chip. From more than three experiments, the average spot numbers of let-7a were counted as 17.3 \u00b1 3.8, giving the concentrations of 6.2 pM (3,730,000 molecules/\u00b5l) when we used the calibration parameter of 2.8 spot/pM. Based on previous reports 28 , we assumed that a single HeLa cell contained 20 pg of total RNA on average, and, therefore, 1 \u00b5l of 0.02 \u00b5g/\u00b5l total RNA solution contained total RNA from 1000 HeLa cells. From these considerations, we could estimate that a single HeLa cell contained 3730 \u00b1 830 let-7a on average (Fig. 3f, left) . To test whether Ago-FISH could monitor the dynamic change of miRNA expression, we quantified let-7a when it was overexpressed in various cells (\"Method\" section). We found that the let-7a number per single cell increased significantly (Fig. 3f and Supplementary Fig. 7) when let-7a was overexpressed. On the other hand, let-7a vanished (Supplementary Fig. 7) in Drosha knockout cells (\"Method\" section), confirming that Ago-FISH could reliably monitor the dynamic change of miRNA expression.",

            "text": "In this work, we developed a highly reliable miRNA profiling technique, Ago-FISH, based on multicolor single-molecule imaging. Like the previously reported single-molecule miRNA detection technique, SiMREPS (Single-Molecule Recognition through Equilibrium Poisson Sampling) 17 , Ago-FISH has the superior sensitivity, and the simplicity of workflow that does not require the enzymatic steps, such as amplification, reverse transcription, and ligation. Compared to SiMREPS, however, Ago-FISH has the merits of the increased miRNA detection speed, and the conservation of the high target specificity for the whole region of miRNAs. Furthermore, all miRNAs are captured in a single-miRNA sensing chip, and therefore, Ago-FISH can be converted to a high-throughput miRNA profiling technique when it is combined with microfluidics. The need to use purified proteins for miRNA detection, however, is a demerit of Ago-FISH. Compared to qRT-PCR, Ago-FISH is much more reliable due to reduced false positive rates, and not contaminated by pri-and pre-miRNAs ( Supplementary Fig. 10 ). In this work, we demonstrated that miRNAs in the pM range can be reliably detected (Fig. 3e) , but it should not be interpreted as the limit of Ago-FISH sensitivity. As already demonstrated in SiMREPS, the sensitivity of Ago-FISH can be improved to the fM range by increasing the miRNA capturing time 17 . The utilization of CMOS (complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor) camera instead of electron multiplying charge-coupled device (EM-CCD) will increase the imaging area, and thus the number of detected molecules per screen by an order of magnitude, and as a result the sensitivity of Ago-FISH can be improved further. Transient binding of DNA probes has been utilized for superresolution fluorescence microscopy, such as DNA-PAINT 29 , but slow binding rates of DNA probes have hindered a wider application of the approach. Furthermore, endogenous miRNAs have never been imaged using DNA-PAINT. The accelerated target binding of TtAgo-loaded DNA probes will allow the combination of Ago-FISH with superresolution fluorescence microscopy of endogenous miRNAs, which might provide valuable information on the spatial distribution of miRNAs in cells and tissues. In this work, Ago-FISH is used only to quantify miRNAs. The same technique, however, can be utilized to quantify other nucleic acids, such as mRNAs with accelerated binding rate, improved specificity, and not being limited by photobleaching.",

Exosomal total RNA was extracted using MiniBest Universal RNA Extraction Kit (Takara).",

Yeast poly(A) polymerase (Thermo Fisher) was used to add the poly(A) tail to RNA. Specifically, 0.1 \u00b5g/\u00b5l RNA was incubated at 37\u00b0C for 1 h in a 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.0) buffer with 20 \u03bcM EDTA, 0.2 mM DTT, 0.6 mM MnCl 2 , 10% glycerol, 100 \u03bcg/ml acetylated BSA, 2.5 mM rATP, 40 U/\u00b5l yeast poly(A) polymerase (Thermo Fisher), and 0.5 U/\u00b5l RNase inhibitor (SUPERase.In Tm , Thermo Fisher). The reaction was terminated by heating at 65\u00b0C for 15 min. It was reported that the 3\u2032-terminal nucleotide influences the poly(A) tail efficiency 11 . In our method, the capturing efficiency is not expected to vary significantly once the poly (A) tail is longer than 30 nt (the length of the complementary DNA use for capturing miRNAs). Furthermore, the influences of the 3\u2032-terminal nucleotide on miRNA capturing efficiency could be effectively avoided by maintaining the poly (A) tailing reaction for 1 h (ref. 32 ).",

To reduce nonspecific binding of molecules, glass/quartz surface was coated with a mixture of PEG and biotin-PEG with 20:1 ratio. A detection chip was made between a quartz slide and a glass coverslip by using double-side sticky tape 33 . For experiments described in Fig. 3 , 0.1 \u00b5g/\u00b5l poly(A)-tailed total RNA was incubated with 3 \u00b5M biotinylated poly(T) for 3 h. After the incubation, 0.1 \u00b5g/\u00b5l total RNA was diluted to 0.02 \u00b5g/\u00b5l using 10 mM Tris buffer (pH 8.0) with 50 mM NaCl, and then immobilized on surface by streptavidin-biotin interaction. For the experiments described in Figs. 1 and 2 , biotinylated synthetic miRNAs were directly immobilized on a surface without the tailing and hybridization processes. To assemble TtAgo and DNA probes, the three kinds of DNA probes (0.2 \u03bcM) was separately incubated with TtAgo (1 \u03bcM) for 30 min at 55\u00b0C in an assembly buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) buffer with 100 mM NaCl, and 5 mM MgCl 2 ). TtAgo and DNA probes make a complex with a 1:1 stoichiometry, but excessive amount of TtAgo was used to reduce the amount of free DNA probes not loaded into TtAgo. For Ago-FISH experiments, the three kinds of TtAgo-loaded DNA probes were mixed, diluted to the final concentration of 2 nM in an imaging buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) buffer with 135 mM KCl, 0.5% formamide, 120 mM UREA, 1 mM Mg 2+ , and oxygen scavenger system: 5 mM protocatechuic acid, 500 nM protocatechuate 3,4-dioxygenase, and saturated Trolox (25 mg/50 ml)), and injected into the detection chamber. Single-molecule fluorescence imaging experiments were started right after the injection of DNA probes at 30\u00b0C. Cy3, Cy5, and Cy7 were excited by a 532-nm laser (Compass215M, Coherent), a 640-nm laser (Cube640-100C, Coherent), and a 730-nm laser (PhoxX\u00ae 730, Omicron), respectively. The laser intensities were adjusted to obtain similar signal intensities of the three dyes. For alternative laser excitation (ALEX) used for data collection, three mechanical shutters (LS-3, Uniblitz, Rochester, NY) were alternatively switched every 0.5 s synchronously with the frame rate of the camera, giving the overall time resolution of imaging as 1.5 s. Fluorescence signals of Cy3, Cy5, and Cy7 were collected through a water-immersion objective (UPlanSApo 60\u00d7, Olympus), separated by using two dichroic mirrors (635dcxr and 740dcxr, Chroma), and imaged on an EM-CCD camera (Ixon DV897, Andor). Data were collected by using home-built program written in Visual C++ (Microsoft), and analyzed by using IDL (7.0, ITT), MATLAB (R2010a, The MathWorks), and Origin (8.0, OriginLab).",
