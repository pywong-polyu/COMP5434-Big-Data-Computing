            "text": "Life outcomes for people who spent time in the care of the state as children ('care-experienced') are known to be significantly lower, on average, than for the general population. The reasons for this are complex and multidimensional, relating to social upheaval, disrupted schooling, mental and physical health issues and societal stigmatisation. Previous studies across several countries have demonstrated that they are significantly less likely to participate in higher education and more likely to withdraw early. However, little is currently known about their outcomes after graduation. This paper therefore explores the initial outcomes for the 1,010 full-time students identified as care-experienced within the cohort graduating from an undergraduate degree programme in the UK in 2016/17-the most recent year for which data are available. They were found to be slightly more likely to be unemployed and less likely to be in work (and particularly professional work) than their peers, but, conversely, more likely to be studying. These differences largely disappeared once background educational and demographic factors were controlled. The paper discusses the relationship between care-experience and other sites of inequality, concluding that care-experienced graduates are crucially over-represented in groups that are disadvantaged in the graduate labour market-e.g. by ethnicity, disability or educational history. This intersectional inequality largely explains their lower graduate outcomes. While there are important limitations with the data available, this speaks for the transformational potential of higher education in enabling care-experienced graduates to transcend childhood adversity. Recommendations for national policy and local practices conclude the paper.",

About 1% of the UK child population is in care at any one time. Adults who were in care at some point in their childhood are often referred to as 'care-experienced' and are the focus of this paper.",

School attainment amongst care-experienced individuals is generally lower than the wider population (Sebba et al. 2015) . Understandably, lower attainment can subsequently impact on higher education (HE) participation rates for those who are care-experienced and largely explains why they are severely underrepresented at this level of study. In England, the HE participation rate for care-experienced students is around 12% up to the age of 23, compared with 43% in the general population (Harrison 2017) . Care-experienced students include both those transitioning into HE directly from care (often referred to as 'care leavers') and those returning in later adulthood; the latter group predominates, without around half being over 21 on entry (Harrison 2020) .",

            "text": "While emerging literature has provided understandings of challenges and enablements in accessing and progressing through HE, there is a knowledge gap concerning graduate outcomes for care-experienced students. Other groups who are underrepresented in HE have been noted to encounter specific challenges when accessing the labour market and further study opportunities upon graduation (Behle 2016; Britton et al. 2016; Zwysen and Longhi 2018 ). Yet, the legacy of care could result in potentially unique disadvantages when transitioning out of HE. These may include an absence of informal support networks (or 'social capital') that can enhance access to employment opportunities (Stein 2012) , unstable accommodation (Bengtsson et al. 2018 ; Centre for Social Justice [CSJ] 2019; Wilson et al. 2019) , financial difficulties (Cotton et al. 2014; Gypen et al. 2017) , mental/physical health issues (McNamara et al. 2019; O'Neill et al. 2019; Wilson et al. 2019) and societal stigma (Stein 2012) . Despite most higher education institutions (HEIs) in the UK offering support for care-experienced students entering, and progressing through, their undergraduate studies, this often ends at or before graduation. There is little or no targeted support for care-experienced students' graduate transitions, which can lead to high levels of anxiety over the future (Ellis and Johnston 2019) . Such anxieties may affect how students make their plans for graduation, resulting in some options being closed off (Stevenson et al. 2020) . To understand how care-experienced students who successfully enter and progress through HE fare after graduation, this paper uses the most recent national survey data available (from 2016/17) to provide the first insight into graduate outcomes for these students.",

A number of reasons for this have been suggested. The proximal cause is undoubtedly that they are less likely to hold qualifications offering entry to HE (Jackson et al. 2005; Sebba et al. 2015) 2 . However, there are also important distal factors. For example, care-experienced people are over-represented among those with long-term health issues, such as disability or mental health difficulties (Department for Education and Skills [DfES] 2007; O'Neill et al. 2019) , as well as in substance misuse and offending behaviour (Dixon 2007) . These are often the result of circumstances that saw the child entering care, such as abuse and neglect (CSJ 2019; McNamara et al. 2019) , or of experiences while in the care system itself. For instance, higher numbers of placement moves, which cause educational disruption, have been shown to have a detrimental impact on attainment (Jackson and Ajayi 2007; Sebba et al. 2015) . This is compounded by low educational expectations from others (Jackson et al. 2005; Wilson et al. 2019 ) and non-prioritisation of education by social workers in organising placements (Jackson and Cameron 2012) .",

Notably, care-experienced students are also 38% more likely to withdraw from their HE studies, all else being equal (Harrison 2017) . The most commonly cited reason for withdrawal amongst care-experienced students is academic challenges (Cotton et al. 2014; Harrison 2017) . This may partially be explained by the higher likelihood of care-experienced students entering HE via vocational pathways (Jackson and Ajayi 2007) , where students are shifting from programmes that use more practical and competency-based learning approaches to ones in HE that valorise critical knowledge (Catterall et al. 2013) . Other commonly reported reasons for withdrawal from HE for care-experienced students include mental health difficulties-particularly those that are complex and longstanding (Harrison 2017; Stevenson et al. 2020 )-and financial issues (Cotton et al. 2014) . In the face of such hardships, research has highlighted that support from a trusted individual and access to financial support is key to assisting in the transition into, and through, HE (Driscoll 2013) . This is also required beyond HE, with Courtney (2019) noting that a continuation in support from social workers for longer could allow the facilitation of networking opportunities for care-experienced graduates, enhancing employment outcomes.",

            "text": "Until now, graduate outcomes for care-experienced students have been unresearched. Yet, the general literature on graduate outcomes in the UK highlights inequalities experienced by other underrepresented groups in HE; this provides some indications of what care-experienced graduates may encounter when transitioning to employment and/or further study. Those from socioeconomically disadvantaged backgrounds earn, on average, 10% less upon graduation than their more-advantaged counterparts (Britton et al. 2016) . They are also less likely to be in professional employment following graduation (Higher Education Funding Council for England 2015). Students from minority ethnic groups are less likely to be employed 6 months after graduation, though differences in earnings are small (Zwysen and Longhi 2018) . A number of factors contribute to these outcomes, including the following: discipline studied, with STEM graduates being more likely to find graduate work (Behle 2016) , and be in receipt of higher earnings (DfE 2019b); prior attainment, with Britton et al. (2016) finding that much of the earnings difference amongst graduates is attributable to this; type of HEI attended, with those graduating from higher status 4 HEIs being more likely to successfully access top professions (Ashley et al. 2015) ; and degree classification, with those awarded first and upper-second class degrees being more likely to enter 'high skilled' employment (DfE 2019b). There are similar inequalities evident in progression to postgraduate study, with students from lower socioeconomic groups, those that studied at post-1992 institutions, and those studying 'applied' subjects (such as Education) as opposed to 'pure' subjects (e.g. Science) being less likely to progress to higher degrees (Wakeling and Hampden-Thompson 2013) .",

The second examines headline outcomes (work, further study and unemployment) for the two groups. The third uses logistic regression analysis to explore multivariate differences in outcomes between care-experienced and other graduates. Logistic regression allows for outcomes to be compared while holding a range of potential predictor variables constant and thereby seeking to isolate the specific contribution of care-experience to overall 5 The new Graduate Outcomes survey uses a broadly similar approach, but leaves a fifteen-month period between graduation and data collection to allow more time for graduates to have found their way into career-oriented work. 6 Under HESA's anonymity and disclosure requirements, all counts are rounded to the nearest five. outcomes, all else being equal (Field 2017) . SPSS v25 was used for analysis, and a 5% significance level was used. This paper has its origins in an earlier research project (Stevenson et al. 2020 ). The first two analytical stages outlined above are summarised from that project to provide essential context, but the third is unique to this paper and forms the basis of the subsequent discussion. Table 2 shows the demographic profile of the care-experienced graduate sample in comparison with other graduates. Several key differences are readily apparent. Care-experienced graduates had a higher preponderance to be disabled (24.7%, compared with 14.2%) and to be a non-UK national (16.3%, compared with 8.2%). They were older, on average, being over twice as likely to be aged 25 or over on entry (22.7%, compared with 9.2%). They were also disproportionately drawn from the Black, Other Asian and Mixed Heritage ethnic groups. Table 3 presents a similar analysis for education variables. Care-experienced graduates entered HE with weaker entry qualifications overall, also notably making more extensive use of alternative qualifications (e.g. Level 3 without tariff points) or prior experience. They were substantially less likely to attend Russell Group and other pre-1992 universities, which was partly-but not entirely-due to having lower entry qualifications (see Stevenson et al. 2020 for details on this point). There were modest differences in subjects studied between care-experienced and other graduates, with the former being somewhat over-represented in social sciences and creative arts, but underrepresented in natural sciences, technology-based subjects and the humanities, and among those taking a sandwich year. Importantly, care-experienced graduates were somewhat less likely to have received first or upper-second class degrees, although a clear majority still did so (70.1% , compared with 79.8% ); this could almost entirely be attributed to differences in entry qualifications and demographic profile. This first stage of analysis thus confirmed care-experienced graduates as having a distinct profile compared with the general population. They are more likely to be older, disabled, from a minority ethnic community and a non-UK national-all potential markers for educational disadvantage. In addition, they tended to have entered HE with lower entry qualifications, attended a lower status HEI and been awarded a lower classification of degree, although the former trends largely explained the latter. These patterns are consistent with previous studies of data on care-experienced students (e.g. Harrison 2017 Harrison , 2020 and more broadly with the care population (DfE 2019a). ",

A commonly used distinction between 'professional' (the first three classes) and 'non-professional' (the remainder) work shows 63.7% of care-experienced graduates in professional roles, compared with 68.5% of other graduates; restricting to those in full-time work only, the figures are 70.7% and 77.0% respectively. In other words, care-experienced graduates were somewhat less likely than their peers to be in professional roles 6 months after graduation, although the majority were. Care-experienced graduates were disproportionately likely to be working in public administration, social work and residential care, but less likely to be in the financial, legal or accounting industries; the overall salary profiles between care-experienced and other graduates were almost identical (see Stevenson et al. 2020 for details). Figure 3 shows the level of further study for those studying 6 months after graduation.

We take a positive graduate outcome to be either (a) working in a professional role and/or (b) studying on a postgraduate or professional course. In constructing this measure, we exclude graduates who report 'other' activities as they are effectively absent from the labour market for heterogeneous reasons (e.g. travelling). We appreciate that this is a considerable simplification. For example, some people in professional roles may not be in their preferred career, with others undertaking informal study for well-founded reasons. Also, the timescale of 6 months is one in which many graduates are 'finding their feet' and taking time to review their options. Nevertheless, for the purposes of comparing overall immediate outcomes for care-experienced and other graduates, we argue that the measure has utility. Using this compound measure, we find that 70.1% of care-experienced graduates had a positive graduate outcome, compared with 72.3% of other graduates; this difference was not statistically significant. By definition, the remainder were unemployed, in non-professional work or studying an additional undergraduate or informal course. To summarise, care-experienced graduates had broadly similar outcomes to other graduates-notably, this is despite having attended lower status HEIs and achieving lower degree results, on average. They were somewhat less likely to be working and to be in professional work, but conversely more likely to be studying.

            "text": "The majority of studies, however, find intersectional effects between care-experience and other sites of inequality that are somewhat better understood. For instance, in Barn et al.(2005) study of care leavers' transitions to adulthood, young people from minority ethnic groups faced racial discrimination in the workplace, which then had negative repercussions for future employment. This is also likely to impact on care-experienced non-UK nationals (including asylum seekers and refugees), in addition to language barriers, unfamiliarity with UK work culture and application processes (Stevenson and Willott 2007; Robinson and Williams 2017) . Similarly, being disabled can impact on fitness to find and engage in employment in itself, and disabled people can face discrimination by potential employers, resulting in HE to labour market transitions being 'disabling experiences in themselves' (Piggott and Houghton 2007, 585) . In O'Neill et al. (2019) survey of careexperienced students, those identifying as disabled reported more difficulties with accommodation, finances and trauma recovery. This is consistent with our findings. Care-experienced graduates are notably overrepresented in groups that do have markedly lower graduate outcomes, such as some disabled people, minority ethnic communities and non-UK nationals. In other words, the negative pressures on care-experienced students work primarily through these other sites of inequality, which will be shared to a greater or lesser extent with other students who are not careexperienced. For example, racial discrimination in the recruitment process or the lack of geographical mobility arising from disability are likely to impact on many graduatesrather, it is that care-experienced students have a constellation of overlapping and additive forms of disadvantage derived from their intersectional membership of multiple groups. This is not to argue that there are not distinct, or even unique, forms of disadvantage associated with being care-experienced. However, within the data available to this study, their impact is muted, with even the suggestion that once the other forms of disadvantage are controlled for, care-experienced graduates are doing slightly better than average. One possible explanation is that, while many do experience stigma or other disadvantages, some care-experienced graduates are able to draw on additional personal resources that actively assist them in moving into work or further study. These may be unrecognised by the individual, but discourses around heightened resolve, motivation and determination to succeed appear frequently in the literature (Harrison 2017; O'Neill et al. 2019) . Another explanation is that care-experienced students who complete their HE studies may have had positive experiences whilst in care that result in them successfully 'moving on', for instance, experiences of stability, continuity, positive relationships and educational success (Stein 2012) . These attributes and experiences could ameliorate the other care-related barriers to successful graduate transitions, although it should be remembered that the unemployment rate is somewhat higher for care-experienced graduates. In addition, care-experienced students tend to be markedly older than average when entering HE and our analysis suggests that increasing age is a predictor for positive graduate outcomes, possibly due to more prior experience of engaging with the labour market, greater accumulated social capital and a clearer career vision. This particular intersectionality therefore tends to act as a protective factor for care-experienced graduates.",

However, there are particular challenges associated with being care-experienced that can impinge on graduate transitions, leading to these being 'compressed' (Stein 2012) . Lacking family safety nets, care-experienced graduates may be more preoccupied with fulfilling their basic needs as quickly as possible through prioritising obtaining accommodation and locating a source of income (Dickens et al. 2014 ) after graduation. Instability in the labour market coupled with affordable housing shortages mean that there is increased reliance on family support for young people generally (Gypen et al. 2017) . Opportunities for 'yo-yo transitions' (Bengtsson et al. 2018 )-where graduates return to live in the parental home-are unavailable for care-experienced graduates, resulting in a lack of time and psychological space to formulate future plans (Stein 2012 ). An absence of family support also restricts the size of care-experienced graduates' social networks; this, in turn, limits access to useful information about employment opportunities (Clarke 2018) , placing them at a further disadvantage. This could lead to more dynamic and temporary outcomes (Br\u00e4nnstr\u00f6m et al. 2017) , with some care-experienced graduates feeling pressure to locate any form of employment immediately rather than professional employment specifically. Of course, this may not be the case for all care-experienced graduates, with those who continue to receive contact and support from former carers potentially experiencing more stable transitions out of HE (Stein 2012); Optych and Courtney (2019) argue that extended support periods are helpful to underpin educational outcomes.",

Ellis and Johnston (2019, 7) found that while many care-experienced students had faced profound challenges in HE, they often nevertheless felt 'that they found a place that they belonged'. Although financial and accommodation support from HEIs typically ends on completion of their undergraduate studies, progressing to postgraduate programmes could extend some sense of stability for care-experienced graduates, with emotional and other forms of support via professional staff and friendship networks within the HEI. Indeed, some students in Ellis and Johnston's (2019) study talked about their anxieties about moving on. Postgraduate study can therefore enable a more gradual transition from the supportive undergraduate environment to a more independent graduate life.",

As for other underrepresented groups, HE might provide 'reassurance' by increasing the chances of achieving stability by reducing the risk of long-term unemployment (Harrison 2019 ). Yet, for care-experienced students, the absence of safety nets means their need for 'pay off' is arguably higher. Engaging in postgraduate study may therefore be viewed as a way of increasing their chances in the graduate employment market; we explore this further in Baker, Harrison, Wakeling and Stevenson (forthcoming) . In addition, care-experienced students often express how their own childhood experiences motivate them to work in caring professions such as social work (Stevenson et al. 2020) ; these careers often necessitate a postgraduate qualification for entry. There is potentially, therefore, a double 'push' towards postgraduate study-remaining within a supportive and predictable environment while mitigating fears about securing work; the latter may be exacerbated by continuing mental health issues.",

            "text": "Why, then, do many care-experienced students opt to enter HE via alternative routes? Firstly, those undertaking vocational qualifications are more likely to be from minority ethnic groups and to be disabled (Kelly 2017) . As care-experienced individuals are over-represented in these groups, this can provide one explanation. Importantly though, some care-experienced people pursue vocational qualifications in an attempt to enter employment more quickly to become self-supporting as soon as possible upon leaving care (Jackson and Cameron 2012) . Others report that they were encouraged to take these pathways by carers, which is indicative of others' low educational expectations (Jackson et al. 2005) . Perhaps one of the most likely reasons for this though is that low levels of attainment in compulsory schooling arising from instability, placement moves and the legacy of trauma (Jackson and Ajayi 2007; Jackson et al. 2005; Sebba et al. 2015) lead to reduced options in post-compulsory education. This can limit HE pathways later, with a lack of parity across qualifications afforded by more selective HEIs which can translate to exclusionary admission processes (see Baker 2019) . Therefore, it is not necessarily that care-experienced students actively choose such routes into HE; rather, their options are constrained by circumstances arising from their care histories. This subsequently largely explains the difference in headline figures for positive graduate outcomes-a culmination of accumulated disadvantage that can be traced back, directly or more indirectly, to the individual's entry into care.",

No reliable data yet exist for part-time, postgraduate or international students, and we have had to exclude those entering full-time degree programmes through various alternative routes where no data on their care status exist. This latter exclusion is particularly unfortunate as we would expect care-experienced people to be over-represented in this group. Similarly, no data exist for people completing their degree in further education colleges as they are not included in the DLHE survey. It is, of course, possible that care-experienced graduates in these groups are substantively different from those in our study.",

Care-experienced graduates are overrepresented in known disadvantaged groups, and structural challenges faced by individuals within these groups who are not care-experienced will also be encountered by those who are. Importantly, reducing inequalities in access to HE for these groups will also significantly benefit care-experienced people. However, unique obstacles to achieving positive graduate outcomes that arise from being care-experienced persist, such as a lack of secure onward accommodation (CSJ 2019), financial difficulties (Cotton et al. 2014 ), stigma about care (Stein 2012) , an absence of emotional support (Stevenson et al. 2020 ) and limited social networks (Stein 2012) which can restrict access to information about employment opportunities (Clarke 2018) ; these can all make graduate transitions a period that is fraught with anxiety and instability and may explain why care-experienced graduates are somewhat more likely to find themselves unemployed or in non-professional work.

One perhaps easily implemented recommendation is for HEIs to promote the success of care-experienced graduates to students early on in their HE journeys; communicating this success may work to reduce HE withdrawal rates amongst care-experienced students and could be reassuring to those who have concerns when approaching completion of their studies. In order to create time and space for care-experienced graduates to transition into employment, HEIs could provide 'exit' bursaries and extend accommodation contracts for final year students past the point of completing their course. This would help to reduce immediate financial and housing pressures, affording the psychological space for care-experienced graduates to formulate future plans (Stein 2012) . In turn, this would help to reduce the pressure to locate any form of employment immediately to fulfil their basic needs (Dickens et al. 2014) , rather than professional employment, as these needs will be met in the immediate post-graduation phase. Additionally, focused alumni networks for care-experienced graduates should be developed to enable the continuous provision of careers-related information and guidance, increasing graduates' knowledge of pathways into professional employment and helping to reduce unemployment rates. This will also help care-experienced graduates maintain a sense of connection to their HEI, reducing feelings of isolation as well as apprehension over the sudden loss of HE-provided support following graduation (Ellis and Johnston 2019; Stevenson et al. 2020) .",
