Nevertheless, given the plurality of visual SQ ELH classification approaches that may vary in wording, resolution (3-or 4-point ordinal scale), or evaluation level (anatomical fixpoint), and can be sensitive to human bias, published results cannot be considered inherently reproducible, comparable or standardized (10) . Already an improvement in comparability, manual measurement of the ELS area in 2D within one MR-layer (11, 12) , or better yet, the entire ELS volume 3D over multiple MR-layers (13, 14) remain dependent on human decisions. Similar to optimizing entire iMR sequences in use to date (15) (16) (17) , automatic ELS quantification is predetermined by two methodical sticking points (18) : The first obstacle is to distinguish between total fluid space (TFS) within the entire inner ears bony labyrinth from the surrounding petrosal bone structures (19) (20) (21) . The second difficulty is distinguishing the two different fluid spaces within the TFS (22, 23) , namely ELS within the membranous labyrinth and the surrounding perilymphatic space (PLS) within the bony labyrinth. Current semi-automatic (24) (25) (26) or automatic (27, 28) 3D ELS quantification methods have mostly concentrated on ELS differentiation within TFS.",

Auto-segmentation of the inner ear (IE) involved data preparation and manual ground-truth annotation of the IEs total fluid space (TFS) masks in training (D1, grey shading) and test (D2-D5, white shading) datasets. First, pre-segmentations (orange boxes) were obtained in D1-D5 via a custom-built full-head template (FHT) and an inner-ear template (IET). Then, manual quality control (QC), followed by manual refinement of IE segmentations (purple boxes), trained and examined the IE-Vnet model. Finally, its predictions were validated under various forms of domain shift in the test datasets D2-D5 (cf. Table 1 ).",

On average, across all left and right inner ears and in all four test datasets, the Dice overlap coefficient showed a mean value of 0.900 \u00b1 0.020, the Hausdorff maximum surface distance a mean value of 0.93 \u00b1 0.71 mm), and the mean surface distance a mean value of 0.022 \u00b1 0.005 mm). Thus, the segmentation performance seems quantitatively consistent across the test datasets D2-D5 (cf. Figure 5 and Table 2A) , which was further confirmed by statistical analyses (cf. Section 3.3). The mean Likert scales of the inner ear structures were altogether consistently high (4.913 \u00b1 0.337) across both inner ears and in all four test datasets. However, depending on the location, shape and intricacy of the separate inner ear structures, Likert scores consistently differed in performance success (cf . Table 2B ) with the most robust results in the vestibulum (sacculus: 4.988 \u00b1 0.112, utriculus: 5.000 \u00b1 0.000), intermediate results in cochlea (4.925 \u00b1 0.265) and posterior SCC (4.888 \u00b1 0.477), and least robust results in the anterior (4.813 \u00b1 0.576) and horizontal SCC (4.863 \u00b1 0.590). The mentioned pattern can be verified in the several outliers, in particular in the Hausdorff distance values in both right and left inner ears. Two cases with outlier Hausdorff distances on the order on 3 mm and above are presented in Figures 6C,D. Visual inspection reveals that these comparatively high surface errors stem either from challenging cases, which were also difficult in manual ground truth segmentation in the horizontal and posterior SCC (panel D), or minor prediction artifacts in the anterior SCC such as isolated blobs, rather than gross mis-segmentations (panel C). Such artifacts could be filtered away through minor post-processing like connectedcomponents filters. In most cases, it is noteworthy that surface congruence between model prediction and manual ground truth was very high, with mean surface distances on the order on 0.02 mm, and with very few cases of surface distances above 0.03 mm. This is also reflected in the form of visual agreement between ground truth and prediction, as visible in two cases in Figures 6A,B. ",

During training, various image augmentation techniques were used to account for expected variations in out-of-sample datasets, such as image contrast and intensity, noise, or affine/deformable distortions of geometry. The training dataset was constructed through atlas-based pre-segmentations with comparatively minor manual correction and segmentation effort (aim i). As a result, the inferred IE-Vnet segmentations on four testing datasets were free from side bias and robust to various domain shift sources, such as MRI scanner hardware and sequences and patient pathology (aim ii). Compared to atlasbased segmentation, the novel model was roughly 2,000 times faster and managed to avoid gross mis-segmentations in more than 20% of test cases, especially in high-volume datasets. In the following, IE-Vnet, compared to currently available neural network algorithms used for MR inner ear segmentation, its technical and clinical implications, methodical limitations, and future work will be discussed.",

This effect can be attributed to the fact that the TFS ground-truth regions were manually refined in every test sample with considerably more effort than the training set. Nevertheless, these indicate accurate segmentation (31) , especially in structures like the semi-circular canals, where the Dice metric is known to degrade quickly for small regions or regions with fine-grained protrusions (68) . Furthermore, the overall low surface distance of 0.02 mm can be attributed to the fact that the volumes were bi-cubically upsampled to a resolution of 0.2 mm before inference. Therefore, Another example of a highly accurate segmentation. The arrow denotes a location with hypo-intense semi-circular canal voxels, as marked manually in red, and the model prediction predicts a thinning at the same location.

LS was 5/5 for cochlea, sacculus, utriculus, posterior and horizontal SCC, and 2/5 for anterior SCC. Visual inspection reveals two isolated blobs, which could be removed with simple post-processing, such as connected components analysis and removal of small islands. (D) A failure case. Notably, manual ground-truth creation in this sample was challenging as well. LS was 5/5 for utriculus and anterior SCC, 4/5 for cochlea and sacculus, 2/5 for horizontal SCC, and 1/5 for posterior SCC. Low-contrast and high noise in SPACE sequences, with further potential challenges like motion artifacts, can lead to irregular ground-truth contours (left arrow) or unusually thin semi-circular canal segments (middle and right arrow).",

Furthermore, the results from our statistical analyses on Dice overlap in both inner ears imply the models freedom from side bias. Further, Dice overlap comparisons (group-and pair-wise) across the four testing datasets show no measurable difference in segmentation performance, indicating that the trained network is robust to variations in scanner hardware, image sequence parameters, and population characteristics. When discussing generalization, it is important to also consider whether quantitative metrics are sufficient to obtain trustworthy and interpretable results. A recent study (69) on chest X-ray classification for computeraided diagnosis of COVID-19 cases has shown that it is vital to incorporate expert validation into the validation of results. Otherwise, it is possible that AI models learn to classify disease statuses based on confounding factors, rather than based on true pathology image content. In particular, image segmentation suffers less from the danger of spurious correlations than image classification: the segmentation output can be overlaid with the source image, and the model predictions become inherently interpretable. However, apart from quantitative metrics like Dice overlap score, or Hausdorff surface distance, a model validation can benefit from additional, expert-based qualitative ratings of the segmentation result. Hence, a differentiated Likert scale rating for the different inner ear structures (cochlea, sacculus, utriculus, anterior, posterior and horizontal semi-circular canal) was incorporated and obtained further insight into the model's performance. In particular, a performance pattern became evident in which, in decreasing order, the most robust results were found in the vestibulum (sacculus, utriculus), while cochlea and posterior SCC performed moderately well. Horizontal SCC and anterior SCC were most susceptible to segmentation errors.",

The average segmentation time for inner ears was 377.0 \u00b1 36.9 s using deformable registration. In total, the segmentation was about 2,000 times faster than a state-of-the-art atlas-based method. However, atlas registration is computed on the CPU, while the inference is fully GPU accelerated; hence the comparison is not entirely fair. It is worth noting that GPU-accelerated deformable registration libraries were introduced recently with speedups in the order of 10-100 times (70) . Moreover, deep models for deformable (71) and diffeomorphic (72) image registration were recently proposed, allowing for registration times comparable to those of our model. However, deep models for registration are trained with dataset sizes in the order of a few thousand sample volumes (71, 72) . Furthermore, atlas-based registration was less robust than IE-Vnet segmentation, as all test dataset volumes required manual correction after atlas pre-segmentation. Hence, our IE-Vnet model was not only trained on TFS contours obtained from registration. Instead, our segmentation model learned patient-wise adaptations, including individual thresholdbased refinements and entire manual corrections of atlas autosegmentations. Patient-specific prediction of the TFS contour, along with the fast inference in the order of milliseconds, makes deep convolutional network models like IE-Vnet attractive for large-scale studies in clinical and neuroscientific imaging-based studies of the inner ear.",

This tool should prove helpful to make ELH classifications (4, 5, 8, 9) more objective and comparable for clinical radiologists during the diagnostic assessment. For research purposes, ELH classification and 2D-or 3D-quantification methods were reliable and valuable for diagnosing endolymphatic hydrops (25) . However, the reliability increases from ELH classification to 2D-and again to 3D-quantification methods (10) . A model for complete 3D segmentation of TFS, including semi-circular canals (SCC), not only enables 3D volumetric analyses but gives it a substantially wider application area, e.g., IE surgical planning.",

Compared to IE-Vnet, IE-Unet does not need to localize the inner ears in a separate pre-processing step. On the other hand, IE-Vnet operates at a more than twice higher resolution (0.2 mm isotropic vs. 0.45 mm), which leads to smoother surface boundaries of the output segmentation and can better deal with partial volume effects due to low voxel resolution in MRI.",

            "text": "There are methodical limitations in the current study that need to be considered in interpreting the data. One limitation of IE-Vnet in its current form is its reliance on a pre-localization and cropping of a cubical inner ear ROI obtained via deformable registration of the FHT and a transfer of the inner ear annotations. Their computational time was not considered in the discussion since both IE-Vnet, and the IET atlas-segmentation assume a previous localization and ROI cropping of the inner ear. The pre-processing steps are limited to localizing the left and right inner ear in the present work. This can be achieved fully automatically using a full-head registration and requires no manual interaction (other than, e.g., a post-registration visual inspection of whether the cropped ROI indeed contains the inner ear). In the current study, inner ear localization was successful for all 100% of inner ears. This can be achieved fully automatically using a full-head registration and requires no manual interaction (other than e.g., a post-registration visual inspection whether the cropped ROI indeed contains the inner ear). In this study, inner ear localization was successful for all 100% of inner ears. Given that IE-Vnet is trained to be robust toward a localization uncertainty of \u223c1 cm (cf. augmentations in Section 2.5.2) this registration can be parametrized at a reasonably low resolution (e.g., deformation fields at 5 mm resolution). Consequently, in our study, inner ear localization via deformable registration was comparatively fast and took 25 s for both inner ears of each subject on a commodity laptop with 4a CPU. Alternatively, the inner ears can also be manually localized using landmark annotation. Depending on the workstation hardware and registration parametrization, a fully automatic inner ear ROI localization could be performed in 1-2 min. A manual localization is much faster and requires two clicks, which can be performed in the order of seconds. However, it would be attractive to incorporate this step into the deep learning architecture itself, either via a cascaded setup of two networks (83), one for ROI localization and one for segmentation (IE-Vnet), or via a sliding-window inference approach (84) . Both approaches are exciting avenues for future work. Another issue is that rare cases with strong artifacts can still lead to mis-segmentations (e.g., Figure 6D) . However, such cases are statistically rare (long-tail problem) and challenging to solve. Instead, prior knowledge of the shape and topology of the inner ears TFS could be incorporated into the regularization model, e.g., through statistical shape models (85, 86) .",

A tilt of the SVV is a sensitive sign of a graviceptive vestibular tone imbalance. SVV was assessed when sitting in an upright position in front of a half-spherical dome with the head fixed on a chin rest (87) . A mean deviation of > 2.5 from the true vertical was considered a pathological tilt of SVV (87) . The impairment of vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) in higher frequencies was measured by using highframe-rate VOG with EyeSeeCam ((88), EyeSeeTech, Munich, Germany). A median gain during head impulses < 0.6 (eye velocity in \u2022 /s divided by head velocity in \u2022 /s) was considered a pathological VOR (89) . Furthermore, horizontal semicircular canal responsiveness in lower frequencies was assessed by caloric testing with VOG. This was done for both ears with 30 \u2022 C cold and 44 \u2022 C warm water. Vestibular paresis was defined as >25% asymmetry between the right-and left-sided responses (90) .",

INHEARIT offers an automatic 2D area ELH (endolymphatic hydrops) ratio segmentation customized to the needs of a clinical radiologist, while IE-Vnet and IE-Unet enable 3D volumetric TFS segmentation with broad usability. The comparison considers a) parameters of the training and testing of the models, as well as their b) performance. IE-Vnet and Unet represent a similar approach to the same problem and can be complementary.
