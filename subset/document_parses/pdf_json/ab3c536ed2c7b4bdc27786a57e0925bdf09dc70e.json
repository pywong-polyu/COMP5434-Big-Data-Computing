A major limitation in the delivery of telemedicine remains the difficulty that many doctors and care providers experience with being able to conduct adequate visual assessments of patient wounds remotely [2] . Currently, standard telehealth practice involves patients using their smartphones to transmit photographs of their wounds through direct messaging services to their care provider; such images are often poorly calibrated for size, color, and lighting, not to mention the lack of security using such an approach. Wound-related information is either communicated over telephone or through text messages, which suffers from a lack of standardization of descriptors for issues such as pain and presence of exudate. Therefore, for remote care delivery to match the level received through in-person appointments, there is an urgent need for patients to be able to easily capture high-quality images of their wounds, that also contains high-quality information content which can be securely shared.",

            "text": "Healthcare apps are specially designed applications for smartphones with health-oriented functionality [2] . By one estimate, over 318 000 health-related apps are available for download [3] . The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) defines software functions such as those found in mobile medical apps as \"device software functions\" (https://www.fda.gov/media/80958/ download). In addition, to assist with adhering to relevant design, best practices, and usage considerations, the World Health Organization (WHO) has published guidelines on digital health interventions (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/ NBK541905/). Evidence from 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic suggests it played a pivotal role in the widespread implementation of digital technologies in healthcare [4] . We previously developed a mobile app and dashboard (Swift\u2122 Skin and Wound) specifically designed to accurately and reliably measure and document many aspects of wounds [5] ( Figure 1A-1D) . The system, which is registered as a clinical device with Health Canada (https://health-products.canada. ca/mdall-limh/dispatch-repartition.do?type=active) and the US FDA (https://fda.report/Company/Swift-Medical-Inc), uses machine-vision technology to automatically focus and calculate wound dimensions from images acquired by a smartphone's camera, allowing users to obtain precise and consistent measurements. These capabilities have been demonstrated to reduce the time needed for and increase accuracy of patient wound assessments compared with the traditional paperand-ruler method [6] . In response to the increased reliance on remote appointments brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic [7] , we have recently developed a stream-lined, patient-facing version of the app (Patient Connect, Figure 2A , 2B), designed for use by patients and/or their care providers using their own personal smartphones. In addition to being able to view a wound's image series over time, additional information such as healing-associated metrics, wound-bed information, anatomical location, and patient identifiers can be viewed. We report the case of a patient with diabetes and multiple episodes of foot infections who was successfully managed using this app during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020-2021. As well as reporting on their experiences, we present evidence demonstrating the app's effectiveness in both remote care management and delivery.",

A bone and PET scan showed resolution of osteomyelitis, with soft-tissue inflammation. He was treated with another course of oral antibiotics (amoxicillin-clavulanate and ciprofloxacin). At this point, the patient agreed to download and use the Swift Medical Patient Connect App to capture and share images of the wound (Figure 3B-3D) . As of January 2021, the patient had 7 additional telemedicine appointments and submitted a total of 39 images through the app, an almost 20-fold increase in sharing wound-related data compared to the situation before using the app. The wound gradually improved over this time, with objective decrease in size as measured by the app (Figure 3E) . The patient subsequently developed 2 additional wounds in different locations and was followed again via the app, with ongoing use as of September 2021. Throughout a 1-year period as part of telehealth care, the app permitted the longitudinal monitoring and successful management of 3 infection episodes in a high-risk patient.",

Use of the app therefore reduced anxiety through reduced healthcare contact and surrounding risk of hospital-associated COVID-19 exposure.

Total time and financial commitment from the patient per appointment averaged 3 hours and approximately $50 CAD, respectively: remote appointments eliminated both of these costs. For the physician, use of the Patient Connect App as part of the remote care strategy deployed resulted in a substantial time saving: the standard workflow ordinarily required to visually assess the wound, including positioning, dressing removal, and cleansing, was eliminated. The physician estimated that this reduced the time required from 30 to 15 minutes: if this modality were widely adopted, this would potentially allow twice the number of patients to be seen. In addition, the patient captured photos during visits by a local community service centre nurse who performed his routine dressing changes. As regular dressing changes remain an essential part of wound care, whether delivered in-person or remotely, the ease of imaging the wound as part of routine wound care in a standardized manner represented another time-saving factor.",

Access to the Patient Connect App is provided through a health care provider that has access to the Swift Medical solution through a licensing agreement; the Patient Connect App itself is free and there is no charge to the patient or caregiver using the app. The virtual appointments had no upfront cost for the patient, and the physician was remunerated for virtual visits via the healthcare system, similar to in-person visits, through a separate billing code.",

The patient found the app \"educational and empowering\", consistent with an earlier study on patient wound-perception [8] . This observation is also consistent with a recent study describing the use of an mHealth tool facilitating remote assessment of digital ulcers, resulting in high levels of patient satisfaction [9] . Possession of and familiarity with a smartphone is an obvious pre-requisite for using this technology, but given their ubiquity, we do not envision this being a significant limitation. Presently, the Patient Connect App is being used in addition to other care practices, including telephone calls and in-person visits, which remain essential in the care of patients with wounds. If the app were to completely substitute for in-person visits, a major concern remains whether complications might be missed or wounds mis-diagnosed, resulting in administration of inappropriate treatments. Therefore, more research is required to determine if this innovation can provide a level of patient care comparable to standard care/ in-person appointments.",

However, the lack of consistent imaging regarding scale, focus, and lightning conditions has been tied to relatively low inter-and intra-observer reliability in the diagnosis of DFU complications based on mobile phone imaging [13] . Another systematic review [14] found that the use of mobile applications for monitoring DFUs led to increased community support and wound care knowledge, and helped empower patients.

Prior to using the app, despite being able to directly contact the physician, the present patient considered sending images a potential imposition on the physician. The patient also felt uncomfortable that images would be sent via standard messaging and stored on the physician's smartphone. In contrast, by storing images captured using the app on secure cloudbased servers, this reduced the patient's anxiety about sharing images and facilitated the physician's ability to rapidly and securely receive images. In addition, patient identifiers (eg, name and unit number) are accessible through the secure dashboard, and treatment advice and care-related communications can be provided directly to the patient using the app. The Michener Institute; University Health Network) throughout Quebec and Ontario. In addition, the Patient Connect App has recently been licensed to a national health care system in the US, with the contract able to support up to 10 000 patients, which will ensure its impact in the short-to-medium term. Studies are underway to more rigorously determine the extent of time savings made through use of the app (eg, average number of days lost due to unplanned hospital admissions) and to investigate whether use of the app as part of a remote wound care strategy can deliver care comparable to or better than standard care/in-person appointments.",

The use of an innovative patient-facing smart phone app designed to monitor and manage wounds by a patient with diabetes and foot ulcer resulted in numerous benefits. After initial adoption, 3 successive wounds were managed with a combination of in-person and telehealth visits complemented by the app. Incorporation of this technology as part of a novel telemedicine strategy promises to have an extensive impact on remote care delivery, during the current COVID-19 pandemic and beyond.",
