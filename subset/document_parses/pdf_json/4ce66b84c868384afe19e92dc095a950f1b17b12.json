The effective drug target among coronaviruses is the main protease M pro , because of its essential role in processing the polyproteins that are translated from the viral RNA. In this study, the bioactivity of some selected heterocyclic drugs named Favipiravir (1), Amodiaquine (2), 2 -Fluoro-2 -deoxycytidine (3), and Ribavirin (4) was evaluated as inhibitors and nucleotide analogues for COVID-19 using computational modeling strategies. The density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed to estimate the thermal parameters, dipole moment, polarizability, and molecular electrostatic potential of the present drugs; additionally, Mulliken atomic charges of the drugs as well as the chemical reactivity descriptors were investigated. The nominated drugs were docked on SARS-CoV-2 main protease (PDB: 6LU7) to evaluate the binding affinity of these drugs. Besides, the computations data of DFT the docking simulation studies was predicted that the Amodiaquine (2) has the least binding energy (\u22127.77 Kcal/mol) and might serve as a good inhibitor to SARS-CoV-2 comparable with the approved medicines, hydroxychloroquine, and remdesivir which have binding affinity \u22126.06 and \u22124.96 Kcal/mol, respectively. The high binding affinity of 2 was attributed to the presence of three hydrogen bonds along with different hydrophobic interactions between the drug and the critical amino acids residues of the receptor. Finally, the estimated molecular electrostatic potential results by DFT were used to illustrate the molecular docking findings. The DFT calculations showed that drug 2 has the highest of lying HOMO, electrophilicity index, basicity, and dipole moment. All these parameters could share with different extent to significantly affect the binding affinity of these drugs with the active protein sites.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}, {"text": "it is round in shape or crown-shaped and has a diameter of \u2248 60-140 nm, as per observations under the electron microscopy [3] . The incubation period of COVID-19 ranges from 2 to 14 days. According to the World Health Organization, there have been around 1 million and 550 thousand reported cases of COVID-19 disease and more than 90,000 reported deaths to date (11/04/2020). Moreover, SARS-COV-2, the big family of COVID-19, is sensitive to heat and ultraviolet (UV) rays. Furthermore, they are inactivated at 56 \u2022 C for half hour and can be stored at \u221280 \u2022 C for many years. Additionally, 75% ethanol, chlorine containing disinfectants and peracetic acid can effectively inactivate . In general, the major principle to prevent and control the infectious disease is eliminating the source of infections thereby protecting the very sensitive population [5] . The hydroxychloroquine an approved drug for malaria disease by FDA was explored as a medication for SARS-CoV-2 [6,7]. Previous reports revealed that, the chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine can inhibit the coronavirus (COVID-19) by changing the pH at the surface of the cell membrane. This action can inhibit the attachment of the virus to the cell membrane. In addition, it can prevent nucleic acid replication, glycosylation of viral proteins, virus assembly, new virus particle delivery, virus release, and other mechanisms to obtain its antiviral effects [8] . Remdesivir, Ebola's medication [9] demonstrated activity against the coronavirus family in 2017 and 2020 [10, 11] . To date, there are no SARS-CoV-2 vaccines available, however several domestic and foreign research institutions and enterprises have used several methods, including mRNA nano-vaccine technology, recombinant or inactivated vaccine technology, and DNA vaccine technology, to develop coronavirus vaccine [5] .

On the other hand, DFT calculations of the frontier molecular orbitals to make a comparison between the energy level of HOMO and LUMO as well as with their energy gap of the investigated drugs showed their impact on the bioactivity of these compounds. The energy levels of HOMOs are between \u22125.65 eV to \u22127.61 eV, however, the LUMO are in between \u22121.05 to 5.47 eV depending on the conjugation as well as the nature of substituents around the nucleus. Further, the order of the FMOs energy gap was 2.14, 4.00, 5.28, and 5.54 for 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively. It is clear that, the drug 2 of the high lying HOMO is the most susceptible to be electron donor.

The results of the docking studies aimed at studying the binding mode of these drugs to the SARS-CoV 3CLpro. The results revealed that amodiaquine (2) and ribavirin (4) showed the best affinity with the target receptor, even though this behavior was not experimentally verified. It was predicted that the amodiaquine showed the lowest binding energy (\u22127.77 Kcal/mol) with respect to the other drugs. Moreover, amodiaquine binding affinity is lower than that of the approved medicines, hydroxychloroquine and remdesivir which have binding affinity \u22126.06 and \u22124.96 Kcal/mol; respectively. The results of the molecular docking have been illustrated in terms of the DFT calculations. The DFT results showed that amodiaquine (2) is the most lying HOMO, and consequently it could be the best to act as an electron donor. Moreover, the most electrophilic centers of the drug 2 are N 11 , N 31 , and O 29 and this could be attributed to the presence of the lone pair of electrons on these atoms. Further, the \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking could be another hydrophobic interaction between the drug and the receptors. Additionally, a high basicity (\u03c7 = 3.70) and dipole moment (\u00b5 = 14.4 Debye) of drug 2 rather than the others, could be the other factors that enhanced the extent of the binding affinity. It could be concluded that these parameters share together with different magnitudes and affect the degree of the binding affinity of these drugs with the active protein sites to afford a certain degree of inhibition. Finally, from these in silico studies for drug 2, it is very promising to perform further in vitro and small animal model in vivo studies to establish a solid experimental evidence of its activity as inhibitors for COVID-19.
