Outbreaks in LTCFs are associated with inadequate ventilation systems increasing the risk of airborne SARS-CoV-2 transmission [5] , while significant shortages in testing supplies and personal protective equipment (PPE), as well as staffing constraints, have further exacerbated the detrimental impact of COVID-19 on this population [6, 7] .",

Existing studies on COVID-19 outbreaks in the institutionalized elderly largely focus on epidemiological characteristics [9] [10] [11] [12] and clinical symptoms related to initial presentation and transmission [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] . Few studies assessed the clinical course and past initial symptom status of residents, as it relates to mortality outcomes [19] [20] [21] , especially in a non-hospital setting [22, 23] , with an infection and mortality rate as high as those documented here. In this study, we report a COVID-19 outbreak among 116 residents of a nursing home with a very high infection and mortality rates, with a specific focus on the clinical presentation and characteristics associated with mortality.",

Compared to the survival group, infection in those who expired was more likely to begin with lethargy and loss of appetite, symptoms that persisted during the whole illness course. Clinical decline was often sudden and unexplained, with deaths occurring soon after the initial symptoms. Importantly, prevalence of initial atypical symptoms had serious implications for clinical decision making, specifically in early consideration of COVID-19 testing and application of the infection protocol, given the rapid clinical decline witnessed in the deceased group.",

In light of reports describing coagulopathy in severe COVID-19 disease, prophylactic anticoagulation therapy was given to 63.1% residents (70/111 residents), on average 9.5 days after their first positive test. Residents receiving prophylactic anticoagulation were 84% less likely to die compared to those who did not take any anticoagulation. Due to the small numbers taking anticoagulation other than enoxaparin, conclusions regarding differences in the impact of specific anticoagulants could not be made. Current evidence for use of prophylactic anticoagulation in COVID-19 patients is predominantly based on observational studies of inpatient populations [29] , though incidence of pulmonary embolism even in non-hospitalized asymptomatic COVID-19 patients without other predisposing factors for thrombosis suggests that even outpatients could potentially benefit from anticoagulation [30, 31] . We found only one anticoagulation study in the LTCF population, a retrospective multi-center case series of 101 Dutch nursing home residents, that reported no significant evidence of mortality benefit with use of oral antithrombotic therapy [32] . Further studies are needed to characterize the benefit of prophylactic anticoagulation in outpatient settings, like LTCFs.",

It is interesting to note that the first confirmed case of COVID-19 in the facility was in an asymptomatic staff member. While the facility itself was able to implement strict mitigation policies, including restriction of visitors, staff were routinely coming in from the community. Furthermore, staff members might be more likely to present as asymptomatic cases than nursing home residents [13, 33, 34] . While analysis of staff transmission was beyond the scope of this study, staff infection was identified as a strong risk factor for resident mortality, alongside a temporal relationship that suggests residents were infected by staff [35] . Specific nursing home characteristics might factor into the infection rate as well. Poorly ventilated buildings were implicated in a study of a COVID-19 outbreak in a Dutch nursing home [5, 36] . Studies of nursing home quality metrics also found a relationship between lower Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services' (CMS) star quality ratings, specifically staffing deficiencies and for-profit ownership status of nursing homes, and COVID-19 outbreak risk and severity [37] [38] [39] [40] .",

Less attention was paid to the clinical patterns of COVID-19 in LTCF residents, as it relates to mortality outcomes, and those that did were not in exclusively outpatient settings [22, 23] . The unique combination of a congregate outpatient setting, staff interaction, and resident characteristics suggests differences in exposure, illness course, and risk of sequelae like venous thromboembolisms, when compared to hospitalized or community-dwelling patients [35] . Remdesivir, currently the only FDA-approved treatment for COVID-19, is not an option in outpatient settings. Characterization of the clinical picture relating to the outcomes in the outpatient LTCF population is important for the discussion of treatment guidelines for this health care setting. Ongoing efforts by the scientific community should be made to better address treatment options for COVID-19 in LTCF residents, in light of the morbidity and mortality burden upon this specific population.",
