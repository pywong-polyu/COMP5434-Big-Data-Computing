Proteins are powerful tools to predict infectious disease progression such as COVID-19. The main methodology used to COVID-19 detection is based on ELISA test by antibodies detection assays targeting SARS-CoV-2 virus spike protein and nucleocapside protein that represent an indirect SARS-CoV-2 detection with low sentitivy and specificity. Moreover ELISA test are limited to used external shaker to obtain homogenously immobilization of antibodies and protein on sensing platform. Here, we present magnetic microrobots that collective self-assembly through immuno-sandwich assay and they can be used as mobile platform to detect on-the-fly SARS-CoV-2 virus particle by its spike protein. The collective self-assembly of magnetic microrobots through immuno-sandwich assay enhanced its analytical performance in terms of sensitivity decreasing the detection limit of SARS-CoV-2 virus by one order of magnitude with respect to the devices previously reported. This proof-of-concept of microrobotics offer new ways to the detection of viruses and proteins of medical interest in general.",

Depending on the material that comprises a micro/nanorobot, bioreceptors such as enzymes, antibodies, aptamers, DNA, and RNA can be immobilized on its surface [2, 3, [7] [8] [9] . The chemistry on-the-fly that micro/nanorobots can be performed, can facilitate the isolation of specific targets even in complex biosamples, avoiding several washing and mixing procedures that require external shakers and centrifuges. Micro/nanorobots are machines that can be propelled by an external stimulus (e.g., light and magnetic/ultrasound fields) [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] or by chemical fuels such as H 2 O 2 , urea, etc ., [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] thereby providing enhanced diffusion and mixing.",

For this purpose, MagRobots were modified with antibody against SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (SP), see (i) Scheme 1 . That will be termed in this work as MagRobot@anti-SARS-CoV-2 SP. MagRobot@anti-SARS-CoV-2 SP were used as a mobile platform for the capture of SARS-CoV-2 virus particle and labelled secondary antibody see (iii) Scheme 1 . Interestingly, when the immuno-sandwich assay was formed by applied transversal rotating magnetic field, MagRobots were self-assembled and form 3D-staggered chains (see (iv) Scheme 1 ), while in absence of immuno-sandwich assay, individual or linear chains of MagRobots were observed. This collective self-assembly behavior improves the performance of MagRobots since they walk across a larger area in less time as well as they moved with greater force. In consequence, this collective self-assembly behavior may be responsible for the improvement of its sensitivity by decreasing the detection limit of SARS-CoV-2 virus by an order of magnitude with respect to the device previously reported by Seo et al. [28] .",

The STEM and STEM high-angle dark-field retractable (STEM-HADF) micrographs ( Fig. 2 A and 2 B ) show uniform size and shape distribution of Ag-AuNRs, whereas EDS elemental mapping from the SEM image show that Ag-AuNRs have a uniform silver outer layer with a uniform gold core ( Fig. 2 C ) . In addition, the size distribution obtained from STEM images reveals homogeneous rectangular-shaped Ag-AuNRs with average length and width of 69.4 \u00b1 9.3 nm and 39 \u00b1 4.9 nm, respectively (see Fig. 2 D ) . Moreover, Ag-AuNRs show an average Ag outside layer thickness of 12.6 \u00b1 2.9 nm. In addition, the ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectrum ( Fig. 3 A ) of Ag-AuNRs is in good agreement with values reported previously, [31] with a particle concentration of 1.1 nM.",

For this aim, magneto immuno-sandwich assay was placed and concentrated on the working electrode (WE) of SP electrode by external magnet placed behind the WE. Then, H 2 SO 4 0.5 M was added, see details in experimental section. Finally, chronoamperogram was recorded for 50 s by applying \u22120.97 V vs. RHE, the onset potential of HER of Ag-AuNRs. Two sets of control experiments were performed to evaluate the performance of the magnetic immuno-sandwich assay developed here. The first control experiment was performed in conventional conditions to prepare the magnetic immunosandwich assay using external shaking and the second one was performed in static mode; both controls were compared with the mobile mode. The recorded current from HER catalysis of all experiments were compared in Fig. 4 A . Clearly, the enhanced current intensity was observed in MagRobots propelled under transversal rotating magnetic field using programed automated motion mode (see red column, dynamic). In addition, low current intensity were observed when external shaker was used (see blue column), and the lowest current intensity was observed in static mode (yellow column). The incubation time used was 30 min to be comparable with the MagRobot in dynamic mode. In all experiment 500 ng/mL SARS-CoV-2 spike protein was used. According to One-Way ANOVA test statistical analysis with a confidence interval of 95%, the mean values for immune-sandwich assay of SARS-Cov-2 SP prepared in static and dynamic modes as well as using external shakers were statistically different with p = 0.0 0 0 04. The plausible reason, that dynamic mode is more efficient to external shaker is because antibodies can aggregated under shaking producing mechanical stress on them [41] . Moreover, we have observed that MagRobots partially precipitate to the bottom of test tube under shaker mode.",
