Obesity has been treated for centuries focused-on weight loss while other treatments on associated conditions like gout, diabetes (T2D), and hypertriglyceridemia. To date, there is no systematic review that synthesizes the origin of obesity clinics in Mexico and the efforts to investigate treatments for obesity tested by randomized clinical trials (RCT). We conducted systematic searches in Pubmed, Scopus, and Web of Science to retrieve anti-obesity RCT through 2019 and without an inferior temporal limit. The systematic review included RCT of anti-obesity treatments in the Mexican adult population, covering alternative medicine, pharmacological, nutritional, behavioral, and surgical interventions reporting metabolism-associated traits such as Garcia-Oropesa et al.",

Only the studies with at least 3 months of treatment were included in the meta-analyses in order to reduce placebo effects. We found 634 entries, after removal of duplicates and screening the studies based on eligibility criteria, we analyzed 43 national, and 2 multinational-collaborative studies. Most of the national studies had small sample sizes, and the implemented strategies do not have replications in the population. The nutrition/behavioral interventions were difficult to blind, and most studies have medium-to-high risk of bias. Nutritional/behavioral interventions and medications showed effects on BMI, waist circumference, and blood pressure. Simple measures like pure water instead of sweet beverages decrease triglycerides and systolic blood pressure. Dark chocolate showed the highest effect for BMI and high blood pressure, and treatment with insulin increased weight in those with T2D. The study of obesity in Mexico has been on-going for more than four decades, the interest on RCT just increased until this millennium, but with small sample sizes and lack of replication. The interventions affect different cardiometabolic associated traits, which should be analyzed in detail in the population living near the Mexico-U.S. border; therefore, bi-national collaboration is desirable to disentangle the cultural effects on this population's treatment response.",

The first National Survey on Chronic Diseases (ENEC from Spanish: Encuesta Nacional de Enfermedades Cr\u00f3nicas) highlighted obesity as a national public health problem. The prevalence of obesity in Mexico has increased substantially since the 1980s, and currently affects over 30% of the adult population (3) . The epidemiological transition from undernourishment and infectious diseases to emergent chronic diseases were well-documented in the ENEC. A sequel of undernourishment in presence of an obesogenic environment is homeorrhexis as an adaptive response to undernourishment. Homeorrexis or homeorhesis comes from the Greek hom\u00f3s, \"equal;\" and rh\u00e9xis, \"violent rupture, \" and refers to regulatory mechanisms that allow the body to change from one homeostatic, stable condition to another in a programmed fashion, e.g., growth during childhood or the onset of lactation (4) . A combination of genetic and socioeconomic strata were conditions affecting stature. From North to South Mexico the ENEC data show a decrease in stature by expenses of the lower body segment (Figure 1) , the sitting height is almost similar across regions. The stature can modify body composition despite BMI (5) and can be an indicator of socioeconomic inequality (6) .",

In 2008 the import tariffs on maize, bean, sugar, and mill were eliminated. In response to the nutritional problems and increase in obesity, in 2010 the Ministries of Public Education and of Health published the General Guidelines for Dispensing or Distribution of Foods and Beverages at School Food Establishments (SFEs).

Our analysis was limited to randomized clinical studies conducted in Mexico or from international multicentric studies with Mexican participants involving nutrition, behavior, medication, or alternative medicine interventions. Some interventions of interest were compared with another active strategy (medication, behavior, physical activity or any other than placebo). This strategy can blunt the effect size of the intervention, because of the effect of active comparators in metabolic and anthropometric variables. We found that all studied interventions were better than placebo, or better than the selected comparator, and many of the published papers made individual paired contrasts between final and basal values. However, we decided to contrast treatments and reported the size of effects by cardiometabolic risk traits. With this strategy we had the advantage of computing the effect size over a maneuver the researchers considered the best comparator. The results should be interpreted considering these control groups defined by the researchers.",

Surgical procedures were 72, while alternative treatments included 235 individuals. We obtained a total of 4,155 participants from these trials. The nutritional/behavioral strategies included supplemental, flavonoids, manipulation of macronutrient content diets (low fat, low carb, high protein) with caloric restriction, water consumption and physical activities. CBT combined with a low-calorie diet showed beneficial effects on BMI and waist circumference while combined with a low-fat diet decreased glucose and triglycerides. A cardioprotective structured hypocaloric diet is more effective than the CBT approach in reducing metabolic syndrome (54) . Daily flavonoid-rich chocolate (70% cocoa) intake improves fasting plasma glucose levels and insulin resistance parameter (HOMA-IR) and the lipid and glucose metabolism (41) . The physical activity showed benefic but small and non-significant effects for the analyzed variables, due to the lack of enough sample size. Other systematic reviews focused on physical activity showed Hispanics had less leisure-time compared with other groups in the U.S., the most common activity was walking, but the most significant results were those with moderate to vigorous physical activity (67) . It will be crucial to increase legislative policies to build environments that increase available opportunities for physical activities, particularly for this fast-growing population group.",

(46) the diastolic and systolic blood pressure were significantly different between the studied low fat milk groups compared with controls. Some surgical studies for weight loss made in the Instituto de Nutrici\u00f3n Salvador Zubir\u00e1n in Mexico City blinded the abdominal wall for patients and evaluators when they compared the open abdominal approach vs. the laparoscopic method.
