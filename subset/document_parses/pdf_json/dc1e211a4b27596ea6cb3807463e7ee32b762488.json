This approach is dependent on the detection and quantification of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in untreated/raw wastewater. However, the quantification of the viral RNA could be influenced by the physico-chemical properties of the wastewater. This study presents the first use of Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) to determine the potential impact of physico-chemical characteristics of wastewater on the detection and concentration of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater. Raw wastewater samples from four wastewater treatment plants were investigated over four months. The physico-chemical characteristics of the raw wastewater was recorded, and the SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentration determined via amplification with droplet digital polymerase chain reaction. The wastewater characteristics considered were chemical oxygen demand, flow rate, ammonia, pH, permanganate value, and total solids. The mean SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrations ranged from 648.1(\u00b1514.6) copies/mL to 1441.0 (\u00b11977.8) copies/mL. Among the parameters assessed using the ANFIS model, ammonia and pH showed significant association with the concentration of SARS-CoV-2 RNA measured. Increasing ammonia concentration was associated with increasing viral RNA concentration and pH between 7.1 and 7.4 were associated with the highest SARS-CoV-2 concentration. Other parameters, such as total solids, were also observed to influence the viral RNA concentration, however, this observation was not consistent across all the wastewater treatment plants. The results from this study indicate the importance of incorporating wastewater characteristic assessment into wastewater-based epidemiology for a robust and accurate COVID-19 surveillance.",

The SARS-CoV-2 virus particle (the virion) consists of the nucleic acid encapsulated in an outer protein coat called the capsid and a lipid envelope . This coronavirus virion has glycoprotein spikes on the outer surface, with which it neutralises antibody, attaches and enters a host (Ou et al., 2020) . The SARS-CoV-2 is majorly a respiratory pathogen, and mainly spread from person-to-person via direct or indirect contact between people Sommerstein et al., 2020; Rabaan et al., 2021) .

The clinical-based surveillance and screening has been limited by cost, turnaround time and possible underestimation of the severity of the infection spread occasioned by asymptomatic COVID-19 cases (Olga and Halden 2020; Lodder and de Roda Husman. 2020); Randazzo et al., 2020) . It has been shown by various researchers that the SARS-CoV-2 genetic markers in the untreated/raw wastewater can be used to track infection rate within the wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) catchment of the community in real time Ahmed et al., 2020a Ahmed et al., , 2020b Graham et al., 2020; Peccia et al., 2020; . This method captures the totality of symptomatic, pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic carriers within specific community, which is usually not the case with clinical surveillance Bivins et al., 2020) . The incorporation of population normalization to the wastewater-based epidemiology data provides the additional opportunity for determination of patterns, trends and possible comparison across catchments with different population sizes, ultimately helping in infection hotspot identification (Medema et al., 2020a (Medema et al., , 2020b .",

            "text": "Different authors have employed the wastewater-based epidemiology approach for COVID-19 surveillance around the globe with some level of success achieved. However, there are still challenges to overcome for this approach to become more useful and widely acceptable. Viruses are generally susceptible to inactivation once released into the environment and factors including temperature, UV light, pH, inorganic cations and anions, antagonistic microbial interaction, among others can have virucidal effect on these viral particles (Joiner et al., 2020; Auffret et al., 2019) . The wastewater environment is a complex matrix with different components that can affect the stability of virus. Enteric viruses are known to be more resistant to environmental factors and tend to survive longer than enveloped viruses (Hurst and Gerba, 1989) . Gundy at al. (2009) noted that the Human coronavirus (HCoV-229 E), a causative agent of common cold could survive in wastewater up to 2-4 days under optimal conditions. They also noted that coronaviruses inactivation in the test water was highly dependent on temperature, level of organic matter, and presence of antagonistic bacteria. Olga and Halden (2020) also identified temperature, average in-sewer travel time and per-capita water use as key variables that affects SARS-CoV-2 estimation in wastewater. This indicates that the wastewater-based epidemiology approach for SARS-CoV-2 surveillance needs to factor in the impact of the wastewater environment on the stability of the virus. However, there is lack of information on the impact of wastewater characteristics on estimation of SARS-CoV-2 viral load in wastewater. Hence, this study investigated the effect of physico-chemical characteristics of wastewater on the estimation of SARS-CoV-2 for wastewater-based epidemiology.",

In the three WWTPs with a complete set of these two parameters (Central, Darvil and Howick WWTPs), it was observed that the impact varies depending on the WWTP. For instance, in Central WWTP it was observed that the detection of high concentration of SARS-CoV-2 was within three flow rate ranges. These were 40-60 m 3 /day, 64-76 m 3 /day and 88-100 m 3 /day, with COD between 600 and 780 mg/L associated with high viral RNA concentration (Fig. 3A) .

Based on these results (Table 2) , ANFIS modeling showed excellent accuracies in modeling SARS-CoV-2 concentrations for each input scenario. Coefficient of determination (R 2 ) results were mostly greater than 0.9, with superiority to scenario (C) with inputs permanganate value (PV4) and Total solids. However, the modeling errors represented by RMSE and MAE, from lowest to highest, were using inputs scenario (C), (B) and (A), respectively. In general, ANFIS model was capable to simulate the variability in SARS-CoV-2 concentrations using wastewater physico-chemical parameters. Fig. 6 illustrates the RE% results in modeling SARS-CoV-2 concentrations for each inputs scenario as follows: (A) ammonia and pH, (B) Flow rate and COD, and (C) PV4 and Total solids. The range of errors using Flow rate and COD were the widest for some points comparing to other inputs, however, most points located within \u00b150 % as presented in Fig. 6 (B) .

Domestic wastewater generally contain approximately 99.9 % water (Sperling, 2007) , with the remaining 0.1 % comprising of different substances, that are either biological, chemical or physical. These substances have the potential to influence the characteristics of the wastewater. However, in this study there was no observed significant impact of the source of wastewater on the characteristics measured. For instance, the concentration of ammonia, pH and Table 1 Mean concentration (\u00b1standard deviation) of measured physico-chemical characteristics and SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater at the four wastewater treatment plants. WWTP NH 3 (mg/L) pH (pH@25 \u2022 C) COD (mg/L) FR (m 3 /day) TS (mg/L) PV4 SARS-CoV-2 concentration (copies/mL) It also worth noting that sampling was done at time economic activities were either minimal or non-existent due to the COVID-19 lockdown regulations. This could potentially had contributed to low industrial activity, resulting in less wastewater input from the industries. The variations observed in the concentration of SARS-CoV-2 copies between and within the WWTPs could also be attributed to the size of the population served and shedding of the viral particle by infected individuals. For instance, the highest concentration of the viral RNA of 1441.0(\u00b11977.8) copies/mL was detected in Central WWTP (Table 1) , this also happens to be the biggest WWTP, with a designed capacity to treat 80 ML/d. During this study the clinically confirmed active cases of COVID-19 in South Africa was 600 000, with the province of KwaZulu-Natal, were this study was undertaken, reporting over 100 000 cases. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that between 2 and 27 % of COVID-19 patients have diarrhoea (WHO, 2020), resulting in shedding of the virus in feces. With estimated viral loads ranging from 6.3 \u00d7 10 6 to 1.26 \u00d7 10 8 gc/g of feces (Lescure et al., 2020) . Therefore, more infected people commected to a WWTP could potentially lead to higher viral loads in the wastewater. This could be the reason for the high SARS-CoV-2 loads in wastewater from the Central WWTP, which serves a larger population.",

The influence of pH on the concentration of the viral RNA was observed in all WWTPs except Howick WWTP. For instance, it was observed that the highest SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA were associated with pH between 7.1 and 7.4. This could be attributed to impact of pH on the viral particles. pH range between 5 and 7.4 is a stable range for coronaviruses (Casanova et al., 2009; Daniel and Talbot, 1987) . Therefore, the higher SARS-CoV-2 RNA detected in the wastewater, with pH between 7.1 and 7.4, could be attributed to the stability of the viral particle at this range. Furthermore, a recent study by Varbanov et al. (2021) observed that a 10 min exposure of SARS-CoV-2 to pH of 9 or 10 could result in viral load decrease by more than 5 log 10 units. These findings show that at alkaline pH SARS-CoV-2 viral particles could be inactivated, with low pH supporting increased stability. This could be the reason for the observed association of low pH with high SARS-CoV-2 concentrations in the wastewater.",

            "text": "Increasing ammonia concentration was also observed to be associated with increasing concentration of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Ammonia in wastewater could be from several sources, most importantly, human urine. A large proportion of ammonia produced by humans end up in the WWTPs (Lee et al., 2021) . Therefore, the association between increasing ammonia and increasing SARS-CoV-2 concentration could be attributed to increasing shedding of the viral particles by infected individuals in the connected populations. For instance, at Central WWTP, the mean ammonia was 32.5 (\u00b14.7) mg/L, with a range of 22-43 mg/L. Therefore, the ANFIS model was able to show that increasing ammonia could be an indicator of increasing SARS-CoV-2 concentration. Similar trend was observed for all the other WWTPs except Howick WWTP, which could be attributed to the small nature of this WWTP as discussed above. As mentioned previously the size of the population connected to a WWTP could be a major contributory factor to the concentration of SARS-CoV-2 detected in the wastewater. The association of high ammonia with high SARS-CoV-2 concentration therefore shows that when there is an increase in the loading rate at the WWTP, it is associated with increasing viral particles. A larger population within the catchment of the WWTP indicates a potential high load of SAR-CoV-2 in the wastewater.",

            "text": "The association of ammonia and pH with high SARS-CoV-2 concentration was observed in all WWTPs, with the exception of Howick WWTP. This could be attributed to the small nature of the WWTP. For instance, the mean pH at Howick WWTP was 8.6(\u00b11.0), the highest among all the WWTPs. This could be attributed to the impact of alkaline conditions on SARS-CoV-2 stability. For instance, as reported by Varbanov et al. (2021) , pH of 9 could potentially result in a 5 log 10 unit decrease in viral load. Furthermore, the standard deviation of 1.0, shows the high variability in pH at this WWTP. This observation could be due to small nature of the plant, which makes it easily influenced by small changes in wastewater characteristics related to water use. Total solids concentration was also observed to influence SARS-CoV-2 concentration, however to a much lesser extent compared to pH and ammonia. It was observed that increase in total solids correspond to increasing SARS-CoV-2 RNA. This could be attributed to the attachment of the viral particles to solids in the wastewater, implying that more solids may result in higher attachment of the viral particle to the soilds resulting in higher recovery from the wastewater. For instance, For\u00e9s et al. (2021) reported that about 23 % of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater were attached to the soild fraction. Therefore, an increasing total solid concentration could be associated with increasing recovery of SARS-CoV-2 leading to higher viral concentration.",

This has the potential to significantly impact the utility of wastewater-based epidemiology. This study presented the determination of the impact of these wastewater characteristics on SARS-CoV-2 viral concentration in wastewater. The Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) model showed that ammonia, pH and to a lesser extent total solids are the major parameters that could affect the concentration of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater. The highest concentration of SARS-CoV-2 was determined to be associated with low pH between 7.1 and 7.4 and associated with increasing ammonia concentration. In addition to these parameters with an observed association in almost all the WWTPs, we also observed that there are unique characteristics within each WWTP that has an impact on the concentration of the viral RNA detected. This study therefore shows that SARS-CoV-2 concentration in wastewater could be due to the shedding rate in the connected population, as reported in literature and corroborated in this study via the observed association with increasing ammonia concentration. Additionally, we observed that the stability of the viral particle in wastewater could be impacted by pH and solids in the wastewater. This calls for the inclusion of wastewater physico-chemical characteristic assessment in each WWTP, especially during the method optimization stages, to ensure accurate estimation of viral concentration and contribute to the utility of wastewater-based epidemiology for decision-making. Additionally, future studies could also explore more characteristics and the cumulative impact of these different wastewater characteristics on SARS-CoV-2 detection and quantification.",

            "text": "The findings presented in this study are useful for the further development of wastewater-based epidemiology. However, some limitations of the study have been identified and elaborated below; 1. Impact of heat treatment on viral load: Wastewater samples were heat treated prior to concentration and RNA extraction to provide protection to laboratory personnel. However, there are concerns that this heat treatment could reduce the viral load. Therefore, a limitation of the current approach is the possible reduction in SARS-CoV-2 concentration measured due to the impact of the heat treatment process. 2. Grab sampling of wastewater samples: Samples were collected using the grab sampling approach, this could result in different viral load compared to composite sampling approach. The data used in this study was not from a one-time sampling event, therefore by using samples taken over several months from four wastewater treatment plants, the impact of grab sampling is minimized. However, it is worth noting this could potentially impact the results obtained. 3. Limited physico-chemical parameters: The selection of physicochemical characteristics for this study was limited by the available data. The study relied on data collected by the various WWTPs as part of their routine analysis, therefore there is the potential that other parameters may have an impact on SARS-CoV-2 concentration. This is therefore a limitation that needs to be highlighted and considered for future studies.",
