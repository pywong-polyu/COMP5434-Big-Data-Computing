The rapid and global spread of SARS-CoV-2 resulted in the coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Earlier during the pandemic, there were limited genetic viral variations. As millions of people became infected, multiple single amino acid substitutions emerged. Many of these substitutions have no consequences. However, some of the new variants show a greater infection rate, more severe disease, and reduced sensitivity to current prophylaxes and treatments. Of particular importance in SARS-CoV-2 transmission are mutations that occur in the Spike (S) protein, the protein on the viral outer envelope that binds to the human angiotensin-converting enzyme receptor (hACE2). Here, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of 441,168 individual virus sequences isolated from humans throughout the world. From the individual sequences, we identified 3540 unique amino acid substitutions in the S protein. Analysis of these different variants in the S protein pinpointed important functional and structural sites in the protein. This information may guide the development of effective vaccines and therapeutics to help arrest the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic.",

Interaction of SARS-CoV-2 with hACE2 occurs via the Spike (S) protein on the viral envelope. Proteases cleave the S protein into S1 and S2 subunits 2-4 to enable viral binding to hACE2 5 and viral entry by membrane fusion 6 .

            "text": "The SARS-CoV-2 S protein is 1273 amino acids long; it contains a signal peptide (amino acids [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] , the S1 subunit (14-685 residues) that mediates receptor binding, and the S2 subunit (686-1273 residues) that mediates membrane fusion 30 . To identify areas in the S protein that are the least divergent as the virus evolves in humans, we obtained viral sequences from GISAID (Supplementary Table S1 ) that as of March 1, 2021, included 633,137 individual virus sequences isolated from humans throughout the world. As compared with the index WIV04 (MN996528.1, also known as the Wuhan variant or index virus) sequence of February 2020 31 , the 1273 amino acid S protein 8 had 3540 variants. This number of variants only includes filtered sequences (441,168) that are complete and do not contain an abnormal number of mutations (see \"Methods\"). As there are 3540 variants, on average, each position in the 1273 amino acid protein sequence has approximately three variants (Fig. 1d) . However, some regions harbor 9 variants in a single amino acid position whereas others have no variants ( Fig. 1d ; Supplementary Table S3 ). Regions in S protein with 2 or fewer variants/position (marked in light blue, Fig. 1d ,e) are more prevalent in the structurally critical trimer interface (46% of the amino acids; Fig. 1d , Supplementary Fig. S1b ,c, see Supplementary Table S4) Table S3 ). Of those amino acid substitutions in the RBD, only 3% are predicted by PROVEAN software 32 to be structurally or functionally damaging (Supplementary Table S2 ). Using PROVEAN, we also examined the predicted impact of the amino acid substitutions in the common more infective variants (B. Furin proteolysis sites. We next examined other regions in the S protein for which functions have been assigned. Furin proteolysis at the S1-S2 boundary (681-685) and in S2 (811-815) exposes the RBD to enable hACE2 binding, and the S2 domain to initiate membrane fusion 5 . Recent studies show that these cleavage sites are not necessarily specific for furin-mediated proteolysis and that S protein may be processed by multiple proteases to open the RBD into the active conformation [2] [3] [4] 33 . Consistent with these observations, both the furin proteolysis consensus sites and the arginines that are critical for proteolysis are not conserved in the S protein (Fig. 2a) , in agreement with a prior analysis of furin cleavage site 1 34 .",

Neuropilin-1 (NRP-1) is a transmembrane receptor that regulates angiogenesis 35 and immune response 36 and is expressed in many cell types 36 such as the endothelium 37 , immune cells 38 , and neurons 39 . Interaction between NRP-1 and S protein was proposed to regulate SARS-CoV-2 transmission [20] [21] . Proteolysis of furin cleavage site 1 in the S protein of the index variant by furin was found to expose a C terminal motif, RXXR (where R is arginine and X is any amino acid), known to be the binding motif in NRP-1 19, 21 . For example, a monoclonal antibody against the RXXR-binding site on NRP-1 reduced SARS-CoV-2 infectivity in culture 21 . Nevertheless, we found that the NRP-1 interaction-site in S protein is not conserved (Fig. 2d) . Although the variants are predicted to have a neutral effect on the S protein structure (using Linoleic acid-binding site. A fatty acid-binding pocket has been identified in the inactive conformation of S protein 9 (Fig. 3a,b) . The amino acids that make this pocket are conserved in other coronaviruses 9 and are unchanged (less than 2 variants) in 75% of the positions (Fig. 3a,b) . Furthermore, among the 20 amino acids that line this pocket, 71% of the identified variants are predicted to have a neutral effect using PROVEAN (Supplementary Table S2 ). Analysis of the LA-bonding site identifies a potential pharmacophore that may fit small molecules (Fig. 3c) , perhaps by mimicking \u03c9-3 fatty acids 22 . . This less variable region is relatively hydrophobic, yet a substantial number of residues remain exposed in the open and closed conformations (Fig. 4c) . Six residues, V551, T553, C590, V595, V608, Y612, in this relatively invariable region form a part of the largest hydrophobic patch in the protein measuring 370 \u00c5 2 (Fig. 4d,e) . Five of these residues (excluding T553) www.nature.com/scientificreports/ along with other residues that make this hydrophobic patch tolerate very few mutations and almost all the mutations that are tolerated change to other hydrophobic amino acids (Fig. 4d) . We examined this region using Site Finder in Molecular Operating Environment (MOE) 40 and found that there is a binding site with a positive score for the propensity of ligand binding 41 , which encompasses several residues from this region (i.e. Cys590, Ser591, Phe592, Gly593) ( Supplementary Fig. S1e ). This hydrophobic region is also 81% identical between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, but less than 15% identical when comparing the SARS-CoV-2 sequence with that of MERS-CoV (Fig. 4f ).",

            "text": "While SARS-CoV-2 has a lower mutation rate than other viruses due to proof-reading mechanisms 23 , aspects such as a relatively high R 0 of 1.9 to 2.6 42 , comparatively long asymptomatic incubation and infection periods, and zoonotic origins, leads to high variability in mutations in specific regions compared to the original reference sequence. This has been illustrated with the divergence of 6 major lineages in the past few months (Table 1 ). Our analysis of the frequency of variants throughout the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 identified regions of high and low divergence, which may aid in developing effective prophylactic and therapeutic treatments. In this analysis of mutations in the S protein, we did not consider the frequency of a particular mutation or in how many countries the mutation was found. Such analysis, as was done for D614G 43 , may further aid in determining the potential improved viral fitness acquired by a particular mutation. Protein glycosylation is essential for viral infection 44 . In SARS-CoV-2 S protein, there are 22 known N-glycosylation sites per monomer (Fig. 2b,c) , but only one, asparagine 343, appears to be conserved. Furthermore, we found 156 positions in S protein that mutate to an asparagine residue in the existing 3540 variants that we analyzed, and many of them are exposed on the S protein ( Supplementary Fig. S1d ). We propose that some of these new asparagine residues may create new glycosylation sites on the S protein that can contribute to immune evasion. Such an impact on the immune evasion by changes in the positions of glycosylation sites of viral envelope proteins have been described for influenza viruses; e.g., H3N2 has numerous new N-linked glycans on the viral hemagglutinin that enabled the virus to escape antibody neutralization and evade the host's immune system 45 . The formation of new glycosylation positions may also affect viral susceptibility to existing antibodies and to the immune response of infected individuals. A cryo-electron microscopy study has already suggested that coronaviruses mask important immunogenic sites on their surface by glycosylation 46 . Furthermore, recent work suggests that changes in glycosylation sites on the S protein of the virus may affect recognition of the S protein by other potential human proteins and receptors, inducing the toll-like receptors, calcitonin-like receptors, and heat shock protein GRP78, thus leading to a more severe inflammation that characterizes a more severe form of COVID-19 47 .",

However, our analysis suggests that not all these sites will be effective targets for prophylaxis and therapeutics. Specifically, the trimer interface is less accessible and therefore unlikely to be druggable. Another issue relates to the furin cleavage sites. As the viral S protein activation appears to require furin proteolysis 2-4 , protease-specific inhibitors are tested as a means to protect from infection 48 . However, our analysis suggests that this may not be an effective strategy, given the high variability of furin cleavage sites. This suggestion is consistent with previous data showing that other proteinases expressed throughout the body may work synergistically to activate the S protein 2,33 . Therefore, drugs that focus on inhibiting any single protease may not be effective preventative treatment against all SARS-CoV-2 variants. Similarly, the NRP1-binding site that is generated by proteolysis and the exposure of a C-terminal RXXR motif 19,21 may not be a good target for treatment against all SARS-CoV-2 variants, unless such a motif is also created by other proteases.",

There might be a benefit in focusing on the LA-binding site that help stabilize the S protein in the inactive closed conformer. Small molecules that mimic LA and bind into the LA pocket may stabilize the S protein in the closed/inactive conformation, thus reducing infectivity (Fig. 3a-c) . Therefore, exploring the LA pharmacophore (Fig. 3c) with small molecules that can hold the S-protein in closed conformation, thus preventing the presentation of RBD to hACE2, could be of great interest as this may reduce viral infectivity. Our data also suggest that it may be beneficial to develop passive and active vaccines that target the RBD, instead of the entire glycosylated S protein; the RBD is less variable relative to the whole S protein (compare Fig. 1e,d) . However, similar to some of the common viral isolates, such as the South African, B.1.351, new amino acid substitutions in the RBD may evade such therapeutics; e.g., loss of immunoreactivity to monoclonal antibodies 24 .",

Determining how druggable the pocket encompassing this region is (residues Cys590, Ser591, Phe592, Gly593), provided its solvent exposure, and whether modulating S protein by engaging this site will have a biological consequence is a challenge (Supplementary Fig. S1e ). Very recently, Q564 within this region (star in Fig. 4a ) has been proposed to act as a 'latch' , stabilizing the closed/inactive conformation of the S protein 49 . The high degree of conservation of hydrophobicity in this region potentially indicates its role in membrane fusion and/or maintaining structural integrity. The sequence similarity between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV (Fig. 4f) further supports the importance of this region, especially as both viruses have a similar route of infection. Determining the role of this invariable region warrants a further study, as it may be another Achilles heel to target for anti-SARS-CoV-2 treatment. ",
