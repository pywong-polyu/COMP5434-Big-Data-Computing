Four of the six patients presented with atypical XLA clinical and laboratory findings, including normal IgM, IgG, or IgA levels and fewer than 2% of peripheral B cells. As BTK protein was detectable, no BTK gene analysis was initially made but a later NGS target panel analysis for hypogammaglobulinemia (including the BTK gene) showed missense mutations: one in the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain and three in the Src-homology-2 (SH2) domain. This genotype has been associated with a delayed diagnosis and an atypical XLA phenotype [5] . These patients had detectable responses to tetanus toxoid vaccine and failed to respond to pneumococcal vaccine. Among the five previously uninfected XLA patients, two with the classical XLA phenotype showed no response even after the second vaccine dose (0.2 U/mL), whereas the three carrying BTK SH2-or PH-domain mutations responded with an increase in anti-Spike Ig levels at T2 (median titer 272 U/mL, range 193 to 1110).",
