            "text": "Starting at the end of 2019, a global pandemic spread rapidly across the globe, caused by a new severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-Cov-2), resulting in a public health crisis of unprecedented magnitude. 1 The clinical picture of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) ranges from asymptomatic to rapidly developing acute respiratory distress syndrome associated with a high fatality rate. 2, 3 Beyond the pulmonary symptoms of COVID-19, cardiac involvement (expressed primarily as acute heart failure, acute coronary syndromes, myocardial injury, and pulmonary embolism) appears to be a significant feature of COVID-19 and is associated with the worst prognosis. [4] [5] [6] Moreover, patients with pre-existing cardiovascular disease display a higher risk of developing severe disease or dying. 7 In this context, early risk stratification of patients at risk of severe COVID-19 is paramount to optimize management of patient-flow and resource allocation. 8 Besides markers of cardiac injury (e.g. natriuretic peptides and troponin), transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) is an accessible, non-invasive, and widely used first-line diagnostic tool 9 to monitor the effects of COVID-19 on the heart. The American Society of Echocardiography and the European Association of Cardiovascular Imaging both published recommendations for TTE in the context of COVID-19. 10, 11 Limited data are currently available on the diagnostic contribution of TTE in COVID-19 and the link with clinical outcomes. [12] [13] [14] We sought to investigate the prognostic value of TTE parameters in a multicentre cohort of patients with COVID-19, in terms of in-hospital death or transfer to intensive care (ICU).",

According to World Health Organization criteria, a confirmed case of SARS-Cov-2 was defined as a positive result on real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction of nasopharyngeal swabs or lower respiratory tract aspirates (confirmed case) or as typical imaging characteristics on chest computed tomography when laboratory testing results were inconclusive (probable case). 16 Patients <18 years or who were admitted direct to ICU were excluded. Patient selection for ICU transfer was left to the discretion of the referring medical team in accordance with recommendations during the 'first wave'. 17 The study was initiated by the French Society of Cardiology (Critical COVID-19 France, NCT04344327) and declared to the French data protection committee (Commission Nationale Informatique et Libert\u00e9, CNIL, authorization MR3910090420).

Optimal protective precautions were taken for sonographers or physicians during each examination, in accordance with the recommendations for cardiac imaging in COVID-19. 10, 11 As the goal was to perform a focused TTE examination in COVID-19 patients, the following regular TTE parameters were recorded. Left ventricular (LV) size was measured in the parasternal long-axis views: LV dilatation was defined as an end-diastolic diameter >52 mm (women) or >58 mm (men); LV hypertrophy was defined as an LV mass >95 g/m 2 (women) or >115 g/m 2 (men). 18 LV ejection fraction (LVEF) was assessed either by visual evaluation or by Simpson's biplane method when image quality allowed for accurate quantification. Precautions were taken for a complete analysis of the right ventricle (RV), with good delimitation of the RV-free wall, thus avoiding RV foreshortening. RV dilatation was defined when the basal diameter was >41 mm (RV focused view) or when the RV/LV ratio was >0.6 (four-chamber or subcostal view). RV dysfunction was defined as tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion <17 mm by M-mode, or a tricuspid S wave <9.5 cm/s by Doppler tissue imaging, or a fractional area change <35%. 18 Pericardial effusion was also reported.",

            "text": "Clinical significance of TTE parameters TTE appears useful for risk stratification in COVID-19, with a key role as a widely available bedside test. Figure 5 illustrates two cases where TTE provided important information on the RV. In the study by Dweck et al., 13 an immediate change in management occurred in 33% of 1216 patients who underwent TTE. As all medical interventions in our study were at the discretion of the referring team, we do not know precisely when TTE played a role in the decision to transfer to ICU. TTE results alone cannot determine patient orientation; rather, the decision is made based on a multiparametric strategy that includes clinical and comorbidities findings ( Figure 4) . However, echocardiography appears to be a valuable tool, not only for initiating or modifying treatments but also to facilitate decisions regarding changes in the level of patient care (i.e. ICU transfer and haemodynamic support). 13 The association between right-side TTE parameters and prognosis in patients with COVID-19 has been explored. Szekely et al. 14 reported that the most frequent abnormality among patients with clinical deterioration during follow-up was RV dilatation (with or without dysfunction). In univariable analysis, they found that shorter pulmonary acceleration time was associated with clinical deterioration and that increased RV end-diastolic area was associated with mortality. Similarly, other studies 12, 29 showed that RV global longitudinal strain was a powerful predictor of death in patients with COVID-19. In an analysis from a US multicentre retrospective study, adverse RV remodelling conferred a >2-fold increase in mortality risk. 21 In addition, our study underlined the importance of the multiparametric approach including clinical variables (body mass index, sex), comorbidities (anticoagulation), and echocardiography (RV dilatation) to improve prediction of death but also of ICU transfer. Some studies reported that in addition to clinical and biological factors, a reduction of LVEF had also a poor prognosis in COVID-19. 30, 31 Rath et al. 32 described the poor prognosis of COVID-19 patients with both RV and LV dysfunction. In our study, RV dilatation evaluated during a bedside echocardiography was independently associated with death or ICU transfer in patients with COVID-19.",

            "text": "Several studies reported an abnormally higher rate of pulmonary embolism in patients with COVID-19, 33,34 associated with a poorer prognosis. 4 Nevertheless, pulmonary embolism is not the only cause of RV dilatation. In our study, there was no statistically significant difference in terms of pulmonary embolism between patients with or without RV dilatation, confirming that RV dilatation reflects more than just pulmonary vascular disease. In reality, RV dilatation in patients who met the primary outcome could be explained by the extent of lung involvement, both parenchymal and vascular. Indeed, lung involvement can be characterized by both diffuse alveolar disease and pulmonary intravascular coagulopathy in the context of COVID-19. 35 Nevertheless, there were no statistical differences in our study between patients with or without RV dilatation in terms of oxygen administration, severity of lung involvement on computed tomography, and biological inflammatory parameters, which also highlights the key role of TTE in stratifying a patient's risk of death or transfer to ICU.",

Second, in contrast to the study by Szekely et al., 14 our TTE examinations were 'focused' rather than 'comprehensive', and we cannot exclude the possibility of interobserver variability. 10, 11 Third, echocardiography results were analysed in each centre and not in a central echocardiography core laboratory, which may induce a bias in the reproducibility of the measurements. However, the large number of participating centres reduces this bias, and our findings concerning RV dilatation/dysfunction are similar to other studies. 13 Fourth, the precise indications of TTE and the timing of TTE use were not studied. Nevertheless, patients who underwent TTE had a higher prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors and/or cardiovascular history, but especially more cardiovascular manifestations and/or probably higher suspected complications secondary to COVID-19, which may have motivated the performance of TTE. Fifth, among patients with RV dilatation, computed tomography pulmonary angiography was not systematically performed, which does not allow us to rule out the possibility that RV dilatation is statistically linked to pulmonary embolism.",
