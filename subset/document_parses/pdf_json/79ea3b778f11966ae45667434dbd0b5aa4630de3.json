Though we did not notice a significant rise in the number of cases in the month of February and like many other countries, this number escalated like anything from March 2020. This research paper will include analysis of covid-19 data initially at a global level and then drilled down to the scenario of India. Data is gathered from multiple data sources from several authentic government websites. The paper will also include analysis of various features like gender, geographical location, age using Python and Data Visualization techniques. Getting insights on Trend pattern and time series analysis will bring more clarity to the current scenario as analysis is totally on real-time data(till 19 th June). Finally we will use some machine learning algorithms and perform predictive analytics of the near future scenario. We are using a sigmoid model to give an estimate of the day on which we can expect the number of active cases to reach its peak and also when the curve will start to flatten sigmoid model gives us a count of date which is a unique feature of analysis in this paper. We are also using certain feature engineering techniques to transfer data into logarithmic scale for better comparison removing any data extremities or outliers. Based on the predictions of the short-term interval, our model can be tuned to forecast long time intervals.",

On 12th January 2020 the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the novel coronavirus was responsible for the respiratory illness of a community of people in Wuhan, China. First confirmed case in India was reported on 30th January and the first confirmed death was reported on 12th March. Eventually all Indians were addressed by the Government of India to maintain social distancing as a preventive measure. People were supposed to follow this till 31st March, however before that only the nationwide lockdown was announced. Only essential services were kept open. Major cities and some state made wearing face masks compulsory. Central armed forces came into action. Helpline numbers was set up.",

We can also count to medical supply sector, Information and Communication Technology (ICT) supermarkets and e-commerce sector as other potential winners. Not to forget telecom sector has also reported increased demand to internet and voice services in the lockdown period. The ministry of Electronics and IT has successfully launched an application called Aarogya Setu. Its wonderfully designed database provides necessary information about contact tracing. The government has also announced an amount of RS 20.97 crore package which will be infused in several sectors. This package accounts nearly 10% of GDP of the country.

Data scientists all over the world are busy in making sense out of the available data and predict the near future. Finding trend pattern, feature selection, forecasting techniques are being applied in and out to come to a conclusion. Rajan Gupta and Saibal Kumar Pal, in their research paper 'Trend analysis and forecasting of covid-19 break in India' used exploratory data analysis to report the situation in the time period of January to March in India. They use time series forecasting methods to predict the future trends. A very famous machine learning model-Arima model prediction was used and the inferred a result that predicted huge range of the number of likely covid-19 positive cases in April and May. The average that was forecasted was a detection of approximately 7000 patients in a span of 30 days in April. However in reality the figures were pretty higher. Another research paper by the department of CSE and IT of Northcap University, India in collaboration with Defence Research and Development Organization (DRDO) India also covered data from January 30 to March 30, 2020.",

This research paper helps to pick certain facts that common people mostly unaware of. A detailed consumer behavior analysis along with the experiences reveals the danger of Covid-19 to smokers. Another very relevant paper in the journal of 'Chaos, Solitons & Fractals' uses clustering methods to analyze countries on the basis of most affected patients and how they are reacting to it. This paper shows the world scenario first and thereby drilling down to the country of Mexico. Speaking of a country like India, where approximately 65% are belonging to rural population, accessibility and utilization of primary health care during the current pandemic situation is a big question. A similar study has been done in UK and we can find its related paper in the journal-'Health Social Care in the community'. This inspires me to conduct a similar study in India. However it is quite and qualitative research and is beyond the scope of this paper. Another recently published paper in the journal -'Chaos Solitons & Fractals'",
