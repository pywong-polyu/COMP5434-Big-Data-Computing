As medical staff did not encounter such a situation previously, no prior knowledge and guidelines were present to assist them. During the care of obstetric women infected with COVID-19 as well as those who are suspected of COVID-19 infection, there are two objectives, the care of asymptomatic to severely sick pregnant and postpartum women and preventing exposure of medical professionals and others during childbirth hospitalization. The focus of this review is to provide anesthesiologists who are dealing with infected pregnant mothers with some facts or, as data is insufficient, expert opinion, with an emphasis on awareness and optimal medical obstetric anesthesia training. This review will provide possible recommendations for the obstetric anesthesiologists when treating infected obstetric women and these recommendations also help anesthesia providers to prepare themselves for future pandemics.",

            "text": "In December 2019, a virus known as SARS-CoV-II has emerged from Wuhan and rapidly spread to other countries. The infection caused by SRAS-COV-II is termed COVID-19. The common symptoms of this infection are flu, fever, diarrhea, fatigue, and cough Chan and Brownstein 2020) . COVID-19 caused 100 thousand fatalities around the world due to its high transmissible nature and was termed a pandemic (Melnick and Ioannidis 2020). Though elective procedures could be delayed preventing exposure and save personal protective equipment (PPE) during the pandemic (Critical care and anaesthesia service reorganisation 2020). All the other medical treatments were postponed during lockdown situations but the obstetric activity could not be delayed or postponed. The susceptibility of pregnant women for developing COVID-19 infection is more due to physiological changes in their immune and cardiovascular systems (Breslin et al. 2020) . Thus, special care is required for pregnant women before, during, and after delivery or C-section. Before this pandemic, obstetric anesthesiologists were only encountered with healthy pregnant mothers and focused to provide best practice standards and choices for what patients want for a safe and better birth experience, although they encountered sick pregnant women sometimes but sick in terms of maternal morbidity related to obesity, aging, eclampsia, cardiovascular diseases, and postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) (Mhyre et al. 2011; Jain and Shirodkar 2019) . These conditions are already appearing as a threat to modern society; now, the emergence of COVID-19 worsens the situation. Anesthesiologists have to deal with infected pregnant women, when there are no prior studies about the disease severity in pregnant women or guidelines are present to adopt for preventing the spread of infection from affected mother to hospital staff and neonatal. Moreover, from the previous 1.5 years, it has been observed that an enormous number of people are infected with SARS-CoV-II that increases the demand of hospitals, intensive care units (ICUs), and hospital staff including nurses and anesthesiologists. Moreover, obstetric anesthetists did not face this situation previously.",

However, most of these characteristic symptoms could be related to pregnancy and labor symptoms (Chen et al. 2020a) . Myalgias and diarrhea are common indications of latent labor; moreover, pre-eclampsia could induce severe pain in the head; difficulty in breathing is common throughout pregnancy and labor. Moreover, tachycardia and fever could be caused by chorioamnionitis. All these signs lead doctors to neglect COVID-19 infection as a probable disease. Furthermore, COVID-19-infected women may be asymptomatic until they are admitted to the hospital for labor and delivery. This situation poses a considerable risk of transmission of the virus to the patient's family (the infant) and any healthcare workers engaged in their care (Breslin et al. 2020; Wastnedge et al. 2021 ).",

After that, replication of the virus occurs in the airway epithelium of the lungs.

Airborne precautions are recommended for aerosol-generating procedures (AGPs). Exhaling deeply during labor and pushing during delivery does not generate aerosols (Daykin and Moore 2020).",

When it comes to intravenous fluid treatment, be cautious. Monitoring of fluid status of women with mild-severe infection symptoms must be done carefully through input-output chart after every hour. This will help to find a link between COVID-19 and acute respiratory distress syndrome. Fluid boluses in the range of 250-500 mL should be administered with reevaluation instead of continuing with fluid restoration. IV.

Moreover, the intensity of the platelet reduction is directly linked with the severity of the COVID-19 infection in patients.

Airborne precautions are preferred in the case of general anesthesia while droplet precautions are preferred in the case of neuraxial anesthesia. Though, there are possibilities of the conversion to general anesthesia from neuraxial anesthesia during the operation so it is recommended; so, using airborne precautions is always preferred even in the case of neuraxial anesthesia (Bampoe et al. 2020) . In order to minimize the risk of getting contaminated during the conversion process to general anesthesia, the clinical professionals should wear N95 or FFP2/3 face masks rather than the regular ones. Clinicians must look for alternative options to opt for in order to avoid the shifting from neuraxial anesthesia to general anesthesia. A speedy spinal anesthetic is always preferred over general anesthesia even during category 1 C-section operations because of its hectic steps as well as the risk of aerosolization in COVID-19 patients. Even in emergency cases, the most skilled anesthesia provider should perform spinal anesthesia to avoid the multiple failed attempts as well as the need of shifting it to general anesthesia (Hani et al. 2020) .",

The traditional parturient cycle has been interrupted, and now, the medical staff has to transfer puerperal or post-cesarean patients to units that have never encountered such patients before. The list of new obstacles for patients may go on for dozens of pages, but it is unclear whether or not the quality of care is in jeopardy. In a nutshell, we must learn to work in low-resource environments in some ways. Various recommendations and publications on the safety of neuraxial surgeries in pregnant COVID-19 women have been published to guide medical staff. What if a COVID-19 positive woman develops a complication, like postpartum hemorrhage, or if a non-COVID-19 woman requires ICU admission? Are we currently capable and equipped to provide a high level of care? Returning to the highest levels of care for obstetric patients is really the challenge yet. ",
