The World Health Organisation (WHO) emphasized already in March, 2020 the importance of access to testing for the effective control of SARS-CoV-2. 1 While reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) remains the gold standard among all diagnostic tests for SARS-CoV-2, access may be limited due to shortages of instruments, supplies and experienced operators, particularly in resource-limited settings. Antigendetecting tests offer an alternative to RT-PCR and have been recommended by the WHO for appropriate settings where nucleic acid amplification technology (NAAT) testing is limited or where prolonged turnaround times slow down clinical testing. 2 The recommendation outlines that only Ag-RDT meeting the minimum performance requirements of \u226580% sensitivity and \u226597% specificity compared to a NAAT reference assay should be considered for use. 2 . Before implementation of Ag-RDTs a manufacturer-independent evaluation should be conducted to assess claims made by the manufacturer.",

Second, the reference standard testing was performed on an NP swab in Heidelberg versus an NP/OP swab in Berlin. However, a recent systematic review does not suggest those sampling methods to yield different results. 23 And lastly, we performed difference PCR methods as a reference standard. However, we ensured comparability by calibrating the methods and reporting on viral load. is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in (which was not certified by peer review) preprint",

[24] [25] [26] Policy makers should move from considering only test sensitivity to more holistic testing strategies, incorporating Ag-RDTs in addition to and in combination with RT-PCR to optimize the reach and depth of testing. The biggest limitation to such strategies on a global scale are likely to be manufacturing production shortages. However, with two tests (SD Biosensor/Roche Standard Q and Abbott PanBio) from large manufacturers already showing very high sensitivity and being WHO recommended, many other Ag-RDT are likely to follow in the pipeline. The hope is justified that the demand for Ag-RDTs will be met and also that prices of the tests will fall as has been observed for RDTs for other diseases as for example Malaria. 4, 27, 28 .
