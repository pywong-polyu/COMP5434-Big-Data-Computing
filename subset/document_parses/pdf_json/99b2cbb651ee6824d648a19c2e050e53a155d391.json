            "text": "The diversity of lagoviruses (Caliciviridae) in Australia has increased considerably in recent years. By the end of 2017, five variants from three viral genotypes were present in populations of Australian rabbits, while prior to 2014 only two variants were known. To understand the evolutionary interactions among these lagovirus variants, we monitored their geographical distribution and relative incidence over time in a continental-scale competition study. Within 3 years of the incursion of rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus 2 (RHDV2, denoted genotype GI.1bP-GI.2 [polymerase genotype]P-[capsid genotype]) into Australia, two novel recombinant lagovirus variants emerged: RHDV2-4e (genotype GI.4eP-GI.2) in New South Wales and RHDV2-4c (genotype GI.4cP-GI.2) in Victoria. Although both novel recombinants contain non-structural genes related to those from benign, rabbit-specific, enterotropic viruses, these variants were recovered from the livers of both rabbits and hares that had died acutely. This suggests that the determinants of host and tissue tropism for lagoviruses are associated with the structural genes, and that tropism is intricately connected with pathogenicity. Phylogenetic analyses demonstrated that the RHDV2-4c recombinant emerged independently on multiple occasions, with five distinct lineages observed. Both the new RHDV2-4e and -4c recombinant variants replaced the previous dominant parental RHDV2 (genotype GI.1bP-GI.2) in their respective geographical areas, despite sharing an identical or near-identical (i.e. single amino acid change) VP60 major capsid protein with the parental virus. This suggests that the observed replacement by these recombinants was not driven by antigenic variation in VP60, implicating the non-structural genes as key drivers of epidemiological fitness. Molecular clock estimates place the RHDV2-4e recombination event in early to mid-2015, while the five RHDV2-4c recombination events occurred from late 2015 through to early 2017. The emergence of at least six viable recombinant variants within a 2-year period highlights the high frequency of these events, detectable only through intensive surveillance, and demonstrates the importance of recombination in lagovirus evolution.",

The first lagoviruses identified, from hares in Europe in the early 1980s, were those of the GII.1 genotype (European brown hare syndrome virus) (Gavier-Widen and Morner, 1991) . Subsequently, mortality events in Oryctolagus rabbits in China in 1984 led to the discovery of RHDV1, a genotype GI.1 virus (Liu et al., 1984) . As the diversity of GI.1 viruses increased, this genotype was further subdivided into several variants based on the VP60 Figure 1 .

In 1997, antigenic variants of GI.1 viruses, now classified as RHDVa (GI.1a), were described in Italy (Capucci et al., 1998) and these spread throughout Europe and more distantly. Then, in 2010, RHDV2 (GI.2) first emerged in France (Dalton et al., 2012; Le Gall-Recule et al., 2011a . RHDV2 rapidly spread globally, triggering epizootics worldwide in wild and domestic lagomorph populations. As surveillance efforts and technologies improved, non-pathogenic lagoviruses RCV-E1 (genotype GI.3), RCV-E2 (GI.4), and RCV-A1 (also GI.4) were identified in the 1990s, first in Europe (Capucci et al., 1996 , 1997 , Le Gall-Recule et al., 2011b and then in Australia (Strive, Wright, and Robinson 2009) and New Zealand (Nicholson et al., 2017) . Non-pathogenic hare lagoviruses, HaCVs (GII.2, GII.3, GII.4, and GII.5), have also been reported recently, in 2014 in Europe (Cavadini et al., 2020; Droillard et al., 2020) and 2019 in Australia (Mahar et al., 2019) .",

Virus particles contain both genomic RNA (gRNA) and 3 \u2032 -co-terminal sub-genomic RNAs (sgRNA) approximately 2.5 kb in length (Ohlinger et al., 1990) . In lagoviruses, the non-structural (NS) genes are situated upstream of the major capsid protein, VP60, all of which are encoded as a single large polyprotein (ORF1), while the 3 \u2032 -terminal ORF2 encodes a minor structural protein that is essential for infectivity and is presumed to be important for genome release during infection (Sosnovtsev et al., 2005; Conley et al., 2019) . Lagoviruses encode seven NS proteins, including a helicase (2C-like), a viral genome-linked protein (VpG), a protease (Pro), an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), and three proteins of unknown functions (p16, p23, and p29). Both gRNA and sgRNA are linked to VpG at their 5 \u2032 -end and are polyadenylated at their 3 \u2032 -end (Meyers, Wirblich, and Thiel 1991) . There is considerable homology between the 5 \u2032 -terminal nucleotide sequences of the gRNA and sgRNA ( Fig. 1) (Meyers, Wirblich, and Thiel 1991) , enabling recombination at this site. The RdRp-VP60 junction is also highly conserved within and between genogroups, facilitating intergenotypic template switching at this region.",

In the Caliciviridae, recombination frequently occurs at the junction between the NS and structural genes, effectively mixing a set of structural genes with an entirely new set of NS genes (Bull et al., 2005; Ludwig-Begall, Mauroy, and Thiry 2018; Abrantes et al., 2020) . Recombinant lagoviruses are defined by the nomenclature [RdRp genotype]P-[capsid genotype], and include combinations of two pathogenic RHDVs (e.g. GI.1bP-GI.2) as well as the seemingly more common combination of a benign RCV and a pathogenic RHDV (e.g. GI.4eP-GI.1a, GI.4eP-GI.2, GI.3P-GI.2) (Lopes et al., 2015 (Lopes et al., , 2019 Dalton et al., 2018; Hall et al., 2018; Mahar et al., 2018b; Silverio et al., 2018; Abrantes et al., 2020) . Phylogenetic analyses have demonstrated that all genotype GI.2 viruses described so far are recombinants, implying that GI.2 is an orphan capsid-type (Abrantes et al., 2020) .

These variants differ in their host and tissue tropism and in pathogenicity ( Fig. 2) (Mahar et al., 2018a) . RCV-A1 (GI.4) is a benign enterotropic virus that has circulated in wild and domestic rabbits since at least the 1950s (Strive, Wright, and Robinson 2009; Mahar et al., 2016) . RHDV1 (GI.1c) and RHDVa-K5 (GI.1a) are pathogenic viruses, both deliberately released as biocontrols (Kerr, Hall, and Strive 2021) . RHDVa-Aus (GI.4eP-GI.1a) and RHDV2 (GI.1bP-GI.2) were both exotic incursions, first detected through syndromic surveillance activities in January 2014 and May 2015, respectively (Hall et al., 2015; Mahar et al., 2018a) . Both exotic incursions are themselves recombinant viruses, and, like the orphan GI.2 structural genes, the NS genes of RHDVa-Aus (GI.4eP-GI.1a) form an orphan clade within the diversity of GI.4 sequences that was designated as genotype GI.4e (Mahar et al., 2018b) . Importantly, the orphan nature of this clade is likely due to a lack of lagovirus genomic surveillance in China, the likely source country of RHDVa-Aus. Phylogenetic analyses suggest that both incursions arose from single point source introductions with subsequent ongoing transmission in Australian rabbit populations (Mahar et al., 2018a,b) . Phylodynamic analyses place the incursion of RHDV2 (GI.1bP-GI.2) during early 2014, while serological analyses suggest the incursion occurred slightly later during the spring of 2014 (September to November) (Mahar et al., 2018a; Ramsey et al., 2020) . Both analyses indicated that RHDV2 (GI.1bP-GI.2) rapidly replaced RHDV1 (GI.1c) within 18 months of its arrival. Insufficient RHDVa-Aus (GI.4eP-GI.1a) sequences are available for phylodynamic analyses to reliably estimate the time of incursion. In mid-2017, a novel GI.4eP-GI.2 recombinant virus (designated here as RHDV2-4e) was detected in Australia, comprising the NS genes of the RHDVa-Aus virus (GI.4eP) and structural genes of RHDV2 (GI.2) (Hall et al., 2018) .",

The genetic diversity of Australian lagoviruses arose from a small number of incursion events, and the parental sequence as well as the timing of the introduction is known in several instances. Since there is little movement of rabbits into the country, the study of lagoviruses can occur in a relatively controlled environment with a defined number of pre-existing variants. Additionally, a robust surveillance system for these viruses has been in place since 2014. Prior to this, syndromic surveillance and convenience sampling were used to investigate rabbit mortality events since the 1990s, providing a broad understanding of lagovirus presence and epidemiology in Australia. The previous lack of diversity of the Australian lagovirus population and sudden diversification of lagovirus variants in 2014-5 created ideal natural experimental conditions for monitoring the epidemiological and evolutionary dynamics of existing lagovirus variants, while determining the frequency and importance of successful recombination events between these viruses. There are seven known GI lagovirus variants circulating in Australian leporids. Two of these were introduced as biocontrol agents, two were exotic incursions, two emerged in Australia via recombination, and one is benign and endemic in Australian European rabbit populations. Variants differ in host range, pathogenicity, propensity to cause disease in young rabbits, and in the primary site of viral replication (tissue tropism). Protein-coding regions are coloured by the genotype in the genome schematic; recombinant variants are indicated by different coloured non-structural and structural coding segments.",

The remaining samples were screened for recombination by RT-PCR and sequencing. RT-PCR primers were designed that spanned the RdRp-VP60 junction, generating a 555-bp amplicon (Rec2 RT-PCR; Supplementary Table S1). Primers were subsequently modified by the 5 \u2032 -addition of Illumina pre-adapter and index primerbinding sequences to enable high-throughput Illumina sequencing (Rec2.tailed RT-PCR; Supplementary Table S1). Assays were experimentally validated to confirm reactivity with all known Australian lagoviruses. For a subset of samples (prior to the development of the Rec2 RT-PCR), amplification over the RdRp-VP60 junction was performed with alternative primer sets (Supplementary Table S1 ). Briefly, each 25 \u00b5l PCR reaction comprised 1\u00d7 OneStep Ahead RT-PCR master mix (Qiagen), 1\u00d7 OneStep Ahead RT mix (Qiagen), 0.5 \u00b5M each primer and 1 \u00b5l of extracted RNA diluted 1/10 in nuclease-free water.

Due to recombination between the NS and VP60 genes, two data sets either side of the recombination breakpoint were analysed separately: (1) a VP60 gene data set containing all published Australian GI.2 VP60 sequences (RHDV2) together with the VP60 genes of the recombinants sequenced here (n = 332; 1,737 nt; Supplementary Table S6) and (2) an NS gene data set of all published Australian GI.4 (RCV-A1 and RHDVa-Aus) sequences together with the NS genes of the recombinants sequenced here (n = 188; 5,218 nt; Supplementary Table S7 ). The Bayesian Evolutionary Analysis by Sampling Trees (BEAST) software v1.8 (Drummond and Rambaut 2007 ) was used to conduct Bayesian MCMC analysis of each data set, using substitution models inferred by ModelFinder as implemented in IQ-TREEv1.6.11 (VP60, SYM + G4; NS, SYM + I + G4) (Zharkikh 1994; Minh et al., 2020) . A discrete trait partition indicating the sampling location (Australian state) was included to facilitate the ancestral state reconstruction of location (utilizing the symmetric substitution model, inferring the social network with Bayesian Stochastic Search Variable Selection, and a strict clock model). All analyses were run twice to convergence (defined as an effective sample size >200) to confirm consistency. Marginal likelihood estimation using path sampling/stepping-stone sampling was used to assess the most appropriate clock model prior (strict vs uncorrelated log-normally distributed [UCLD] ) and tree prior (Gaussian Markov random field Bayesian skyride model vs constant size coalescent vs exponential coalescent) for the nucleotide partition.",

As this assay is only able to detect specific recombinant variants (Hall et al., 2018) , to comprehensively screen for lagovirus recombination events we sequenced the RdRp-VP60 junction region (i.e. the typical recombination breakpoint) of 1,034 lagoviruses collected between January 2014 and September 2020 (inclusive) from wild and domestic lagomorphs found dead across Australia. This screen identified six distinct lagovirus variants circulating in Australia during the study period; four known variants: RHDV1 (GI.1cP-GI.1c, n = 18), RHDV2 (GI.1bP-GI.2, n = 390), RHDVa-K5 (GI.1aP-GI.1a, n = 121), RHDVa-Aus (GI.4eP-GI.1a, n = 12); the previously reported RHDV2-4e recombinant (GI.4eP-GI.2, n = 133); and a novel putative recombinant designated RHDV2-4c (GI.4cP-GI.2, n = 356); along with four mixed infections.

Recombination analyses of the novel putative RHDV2-4c viruses also detected a recombination breakpoint at the typical RdRp-VP60 junction ( Table 1 ). The most likely parental variants for RHDV2-4c, as determined by the RDP4 software, were benign Australian RCV-A1 (GI.4c) lagoviruses in the NS region (GenBank accession KX357699) and Australian RHDV2 (GI.2) viruses in the structural region (GenBank accession MF421577), strongly suggesting that this recombination event occurred within Australia after the arrival of RHDV2 (GI.1bP-GI.2) in the late 2014.

This 2-year timeframe was consistently observed regardless of whether the analysis was conducted on the NS genes GI.4 data set or the VP60 gene GI.2 data set. Our phylogeographic analysis (Fig. 5A) suggests that all the RHDV2-4c recombinant lineages emerged in VIC (probability >0.99 for all lineages), with subsequent spread to other states.

For RHDV2-GI.4c viruses where a full genome sequence was not available, we first inferred a phylogeny from a 504-nt region spanning the RdRp-VP60 junction (Fig. 6B) ; this phylogeny was annotated using taxa for which the lineage was definitively known from the full-length VP60 phylogeny. While sequences from each RHDV2-4c lineage (as defined from the complete genome sequences) did not form monophyletic clades in the RdRp-VP60 junction phylogeny, they did form distinct groups with visible genetic distance between them (Fig. 6B) . These groups were distinct enough to assign an RHDV2-4c lineage type to those samples with partial sequence only. After assigning lineages to all RHDV2-4c recombinants, we explored the interactions between the different lineages by mapping their sampling locations over time. We found that four of the five lineages were already circulating in 2017 (Fig. 6) . Lineage ii was not detected after 2017 while the other four lineages continued to be detected throughout 2018, 2019, and 2020. In VIC, where all lineages are circulating, there was no clear indication of geographical clustering of the different lineages. In TAS, Lineages ii, iii, and iv were detected sporadically while lineage v has remained dominant over time. Similarly, in NSW/ACT Lineage iv has remained dominant, while Lineages i, ii, and iii were detected intermittently.",

Notably, four of the five RHDV2-4c recombinant lineages (classified based on nucleotide sequences) showed no lineage-defining amino acid changes in VP60 relative to the common ancestor of all Australian GI.2 VP60 sequences, suggesting that the emergence of these lineages was not associated with changes in antigenicity (Fig. 4A) . However, lineage-defining non-synonymous mutations were identified in the RHDV2-4c Lineage i and in the RHDV2-4e recombinant viruses (Fig. 4A ). When we mapped these mutations back to an atomic model of lagovirus GI VP60, both mutations were within the protruding domain, specifically the P2 subdomain that is known to contain immunodominant epitopes (Fig. 4B ) (Wang et al., 2013) . The RHDV2-4c Lineage i was associated with an S364G mutation, while an I434T mutation was present in all RHDV2-4e recombinants (Fig. 4A ). Thus, it is possible that the epidemiological fitness of RHDV2-4e in NSW/ACT may be attributable to antigenic changes in the capsid; however, this cannot explain the replacement of parental RHDV2 (GI.1bP-GI.2) by RHDV2-4c variants in VIC or TAS, or the continued co-circulation of RHDV2-4c lineages without changes in VP60. Furthermore, in the NSW/ACT the RHDV2-4e recombinant variant, despite the I434T change in VP60, appears to be currently undergoing replacement by RHDV2-4c. Ancestral state reconstruction using a phylogeny constructed on the NS coding sequences showed multiple amino acid changes between the different Australian RHDV2 variants within all mature peptide-coding regions ( Supplementary Fig. S2 ).",

We were interested to determine whether, after establishment, RHDV2 (GI.1bP-GI.2) viruses would continue to evolve via immune selection and antigenic drift or by other mechanisms. We were also interested to document whether variants without the GI.2 capsid would emerge as population immunity increased against this genotype. Instead, we found that the GI.2 structural genes were retained and that the emerging variants acquired alternative NS genes via recombination. It is becoming increasingly clear that recombination is a major driver of calicivirus diversity, facilitating the emergence of new variants including those with pandemic and panzootic potential (Eden et al., 2013; Ludwig-Begall, Mauroy, and Thiry 2018; Parra 2019; Abrantes et al., 2020) . However, the frequency at which viable recombination occurs and the genetic drivers of epidemiological fitness are still poorly understood. In this study, a continent-scale natural competition experiment of lagoviruses in Australia, we found that viable recombination occurs at an extremely high frequency given the right agent, host, and environmental circumstances.",

            "text": "Shortly after detecting two exotic lagovirus incursions in Australia, RHDVa-Aus (GI.4eP-GI.1a) in 2014 and RHDV2 (GI.1bP-GI.2) in 2015 (Hall et al., 2015; Mahar et al., 2018b) , we reported the emergence of a recombinant variant of these two viruses, RHDV2-4e (GI.4eP-GI.2), detected in July 2016 in NSW (Hall et al., 2018) . This finding prompted the development of improved molecular tests for the detection of recombination, and the subsequent retrospective and prospective screening of lagovirus-positive samples for further recombination events. This screen identified an additional novel recombinant lagovirus, designated RHDV2-4c (GI.4cP-GI.2), first detected in VIC in February 2017. Further analysis determined that the VP60 genes of RHDV2-4c separated into five distinct clades (Fig. 4A) , suggesting that this variant emerged on separate occasions following at least five independent recombination events. Recombination was already known to occur in lagoviruses. For example, in the last decade, the lagovirus GI.2 capsid has been detected in combination with five different sets of NS genes (Lopes et al., 2015; Hall et al., 2018; Abrantes et al., 2020; Szillat et al., 2020) . Our study demonstrates that viable recombination during natural infection occurs even more frequently than previously appreciated but may often go undetected if different events result in closely related progeny. Since the first detection of RHDV2 (GI.1bP-GI.2) in Australia in mid-2015 (Hall et al., 2015) , these structural genes have recombined and produced epidemiologically viable variants at least six times in a 2-year period. The previously reported RHDV2-4e recombinant arose from a recombination event between RHDVa-Aus (GI.4eP-GI.1a) and RHDV2 (GI.1bP-GI.2), both recombinant viruses themselves that were exotic incursions detected in Australia in January 2014 and May 2015, respectively, although the source of these viruses remains unknown (Hall et al., 2015; Hall et al., 2018; Mahar et al., 2018a,b) . Detections of the parental RHDVa-Aus (GI.4eP-GI.1a) were predominantly restricted to the Sydney basin region of NSW, with two cases detected in QLD and one further case detected in a wild rabbit in the ACT (Mahar et al., 2018b) . Therefore, it is not surprising that the RHDV2-4e (GI.4eP-GI.2) recombinant emerged in NSW/ACT, according to our epidemiological data and phylogeographic analysis (Fig. 5) . The RHDV2-4c (GI.4cP-GI.2) recombinants arose from recombination events between RHDV2 (GI.1bP-GI.2) and endemic RCV-A1 (GI.4c) viruses (Strive, Wright, and Robinson 2009; Hall et al., 2015; Mahar et al., 2016) . Emergence of the RHDV2-4c recombinant variants in the south-eastern states of Australia is consistent with high rabbit population densities and a high seroprevalence to RCV-A1 (GI.4) viruses in these regions compared to more arid regions of Australia (Liu et al., 2014) .",

This is not surprising given that the breakpoint locations are indistinguishable, and these recombinants (and their true parents) are very closely related. Indeed, it was only possible to infer a more accurate number of recombination events because of the high sampling frequency of parental RHDV2 VP60 sequences (GI.2), which has been maintained for this and previous studies. Had the genetic diversity of parental RHDV2 (GI.1bP-GI.2) VP60 sequences been undersampled, the RHDV2-4c recombinant VP60 sequences would have formed a monophyletic clade and a single recombination event assumed. This is demonstrated by the NS phylogeny (Fig. 5A) , in which the RHDV2-4c recombinant NS sequences form a single clade within the greater GI.4c clade. Importantly, within this clade the sequences still group into the same five lineages as seen in the VP60 tree ( Supplementary Fig. S2 ). Compared to pathogenic RHDV2 (GI.2) viruses, benign RCV-A1 (GI.4) viruses are greatly under-sampled in Australia, with the most recent GI.4 sequences (n = 6) derived from samples collected from the ACT in 2012 and 2014 (Mahar et al., 2016) . Aside from three sequences sampled in 2014, no other GI.4 (RCV-A1) sequences were available for the entirety of the study period. Consequently, a close relative of the GI.4cP parental virus was not identified, suggesting a hidden diversity of unsampled GI.4 viruses in Australian rabbits. This study provides a lower bound to the rate of recombination in these viruses; it is possible that additional recombination events have occurred with RCV-A1 (specifically variant GI.4c) viruses that are not observable against the current background of available GI.2 VP60 sequences.",

            "text": "Following the epizootic incursion of an antigenically novel virus, RHDV2 (GI.1bP-GI.2), into a na\u00efve population, the prevalence of this variant was extremely high in Australian rabbits, reflected by the estimated population-wide mortality rate of 60 per cent following its arrival (Ramsey et al., 2020) . The detection of four RHDV1 (GI.1c) and RHDV2 (GI.1bP-GI.2) co-infections in this study between 2015 and 2017 demonstrates that both viruses were circulating at sufficiently high prevalence for mixed infections to occur. However, this does not explain the predilection for RCV-A1like (GI.4) NS sequences. The discovery of RHDV2-4c (GI.4cP-GI.2) recombinants was surprising, since the parental RCV-A1 (GI.4c) is a benign enterotropic lagovirus (Strive, Wright, and Robinson 2009) , while RHDV2 (GI.1bP-GI.2) and RHDV1 (GI.1) viruses are virulent and hepatotropic (Fig. 2) . This would seem to preclude co-infection of individual cells with both viruses. Yet, several recombinants of RHDV2 (GI.2 structural sequences) and benign enterotropic RCVs (GI.3 NS sequences) have also been reported from Europe (Lopes et al., 2015 (Lopes et al., , 2019 Dalton et al., 2018; Silverio et al., 2018; Lopes et al., 2019; Abrantes et al., 2020) . This suggests that active replication of both RCVs and RHDV2 must be occurring in the same target cell. Extrapolating from our current understanding of human and murine norovirus tropism, macrophages or other immune cells may be likely candidates (Wobus et al., 2004) . This is further supported by the detection of plus-and minus-strand viral RNAs in splenic and alveolar macrophages of rabbits experimentally infected with RHDV1 (Kimura et al., 2001) . Additionally, RCVs (GI.3 and GI.4) typically infect young rabbits early in life (Capucci, Nardin, and Lavazza 1997; Strive, Wright, and Robinson 2009) . Although young rabbits can be infected with RHDV1 (GI.1) viruses, robust innate immunity limits the extent of viral replication in an age-dependent manner (Neave et al., 2018) . Thus, mixed infections with RHDV1 and RCVs are probably infrequent. This age-dependent resistance is not observed with RHDV2 (GI.2) infection (Neave et al., 2018) . Furthermore, the duration of infection is longer for benign RCVs compared to pathogenic variants, where infected individuals typically die within 48-72 h post-infection (Abrantes et al., 2012) . These factors may at least partly explain why RCV-RHDV2 recombinants appear to emerge more frequently than RHDV1-RHDV2 recombinants.",

This replacement, at least for several RHDV2-4c lineages, occurred without any associated antigenic changes in the VP60 capsid protein, demonstrating that the replacement was not driven by antigenic escape. This shows that NS sequence variation is an important driver of epidemiological fitness in lagoviruses, complementing similar findings in human and murine noroviruses (Ruis et al., 2017; Tohma et al., 2017; Ao et al., 2018) . For example, the pandemic GII.P16/GII.4 Sydney 2012 norovirus, which does not contain unique substitutions in the capsid, has substitutions within the RdRp that were proposed to increase transmissibility (Ruis et al., 2017) . This same GII.P16 P-type (with a different GII.2 capsid) was also shown to have mutations on the surface of the polymerase that correlated with an increased evolutionary rate (Ao et al., 2018 ). Yet in contrast, another study found that the evolutionary rate does not vary between genotypes or across genomic regions (Tohma et al., 2021) . Infection with the norovirus GII.P16-GII.2 variant also resulted in increased viral shedding compared to other norovirus genotypes, as measured by higher faecal viral loads (Cheung et al., 2019) . Previous studies have shown that RdRp fidelity and intra-host viral diversity affect transmissibility of murine norovirus in vivo, with high-fidelity variants being less efficiently transmitted than the wild-type variant (Arias et al., 2016) . Taken together, these studies demonstrate that NS proteins, particularly the RdRp, are important drivers of calicivirus fitness. Interestingly, the in vitro polymerase replication activity of the cloned RCV-A1 (GI.4c) RdRp was previously shown to be at least two times that of the RHDV1 (GI.1c) RdRp (Urakova et al., 2016) , although comparison to the GI.1b RdRp, the specific 'competing' variant in the current study, was not reported. Analogous to findings in murine norovirus, we propose that a higher replication rate of the RCV-A1 (GI.4) RdRp may lead to increased intra-host viral diversity and transmissibility of GI.4 recombinants (Arias et al., 2016) . However, we cannot rule out that other NS proteins may also contribute to the observed high fitness of the recombinant variants, given the many non-synonymous changes present throughout the NS-coding region ( Supplementary Fig. S2 ).",

The apparent dominance of Lineage iv in NSW/ACT and lineage v in TAS is consistent with founder effects in both of these states, where viruses from competing lineages without substantial fitness benefits were not able to outcompete pre-existing dominant variants. Onward transmission and early virus establishment would be highly stochastic. For example, infections in large meat or show rabbitries would have a much higher probability of onward transmission than an infection in a single pet rabbit. Hence, early dominance cannot be attributed to enhanced fitness without evidence of replacement. Given the observed rapid replacement of parental RHDV2 (GI.1bP-GI.2) by GI.4P recombinant variants in this study, this further supports a fitness advantage of these variants, conferred by the NS proteins and possibly associated with the RdRp.",

Indeed, this approach is of importance for many emerging and endemic viruses of significance to both animal and human health. Our finding that the NS genes strongly influence epidemiological fitness in the lagoviruses and that recombination happens so frequently, even in acute viral infections, concurs with similar findings on human noroviruses and emphasizes the importance of considering the full viral genome when undertaking surveillance for variants of concern. Caliciviruses, with a single major recombination breakpoint, provide an excellent model system to demonstrate this; however, this is likely true for many virus families. While conventionally the focus has been on detecting changes in the structural gene sequences, it is becoming clear that a deeper exploration of the genes encoding the NS proteins is necessary to better understand the complex drivers of viral epidemiological fitness.",
