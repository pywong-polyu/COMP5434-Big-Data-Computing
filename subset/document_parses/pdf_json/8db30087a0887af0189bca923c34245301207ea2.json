Therefore, it is becoming critical to understand the genetic basis of common diseases, for example, which genes predispose and rare genetic variants contribute to diseases, and so on. Our study focuses on helping researchers, medical practitioners, and pharmacists in having a broad view of genetic variants that may be implicated in the likelihood of developing certain diseases. Our focus here is to create a comprehensive database with mobile access to all available, authentic and actionable genes, SNPs, and classified diseases and drugs collected from different clinical and genomics databases worldwide, including Ensembl, GenCode, ClinVar, GeneCards, DISEASES, HGMD, OMIM, GTR, CNVD, Novoseek, Swiss-Prot, LncRNADisease, Orphanet, GWAS Catalog, SwissVar, COSMIC, WHO, and FDA. We present a new cutting-edge gene-SNP-disease-drug mobile database with a smart phone application, integrating information about classified diseases and related genes, germline and somatic mutations, and drugs. Its database includes over 59 000 protein-coding and noncoding genes; over 67 000 germline SNPs and over a million somatic mutations reported for over 19 000 protein-coding genes located in over 1000 regions, published with over 3000 articles in over 415 journals available at the PUBMED; over 80 000 ICDs; over 123 000 NDCs; and over 100 000 classified gene-SNP-disease associations.

It was only in the last century that the discovery of antibiotics freed us from many of the dreaded diseases of the past. Today, we stand on the threshold of the new medical revolution, just as big and far-reaching. Despite of all our scientific knowledge, much of medicine today is still based on the conventional symptomatic treatment and performing learned trials for symptom relief, which works for most patients but not all. The current medical model is based on disease classification, which is routinely composed of data from healthcare units brought from different streams, which includes imaging, pathology, genomics, electrophysiology, and others. 2 Treating on symptomatic basis can be complex for multifaceted and multisymptomatic conditions. However, genetic research can assist in producing individual treatment solutions, rather than what works for the average person, and with a precise understanding of who is at risk for critical diseases like diabetes, high blood pressure, or cancer. This will bring systematic approach to healing, allowing for rapid disease detection at an early stage, accurate characterization of disease, and assign preventive measures needed before the disease even appears. Also, timely discovery and association of genetic variants with diseases will help develop a more effective therapy tailored to an individual's precise genetic makeup, reducing adverse drug reactions. As biological data accumulates at larger scales and at exponential rates, because of higher-throughput and lower-cost DNA sequencing technologies, it has become essential to develop innovative, smart, and modern bioinformatics applications to help improve research quality and data sharing.

The human genome contains 3 billion bps that form tens of thousands of genes, yet its complex structure is made up of only four molecules: adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G), and thymine (T). 7 Most genes direct our cells to make a specific protein necessary for some function, and collections of proteins with other organic molecules perform all the tasks needed for life, for example, cell signaling, building body structures, and fighting diseases. Most human genes have a discontinuous structure, with the protein coding regions, or exons, interrupted by noncoding regions, or introns. 8 An average human gene has nine exons, and the longest known human gene called titin (TTN) has 365 exons spanning 109 224 bp and encodes a protein comprising 35 991 amino acids. 9 For a long period of time, researchers used a broad estimate of gene count at more than 50 000 genes, including 21 000 protein-coding genes. 10 However, this number has been repeatedly overturned with advancements in genetics and genomics research.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 65, "end": 66, "text": "3", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 143, "end": 145, "text": "1,", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 146, "end": 148, "text": "4,", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 149, "end": 150, "text": "5", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 289, "end": 290, "text": "6", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 691, "end": 692, "text": "7", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1089, "end": 1090, "text": "8", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1268, "end": 1269, "text": "9", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1411, "end": 1413, "text": "10", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "INTRODUCTION"}, {"text": "The completion of the Human Genome Project 11,12 was a major scientific development in human genomics and biomedical sciences. Its findings suggested that all humans are 99.9% genetically identical and only 0.1% of genetic variations are responsible for the phenotypic differences, such as physical traits (eg, height, intelligence, hair, and eye color), disease susceptibility, and drug responses, among individuals in populations. 13 The human genome harbors enormous gene-encoded protein diversity and expression differences, and variability between individuals due to DNA polymorphisms that underlay the differences between us, which importantly can impart susceptibility to certain diseases and resistance to medications. A major goal of medical genetics is to identify genes that when altered lead to human disease, but not all-recognizable DNA sequence alterations result in disease. 14 Most alterations, or mutations, are simple differences, such as restriction fragment length polymorphisms, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), that may not change the expression or coding of a gene, but some specific mutations can change gene instructions, and ultimately create a protein malfunction, which may cause disease. Human variability is dynamic and fundamental to the survival and advancement of humans. Genetic variations are the differences in DNA sequence within the genome of individuals in populations. 15 Their discovery dates back to 1950s when association studies to link specific variants in biological candidate genes to disease risk emerged. 16 If we can identify which genetic variations are associated with specific diseases, we will be better equipped to find new treatments and even cures. Also identifying genetic variations will help us better understand why some people respond differently to similar medications. Comparisons of frequencies of genetic variants among affected and unaffected individuals revealed correlations between bloodgroup antigens and peptic ulcer disease 17 ; in the 1960s and 1970s, common variation at the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) locus was associated with autoimmune and infectious diseases 18 ; and in the 1980s, apolipoprotein E was implicated in the etiology of Alzheimer's disease. 19 Still, only about a dozen extensively reproduced associations of common variants were identified in the 20th century. 20 In general, mutations can be grouped into two different types: germline and somatic. 20 Germline mutations are variations found in all cells of an organism, including germ line cells. They play an important role in evolution by giving every human its unique genetic makeup but also give rise to hereditary diseases. Somatic mutations are not inherited but acquired during lifetime in somatic cells of an organism and might cause tissue-specific tumors. They are present in the genomes of all dividing cells, both normal and neoplastic. They occur as a result of misincorporation during DNA replication or through exposure to exogenous or endogenous mutagens. 21 Cancer, as a disease of genome alterations, arises through the sporadic acquisition of multiple somatic mutations. 22 All cancers arise as a result of the acquisition of these abnormalities, including base substitutions, deletions, amplifications, and rearrangements. The extent to which each of these mechanisms contributes to cancer varies markedly between different genes, and also between different cancer types.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 433, "end": 435, "text": "13", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 891, "end": 893, "text": "14", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 1417, "end": 1419, "text": "15", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 1562, "end": 1564, "text": "16", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 2005, "end": 2007, "text": "17", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 2149, "end": 2151, "text": "18", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 2244, "end": 2246, "text": "19", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 2365, "end": 2367, "text": "20", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 2453, "end": 2455, "text": "20", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 3027, "end": 3029, "text": "21", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 3145, "end": 3147, "text": "22", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "INTRODUCTION"}, {"text": "Early efforts to analyze common variations in the genome were hampered by lack of a reference genome and costeffective means of identifying, or genotyping, SNPs. 23 In the early 2000s, cheaper genotyping technologies enabled the availability of vast number of SNPs, which provided the first needed map with information about the genetic relatedness of SNPs by The SNP Consortium 24 and launched the HapMap project of human genetic variation. 25 Today, genetic mutations responsible for thousands of conditions, such as cancer, hypertension, and heart diseases, have been identified by scientists. These associations cannot be easily deciphered, because they are often impacted by interactions between dozens of different genes, many of which are caused by single gene elements and the environment. To identify these complex and widely prevalent elements, scientists may have to profile the genetic signatures of thousands of people, even multiple populations, and not just a few individuals. This high density of genotype data allows for unraveling the clinical and therapeutic relevance of genetic variants. The genomic and epigenomic (chemically modified genome) 26 interpretation has led to the fundamentals of development and progression of human diseases, 27 categorized as multifactorial, mitochondrial, 28 chromosomal, 29 and monogenic 30 diseases. All human disease classifications are maintained by the World Health Organization (WHO) with the standard creation of International Classification of Disease (ICD) codes and their related medications organized by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the form of National Drug Code (NDC) codes (applicable in the United States). With the emergence of new-generation gene sequencing techniques, numerous databases have surfaced for gene annotation. They are accessible through web and desktop interfaces and claim to provide information about genes and related diseases, for example, Disease Ontology, 31 DiseaseEnhancer, 32 DISEASES, 33 DisGeNET, 34 eDGAR, 35 GeneCard, 36 Genetic Testing Registry (GTR), 37 MalaCard, 38 Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM), 39 miR2Disease, 40 Human Gene Mutation Database (HGMD), 41 Disease Network Database (DNetDB), 42 ClinVar, 43 Orphanet, 44 Gene2Function, 45 Swiss-Prot, 46 LncRNADisease, 47 Lnc2Cancer v.20, 48 and so on.

Artificial intelligence (AI) and internet of things (IoT) is becoming one of the landmark developments in personalized and public health. 50, 51 Millions of AI-and IoT-based medical devices (eg, sensors, actuators, smartphones, tablets, wearable devices, laptops, etc) are in use worldwide, with effective responses. 52 Its applications include patient's activity tracking systems, 53,54 monitoring physiological signals (eg, heart rate, electrocardiography, body temperature, position, and blood pressure), 55 observing environmental conditions 56 and object detection, 57,58 and many more. Still, there is no AI-and IoT-based solution available, which can facilitate precision medicine and clinical genomics research with detailed information about all available and actionable genes, somatic and germline mutations, and integrating ICD and NDC lists in an effective way. Millions of people worldwide getting their DNA sequenced and would like to have information about their genomics profiles, which includes information about their genes and mutations, when most of the people are unable to interpret such information.

Potential errors in the usage of ICD codes lie more with their specificity, which is a result of formulation and designing based on disease nomenclature, 75,76 misdiagnosis, 77 and documentation in electronic and paper records. 78 The degree to which the severity of these consequences is realized depends on the education of medical professionals and availability of tools to increase the awareness on code applicability and potential discrepancy sources. 79 In the United States, the FDA maintains NDC for uniquely labeling and identifying commercially available drug products. NDC is composed of FDA-assigned code labels: product codes to identify specific drug strength, dosage strength, and formulation; and package codes to categorize package sizes and types. These codes are well adopted in the United States, especially among pharmaceutical manufacturers, wholesalers, healthcare institutions, Medicaid, Medicare, and managed care organizations for inventory control, identification of potential drug-drug interactions, medical precautions and drug claims, utilization, review, physician order entry, and clinical patient profile screening and counseling. Like ICD codes, NDC codes have also been inspected for quality and comprehensiveness by the FDA in the United States. 80, 81 Most medical professionals have to memorize these healthcare codes or consult a reference book or a website when needed.

Drawing on patient-based classified clinical entities of interest often requires iterative code-based searches in medical databases and help from clinical experts. The resultant information could lead to a particular disease condition as a combination of codes representing diagnoses, symptoms, prescribed drugs, and diagnostic tests, as well as a simple code or list. In such cases, our app aims to assist clinicians and researchers with easy navigation and free portable access to diagnostic and drug codes for efficient and quick disease and drug classifications. Individual practices can also benefit from PAS with better metrics to measure their performance relative to their peers, contain costs, spot disease risks, identify patients in need of immediate disease management, and uncover opportunities for greater efficiency. This will enable physicians to funnel the right patients into the right programs, and better refine disease management for those already in a program, outreach to the patients to deliver preventative care versus more serious and costly care when a condition becomes an emergency.

We are entering the era of personalized medicine in which an individual's genetic makeup will eventually determine how a doctor can tailor his or her therapy. Therefore, it is becoming critical to understand the genetic basis of common diseases, for example, which genes predispose individuals to diseases, which gene interactions affect disease risk, and how do rare genetic variants contribute to diseases? Human diseases are at the heart of extensive research encompassing genomics, bioinformatics, systems biology, and systems medicine. To get new insights into disease taxonomy, etiology, and pathogenesis, it is important to understand how diseases are related to each other. 42 In the past, various efforts have been made in deciphering diseases to facilitate predictive diagnosis and thereby guide treatment factors, which include drawing disease relationships using clinical manifestations, 118 healthcare records, images and data generated using wearable technology and AI, 50 along with information encapsulated within related genes, 122 signaling, 123 and metabolic pathways, [124] [125] [126] microRNAs, 127 chemo-centric views, 128 phenotypic characteristics, microbes, 129 and proteins. 132 Differences among humans can be divided into two broad categories: biological and environmental. Variation is inherent in humans and it is the result of fundamental biological and environmental processes, ensuring vitality, ability to adapt to changing environments and even the very survival. The former includes genetic mutations, while the environment induces somatic mutations. A typical gene can have a multitude of variants that have not yet been documented to have a relationship with a disease or a phenotype.

Scientists are faced with the daunting challenge of identifying candidate genes that are relevant to their biological system of interest. Most often, the researcher only has direct knowledge of a few, if any, candidate genes. The clinical interpretation of the significance of specific gene variants can be unique to a patient. Variability in interpretation for sequence variants is due, in part, to the lack of standard curated information to support clinical decision making. 1 Currently, the investigation of existing databases is required to assess the potential significance of even one sequence variant, and that is a cumbersome, time-consuming, and increasingly unfeasible process with regard to the identification and reports of variants in actionable genes because of the absence of a standard centralized platform for connecting genes to their disease phenotypes. 135 In this study, we present our research to collect, explore, and share genes and disease information to support pathology and epidemiology for the implementation of precision medicine.
