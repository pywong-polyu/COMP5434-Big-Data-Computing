Key challenges in using PPI for health economics methods research relate to (1) training and preparation, (2) maintaining involvement, and (3) selecting suitable tasks. We suggest three criteria for selecting a research task for PPI input based on task importance, professional researcher skills gap, and potential PPI contribution.",

The article starts with a brief overview of PPI and methods research in health economics. We then describe our research project and experience of using PPI. Drawing on our experience, the remainder of the article discusses issues in PPI in health economics methods research. PPI has grown substantially over the last 2 decades and is increasingly required for health research in the UK [4] and elsewhere [5, 6] . It can be used in various stages of the life cycle of a research project from prioritising research questions through to impact evaluation [7] . PPI has been used in various ways in health economics, including in support of priority setting [3] , setting the scope of costs and outcomes [2] , selecting health states for valuation [1] , and identifying approaches to collecting cost and outcome data [2] . It is important to distinguish PPI from qualitative research (an important parallel development in health economics [8] ) in the sense that PPI is research done in partnership with the public, rather than using the public as participants. PPI covers 'the experience of patients, service users and carers [as] a fundamental and valued source of knowledge' [9] . Various benefits of using PPI in health economics have been noted, including covering gaps in knowledge, embedding the voice of the public in research, ensuring tasks are presented in an appropriate format, and providing an economic explanatory framework [1] [2] [3] .",

Methods research seeks to develop techniques for application across the discipline, and therefore the intended impact is improved science conducted by the research community. Conversely, applied health economics research focuses on directly informing how health and social care services can be efficiently and equitably delivered. Thus the intended impacts are on the provision of services by care professionals for members of the public. While both methods and applied research can ultimately impact on the delivery of care, the impact of methods research is indirect, and therefore the research goals may be more abstract from the public perspective. Second, methods research is often undertaken as a standalone project, and therefore there may be a need to establish a bespoke PPI group. Conversely, applied health economics research is often nested within a clinical study. As such, it can benefit from PPI which is undertaken as part of the wider clinical study. In the next section we discuss the input of a bespoke PPI group (the lived experience advisory panel [LEAP]) as part of a standalone health economics methods project.",

The group included individuals who had fed into the design of the project, particularly in terms of how PPI would be used and how the project was communicated. The LEAP members were recruited through charity organisations in mental health and dementia and, in one case, via a colleague. As far as possible we sought diversity in caring experiences (e.g. care for spouses, adult children, and parents, and in the home and outside). The group's size was based on a desire to reflect the diversity of caring experiences while ensuring participants felt involved and able to contribute throughout the process.

The LEAP completed early versions of the surveys. Terminology, in relation to mental health issues, was amended to improve clarity. The timescales and format The aim of the programme was to develop a framework for measuring and valuing carer quality of life for economic evaluation. This comprised investigations of The mechanisms behind carer quality-of-life spillovers (work package 1) The validity of different quality-of-life measures with carers (work package 2) The valuation of carer quality of life (work package 3) Inclusion of carer and patient quality of life in economic evaluation (work package 4) The main clinical contexts for the work were mental health, dementia, and stroke, three areas associated with major, though differing, challenges for family carers Methods A LEAP was established to engage individuals with recent experience of family care. LEAP members were recruited via charities in each of the three clinical areas. The LEAP included individuals with experience of caring for adult children, spouses, and parents, within the home and outside the home. Four of the five individuals had been involved in research before as a lay participant and two were involved in conducting research themselves. Twelve 1-day meetings (2016-2019) were held to coincide with relevant work and led by HA. Panel members were reimbursed for their time and expenses using INVOLVE guidelines. The meetings focused on recruitment strategies (e.g. for the interviews and Delphi), the language and content of research materials (including questionnaires and participant information sheets), the process of interviews and focus groups, the interpretation of study findings, and dissemination strategies. Each meeting had a major focus (e.g. participant recruitment), with supplementary issues discussed. Some preparation was needed for the meetings. Detailed notes and actions were written up by the academic researchers. A member of the LEAP also sat on the scientific advisory panel for the project",

Participant recruitment Recruitment to focus groups and interviews was expanded and facilitated by contacts in the LEAP 2. Interview process The process of the focus groups and interviews was influenced by the LEAP; this included the location, terminology, socio-demographic mix, prompts (to ensure focus), brevity of questions, use of flip charts, and 'magic bullet question' 3. Coding The early coding of transcripts built on the perspectives of the LEAP 4. Questionnaire design Survey questions were amended in various ways, including to ensure appropriate terminology and clarity (especially around mental health). Changes were made to response categories, question ordering, and question content (including removal of question on 'strain'). The timescales and format of reminders to complete the survey was also informed by the LEAP 5. Delphi study design In the Delphi survey, a number of elements were amended, including the instructions (e.g. in relation to how long the survey was likely to take), language, use of open responses, formatting of feedback information, and the 'prioritisation task' 6. Think-aloud interview In the 'think-aloud' study, the number of instruments included (maximum of three), the handling of upsetting questions, and ways of handling the presence of the care recipient was informed by the LEAP 7. PTO design The PTO tasks were made more comprehensible. The LEAP encouraged us to use PTO rather than DCE, and estimate equivalence values through iterative rather than direct methods. Instructions were amended to standardise information. Graphical methods (scales and stick people), worked examples, and the scale and duration of benefit were all informed by the discussion with the LEAP 8. Dissemination The work on 'IMPACT' mechanisms was disseminated to various health and care organisations, NHS trusts, and charities on the recommendation of the LEAP. The format and language used in dissemination was influenced by the LEAP. Further contact and face-to-face presentations have resulted from the dissemination Discussion and conclusion The LEAP played a particularly important role in opening up new avenues for recruitment and dissemination and making research surveys more accessible for participants. The latter was challenging because the surveys required participants to make difficult trade-offs, between, for example, improving the lives of patients and carers. An important objective of the research was to ensure carers could answer questions about their own quality of life openly and honestly, and the input of the LEAP was important in achieving this",

The LEAP made numerous contributions to ensuring the research project was more effective (see study results). However, there were also important lessons in terms of how to best prepare for the work, maintain involvement over a period of time, and ensure tasks are appropriate for us to work on jointly. The LEAP involvement gave the participants the experience and motivation to become involved in future PPI and research activity. This is worth stressing because the expansion of PPI nationally will require a greater number of such participants of reminders to complete the survey were also informed by the LEAP. In later meetings, the LEAP piloted and helped to refine the Delphi survey. This influenced the instructions (e.g. in relation to how long the survey was likely to take), language, use of open responses, formatting of feedback information, and the 'prioritisation task'. The LEAP also contributed in a similar way to designing the PTO study (to value carer quality of life) [17] . In this case, the LEAP completed a lengthy initial survey with both discrete choice experiment (DCE) and PTO tasks, formatted in various ways to try to identify the most feasible method. This work was followed by in-depth discussion between the LEAP and academic team, which helped us identify that an iterative PTO task was the most viable option. Graphical methods (scales and stick people), worked examples, and the scale and duration of benefit were all informed by the discussion with the LEAP. Towards the end of the project, the LEAP completed an online version of the PTO task, as part of the process of moving to the final experiment.",

In our study, the team (i.e. LEAP and academics) had initial discussions about the purpose of the project and how PPI could inform this. However, some lay participants reflected that more upfront training would have helped them feel more reassured about their input. Discussions within our team also revealed differing expectations of timescales and understanding about how PPI would fit into a research project. Training needs include research methods (and timescales), as well as health economics, with specific training (e.g. in outcome valuation) added on as needed. Written materials that came to light during the project [19, 20] could also be a useful supplement to more interactive training. To avoid duplication, it might be helpful to develop online training modules that all PPI participants could have access to. Making PPI work also requires efforts from academic researchers. Two of the academic team trained in qualitative research methods. However, in common with most health economists, the academic team had not been exposed to PPI through their training and career development. As with lay participants, a combination of written materials and interactive training would undoubtedly help. Specific areas of training could include the following: the practicalities of recruiting and communicating with lay participants, running tasks, facilitating group discussion, safeguarding welfare, handling different perspectives, and ending a research project.",

This created a sense of cohesion and familiarity that encouraged involvement. However, when people do drop out of PPI groups, this needs to be carefully handled, recognising there may be a trade-off between replacing a lost perspective in the group and maintaining the group's identity. We found it particularly useful that several of the panel had experience of research before either as a lay member or through other means. This enabled them to bridge the lay and academic worlds to some extent, helping others in the group to feel at ease. Of course, having lay participants with research experience may not always be helpful, particularly if some members feel alienated through a lack of research experience.

First, the task must be necessary in meeting the research goals of the project. This may sound obvious, but it means that tasks should not be invented for the purposes of PPI. This creates unnecessary work for everyone and undermines the legitimacy of PPI. Second, the task should be one where the academic research team alone have a knowledge or skills gap. It would not really make sense, for example, for PPI participants to execute analysis that the researchers are trained and experienced in, simply for the sake of it. Third, the lay participants should have some additional knowledge or skills, in relation to the task, above that which the professional researchers possess. This means a task will not necessarily be suitable for PPI just because the academic team are struggling with it-there should be a reasonable expectation that PPI participants can bring additional insights to the task.

As documented in Sect. 2, the LEAP members were helpful in identifying carers and care professionals we could include, where to access them, and how to approach them. PPI participants will often have first-hand experience of these organisations, personal networks, and an awareness of how open such organisations might be to research involvement.

We found that effective PPI required careful preparation, steps to maintain involvement in the project, and the careful selection of tasks. Research tasks will only add value if they are central to the research objectives and in areas where academic researchers have a knowledge or skills gap that the PPI can fill. This is particularly important in health economics methods research where the steps and tasks might be quite abstract to the lay public. A significant feature of our lay panel was that it was composed of family carers. This is a group whose voice is often under-represented, and their role in this research study was especially relevant, given its focus on the quality of life of family carers. The LEAP provided a valuable opportunity for members to discuss the impact on their own well-being, rather than their role as a provider of care to a patient. These discussions were facilitated by a smaller PPI group, which we felt led to carers feeling more comfortable sharing their own concerns. The group size may need to be larger for projects where a high level of diversity is needed or for certain research tasks, for example, if extensive cointerviewing is needed. Global and national pressures on family carers, including coronavirus disease (COVID-19), inadequate social care provision, and ageing populations, mean the importance of involving family carers in PPI will remain and is likely to grow.",

Many of the principles for best practice will be relevant regardless of the focus of the research project. Others have highlighted the need for clear aims and objectives and to ensure appropriate tasks are selected [1, 2] . The fact that PPI is most successful when members can contribute actively is also underscored by Gibson et al. [28] , who highlight PPI as a dynamic interaction between lay and professional knowledge. However, health economics methods research involves perhaps paying even more careful attention to preparation and task selection, given the more abstract nature of the work. PPI requires significant resources, both from lay participants and academics, and ultimately the funder and society. It is therefore legitimate to ask how value-for-money can be maximised.",
