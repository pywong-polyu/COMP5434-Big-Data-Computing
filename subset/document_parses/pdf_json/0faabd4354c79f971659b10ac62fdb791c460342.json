            "text": "Cycle threshold (Ct) is a value that emerges during Real-TimeReverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) tests and is considered a gold standard for detecting SARS-CoV-2. The Ct value refers to the number of cycles taken to detect the virus. The lesser number of cycles taken implies a higher viral load and vice versa, and a high viral load (Ct score <30) is 'believed' to correlates with increased infectivity and severity of the disease [1] . However, there is still no conclusive proof for a direct correlation between the Ct values and the disease severity and infectivity. The Ct values differ from one test kit to another, with the method of sample collection and transport, the competence of a technician, calibration of the equipment, and analytical skills of the interpreter [1] .",

We checked their Ct values and lineage of SARS-CoV-2 by Genome sequencing (done at the National Centre for Disease Control, New Delhi) from their nasopharyngeal samples. The majority (72.9%) of them had Ct values of <30, indicating a high viral load, and the Delta variant (B1.617.2 lineage) was the most prevalent at 68.6%. This high incidence coincided with the substantial presence of the Delta variant in our population during the study period [4] . All of these HCWs were pre-vaccinated with ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 Recombinant vaccine. None of them required ICU admission, and there were no fatalities. Only two required hospital admission for a short duration.",
