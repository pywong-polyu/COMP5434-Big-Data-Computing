Methods Participants with T2DM were grouped according to the presence of peripheral neuropathy as assessed by vibration perception threshold (VPT). Recruitment ensured groups were balanced for age, sex and body mass index (BMI). Bone health was measured by calcaneal quantitative ultrasound (QUS) and compared between groups. Calcaneal QUS parameters were correlated across the cohort with VPT and other prespecified variables. Results Thirty-four participants (17 per group) were included with mean age 68 \u00b1 12 years, 47% male, with median BMI 29.9 (IQR 26.9-32.7) kg/m 2 . The peripheral neuropathy group had significantly lower mean Stiffness Index (87 \u00b1 12 versus 101 \u00b1 16, p = 0.01), Speed of Sound (1542 \u00b1 28 versus 1574 \u00b1 34 m/s, p < 0.01), and a trend towards lower Broadband Ultrasound Attenuation (113 \u00b1 10 versus 120 \u00b1 12 dB/MHz, p = 0.07). Pedal bone health asymmetry was not a significant feature in those with peripheral neuropathy. All calcaneal QUS parameters correlated negatively with VPT, although significance of the relationship with Broadband Ultrasound Attenuation was nullified if controlled for diabetes duration or time on insulin. Broadband Ultrasound Attenuation showed independent negative correlation with diabetes duration. Conclusions People with T2DM and peripheral neuropathy have poorer bone health as measured by calcaneal QUS than those without peripheral neuropathy, independent of age, sex and BMI.",

            "text": "Poor bone health is increasingly recognised as a complication of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The pathophysiological mechanisms are complex and contentious, with obesity and insulin resistance observed to have varied effects on bone, and oxidative stress and microvascular disease likely detrimental to bone health in the later stages of T2DM [1, 2] . A recent meta-analysis found that T2DM is associated with significantly increased risk of hip and vertebral fractures [3] . Of particular interest, the greatest elevation of fracture risk in T2DM was seen at the foot, where relative risk was 37% higher than comparator populations without T2DM, raising the potential involvement of peripheral neuropathy in fracture predisposition. Reported predictors of fracture are generally surrogates of disease severity, such as older age, longer diabetes duration, higher glycosylated haemoglobin and insulin use. Therefore, unravelling the contribution of peripheral neuropathy to fracture risk is problematic in large epidemiological studies.",

In contrast, calcaneal quantitative ultrasound (QUS) is specifically designed to measure bone health at the heel and is portable, affordable and easy to use [12] . Utility for fracture risk prediction in T2DM is comparable to bone densitometry, and therefore this tool has potential application in screening [13] . Vibration perception threshold (VPT) is widely recommended in screening for clinically relevant diabetes-related peripheral neuropathy [14, 15] .

The latter was used to guide recruitment, ensuring similarity in age, sex and body mass index (BMI) between groups. All potential participants were provided with details of the study, and, if interested, they were recruited. Signed informed consent was obtained. Final group allocation was based on the average of bilateral VPT with peripheral neuropathy defined at or above 25 V. The threshold of 25 V is commonly used in clinical studies to indicate high risk of foot ulceration [16] , and a VPT above this threshold is abnormal irrespective of age [17] . The sample size was set at 20 participants per group based on previous similar studies [18] ; however, ultimately the COVID-19 pandemic hindered recruitment. Data collection was cross sectional, with all assessments and measurements performed in a single visit by the same investigator (JL). First, clinical data were collected including demographics, diabetes history, fracture history, age of menopause (if relevant), current medications, previous exposure to antiresorptive, corticosteroid or hormone therapies, calcium and vitamin D supplementation, smoking status, alcohol consumption and physical activity (assessed by International Physical Activity Questionnaire) [19] . Second, anthropometry and foot sensation were assessed, including 4-point monofilament and VPT using methods outlined by Boulton et al. (2008) [20] . VPT was measured by calibrated Biothesiometer, Bio-Medical Instrument Co (Ohio, US).

In contrast, BUA theoretically incorporates assessment of bone quality or microarchitecture as the refraction of ultrasound reflects the degree of porosity. Our data therefore suggests the overall SI, which is an amalgamation of SOS and BUA, was primarily driven by lower bone density. Further, asymmetry was not a significant feature in those with peripheral neuropathy. This supports the hypothesis that osteopenia is a consequence of rather than a predisposing factor to acute Charcot foot [9] .

The groups were well characterised with respect to both diabetes characteristics and peripheral neuropathy, as compared to retrospective population-based studies. A single investigator performed all measurements ensuring consistency, and very high QUS reliability and precision was proven. Given the absence of blinding, the relatively subjective assessment of VPT was recorded prior to calcaneal QUS measurement, which is objective. Power was limited by the relatively small number of participants, although the sample size per group was not dissimilar to previous comparable studies. The cross-sectional study design does not allow for exploration of causality. There was a potential for selection bias, although all eligible clinic attendees were approached within the limits of the study methodology. Finally, only post-menopausal women were recruited, primarily given that peripheral neuropathy as a time-dependent complication of T2DM is more common in this age group.",

Assuming our findings are reproducible, several clinically relevant hypotheses are raised. Peripheral neuropathy may partly explain the higher risk of pedal fractures in T2DM as compared to the general population and also contribute to the complex pathophysiology that underlies Charcot foot. Bone health may simply be a marker of disease severity and detrimental effects of hyperglycaemia on bone. However, perhaps poor pedal bone health is a manifestation of microvascular ischaemic disease, denervation, hyperinsulinaemia and/or insulin resistance.",

Peripheral measures of bone health are less likely to be representative of general bone health when peripheral neuropathy is present. In this case, central DXA may be more relevant. While we have previously shown that QUS is predictive of any low trauma fracture in T2DM [13] , specific relevance to foot fracture and Charcot foot prediction would require further evaluation. Of interest, if QUS could be used to identify those at greatest risk of Charcot foot prior to its onset, there may be opportunity for preventative action. Finally, it is unclear whether interventions commonly used in managing osteopenia reduce fracture risk in T2DM, particularly if peripheral neuropathy is contributing to bone health deterioration.",
