The main route of transmission remains human-to-human. However, there is evidence that the virus can infect animals (Prince et al., 2021) and it is important that we remain vigilant of such infections; particularly in companion animals with whom humans often have close contact.",

Evidence of infection of cats and dogs has also been provided by the detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in several studies worldwide Michelitsch et al., 2020 Michelitsch et al., , 2021 Patterson et al., 2020a; Stevanovic et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2020) . Experimental infections have shown that cats and, to a lesser extent, dogs are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 and that cats can transmit the virus to other cats (Bosco-Lauth et al., 2020; Halfmann et al., 2020; Shi et al., 2020) . Infections in companion animals appear to have occurred as a result of human-to-animal transmission; however, the reported transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from farmed mink to in-contact humans, cats and dogs (Oude Munnink et al., 2021; van Aart et al., 2021) and the detection of the virus in stray dogs and cats (Dias et al., 2021; Villanueva-Saz et al., 2021) , suggest it is important to continue surveillance in companion animals. Here we conducted a survey of SARS-CoV-2 neutralising antibodies in cats and dogs attending UK veterinary practices.",

Serum samples collected from the same laboratory in early January 2020 were also tested as pre-COVID-19 controls. All samples were linked to electronic health data for that sample (species, breed, sex, postcode of the submitting veterinary practice, date received by the diagnostic laboratory) held in the SAVSNET database, using a unique anonymised identifier. Data on SARS-CoV-2 exposure or symptoms was not available.

Briefly, sera were heat inactivated at 56 C for 30 min and stored at \u00c020 C until use. DMEM containing 2% FBS was used to dilute sera ten-fold followed by serial two-fold dilution. SARS-CoV-2 at 800 plaque forming units (PFU)/ml was added to diluted sera and incubated at 37 C for 1 h. The virus/serum mixture was then inoculated onto Vero E6 cells, incubated at 37 C for 1 h, and overlaid as in standard plaque assays (Rossi et al., 2015) . Cells were incubated for 48 h at 37 C and 5% CO 2 , fixed with 10% formalin and stained with 0.05% crystal violet solution. PRNT 80 was determined by the highest dilution with 80% reduction in plaques compared to the control. Samples with detectable neutralising antibody titre were repeated as technical replicates for confirmation. Where titres differed between technical replicates, the lowest dilution was reported. ",

Results are therefore reported for 688 sera (454 canine, 234 feline) of which 558 (372 dogs, 186 cats) were collected during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and 130 (82 dogs, 48 cats) were collected from animals before the first confirmed human case in the UK (21 st January 2020 (Lillie et al., 2020) ) -pre-COVID-19 samples; these samples were distributed across the UK (Fig. 1) . Of the dog sera collected during the pandemic, 0/85 (0%) collected in March/April 2020 and 4/287 (1.4%) collected September 2020-February 2021 tested positive for neutralising antibodies with titres of 1:20 (n \u00bc 2) and 1:80 (n \u00bc 2).

            "text": "Studies of companion animals have shown that they can be infected with SARS-CoV-2 (Prince et al., 2021) . In the UK, there have been sporadic reports of infection in cats and dogs, including one that tested 387 cats showing respiratory signs using RT-PCR and found one cat to be positive for the virus (Hosie et al., 2021; Ferasin et al., 2021) . However, there has been no large scale sero-survey of infection. Here we show that a small proportion of UK dogs and cats, sampled at a time of active human transmission, tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 neutralising antibodies. Sera from two time points during the pandemic were analysed. Sera collected during March and April 2020 (first wave) from both cats and dogs were negative for neutralising antibodies. Previous studies using European samples have shown a low level of infection, highest in Italy, where 3.3% (15/451) of dog sera and 5.8% (11/191) cat sera collected between March and May 2020 had measurable neutralising antibody titres (Patterson et al., 2020a) . These samples were purposefully collected from regions of Italy with a high prevalence of infection in humans, in some cases from households known to contain recently diagnosed human cases. Our results in contrast, are more consistent with a survey from a similar population of cats in Germany, that found 0/221 samples collected in April and May of 2020 to be positive for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies using ELISA (Michelitsch et al., 2020) , and with a survey in the Netherlands in April-May 2020, that found 0.4% of cats and 0.2% of dogs to be seropositive (Zhao et al., 2021a) . The lack of positive samples from March-April 2020 in the UK, that we report here, likely reflects the selection criteria of the animals assayed (undergoing routine haematological testing and not selected based on location), and the relatively low rate of human disease at the time compared to Italy.",

Positive dog samples were collected in November 2020 and January and February of 2021. Positive cat samples were collected in January 2021. This is again broadly in line with a recent German survey conducted from September 2020 to February 2021, showing a seroprevalence of 1.36% (increased from 0.69% earlier in the pandemic), that the authors concluded corresponded with the rise of reported cases in the human population, and was suggestive of ongoing transmission from owners to their cats (Michelitsch et al., 2021) . The detection of neutralising antibodies in dogs and cats during the second wave in this study also likely reflects the increased numbers of humans that had been infected. However, it is unknown whether the main variant circulating in the UK human population during the second wave (B.1.1.7) has altered transmissibility to cats and dogs as it does in humans (Davies et al., 2021) . Whilst there is some work in model species testing new variants in e.g. hamsters (Nunez et al., 2021; Oa Donnell et al., 2021) , to our knowledge none of the early experimental infections performed in cats and dogs using the original SARS-CoV-2 have been repeated with newer variants.",

            "text": "Cats and dogs can be infected with other coronaviruses, leading to the possibility that SARS-CoV-2 neutralising antibodies detected in this study may result from previous infection with a different virus. We and others have previously demonstrated a lack of cross-reactivity between SARS-CoV-2 and samples containing antibodies to feline coronavirus (FCoV), canine enteric coronavirus (CeCoV) and canine respiratory coronavirus (CRCoV) (Michelitsch et al., 2020; Patterson et al., 2020a; Stevanovic et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2020) . The reverse has also been demonstrated whereby cat or dog samples containing antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 did not react with known feline or canine coronavirus antigens (Michelitsch et al., 2020; Zhao et al., 2021b ). Here we also tested samples from UK cats and dogs collected before the human index case in the UK (21 st January 2020 (Lillie et al., 2020) ). All pre-COVID-19 samples were negative for SARS-CoV-2 neutralising antibodies. Although there are no recent sero-surveys of cat and dog coronaviruses in the UK (Addie and Jarrett, 1992; Priestnall et al., 2006; Stavisky et al., 2010) , FCoV, CeCoV and CRCoV are considered to be endemic. Furthermore, a recent serological survey in the Netherlands testing for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies also found 71% of cat and 40% of dog pandemic sera to have antibodies to other known cat or dog coronaviruses (Zhao et al., 2021a) . If cross-reactivity of SARS-CoV-2 with antibodies to cat and dog coronaviruses was occurring in the study reported here, this would be apparent in the pre-COVID-19 samples. We would also expect to see higher numbers of animals with SARS-CoV-2 neutralising antibodies in the pandemic samples, again suggesting that antibodies produced following infection by endemic cat and dog coronaviruses do not cross-react with SARS-CoV-2.",

The major limitations of such a system are the relatively sparse data available for each sample such that individual animals, that are not identifiable, may have been sampled twice or have come from the same household. In addition, such samples lack detailed information on the health of the animals and whether they were from a COVID-19-positive household. However, acquiring such samples from the UK Virtual Biobank, offers a responsive resource for studying national patterns of disease in UK pets .",

The use of a neutralisation assay will not detect animals that have sero-converted but not produced neutralising antibodies (such that might test positive by ELISA but not by PRNT). Indeed, other studies have shown that sera positive by ELISA for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies may not have detectable neutralising antibodies (Michelitsch et al., 2020; Zhao et al., 2021b) . As such, our results may underestimate the number of animals exposed to SARS-CoV-2.",

Current Research in Virological Science 2 (2021) 100011 a significant reservoir for infection, and that the pandemic will be controlled by measures largely focussed on minimising human-to-human transmission. Current UK guidance is that COVID-19 positive humans should limit contact with their pets. Studies like that presented here strongly argue for continued surveillance of in-contact, susceptible animal species, particularly with the emergence of new variants, which will help determine whether in the future, more targeted control measures are needed for pet animals, particularly in regions that are gaining control of infection in their human populations.",
