To establish an immune barrier and control the COVID-19 epidemic in the population, COVID-19 vaccination is a key public health strategy. During the previous phase of the epidemic, countries focused on the development of a COVID-19 vaccine, and after the successful launch of the vaccine, vaccination rates have become a global concern as the key to population immunization effectiveness. Acceptability of the COVID-19 vaccine may vary according to several demographic characteristics, among which the individual willingness to vaccinate plays an important role, and a high individual willingness to vaccinate is more likely to increase the acceptability of the COVID-19 vaccine. Mobile populations, as an important group in the spread of the epidemic, should receive extra attention in terms of their vaccination intentions and vaccination rates.",

            "text": "At the end of 2020, China launched the COVID-19 vaccination, and the government has been encouraging the general public to get vaccinated for free. By 18 April 2021, China's total vaccination amount of COVID-19 vaccines was 155 million doses [2] , ranking second in the world, while the United States was the first. However, the coverage rate of the COVID-19 vaccine is only 10%, ranking 49th in the world, which is far lower than 77.6% of the coverage rate needed to build an effective population immunization. Previous studies have shown that personal psychology, social support and behavior change factors play an important role in the intention rate of COVID-19 vaccination. Guidry et al. found that insurance, education, susceptibility to COVID-19, vaccine benefits, scores of vaccine barriers, subjective norms scores, attitudes towards the vaccine and self-efficacy were significant predictors of COVID-19 vaccination intentions [3] . Meanwhile, concerns about the hasty development of the COVID-19 vaccine [3] , fear of needles, concerns about pain during vaccination, lack of family support and concerns about side effects were identified as the reasons for vaccination hesitation [4] . A cross-sectional study in China found that a high perception of the benefits and low perceived barriers to vaccination were the two most important factors influencing a clear intention to vaccinate with COVID-19 [5] . In addition, vaccination history, doctor's advice and convenience of the vaccination all influenced respondents' intention to receive the vaccine immediately, and safety information about vaccination published by an authoritative institution could effectively increase vaccination intentions [6] . Another survey of 27 cities in China showed that income and occupation were important determinants of willingness to receive the free COVID-19 vaccine, and the occupational population with a high risk of COVID-19 infection was the most willing to receive the vaccine [7] . By the end of April, the highest vaccination rate of the COVID-19 vaccine in China was for medical personnel, whose vaccination rate exceeded 80%, but the situation of vaccination for the mobile population was not optimistic. Improving the vaccination rate of the mobile population is the key to prevent virus transmission, and the first thing is to improve the vaccine willingness of the mobile population.",

Graffigna et al. [9] developed two pathway models in their study of COVID-19 vaccination intentions. By examining the effect of health participation on the willingness to vaccinate against COVID-19, a direct pathway between health participation and willingness to vaccinate was established, as well as another indirect pathway mediated by the general attitudes towards vaccination. The study suggests that a multifactorial health behavior model should be used as a basis for research and interventions concerning vaccination intentions [9] . However, there are few surveys on the vaccination intention of the mobile population. In this study, the key factors influencing the vaccination intention of the COVID-19 vaccine were investigated by establishing a clinical prediction model, and the government and related departments can take measures to improve the vaccination intention of the mobile population based on these key factors, so as to improve the vaccination rate of the whole people.",

Participants that answered \"yes\" were classified as having vaccination intention, and those who answered either \"no\" or \"unsure\" were classified as not having vaccination intention. Their personal, psychosocial and behavioral determinants were measured ( Table 1 ). The personal determinants included demographic characteristics such as gender, age, income and education. For the psychosocial determinants survey component, anxiety was measured using the Chinese version of Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) (Cronbach's \u03b1 = 0.960) [12] . Depression was measured by the Chinese version of the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) (Cronbach's \u03b1 = 0.948) [13] . Interpersonal needs were measured by the Chinese version of the Interpersonal Needs Questionnaire (INQ-15) (Cronbach's \u03b1 = 0.829) [14] . All items in the behavioral determinants survey section were rated from 1 \"strongly disagree\" to 7 \"strongly agree\" (Cronbach's \u03b1 = 0.935). General beliefs about vaccination (i.e., I take vaccinations for granted) and past experiences (i.e., I remember which vaccines I have received) constitute the general perceptions about vaccination; self-efficacy (i.e., I would get myself vaccinated with the COVID-19 vaccine if offered), risk perception (i.e., I think there is a risk of serious side effects, such as severe allergic reactions, if I get the COVID-19 vaccine), fear of vaccination (i.e., I am afraid of the injection), perceived benefits (i.e., if I get the COVID-19 vaccine, I am doing so primarily to protect myself), and perceived barriers (i.e., I think the COVID-19 vaccine has a limited duration of protection) comprise the personal perceptions toward COVID-19 vaccination. The perceived support consisted of nine items (i.e., my family believes I should get the COVID-19 vaccine). The ability to receive the COVID-19 vaccine consisted of eight items (i.e., I can tolerate my fear of needles to receive the COVID-19 vaccine). See Table 1 .",

First, the participants were divided into a training set and a testing set for external validation conformed to the ratio of 3:1 with R software. A descriptive statistical analysis, t-test, and chi-square test were performed. The Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression analysis was used to screen the 16 independent variables of the training set to identify the factors. Area under curve (AUC), as one of the measures of LASSO, was used to specify the target covariates that were minimized when cross-validating the selected model. 1-standard error (1-SE) was used to obtain a model with excellent performance and a minimum number of independent variables. After features with nonzero coefficients in the LASSO regression analysis were selected, a multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed on the training set to build the prediction model, which was presented as a nomogram. Based on the training set and the testing set, the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve, Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) test, Lift test and Population Stability Index (PSI) were performed to test the validity and stability of the model and summarize the validation results.",
