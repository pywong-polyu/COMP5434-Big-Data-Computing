We aimed to evaluate whether severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) viral load could predict the clinical course of pediatric patients. This study was conducted retrospectively with medical records of pediatric patients who were tested for SARS-CoV2 between April 12 and October 25, 2020 in the University of Health Sciences, Ankara Educating and Training Hospital and Hacettepe University Faculty of Medicine. We evaluated 518 pediatric patients diagnosed with COVID-19 and classified according to severity as asymptomatic (16.2%), mild (59.6%), moderate (20.2%), and critical/severe (3.9%) cases. We analyzed patients in four groups in terms of ages: <4, 5-9, 10-14, and 15-17 years.",

Our study has indicated that children with COVID-19 have similar amount of viral load in all disease courses irrespective of the age and underlying disease. It should be taken into account that, regardless of the severity of the disease, pediatric patients may have a role in the transmission chain.",

Therefore, identifying the nature of immune system in children may possibly be the key for understanding the COVID-19 pathogenesis, transmission features and finding the treatment options as well as vaccines. Similarly, to the literature, we found that children have relatively high viral load in their upper airways, in the early days of acute COVID-19 24 and asymptomatic patients had similar viral load as severe patients. From an infection control perspective, it is the significant point to identify infected children early and especially in the asymptomatic clinical course for prevention of transmission. Our study has several limitations. First, we could not perform serial sampling for PCR and viral load due to the retrospective nature of the study. Serial sampling would be better to evaluate viral dynamics and shedding patterns and to determine the transmission potential of children with COVID-19. Second, we analyzed only the nasopharyngeal swab fluid no other body fluids, such as sputum, blood, feces, and urine. Persistence and clearance of viral RNA from different patient specimens would give information regarding virus transmission dynamics. Finally, we could not evaluate the relationship between viral load with neutralizing antibodies, cytokines, chemokine, or any host immune system functions of the patients. Further virologic and immunological studies are urgently needed in children regarding how they could cope with COVID-19 better than adults to find the treatment and management strategies of COVID-19 and to understand the role of children in transmission.In conclusion, our study has indicated that children with COVID-19 can carry a similar amount of viral load at all ages irrespective of the clinical course. So, it seems that viral load has no prediction utility in terms of the clinical course of children with COVID-19. As a result, host factors, such as immune response to virus seem one of the further investigating targets in children to understand the actual disease course.",
