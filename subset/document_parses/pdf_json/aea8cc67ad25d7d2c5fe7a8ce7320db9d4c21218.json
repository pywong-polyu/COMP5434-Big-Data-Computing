But while these experiments provide rich, detailed fitness data, theory is mostly used as a conceptual heuristic. Here, we evaluate how kin and multilevel selection theory perform as quantitative analysis tools. We reanalyse published microbial datasets and show that the canonical fitness models of both theories are almost always poor fits because they use statistical regressions misspecified for the strong selection and nonadditive effects we show are widespread in microbial systems. We identify analytical practices in empirical research that suggest how theory might be improved, and show that analysing both individual and group fitness outcomes helps clarify the biology of selection. A data-driven approach to theory thus shows how kin and multilevel selection both have untapped potential as tools for quantitative understanding of social evolution in all branches of life.",

Kin selection theory, for example, has been enormously influential in part because it shows that social evolution can be understood from just a few important quantities: how a behaviour affects the fitness of an actor, how that behaviour affects the fitness of other individuals, and the genetic relatedness between social partners [1, 2] . This theory was developed with a major focus on animal behaviour, so its mathematical form was developed in terms of the quantitative-genetic phenotypes most easily measured in animal systems [3] . Similarly, evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS) models of kin selection were formulated to facilitate predictions and empirical tests using comparative data [4] with substantial success [5] [6] [7] .",

Fitness, for example, is notoriously difficult to measure in multicellular organisms [9] . In microbial systems, though, it is common practice to directly measure the fitness effect of a defined change in genotype or environment under controlled laboratory conditions.

And since meiotic sex is often infrequent or absent, studies of microbial genetics tend to focus on the effects of defined, discrete genotypes instead of quantitative genetic analyses of continuous-valued traits (but see [12] ). It can also be difficult to study microbial behaviour in natural environments, making comparative tests of ESS models rare. So the mathematical formulations of social evolution theory used in metazoan research are poorly suited to the types of data microbiologists most often collect. Perhaps as a result, microbial researchers often use ad hoc methods to analyse and interpret their data, only using theory as a conceptual heuristic or source of qualitative predictions.",

Models are tailored to the richness of available data and then used to make quantitative predictions. Deviation of data from these predictions is then used to refine models in an iterative cycle of improvement. One of the most important results to come out of this theory is a summary statistic called R 0 : the average number of secondary infections from a single infected individual in a wholly susceptible population [13] [14] [15] . R 0 provides an estimate of outbreak population dynamics and pathogen fitness, allows researchers to compare very different infectious agents, and guides public health responses to diseases like SARS [16, 17] , Ebola [18] and COVID-19 [19] .",

One can, for example, compare the fitness of genotypes when they are separate to their fitness when they are allowed to interact. Fitness is typically measured by comparing the initial and final states of an experimental population. In practice, mix experiments examine how selection acts in a local subpopulation during one part of a microbe's life cycle-within a single infected host, for example. Their results can then be used to estimate how selection in a larger metapopulation would depend on genetic social structure at this scale (the distribution of initial genotype frequencies among subpopulations).

A quantitative, data-driven approach can be a productive way forward to identify how theory can best aid our understanding of social evolution in all branches of life.

We included experiments published in the last 20 years that measured the asexual survival and reproduction of strains as a function of their initial frequency, holding constant the total number of individuals. We aimed for breadth of species and social trait, prioritizing studies with several mixing frequencies (initial genotype frequencies) over those with a single 50 : 50 mix. We identified 39 studies with experiments matching our criteria. We sought raw data from journal websites, public data archives and directly from study authors. So that our results would not be overly dominated by a few studies with many experiments, we included a maximum 12 datasets per study, prioritizing those with most replication and covering the observed range of interactions. In all, we obtained 80 datasets from 20 different studies for further analysis (electronic supplementary material, table S1).",

Electronic supplementary material, table S2 summarizes our notation. Kin and multilevel selection are different frameworks for understanding natural selection when individuals interact. For the same biological situation, these theories use different terms to describe which individuals interact and how those interactions affect fitness outcomes. Because social phenotypes are not typically not measured in mix experiments, we use theory formulated in terms of genotypes and fitness. We call these formulations 'canonical' because they are among the most general descriptions of social selection and are common touchpoints in theoretical discussion.",

Many included several rounds of reproduction, which can compound fitness effects across generations and increase their measured magnitude. Canonical theory might perform better over shorter timescales, but measuring and analysing fitness outcomes for individual cells and virions is unlikely to resolve most issues. We found strong non-additive effects, for example, in datasets measuring the survival of starving Myxococcus or Dictyostelium cells to become spores in fruiting bodies with little to no reproduction over the course of the experiment. And in many experiments initial frequency determined which strain was most fit-a result that cannot be caused by independent additive effects of self and neighbour genotype. More generally, biologically important interactions among microbes are often difficult to express in terms of single-generation effects on individual fitness. A key benefit of shared external goods like siderophores and virulence toxins, for example, is often that they increase local carrying capacity to allow further rounds of cell growth and division.

Biologically specific models can help researchers understand the often nontrivial fitness effects of microbial phenotypes [42, 43, 46] . Even fixed differences in reproductive rate or lag time, for example, can have frequency-dependent and non-additive fitness effects when there is local resource competition [47] . Following the time dynamics of mix experiments can be especially informative, as the specificity and richness of time-series data allows strong tests of hypotheses that would otherwise be indistinguishable based on the initial and final time points alone [47] .

It can be a proof of concept to test the verbal logic of hypotheses [49] . It can also be an analytical tool that provides quantitative insight into the biology of a system-epidemiology's R 0 , for example. We found that kin and multilevel selection theory are both conceptually useful for microbial data, but they also both have substantial analytical shortcomings. The early development of these theories explicitly considered microbes [50, 51] , but they have mostly been formulated for metazoan biology. If applying theory developed for one set of taxa to another very different set is a test of that theory's explanatory power, kin and multilevel selection both have room for improvement. Taking a quantitative, data-driven approach can help us move beyond verbal and conceptual arguments to find a productive path where both theories are useful analytical tools for understanding social evolution in all branches of life.",
