The majority of newly sequenced phage genomes are annotated by one or more of several freely-available autoannotation programs. No program has been shown to consistently outperform the others; thus the choice of which program to use is not obvious. We present the software Phage Commander for rapid annotation of phage genomes using multiple auto-annotation programs. Phage Commander runs a phage genome sequence through nine auto-annotation programs and integrates the results within a single output. Phage Commander generates properly formatted output files for direct export to NCBI GenBank. Users can select the threshold for determining which genes should be exported. Phage Commander was benchmarked using eight high-quality phage genomes whose genes have been identified through experiments. Results show that the best results are obtained by exporting genes identified by at least two or three of the nine auto-annotation programs.",

This figure is set to increase, as preliminary evidence suggests that part of the high mortality rate of COVID-19 could be due to opportunistic bacterial infections (2, 3) . Phages are attractive as an alternative to antibiotics because they are effective at lysing their host rapidly, are highly specific to their host and therefore harmless to humans and gut flora, cause few if any side effects, and co-evolve with their host, thereby reducing the chance of their host evolving resistance (4) . Inconsistent early results and the development of highly successful antibiotics such as penicillin led to phages being eclipsed as treatment agents in the West. However, several recent high-profile cases of successful use of phages to resolve antibiotic-resistant infections in the US and UK have generated significant attention and renewed interest in phages as treatment agents (5) (6) (7) . Phages are also becoming increasingly important in agricultural and commercial applications as treatments for infections in livestock and honeybees (8, 9) . They are also the source of a large number of commercial enzymes used in molecular biology (10, 11) .",

The sequencing of a novel phage genome is followed by annotation, which consists of 1) identifying genes, 2) identifying start codons, and 3) assigning putative function to genes (13) . Genes and start codons are usually identified using one or more auto-annotation programs, such as Glimmer (14), GeneMark (15), GeneMark.hmm (16) , GeneMark with Heuristics (17), GeneMarkS (18), GeneMarkS2 (19) , RAST (20) , BASys (21), Prodigal (22) , Prokka (23), MetaGene (24) , and PhANOTATE (25) . Although designed for bacterial genomes (with the exception of PhANOTATE), these programs produce phage genome annotations with roughly 80-90% accuracy (12) , with the added benefit of doing so rapidly. Each of these programs uses a different algorithm and produces unique results. Preliminary work has shown that no program consistently outperforms the others (12) , and, thus the choice of which program to use is not obvious. Many groups combine two or three programs' results and manually interpret their findings to achieve higher accuracy (13, 26) .",

For each gene, the strand, start codon, stop codon, and length are listed. Gene rows are shaded based on how many auto-annotation programs identify that particular gene, with darker shading corresponding to more program calls. The leftmost column is the number of programs that identify a gene; however which programs identify a particular gene may vary. For example, in Figure 1 , gene 70 and gene 90 are both identified by three programs, but not by the same three programs.

Two export options exist: Excel format (.xlsx) and GenBank format (.gb). GenBank formatted files can be directly uploaded to the NCBI GenBank genome repository. In our workflow, we export the genes predicted from Phage Commander in .gb format and read them into the DNA Master software (13) , which we use to assign putative functions.

We identified eight phages genomes that meet this criterion, shown in Table 2 below. The E. coli phage Lambda was isolated in 1950 and is perhaps the most studied phage in existence (27) . Phage Mu is another E. coli phage that has been extensively studied since it was isolated in the early 1960s, and whose genome has been carefully annotated (28) . Phage Patience is a somewhat atypical Mycobacterium smegmatis phage whose genome has been extensively studied through RNA-Seq transcriptomics and mass spectrometry (29) . Phage Kampy is a cluster A4 M. smegmatis phage that has also been studied through transcriptomics and mass spectrometry (30) . Phage Giles is a cluster Q M. smegmatis phage that has been studied through mass spectrometry and whose protein interactome has been mapped out (31) . Phage PAK_P3 is a Pseudomonas aeruginosa phage that has been studied through transcriptomics experiments (32) . Phage YuA is a P. aeruginosa phage that has been studied through mass spectrometry and other experiments (33) . Phage API480 is a phage that infects the bacterium Paenibacillus larvae, a pathogen of the honeybee Apis mellifera, and has been the subject of transcriptomics experiments (34) . The published annotations of these eight phage genomes in NCBI GenBank are considered highly trustworthy and were used as references to benchmark the performance of Phage Commander. A gene that is detected by transcriptomics or mass spectrometry is likely to be real, so we did not remove any genes from the reference annotations. However, even transcriptomics might miss some genes that are rarely expressed. We thus inspected each genome carefully and added one gene to the reference genome of Kampy and two genes to YuA that were identified by all 9 programs, had many statistically significant homologs, and filled a coding gap. For phage Giles, we used the annotation of the closely related phage LilHazelnut (99.99% nucleotide identity), whose annotation is more recent and appears more complete (35) . Lambda has two cases of two genes within the same reading frame, differing only by their start (genes nu3 and D, and genes S and R); we thus counted the duplicate genes as a single gene (i.e. we counted nu3 and D as one gene, and S and R as one gene), because no program has the ability to identify two genes within the same reading frame.",

Genes were identified by requiring 1-9 programs to identify a gene, and the results were compared with the reference annotations in Table  2 . Figures 2 and 3 show the performance of Phage Commander compared with the reference annotations. A false positive is a gene that is identified by one or more programs but that is not present in the reference annotation. A false negative is a gene present in the reference annotation but not detected by the programs. These results show that the sum of false positives and false negatives is usually a minimum when exporting genes called by at least two programs (Patience, Kampy, Giles, YuA), or genes called by at least three programs (Mu, PAK_P3, API480). The results for Lambda are somewhat anomalous due to the high number of false negatives. Thus, either of the \"at least 2 programs\" or \"at least 3 programs\" settings offer the best tradeoff between sensitivity and specificity, with the \"at least 2 programs\" setting favoring sensitivity (fewer false negatives), and the \"at least 3 programs\" setting favoring specificity (fewer false positives). Exporting genes called by at least one program (i.e. all genes identified) will produce a large number of false positives, although it will generate few false negatives. This setting should thus only be used if it is desired to not miss any genes without concern to the presence of false positives in the annotation. Exporting genes only called by more than 4 programs is in the opinion of the authors too stringent and will result in an unacceptably high number of false negatives (typically between 3 and 10). There is also variability between phages, with Lambda having the largest number of false positives and false negatives, and YuA the fewest, even when adjusted for genome length.",

A major component of the manual curation method is how many programs (out of nine) identify a candidate gene when making a gene identification decision (in addition to additional information such as homology, operons, overlap, ribosome binding score, and synteny) (12) . Prior to the development of Phage Commander, phage genomes had to be run through each auto-annotation program separately and the output of each program was manually added into a single spreadsheet. Phage Commander was developed to accelerate the annotation process by automating running the phage genome through the autoannotation programs and outputting the results into a single spreadsheet automatically. By our estimate, using Phage Commander accelerates our workflow by ~33%. Of interest is the relative performance of each of the nine programs used and the manual curation method, which integrates all the programs. In the original publication presenting the method, we benchmarked the method on phages Lambda and Patience (12) . In Figures 4 and 5 , we compare the performance of the nine programs and the manual curation method for the phages in this study.",

Phage Commander was tested on eight high quality annotated phage genomes the majority of whose genes are experimentally verified. Results show that the optimal settings are to export genes called by at least two or at least three programs. Exporting genes called by one program resulted in few false negatives (typically 0 or 1), but a high number of false positives (typically 5 to 10). Exporting genes called by more than four programs produced an unacceptably high number of false negatives (typically 3 to 10).",
