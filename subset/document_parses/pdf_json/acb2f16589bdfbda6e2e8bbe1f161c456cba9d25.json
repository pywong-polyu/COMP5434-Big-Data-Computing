This approach is well practised where there is a sufficient evidence base available and competent interpretation of such evidence. The COVID-19 pandemic challenges this by exposing many unknowns and knowledge gaps. Initial small case series from China showed possible increased risks to cancer patients 1 and significant oncology practice changes were implemented based on this in an abundance of caution by clinicians expecting healthcare disruptions. 2,3 Subsequent emerging prospective cohorts has shown COVID-19 mortality is significantly linked with increased age and morbidities but on multivariate analyses not able to conclusively link COVID-19 to increased mortality while on anti-cancer treatments due to short follow up data. 4, 5 All practitioners must recognise uncertainties in making treatment decisions with cancer patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. 6 The key questions are (1) what is the risk of contracting COVID-19 while having treatment and (2) what is the risk of mortality of cancer patients on treatment and contracting COVID-19. 3 Radiation oncologists should now routinely discuss the concept of morbidity and mortality with patients. Early discussions of the aims of treatments, risk of severe morbidities (however small) and risk of mortality (small but ever present) is mandatory before considering treatments. The uncertainties of COVID-19 will shift the equipoise in treatment decisions towards more caution and avoidance of over-treatment. Close discussion with patients is essential if interventions offer minimal benefits in the adjuvant and palliative settings.",
