Two authors then individually read five manga each to qualitatively analyze: 6) events that triggered self-injury; 7) degree of suicidal intent (e.g., overt, implied, none); 8) consequences of self-injury; and 9) perceived functions of self-injury. In this process, perceived functions of self-injury were determined in accordance with the antecedents and consequences implicitly and explicitly portrayed in narratives. As manga contains a complex system of symbolic meaning combining multiple visual and textual subcodes, the authors paid close attention not only to plots, characters' facial expressions and dialogues but also backgrounds (e.g., tones of the scene), onomatopoeia, frames, and characters' interior monologues implying particular meanings associated with each self-injurious act.

While a similar finding was reported in a previous study in which self-injuring characters receive informal support from friends and family (Trewavas, Hasking, and McAllister 2010) , in the present study the sources of support are primarily romantic partners and close friends; reaction by families, parents in particular, to the self-injuring characters tend to be unsupportive and aversive, or even triggering, like the mother in Mondai no nai watashitachi (Kimura and Ushida 2001-2003) who desires to use her daughter to compensate for her unhappy life. In such a context, character's self-injury is portrayed as a form of resistance against repressive parental domination, similar to Bareiss's (2017) analysis of films featuring self-injuring girls. In addition, the absence of parental support for self-injury can also be explained by the prevalence of a bildungsroman theme in both sh\u014dnen and sh\u014djo manga, in which conflict with parental figures often serve as a catalyst for self-actualization for young characters.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 563, "end": 603, "text": "(Trewavas, Hasking, and McAllister 2010)", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 882, "end": 893, "text": "(Kimura and", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 894, "end": 911, "text": "Ushida 2001-2003)", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 1111, "end": 1127, "text": "Bareiss's (2017)", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "In a related vein, we observed two contrasting perspectives toward young girls who selfinjure.

As sh\u014djo manga serve young female readers as \"a model for reality\" (Masuda 2015) , these manga may invite readers to walk through life struggles with the protagonists and frame self-injury as a maladaptive but understandable response to contemporary pressures placed upon young girls.

Of particular interest is the emergence of \"menhera\" characters in two seinen manga published since 2012, in which male protagonists are attracted to menhera girls who exhibited mental instability, fear of abandonment and insecure romantic attachments. For these menhera girls, self-injury is not just an act of affect regulation but also an identity label that shapes their role in the narrative. The menhera character can be seen as a twisted variant of the damsel in distress, a classic narrative trope in literature that involves young, attractive, and helpless mistresses waiting to be rescued by a hero. They were placed in a predicament not by a monster or a villain but by mental illness that makes them prone to risky behaviour such as self-injury or sexual promiscuity. Contrary to characters that self-injure in sh\u014djo manga, these menhera girls are clearly subjected to the male gaze that objectifies and fetishizes the female self-injured body, while attention is deflected from underlying causes of self-injury. Although it may be too na\u00efve to believe that readers take such a portrayal at face value, this fetishized gaze toward menhera girls nonetheless provides its overwhelmingly male readers with a highly gendered interpretive repertoire.

Exploring subculturally sanctioned body mutilations in sh\u014dnen, seinen and seijin manga targeting male readership may imply how these self-injuries have distinctive meaning in Japanese popular culture in contrast to the pathologized and highly gendered portrayal of self-injury explored in this study. In this process, applying a critical gender lens to these representations would substantially enrich future investigation. Moreover, future exploration into self-published doujinshi (indie comics) and web comics with self-injuring characters would further expand this field of inquiry. With the advancement of indie comic markets and self-publishing online tools, Japanese readers are increasingly exposed to less filtered and more direct depictions of violence and human suffering including self-injury, suicide, and other mental health issues.

First, manga has been deeply embedded in contemporary Japanese society to the extent that its power to shape public understanding of mental health issues cannot be underestimated. Manga representations of self-injury examined in this study offer a complex commentary on self-injury and have likely influenced, to varying degrees, readers' perceptions of how people who self-injure could be like and should be treated. As manga is considered providing young readers \"textbooks for living\" (Masuda 2015, 28) , some readers may turn to these manga to make sense of their own engagement in self-injury. The portrayal of emotional support from partners and close friends observed in this study may induce a sense of hope among readers who self-injure, while reducing the feeling of social isolation commonly reported by youth engaging in self-injury (Whitlock et al. 2013) .

Indeed, remarkably little has been written about the positive therapeutic potential of manga for readers with mental health issues.

Although NSSI did not become a standalone, formal diagnosis, the term is now widely used among the clinical community allowing clinicians to treat self-injury as a mental illness. Critical scholars of health such as Amy Chandler (2014) voiced concern over how this trend towards pathologization would impact individual and public understandings of self-injury. 2 Although the history of Japanese manga can date back to the seventh century (Ito 2005) , in this article manga refers to modern Japanese graphic novels popularized after World War II that combines traditional Japanese iconography with American cartoon and cinematic techniques. Fredrik Schodt's seminal book Manga! Manga!: The World of Japanese Comics (1986) provides a comprehensive overview of the history of Japanese manga until the 1980s. Kinko Ito's chapter (2005) also provides a succinct summary of Japanese manga history from ancient times to the early twenty-first century. It is worth noting here that this article uses the term \"manga\" both as a singular and a plural noun. 3 A 2018 report by the All Japan Magazine and Book Publishers and Editors Association (AJPEA)'s 2018 estimated the total sales of the manga industry in 2017 (physical and digital platforms combined) as 433 billion yen (equivalent to $3.92 billion USD), which generated nearly double the revenues of the local film industry (228 billion yen, Motion Picture Producers Association of Japan, 2018). Although sales of print manga have been declining since the mid-1990s, the rise of denshi comic (digital comics) kept the market afloat. Manga also plays a vital role in Japan's \"media mix,\" a character-based marketing strategy to distribute content across multiple media platforms (Ito 2010) . Popular manga series often provide characters and plots for other platforms such as anime (animation), games, films, TV dramas, advertising and even political campaigns that together establish manga's pervasive presence in Japanese cultural landscape. 4 There are two potential explanations that may account for the absence of sh\u014dnen manga. First, in sh\u014dnen manga, slice-of-life genre is popular, but not as dominant as in other genre (e.g., sh\u014djo manga). Self-injury depicted as happening in imaginary worlds did not meet this study's inclusion criteria. Second, when sh\u014dnen manga portray self-injurious behaviours, the acts tend to take a form of physical aggression against objects, rather than aggression against oneself. For example, it is a common scene among sh\u014dnen and seinen manga wherein a male protagonist punches a wall or window, damages the object, and consequently hurts himself. Such a portrayal did not meet the study definition of self-injury being a deliberate hurting of one's body, because the injury is the consequence, rather than the purpose of the act. As pointed out by one reviewer, the absence of sh\u014dnen manga in our sample may also suggest a gendered understanding of self-injury penetrating Japanese popular culture. Future research focusing on gender difference in the depiction of aggressive behaviours among Japanese manga would provide further insight. 5 The term \"menhera\" spawned from a mental health discussion board on 2-channel (2-chan), a Japanese massive anonymous online forum. Although the term was originally used by people struggling mental health issues to address themselves, it increasingly carries negative, derogatory connotations in Japanese popular culture. 6 In Japan, potential psychological and behavioural impacts of manga on readers, especially adolescents and young adults, have long been the topic of contested debate. Violent and sexually explicit expressions in manga for young readership came under recurrent critique by parent associations, school authorities, and policy makers who insisted manga has harmful impact on children. Most recently in 2010, the Tokyo Metropolitan Government tried to ban the sexually explicit expression in manga and anime through the revision of the Tokyo Metropolitan Youth Healthy Development Ordinance. The Ordinance was amended to extend the definition of \"harmful content\" to include \"hijitsuzai seish\u014dnen\" (non-existent youth). Facing massive protest from writers and publishers, this proposal removed 'non-existent youth' and received approval by the Metropolitan Assembly in December 2010 (Asahi Shimbun 2010) ", "cite_spans": [{"start": 684, "end": 694, "text": "(Ito 2005)", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 1057, "end": 1077, "text": "Ito's chapter (2005)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1970, "end": 1980, "text": "(Ito 2010)", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 4580, "end": 4593, "text": "Shimbun 2010)", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}], "bib_entries": {"BIBREF0": {"ref_id": "b0", "title": "All Japan Magazine and Book Publishers and Editors Association (AJPEA)", "authors": [], "year": 2018, "venue": "Shuppan Gepp\u014d Ichigatsu G\u014d (Publisher's Monthly Report", "volume": "", "issn": "", "pages": "", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF1": {"ref_id": "b1", "title": "Last Menhera.
