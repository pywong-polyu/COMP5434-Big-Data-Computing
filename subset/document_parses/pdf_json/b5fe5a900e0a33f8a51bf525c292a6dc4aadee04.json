Based on these observed trends, we hypothesize that biological aging, above and beyond chronological age, is a robust determinant of symptom severity following COVID-19 infection. We aimed to assess the risk and predictive performance of accelerated aging for COVID-19 severe infection using a biological age measure, named phenotypic age (PhenoAge). PhenoAge was previously trained using 42 biomarkers as inputs into a supervised machine learning model to predict all-cause mortality 12, 15 . We applied this measure to biomarker data from 2006 to 2010 of participants from a large community cohort, United Kingdom Biobank (UKB) 16, 17 . Combined with information on disease diagnoses updated to March 2020, we tested whether accelerated aging was predictive of COVID-19 severity based on mortality data and COVID-19 test results linked from the UK National Health Service (NHS) 18 .",

This is in-line with the geroscience framework and further supported by our previous work showing that people with younger biological ages are less prone to a plethora of diverse age-related diseases 25 . By intervening to slow aging, therapeutics may in turn reduce pathological burden as well as minimize the risks of diseases like COVID-19, which are exacerbated by aging and pathology. To date, a number of aging therapeutics are being considered, which target key pathways and hallmarks of aging-reducing insulin/IGF-1 signaling (rapamycin), removing senescent cells (senolytics), and/or improving insulin sensitivity (metformin). Increasing autophagy and reducing age-related inflammation are also emerging as key mechanisms targeted by these drugs 26 .

We used two COVID-19 severity outcomes: inpatient test positivity between March 16 and April 27, 2020, and COVID-19 related mortality (death certificate ICD code: U071 or U072) with inpatient test-confirmed COVID-19 between March 16 and April 27, 2020. To ensure that test positivity is a proxy for COVID-19 severity, we restricted positives to inpatient positives between March 16 and April 27, 2020, when only symptomatic individuals were tested 19 . As of April 27, 2020, hospitals under the UK NHS direction have tested all non-elective patients admitted overnight, including asymptomatic patients 19 . The death data including causes up to October, 2020, was used to determine death status for inpatient positives between March 16 and April 27, 2020. For the test positivity outcome, we compared inpatient test positives between March 16 and April 27 to untested samples and samples tested negative, excluding positive cases at non-inpatient settings between March 16 and April 27, and positive cases regardless of origins from April 27 to December 21, 2020, as the severity of these people are uncertain. We included untested samples as they were enriched for milder or asymptomatic COVID-19 responses. For the mortality outcome, we compared COVID-19 related deaths with inpatient test confirmed COVID-19 between March 16 and April 27, 2020 to untested samples, samples tested negative, and inpatient positives (March 16 to April 27, 2020) who survived, excluding those as for inpatient test positivity and deaths unrelated to COVID-19, based on ICD codes on death certificates.",

Similarly, participants with self-reported black ethnicity were more likely to test positive at an inpatient setting than those with self-reported white ethnicity, regardless of models (Tables 2-4). Increased age at the pandemic was associated with increased risks of inpatient test positivity and COVID-19 related mortality but age at the pandemic was not associated with inpatient test positivity (p>0.05) after adjusting for concurrent disease prevalence (M5 and M6).Independent of age at the pandemic and other demographics, increased PhenoAge was associated with an increased risk of inpatient test positivity (OR=1.37 per 5 years, 95% CI: 1.27-1.47, p=1.1\uf0b410 -17 ) and COVID-19 related mortality (OR=1.63 per 5 years, 95% CI: 1.43-1.86, p=4.7\uf0b410 -13 ) (Table 2 M2). The associations above were modestly reduced with additional adjustment for prevalent diseases at baseline (inpatient test positivity: OR=1.25 per 5 years, 95% CI: 1.16-1.35, p=6.1\uf0b410 -9 and COVID-19 related mortality: OR=1.50 per 5 years, 95% CI: 1.30-1.73, p=3.1\uf0b410 -8 ) (Table 3 M4). At baseline, there were no participants diagnosed with dementia or having history of delirium. The association with type II diabetes was significantly reduced for inpatient test positivity (M3: OR=2.0 to M4: OR=1.59) but remained statistically significant (p<0.05) when adjusting for differences in PhenoAgeAccel(Table 3M3 to M4). We investigated if the association attenuation with type II diabetes can be explained by specific PhenoAge biomarkers, known to be associated with type II diabetes, particularly glucose, creatinine, and CRP (log-transformed). PhenoAgeAccel in M4 was adjusted for chronological age and one of the biomarkers additionally and the change in OR associated with type II diabetes from M3 to M4 was compared to that with PhenoAgeAccel adjusted for chronological age only. The association attenuation with type II diabetes is attributed to a biomarker if the association attenuation with type II diabetes was significantly reduced when PhenoAgeAccel is further adjusted for that biomarker before entering M4. We expected the biomarkers contributed to the attenuation differently depending on the shared association between type II diabetes and PhenoAge determined by the biomarker. We found that the association function of multiple biomarkers cannot be replaced by any single biomarker in PhenoAge for associations with COVID-19 severity. Of note, the disease associations from M3 and M4 could be biased by those who developed diseases after baseline so the results are not as reliable as those from M5 and M6, e.g., negative associations between asthma and COVID-19 related mortality from M3",
