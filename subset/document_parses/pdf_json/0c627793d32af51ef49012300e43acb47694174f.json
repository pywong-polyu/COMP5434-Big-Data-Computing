There are similar disparities in access to endovascular therapy (EVT). For example, Black and Native American patients had significantly lower rates of EVT than White, Hispanic, and Asian/Pacific Islander patients, 7 while in a large GWTG (Get With The Guidelines) study published in 2015, Black patients had lower odds of receiving EVT (odds ratio [OR], 0.70; 95% CI, 0.66-0.75) compared with Non-Hispanic White (NHW) patients. 8 Given the publication in 2015 of several randomized controlled clinical trials as well as meta-analyses showing benefit of EVT, we used the GWTG database to examine if clinical practices had changed the Sheriff et al Disparities in EVT According to Race and Ethnicity magnitude of race and ethnicity differences in the rates of mechanical thrombectomy during the pre-and postpublication eras. The comprehensive GWTG database is uniquely suited to analyze factors related to the potential racial and ethnic disparities in the rates of EVT, and to further explore whether such factors contribute to differences in clinical outcome.",

            "text": "In this large cohort of \"real world\" patients eligible for EVT from the GWTG registry, we demonstrate that despite overall increase in EVT use across all racial and ethnic groups and narrowing of the disparity gap especially in the era post-2015, there continues to be significant racial and ethnic differences in the use of this therapy. Non-Hispanic Black patients had a significantly lower likelihood of receiving EVT compared with NHW ones. In addition, although some short-term outcomes were better in under-represented racial and ethnic groups, they did worse compared with NHW patients in regards to long-term outcomes. Various factors have been proposed for disparities in EVT use including a lack of awareness of stroke signs and symptoms, 18 lack of knowledge on need for urgent care among under-represented racial and ethnic groups with delays in arriving to emergency rooms, lower socioeconomic status, and lack of insurance coverage. The higher incidence of intracranial atherosclerosis among Black, Asian, and Hispanic individuals compared with NHW ones needs to be considered in the lower rates of EVT in these populations despite comparable arrival times. 19 Conversely, the concept of allostatic load burden as a contributor to higher incidence of chronic disease and worse outcomes among under-represented racial and ethnic groups should not be ignored by the medical community. 20 There is also mistrust of the health care system likely because of historic inequalities and injustices exacerbated by fewer health care providers from under-represented race and ethnic groups. 21 The presence of bias, whether on a provider or system-wide level in the health care delivery system is the most difficult to evaluate for and systemic racism has become an increasingly identified problem of public health significance in more recent years 22, 23 ; this is also reflected in unequal participation in clinical trials including stroke research of under-represented race and ethnic groups. 2 Importantly, our study demonstrated that these inter-racial differences have narrowed over time comparing the era pre-and post-publication (in 2015). This improvement may in part reflect the effects of prior multiethnic educational campaigns (particularly from a young age) 24, 25 and improved awareness among the society including health care providers post publication of positive stroke trials. It is important to note that despite an overall sharp increase in use of EVT after January 2015 as demonstrated in a large GWTG study, there is also a persistent geographic variation. 15 Multiple previous observational studies have documented the presence of disparities in stroke incidence, care, and outcomes according to racial and ethnic groups beginning with the NOMAS (Northern Manhattan Study). 1, 19 A study of a large cohort of patients admitted to GWTG hospitals between 2003 and 2008 documented a differential quality of care postacute ischemic stroke among Black patients compared with Hispanic and NHW patients in regards to implementation of evidence-based treatments. 5 There are few studies looking at EVT and differences according to race andethnicity. 7, 8, 26 In a large nationwide database for admissions for acute ischemic stroke to endovascular centers, the overall use of EVT was reported to be 8.4% which is lower than the 14% documented in our cohort. They did find lower use of EVT in Black and Hispanic patients. Another GWTG study also demonstrated a higher rate of transfer of NHW patients compared with under-represented racial and ethnic groups to EVT capable centers. 27 In our cohort, under-represented racial and ethnic groups compared with NHW had certain better shortterm outcomes including a lower in-hospital mortality/ discharge to hospice and higher discharge to home however with no significant difference in good functional outcomes (mRS 0-2) and independent ambulation at discharge. These results corroborate similar findings in recent studies showing lower in-hospital mortality and higher discharge to home among Black and Hispanic patients and are in contrast with earlier studies which demonstrated higher in-hospital mortality among under-represented racial and ethnic groups. 5, [28] [29] [30] [31] The differences in end of life decisions may be, in part, explained by different attitudes towards end of life care among NHW patients compared with under-represented racial and ethnic groups, with the former more likely to opt for Do Not Resuscitate status, withdrawal of care, and hospice. 32, 33 Availability of palliative care services also tends to be better in hospitals serving NHW majorities. 34 Notably, our study did demonstrate a lower likelihood of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage in Black patients which was statistically significant after 2015 compared with NHW but did not achieve significance in the overall adjusted analysis.",

First, certain racial and ethnic groups were not individually reported such as people of Native American, Alaskan, and other under-represented race and ethnic heritage groups-these groups were classified as \"other.\" Second, participation in GWTG database is voluntary and the design of our study is observational. Third, EVT eligibility was determined clinically (NIHSS \u22656 and LSW<6 hours) and no CT angiography or angiographic confirmation was available. The incidence of LVO in patients presenting with NIHSS \u22656 presenting under 6 hours may differ according to race andethnicity as evidenced in a UK-based study. 38 While the lack of angiographic confirmation is an important limitation, these findings have not been consistently replicated across other larger studies some of which have demonstrated all ischemic stroke subtypes are more prevalent in Black patients compared with NHW patients. 39 Fourth, the statistical approach of using all covariates without tests of significance in univariate testing may lead the study to underestimate the true size of the disparities as experienced from a patient perspective. Our study has significant strengths. First and foremost is the large sample size which provides sufficient number of patients for most ethnic underrepresented racial and ethnic groups allowing meaningful associations and inferences. Of note, there was no significant racial difference in 90-day mRS missingness across racial and ethnic groups; P=0.44. In addition, the overall representative cohort provides high Sheriff et al Disparities in EVT According to Race and Ethnicity quality granular data enabling a proper understanding of the \"real world\" situation in US hospitals in regard to EVT use and subsequent outcomes. 12 ",

These differences have narrowed over time. Despite slightly better short-term outcomes among under-represented racial and ethnic groups including Black, Hispanic, and Asian compared with NHW patients, these improvements were not sustained at 3 months. Intensification of preexistingefforts to eradicate systemic racism and convert \"observations (of racial and ethnic disparities) to actions\" are necessary in uniformly increasing access to life-saving therapies such as EVT and subsequent outcomes among all racial and ethnic groups. 23, 40 ",
