A 2020 survey of Brazilian MSM and transgender/non-binary individuals conducted via geosocial networking applications (GSN apps) and social media found 19.8% of respondents reported current PrEP use, though this percentage did not consider PrEP eligibility of respondents and is likely an over-estimate of PrEP use given recruitment from groups affiliated with ImPrEP. 13 Low levels of PrEP utilization in Brazil compared to the goal of 50% coverage 4 suggest a need for further exploration of facilitators and barriers to use among those who are eligible for PrEP.",

According to the SUS website, two-thirds of the country's 270 facilities providing PrEP are located in the south or southeast region of the country. The state of S\u00e3o Paulo, for example, accounts for 100 of these facilities, while eight states in the north and northeast regions of the country have two or fewer facilities listed. 9 Even individuals with access to a facility may encounter an overburdened system, as indicated by free-text responses about long wait times. The Federal Nursing Council in Brazil recently approved nurses to be able to prescribe PrEP in an effort to increase the number of PrEP providers in the country. 30 While our survey provides some insights into these structural barriers to PrEP access, future research on PrEP use in Brazil should explore this important topic in more depth.",

Despite higher levels of HIV knowledge among PrEP users, 10% of those currently taking PrEP incorrectly responded 'false' to the HIV-KA item 'there are medications for HIVnegative people to take to prevent HIV.' This result is surprising for a group of MSM reportedly taking PrEP. Though the exact reason for these incorrect responses is unclear, this finding indicates a need for improved counselling about the protection offered by taking PrEP, as misunderstandings could have implications for adherence.",

A recent study of PrEP awareness among GSN app users in Mexico found that the majority reported first learning about PrEP via the internet, rather than from a doctor, 27 which emphasizes the importance of providing accurate, easyto-find information about PrEP and HIV prevention online and suggests that internet-based advertising may be a promising channel for information dissemination.

The reason for the inverse association between internalized homonegativity and PrEP use in Brazil is likely multifactorial, and further research, perhaps via a qualitative study, should explore this relationship in more depth. One study found that discrimination may decrease willingness to access HIV prevention services, 32 though only 2.7% of respondents in our study listed discrimination as the main reason for never taking or having stopped PrEP. Another study of MSM in Brazil, Mexico, and Peru found concern about talking to healthcare providers about sex life and worry that taking PrEP may lead others to assume one has HIV as barriers to PrEP use. 16 While our survey did not include those particular response options, several respondents provided a free text response indicating that they had never used PrEP because of shame or fear of others finding out. Lastly, while Brazil has been a leader in HIV prevention in Latin America, societal stigma continues to limit public health efforts to reach particular sexual and gender minority groups and the current far-right government has limited certain human rights protections that are crucial for HIV prevention efforts, 33,34 both of which could be related to the relationship between internalized homonegativity and PrEP use.",

Not surprisingly, all three of these PrEP eligibility criteria were associated with increased odds of current PrEP use. An increasing number of male sexual partners was also found to be associated with increased odds of PrEP use, and MSM reporting 31 or more partners in the past six months had the highest prevalence of current PrEP use among any subgroup. Those reporting recent chemsex or daily use of GSN apps to procure sex had higher levels of current PrEP use, but the strength of these associations decreased or was lost when other demographic and sexual behavior variables were adjusted for in the full model. A similar trend was noted in a prior work exploring associations with the willingness to use PrEP. 16 Our study has several limitations. As a cross-sectional survey, conclusions cannot be made regarding the causality of identified associations with current PrEP use. Additionally, all responses were self-reported, thus introducing the possibility of recall, response, or social desirability bias. Selection bias due to a survey completion percentage of 67% and the demographic characteristics of respondents may have led to an overestimation of the true prevalence of PrEP use among MSM in the country. Three-quarters of our sample were from either S\u00e3o Paulo or Rio de Janeiro and, given previously reported heterogeneity among Brazilian MSM 26 and greater access to PrEP services in the southeast region of the country, 9 this limits the generalizability of our results. Moreover, this sample represents a highly educated, high socioeconomic status subset of Brazilian MSM with access to a device compatible with GSN apps, although cellphones and internet connection have been shown to be widely available in all socioeconomic strata in Brazil. The question used to create our outcome of current PrEP use did not include any time-frame to guide respondents as to what \"currently taking PrEP\" meant, though adherence data presented in Table 1 suggest most had taken PrEP four or more times in the past week. Only those identifying as gay or homosexual were included in our analysis of internalized homonegativity, which may have skewed the results by failing to capture the impact of internalized homonegativity on PrEP use for MSM who indicated other sexual orientations. Lastly, our PrEP-eligible inclusion criteria did not consider recent PEP use, which is an additional eligibility criteria in Brazil.",

While PrEP use has increased among Brazilian MSM in recent years, current use remains well below the 50% coverage recommended by UNAIDS, reinforcing the need to identify barriers and facilitators to PrEP uptake. Greater HIV knowledge and lower internalized homonegativity were associated with increased odds of current PrEP use. Wider dissemination of HIV prevention knowledge and addressing stigma experienced by MSM when engaging with healthcare services could promote increased PrEP use.",

This study offers important insights into previously unexplored barriers and facilitators to PrEP use in Brazil, and is unique in its focus on MSM who are eligible for and living in a country with national access to PrEP.
