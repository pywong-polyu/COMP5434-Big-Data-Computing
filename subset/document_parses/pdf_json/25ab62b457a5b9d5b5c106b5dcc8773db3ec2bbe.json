However, the value of corticoids in the treatment of COVID-19 has been widely debated with conflicting results [9] [10] [11] . Several trials have revealed that COVID-19 patients treated with corticosteroids had lower all-cause mortality than those not treated with corticosteroids [12, 13] . Meanwhile, other randomized controlled trials (RCTs) showed no significant difference in allcause mortality between COVID-19 patients treated with corticosteroids and those not treated with corticosteroids [10, 14] . Previous meta-analyses mainly focused on the association between corticosteroids and COVID-19, and few of them explored the dose, the type of corticosteroids, and the disease severity of patients. In addition, most of the studies included in previous meta-analyses were retrospective or observational studies, or fewer RCTs, which provide low evidence grades to draw a scientific conclusion on the systemic use of corticosteroids in COVID-19 patients [15] . Our meta-analysis, which included more RCTs, aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy in severe COVID-19 patients to provide a high level of evidence for clinical decisionmaking in treating severe COVID-19 patients.",

Finally, 10 articles were included ( Figure 1 ) [10, 11, 14, [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] .",

A total of 1135 of 4354 patients died in the corticosteroid treatment group, and 2153 of 8119 patients died in the usual care or placebo group, which showed that corticosteroid did not significantly reduce the risk of death (RR: 0.93; CI: 0.82, 1.05; P = 0.26; I 2 = 52%, Figure 3 ). To address the heterogeneity, we conducted subgroup analyses. No reduction in mortality also was observed in the subgroup of patients who required mechanical ventilation (355 of 815 [43.6%] in the corticosteroids group vs. 657 of 1441 [45.6%] in the control group, RR: 0.90; CI: 0.79-1.03; P = 0.13, I 2 = 56%, Figure 4 ). However, the use of corticosteroids increased mortality in the subgroup of patients who do not require oxygen support, with results confirmed at sensitivity analyses (RR: 1.24; 95% CI: 1.00-1.55; P = 0.05; I 2 = 0%, Figure 4 ). The benefit was observed in a low dosage of corticosteroids (RR: 0.90; 95% CI: 0.84-0.97; P = 0.007; I 2 = 0%, Figure 5 ). Patients treated with dexamethasone had a significantly lower risk of mortality(RR: 0.90; 95% CI: 0.79-1.04; P = 0.14; I 2 = 0%, Figure 5 ). No difference in mortality was found in the subgroups of hydrocortisone and methylprednisolone.

However, the subgroup analysis found the survival benefit was observed in both patients treated with a low dosage of corticosteroids and patients treated with dexamethasone. No increased risk of the need for mechanical ventilation, adverse events, or secondary infections were found. However, due to the great heterogeneity between trials, clear conclusions remain a challenge. COVID-19 is an emerging infectious disease, and there is currently no optimal treatment [8] . Based on its in vitro SARS-CoV-2 antiviral activity and data from observational researches that effectively reduce viral load, corticosteroids have been widely used in severe COVID-19 patients [24] , Whether the efficacy of this strategy has been controversial. Several metaanalysis studies have evaluated the efficacy of corticosteroids in COVID-19 patients with inconsistent results. In a metaanalysis based on retrospective studies, Pei et al. [25] reported that corticosteroids treatment might increase the risk of death (OR: 2.43; 95% CI: 1.44-4.1; P = 0.0001). Another meta-analysis of cohort studies shared a similar conclusion that corticosteroids were ineffective in reducing mortality, shortening the duration of symptoms, or virus clearance time [26] . However, both of these meta-analyses include non-RCTs, which may be biased and reduce the quality of conclusions. Conversely, Some recent meta-analyses of RCTs showed a mortality benefit in severe COVID-19 patients treated with corticosteroids [27, 28] . Our meta-analysis included more RCTs and reached the different conclusions that 1135 (26.2%) patients died in the corticosteroid treatment group, 2153 (26.5%) patients died in the usual care or placebo group, corticosteroids did not significantly reduce the risk of death. But due to the different inclusion criteria, type of corticosteroid, dosage, this conclusion had great heterogeneity.",

[29] found a reduction in mortality was observed in the subgroup of patients who required mechanical ventilation. It was recommended that severe patients could consider corticosteroids therapy. In our meta-analysis, the survival benefit of corticosteroid therapy was not observed in the subgroup of patients requiring mechanical ventilation. Evidence was mainly obtained from 5 trials, of which four trials showed no survival benefit [14, 20, 22, 24] . One trial indicated that the use of dexamethasone reduced the 28day mortality among those receiving either mechanical ventilation or oxygen alone [11] . Remarkably, our study found patients who have not received oxygen had a trend toward increased mortality when using corticosteroids. Jeronimo et al. [14] proposed a possible explanation that early use of corticosteroids in COVID-19 patients could lead to an increase in viral load, which needs to be confirmed by further studies. Therefore, caution is needed in the use of corticosteroids in mild subjects not receiving oxygen therapy. In addition, Patients over 60 years old receiving corticosteroids therapy had a lower mortality rate, while patients under 60 years old had a higher mortality rate [14] . However, Corral-Gudino et al. [21] found no evidence of interaction between treatment and patient age; corticosteroids have similar beneficial effects in the treatment of young and old patients.",

In our study, the main types of corticosteroids were hydrocortisone, dexamethasone, and methylprednisolone. No difference in mortality was found in the subgroups of hydrocortisone and methylprednisolone. A retrospective quasi-experimental study showed that dexamethasone is more effective in improving the PO2/FiO2 ratio of COVID-19 patients than methylprednisolone [32] . Another study also provided evidence that dexamethasone and betamethasone are effective for COVID-19 treatment because of their potential to inhibit the proteolytic activity of Mpro (a cysteine protease that plays a vital role in polyprotein processing and virus maturation) by comparing molecular docking studies of six corticosteroids (cortisone, hydrocortisone, prednisolone, methylprednisolone, betamethasone, and dexamethasone) and two repurposed drugs (darunavir and lopinavir) [33] [34] [35] [36] . However, these survival benefits depended largely on the RECOVERY trial [11] , which consisted of approximately 83.5% and 94.8%of the total number of patients in the analysis. if the RECOVERY trial excluded [11] , these survival benefits were absent, more RCTs are needed in the future to draw definite conclusions.",

Corticosteroid therapy attenuates the immune response, which increased the chance of infection and other adverse events [37] . In our study, seven studies reported the incidence rate of adverse events in COVID-19 patients (corticosteroid:7.0% vs control:5.9%) [10, [18] [19] [20] [21] 23, 24] . Four studies reported the incidence rate of nosocomial infections (corticosteroid:22.8% vs control:26.7%) [10, [19] [20] [21] . There was no difference in the rates of adverse events and nosocomial infections between the corticosteroids group and the control group. One of 7 studies (GLUCOCOVID) showed that hyperglycemia (>180 mg/dl) was more frequent in the corticosteroid group in the ICU, with a significant difference [21] . Tomazini et al. [20] also reported unspecified hyperglycemia. Except for hyperglycemia, the incidence of adverse events was similar in either group. Similarly, a systematic review including peer-reviewed studies of any design reported that hyperglycemia was the most common adverse effect [38] . Therefore, when corticosteroids are used in clinical treatment, we need to pay more attention to blood sugar levels.",

Second, the presence of confounding variables (age, severity of disease, corticosteroids type, dosage, treatment duration, and so on) led to significant clinical heterogeneity and weakened the results of this meta-analysis. Therefore, the summary results need to be interpreted carefully. Third, the mortality rates in different periods were reported by multiple studies; 5 trials reported mortality at 28 days, 2 trials reported mortality at 21 days, 1 trial reported mortality at 14 days, and 1 trial did not mention the time of death, potentially leading to inconsistent experimental results. Fourth, Except for the RECOVERY trial and RECOVERY2 trial, most of the included studies have small sample sizes and may be biased. Small studies might have lower quality and a high risk of bias, which might contribute to the exaggerated intervention effects compared with large studies, so further exploration is needed [39, 40] .",
