Country-level data sources are identified and processed to form a homogenized panel at the NUTS 3 or NUTS 2 level, the two lowest standardized administrative units of Europe. The strengths and weaknesses of each country dataset are discussed in detail. The raw data, spatial layers, the code, and the final homogenized files are provided in an online repository for replication. The data highlights the spatial distribution of cases both within and across countries that can be utilized for a disaggregated analysis on the impacts of the pandemic. The Tracker is updated monthly to expand its coverage. 9",

            "text": "COVID-19 cases exploded in Europe around early March 2020. At the center of this spread were the regions of North 23 Italy 6 and the ski resort of Ishgl in the western part of Austria. 7 From this point onward, the virus quickly spread across the 24 European continent, resulting in a rapid increase in cases and deaths, and alarming governments that implemented stringent 25 lockdown measures including border closures, reductions in mobility, to shutting down the economy. 8 While the virus was 26 mostly contained during the summer of 2020, a resurgence in cases in the Fall of 2020 resulted in a massive second wave that 27 completely overshadowed the first wave in terms of cases and deaths. In order to contain the virus, a second round of lockdown 28 measures were put in place around October 2020. 9 Currently, in early 2021, the detection of more infectious virus variants, and 29 a slower-than-expected vaccine roll-out in Europe has prompted countries to further extend their lockdown measures. As Figure   30 1 shows, no other continent has borne the brunt of the virus as Europe which still has a major share in global cases and deaths. 31 A unique feature of the COVID-19 pandemic is the amount of knowledge and data that is constantly being generated 32 to understand how this event unfolds. For a high-income region like Europe, the quality of information that is generated 33 on a daily basis is exceptionally high for most countries. Furthermore, several innovative datasets have appeared since the 34 start of the pandemic that provide unique information. For example, the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker 10 35 and the Complexity Science Hub (CSH) Tracker 11 evaluate daily policy changes for a host of indicators for all countries of together with the extent of the errors. Regardless of the minor matching issues in the homogenized dataset, raw data is also 97 available in case the users prefer to use the original source of information. 98 Second, some countries use different types of administrative divisions for regional tracking of COVID-19 cases that do not 99 have an official correspondence to NUTS classifications. For example, Finland uses Hospital Districts, Greece uses Prefectures, 100 Norway uses Kommunes, and the UK reports at the Local Authority Districts (LADs). This issue is resolved by overlaying the 101 different administrative regions with NUTS boundaries to generate a spatial crosswalk or a region-to-NUTS mapping. For 102 Greece, Norway, and the UK the regions map perfectly to NUTS boundaries while for Finland, small errors persist in some 103 regions. These are also highlighted and discussed in the Technical Validation section. GitHub repository, https://github.com/asjadnaqvi/COVID19-European-Regional-Tracker, is updated 111 once a month to expand its temporal coverage, and fix errors and bugs if any. 112 For each country two sets of data files are provided. The first set contains the raw data files downloaded from various 113 sources. These files include the records as they exist in the original data including the information on the spatial unit at which 114 the information is released. Most countries provided data at a administrative units below NUTS 3 (see Table 1 ). Furthermore, 115 most of the raw files contain more information than in the final data set homogenized at the NUTS level which contains 116 cumulative and daily cases information, the baseline variables that exist in all country files. Additional variables in the raw data 117 for example, include deaths, recovered, tested, hospitalized, and vaccinated. Some countries also provide age and gender-wise 118 breakdowns. Therefore, users of this Tracker can go deeper with their analysis by compiling a finer resolution and more detailed 119 dataset for analysis. The second set are the processed country files that map and convert the raw data into homogenized datasets 120 at the NUTS level. This mapping is done using Stata scripts or dofiles, which also identify the region-to-NUTS mapping. If 121 Stata is not available, the dofiles can be viewed with any generic text editor. The code structure is fairly straightforward to read 122 and can be easily converted to other programming languages. The files homogenized at the NUTS level are ready for analysis 123 and can be merged with other NUTS-level datasets available on Eurostat 3 for example.",

Here we can immediately observe that larger units in terms of area have more cases 264 overall than smaller ones. If we control for population size then a different picture emerges. For example, it is clear from the 265 cumulative cases per 10,000 population map that Germany managed to insulate itself very well from neighboring countries by 266 enforcing strict border controls. Despite this, regions on the east side show a higher incidence rate than the west and north 267 Germany. Similarly the western part of Austria, north Italy, Switzerland, and eastern part of France have a much higher level 268 of cases per capita relative to the remaining regions in these countries. Sweden with its lack of strict lockdown policies also 269 stands out among the Nordic countries. Explanations for these trends are left as research questions. Furthermore, given the 270 daily resolution of the data in the Tracker, these maps can also be checked for variations in the first and the second waves. First, since the country-level datasets are official records provided by different government departments of each country, 275 they can be compared with various online dashboards highlighted in Table 2 . It is also important to point out that not all 276 countries release the latest data at the regional level. A good example of this is France, that releases a file daily but the regional 277 information is usually two to three days old. Similarly the crowd-sourced data for Switzerland, is back-filled data as information Second, as discussed earlier, regional data is approximated during the homogenization process for some countries. In order 281 to ensure transparency, Table 3 provides notes for various countries where either data is converted from ranges into unique 282 values (for example, Belgium, Estonia, and Latvia) or boundaries are approximated using a spatial merge (for example, Finland, Third, since the data is at the regional level, it can be aggregated up to generate country-level totals which can be compared 301 with data aggregator websites like the Our World in Data (OWID) COVID-19 tracker. OWID is used and referenced almost 302 daily in scientific research and the media and has a major impact of policy discussions. OWID was utilizing country-level 303 information provided by the European Center for Disease Control (ECDC) till November 2020. In November 2020, ECDC 304 announced that it only do bi-weekly data releases. As a response OWID switched to the John Hopkins University's (JHU) data 305 repository, a major data source for COVID-19 information at the global level. 1 For validation, both this Tracker and OWID data 306 is merged on a country-date combination and the difference between the country-level daily cases is calculated. Figure 7 plots 307 the difference split by countries. Figure 7 shows a how good the match is before 1 October 2020. After October 2020, the 308 mismatch for most countries increases significantly and persists till today. This highlights two points. First, before October 309 2020, data was provided by ECDC which was taking information directly from European countries. Since this Tracker is also 310 pulling data from the countries directly, the match is exceptionally close with the exception of some outliers. This exercise 311 helps validate the data of this Tracker. Second, since the data source of this Tracker remains the same, while OWID changed 312 its source to a more unverified data set around October 2020, this Tracker provides a more accurate picture of country-level 313 aggregates and also includes regional variation. 314 1 See the press release here https://ourworldindata.org/covid-data-switch-jhu.",

This 284 is a judgement call in order to allow these countries to merge with the remaining files. For Belgium and Latvia, regions with 285 cases less than five are anonymized as <5. These values have been replaced with 1. For Estonia, which only provides data 286 in ranges of 10s, mid values of each range is taken and multiplied with total cases to estimate cases per region, and then the 287 regions are aggregated to NUT 3. Therefore, the data approximation is the highest for Estonia. The raw data and the scripts are288 available in case users prefer the actual information or have other approximation strategies. For countries which do not have an 289 official correspondence to NUTS regions, a boundary approximation is done with a spatial merge by overlaying administrative 290 boundaries with NUTS boundaries. For UK, Norway and Greece, the spatial merge creates a perfect mapping as shown in For Finland, the hospital districts, that are size-wise comparable to NUTS 3 boundaries contains minor errors in some 292 cases since boundaries do not align. In an ideal case scenario, data should be provided at the smallest possible unit that can 293 be aggregated up to various administrative boundaries, as is the case with UK and Norway. The official Finish website does 294 provide COVID-19 data at municipality level, a unit below NUTS 3, but accessing the map is not straightforward nor it is clear 295 whether this data is even openly accessible. On a related note, Italy data is officially released at the NUTS 2021 definitions so 296 mapping to NUTS 2016 definitions do not work perfectly for some regions on an island off mainland Italy. These regions show 297 up as missing on the map. For both the Finnish and Italian regions that do not perfectly match, the number of cases are very 298 small for it to make a significant difference. Regardless, original administrative units and their data in the raw files and can be 299 used for more accuracy.",
