However, epizootic outbreaks in the United States causing febrile and neurological illnesses in equids and humans have occurred periodically [3] . NW alphavirus infection can progress to encephalitis with a <1% case fatality rate for VEEV, with persistence of long-term neurological sequelae in survivors [3, 4] . VEEV is classified as a category B select pathogen by the National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases [5, 6] . Currently, there are no FDA-approved vaccines or therapeutics available for the treatment of exposure to VEEV and resultant disease manifestations. The live-attenuated vaccine strain of VEEV TC-83 is administered to military and at-risk personnel only, due to high reactogenicity concerns [7] .",

Total protein lysates obtained from the transfected cells were used for immunoprecipitation (IP) using a HA antibody to enrich for nsP3-interacting host partners. Expression of nsP3 in transfected cells was confirmed by Western blot ( Figure 1A , left panel), and a Western blot using IP samples ( Figure 1A , right panel) confirmed the specificity of the HA-tag IP pulldown. HA-IP samples from both HA-nsP3 and the pcDNA empty control vector transfections (negative control) were subjected to liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Spectra from MS runs 1-2 ( Figure 1B) were fitted against the nonstructural polyprotein for the wild-type Trinidad donkey (TrD) strain. Spectra from MS runs 3-7 were fitted against the specific amino acids for nsP3 of the VEEV nonstructural polyprotein precursor ( Figure 1B ). Figure 1B displays the percentage of nsP3 protein covered by the number of peptides detected as well as the protein score (Score A SEQUEST HT), as measured by the individual scores of the peptides for a marker of protein identification. Total protein hits for the 7 MS runs were further evaluated to obtain interactors and inhibitors of interest ( Figure 1C ). Briefly, MS data were processed to remove host interactors identified in the HA-pcDNA IP from the HA-nsP3 IP samples in order to eliminate background hits and obtain host proteins that specifically interact with VEEV nsP3. These putative host interactors were evaluated using Ingenuity Pathways Analysis (IPA) to obtain a list of host proteins detected across multiple MS runs as well as inhibitors targeting the activity of these proteins. MS runs 1-4 were analyzed together and host proteins present in at least 2 of 4 runs were selected. Similarly, MS runs 5-7 were analyzed together and host proteins present in at least 2 of 3 runs were selected. The two sets of MS runs were analyzed independently in order to expand detection of potential host proteins that may be interacting with VEEV nsP3. In total, 160 putative host interactors with VEEV nsP3 (Supplementary Table S1 ) were identified along with 42 inhibitors targeting these host proteins as identified by IPA (Supplementary Table S2 ). The inhibitors prioritized by IPA were further analyzed in the context of published literature and the inhibitor list was narrowed to nine candidates for in vitro analyses of inhibitory potential ( Figure 1D ). These inhibitors were selected based on previous efficacy studies with related alphaviruses or other positive-sense RNA viruses, or if their predicted host target suggested a proviral role for replication. 7 MS runs were further evaluated to obtain interactors and inhibitors of interest ( Figure  1C ).

Citalopram HBr is FDAapproved, exhibiting nanomolar potency while inhibiting apoptotic activity in vitro [44, 45] . Z-VEID-FMK is a well-documented caspase-6 inhibitor demonstrating inhibition of fasinduced apoptosis at nanomolar concentrations [46, 47] . Cell viability was measured for each inhibitor at 24 h post-treatment ( Figure 4A ). Tomatidine displayed a CC 50 value of 175 \u00b5M while citalopram HBr and Z-VEID-FMK were nontoxic at most concentrations tested. To determine IC 50 values, U-87MG cells were pretreated for 2 h, infected with TC-83 virus, and viral supernatants were evaluated by plaque assay at 24 hpi ( Figure 4B ). In addition, 50% inhibition of TC-83 replication was observed at 2.5 \u00b5M for tomatidine, 1 \u00b5M for citalopram HBr, and 0.5 \u00b5M for Z-VEID-FMK ( Figure 4C ). The resulting SI value for tomatidine was calculated as 70.

            "text": "To determine the steps of the VEEV replication cycle affected by tomatidine, citalopram HBr, or Z-VEID-FMK treatment, viral replication kinetics and levels of positive and negative-sense viral RNA strands in infected cells were quantified following pre-treatment or post-treatment with these inhibitors. First, the replication levels of TC-83 in U-87MG cells were measured at 6, 12, and 24 hpi after a 2-h pretreatment with each drug and subsequent infection at MOI 0.1 ( Figure 5A ). At each time point post-infection, viral supernatants were evaluated for infectious titers by plaque assay ( Figure 5B ) and intracellular lysates were obtained to quantify the positive-and negative-RNA strands by qRT-PCR and semi-quantitative RT-PCR, respectively ( Figure 5C ). At all time points, infectious particle production was inhibited for all three inhibitors tested ( Figure 5B ). Tomatidine reduced plaque formation as time points post-infection increased with a 55-fold, 9-fold, and 21-fold reduction observed at 6, 12, and 24 hpi, respectively, as compared to the DMSO control ( Figure 5B ). However, a more consistent and progressive inhibition of intracellular positivesense RNA synthesis was observed at 10-fold, 45-fold, and 124-fold for 6, 12, and 24 hpi, respectively ( Figure 5C ). Citalopram HBr reduced plaque production by 72-fold, 54-fold, and 176-fold at 6, 12, and 24 hpi, respectively, as compared to the DMSO control ( Figure 5B ). The reduction in positive-sense RNA synthesis was inhibited variably upon citalopram HBr treatment, by 21-fold,~10,000-fold, and 1000-fold at 6, 12, 24 hpi, respectively ( Figure 2C ). Z-VEID-FMK reduced plaque production as time points post-infection increased with a 44-fold, 53-fold, and 74-fold inhibition observed at 6, 12, 24 hpi, respectively, as compared to the DMSO control ( Figure 5B) , whereas, positive-sense RNA was reduced at 6, 12, and 24 hpi by 39-fold, 606-fold, and 110-fold, respectively, as compared to the DMSO control ( Figure 5C ). Collectively, citalopram HBr and Z-VEID-FMK reduce TC-83 plaque and positive-sense RNA production across all time points post-infection ( Figure 5B )., In contrast to the large inhibition of positive-sense RNA levels observed, all three inhibitors reduced negative-sense RNA synthesis by <four-fold at all time points post-infection as compared to the DMSO control, as determined by semi-quantitative RT-PCR. Therefore, potential mechanisms of action for tomatidine, citalopram HBr, and Z-VEID-FMK involve inhibition of viral replication at a step ahead of and distinct from negative-strand RNA production. Post-infection efficacy was assessed for these inhibitors by performing a time of addition assay in which U-87MG cells were treated with inhibitors at the time of infection (0 h) with TC-83 at MOI 0.1 or at 2, 4, or 6 h post-infection ( Figure 5D ). A 2-h pretreatment control group was included in the assay in a similar manner, as previously described ( Figures 2B and 4B) . At 24 hpi, viral supernatants were assayed for infectious titers by plaque assay ( Figure 5E ) and intracellular lysates were assayed for positive-and negativesense RNA levels ( Figure 5F ). Tomatidine inhibited particle production by 38-fold and positive-sense RNA synthesis by 71-fold when cells were treated at the time of infection as compared to the DMSO control ( Figure 5D ,E) (p < 0.0001). These inhibition levels were similar to the reduction observed in the 2-h pretreatment control where a reduction in particle production was 41-fold and positive-sense RNA synthesis was~100-fold (p < 0.0001). Conversely, tomatidine inhibited TC-83 plaque production by <four-fold when cells were treated at 2, 4, or 6 h post-infection (p < 0.0021, p < 0.0001, p < 0.0002) ( Figure 5E ). A~10-15fold inhibition of positive-strand RNA levels was observed when tomatidine was added at 2, 4, or 6 h post-infection (p < 0.0001) ( Figure 5F ). Citalopram HBr and Z-VEID-FMK displayed consistent efficacy against TC-83 replication when administered at any time point post-infection, and inhibition was comparable to that observed in the context of pretreatment. Citalopram HBr inhibited plaque production by~300-fold when cells were treated at the time of infection or at 2, 4, or 6 h post-infection, as compared to the 500-fold reduction observed following the 2 h pretreatment (p < 0.0001) ( Figure 5E ). Similarly, Z-VEID-FMK reduced plaque production by~450-fold at the time of infection or at 2, 4, or 6 h post-infection as compared to the 600-fold inhibition observed following the 2 h pretreatment (p < 0.0001) ( Figure 5E ). Comparably, the reduction in positive-sense RNA synthesis was consistent upon treatment with Z-VEID-FMK as a~550-fold reduction was observed when cells were treated at the time of infection or 2, 4, or 6 h post-infection as compared to the 750-fold reduction observed in the 2 h pretreatment (p < 0.0001) ( Figure 5E ). The time of addition study with citalopram HBr fluctuated in inhibition of positive-sense RNA synthesis where a 600-fold reduction was observed at the time of infection (p < 0.0001), a 1000-fold was observed upon treatment at 2 and 4 h post-infection (p < 0.0001), but only a 100-fold reduction was observed upon treatment at 6 h post-infection (p < 0.0001) ( Figure 5E ). Similar to the previous experiment ( Figure 5C ), negative-strand RNA synthesis was relatively unaffected by the inhibitor treatments post-infection at < four-fold reduction in comparison to the DMSO control for all time of addition time points for all inhibitor treatments ( Figure 5D ) (p < 0.0001). Collectively, citalopram HBr and Z-VEID-FMK exhibited a more robust inhibition against TC-83 replication when administered at post-exposure time points when compared to tomatidine. These data also demonstrate that tomatidine, citalopram HBr, and Z-VEID-FMK can inhibit positive-strand, but not negative-strand synthesis following treatment of cells both pre-and post-infection. that tomatidine, citalopram HBr, and Z-VEID-FMK can inhibit positive-strand, but not negative-strand synthesis following treatment of cells both pre-and post-infection. qRT-PCR to measure positive strand expression levels (nsP3) and RT-PCR to measure expression levels of negative strand was performed, as described in Materials and Methods.

Tomatidine, tested at 10 and 20 \u03bcM concentrations, reduced EEEV replication by 157-fold and 314-fold, respectively, (p < 0.0001) in U-87MG cells ( Figure 7B ), 87-fold and 207-fold (p < 0.0001) in SVGp12 cells at 5 and 10\u03bcM ( Figure 7C) , and 238-fold and 259-fold (p < 0.0001) The cell type independence of these inhibitors against TrD was evaluated in both SVGp12 ( Figure 6D ) and HMC3 ( Figure 6E ) cells. Two concentrations of each inhibitor were used to pretreat cells which were subsequently infected with TrD at MOI 0.1 in the same manner, as previously described ( Figure 6A ).

Similar to data from U-87MG cells, tomatidine displayed greater efficacy against the TrD strain than against TC-83 ( Figure 2C ). Citalopram HBr inhibited TrD replication by~10-fold in both SVGp12 and HMC3 cells in a dose-independent manner at the indicated drug concentrations (p < 0.0001) and comparable to the inhibition observed with the TC-83 strain. Z-VEID-FMK inhibited TrD replication by 14-fold in both SVGp12 and HMC3 cells (p < 0.0001) and therefore, greater inhibition with this inhibitor was observed when compared to TC-83 ( Figure 3C,D) .",

The relevance of the host proteins, eukaryotic initiation factor 2 subunit 2 (eIF2S2), and transcription factor AP-2 alpha (TFAP2A) for TC-83 replication were first assessed using siRNA-mediated knockdown of the target proteins. eIF2S2 is the host protein in the immunoprecipitated pulldowns ( Figure 1A -C) predicted to be targeted by tomatidine ( Figure 1D ). TFAP2A is predicted to be targeted by citalopram HBr and Z-VEID-FMK ( Figure 1D ). Next, 293T cells were transfected with 25 or 50n M of siRNA targeting TFAP2A or eIF2S2 for 72 h and cell viability was measured to assess the toxicity of reduced host protein expression ( Figure  8A ). Transfection of 25 or 50 nM siRNA targeting TFAP2A and eIF2S2 did not compromise cell viability as compared to the transfection reagent control or the negative siRNA control. Cell viability was noted to be \u226594% for all conditions tested in Figure 8A . Then, 293T cells were transfected with 25 or 50 nM siRNA targeting eIF2S2 or TFAP2A for 72 h and infected with TC-83 at MOI 0.1 for 24 h ( Figure 8C ). Host protein knockdown was confirmed by Western blot for TFAP2A ( Figure 8C ) and eIF2S2 ( Figure 8D ), and supernatants were evaluated for infectious titers by plaque assay at 24 hpi from siRNA transfected cells ( Figure 8E ). Furthermore, 25 nM siRNA for TFAP2A reduced protein expression by 23% (ns) as compared to the mock-transfected cells ( Figure 8C ). However, 50 nM siRNA achieved a 75% knockdown (p < 0.0001) as compared to the mock-transfected cells, and a ~50% knockdown as compared to the negative siRNA control ( Figure 8C ). Transfection of 25 nM siRNA targeting eIF2S2 reduced protein expression by 55% as compared to the mock-transfected cells and the negative siRNA control (p < 0.0002) ( Figure 8D ), whereas 50 nM siRNA reduced protein expression by 76% (p < 0.0001) ( Figure 8D ).

            "text": "To estimate the relevance of host targets for these inhibitors in the context of alphavirus infection and siRNA knockdown experiments were carried out. The relevance of the host proteins, eukaryotic initiation factor 2 subunit 2 (eIF2S2), and transcription factor AP-2 alpha (TFAP2A) for TC-83 replication were first assessed using siRNA-mediated knockdown of the target proteins. eIF2S2 is the host protein in the immunoprecipitated pulldowns ( Figure 1A -C) predicted to be targeted by tomatidine ( Figure 1D ). TFAP2A is predicted to be targeted by citalopram HBr and Z-VEID-FMK ( Figure 1D ). Next, 293T cells were transfected with 25 or 50 nM of siRNA targeting TFAP2A or eIF2S2 for 72 h and cell viability was measured to assess the toxicity of reduced host protein expression ( Figure 8A ). Transfection of 25 or 50 nM siRNA targeting TFAP2A and eIF2S2 did not compromise cell viability as compared to the transfection reagent control or the negative siRNA control. Cell viability was noted to be \u226594% for all conditions tested in Figure 8A . Then, 293T cells were transfected with 25 or 50 nM siRNA targeting eIF2S2 or TFAP2A for 72 h and infected with TC-83 at MOI 0.1 for 24 h ( Figure 8C ). Host protein knockdown was confirmed by Western blot for TFAP2A ( Figure 8C ) and eIF2S2 ( Figure 8D ), and supernatants were evaluated for infectious titers by plaque assay at 24 hpi from siRNA transfected cells ( Figure 8E ). Furthermore, 25 nM siRNA for TFAP2A reduced protein expression by 23% (ns) as compared to the mock-transfected cells ( Figure 8C ). However, 50 nM siRNA achieved a 75% knockdown (p < 0.0001) as compared to the mock-transfected cells, and a~50% knockdown as compared to the negative siRNA control ( Figure 8C ). Transfection of 25 nM siRNA targeting eIF2S2 reduced protein expression by 55% as compared to the mocktransfected cells and the negative siRNA control (p < 0.0002) ( Figure 8D ), whereas 50 nM siRNA reduced protein expression by 76% (p < 0.0001) ( Figure 8D ). Viral supernatants, assayed for infectious particle production ( Figure 8E) , showed a modest reduction in TC-83 replication measured at 1.4-fold and 3.6-fold following 25 nM or 50 nM TFAP2A siRNA transfection, respectively (ns, p < 0.0021). However, a greater reduction in TC-83 replication was observed for the eIF2S2 knockdown ( Figure 8E ) in which 25 nM siRNA reduced TC-83 replication by 15-fold (p < 0.0002), and 50 nM reduced TC-83 replication by 74-fold (p < 0.0002).",

Next, 293 T cells were transfected with 50 nM eIF2S2 siRNA for 72 h or treated with 10 \u00b5M tomatidine for 2 h prior to transfection with 5 \u00b5g of TC-83 RNA containing the mutated stop codon or infection with the nano Luciferase expressing TC-83 virus (TaV-nLuc). Cells were lysed and processed for expression of VEEV nsP2 and eIF2S2 by Western blot (Figure 9A -C) or for luciferase expression ( Figure 9D ). Quantitative host protein knockdown of eIF2S2 was 71% as compared to the mock-transfected cells and 60% as compared to the negative siRNA control (p < 0.0002) ( Figure 9A,B) . Genomic translation levels were reduced by 37% following eIF2S2 knockdown as compared to translation in the non-siRNA transfected cells (p < 0.0002) ( Figure 9A,C) . In the presence of tomatidine treatment, genomic translation was reduced by 7% as compared to the untreated cells (p < 0.0332) ( Figure 9A,C) . Detection of luciferase activity was used as a measure of subgenomic translation (TaV-nLuc) [34] . The results ( Figure 9D ) revealed that reduction in eIF2S2 expression reduced TC-83 subgenomic luciferase activity by~1-fold as compared to the untreated, non-siRNA transfected control (WT) and the negative siRNA control groups (ns). Interestingly, a 12-fold decrease of luciferase activity was measured in the tomatidine-treated cells as compared to the untreated control (p < 0.0001). Taken together, these data suggest that eIF2S2 is important for the efficiency of VEEV genomic RNA translation, and supports previous studies indicating minimal reliance on eIF2 for subgenomic RNA translation.

            "text": "VEEV, a NW alphavirus, is both a public health and a bioweapon concern as it replicates readily to high titers while retaining infectivity in the form of an aerosol. The need for broad-spectrum, cell-type-independent therapeutic intervention strategies prompted us to examine the host protein interactome of VEEV nsP3 protein. Here, we report the efficacy of three small molecules that are FDA approved for alternate indications which demonstrate potent inhibition against VEEV and appear to possess broad spectrum antiviral activity. Tomatidine displayed the greatest inhibition of VEEV replication across multiple human cell types against both the wild-type and attenuated strains of VEEV, and against the related alphavirus EEEV. Citalopram HBr and Z-VEID-FMK were efficacious against VEEV TrD as well as EEEV, therefore demonstrating broad-spectrum potential against alphaviruses. Similarly, citalopram HBr and Z-VEID-FMK were effective when used as a post-exposure treatment against VEEV. Additionally, our studies reveal a potential interaction of VEEV nsP3 with TFAP2A in the absence and presence of citalopram HBr and Z-VEID-FMK, although knockdown of TFAP2A does not negatively impact TC-83 replication. Our data suggests a proviral role of eIF2S2 for TC-83 replication and genomic translation.",

            "text": "Tomatidine is a steroidal alkaloid that possesses antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties in macrophages [54] [55] [56] . Previously, tomatidine has been shown to reduce iNOS and COX-2 expression by interfering with the NF-\u03baB and JNK signaling pathways [57] . Inflammatory cytokines IL-1, IL-6, and IL-8 are stimulated during VEEV infection and these inflammatory mediators are also known to upregulate COX-2 [58, 59] . To that end, non-steroidal COX-2 inhibitors, such as celecoxib, have been shown to inhibit VEEV replication in vitro while other COX inhibitors have delayed disease symptoms in vivo [60, 61] . More recently, tomatidine has shown strong efficacy against the OW alphavirus, Chikungunya virus (CHIKV), as well as a flavivirus and dengue virus (DENV) [62, 63] . Potent antiviral activity of tomatidine was observed against these viruses with selectivity indexes calculated at 97.7 and 120 for DENV and CHIKV, respectively, compared to 70 observed in our study [62, 63] . Interestingly, the time of addition experiments with DENV showed tomatidine inhibiting viral particle production up to 12 h post-infection [62] , and up to 6 h with CHIKV [63] , whereas tomatidine appears to be efficacious only when added before or up to the time of infection when used against VEEV. In the case of CHIKV, direct incubation of tomatidine with the virus resulted in no inhibition of viral titer [63] , which suggests that its antiviral activity likely affects steps in the replication cycle following release of the nucleocapsid but prior to budding of progeny virions [62, 63] . Tomatidine disrupts eIF2S2 activity, which can affect VEEV replication as this protein appears to possess a proviral role. Eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2) forms a ternary complex with GTP to mediate the binding of tRNA i Met to the ribosome to facilitate protein synthesis, and is comprised of three subunits: alpha (eIF2S1), beta (eIF2S2), and gamma (eIF2S3) [48] . In the case of OW alphavirus, SINV, subgenomic RNA translation is independent of eIF2 activity [51, 52] . A stable RNA hairpin motif present slightly downstream to the AUG start codon in the subgenomic RNA is conserved among OW and NW alphaviruses, and in SINV, is responsible for the eIF2-independent translation [49, 50, 64] . Our data demonstrate that eIF2S2 aids in translation of the viral genomic RNA, but not the subgenomic RNA, similarly to SINV [49] [50] [51] [52] . Interestingly, genomic RNA translation was modestly affected by treatment with tomatidine, but subgenomic RNA translation was significantly reduced. Nevertheless, our bioinformatics analyses successfully provided a two-fold identification of a small molecule inhibitor and a host target of interest with VEEV nsP3.",

            "text": "Depletion of TFAP2A had little to no impact on VEEV replication, which is unsurprising given that the full-length genome encodes its own proteins for transcribing the negative-, positive-and subgenomic-RNA strands, and thus a direct role for TFAP2A in viral RNA synthesis appears unlikely. However, the inhibitors identified as putatively targeting TFAP2A displayed efficacy against VEEV, which may suggest an indirect role for TFAP2A in the VEEV replication cycle, or that the antiviral activity of these inhibitors is due to off-target effects on proteins/pathways other than TFAP2A. Caspase-induced apoptosis occurs during alphavirus infection, and in the case of SINV and Semliki Forest virus (SFV), caspase-3 is activated by viral cleavage of the Bcl-2 family of oncogenes to prevent host cell death, and is used as a mechanism of protection [65, 66] . However, treatment with a different caspase-3 inhibitor, Z-VAD-FMK, reduced SINV-induced cellular death but did not significantly affect viral particle production in BHK-J cells [66] . In another study, Bcl-2 cleavage was blocked during treatment with Z-VAD-FMK prior to SFV infection, thereby preventing apoptosis. However, it is unclear whether reduction in cell death is due to lack of caspase-3 activation or intact Bcl-2. Similarly, Z-VAD-FMK did not reduce the translation of viral proteins or infectious particle production [65, 67] . Our data support further investigation into the mechanism by which Z-VEID-FMK reduces infectious particle production. Relatedly, the FDA-approved SSRI, citalopram HBr, typically used to treat depression, was also shown to decrease apoptosis in osteoblast cells in vitro [45, 68] . Research investigating potential antiviral activity mediated by citalopram HBr against alphaviruses is lacking, but ex vivo studies have demonstrated that treatment with the SSRI decreased human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) replication in both macrophages and in latently infected T-cells [69] . Taken together, these two small molecules display comparable efficacy against VEEV during viral kinetic and post-addition assays and therefore, may target related or similar host pathways to negatively affect viral propagation.",

Our data suggest that utilizing overexpression constructs expressing viral proteins combined with mass spectrometry and bioinformatic analyses can identify host interaction partners and small molecules of interest that may be repurposed for novel uses. Future studies will be aimed toward defining the mechanistic basis for the antiviral activity of these small molecules and determining their efficacy against alphaviruses in vivo.",
