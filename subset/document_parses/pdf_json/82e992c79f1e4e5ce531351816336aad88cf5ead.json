            "text": "Endotracheal intubation is considered a critical practice in emergency medical care, intensive care medicine and anesthesia to maintain a secure and clear airway [1] . It is an invasive performance that requires complex psychomotor skills especially in demand during the COVID-19 pandemic. The degree of success of intubation is traditionally evaluated by the time required and the achievement of both-lung ventilation. Intubation may also be evaluated by additional indicators such as applied force and glottic view that could affect patient outcome [2] . Proficient physicians should be able to adjust their techniques according to patients' conditions to maintain an airway and provide ventilation within a short period [3] ; their force applied on the incisor should be minimized during intubation with any technique [4] [5] [6] , and they should be able to obtain a good laryngeal view [7] . In general, the success of intubation is associated with the patient's condition, intubation devices used, and physicians' level of competence [3] . A critical viewpoint has argued that the key contributor to success rate and intubation quality is the operator's competence [8, 9] . Since seniority is one of the requirements for performing difficult airway management, in cases where patients have difficult airway conditions, senior physicians often play rescuing roles. Indeed, plenty of guidelines suggest involving senior personnel when making decisions, diagnoses, and when performing difficult intubations [9, 10] . Although previous retrospective studies to evaluate the impact of wearing personal protective equipment during endotracheal intubation in the COVID-19 pandemic have reported that seniority is correlated with intubation success rate [11] , other studies have argued that seniority is a poor predictor of expertise or proficiency [12, 13] . Expertise depends more on the volume of deliberate practice in which an individual has engaged.",

Formal medical education in Taiwan involves a seven-year undergraduate training (UGY), and students are required to take national licensing exams at the end of the 7 th year. Licensed physicians are required to complete a one-year postgraduate training (PGY) for general medicine training and a four-year emergency medicine residency training (R) in order to become an attending physician (VS).",

This design offered sufficient demonstration and practice time for learners to become familiar with the devices and intubation on the manikin but was not intended as an intervention. The simulators we used included \"Laerdal 1 Airway Management Trainer and MW13: DAM Simulator Training Model\". The training scenarios included difficult mouth openings, limitation of neck flexibility, and tongue swelling. We did not standardize the number of attempts during the 30-minute practice section, but instead gauged readiness according to learners' self-perception. At the end, each learner was assessed over 12 intubations (4 scenarios \u00d7 3 devices) that were always presented in the same order. Learners were assessed on a fixed sequence of four scenarios using direct laryngoscopy, Trachway 1 , and then Glidescope 1 .

All effects were reported as significant at p< 0.05. Sample size was estimated for a Chi-square test and a repeated measure ANOVA using GPower 3.1 [14] . As there was no prior evidence for physician seniority, estimates were set based on a large effect size of 0.5 for the Chi-square test and 0.4 for repeated measure ANOVA, with a correlation among repeated measures of 0.3, an alpha of 0.05, and a statistical power of 0.8 [15] .

Given a 44% overall success rate across all seniorities, intubation appears quite difficult under the provided scenarios. It seems none of the groups are proficient enough to do well in these scenarios. Moreover, the non-significant main effect suggests that our learners' intubation speeds were not facilitated by increasing seniority, although previous study has reported a positive correlation [16, 17] . However, when intubation devices were taken into account, the significant interaction between seniority and device suggests that intubation performance was affected by different learners' seniority, but the effect depended on the devices used. The result shows that the use of video-laryngoscopy enhances the intubation speed of learners as reported in earlier study [18] . Indeed, previous experimental investigations have suggested that videolaryngoscopy provides a better laryngeal view and improves the first-attempt success rate and speed, compared to direct laryngoscopy [7, 19, 20] .

Moreover, the maximum applied force on incisor and tongue did not differ across seniority. The forces measured in the current study were much higher than in previous studies [4, 6, 23] .

            "text": "Although the mean peak force was substantially lower than the 200N that would cause front teeth breakage of normal incisors, we recorded 25 attempts by both juniors and seniors that reached this force, out of the 600 intubations in total. We cannot ignore the fact that the greatest number of these attempts with the greatest force on the incisors were by senior physicians. We also identified an increase of at least 9N with senior physicians (R and VS) compared to UGY and PGY. Moreover, increases of 11N applied on the tongue were recorded with seniors, compared to juniors. As we know, the glossopharyngeal nerve is positioned superior to the anterior surface of the epiglottis, and the vagus nerve has sensory pathways running distally from the posterior epiglottis to the lower airway. The pressure of laryngoscopy during endotracheal intubation will stimulate both nerves and may cause lethal cardiovascular responses [24, 25] . Therefore, minimizing the applied laryngoscopy force could reduce the haemodynamic response, as well as the local tissue trauma associated with intubation [26] . Accordingly, the laryngoscopy force applied to the soft tissues of the oral mucosa should be reduced as the physician's seniority and competence in the quality of their care increases. Although that increased level of force applied may not cause severe complications with patients' oral soft tissue, it does still represent a blemish on our senior physicians' intubation quality record. A recent study also reported the same finding that more experienced anesthetists generated higher peak dental forces during manikin laryngoscopy than less experienced individuals [6] . Thus, we employed a psychological perspective to understand the findings. Our results revealed that there may have been a speed-force trade-off: novice physicians focused on precision at a slower pace, whereas senior physicians emphasized speed with conditional accuracy. Experienced physicians might accept higher dental force in order to accomplish a difficult intubation, knowing that a failed intubation may risk life-threatening complications, such as hypoxemia and regurgitation or death, as compared to \"mere\" dental trauma [27, 28] . Previous qualitative study examining general emergency care practices has highlighted novice-expert differences in cognitive patterns [29] . Novice physicians rely on what has been learned and follow guidance and standard procedures; in this case, best visualization of the glottis and insertion within the appropriate range. Failures of novices are mostly associated with the lack of ability to solve the situation, and thus fewer successful attempts and less speed are expected. On the other hand, experienced physicians identify key inferences and integrate essential information into the diagnosis, leading to \"pre-programming\" from their extensive experience. This then produces fast and effortless intubation. However, performance is largely based on prior experience, and focus of attention, whereby strong habit intrusions may affect the diagnosis of rare medical cases, or some information and clinical steps that were missed if beyond their attention [30] . Previous survey-based national study has reported the same findings: more senior anesthesiologists achieved lower accuracy in grading the overall health status of a patient; i.e., more experienced personnel made judgements based on their clinical experiences rather than on the standards and criteria [31] .",

Learners who enrolled in the training course, especially juniors, may be, or may perceive themselves as, less competent or more motivated to learn.

Second, we did not measure objective data that could indicate whether the 4 groups (UGY, PGY, R, VS) differed in expertise with regard to any of the intubation techniques and manikins. Familiarity could have influenced their performance, which may explain medical students' superior performance. Moreover, we did not control the learners' number of attempts during the practice section and assessment; we only analyzed their first attempt at each scenario. Learners with a higher number of attempts may have benefitted from a practice effect and thereby improved their performance in later scenarios. Also, we did not deploy devices that are more specifically recommended with respect to the particular scenarios. According to the Difficult Airway Society 2015 guidelines for the management of unanticipated difficult intubation in adults, supraglottic airway device (SAD) or flexible fiberscope may be more suitable than laryngoscopy [10] . Furthermore, Kyoto-Kagaku MW11 difficult airway management simulator was developed at Waseda University in 2006 to serve as an active training device and as an advanced evaluation tool for surgical instruments and medical procedures [32, 33] . The simulator was built based on the concepts of a Japanese anesthesia textbook (Tracheal Intubation Visual Manual of Clinical Basic Techniques) [34] .

To the best of our knowledge, our study is the first to incorporate all intubation variables (i.e., physicians, devices used, and intubation scenarios) into the investigation. A comprehensive training program encompassing knowledge, clinical skills and capabilities is necessary for the education of junior physicians, while senior physicians should be aware of habit intrusions that have been \"preprogrammed\" from their extensive experiences; effective and regular learning opportunities contribute to the updating of knowledge and refreshing of skills. A tool that emphasizes practice and efficiency should be designed and implemented to educate junior physicians, which could also contribute to the updating of senior physicians' knowledge and competence by providing instant feedback on their performance. Such fine-grained feedback could serve as a complement to traditional training and provide a sustainable learning model for medical education.",
