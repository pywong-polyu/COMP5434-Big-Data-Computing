            "text": "Background and purpose: Pertussis is a serious infectious disease in young infants, and severe cases frequently cause death. Our study explored risk factors for death from severe pertussis. Method: A case-control study of infants with severe pertussis admitted to the paediatric intensive care unit (PICU) in the Children', was conducted. Pertussis was confirmed by clinical features and laboratory examinations. Severe pertussis was defined as patients with pertussis resulting in PICU admission or death. To understand the risk factors for death, we compared fatal and nonfatal cases of severe pertussis in infants aged < 120 days by collecting clinical and laboratory data. Results: The participants included 63 infants < 120 days of age with severe pertussis. Fifteen fatal cases were confirmed and compared with 44 nonfatal severe pertussis cases, Four patients with termination of treatment were excluded. In the univariate analysis, the risk factors associated with death included apnoea (P = 0.001), leukocytosis (white blood cell (WBC) count\u226530 \u00d7 10 9 /L (P = 0.001) or \u2265 50 \u00d7 10 9 /L (P = 0)), highest lymphocyte count (P = 0), pulmonary hypertension (P = 0.001), and length of PICU stay (P = 0.003). The multivariate analysis revealed that apnoea (OR 23.722,, P = 0.004), leukocytosis (OR 63.708, 95%CI 3.574-1135.674, P = 0.005) and pulmonary hypertension (OR 26.109, 95%CI 1.800-378.809, P = 0.017) were significantly associated with death. Conclusion: Leukocytosis and pulmonary hypertension exhibited the greatest associations with death in infants with severe pertussis admitted to the PICU. Vaccination is still the most effective protection method against pertussis.",

            "text": "Pertussis is an acute respiratory infection caused by Bordetella pertussis and is characterized by paroxysmal coughing, coughing ending in a whooping sound, vomiting, apnoea or cyanosis [1] . The World Health Organization (WHO) estimated that 151,074 pertussis cases occurred in 2018 and 89,000 pertussis deaths occurred in 2008 (http://www.who.int/ith/diseases/pertussis/en/). However, even after widespread vaccination with the DTaP, reported pertussis cases substantially increased and are still increasing in China. The current programme for pertussis vaccination in China is administration of 1 dose at 3, 4, and 5 months of age and 1 increased dose at 18-24 months of age. At present, there is no programme for pertussis immunization during pregnancy [2, 3] . According to the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, 32,452 cases of pertussis were reported in 2011-2017, with an annual incidence 0.34 per 100,000 individuals; 60% of cases were in infants \u22645 months old. Hence, pertussis remains a serious disease in China, particularly in those too young to have completed their vaccination course. However, data on severe pertussis and death due to pertussis in China are scarce. Chongqing, a city in Western China, is among the top five cities with the highest pertussis prevalence [3] . To elucidate the status of severe pertussis in Chongqing, we collected data from January 2013 to July 2019 at the Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University. The numbers of severe pertussis cases and deaths in < 120day-old infants are shown in Fig. 1 ; both cases and deaths increased annually between 2016 and 2019. To gain further insight into the characteristics and treatment of severe pertussis and to determine the most important risk factors associated with death, we analysed data from < 120-day-old infants with severe pertussis.",

All cases were confirmed by isolation of B. pertussis by culture or detection of B. pertussis DNA by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays. Severe pertussis was defined as patients with pertussis resulting in PICU admission. The case group was defined as pertussis patients admitted to the PICU and dying from pertussis disease.

Currently, in severe pertussis cases, leukocytosis and lymphocytosis are commonly observed and are significantly correlated with death [6, 10, [12] [13] [14] [15] . Pertussis toxin (PT) indirectly leads to the development of pulmonary hypertension through the induction of lymphocytosis (leukocytosis). The aggregation of leukocytes in pulmonary arterioles, veins and the lymphatic system was observed in the lungs of pertussis-infected infants after death [16] [17] [18] . In our study, leukocytosis was significantly associated with death, similar to the results of other publications. Only 2 patients with fatal outcomes did not present leukocytosis in our study. One patient had comorbid trisomy 21 syndrome with an ASD and a maximum WBC count of 16.58 \u00d7 10 9 /L. This infant was coinfected with RSV and diagnosed with severe pneumonia and ARDS. The second infant was admitted after cardiopulmonary resuscitation due to asphyxia. Pertussis was diagnosed after admission. The maximum WBC count was 23.19 \u00d7 10 9 /L. It is possible that asphyxia and leukocytosis were significantly related to pertussis infection. Both patients died of respiratory failure without pulmonary hypertension.",

            "text": "Of greatest importance in the treatment of pertussis is the administration of a macrolide antibiotic. PICU management of infant pertussis cases has been limited [17, 19, 20] . Extreme leukocytosis with lymphocytosis is associated with infant death [10] . Pertussis toxin (PT)-promoted leukocytosis and indirect development of pulmonary hypertension are the most important risk factors related to death in patients with severe pertussis. Could death be reduced by rapidly reducing leukocytes and lymphocytes in patients with severe pertussis? In 2004, Romano et al. published the first report on ET in a patient with severe pertussis [21] ; thereafter, ET has been reported in multiple case reports of severe pertussis treatment [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] . According to previous research, although there is a lack of a unified standard, ET showed potential therapeutic benefits and promising results and is worthy of future exploration [18, 21, 25, 27, 29] . In Abbreviations: CI confidence interval, OR odds ratio Leukocytosis was defined as WBC count \u226530 \u00d7 10 9 /L our study, 5 patients were treated with ET, of whom 3 died. The peak WBC count of patients in the fatal group who underwent ET was significantly higher than that in the nonfatal group. Although there was no significant difference between the two groups treated with ET, the variations may be related to the time of treatment onset and the severity of illness; however, this needs to be confirmed by additional standardized control studies in the future. ECMO has a long history of use in the treatment of severe pertussis in young infants, but there is no consensus on its efficacy; however, it has been shown to have some clinical benefits [26, 27, [30] [31] [32] . In our research, ECMO was performed in only 1 patient in the fatal group. We observed no significant difference between the two groups treated with ECMO and ET, likely because these treatments were initiated only when the disease became life-threatening; however, these treatments still might play a potential role in severe pertussis.",

In our study, the majority of our infants were < 3 months of age, but 2 patients received one dose of the pertussis vaccine. Although the two patients were vaccinated, they began to cough before vaccination, and pertussis infection was considered. For this reason, many countries have already recommended that the initial vaccination scheme should start at 6 weeks of age. Since 2011, many countries have vaccinated pregnant women between 27 and 36 weeks gestation with the DTaP vaccine to prevent infection and death in infants \u22642 months old [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] .

All the patients in our study had varying degrees of hypoxemia and required respiratory support (59 invasive and 4 noninvasive); thus, their conditions were very serious, and a high mortality rate was observed, which explains why we had a limited number of cases. In addition, 10 infants did not undergo echocardiography, and heart and pulmonary artery conditions were unknown. Meanwhile, we could not collect the smoking habits of patients' parents to determine whether any connection existed between pertussis and smoking.",

Leukocytosis and pulmonary hypertension are the greatest risk factors for death in infants with severe pertussis. Currently, the treatment of severe pertussis is limited and should be improved. ET and ECMO are also worth exploring as treatments, but additional data are needed. Vaccination is still the most effective protection method. Considering that \u22643 months of age is a risk factor for severe pertussis, our national vaccination schedule needs to be changed to protect infants in this age group. ",
