Semi-structured interviews with 30 community college librarians who had instruction duties explored the state of the implementation of the Framework in community colleges and the effect of the recent pandemic on information literacy instruction (ILI). The Framework is most lauded for its effect on the design and delivery of instruction, but its components mainly underpin ILI rather than explicitly taught. The pandemic limited one-shot information literacy instruction but opened up opportunities for embedding librarianship in online courses. The value of this study lies in the potential for identifying opportunities for improving ILI in community colleges, based on a better understanding of librarians' attitudes and experiences of their instructional roles. Community college librarians with responsibility for ILI can be more fully supported when their instructional challenges are better understood.

They are also diverse in their educational goals: some seek associate degrees and transfer to a four-year institution, some seek credentials and skills to facilitate employment, some are engaged in remedial education, and some are high school students completing college credits early.

This has become more apparent as higher education has begun transitioning from the Information Literacy Competency Standards for Higher Education (ACRL, 2000) to the Framework for Information Literacy for Higher Education (Framework) (ACRL, 2016) . The difference between these two sets of standards is nontrivial. The old \"standards\" defined information literacy as a set of specific skills.

It is also unique in its ability to capture ILI activities during the COVID-19 shutdown. When this research was planned, it was not possible to know that COVID-19 was lurking around the corner.

Several years in the making, it called for a paradigmatic change in how librarians in institutions of higher education think about, teach, and assess the attainment of information literacy.

In place of an established skill set, information literacy now focuses on six threshold concepts: (1) Authority Is Constructed and Contextual, (2) Information Creation as a Process, (3) Information has Value, (4) Research as Inquiry, (5) Scholarship as Conversation, (6) Searching as Strategic Exploration.

Some writers question the suitability of the Framework for community college students (Leeder, 2015; Ludovico, 2017; Nelson, 2017; Reed, 2015) . Other concerns voiced suggest that it does not address social justice issues (Battisa et al., 2015) , is abstruse (Jackman & Weiner, 2017), and does not support learning information literacy skills that are expected in the workplace (Nelson, 2017) . Others disagree. Swanson (2014) supports the use of the Framework in community colleges, and Calia-Lotz describes how she uses the Framework as a pedagogical foundation in her ILI (2020).

Nonetheless, several negative associations with the Framework were expressed. Respondents felt excluded from the creation of the document and believed that those involved did not understand community college students. They reported that the Framework has had little impact on ILI. In line with this was wide support for the idea of developing a version of the Framework adapted to J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f the needs of community colleges. However, those who were working with the Framework reported that it improved their instruction, and many respondents indicated an interest in learning more about the Framework, asking for applications geared exclusively for the community college context.",

Based on 760 responses, the survey found less reliance on the one-shot than the Wengler and Wolff-Eisenberg survey, but also included a variety of ILI types such as individualized instruction, making instructional materials available, credit courses, and lectures and demonstrations. Respondents did not evidence extreme views of the Framework, but did note limitations to using the Framework such as its conceptual nature and use of jargon, time limits for instruction that favor skills-based approaches, and the need for buy-in on the part of faculty. Successes in using the Framework centered on teaching about sources, citations, and plagiarism; helping students understand abstract concepts; teaching about the information life cycle; and, increasing student engagement. The study reported here sought to further explore these findings with community college librarians.",

With decreases in enrollment came the cessation of most, if not all, face-to-face contact with students, a drop in the number of one-shots provided, and an increase in online and embedded services. These librarians quickly moved to record and post content on library websites and offer it to instructors for their classes. In this period of transition, librarians became more aware that many students struggle with technology and because of this were in danger of falling through the cracks. Participants voiced concerns about students losing connections with other people and the fate of students dealing with housing insecurity. As Neil put it, \"COVID-19 has changed our life completely.\" The normal practice of going to where students are or hosting them in the library largely stopped. As Sara stated, \"Library instruction requests have decreased substantially.\" Another participant, Allen, described current practice saying, So now we are not typically getting invited to give a live presentation on an online course, but we do have our library that has the information that we used to show in classes and faculty and students can access it\u2026So what we used to say face to face is now recorded on YouTube and professors need to show it in class. They can get it there and it's easy to access through our library website. Others were able to make the transition to visiting online classes. \"Now during COVID\u2026it's completely remote. So, we usually, uh, ask the professor to provide us, uh, their virtual room link and we meet them there\" (Inez).

However, in one case, at the institutional level, the quality enhancement plan (QEP) focuses on IL and the library was incorporating the Framework into their response. Another participant reported that their QEP guiding committee is looking to embed librarians into general education courses. While this news is exciting in one respect, the respondent reasonably wondered how, given the size of the library staff, this goal could be accomplished. In another instance, the library selected as one of its goals for their annual discipline report to incorporate and evaluate one frame, Searching as Strategic Exploration, into their ILI.",
