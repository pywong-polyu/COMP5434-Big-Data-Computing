This technical article outlines a procedure for developing computerized discrete-trial training programs using commonly available software, as well as a description of how to adapt this strategy to teach chained tasks remotely. Within this article, we describe how to establish unidirectional and bidirectional remote interfaces to work directly with learners. Finally, we conducted a field test of these approaches with programs adapted from two standardized curricula: PEAK and PRISM. We conclude the article by discussing barriers and potential solutions that we observed while field-testing these procedures within special education settings in response to the wide-scale emigration to remote teaching due to the COVID-19 pandemic.",

            "text": "Among the several dimensions of applied behavior analysis are the generality and transportability of intervention technologies (Baer, Wolf, & Risley, 1968; Quigley, Blevins, Cox, Brodhead, & Kim, 2019) . Setting generality refers to the transfer of efficacious intervention outcomes to natural settings where behavior change is most likely to result in reinforcement for the client (Rincover & Koegel, 1975) . Transportability in intervention research can be defined as \"the movement of efficacious treatments to usual-care settings\" (Schoenwald & Hoagwood, 2001 , p. 1192 and may be especially important in the context of treatment for children with disabilities. More recently in the evolution of behavioranalytic services, generality and transportability are augmented through telehealth models that make use of electronic information and telecommunication technologies to deliver services from a distance (Pellegrino & DiGennaro Reed, 2020) . For example, Pellegrino and DiGennaro Reed (2020) used videoconferencing to establish chained home-cooking tasks across two adults with intellectual disabilities. As noted by LeBlanc et al. (2020) , although telehealth strategies have been emerging within behavior analysis over the past 2 decades, many behavior analysts have had to become rapidly familiar with these approaches due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In the current technological article, we describe a set of procedures for promoting the transportability of language and cognitive training delivered through discrete-trial instruction. Additionally, we field-tested this strategy within a standardized program (i.e., PEAK Relational Training System; see Dixon et al., 2017a; Dixon, Belisle, Munoz, Stanley, & Rowsey, 2017b ) using a familiar stimulus-building platform (e.g., Microsoft PowerPoint) and delivering the content remotely using commercially available telecommunication technologies (e.g., Zoom). By building computerized programs and delivering content directly through telecommunication, behavior analysts can deliver instruction remotely in the context where behavior change may be most preferable and can quickly adapt to public health crises. Ferguson et al. (2019) conducted a systematic review of telehealth approaches to behavior-analytic interventions with individuals with autism, locating 28 studies that met the inclusion criteria and involving a total of 307 participants with autism. Results suggested that interventionist training delivered through telehealth allowed for successful interventions that addressed one or more target behaviors. The majority of strategies included functional analyses to address challenging behavior (43%) and naturalistic training of adaptive skills (36%). From our own review of the literature, few studies have attempted to deliver training directly through the telecommunication interface, instead relying on implementation by a caregiver. However, discrete-trial training strategies such as those used in PEAK or other curricular packages may allow for direct work with a remote interventionist (i.e., telehealth direct therapy). Ferguson et al. (2019) also noted a low quality within current research on telehealth within behavior-analytic interventions for individuals with autism. Using a standardized strategy for material development and content delivery through telecommunication [could allow for more high quality evaluations of behavior analytic services delivered remotely]. In addition, if used within a standardized assessment and curriculum such as PEAK as was done in this article, this could confer an additional advantage of streamlining approaches across multiple intervention targets to further augment greater structure across multiple programs.",

However, the strategies described here are not specific to any single program or curriculum. In particular, these strategies can be used to develop and deliver both expressive and receptive communication training directly through a remote training interface within a comprehensive telehealth approach. Although prior tutorials have described how to develop discrete-trial training software using tools like Microsoft PowerPoint (e.g., Cummings & Saunders, 2019) , the current article extends this work by delineating between receptive and expressive targets, allowing for the recording of learner responses within receptive communication training, and delivering the content through a remote interface.",

Remote service delivery affords the advantage of continuing programming in the context of natural disasters that can restrict in-person delivery. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the shutdown of three in-person special education programs, we were able to initiate a field test of PEAK programming across two sites and adapt the strategy to teach chained responding using another related curriculum developed by the same research team (i.e., LIFE, Dixon, 2021) . Fieldtesting allows technology developers to test the feasibility of a new technology prior to disseminating the technology for future use and empirical evaluation. We had the opportunity to provide the tutorials for creating stimuli and initiating remote interfaces to novel implementers to ensure they could develop materials and deliver training given the instructions contained in this article. We also had the opportunity to identify potential barriers and obtain feedback on potential solutions when using these tools within a telehealth model.",

Two examples include a \"yes\" or \"no\" response (e.g., when shown a picture of a cat and asked \"Is this a cat?\" the learner may respond vocally with the word \"yes\") or an open-ended vocal response (e.g., when shown a picture of a cat and asked \"What is this?\" the learner may respond with the vocal word \"cat\"). In echoic programs, the expressive response is formally identical or similar to the discriminative stimulus. In tact programs, the expressive response is contingent on the physical features of the stimulus and maintained by generalized reinforcement (e.g., praise). In manding programs, the response is under the control of specific motivating operations and discriminative stimuli signaling the availability of the requested item. The procedures that follow are adaptable enough to allow for the development of several forms of expressive verbal behavior training.",

Microsoft PowerPoint can allow for greater customizability when developing new programs that may be especially useful for more advanced programs, such as those that appear later in comprehensive curricula such as PEAK (e.g., deictic, \"What do you see?\" and \"What do I see?\"). Boom Cards allow for built-in feedback systems and automatically track the percentage of correct responding. We encourage our technicians to select the development tool that best fits the program being converted to an online platform. A progression series for each is shown in Figures 1 and 2 . To develop an expressive communication program using this format, open Microsoft PowerPoint and select the blank design template. On the first slide, place a square at the top left of the screen and number the square \"1.\" Copy and paste the square and number the next square \"2.\" Continue this process until the number of squares is equal to the number of potential target stimuli. For example, if a program contains eight discriminative stimuli, then eight squares should be created and laid out on the screen with equal spacing. Once done, this screen will be used by the implementer to quasirandomize the delivery of the discriminative stimulus. On the second slide, build the first discriminative stimulus. For example, in the PEAK Direct Training (DT) program \"Tacting Animals,\" the first discriminative stimulus may be a picture of a dog. On the third slide, build the second discriminative stimulus. Continue this process until the number of discriminative stimuli equals the number of squares on Slide 1 (e.g., eight). On the final slide, go to Objects and select the button that resembles a return arrow (see Figure 1 ). Place this button in the middle of the screen. Above the button, add a text box and the text \"That is correct!\" and place the text above the button. Your slide distribution should resemble that shown in Figure 2 . The positive-feedback slide can be adjusted to contain any visual feedback developed by the implementer.",

Developing Slide Decks Using Boom Cards Commercially Available Software. Note. Decks are developed initially by the implementer. Random presentation is achieved by the program. The user selection response is recorded by touching or clicking the stimulus. Feedback is provided in the form of a green circle around the correct selection, and the implementer progresses to the next trial in the block learner. A parent or caregiver may need to set up the connection at the beginning of each training session. At the onset of the meeting time, join the session by selecting \"My Meetings,\" locating the meeting, and selecting \"Join.\" We encourage readers to name the meetings with a convention that allows for smooth service delivery, such as denoting the implementer (e.g., JB), the learner (e.g., NC), and the session number (e.g., 5) in the meeting name (e.g., \"Session JBNC5\"). The learner follows these same steps to join the session. This activates a two-way visual-audio connection between the implementer and the learner. If the learner is using an iPad or other touch screen device, we recommend locking the device so that the learner cannot close the session or engage with other applications. To share the PowerPoint slideshow with the learner, left-click the green \"Share\" button located at the bottom middle of the screen, as shown in Figure 3 . From the available share options, select the PowerPoint slideshow you developed previously. This will share your program with the learner. Then, run the slideshow. At this stage, the learner should see the implementer in the top-left corner of the screen and the implementer selection array. Because this is a unidirectional interface, only the implementer can control the program. The learner can also hear the implementer. The implementer should also see and control the selection array, as well as see the learner in the top-left corner of the screen. The implementer can also hear the learner, which is critical for expressive programs. Now, the implementer can simply run the program as designed through the Zoom interface. Audible instructions and prompts can be delivered by the implementer to the learner through this interface, and responses can be recorded manually by the implementer throughout instruction, like when conducting in-person programming. If the implementer wishes to record the session for review or to obtain interobserver agreement, this can be achieved by selecting the \"Record\" option within the Share menu that is made available while the screen is being shared.

The LIFE curriculum includes a list of 184 vocational/life skill targets that range from simple life skills (e.g., getting dressed) to more complex vocational skills (e.g., handling currency at a retail location). Program development from within a remote medium differs minimally from in-person programming. Once a list of target programs has been identified, the implementer develops a task analysis that is used to chain the complex behavior. The task analysis can be developed by performing the skill and recording the steps, observing another learner perform the skill and recording the steps, or recruiting an expert to develop a list of steps. A major consideration within an online platform may involve the inclusion of caregivers in the development of the task analysis. Contextual factors can differ markedly across locations that may influence the steps within the task analysis. For example, if you are using a remote system to teach getting dressed, the steps required to access the clothes may differ based on the location of the clothes, as well as the desired destination for worn clothes. An advantage of this system is the ability to teach the behavior directly within the context within which the behavior is likely to occur, while minimizing travel and intrusive observation conditions that may result from in-person training within the home context. Zoom can be used for interfacing LIFE targets or other chained task targets in the same way as described previously. ",

Next, build the first array slide for the second discriminative stimulus. Repeat the link and copy-and-paste sequence.

This will initiate the program unidirectionally, meaning only the implementer can manipulate the program.

Additionally, whereas in expressive programs the implementer can hear the learner response, seeing the learner response is difficult if they are touching the screen, such as when running this using a tablet. The bidirectional interface needs to be initiated on the learner's end. Have the caregiver hover their mouse over the slideshow. The option \"Take Remote Control\" should appear at the top of the screen, as shown in Figure 5 . Left-click this option. The implementer and the learner can now both control the screen, allowing the implementer to control the slide progression, and the learner to progress to the positive-feedback slide by selecting the correct comparison stimulus.

A challenge experienced by the first sites involved teaching learners to interact with the remote interface when a person was not immediately present. The implementers at these sites established a new PEAK program using the customized template located at the end of the PEAK-DT module. This PEAK program involved the presentation of a circle located on the screen. To obtain the reinforcer, the learner simply had to touch the circle on the screen. Each trial relocated the circle so that the learner had to track the location of the circle and touch the screen. Occasionally, caregivers were recruited in the initial stages of this training to physically prompt the touch response and to fade the physical prompt until the independent selection response was established. Subsequent programs involved replacing the circle with pictures used within programming (e.g., a dog and a frog), then introducing an auditory discriminative stimulus presented by the implementer (e.g., \"Find dog\"). Once the learners mastered this step, the sites were able to introduce new PEAK programs. The primary lesson that we learned was that remote delivery may require developing new programs that specifically teach learners to interact in this new medium before progressing to programs that already exist within the PEAK modules.",

To solve this barrier, we adapted a rival/model training paradigm reported by Dixon, Belisle, Munoz et al. (2017) . In rival/model training, the implementer delivers the discriminative stimulus and instruction, and a trained adult model engages in the correct response and obtains reinforcement from the implementer. Through vicariousreinforcement observational-learning processes, the learner may additionally demonstrate the response without direct training. At the first site, this procedure had been attempted in the classroom to establish vocal imitation, which is difficult to physically prompt. In a remote-delivery format, the site had the caregiver serve as the rival model. The implementer delivered the instruction and discriminative stimulus, the caregiver engaged in the response, and the caregiver received the reinforcer. Testing was then conducted to determine if the learner also engaged in the response. The caregiver response was then faded out so that the implementer could deliver the instruction and discriminative stimulus that successfully evoked the learner response.",

Many implementers within an in-person format likely embed subtle social reinforcers (e.g., smiling, laughing, overt indicators of excitement) in addition to larger programmed reinforcers (e.g., contingent breaks with preferred tangible items). We observed that the removal of these subtle social reinforcers in addition to the loss of the ability to manage and deliver many programmed reinforcers could negatively impact remote delivery of our programming. The first and third sites resolved this barrier in two ways. First, because of the video interface, social reinforcers can be delivered, but they cannot be subtle. Both sites achieved success by encouraging their implementers to become more animated in the delivery of social praise and to evoke attending behavior in the learner by engaging in preferred scripts (e.g., acting like an animal such as a moose) or, for more advanced learners, to engage in preferred conversations (e.g., discussing Star Wars characters in between trials). Success was also achieved by ensuring that the social reinforcement strategies were developed with the individualized interests of the students in mind, and both sites reported a desire to use more of these strategies within in-person programming to increase learner engagement.",

For example, the first site embedded preferred YouTube videos that were presented to the participants for a fixed duration contingent on a certain number of correct responses. We also experimented with the development of a token board using PowerPoint, where tokens were exchanged for minutes of access to YouTube videos that the participant could control using the bidirectional Zoom interface. At the second site, implementers used the Premack principle by introducing preferred PEAK programs contingent on the completion of LIFE tasks. The Relational Accelerator Program (RAP; Belisle & Burke, 2020) is downloadable software that allows for the gamification of PEAK programming that creates programs that resemble a game of Whac-a-Mole. For one learner, self-ratings of program enjoyment were high for the PEAK program developed using the RAP and moderate for the LIFE tasks that were deemed essential for achieving vocational goals. Progressing from the low-probability LIFE task to the high-probability PEAK task was efficacious for this learner in increasing attending and the willingness to complete both aspects of her PEAK programming remotely. A third solution used by the third site was embedding a motivative augmental (i.e., \"Values\") statement at the onset of LIFE training (e.g., asking the participant \"Why are we doing this today?\" to orient the participant to their previously stated value of getting a job in the community). This was effective in reducing task refusal with young-adult learners undergoing LIFE programming in this study.",

All three sites experienced challenges related to ensuring that caregivers were implementing aspects of the programs with fidelity, as well as ensuring continued involvement of caregivers in programming. The second site involved parents directly by teaching them to conduct programs in person with their children; this presented several barriers. A first barrier was the inconsistent implementation of PEAK programs by parents. We anticipate that this may be a common barrier for readers who attempt this strategy. To encourage more consistent participation, the site staff scheduled weekly meetings with the parent implementers to discuss any barriers to implementation. Site staff believed this strategy would be effective by easing implementation barriers through joint problem solving with parents, as well as socially reinforcing the completion of PEAK programming and data collection with learners. Respondents reported that this solution was effective in promoting program compliance; however, several errors and challenges were reported by parents attempting to implement the programs. The second site made several modifications to the programming to reduce the probability of implementation errors. First, data collection was simplified so that parents only recorded whether responses were correct or incorrect (i.e., prompt levels were not recorded). Second, test trials were removed so that parents could provide praise and reinforcement following each trial. This reduced implementation errors that would occur when discriminating between training and testing items. Third, parents were not required to record the stimulus that was presented; rather, they were instructed to randomly select a new stimulus on each trial within PowerPoint. Finally, YouTube videos were delivered along with new programs modeling the correct implementation of the program as it was developed by the school personnel.",

Remote delivery of LIFE programming can allow for training to occur directly within the context where the skill is expected to occur. We experimented with using Google Meet to establish a unidirectional interface with participants.

            "text": "One challenge that this site experienced was that, in the school setting, the context must be adapted to allow for the behavior to occur consistent with the steps indicated in the task analysis. For example, if a step in a task analysis for cleaning windows involves retrieving the window cleaner from the cleaning cabinet, school personnel must ensure that a full cleaning bottle is located in a specific cabinet within the classroom prior to delivering the instruction for the learner to complete the task. In the home setting, however, where the field test took place, caregivers may be less willing to adapt their context to fit the steps identified within the task analysis. In addition, events such as an empty bottle are not as easily predicted in real-world locations. The site staff solved this problem in two ways. First, following the development of the task analysis, the site staff met with the caregiver to discuss each step and its applicability to the home context. Items that were not applicable were adapted or removed to ensure that the steps fit within the context where the behavior was expected to occur. Second, the data collection sheet typically contained the columns \"correct\" and \"incorrect\" with the option to record the type of prompt that was used to evoke the step in the chain. The site added a third option, \"contextually appropriate,\" to the data collection sheet to indicate that if an item could not be successfully completed (e.g., empty cleaning bottle), the learner engaged in an appropriate solution to that event (e.g., asking the caregiver to fill the bottle). This also allowed the implementer to prompt a contextually appropriate response (e.g., \"Try asking your mother for help filling the container\") in the moment rather than adhering strictly to the written step within the task analysis. We also experimented with embedding visual prompts directly within the home context. For example, two learners were given programs that involved the use of three different cleaning agents to complete three cleaning tasks (cleaning windows, tables, and fridges). An antecedent intervention involved placing pictured labels on each of the cleaning agents corresponding with their use (e.g., placing the word \"WINDOWS\" on the window cleaning agent and \"TABLE\" on the table cleaning agent). The respondents reported that this was effective in promoting the successful selection of the correct cleaning agent contingent on the cleaning task. Both of these examples again involve strategies that are already supported in the behavioranalytic literature that require a degree of adaptation to ensure success within remote program delivery.",

Many single-case experimental designs can be implemented to determine whether this delivery format is efficacious in promoting greater attending or orienting to programs, engagement, and potential reductions of challenging behavior in sessions. Developing computerized programming may be necessary when in-person delivery is not desirable or possible, such as when transferring training to new locations or due to school shutdowns. We were able to field-test these programs because of statewide school shutdowns due to the COVID-19 pandemic, prompting the development of these remote-delivery systems. The procedures described here can be used to establish unidirectional and bidirectional interfaces using commercially available software. In all of the aforementioned procedures, we attempted to develop strategies that were largely customizable and adaptable.",

Not only can implementers change or alter the stimuli or arrays within programming, but unique slide transitions and embedding of videos and audio files can further allow for a user experience that is distinct and more advanced than programming with the paper stimuli that are commonly associated with discrete-trial programming. Every step described in the task analyses and each solution developed within our field test of these procedures are amenable to research designed to improve computerization and remote delivery of PEAK programming. For example, new prompting procedures such as gradually fading the translucency of distractor stimuli using a PowerPoint slide could be used as an adaptation to traditional stimulus-fading procedures either in person or remotely (Cummings & Saunders, 2019) . Embedding videos to accompany LIFE task analysis step prompts could also be included, where the learner has the option to play the video to complete the step but may earn fewer points in doing so (i.e., reinforcing independent completion). These are just two examples of a myriad of research studies that are open to investigation corresponding with behavioranalytic researchers' willingness as a field to adopt new technologies in their programming. In addition, direct testing of the development and use of these tools by individuals implementing behavior-analytic training programs could extend considerably the anecdotal field report provided in this technical article. Doing so could also allow for the direct comparison of this strategy with alternative strategies that are still under development, allowing for an increasingly inductive approach to technological development. Our hope is that this article serves as a resource for implementers to start on this journey, to allow teachers and therapists to respond to this and future pandemics, and to move programming outside of the walls of the classroom or therapy room and into the world where behavior analysts seek to affect the most change in the lives of their learners.",
