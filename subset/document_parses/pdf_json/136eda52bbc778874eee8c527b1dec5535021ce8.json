The use of HCQ/AZT in the outpatient setting seems more favorable than among inpatients. A small open-label non-randomized trial showed that HCQ use was significantly associated with viral load reduction, which was further enhanced by AZT use [14] . A prospective, outpatient observational non-peer reviewed study found that hospitalization rates dropped from 5.4% to 1.9% upon HCQ use, with hospitalization rates being lower if HCQ was used before day 7 post-symptom onset [15] . A nonsignificant reduction in symptom severity or new onset of illness 14 days was seen in two blinded, placebo-controlled trials that used HCQ within 4 days after exposure [16, 17] . Another trial used HCQ within 5-days of symptom duration. This trial found a non-significant 25% reduction in hospitalization rates and a 2-day reduction in time to symptom resolution [18]. A recent case series showed that outpatient low dose use of HCQ combined with AZT and Zn significantly reduced hospitalization rates when compared to untreated controls [19]. A systematic review reported that in studies where HCQ was given early on in the disease course and in the outpatient setting, there was consistent improvement trends in time to symptom resolution and improvement of the hospitalization rates.

The use of HCQ/AZT in the outpatient setting seems more favorable than among inpatients. A small open-label non-randomized trial showed that HCQ use was significantly associated with viral load reduction, which was further enhanced by AZT use [14] . A prospective, outpatient observational non-peer reviewed study found that hospitalization rates dropped from 5.4% to 1.9% upon HCQ use, with hospitalization rates being lower if HCQ was used before day 7 post-symptom onset [15] . A nonsignificant reduction in symptom severity or new onset of illness 14 days was seen in two blinded, placebo-controlled trials that used HCQ within 4 days after exposure [16, 17] . Another trial used HCQ within 5-days of symptom duration. This trial found a non-significant 25% reduction in hospitalization rates and a 2-day reduction in time to symptom resolution [18] . A recent case series showed that outpatient low dose use of HCQ combined with AZT and Zn significantly reduced hospitalization rates when compared to untreated controls [19] . A systematic review reported that in studies where HCQ was given early on in the disease course and in the outpatient setting, there was consistent improvement trends in time to symptom resolution and improvement of the hospitalization rates. When HCQ was given on the first 48 h of admission, 67% of studies showed a positive outcome in the HCQ group. When it was used after 48 h, only 40% of studies found HCQ to provide clinical benefit [20] .",

Importantly, reductions in IL-6, troponins and mortality among hospitalized patients with heart disease receiving HCQ has also been reported [26] . It would be of interest to evaluate these effects in non-O ABO groups, who are at increased risk of cardiac injury and mortality compared to other groups [27] .

During SARS-CoV-2 infection, Orf6 binds to the nuclear membrane importin IMP\u03b1/\u03b21, which then translocates to the nuclei, antagonizing the antiviral activity of the transcription factor STAT1. Ivermectin efficiently blocks this transport through the nuclear pore complex; no cellular toxicity was identified in vitro [42] . In a retrospective cohort study (ICON study), use of 200 \u03bcg/kg ivermectin on admission was associated with approximately 50% reduction in an all-cause in-hospital mortality rate among patients with severe COVID-19 disease. No signs of toxicity were associated with ivermectin use [43] . A recent trial that evaluated ivermectin+doxycycline vs pla-cebo+standard care, found clinical improvement on day 7 in 60.7% of patients compared to 44.4% in the control. By day 12, only 23% of ivermectin-users had not shown clinical improvement, compared to 37.2% in the control group. A trial has been registered to further investigate the utility of this drug (NCT04523831) [44] .",

            "text": "HMGB1 is an endogenous damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP) and DNA-RNA-binder involved in the host response to COVID-19. It is a potent ligand of TLR4, which can be released extracellularly from dying or activated innate cells. Extracellular HMGB1 can access neighboring cells and activate intracellular inflammatory receptors [45] . The receptor for advanced glycation endproducts (RAGE) and TLR4 constitute the main receptors for HMGB1, the former found primarily in alveolar tissue. Development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) directly correlates with plasma HMGB1 levels. In this regard, serum levels of HMGB1 are directly involved with specific patterns of cytokine storm in COVID-19, severity of lung injury, d-dimer levels, organ damage, neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio, prediction of ICU stay, and survival [46] . Although specific HMGB1 antagonists are not yet available, lysosome alkalinization with CQ inhibits HMGB1mediated lysosomal membrane detergent lysis. CQ also decreases the systemic release of HMGB1 during sepsis [47] . Ivermectin blocks LPS-mediated cytokine release, which takes place primarily through TLR4 blockade. This suggests that ivermectin may also block HMGB1-mediated TLR4 activation. Ivermectin also possibly downregulates TLR4 expression [48, 49] . On the other hand, ivermectin administration has been associated to HMGB1 release [50] .",

Anakinra directly involves the blockade of IL-1b and NLRP3 as consequence of downregulation in the mevalonate pathway (MVP). (Right) Statins and bisphosphonates block specific enzymes of the MVP, reducing its downstream activity and modulating immune response.
