The recommended commodities to be developed in Indonesia are corn, soybean, mungbean, peanut, and rice that are produced with advanced technology and input-output coefficient. There are five introduced scenarios namely, basic scenario, I, II, III, and IV. There are problems related to resource allocation such as limited resources, the ways of using it, and time constraints. In order to maintain and improve the comparative advantage of agricultural production as well as to broaden the agricultural activities, agricultural development is directed to increase business efficiency, improvements in agricultural science, technology, and human resource quality. The utilization of agricultural land resources should be well-planned for better development.",

            "text": "Nowadays, income inequality in provinces across Indonesia still becomes a problem. The income in urban areas is indeed different from the earnings made in rural areas. The economic development in rural areas is highly dependent upon the agricultural sector, especially the utilization and use of agricultural land (Haryanto et al., 2019; Ruel et al., 2018) . In line with the program to increase farmers' incomes, particularly in the provinces with narrow land are carried out continuously. On the other hand, the farmers with limited land try to improve their production whilst being concerned about the land conservation area in order to maintain its productivity Pishgar-Komleh et al., 2013) . The challenges for Indonesian farmers are as they don't know how to develop the land to boost production, maintain and preserve resources, and increase their income and well-being (Herrero et al., 2017; Jat et al., 2019; Jat et al., 2013; Nasikh, 2016; Yoga et al., 2018) . This is not worsened by the coronavirus pandemic. The current pandemic began in December 2019 and declared as an international pandemic in April 2020. The agricultural sector has not been always affected by the coronavirus. Limited land with low productivity becomes the new problem that should be solved. There are many efforts should be implemented to improve agricultural products in the limited land that requires a proper farming system (Haryanto et al., 2019) whereas (Herforth et al., 2016; Saad et al., 2016) emphasizes there is a need to conserve the land. Land conservation becomes the new alternative to improve the agricultural product in the middle of coronavirus pandemic (Roe et al., 2020; Waibel et al., 2020; Elleby et al., 2020; Mukhamedjanova, 2020; Zhang et al., 2020; Gregorio and Ancog, 2020; Verikios, 2020; Bartik et al., 2020; Beland et al., 2020) .",

It was first conducted to develop the food crop commodity as the leading agricultural commodity in four provinces that analyzes two aspects, namely the agricultural aspect (agricultural land area with five scenario areas) and the economic aspect (the employment rate, income, capital, food consumption needs, and comparative advantage). They are analyzed in an integrated manner to obtain the prioritized alternative that is most beneficial for the farmers and the agricultural agency at the provincial level. This research contributes to the development of food crop commodity farming in Indonesia by using an analysis approach called the dual goal programming model. It offers three priority targets, namely farming income, job opportunity, and farming capital utilization with five available scenarios of choices (the basic scenario, scenario 1, scenario 2, scenario 3, and scenario 4). Furthermore, this research contributes to the farmers in terms of allowing them to choose the food crop commodity that gives high-income alternatives in four provinces (East Java, Central Java, West Nusa Tenggara, and South Sulawesi) and other provinces in Indonesia. In addition, this study also commits to the Food Crop Agricultural Agency of the Republic of Indonesia as the policymaker at the provincial level to develop the food crop commodity that can open higher job opportunities.",

In terms of production, it is also vulnerable because of three reasons: (i) the growth of rice highly depends on the sufficient water irrigation, whereas it is getting scarce, (ii) the rate of conversion from rice field to non-rice field become more uncontrollable, and (iii) the ability to expand the rice field (new construction) is very limited (Sellberg et al., 2020; Bhaduri et al., 2018; Miyinzi et al., 2019; M\u00fcller et al., 2020; Mulwa, & Visser, 2019 .",

Research finding by Purnono et al. (2019), Dewi (2018) , Miyinzi et al. (2019) , and Hadi et al. (2019) shows that the undeveloped food crop area reflects low incentives of the farmers to grow the food crop commodity. In the future, the regional development in the four provinces of East Java, Central Java, West Nusa Tenggara, and South Sulawesi is directed to be one of the national food barns by increasing productivity and added value of food crop agriculture as well as escalating and expanding the area of food crop. The regional development in the four provinces as the center of agricultural production and national food barn is done by applying strategies to increase the production and productivity of food crop and plantation. In order to develop the potential of food crop production as the national food barn, the regional development policy should be aware of other economic developments. Besides, the four provinces (East Java, Central Java, West Nusa Tenggara, and South Sulawesi) are the centers of staple food production, especially rice, corn, soybean, peanut, and mungbean. In those provinces, there is some unutilized agricultural land that is potential to increase the food crop productivity, so the policy of production improvement can be applied easily by the area expansion strategy.",

The initial formulation of the goal programming is basically similar to the linear programming formulation in which the decision variable should be defined in advance. After that, the objective of the raw materials should be specified according to its degree of significance. Next, solution to minimize the deviations is sought. In other words, the goal programming is an analysis tool to minimize the deviation of various objectives and targets that have been set, so the targets can be achieved according to each priority scale established for a particular method. It is even conflicted in the formulation process. Therefore, the goal programming method is used to solve problems which have multiple objectives. This method results in an efficient solution because the consequence cannot be optimal for all existing problems. The deviational variable works to accommodate the deviations that will occur on the left side of the equation. To minimize the deviation, the value on the left side of the equation is made as closest as possible to the value on the right side.",

In this case, the targets are expressed in the constant value on the right side, for example, the farmers' income, limited capital, and limited agricultural land. Thus, achieving a target means making effort to make the value on the left side of the equation equal to the right side. It is a reason why the constraint in the goal programming method is always in the form of the equation and they are called the target constraint. In addition, the target constraint is marked with deviational variables so that every target constraint must have a deviational variable. The goal programming modelling of the goal programming is the existence of deviational variable. The deviational variable can be distinguished to two types. First, the deviational variable accommodates the deviation under the desired target. The target is reflected on the right side of the target constraint. In other words, the deviational variable has a function to accommodate the negative deviation. The goal programming model has been widely applied in some decisionmaking situations, such as the agriculture and fish farming. The deviational variable works to accommodate the deviation that will occur on the left side of the equation towards the right side. The deviational variable is divided into two: (1) The deviational variable to accommodate the deviation occurring under the desired target (d \u00c0 i ); (2) The deviational variable to accommodate the deviation occurring above the desired target (d \u00fe i \u00de Basically, the framework of LGP method of agricultural land allocation for food crop is an attempt to minimize the deviation of some sets of agricultural land allocation for food crop established by the decision maker. Every deviation of the modifiers in the objective function is represented to the positive (p) and negative (n) deviation values of every objective. Therefore, the algorithm of agricultural land allocation for food crop has a purpose to minimize the deviation, especially if related to the priorities or interests relative to the decision maker.",

In regards to these problems, the optimization function of food crop commodity should be developed with the limited productive land, low farming capital, and insignificant numbers of job opportunities in the agricultural sector.

The location was selected purposively based on the potential to produce the food crop commodity. It was conducted in April 2019 to June 2020. Types of data used in this study were primary and secondary data that were quantitative and qualitative. The primary data were obtained from the direct interview with farmers of the food crop commodity (in 2019 before the Covid-19 pandemic). The secondary data were taken from the associated departments, namely the Central Bureau of Statistics, Regional Development Planning Agency, and Economic Agency in each regency. The respondents were the farmers who used their land to produce the food crop commodity.",

They were the section chief of food crop and horticulture business developments, and coordinator of Technical Implementing Unit of the Agricultural and Agricultural Extension Offices. The snowball sampling was conducted among farmers, namely the head of farmer group and the farmers. The decision to choose the key people was a perception of those who understood about the research problem. Scoring criteria and alternatives in this study were done by the key people. Consequently, experts' opinions should be checked for their consistency. The rational opinions were combined by using a geometric average to avoid bias. The key people in this study were the related stakeholders (experts of Department of Agriculture and Department of Food Crop) who played roles in the food crop development in each province. They included a section chief of food crop and horticulture business developments, a coordinator of Technical Implementing Unit of the Agricultural Offices, three agricultural extension staffs, three heads of farmer groups, and thirty-seven farmers.

This study established five scenarios such as basic scenario, I, II, III, and IV. The basic scenario emphasizes physical and economic conditions, where there is a constraint that limits the development: the land area to grow the rice is only one-third of the total agricultural area in each province. Therefore, the suggested commodity is as follows; (i) East Java province: corn (214.15 thousand hectares), peanut (718.75 thousand hectares), and rice (285.9 thousand hectares); (ii) South Sulawesi province: corn (85.35 thousand hectares), and rice (341.78 thousand hectares); (iii)West Nusa Tenggara province: corn (73.74 thousand hectares), peanut (288.12 thousand hectares), and rice (218.12 thousand hectares); and (iv) Central Java province: soybean (290.11 thousand hectares), and mungbean (1,273.23 thousand hectares).",
