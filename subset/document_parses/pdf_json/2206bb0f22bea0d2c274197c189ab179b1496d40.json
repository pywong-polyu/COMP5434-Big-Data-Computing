In previous analyses of SECURE-IBD, corticosteroids were associated with an increased risk of severe COVID-19, defined as ICU admission, invasive ventilation, or death. 6 7 In addition, compared to anti-tumour necrosis factor-\u03b1 (anti-TNF) monotherapy, thiopurine monotherapy, thiopurine plus anti-TNF, and 5-aminosalicylates (5ASA)/sulfasalazine were independently associated with worse outcomes. 6 In addition to medication-related effects, IBD patients may have worse COVID-19 outcomes as a result of gastrointestinal inflammation, potentially related to the mucosal expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) in the gastrointestinal tract. 8 This hypothesis invokes the potential role of gut inflammation and IBD activity as a mediator of COVID-19 severity. In an earlier SECURE-IBD analysis including 525 patients, clinically active disease was significantly associated with an increased risk of the composite outcome of hospitalization or death, and there was a trend toward an increased risk of ICU admission, ventilation, or death. 7 A more recent study from the United Kingdom, however, found no increased risk of poor COVID-19 outcomes in patients with acute severe ulcerative colitis. 9 As the relationship between IBD activity and COVID-19 severity remains unclear, we evaluated the impact of IBD clinical disease activity on COVID-19 outcomes, while accounting for the confounding effects of medications and other factors. We specifically explored the modifying effect of age on the association between IBD activity and COVID-19 severity.",

Healthcare providers were instructed to report cases regardless of severity, after a minimum disease duration of seven days and after sufficient time had elapsed to determine the final illness outcome (resolution or death).

The A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t 10 exposure of interest was clinical IBD activity, measured by PGA. PGA was analysed as a three-level variable, combining clinical remission and mild PGA into a single reference category, against which moderate PGA and severe PGA were compared. We examined the following covariates: age, sex, comorbidities (defined as none, 1 or \u22652), IBD type (defined as UC/IBD-unclassified or CD), systemic corticosteroids (defined as intravenous or oral corticosteroids, excluding local release formulations like ileal-release budesonide), anti-TNF monotherapy (defined as anti-TNF without a thiopurine or methotrexate), anti-TNF combination therapy (defined as anti-TNF plus an immunomodulator [thiopurine or methotrexate]), immunomodulator monotherapy (defined as a thiopurine or methotrexate without anti-TNF), 5ASA/mesalamine, race/ethnicity (defined as Hispanic, non-Hispanic White, non-Hispanic Black, non-Hispanic Asian and other/mixed), body mass index (BMI), country gross domestic product (GDP), and other medications (anti-integrins, ustekinumab). Recognizing that, over time, changes have occurred in COVID-19 management and variants (both with implications on outcomes), we also adjusted for period of COVID-19 diagnosis. For analyses, we dichotomized COVID-19 diagnosis period, using Joinpoint regression (https://surveillance.cancer.gov/joinpoint/, V.4.8.0.1) to identify the inflection month at which outcome rates changed significantly. This month was found to be November 2020 (Supplemental Figure 1 ). We therefore defined two COVID-19 diagnosis periods, March 2020 to October 2020, and November 2020 to July 2021 (including those diagnosed August 1-3, 2021). Variables with >10% missing data were excluded from primary analyses, but we explored their effects in sensitivity analyses.",

In an analysis of 209 paediatric IBD patients from the SECURE-IBD registry, moderate/severe clinical activity was associated with an increased risk of hospitalization, 12 but the small sample size precluded adjustment for confounding variables, and outcomes such as ICU admission and death were too few to examine. In a prospective Italian study of 79 IBD patients with SARS-CoV-2, clinical IBD activity was identified as a risk factor for COVID-19 pneumonia and death. 13 Again, multivariable analyses could not be performed due to small sample size. In a Danish nationwide IBD cohort study, amongst 76 patients with COVID-19, no independent association was observed between clinical or biochemical IBD activity and the outcomes of hospitalization, ICU admission, ventilation, or death. 14 Important differences with our study include the much smaller sample size and definition of active IBD as any degree of activity (including mild). A longitudinal cohort study of 119 IBD patients from New York found that those with active IBD (clinically, endoscopically or biochemically) and those receiving corticosteroids were more likely to be infected with COVID-19, though without explicit comment on the link between IBD activity and severity A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t 17 of the infection. 15 Beyond IBD, there is a robust body of literature supporting that poor control of other chronic diseases, such as diabetes mellitus, confers an increased risk of severe COVID-19. 16 Our findings suggest that active IBD may be a particularly important modifiable risk factor for severe COVID-19 in younger patients. This may be because, in older patients, factors such as age, comorbidities and medications are primary drivers of risk, whereas in younger patients, disease activity plays a more prominent role. Differential practices by age for COVID-19 testing (possibly less testing of younger patients with mild disease) and shielding practices (possibly greater protective practices in older individuals) may also be relevant.",

Firstly, ACE2, the primary SARS-CoV-2 receptor is widely expressed at the luminal surface of the gastrointestinal tract. 8 17 Transcriptomic analyses of intestinal biopsies demonstrate that inflammation influences ACE2 gene expression in a location-specific manner. [18] [19] [20] The role of ACE2 in modulating COVID-19 progression is not entirely clear; although higher expression increases viral uptake by the host, ACE2 has important anti-inflammatory properties, which may help prevent the secondary \"cytokine storm\" in severe COVID-19. 20 The effect of gut inflammation on ACE2 expression represents an important putative mechanism by which IBD activity may influence COVID-19 outcomes. Network analyses show that IBD and COVID-19 pathways intersect molecularly and share several \"key driver genes.\" 18 In addition, in severe COVID-19, thromboembolic complications are a major driver of significant morbidity and mortality. [21] [22] [23] [24] Active IBD, especially moderate-severe exacerbations requiring hospitalization, is an established risk factor for venous thromboembolism, 25 26 and could potentially confer an incremental risk of thromboembolic complications in the setting of COVID-19, although this has yet to be demonstrated. Lastly, active IBD may be associated with poorer general health, which may place A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t 18 individuals at increased risk of adverse COVID-19 outcomes. Notably, the association between IBD activity and more severe viral infection is not unique to COVID-19; IBD disease activity is an established risk factor for viral replication and worse outcomes with other viruses such as EBV and CMV, 27 28 though it is difficult to disentangle the effects of chronic inflammation from immunosuppressive treatment.",

Secondly, patients with moderately to severely active IBD should be counselled to adhere to practices that minimize their risk of contracting COVID-19 (such as staying home from school and/or work), given their risk of worse outcomes if they become infected. This is particularly applicable to younger patients, based on our findings. Our observations may also have implications for vaccine prioritization. Recent evidence suggests that IBD patients on anti-TNF have attenuated serological responses to SARS-CoV2 vaccines and that, accordingly, delayed second dosing should be avoided in such patients. 31 Our results suggest that younger patients with severe IBD may warrant vaccine prioritization as well, including adherence to the recommended interval between vaccine doses. Along the same lines, our findings may also have implications for vaccine booster doses in the IBD population.",

In addition, the timing of PGA assessment may not have been precisely contemporaneous with COVID-19 diagnosis. Lastly, COVID-19related gastrointestinal symptoms may have influenced PGA assessment. While these are important limitations, there are several elements that appear to lend face validity to our findings. Firstly, although there is likely variability in how PGA was applied, we explored the effect of using a different method to categorize PGA (remission or mild vs. moderate or severe) and found similar results. Secondly, we generally observed a gradient effect, whereby severe PGA was associated with greater magnitudes of effect than moderate PGA. Although the PGA remains a subjective clinical assessment, it has been the reference standard in developing numerous indices, 32 33 in both CD and UC, and its use is commonplace in clinical practice.

IBD activity remained independently associated with hospitalization (moderate PGA: aOR 1.48, 95% CI 1.23-1.79; severe PGA: aOR 3.24, 95% CI 2.34-4.50). However, the association between IBD activity and ICU/ventilation/death was lost after adjusting for the covariates shown. Covariates associated with increased risk of both adverse outcomes included diagnosis earlier in the pandemic (March to October 2020), older age, comorbidities, and systemic corticosteroids, while anti-TNF monotherapy was protective. Male sex was associated with an increased risk of hospitalization. A sensitivity analysis including BMI for the outcome of ICU/ventilation/death yielded almost identical PGA effect estimates (moderate PGA: aOR 1.20, 95% CI 0.84-1.73; severe PGA: aOR 1.46, 95% CI 0.73-2.92).",
