In the UK, an unforeseen acute stage was followed by temporary easing of restrictions, prior to the introduction of staged tiers as the number of regional positive cases crept up to critical levels. At the point of writing, multiple coronavirus vaccines have received authorisation worldwide. However, precautions remain in place as the mass vaccination programme will take a significant length of time to complete, and the efficacy of vaccines against all variants is unknown. The majority of COVID-19 cases are asymptomatic or mild enough to be treated at home. However, the World Health Organisation (WHO) states that approximately 5% of confirmed cases are severe enough to require robust treatment strategies and intensive care. 2 The main causes of mortality include respiratory distress syndrome, organ failure, septic shock and severe pneumonia. 2 The acute phase was characterised by a period of rapid learning and adaption by all work sectors, but particularly healthcare organisations who were required to identify, treat, and reduce risk for patients at risk of COVID-19. 3 Guidance on infection control and personal protective equipment (PPE) was provided internationally 4 and reflected at country level, such as that relevant to organisations in England 5 However, messages changed regularly in line with developing scientific knowledge. Concerns around advice and availability of PPE for UK healthcare workers during the acute phase were also well documented. [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] Imaging has played a critical role in the diagnostic pathway of COVID-19. 12 Evidence-based guidance on the use of imaging has been provided throughout the pandemic with chest X-rays recommended as a primary tool for diagnosis and follow-up of coronavirus pneumonia progression, alongside polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing. 13, 14 Chest X-rays have the versatility of being performed outside of the imaging department at the patient bedside but required carefully devised local standard operating procedures. 13 Although, Computed Tomography (CT) is an accurate and well-accepted test for patients with severe respiratory distress, it was advocated that CT was not performed as a screening tool but reserved for moderate to severe features of COVID-19 6 based on monitoring progression 15 and potential for acute thromboembolic disease 16 . Cases would need risk/ benefit analysis by clinicians and radiologist authorisation 15 as CT scanning requires the patient to attend the imaging department. Patient transfer to CT in these cases is often complex and resource intensive and requires carefully coordinated decontamination of CT facilities following COVID-19 positive cases.",

            "text": "The impact of the pandemic on diagnostic imaging departments has been extensive. The emergency has demanded that modalities establish additional capacity and processes for COVID-19 related inpatient workload, including the segregation of patients considered to be WHO classified as probable, suspected, or confirmed, 3 from those considered to be at low risk of having the infection. Within their means, imaging departments have also attempted to pragmatically maintain safe, clinically essential non-COVID-19 services, and more recently to restore elective outpatient capacity to pre-pandemic levels. It is acknowledged that throughout the pandemic asymptomatic, but COVID-19 positive, patients may be attending imaging departments for a diagnostic workup of different pathologies; therefore, the necessary precautions may not have been undertaken. 12 The purpose of this study was to investigate the changes that have been made by the CT department within diagnostic imaging and their impacts on service delivery, working practices and decision-making role among diagnostic radiographers. The aim was to ascertain the types of scans accepted during the pandemic, whether departments were using dedicated COVID-19 scanners, and if they could ensure social distancing during care. The working practices surveyed related to radiographer PPE for high-risk versus low-risk COVID-19 cases, and provision of facemasks for patients. Based on the risk of community transmission by asymptomatic patients, we asked radiographers if they review outpatient CT images for signs of COVID-19 pneumonia. We sought to understand their decision making and autonomy within patient pathways as well as the underpinning training provided to support independent practice. Diagnostic radiographers have been steered by a range of learning opportunities 17 and research 12,18 on the characteristic imaging appearances of this new pathology. However, there are wider aspects of clinical governance, the duty of care to patients and education still to be learned from the experiences of radiographers in preparation for future pandemics.",

The questionnaire consisted of 16 questions in 6 sections utilising a combination of fixed response, free text, and scenarios to explore role expectations within the three main aspects of service delivery, working practices and decision-making of radiographers (survey questions are available from the corresponding author). Specific areas of interest were social distancing, patient scheduling and departmental organisation; PPE routines for different clinical situations and mandatory facemasks for patients; and the review and management of asymptomatic patients. Additionally, radiographers were given the opportunity to provide their personal views and experiences of the pandemic through free text comments. Respondents were asked to provide their geographical location to identify their distribution, however this was the only identifiable information collected. All responses were treated confidentially. Participant information was provided on the first page of the survey with contact details provided for comments or questions, including those related to eligibility to participate. Ethical approval for this study was obtained prior to study commencement (EC26228).",

At the time of the survey, the COVID-19 pandemic was expected to be of high salience to respondents and facts were expected to be well remembered. The questionnaire was also piloted with radiographers prior to distribution for question wording, coherence, and usability of the survey platform. Modifications were made in line with suggestions to minimise response bias. The survey was opened for 6 weeks between 29 June 2020 and 16 Aug 2020. Using snowball sampling, the link to the online survey was promoted through global networks, professional special interest groups, and social media. As this was a personal invitation, respondents were asked to share survey details with CT colleagues both within their own department and at other institutions to avoid selection bias. The survey was not limited to UK-practicing radiographers and as such was open to respondents from any geographical region, although advertisement in the international context was predominately limited to social media. A number of updates and reminders to participate were posted on social media to maximise response. Upon survey closure, all electronic repose data was exported into Microsoft Excel\uf0e2 (Microsoft Corporation, USA) for data validation and analysis. Descriptive and textual analysis, which represent the perspectives and experiences, have been reported. Statistical analysis was undertaken using social science statistics (https://www.socscistatistics.com/) including Chi-squared test of association between variables. In hypothesis testing (that the variables are independent), a p-value 0.05 has been considered significant and 0.01 highly significant.",

Daily increases in the number of positive cases, hospital admissions and death toll are reported worldwide, and widespread disruption ensues as healthcare organisations adapt to, and try to navigate the \"new normal.\" The United States of America (USA) has been worst affected, reporting the highest number of cases and deaths among all nations to date, 1, 19 followed by Asia, Europe (including the UK), and Africa. Oceania has reported the least number of deaths at 1,290 as of April 15, 2021. 1 Survey responses were received from the above areas except for Asia although, the large majority of respondents (and resultant data) were UK centric. All respondents to the survey were radiographers delivering CT services during the pandemic within either public hospitals, private clinics or mobile provision. Variation in demand and workload were seen between small hospital clinics who had scanned very few, to no, COVID-19 positive patients, and larger public hospitals who were imaging an array of trauma, acutely unwell and emergency inpatients as well as CT outpatients on urgent, time critical and cancer pathways. The clinical practices, COVID-related workload, and access to PPE communicated by the survey respondents appeared to reflect international statistics for community transmission. 1, 20 A RT-PCR test is considered the gold standard diagnostic investigation for COVID-19, 21 however, owing to issues around result turnaround times, and multiple false negative results, imaging studies such as Xray and CT have been integral to patient triage throughout the pandemic. 22 The survey highlighted differences in the utilisation of CT between organisations. International guidelines [13] [14] [15] 20, [23] [24] [25] have been clear that owing to poor sensitivity in asymptomatic patients and early stages of the virus, CT should not be used as a first-line diagnostic tool or screening test. Due to the higher radiation burden and risks of transmission, CT should be used sparingly for hospitalised symptomatic patients with specific clinical indications. In line with UK guidance, 15 clinical decisions on the justification of CT procedures appear to have been made on a local level with some respondents indicating that CT had been reserved for those cases where infection status had been confirmed and a consultant level discussion had highlighted a clear clinical management need. Whilst others described wide CT utilisation based on standard criteria which had increased workload and pressure on the service and staff.",

The majority of guidelines are clear for acute emergency inpatients, suggesting that equipment and staff should be protected from possible infection through testing and risk assessment. 20 However, the recommendations, and organisational level processes are less clear for asymptomatic non-hospitalised patients despite the recognised risk of unintentional transmission by those with a false negative RT-PCT or chest X-ray, or those who have not been tested prior to their elective appointment. 2, 18, 22 Global studies, [26] [27] [28] [29] have demonstrated that during lockdowns diagnostic imaging departments experienced a reduction in activity, either through a documented fear of the public to access healthcare services during the pandemic, 26 or a decision to defer non-urgent outpatients 26 and re-focus resources on COVID-19 related activities. 27 This has been highlighted as an unprecedented move by diagnostic imaging departments 28 made to allow for social distancing of hospital visitors, cleaning between appointments and to protect staff. 29 The survey demonstrated that regardless of region, CT departments had reduced capacity for non-urgent outpatient procedures at the start of the pandemic when departments were first reacting to the emergency. However, a large majority of respondents emphasised that initial limitations were either not followed or quickly relaxed. This may be due to different perceptions of what is classed as time-critical workload, concerns over significant backlogs and service recovery, financial implications, or fears of the adverse health outcomes in patients delaying care 26 particularly in chronic long-term conditions and oncology.",

Within the limitations of the survey, radiographers highlighted that some of their organisations had been able to establish recommendations for social distancing of patients and carers and provide a dedicated scanner for patients confirmed or suspected to have COVID-19. 13 However, approximately a third of those who responded to the survey were unable to avoid the mixing of workload. In some cases, this was due to only having one scanner on site, and radiographers had taken on the responsibilities of disinfecting the equipment and scan room to maintain throughput. It is well publicised that some diagnostic imaging services have been underfunded over previous years 30 and the COVID-19 pandemic has enforced the need to reassess equipment provision and constrained department designs, which in most cases will not have been updated for decades. This will be important moving forwards, particularly in areas such as CT, as services attempt to work through the backlog of patients whilst maintaining standard infection prevention and control precautions. 35 However, it has been warned that any capital investment must be supported by an increase in diagnostic imaging staff numbers, 31 who as confirmed by this, and other studies, 11, 33, [36] [37] [38] [39] are on the verge of burnout.",

However, the perceived minimal risk pathway of outpatients attending hospitals for planned diagnostic tests 35 can be problematic when CT images demonstrate unexpected indeterminate COVID-related changes. Although imaging findings are non-specific and may overlap with other infections, 40 there is a need for radiographers to review the image set, which may only include the lung bases. Recognising the features of acute or chronic COVID-19 infection, and escalating CT image appearances allows correlation with clinical presentation, history of contact and any recent travel. 40 The process can be facilitated by appropriate training of radiographers. The survey indicated a mixed response as to the provision of training on relevant CT image appearances and the subsequent autonomy to act and confidence in decision-making. Although, no radiographers had received formal education, in-house training provided by local radiologists had been well received. Unfortunately, a substantial proportion of radiographers indicated that they had been provided with little support in this area and were self-taught through online resources.",

As responses were anonymous, the only demographic information collected was their country of residence. Therefore, we are unable to say whether multiple responses were obtained from radiographers within the same organisation and whether this has resulted in an element of response bias. The information presented reflects individual's experiences at a point of time in the pandemic; it is unknown whether these are based on standard operating procedures established on an organisation or site level. Pathways for escalation and management of incidental COVID-19 related image changes were not requested; therefore, this information is limited.
