Within a short time, major populations around the world were grappling with the fear of this newly named coronavirus . This unprecedented global health crisis was declared as a global pandemic by the World Health Organization in March 2020. 1 The rapid spread of the virus along with its high infectivity and unknown pathogenicity caused extreme panic, chaos, and confusion. Even modern governments and elite healthcare facilities began witnessing the biggest healthcare, administrative and financial crisis of the century.",

            "text": "In Saudi Arabia, the pandemic was first detected in a Saudi traveler from Iran, who tested positive for COVID-19 on March 2, 2020. 2 Like other governments of the world, partial curfews and lockdowns were imposed by the Kingdom to limit the spread of pandemic. Only essential services were permitted to continue and only workers with permits were allowed to exit their homes. 3 As a result of this mandate, dental clinics and institutions had to close across Saudi Arabia, leaving only emergency services operational. Dental procedures carry a high risk of contamination and cross infection. Aerosols, saliva, blood, and respiratory droplets are potential routes of viral transmission. 4 Treating infected patients or coming in indirect contact with them through fallen droplets over surfaces can be a high-risk affair for a dental professional, their team, patients, and family members. 5 Hence, it was suggested by dental health organizations that only true dental emergencies should be attended to with infection control measures, while routine and elective dental treatment should be delayed. 6 Orthodontic treatment and esthetic procedures are not considered as medical emergencies. Hence, all orthodontic appointments were cancelled, and their treatment was delayed indefinitely. Orthodontic treatment is usually of long duration and requires multiple visits. Moreover, the treatment contributes to the esthetics, beauty, and mental body image of the patient. Therefore, the treatment is sensitive to the delays caused by closed clinics and missed appointments. The unspecified nature of the pandemic and unknown duration of lockdowns make the scenario worse for an orthodontic patient. This has led to varying levels of mental distress and anxiety for patients who are unable to visit a clinic and continue their respective treatment. 7 The aim of this study was to evaluate the mental health status of patients undergoing orthodontic treatment during the COVID-19 pandemic in Saudi Arabia. Moreover, this study analyzed the anxiety levels and challenges faced by orthodontic patients and their perception towards treatment.",

Section four evaluated patients' mental health status using the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale. 8 In a previous study, the Arabic version of this scale showed highly acceptable validity and reliability, with Cronbach \u03b1 ranging from 0.81-0.88. 9 In this scale, 10 questions were used to assess patients' mental health in the past 4 weeks, with scores between 1 (none of the time) to 5 (all of the time). The total range of the score was from 10-50. A score of 10-19 was considered normal, and respondents were considered likely to be well.

Unfortunately, 22% of orthodontists did not call or message their patients during lockdown. Such patients were found to be more anxious and in distress regarding their treatment. This is concerning, as inquiring about the progress of their treatment and assessing the overall condition of the patient is the primary responsibility of the orthodontist and their team. Reassuring the patient about what could happen and what will not happen can be a potential tool to motivate the patient and alleviate their fears regarding the treatment. 12 The concept of tele-orthodontics can be employed specifically during this period to digitally monitor the patients without having to visit the clinic in person. 13,14 A short call or message from the orthodontist or their office could help boost the confidence of the patient and provide some comfort. Recent studies have found that tele-monitoring and remote monitoring are positive approaches to evaluate the orthodontic health status of the patient in this pandemic era. 15, 16 The use of smartphones and digital technology can be useful in evaluating the progression of the treatment and improving the patient's cooperation. 17 Due to the current pandemic, 63% of the patients could not visit their orthodontist for the last 3-6 months. Despite this long period, a good number (63%) of patients regularly followed the instructions given by their orthodontist. Patient compliance can be a major problem in orthodontics because a failure to maintain good oral hygiene can lead to other deleterious effects on enamel and periodontium. 18 Long periods without checkups can lead to many problems that were otherwise solved easily in the pre-pandemic era.

Using a nail clipper to cut the distal ends of the wire, applying relief wax to secure a loose bracket or band, using various mouthwashes for bleeding gums, applying gels to ulcers, and taking painkillers were some of the measures reported by patients to remedy these problems. 12, 22 Virtual support through audio-visual interactions is an inexpensive and valuable method for providing information related to such emergency situations. 23 In this study, 95% of the patients reported that they would not have started the treatment if they knew the pandemic was coming. This negative response is significant and reflects the fear of COVID-19 amongst patients. Approximately ",

            "text": "72% of the patients were more worried about the lengthening duration of treatment than the cost of treatment increasing once the clinic opened. This might be justified on a case-by-case basis, but the orthodontic community should be compassionate towards this situation. Dental professionals have a moral duty to reduce the fear amongst their patients and their families but are concerned about the financial consequences of it. Additional costs arising from the use of standard infection control, sanitization measures, and personal protection equipment kits can be passed on to the patients. In this study, it was found that more than half (55%) of the patients were worried and 18% were very worried, as they were unable to continue their treatment. On the positive side, approximately 76% of the patients wished to visit their orthodontist once the lockdown ended, only if proper preventive measures were employed in the clinic. This finding is in accordance with previous studies where the majority of the patients were worried about not attending the clinic and their treatment time lengthening as a result. 7, 24 Orthodontic treatment is one of the lengthiest types of dental treatments, and each missed appointment can extend the treatment time by 1.09 months. 25 However, orthodontic procedures carry a low risk of infection, as aerosols are not generated. This can be considered as a strategic advantage, and patients can be reassured to resume their orthodontic treatment. Hence, the orthodontist should take certain precautionary steps, such as allowing only the patient into the operatory area, ensuring proper disinfection after each patient, reducing the number of patients in the waiting area, and undertaking a limited number of appointments per day. In addition, reassuring the patients about the safety of their clinic can increase patient satisfaction, confidence, and cooperation with the treatment. In this study, the majority of participants (58%) reported some level of mental distress owing to their treatment and the lockdown. A mild level of anxiety and psychological distress was found in the complete sample. Female patients were found to be more anxious than males, particularly females >25 years of age with more than one year into their orthodontic treatment. This finding is in accordance with results of other recent studies which have reported a higher level of anxiety and mental distress in female patients as compared with males. 7, 24, 26, 27 This can be attributed to the fact that females are more emotionally affected by difficult situations and hence report higher levels of stress and anxiety. 28 Moreover, their concern for finishing their treatment early, transportation problems during the pandemic, and other problems related to family, health, and finances can increase the burden on their mental well-being. Thus, it can be inferred that long durations of extended lockdown periods can accentuate the mental health problems for a number of patients. Additional measures to enhance the orthodontist-patient relationship are strongly recommended to relieve patients' levels of stress and anxiety.",
