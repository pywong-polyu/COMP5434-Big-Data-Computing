On March 16, the state's governor declared public health emergency in the city of Rio de Janeiro and partial lockdown measures came into force a week later. The main goal of this work is to discuss the impact of the measures on the air quality of the city by comparing the particulate matter, carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide and ozone concentrations determined during the partial lockdown with values obtained in the same period of 2019 and also with the weeks prior to the virus outbreak. Concentrations varied with substantial differences among pollutants and also among the three studied monitoring stations. CO levels showed the most significant reductions (30.3-48.5%) since they were related to light-duty vehicular emissions. NO 2 also showed reductions while PM 10 levels were only reduced in the first lockdown week. In April, an increase in vehicular flux and movement of people was observed mainly as a consequence of the lack of consensus about the importance and need of social distancing and lockdown. Ozone concentrations increased probably due to the decrease in nitrogen oxides level. When comparing with the same period of 2019, NO 2 and CO median values were 24.1-32.9 and 37.0-43.6% lower.

In general, primary pollutant concentrations showed a decrease in the first days of the lockdown. The differences observed between them can be explained considering the fleet characteristics in Rio de Janeiro. According to the last emission inventory for the MRRJ, mobile emissions account for 98, 67.3, 66.5 and 42.3% of total emissions of CO, HC, NO x and PM 10 , respectively (INEA, 2016) . Mean values for Brazil, estimated in the last national inventory of vehicular emission, showed that 47 and 46% of CO and NMHC, respectively, are emitted by light-duty vehicles (LDV). Motorcycles also contribute with a high fraction (34 and 25% of CO and NMHC). Heavy-duty vehicles (trucks and buses), fueled by diesel, contribute to 91 and 96% of NO x and particulate matter emitted by vehicular sources, respectively (NEI, 2014) . During the partial lockdown, trucks continue to run since industrial and construction activities were maintained as well as the transport of food and cargo in general. The fleet of buses was partially reduced while passengers' cars circulations had a 70-80% decrease in the first lockdown week (03/23-03/ 29) and then raised to approximately 50% (Fiocruz, 2020) . Then, a higher decrease in CO and NMHC should be expected, mainly for the period of 03/23/2020 to 03/29/2020, as will be discussed later. Ozone concentrations, the main secondary pollutant in Rio de Janeiro, markedly increased, mainly in Tijuca and Iraj\u00e1, as expected considering previous results obtained during a ten-day truck driver strike .

If data were compared with a longer period (02/16/2020-03/15/2020) the difference is still higher (approximately 25-30%) because of the heavy rains in February which led to lower particulate matter levels.

The increase in primary pollutant levels in Iraj\u00e1 and Tijuca can be attributed to the small reduction in the traffic and people circulation in the city.

These vehicles fueled with diesel are the main contributors to PM 10 and NO 2 . Urban buses circulation was only partially reduced (approximately 50%). Considering the last emission inventory for the MRRJ (INEA, 2016) emissions of PM 10 and NO 2 are mainly due to heavy-duty vehicles. Trucks contribute to 49.8 and 32.1% of PM 10 and NO 2 emissions, respectively, while urban buses account for 42.6 and 50.6%. The lower decrease for particulate matter levels in comparison to NO 2 is probably due to the highest contribution of trucks which continue circulating within the city.

Since NMHC/NO x ratios were approximately equal in the period of March 02-22, the increase in ozone concentrations was probably related to air masses entering from the northern industrial area. As recently discussed by Dantas et al. (2020) , the reactivity of the volatile organic compounds (VOC) mixture in Iraj\u00e1 is highly increased by industrial air masses rich in aromatic compounds (such as alkyl-substituted benzene and xylene isomers). During the fourth and fifth weeks, the sharp decrease in NO 2 concentrations (53.9 and 19.7%, respectively) lead to an increase in ozone, since atmospheric chemistry in Rio de Janeiro is under VOC-controlled conditions. In April, as previously discussed, the levels of all pollutants had a small variation due to the relaxation of social isolation measures.

The main restrictions were applied from March 23, however, in April, social isolation was relaxed in spite of the recommendations of WHO, scientist and medical experts and also state's governments. The partial confinement of the population, reduction of road traffic and economic activity led to the decrease in CO and NO 2 levels and, by contrast, to the increase in ozone concentrations. Similar results had been observed in 2018, during a 10-day truck driver strike. Since particulate matter and ozone are, in general, the pollutants of main concern in Rio the Janeiro, these results suggest that the assessment of air quality policies in the city requires the analysis of air masses transported from the industrial areas as well as the study of VOC speciation and the impact of NMHC/NO x ratios on ozone levels, considering that the high temperatures and solar radiation indexes favor ozone formation.
