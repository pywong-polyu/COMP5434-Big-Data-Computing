            "text": "Antigen detection provides particularly valuable information for medical diagnoses; however, the current detection methods are less sensitive and accurate than nucleic acid analysis. The combination of CRISPR/Cas12a and aptamers provides a new detection paradigm, but sensitive sensing and stable amplification in antigen detection remain challenging. Here, we present a PCR-free multiple trigger dsDNA tandem-based signal amplification strategy and a de novo designed dual aptamer synergistic sensing strategy. Integration of these two strategies endowed the CRISPR/Cas12a and aptamer-based method with ultra-sensitive, fast, and stable antigen detection. In a demonstration of this method, the limit of detection was at the single virus level (0.17 fM, approximately two copies/\u03bcL) in SARS-CoV-2 antigen nucleocapsid protein analysis of saliva or serum samples. The entire procedure required only 20 min. Given our system's simplicity and modular setup, we believe that it could be adapted reasonably easily for general applications in CRISPR/Cas12a-aptamer-based detection.",

            "text": "Antigens have been used as diagnostic hallmarks for many diseases, particularly infection with viruses, for example, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the cause of the current global coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic [1] . Many methods have been developed for SARS-CoV-2 detection through nucleic acids, antigens, and antibodies. Although PCR-based nucleic acid detection is the most accepted and reliable approach, it is relatively slow and device-dependent, owing to the requirements of RNA extraction and reverse transcription. In addition, RNA is less stable than protein (antigen) in laboratory conditions [2, 3] . Moreover, antibody-based tests work well only in late stages of infection, after patients have mounted immune responses, and therefore are not suitable for early diagnosis [4] [5] [6] . In comparison, antigen-based SARS-CoV-2 detection has several unique merits in COVID-19 diagnosis. Given its robustness and simplicity, it provides an important addition to the toolbox for SARS-CoV-2 detection [3, [7] [8] [9] . However, compared with mature nucleic acid detection approaches, recent state-of-the-art methods for SARS-CoV-2 antigen detection have some deficiencies in low abundance viral sample detection (e.g., early diagnosis) [3] . The underlying reason is that signal amplification of low amounts of antigen is not possible. In contrast, the amount of antibodies are already amplified in vivo after antigen stimulation, and nucleic acids can be amplified in vitro by PCR or LAMP (loop-mediated isothermal amplification) [10] , thus boosting both signals. To address the challenge of signal amplification for antigen detection, we endeavor to develop a novel antigen detection system with high sensitivity and excellent performance by amplifying the sensing signals.",

In a demonstration of this platform, we successfully identified two copies/\u03bcL SARS-CoV-2 in samples by using our newly established system of antigen detection; the LOD was comparable to that of the gold standard of PCRbased nucleic acid detection, but the detection was more rapid (~20 min) and the costs were lower.",

In this study, to couple antigen recognition with a CRISPR-based detection system, we used a specific aptamer (A48, with an equilibrium dissociation constant (K D ) of 0.49 nM) [27] of N protein as the recognition element to develop a SARS-CoV-2 antigen biosensor with our recently established CRISPR/Cas12a-based biosensing platform [15] . Our prototype was denoted the antigen biosensing platform CaT-Smelor-Covid. v1 (CRISPR/Cas12a and aptamer-mediated detector of diverse analytes for COVID-19, version 1). The working principle of CaT-Smelor-Covid. v1 is illustrated in Fig. 1a . In brief, a hybrid DNA (HyDNA) containing the Cas12a triggering dsDNA and a single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) complementary to parts of the aptamer A48 sequence was anchored to A48-coated magnetic beads (MB) (Fig. S1 ). SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein (Np), if present, interacts with A48 and releases the HyDNA. The released HyDNA then triggered Cas12a to cleave the fluorophore quencher (FQ)-labeled ssDNA probe, thus producing a readable fluorescence signal output.

S2 and S3), we found that the linear detection range of Np was 0.19-781 pM (R 2 > 0.99) (Fig. 1b, c, Fig. S4 ) with a LOD of 32 fM (approximately 193 copies/\u03bcL). For nucleic acid detection, the LOD of the gold-standard RT-qPCR and CRISPR-based methods reached up to one copy/\u03bcL of viral RNA [9] . Thus, this prototype did not meet the requirements for detection of SARS-CoV-2 in saliva samples or early diagnosis. Developing novel strategies for sensitive sensing and stable amplification is key for this CRISPR-based antigen detection paradigm.",

To increase or amplify the signal generated by the Cas12a triggering dsDNA, we designed a cluster of multiple triggering dsDNAs in tandem. Considering the trade-off between the S/N ratio and amplified signal, we kept the length of dsDNA below 600 bp, a length accommodating as many as 10 copies of the Cas12a triggering dsDNA with a 30 bp interval sequence (Fig. S5 ) [28] . Then the HyDNA containing different copy numbers (one to ten) of Cas12a triggering dsDNAs was anchored to A48-coated MB (Fig. S6) . The slopes of the fluorescence signal were proportional to one to ten copies of Cas12a triggering dsDNA (HyDNA10; Fig. 2c and d, Fig. S7 ). Thus, we constructed CaT-Smelor-Covid.v2 (version 2) by using HyDNA10 instead of HyDNA01 in the CaT-Smelor-Covid.v1 ( Fig. 2a and  b) . When detecting Np, we observed that the slope of the fluorescence intensity was linear (R 2 > 0.99), and the detection range was 6-381 fM (Fig. 2e, f, Fig. S8 ) with a LOD of 3.48 fM (approximately 42 copies/\u03bcL), thus indicating that the introduction of clustered multi-copy Cas12a triggering dsDNA indeed boosted the signal. With the introduction of a PCR-free signal amplification procedure, CaT-Smelor-Covid.v2 showed the expected characteristics of high stability and rapid detection. However, the LOD was inadequate for real-world detection in saliva samples or early diagnosis.",

When one aptamer binds the antigen and releases HyDNA, it promotes the response of the other aptamer to the same antigen and the release HyDNA due to proximity, thus producing a synergistic effect. Here, we introduced a biotin labeled Y-shaped DNA to simultaneously anchor the aptamer (A48) and another previously characterized aptamer (A61, K D = 2.74 nM) [27] on the MB. Then the two optimized HyDNA10 molecules (Fig. S9) were anchored on MB via interaction with aptamers A48 and A61. With CaT-Smelor-Covid.v3, we achieved excellent Np detection. Trace amounts of Np at concentrations of 0.19-2.98 fM were unambiguously and readily detected, with an LOD of 0.17 fM (Fig. 3c, d, Fig. S11 ). The LOD of SARS-CoV-2 was approximately two copies/\u03bcL, the lowest value reported to date for SARS-CoV-2 antigen detection through a CRISPR/Cas-based method [3, 19] . As expected, the response signal of CaT-Smelor-Covid.v3 allowed us to calculate a Hill coefficient of approximately 1.5, thus indicating positive cooperativity.",

As shown in Fig. 4a , as few as two copies/\u03bcL SARS-CoV-2 could be efficiently detected (P < 0.05). Moreover, the entire process required only approximately 20 min with a commercially available portable fluorescence detector (Qubit 4 Fluorometer, Thermo Fisher Scientific, US) (Fig. 5) . To demonstrate the performance of our method, we spiked saliva and human serum samples with different concentrations of inactivated SARS-CoV-2 for Np detection. In one single-blind test, 30 virus-spiked and 30 virus-unspiked saliva samples were detected with a Qubit 4 Fluorometer, and all positive samples were detected (P < 0.001; Fig. 4b, Figs . S13-S15).

Coupling with aptamers dramatically broadens the detection scope of CRISPR/Cas12a [15, 22] . However, how to stably amplify the signals sensed by aptamers and then translate the amplified signal into Cas12a cleavage activity has been an unresolved problem. Because of the lack of stable amplification of the signal sensed by the aptamer, this new detection paradigm has been unable to match the sensitivity of DETECTR and SHEROLOCK. Similarly, the sensitivity of Np antigen detection through the combination of CRISPR/Cas12a and aptamer in this study (LOD of 32 fM; ca. 193 copies/\u03bcL; Fig. 1, Fig. S4 ) was much lower than the nucleic acid detection systems DETECTR, SHEROLOCK, and STOPCovid, although the performance of CaT-Smelor-Covid.v1 was comparable to those of the previously reported immunology-based methods (186 viral copies/\u03bcL) [33] , Therefore, novel strategies were needed to dramatically enhance the sensitivity of this new detection paradigm. Furthermore, our results represent the general challenges of low sensing efficiency and detection sensitivity in the detection of target analytes through a combination of CRISPR/Cas12a and aptamers. Therefore, the main goal of this study was to address these problems and to provide a general solution for this detection paradigm.",

The use of these trigger dsDNAs significantly amplified the output fluorophore signal. Of note, when the trigger-dsDNA copy number was increased from one (HyDNA) to 10 (HyDNA10), the Fig. S10 . The data are the means and SD of three independent replicates. detection sensitivity also linearly increased approximately 10-fold (from 32 fM to 3.48 fM). Warranting the stabilized output signal and maximization of the S/N, we designed both the crRNA and trigger dsDNA sequences on the basis of the phage genome-derived prediction site [38] , which ensure optimal and robust performance of our CRISPR/Cas12a-based signal output system. In addition, the intersequence region between each trigger dsDNA was optimized. On the basis of our results, we believe that this well-characterized multiple trigger dsDNA tandem element could be used as a general tool in other CRISPR/Cas12a and aptamer-based detection systems, such as CaT-Smelor [38] , in applications beyond Np detection.",

            "text": "For most aptamers, the affinity toward the corresponding target is usually at the nanomolar level (i.e., dissociation constant, K D ), and further increasing the binding affinity by systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX) may be difficult [39] . However, the K D of the aptamer directly determines the sensing efficiency and consequently affects the detection sensitivity. Therefore, innovating the aptamer-based sensing module for a more sensitive response to antigen, independently of the affinity between aptamer and antigen, should be of general interest for all aptamer-based detection systems. In this study, we used a Y-shaped DNA and two aptamers, A48 and A61, recognizing different epitopes of the antigen, which were designed to sense the Np (Fig. 3) . A significant synergistic sensing effect was observed, in which the binding of A48 to Np facilitated the binding of A61 and Np, and vice versa. According the response curve, the Hill coefficient reached 1.52, thus indicating a positive synergistic effect between A48 and A61 [40] . By combining the multiple trigger dsDNA and synergistic sensing strategies, our system achieved an LOD for Np detection of 0.17 fM (Fig. S10) . Therefore, our dual aptamer synergistic sensing strategy, independently of binding affinity, not only increased the affinity limit of aptamers but also further improved the detection sensitivity (from 3.48 fM to 0.17 fM). Moreover, the synergistic effects could be applied to the detection of any other antigen with two aptamers that recognize different epitopes of the antigen. The output of the ssDNA cleavage activity of Cas12a can detected through many convenient methods, e.g., lateral-flow [41, 42] . Here, we used a commercially available portable fluorescence detector to demonstrate the merits and potential of our method in clinical diagnosis. Saliva and serum spiked with different concentrations of inactivated SARS-CoV-2 were used to mimic clinical samples, and the positive detection rate reached 100% (Fig. 4b) . Despite the limitations of the experimental conditions, and the absence of clinical trials, we believe that our results confirmed the practicability of our detection approach. In addition, compared with the existing antigen detection methods, our method had significant advantages in that the sensitivity was greatly improved, and the testing is fast in time-spent and low in cost ( Table 1) . The abovementioned advantages of CRISPR/Cas-based detection systems also extended to any antigen detection with our strategy.",

Integrating these two aspects, we achieved the first reported ultrasensitive, fast, stable, highperformance antigen detection using a CRISPR/Cas12a and aptamerbased detection paradigm.
