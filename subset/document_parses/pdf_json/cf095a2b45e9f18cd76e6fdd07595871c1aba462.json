            "text": "During the coronavirus disease-19 pandemic, the demand for specific medical equipment such as personal protective equipment has rapidly exceeded the available supply around the world. Specifically, simple medical equipment such as medical gloves, aprons, goggles, surgery masks, and medical face shields have become highly in demand in the health-care sector in the face of this rapidly developing pandemic. This difficult period strengthens the social solidarity to an extent parallel to the escalation of this pandemic. Education and government institutions, commercial and noncommercial organizations and individual homemakers have produced specific medical equipment by means of additive manufacturing (AM) technology, which is the fastest way to create a product, providing their support for urgent demands within the health-care services. Medical face shields have become a popular item to produce, and many design variations and prototypes have been forthcoming. Although AM technology can be used to produce several types of noncommercial equipment, this rapid manufacturing approach is limited by its longer production time as compared to conventional serial/mass production and the high demand. However, most of the individual designer/maker-based face shields are designed with little appreciation of clinical needs and nonergonomic. They also lack of professional product design and are not designed according to AM (Design for AM [DfAM]) principles. Consequently, the production time of up to 4 -5 h for some products of these designs is needed. Therefore, a lighter, more ergonomic, single frame medical face shield without extra components to assemble would be useful, especially for individual designers/makers and noncommercial producers to increase productivity in a shorter timeframe. In this study, a medical face shield that is competitively lighter, relatively more ergonomic, easy to use, and can be assembled without extra components (such as elastic bands, softening materials, and clips) was designed. The face shield was produced by AM with a relatively shorter production time. Subsequently, finite element analysis-based structural design verification was performed, and a three-dimensional (3D) prototype was produced by an original equipment manufacturer 3D printer (Fused Deposition Modeling). This study demonstrated that an original face shield design with <10 g material usage per single frame was produced in under 45 min of fabrication time. This research also provides a useful product DfAM of simple medical equipment such as face shields through advanced engineering design, simulation, and AM applications as an essential approach to battling coronavirus-like viral pandemics.",

Following the identification and confirmation of a new type of coronavirus called 2019-nCoV by the Chinese authorities [1] , the WHO officially named the disease caused by the coronavirus as coronavirus disease (COVID)-19, which stands for \"COVID 2019\" on February 11, 2020 [2] , and declare the pandemic on March 11, 2020 [3] . Since the date of the first case of this virus spreading, the world has been struggling with this emergent state. During this period, international and national authorities have been announcing public advice and putting in place legal regulations regarding social behavioral habits and the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) for public and health-care services. During this pandemic, health-care institutions have become one of the most hazardous environments to work in, especially for healthcare workers (HW) who deliver care and services to the sick and ailing either directly as medical doctors and nurses or indirectly as aides, helpers, laboratory technicians, or even medical waste handlers, who are considered to be in the high-risk groups [4] . The outbreaks of serious airborne infectious diseases, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Avian Influenza and now the COVID-19, as well as severe infectious agents associated with body fluid exposures (e.g., Ebola virus) have called for increased attention to face/eye protection as the face is the most common body part exposed to the acutely-expelled aerosols of patient body fluids during HW-patient interaction [5] .",

In addition to meeting the demand of this pre-existing group of face shield users, the need for this type of PPE in many countries, including Turkey and the United Kingdom, has increased drastically since the COVID-19 pandemic. On March 3, 2020, the WHO expressed the concern over the shortage of 32 International Journal of Bioprinting (2020)-Volume 6, Issue 4 PPE that could endanger HW worldwide; therefore, announced a call for increased manufacture of face shield by 40 % to meet the rising global demand for this type of PPE [11] .

However, most of these products were not carefully designed with due consideration to professional and ergonomic product design principles, and design for AM (DfAM) approaches. A design can be functional and may correspond to the needs within pre-defined design specifications; however, this may not indicate that the design has structurally and functionally optimized features. For most of the designs generated, it was not known where or how they were approved. These designs also have relatively longer production and component assembly times per unit product (more than 4 -5 production hours; about 2 h in average), and some of the products are heavier considering their custom designs. Besides, most of them, which are equipped with additional components such as elastic bands, softening materials, and fastening clips could cause user discomfort after using for long working hours and constant taking on/off operations. These facts appear as disadvantages for a product within the context of ergonomics and total AM-based production time. In addition, from a post-prototyping perspective, most of these products do not have convenient structural design features that are amenable for commercial mass/ serial production using conventional manufacturing methods such as plastic injection molding. Therefore, a lighter, more ergonomic, and single frame medical face shield without extra components for assembly would be useful for homemakers, individual designers/makers, and noncommercial producers (primary target) to provide effective, functional rapid-prototyped products, which may have a commercial potential (secondary target) in a relatively shorter time. The disadvantages of the current PPE manufacturing method were the main sources of motivation for this design study as the product designs are dynamic, and can be seen changing stages on an existing product over time, in shape and function. These changing stages can be in different range and sudden, others move step by step. In any case, the major aim of the change is to improve the design, to make the product more effective or, put simply, just more appropriate for use in the current pandemic (i.e., low-cost, quick to produce, and disposable).",

From the infection control standpoint, protector components serve to minimize or prevent eye and face exposure of the wearer to sprays, splashes, or droplets of blood, body fluids, excretions, secretions, and other potentially infectious materials in occupational and educational environments, where biological hazards are expected. Hence, in this perspective, various face shield design samples and patent registrations can be found from a simple internet search; however, the number of informative scientific publications for user guides, design details, and AM and conventional or non-conventional manufacturing applications of face shield are very limited. Within the limited literature, a useful scientific review regarding face shields used for infection control to assist in the selection and proper utilization of this type of PPE was published by Roberge (2016) . In addition, the WHO, NHS England, and Texas Medical Association Turkey have been updating their advisory guidelines/publications for the use of medical PPE. These are the sources available to collect reference information related to design and structure, regulatory standards, and guidelines to proper use and selection of the PPE and describe the product as PPE that provides barrier protection to the facial area and related mucous membranes (eyes, nose, and lips).

As shown schematically in two of well-known references, Budynas and Nisbett (2011) outline the idealized, iterative, and top-down phases in design [13] and Kamrani and Nasr (2010) draws an engineering design process path which indicates a similar process for the product design [14] .

In this regard, five design candidates, which have the potential to meet with these pre-defined objectives, were designed and proposed at the concept stage. These candidates were analyzed through technical functional analysis (TFA), and the best candidate design was selected for prototype testing.

Considering the importance of the product application as discussed within this work, the authors based their redesign/design improvement or new design decisions on the guidelines given from the value analysis (VA) methodology developed by Miles in 1948 [17] . More specifically, TFA was deployed to develop the optimal technical solution that best meets the concrete expression of the customers\" need, at minimum cost. The external and internal functional analysis takes into consideration the main functions that the face shield needs to perform to meet both customer expectations and manufacturer specifications [18] . TFA offers a variety of tools and instruments, but for the purpose of this study, the following main stages were deployed: Function identification and characterization; ranking and valuation of the functions; economic dimensioning; result and critical evaluation of the functions; and proposal of concepts. TFA can be conducted as an iterative method, which allows product performance improvement with each new step, thus obtaining at the end of the process an optimized concept. Function analysis system technique (FAST) diagrams [19] were used for all lifecycle stages of the face shield to accurately identify the main functions. Based on FAST and in relation to the main ten design objectives identified before for the face shield's functions were defined.",

In the case of the face shield, economic dimensioning was based on the hypothesis of evaluating the average values of the main characteristics, which can include product weight, product performance, direct and indirect costs, and manufacturing time. After TFA is deployed, these average values are stated as final requirements and metrics with ideal values. Thus, market research considered different types of materials and their individual characteristics, costs, life span, recycling procedures, production volumes, and other particular features of the face shield and of the production process. The research team selected material extrusion (MEx, also referred to as Fused Deposition Modeling [FDM] or Fused Filament Fabrication) as the primary AM process to produce the redesigned face shield. PLA material was selected due to the ease of printing and an advantageous cost-performance ratio. Considering that singlepart weighs an average of 20 g (weight of reference products) and it can be manufactured in 60 min from medium grade PLA filament with a price of 170 monetary units per kilogram, the total cost of manufacturing one face shield structure is 32.48 monetary units. Based on the findings of the market analysis, the total calculated costs were assigned by a TFA specialist, as presented in Table 3 . Each function participates in the total cost with a percentage value, noted with y Fi , i = 1\u00f710. For the redesign of a face shield, the percentage values of the functions participation in the total costs are: y F1 = 9.852%, y F2 = 6.958%, y F3 = 13.793%, y F4 = 15.763%, y F5 = 10.160%, y F6 = 5.849%, y F7 = 7.758%, y F8 = 9.236%, y F9 = 8.312%, y F10 = 12.315%.",

This way, secondary functions that are very expensive in relation to the objective functions, or even more expensive than these, can be identified for further improvement.

To diminish the S value, the points represented by the function weightings must be aligned as perfectly as possible along the regression line. The objective of TFA is to redesign and diminish costs or increase the value for the functions corresponding to the points above the regression line. By changing those specific points and replotting the diagram, the slope of the regression line modifies, and a new situation of TFA can be evaluated. As stated before, the process is iterative, and it is undertaken until the requirements of both customers and manufacturers are met. The critical evaluation of the functions presented in Diagram D presents the most expensive functions in relation to their value. Functions F4, F1, and F2 have disproportionate costs in relation to their value contribution. Function F4 was also identified in the first TFA stage as being the second most important in value, and thus, the designers will focus on the face shield features that address this specific function.",

The findings from the tests were evaluated in the virtual environment for potential design changes. In this study, the virtual prototype was tested to determine head holding force and deformation behavior. To evaluate the deformation behavior of the prototype, the finite element method (FEM)-based structural deformation analysis (FEA) was carried out. The structural module of the ANSYS Workbench FEM-based commercial code was employed for the FEA. In the FEA scenarios, head wearing and head holding positions were simulated. The FEA was set up using assumptions of a linear static loading and homogeneous, linear isotropic material model. At the meshing operation, a curvature meshing strategy was utilized and the skewness metric, which is one of the primary mesh quality measures in a FEA, was checked. The shape and asymmetry of distribution can be measured by its skewness, which can be considered as the mesh quality verification of a FEM [22] . The skewness value of zero indicates an equilateral cell (best) and a value of one indicates a completely degenerate cell (worst) [23] . At the final meshing operation, FEM was created with minimum element size of 0.4 mm, and the average skewness value of 0.227 was obtained. This value indicated that the FE model used in the loading scenarios has an excellent mesh quality. Details related to the FEA set up, and simulation outputs are given in Figure 5 .",

To evaluate 43 the physical prototype of the face shield, an AM approach was utilized in this study; however, the critical point here is that DfAM is a challenge for most designers as the convenient design methods that consider the unique capabilities of AM technologies are needed. Depending on the capabilities of the AM technology being utilized, DfAM can be described as a type of design method whereby functional performance and/or other key product lifecycle considerations such as manufacturability, reliability, and cost can be optimized [25] .

            "text": "AM brings unique considerations for engineers in the design process for medical PPE. An important issue in the use of PPE for medical purposes is biological consideration (including cleaning, sterilization, and biocompatibility). In consideration of unregulated PPE production during this COVID-19 pandemic, recently, a discussion was reported by MIT news on the limitations and dangers of using AM/3D printing for PPE fabrication [28] . The text reports that one of the biggest risks with AM-fabricated products for COVID-19 is the false sense of hope as quickly produced PPE inevitably fails to meet any of the needs previously discussed. This is crucial when considering critical PPE products such as filtration masks, which may need expert design consideration and medical/health service authority approvals, may do more harm than good. The additional risk from unregulated PPE also exists as many FDM filaments retain ambient moisture, which could pose a paradoxically increased risk for virus transmission during use or reuse [29] . Similar risks and concerns were also reviewed and reported by Clifton et al. (2020) [30] . The authors reported that during this pandemic, the open distribution and propagation of PPE prototypes happened before validation and hypothesis formulation (in the context of both engineering and biological considerations) that emphasized on the fundamentally important factors for prototype testing, such as number needed to treat and reduce harm for patients, and the approval of health service authorities had not been considered. Hence, it was possible to highlight the need for universal standardization for PPE, such as medical face shield products. True innovation can prevail over brief notoriety and avoid unintentional harm from good intentions led by poor science [30] . This study provided an original design which was developed based on scientific principles of advanced engineering design and AM methods, with the product being convenient for single-use (means of economic base) and sterilization (with limited cycles) in case of reuse in a risk-based environment such as COVID-19 (+) with close HW-patient interaction.",
