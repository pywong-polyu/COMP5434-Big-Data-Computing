Simulation data were post-processed to calculate the amounts of particles inhaled by nearby passengers. Different airflow rates were used, as well as different initial conditions to account for random fluctuations of the flow field. Overall, 80% of the particles were removed from the cabin in 1.3-2.6 min, depending on conditions, and 95% of the particles were removed in 2.4-4.6 min. Reducing airflow increased particle dispersion throughout the cabin but did not increase the highest exposure of nearby passengers. The highest exposure was 0.3% of the nonvolatile mass expelled by the cough, and the median exposure for seats within 3 feet of the cough discharge was 0.1%, which was in line with recent experimental testing.",

Sneezing, which is a higher-magnitude perturbation than coughing, was not selected for study because it is not a symptom of COVID-19 2 . The Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) model that had been developed in the aftermath of SARS-CoV-1 with funding from the Federal Aviation Administration 3-6 was updated to reflect improvements in the understanding of expiratory emissions and in the availability of computational resources. Analysis was performed to predict material transport during and after a cough discharge. Material inhaled by other passengers was used to quantify passenger exposure-or, viewed alternately, to characterize the efficiency of the aircraft system at protecting passengers from exposure to infectious material. www.nature.com/scientificreports/ Under most conditions, air supplied to the aircraft cabin is a mixture of outside air with air removed from the cabin, which is filtered before it is recirculated. Recirculation is used both to improve fuel efficiency and to increase humidity during flight, as humidity is a factor in comfort. A less common condition that may occur during ground operations is that no outside air is available, so all air supplied to the cabin is the filtered recirculated air. Either scenario provides high-purity air through the use of high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters, which remove 99.97% of particles at 0.3 \u03bcm 7 , a filtration level that is sufficient to remove viruses contained in droplet nuclei of respiratory emissions. The outside air is assumed to be free of pathogens, and its pressure, temperature, and humidity are adjusted to comfortable levels on the way to the cabin by either the Environmental Control System or the ground supply sources.",

Specifically, the distribution of SARS-CoV-2 across particles of different sizes is not known, but is likely non-uniform: for example, influenza RNA is shed predominantly in smaller particles 9-11 even though larger particles account for the bulk of the expelled volume. Further, smaller particles may be more infectious, as they deposit deeper in the respiratory tract when inhaled, and fewer pathogens are needed with other diseases to produce infection in the lower vs. upper respiratory tract [12] [13] [14] .

The amount inhaled by the susceptible passengers depended primarily on their proximity to the index subject and on airflow rate, with random fluctuations of the flow field also having a www.nature.com/scientificreports/ significant role. Humidity did not have a substantial effect within the low-humidity range that is typical of cruise altitudes, Supplementary Figs. S7 and S8. Three airflow cases were studied that cover the range of airflow rates that would be expected over the course of a journey, with 77% being the average. The lowest flow rate studied, 55%, may occur on the ground during the boarding and deplaning segments, when both the engines and the auxiliary power unit (APU) are off, and no ground air supply is available. While this scenario is less common, it provided a lower bound airflow rate for calculating exposures of susceptible passengers to an infected index person. Decreasing the airflow rate increased the dispersion of expiratory particles throughout the cabin, but did not increase the maximum exposure to expiratory material. While exposures of passengers seated away from the index subject increased, exposures of the index passenger's neighbors remained the same within the variability caused by random flow field fluctuations. For passengers seated away from the index subject, exposure remained on par or lower than exposure of passengers seated in the same triplet of seats as the index.",

In that work, tracer aerosols were discharged from various seat locations throughout Boeing 767 and 777 passenger www.nature.com/scientificreports/ cabins, both on the ground and in flight, and their distribution over time was measured from 40 + nearby seats for each discharge. A subset of 75 test discharges whose conditions most closely matched those in the computational work was used for comparisons. Data were binned by distance to the index subject as shown in Fig. 5 to compare the model to the experimental results in both the near and the intermediate field, and to account for differences in seating configurations. Particle exposures were within the same order of magnitude, Fig. 7 . While the highest exposure values were observed experimentally, those values were outliers, which were far less likely to be captured in the computational work due to the much smaller sample size: only one computational case was used for comparisons because it was the only case that matched the experimental airflow conditions. On the other hand, the median values were surprisingly similar given the differences in methods that were used to generate the two datasets, Table 1 . A partial explanation is that the metric that was used to describe results, exposure as a percentage of discharge, appears sufficiently robust to account for the differences in discharge volumes. A second explanation is that some variables that were expected to affect exposure had no appreciable effect, such as the discharge velocity, which was varied experimentally in a subset of tests, Supplementary Fig. S11 . www.nature.com/scientificreports/ The main difference in results was the effect of distance. While median exposure values were similar between the model and the experimental testing for seats more than 3 ft from the index location, median exposure was higher in the model for susceptible seats that were within 3 ft. At the time of writing, this difference in trends cannot be attributed to any specific methodological factor since the effects of several methodological variables on the spatial distribution of particles have not been characterized in prior work. First, the airflow structures of the single-aisle aircraft used in the model and the twin-aisle aircraft used experimentally are inherently different, but how that difference affects particle transport is unknown. Second, the size of particles affects their aerodynamic behavior, and different size distributions were used in the model and experimentally to represent either coughing or breathing. However, most studies of the relationship between travel range and particle size are performed in the absence of airflow, so the effect on transport in high airflow conditions that are characteristic of aircraft but rare otherwise is also unknown.",

Absolute particle counts were obtained from the metric reported by Zayas et al. of particles per cm 3 using the instrument analysis volume of 7.85 cm 3 . This brought the count to approximately 106 M for a reported material volume of 0.0544 \u03bcL. (In contrast, some current literature reports include particle counts in the tens of thousands). No correction was made to account for the distance from the mouth of the test subject to the instrument sensor, which was 17 cm. The resulting particle size distribution is shown in Supplementary Fig. S3 . www.nature.com/scientificreports/ Cough dynamics were modeled using the methodology of Gupta et al. 3 . The arbitrarily selected inputs of cough peak flow rate of 3.67 L/s, cough expired volume of 0.7 L, and peak velocity time of 76.2 ms were used to generate the profile of airflow expelled by the cough, which was truncated at 0.4 s (or 10% of the cough peak flow rate) and is shown in Supplementary Fig. S4 .

Thermal boundary conditions, listed in Supplementary Table S2 , were selected to maintain the cabin temperature at the passenger-preferred 75\u00b0F while applying the airflow rates of interest. Composition of the continuous phase (the mixture of air and water vapor) was solved using the Eulerian scheme, which accounted for interactions between expiratory particles and the surrounding medium, including heat transfer and evaporation. In this scheme, expiratory particles were modeled as water with a volatile fraction of 90% 25 . However, their vapor pressure was adjusted by a factor of 0.28 to account for the effect of pulmonary surfactants 26 .
