Total monthly mean AE SD LDCTs (146 AE 31 vs 39 AE 40; p < 0.01) and new patient monthly LDCTs (56 AE 14 vs 15 AE 17; p < 0.01) were significantly decreased during the COVID-19 period. New patient monthly LDCTs have remained low despite resuming full operations. Three-and 6-month interval follow-up LDCTs were prioritized and were significantly increased compared with baseline (11 AE 4 vs 30 AE 4; p < 0.01). The \"no-show\" rate was significantly increased from baseline (15% vs 40%; p < 0.04). Most concerning, the percentage of patients with lung nodules suspicious for malignancy (Lung-RADS 4) were significantly increased after screenings resumed (8% vs 29%; p < 0.01). Lung cancer is the leading cause of mortality among cancer diagnoses, and was responsible for 145,849 deaths in the US alone in 2017. 1 Fortunately, during the last decade, lung cancer mortality has been in an accelerated decline 1 due to successful public health campaigns, such as smoking cessation 2,3 and therapeutic improvements. 4 In addition, annual low-dose CT (LDCT) screening programs have been found to reduce mortality from lung cancer by at least 20% among high-risk patients in large clinical trials. 5, 6 In December 2013, the US Preventive Services Task Force published guidelines recommending LDCT for adults with the following criteria: aged 55 to 80 years, 30 pack-year smoking history, and currently smoking or quit within the last 15 years. 7 The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the healthcare industry has been tremendous, with immediate consequences on resource use and wide-ranging long-term implications throughout medicine. 8 Cancer care has not been spared, with difficult but necessary decisions to mitigate risk during the early phases of the pandemic. 9 Cancer diagnoses in the US were decreased across 6 common malignancies, 10 and The Netherlands Cancer Registry noted an almost 30% decrease in all primary cancer diagnoses. 11 The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on screening and subsequent cancer diagnosis is unknown. Early detection through effective screening programs saves lives in colorectal, breast, and lung cancer. 6, 12, 13 Early in the COVID-19 pandemic, an expert panel from the American College of Chest Physicians recommended delaying initiation of screening for new individuals and delaying annual LDCT for patients in established lung cancer screening protocols. 14 However, the short-and longterm outcomes after delaying screening in this population have not been studied. The purpose of this study was to examine the impact of COVID-19 on lung cancer screening and subsequent cancer at our institution.",

There was decreased total and new patients screened during the COVID-19 period, even after screening operations resumed. Patients were also more likely to be a no-show for their LDCT after screening resumed. A higher proportion of Lung-RADS 4 nodules were identified and there were increased referrals for intervention.

            "text": "COVID-19 has dramatically impacted many aspects of medicine, including the field of oncology. Cross-sectional analysis of diagnosis codes demonstrated a 46% decrease in new cancer diagnoses in the US during March and April 2020 among 6 common malignancies, including lung and esophageal cancer. 10 The Netherlands Cancer Registry noted an almost 30% decrease in new cancer diagnoses in all primary cancer sites; new lung cancer diagnoses had a similar decrease. 11 New cancer diagnoses remained low, despite a national public awareness campaign to increase cancer diagnoses by encouraging patients to discuss new symptoms with their primary care provider, encouraging primary care providers to refer patients to oncology specialist, and resuming cancer screening operations. 11 In our study, we observed a decrease in total and new patient monthly LDCTs during 17 and colon cancer. 18, 19 National use of LDCT is low at baseline, so any additional decreases has potential negative consequences both in terms of cancer-related mortality and future use of lung cancer screening. [20] [21] [22] Fear related to contracting COVID-19 has caused patients to be more apprehensive to seek medical care for routine or emergent issues. 23, 24 Diagnoses for many acute conditions, such as appendicitis, MI, stroke, and aortic dissection have decreased during the COVID-19 pandemic. [25] [26] [27] [28] Similarly, in our study, new-patient monthly LDCTs remained low despite resuming full lung cancer screening operations, and the no-show rate was increased significantly. We observed that patients who were younger, female, African American, and current smokers were more likely to no-show for LDCT. This aspect of lung cancer screening should be studied further, as it could worsen existing disparities in lung cancer survival. African Americans already have worse overall survival 29 and are less likely to undergo curative lung resection. 30 Risk mitigation from COVID-19 is important in cancer patients, with reports of 13% mortality in cancer patients affected with COVID-19. 31 Lung cancer patients are particularly at risk due to underlying comorbidities, such as smoking and pulmonary disease. Patients with thoracic malignancies infected with COVID-19 have a reported 76% hospitalization rate and 33% mortality rate. 32 Several societies and expert panels have released recommendations for the management of malignancy during the COVID-19 pandemic. 33 Specifically for lung cancer, expert panels from the Thoracic Surgery Outcomes Research Network recommended deferring operations for 3 months if hospital resources were limited due to COVID-19. If hospital resources were normal with only a few COVID-19 cases, they recommended operations for node-positive lung cancer, tumors !2 cm, or for those who received neoadjuvant therapy only. 34 Previous reports have found that these delays can increase perioperative morbidity and negatively impact overall survival. 35 Recent evidence from the UK estimates a 4.8% to 5.3% increase in lung cancer mortality due to diagnostic delay, highlighting the critical stakes at hand. 24 We observed increased lung nodules suspicious for malignancy (Lung-RADS 4) after screening operations resumed. Patients were more likely to be referred to tumor board for enlarging nodules and there was a significant increase in referrals for intervention among tumor board patients in the COVID-19 period. There is also a backlog of new patients who are awaiting initial screening, as we are still rescheduling cancelled appointments.",
