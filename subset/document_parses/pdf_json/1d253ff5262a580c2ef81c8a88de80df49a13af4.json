An unresolved challenge for smoking cessation interventions is the detection of factors associated with nicotine use. In order to understand how cognition is affected by nicotine abuse, this study was designed to determine the relationship between years of smoking addiction and several variables of executive functions. The sample was composed of 174 smokers, whose age ranged between 27 and 69 years old (M = 47.44; SD = 8.48). Smokers were assessed at baseline with measures of cognitive inhibition [Go/No Go Task and Five Digit Test (FDT)], updating [Visual Search and Attention Test (VSAT) and Letter-Number Sequencing (WAIS IV)] and shifting [Delay Discounting Task (DDT) and Iowa Gambling Task (IGT)] while the outcome measure was years of smoking.",

            "text": "Several factors are identified to have an impact on smoking addiction: age of initiation (5, 6) , negative affective states (7) (8) (9) , mood disorders (10), psychiatric disorders (11, 12) and executive functioning (8, (13) (14) (15) . The addiction process elicits neuroadaptations that affect broadly distributed neural circuits involved in cognitive process (16) . Indeed, there is increasing evidence that executive functions have significant effects on nicotine dependence. Executive function (EF) refers to a \"set of general-purpose control processes that regulate one's thoughts and behaviors\" (17) . Miyake et al. (18) identified three different components of EF: (1) Inhibitory processes, (2) Updating, and (3) Shifting processes (18) . However, studies examining associations between executive measures and clinical aspects of smoking such as years of smoking addiction are reduced and generally limited to predict risk profiles. Also, existing literature examining the effects of EF on substance abuse focuses on inhibition and working memory components (14) . Flaudias et al. (13) evaluated the influence of executive functions (inhibition, updating and shifting) on craving [The Tobacco Craving Questionnaire; (19) ] and nicotine dependence [Fagerstr\u00f6m Test for Nicotine Dependence, (20) ] in a sample of moderate (Fagerstr\u00f6m >3) and severe (Fagerstr\u00f6m >7) smokers. They used a Stroop task (21) and Hayling's test (22) as measures of inhibition, \"Trail Making Test\" (23) as a measure of shifting, and the \"N-back\" test (24) for updating. The dimension of inhibition seems to be a significantly stronger predictor of tobacco dependence than craving or updating abilities (13) . Findings are reminiscent of the work of Billieux et al. (25) who has discovered that a poor ability to inhibit evaluated by a go-stop task (26) as well as age are significant predictors of tobacco dependence evaluated by Fagerstr\u00f6m Test for Nicotine Dependence, (20) . Further, Hu et al. (27) examined the relationship between smoking and cognitive performance in working memory among smokers and non-smokers. All participants were evaluated with the subtests of information, arithmetic and digits (28) and the Dysexecutive Questionnaire (29) . In addition, smokers were measured on their level of nicotine dependence (20) . Smokers reported lower performance on the arithmetic and digit subtests than non-smokers. There was also a direct correlation between digit scores (reverse order condition) and age of smoking initiation. On the other hand, smokers had higher scores on the dysexecutive questionnaire than non-smokers (27) . Taken together, poor executive functions have been linked to nicotine abuse but it is unclear whether such executive components differentially interfere with each stage of addiction. Furthermore, to our knowledge, there are no studies that explore years of smoking addiction as a possible factor linked to executive performance.",

Firstly, smoking cessation therapies are ineffective for most treatment-seeking smokers (30) . A better understanding of the underpinnings of nicotine use may help to improve smoking cessation treatment. Secondly, several studies advocate the idea of including further smoking history variables because they would provide possible illustrative predictors of correlates of nicotine dependence (31, 32) . Finally, exploring neuropsychological measures among different smoking patterns could lead to potential implications for prevention and treatment (33) . In this regard, a comprehensive assessment will help to identify possible inter-subject variables that may be associated with a pattern of sustained tobacco abuse. In response to these limitations, we conducted a naturalistic and cross-sectional study to identify key factors that promote nicotine use. Particularly, this study was designed to determine the effects of several executive control functions. Assuming the three components of the dominant executive functioning model (18) , we assessed inhibitory processes, updating and shifting on clinical aspects of smoking. In agreement with existing studies, we hypothesized that inhibition and updating components would be associated with years of addiction. Furthermore, we expected to find that long-term smokers should report more signs of executive dysfunction.",

The aim of this study was to identify predictors of years of smoking addiction in a sample of current smokers. Specifically, we investigated the influence of neurocognitive variables such as updating, inhibitory control and cognitive flexibility ability. Results from the analysis revealed that the regression model including neurocognitive scores showed satisfactory fit explaining 22.2% of variance. However, an inspection of parameter estimates showed that the dimension of working memory (VSAT)was significantly and inversely associated with Years of smoking addiction. In consequence, the main finding of this study was that a poorer performance in working memory predicts the primary outcome variable. These results are in line with some previous scientific studies which examined the relationship between smoking and cognitive performance in working memory. Sutherland et al. (43) analyzed the effect of nicotine on EF performance through a working memory task based on the continuous-counting paradigm that required maintenance and simultaneous shifting in a sample of smokers and non-smokers. The findings suggest that smokers showed increased sustained activation in the medial and lateral prefrontal cortex during task execution. Smokers were also less effective in mobilizing the cognitive resources required to perform tasks that require recruitment and control of working memory. Thus, the increase in frontal activity recorded in smokers represents the need to increase cognitive resources to guide behavior during task execution (43) . Recent data suggest that smokers performed worse on some cognitive tasks (arithmetic and digits subtests) (28) than nonsmokers. In addition, working memory (scores on digit subtest) was related to the age of starting smoking (27) . In contrast, the lack of findings among others neuropsychological measures could be attributed to the fact that executive components such as inhibition and change are involved in other aspect of nicotine addiction such as relapse or initiation. For example, L\u00f3pez-Torrecillas et al. (44) (44) . Besides, a recent study (46) examined the predictive ability of delayed discounting to predict relapses after six months of tobacco cessation. The logistic regression model reported that longer discount delay, younger age, more previous quit attempts and higher dependence (FTND) were associated with higher risk of relapse at the 6-month follow-up.",

            "text": "On the other hand, multivariate analyses of covariance (MANCOVA) revealed highly significant differences between heavy smokers and light smokers on both VSAT and WAIS tasks after controlling for age via covariate analysis. When age scores were added as covariate in the MANCOVA, the observed differences between light and heavy smokers seemed potentially attributable to the higher levels of nicotine dependence in the heavy smokers. In particular, nicotine dependence level as measured by FTND significantly interacted with updating measures. Sensitivity analyses further showed that long-term smokers (\u226525 years) scored significantly lower on the VSAT task. Besides, groups with both highest levels of dependence on FNDT (>7 points) and highest rates of cigarettes per day (\u226525 CPD) showed worse scores on WAIS task. Group differences in working memory may reflect the injurious effects of smoking. Also, these results indicate that updating measures could be useful to prospectively predict years of addiction, such that they could be utilized to identify potential heavy smokers. Consequently, based on human neuroimaging evidence, the insula is critically involved in maintaining cigarette smoking (47) . Recently, Li et al. (48) investigated the differences in insular morphometry between smokers and non-smokers. The authors explained that the insula had a trend to be negatively correlated (not significant) with pack-years. However, they found decreased cortical thickness of insula in smokers compared to nonsmokers (48) .",

First of all, participants were all employees of the same institution and there may be a concern because the sample is not representative of clinical populations but sufficiently diverse to be representative of the general population. Secondly, the cross-sectional nature of this study makes it difficult to obtain the inferred causal relationship between the variables. However, to our knowledge, this is the first study to show that a cognitive measure (attention task that requires visual search) is significantly associated with years of smoking. Despite these limitations, these findings have important public health implications and suggest that interventions designed for smoking cessation should focus not only on reducing relapses but also on improving executive functions such as working memory and attentional bias to smoking cues. In addition, these findings suggest that cigarette packaging warning (51) may experience a loss of effectiveness in long-term smokers as well as high levels of dependence. In this sense, behavioral approaches that recover cognitive functions help to improve theoretical support (33) . Future studies in this area will have critical value toward reducing deficits in executive control functions, resulting in public health benefits.",
