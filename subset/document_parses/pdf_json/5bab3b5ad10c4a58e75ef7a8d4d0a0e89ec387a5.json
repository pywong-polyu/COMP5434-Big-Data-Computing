In this paper, we present a domain dependent knowledge retrieval framework for household environments which was constructed by extracting knowledge from the VirtualHome dataset (http://virtual-home.org). The framework provides knowledge about sequences of actions on how to perform human scaled tasks in a household environment, answers queries about household objects, and performs semantic matching between entities from the web knowledge graphs DBpedia, ConceptNet, and WordNet, with the ones existing in our knowledge graph. We offer a set of predefined SPARQL templates that directly address the ontology on which our knowledge retrieval framework is built, and querying capabilities through SPARQL. We evaluated our framework via two different user evaluations.",

We can see an extensive survey on these topics in [9] . In this paper, we introduce a novel knowledge retrieval framework 1 for household objects and actions that can be used as part of the knowledge representation component of a cognitive robotic system, which is connected with a custom made semantic matching algorithm to enrich its knowledge. Moreover, to the best of our knowledge our ontology is the largest one about objects and actions, as well as activities (i.e. set of object-action relations).",

Some example queries are \"What actions can I perform with a pot?\", or \"What other objects are related to knife, plate, and fork?\", or even \"What can I turn on if I am in the living room?\". Furthermore, our framework can recommend sequences of actions on how to perform a human scaled task, like \"How can I make a sandwich?\". Our framework is based on a domain-specific ontology that we have developed which contains knowledge from the VirtualHome dataset [17, 23] . The ontology is built in OWL [19] and the Knowledge Base (KB) can be easily extended by adding new instances of objects, actions, and activities.",

To this end, we have devised a semantic match making algorithm that retrieves semantically related knowledge out of three web knowledge graphs, namely DBpedia [5] , ConceptNet [18] , and WordNet [30] . When our framework cannot find an entity in its own KB, it uses the knowledge existing in the aforementioned KBs, to relate the unknown entity with one in our local KB. Also, the framework can provide some general knowledge about objects such as \"How much fat does a banana have?\", with predefined SPARQL query templates addressed to DBpedia.

Instead, we have implemented knowledge about object affordances and we represent knowledge, about objects through their affordances. Furthermore, O-Pro [4] is an ontology for object-affordance relations, but is considerably smaller with respect to the quantity of objects and affordances.

We managed to find what were the most common and crucial queries addressed to a cognitive robotic system and we constructed these templates based on these findings. Example 5 shows the SPARQL template that returns the objects which are related to two other objects, Object1 and Object2. Therefore, users can hand pick one of the predefined queries and then give the keywords that are needed in order to fill the SPARQL template (Example 5), or they can write their own SPARQL query to access the information they desire (Example 6).",

This would broaden the range of queries that the framework can answer, and would overcome the downside of our framework being dataset oriented. Algorithm 1 was implemented using Python. The libraries Request and NLTK 3 offer web APIs for all three aforementioned ontologies. Similar methods can be found in [12, 35] , where they also exploit the CS knowledge existing in web ontologies. Algorithm 1 starts by getting as input any word that is part of the English language; we check this by obtaining the WordNet entity, line 3. The input is given by the user implicitly, when he gives a keyword in a query that does not exist in the KB of the framework. Subsequently, we turn to ConceptNet, and we collect the properties and values for the input word, line 4. In our framework, we collect only the values of some properties such as RelatedTo, UsedFor, AtLocation, and IsA. We choose these properties because they are the most related to our target application of providing information for household objects. Also, we acquire the weights that ConceptNet offers for each triplet. These weights represent how strong the connection is between two different entities with respect to a property in the ConceptNet graph, and are defined by the ConceptNet community. Therefore, we end up with a hash map of the following form: Then, we start extracting semantic similarity between the given entity and the returned property values using WordNet and DBpedia, lines 5-8. Firstly, we find the least common path that the given entity has with each returned value from ConceptNet, in WordNet, line 9. The knowledge in WordNet is in the form of a direct acyclic graph with hyponyms and hypernyms. Thus, in each case we obtain the number of steps that are needed to traverse from one entity to another. Subsequently, we turn to DBpedia to extract comment boxes of each entity using SPARQL, lines 11-13. If DBpedia does not return any results, we search the entity in Wikipedia, which has a better search engine, and with the returned URL we ask again DBpedia for the comment box, based on the mapping scheme between Wikipedia URLs and DBpedia URIs, lines 14-20. Notice that when we encounter a redirection list we acquire the first URL of the list which in most cases is the desired entity, and acquire the comment box.",

We preferred TF-IDF despite its limitations, as it may miss some words only from the difference of one letter, because we did not want to raise the complexity of the framework using pre-trained embedding vectors like Glove [21] , Word2Vec [26] , or FastText [14] , this remains as future work. In order to define the semantic similarity between the entities, we have devised a new metric that is based on the combination of WordNet paths, TF-IDF scores, and ConceptNet weights Eq. (2). We choose this specific metric because it takes into consideration the smallest WordNet path, the ConceptNet weights, and the TF-IDF scores. TF-IDF and ConceptNet scores have a positive contribution to the semantic similarity of two words. On the other hand, the bigger the path is between two words in WordNet the smaller the semantic similarity is.",

            "text": "We evaluated our knowledge retrieval framework via two different user evaluations. Firstly, by asking people how much they are satisfied with the results returned. Basically, we wanted to see if the answers returned by our framework satisfied the users in terms of CS. Due to the fact that we cannot define strict rules on what can be considered as CS, each subject gives their personal opinion to evaluate how satisfied they are with each answer. Thus, we asked for a score from 1 to 5 to eight categories of queries. Each person had to evaluate 40 answers (5 queries of each of the eight categories). Subjects were presented with the Top-5 answers returned for each query. We tried to find people both related to Computer Sciences (CSc) and people not related to Computer Science (N-CSc), resulting in 19 and 23 subjects, respectively. We also made another clustering with the same people based on their education level, Workers 13 (W) that did not go to University, Bachelor/Master Students 23 (B/M), PhD Students 6 (P). The categories of queries that were evaluated are the following: Q1: \"On what objects can I perform the actions X1,..,Xn if I am in room Y?\", Q2: \"On what objects can I perform the actions X1,..,Xn?\", Q3: \"What can I do with objects O1,...,Om?\", Q4: \"What objects are related to objects O1,...,Om?\", Q5: \"Give me the category of activities for X\", Q6: \"Give me related objects to O1,...,Om\", Q7: \"Give me similar action(-s) to A\", and Q8: \"Recommend an Activity based on the description A\". Notice that in Q4, we addressed queries with objects that do not exist in our KB, to see how satisfied people are with the recommendations from Algorithm 1. Table 1 and Table 2 present the Mean and Variance scores, respectively. The results are rounded to two decimals in all the tables. As we can see, we obtained an overall of 4.10/5, which translates to an 82% score. Moreover, regarding the low score of Q4 in comparison to other queries we can comment the following. This happened because we had a very high threshold value to the Ratcliff-Obershelp string similarity metric, which compared the returned results from Algorithm 1 with the ones in our KB. On top of that, we did not display the recommendation from Algorithm 1; instead, we displayed the entity from our KB with which the result of Algorithm 1 was close enough. The threshold was 0.8 and we reduced it to 0.6; for smaller values the recommendations of Algorithm 1 in most cases were not related to our target application. Therefore, we reduced the value of the threshold and displayed the web KB recommendation. We performed these changes in order to affect only Q4. The new results are displayed in Table 3 . We observe that the Mean score for Q4 increased by 13.5%, and the Variance shows that the scoring values came closer to the Mean value by 0.89. In our second evaluation, we asked from 5 subjects not part of the first group to give us their own answers in the queries Q1-Q7, apart from Q4 (we shall denote this by Q1-Q7\\Q4). We omitted Q4 and Q8 because we consider them as less important for evaluating the capabilities of our knowledge retrieval framework. More specifically, from the viewpoint of a user Q4 is similar to Q6, so there was no point asking it again. On the other hand, for the Q8 the 5 subjects were reluctant to answer it because they considered it very time consuming (it required to provide 25 full sentences; not just words as in the case of the other queries), so we could not gather a quantitatively appropriate dataset. Therefore, the 5 subjects had to give us 5 answers based only on their own opinion for 5 queries from each one of Q1-Q7\\Q4. We resulted with a baseline dataset of 125 answers for each query. Next, 34 subjects from the first evaluation agreed to proceed with the second round of evaluation. Each one had to give one answer, for 5 queries from each one of the queries Q1-Q7\\Q4 (5 * 6 = 30 answers in total) picked from the aforementioned dataset.",

Secondly, the second method of evaluation implies that our knowledge retrieval framework could be used as a baseline for evaluating other cognitive robotic systems acting in a household environment. Thirdly, the scores that Algorithm 1 achieved, show that it can be used as an individual service for semantically matching entities of a knowledge graph with entities from ConceptNet, DBpedia, and WordNet as it can be easily extended with more properties.",

Furthermore, with an instance generator algorithm we translated the activities as instances of the ontology classes. Therefore, we obtained knowledge, about how actions and objects are related, what objects are related with each other, what objects and actions exist in an activity, and suggestions on how to perform an activity in a household environment, through a set of predefined SPARQL query templates. The knowledge retrieval framework can also address hand-coded SPARQL queries to its own KB. Additionally, we broadened the range of queries the framework can answer, by developing a Semantic Matching Algorithm that finds semantic similarity, between entities existing in our KB and entities from the knowledge graphs of DBpedia, ConceptNet, and WordNet.",
