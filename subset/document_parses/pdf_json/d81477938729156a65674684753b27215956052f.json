It is fundamentally to protect digital investments, contribute to national economic wellbeing by providing a safe, secure and conducive environment to conduct business and to protect a nation's critical national infrastructures and citizens welfare. In this paper, we investigate operational factors that influence situational awareness of CyberOps, specifically, the features that deals with understanding and comprehension of operational and human factors aspects and that helps with insights on human operator decision making (e.g., cognition, teamwork, knowledge, skills and abilities). The operational factors discussed in this paper range from tools, techniques, integration, architecture to automation, cognition, people, policy, process and procedures.",

The sophistication is as a result of advances in technology, automation and emerging techniques, for example, advances in machine learning and artificial intelligence have been leveraged to conduct deepfake (exact copy look-alike) of genuine emails, transactions, audio and video transcripts. We do not suggest that the several folds increase in cyber-attacks in the last 12 months of the COVID-19 pandemic is as a result of sophistication in technology, and neither are we suggesting that all the recent cyber-attacks have used sophisticated techniques. Indeed, some recent attacks have used sophisticated techniques to evade detection, but the fact remains, majority used the same 'old' techniques that have been in the wild for several years. Further, these attacks do not target one type of organisation, a particular vertical, country or region.

We recognise that a capability may address multiple issues and may be aligned to a couple of domains (that is in respect to the NIST CSF, of identify, protect, detect, respond and recover), hence where we believe this to be the case, we colour-coded the subcomponents of the capability in overlapping colours. For example, capabilities #10 (Security Testing), #13 (Cloud Security) and #17 (Cyber Analytics) are divided primarily into two.

We argue that 'identity'-based protection offers robust security over perimeter-defence since better understanding of the risks presented by the identity and the endpoint is far more prudent than 'perimeter' focuseddefence. Conditional access is predicated on the continuous assessment of risks and trust of identity and entity (see Fig. 2 ) requesting access to critical services may poss. These conditions are essential for achieving conditional access: a) Could the identity and endpoint be used to compromise the service? b) Could the entity (e.g., health hygiene) be in such a condition e.g., malware infested, such that through it the service it may be requested may be infested with malware? c) Could the entity pose material risks, geographical risks (e.g., geolocation) or regulatory risks (e.g., access from certain geographies that are under a sanction or prohibited from accessing the service)? d) Could there be underlying risk (e.g., backdoor access) that this entity may introduce? e) Could the entity or identity be used for financial extortion? f) Could the access originate from identity and/or entity from a geography (geo-location) that is prohibited or untrusted (e.g., risky) g) Is the behaviour of the identity and entity symptomatic of an attacker (e.g., odd, unusual, or suspicious behaviour), e.g., access at odd times, random access to several services that the identity does not have access to, and/or should not be accessing e.g., hidden files, protected documents etc.",

People will always be required in most manner of endeavors in some form or another. This is most pertinent with cyber; while we now develop machine learning models that can predict cyberattacks, artificial intelligence models that can recognise speeches and deep learning models that can investigate, recommend and optimise choices for humans, there are still, at least for now, areas and use cases where human operators are needed and will still be required in future. For example, in decision making, escalations, cyber security investigations, and prosecutions etc. There is no doubt that human operators will depend on cyber physical systems, machine learning models etc. for swifter, more precise and optimised choices, however, it will be a case of interdependency than replacement or displacement. We see a cooperative situation where humans leverage technological power, prowess, speed and accuracy in human decision making, prioritisation and resolution.",
