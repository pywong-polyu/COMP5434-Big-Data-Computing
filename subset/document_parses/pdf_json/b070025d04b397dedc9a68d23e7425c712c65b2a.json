Peak rates of high burnout occurred at the second or third measurement point for each occupational group, with lower rates at the fourth measurement point.

Reports from crosssectional studies have consistently indicated, for example, high rates of depressive and anxiety symptoms, sleep disturbance and burnout in healthcare workers [3] [4] [5] [6] . Professional burnout is a particularly important outcome of occupational stress in healthcare because, in addition to its impact on individual professionals, burnout has adverse consequences for the healthcare system and patients, including absenteeism, higher workforce turnover, reduced productivity, increased medical errors, and reduced quality of care [7] [8] [9] [10] . As described by Maslach and colleagues [11] , burnout is comprised of three components: emotional exhaustion, depersonalization (becoming indifferent or emotionally distant), and a diminished sense of personal accomplishment. Burnout was recognized prior to the COVID-19 pandemic to be a major occupational risk in health care [12, 13] . Workplace factors that were known to contribute to burnout include high workload, lack of scheduling flexibility, the burden of administrative tasks, and concern about workplace safety [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] . In addition to workplace stressors that were present prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, additional potential sources of burnout have emerged, including constraints on care that cause moral distress [21, 22] , and redeployment to unfamiliar types of work [23] .",

In particular, after the 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) had resolved, healthcare workers in affected hospitals reported a range of stress effects that continued to be significantly elevated compared to workers in non-affected hospitals for as long as they were followed, which was 18-24 months [28] . Of concern, the COVID-19 pandemic is far more severe, widespread and persistent than the SARS outbreak and has severely affected many aspects of life in the community as well as in the hospital, which suggests its mental impact will be greater, and may resolve more slowly. Furthermore, pre-pandemic rates of burnout in many settings were high, in the range of 20-40% [29] [30] [31] , indicating that even full resolution of pandemic-related factors would still leave healthcare workers at considerable risk. On the other hand, there is much evidence that in general, the most common long-term response to exposure to highly aversive events is resilience [32] .",

In particular, it would be useful to determine if negative mental health effects are rising monotonically over time, as one would expect to result from accumulating stress effects, or following a different pattern, possibly rising when COVID-19 cases are higher and improving as COVID-19 case rates decrease. Going forward, interventions to support healthcare workers' well-being could differ in these two scenarios. Longitudinal data published thus far in the COVID-19 pandemic gives little insight into these long-term patterns because it has covered periods early in the pandemic, typically with either two measurement points or over a period of only a few weeks. Studies of longer-term patterns of burnout and psychological distress later in the pandemic have not yet been published.",

Various case definitions of burnout based on MBI-HSS scores have been used previously, which differ in the choice of cut-off scores, and various combinations of the three scales [29] . In order to allow comparison to a broad range of prior studies, we used the emotional exhaustion scale as our primary continuous measure of burnout, and defined burnout using a cut-off of \u226527, which is commonly used to identify high emotional exhaustion [29] [30] [31] . As secondary measures, to describe trends in other aspects of burnout we measured depersonalization and personal accomplishment in those participants randomly selected for the Enriched survey, using the most common cut-offs of depersonalization \u226510 and personal accomplishment are \u226433 when reporting case numbers [29] . In this cohort Cronbach's alpha at the four time-points varied from .94 to .95. Psychological distress is comprised of depressive and anxiety symptoms. Psychological distress was measured with the Kessler K6, which has 6 items scored from 0 to 4, yielding a range of 0-24. The K6 strongly discriminates between community cases and non-cases of psychiatric disorders diagnosed by structured interview and has acceptable sensitivity and specificity [35, 36] . A cut-off of \u226513 indicates likely serious mental illness [37] . In this cohort Cronbach's alpha at the four time-points varied from .85 to .87.",

Gender was not included because it is confounded with occupational role in hospital settings (in particular, in this cohort nurses were 84% female and other nonphysician healthcare workers were 87% female). Setting within the hospital (e.g. emergency department, intensive care unit) could not be included in the analysis because (i) many staff members work in multiple settings, and (ii) there were frequent dynamic changes in work settings for many staff members related to having multiple roles or having reassigned duties (e.g. medical nurses re-assigned to intensive care for a period of time and then returning to the medical unit).

            "text": "The severity of emotional exhaustion was greatest in nurses, followed by healthcare professionals of other disciplines, then nonprofessional staff whose work involves close patient contact, with the lowest levels in nonprofessional staff whose work does not involve close patient contact. While workplace factors that contributed to burnout prior to the pandemic, including high workload, lack of scheduling flexibility, and concern about workplace safety [41] , have increased during the pandemic for all health professionals, arguably some stressors, such as persistent exposure to high acuity or dying patients, and facilitating patientfamilies meetings via tablets or other virtual interfaces have been more common for nurses, which could contribute to this difference. In addition, at the hospital at which this study took place, redeployment to critical care units [23] , and the experience of working a full shift on a unit under \"outbreak status\" were more common for nurses than other professions. Pandemic conditions have led to moral distress, which exacerbates burnout [21, 22] , but it is not known if this has been disproportionality experienced by particular occupational groups. Although not surprising, rates of high emotional exhaustion in nurses are nonetheless alarming. At the four measurement-points they were 54, 62, 63, and 58% respectively, which is substantially greater than the pre-COVID-19 benchmark of 20-40% found using the same operational case definition [29] . As nurses represent the largest single professional group in hospital care, this degree of mental health burden threatens the function of the healthcare system. The rates of burnout in this study can be compared to those reported elsewhere, although most reports currently available relate to studies completed before 2021. In August -October 2020 a survey of Australian nurses using an abbreviated version of the MBI found high emotional exhaustion scores in 44% [42] . A US study conducted over the same time span using a single item burnout measure found high burnout in 66% of nurses [43] . A study of nurses in Uganda in May-June 2021 using the ProQOL instrument found high burnout in 40% [44] . The use of different measurement instruments precludes direct comparison, but these studies confirm multiple reports of high rates of burnout in nurses. A survey of internists at two hospitals in Vancouver, Canada from August-October 2020, found high emotional exhaustion in 63% using the same operational definition used in this study [45] , which is consistent with our results. Burnout has not often been measured previously in hospital employees with roles other than regulated professionals, and so there is little historical context from which to interpret the degree of burnout found in that group.",

Inspection of Fig. 1 indicates that in three of the four groups this pattern consisted of a monotonic increase from fall 2020 to spring 2021, with a decrease from spring to summer 2021. The fourth group, nonprofessional staff with no close patient contact, appeared to differ only by beginning the descending trend sooner, peaking in winter 2021. Since the decrease in rates of high emotional exhaustion in summer 2021 corresponds to a period of low levels of new COVID-19 cases in the community, and corresponding low rates of COVID-19 related hospitalization, the trend may indicate that emotional exhaustion in hospital-based healthcare workers is able to recover somewhat as COVID-19 stresses subside. It is noteworthy that COVID-19 vaccination rates in the general public and in healthcare workers increased markedly in Ontario between the spring and summer 2021 surveys, which may have also contributed to reduced burnout. Importantly, the improvement in high emotional exhaustion during the summer of 2021 was an improvement to levels that remain much higher than the pre-COVID-19 benchmark.",

Rates of depersonalization increased steadily over this time, which may indicate that depersonalization is a cumulative effect of pandemic related stress that is less responsive to decreasing case rates than emotional exhaustion. Alternatively, depersonalization could be viewed as a coping strategy (i.e. sacrificing empathic patient care in the service of maintaining personal function). Further observation to determine the downstream consequences of these changes would help distinguish whether increasing depersonalization provides any adaptive benefit. Our participants' sense of personal accomplishment may have been quicker to recover. Alternatively, the improvement in mean levels of personal accomplishment from winter 2021 to spring 2021 may have been the result of participants with low personal accomplishment scores in the winter 2021 dropping out. Post hoc testing reveals that at the winter 2021 measurement, the mean personal accomplishment scores of those who completed surveys in spring 2021 was 6.0 \u00b1 7.0, whereas the mean score in those who did not complete surveys in spring 2021 was 4.3 \u00b1 4.9 (p = .03). Of note, dropping out from the survey cohort could be related to factors which also contribute to staff choosing to leave their jobs. The risk that pandemic-related burnout will contribute to workforce shortages is an important issue [41] and the role of personal accomplishment merits further investigation as a potential mediator.",

Two studies have reported multiple serial measurements of burnout over a period of approximately 1 month. Four measurements of burnout at weekly intervals in April 2020, revealed stable levels of burnout in emergency medicine providers [47] . In contrast, burnout measured in physicians at five time-points over 25-31 days (following joining the COVID-19 treatment team) in Italy revealed variation over time [48] . The results of the current study, which indicate variability over time, rather than monotonic changes in emotional exhaustion and personal accomplishment provide new insight into the temporal pattern of burnout when it is measured over more than two time-points and for longer than a few weeks.",

            "text": "The strengths of this study include its prospective measurement of psychological distress and burnout with validated instruments over a one-year period in a single cohort of healthcare workers and its relatively high retention rate considering the extraordinary circumstances of hospital work during this time. It is also a strength that the survey extended to all workers and learners in the hospital, not just those in regulated professions. Although we consider retaining 76% of participants over four survey waves in 1 year to be a strength, the loss of 24% of the cohort nonetheless introduces the possibility that non-participation results in biases. Several aspects of the study may limit generalizability including that it did not using a sampling strategy that would ensure a representative sample, evidence that psychological indices (i.e. burnout) differ in participants who completed all four surveys and those who did not, its setting in an urban teaching hospital, and high rates of vaccination among healthcare workers after the second survey. Despite enrolling participants based on their willingness to participate, the distribution of occupations and demographic measures suggest that most occupational groups are represented among the survey's participants. A further limitation is that classifying heterogeneous occupational roles into four occupational groups does not attend to differences in the impact of the pandemic between roles that are sorted together.",

The depersonalization dimension of burnout, however, was found to rise consistently from one time point to the next. Burnout and psychological distress were consistently related to occupational role and were highest in nurses. Although emotional exhaustion improved as the case rate of COVID-19 decreased, rates of high emotional exhaustion remained much higher than was typically measured in hospital-based healthcare workers prior to the pandemic.",
