            "text": "The availability of safe blood is a key component of current medical practice. 1 Although use is decreasing, blood is transfused during 10% to 15% of all hospitalizations. 2 More than 16% of Medicare claims include blood. 2, 3, 4 In the United States, the blood supply is collected by a network of federally regulated but nongovernmental, independent, nonprofit organizations. This system has proved extraordinarily robust for more than 50 years. A decade of decreased blood use and changes in health care delivery have altered market conditions to place the sustainability of the current system at risk and made patient blood management (PBM) increasingly important and relevant. 5 It has now been shown that outcomes may be improved with more restrictive thresholds. 6 Striking a balance between adequate collection and supply is something that blood centers (BCs) and hospitals struggle with daily. Natural disasters such as Hurricane Katrina (2005) and pandemics such as severe acute respiratory syndrome 1 (2009) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2; 2019-20) affect donations and hospitals' use. This was not appreciated on September 11, 2001 , when the US government issued messages that prompted an immediate response by US blood donors. Even if 50 000 victims had been hospitalized, instead of the 200 who were admitted, more blood than was already available could not have been used immediately. Nevertheless, almost 500 000 units of blood were collected. 7 The American Red Cross normally discards 3% of its inventory but due to expiration in this case discarded 17% (49 860 units) of the 287 000 extra units collected. 8 During planned and unplanned disasters, the AABB Interorganizational Task Force on Domestic Disasters and Acts of Terrorism is available to assist the BC community with adequate blood supplies, keeping communication lines open, and updating transfusion services on changes to US Food and Drug Administration policy. 9 Many events have occurred since September 11, 2001 [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] (Table 1 ). Since that time, BCs have become more adept at addressing overcollections by requiring appointments, collecting only O-negative red blood cells (RBCs) or AB plasma, and using social media to tell the public that the most important donation needs to occur before the event. 12 Certain patients with medical conditions are transfusion dependent and will be most affected by disruption in the blood supply. Review of the literature is limited by a paucity of high-quality studies. Better-designed studies are warranted. 15 In its latest guidelines, AABB was unable to make a recommendation due to lack of evidence. 6 Regarding the topic of supply, this may include both predictable shortages during holidays and summer vacation when collections decrease and during unpredictable disasters. While surgery and procedures may not be canceled, delays in receiving blood may mean a patient has to stay in the hospital or clinic longer to await a needed procedure.",

This tremendous response to help others ran headlong into the limits of the blood supply systems to store, maintain, and use the donated blood. Thousands of donors were upset to read news reports that a large portion of the blood collected in this period had to be discarded.\" 17 As an industry, the blood community was not prepared to handle the large influx of donors and recognized the need to participate in and be better integrated into national disaster planning. Also identified was that emergency agencies and medical professionals outside of the blood community were unaware of the complexities of blood collection, processing, distribution, and storage; many had the misconception that large quantities of blood components were readily available at all times in hospitals. 18 In 2003, the AABB's Interorganizational Task Force on Domestic Disasters and Acts of Terrorism created the Disaster Operations Handbook, an online tool designed for BCs and hospitals to help prepare and respond to disasters and acts of terrorism that could affect the US blood supply. 19 The handbook highlights the importance of BCs reaching out to their local emergency medical agencies for blood management to be incorporated into the overall disaster plan. There are various ways to categorize a disaster in the blood community: There are disasters \"external to the BC,\" which could be due to natural phenomena such as hurricanes or flooding, or to human causes such as acts of terror or mass casualty events; or disasters \"within the BC\" that could cause acute loss in mass quantities of product, for example, from fire, flooding, or large-scale manufacturing failures. Depending on the disaster types, specific BC operations would be affected. For example, a major pandemic could greatly affect blood collections. Donors may not be able to donate due to illness, and employees may be too ill to work. A general fear of gathering in public spaces such as BCs may affect collections.

The AABB Task Force stresses the importance of this to quickly contact internal staff, the hospitals, emergency response organizations, and the AABB Task Force to coordinated national efforts. The AABB's Task Force Disaster Operations Handbook addresses different plans of action for sudden disasters such as mass casualty events or tornados as well as slow-moving disasters such as pandemics and can also help ensure media and public receive clear and consistent messaging regarding blood needs. 19 When disasters occur, the public often wants to help by donating blood. BCs in the local area of the disaster tend to get a large influx of donors. 6 This altruistic response provides little benefit to victims, as the amount of blood collected often greatly exceeds need. In the aftermath of 9/11, of the 500 000 units collected, only 260 units were used to treat victims. 7 Even when the need is acute, having blood flown to a disaster area can be more efficient than waiting for collected blood to be distributed. In addition, the donor surge can ironically compound the problem. 8 When the disaster has ended, there tend to be blood shortages, as \"everyone\" has already donated. Fortunately, the events of September 11, 2001 , resulted in an influx of first-time donors without a substantial increase in absolute risk of transfusion-transmissible viral infections. Unfortunately, first-time donor rates were relatively low before and after the attacks, suggesting that those donating in times of crisis have return behaviors similar to those of other firsttime donors. This was a good example of the need for education about the importance of donating regularly. 22 ",

Considering that SCD affects approximately 100 000 in the United States, while MDS prevalence ranges from 60 000 to 170 000, these conditions represent a sizeable population that is expected to grow as more active therapies develop and patients live longer. 23, 24 Transfusion support continues to be a mainstay therapy, and high proportions of these patients receive transfusions of RBCs, presenting a challenge to BCs to meet inventory needs. More than 40% of patients with MDS require regular RBC transfusions for supportive care. 25 Meanwhile, the rate of transfusion in patients with SCD is more nebulous, since many patients receive only sporadic RBC transfusions during more severe crises, though the incidence of some high-risk complications, particularly initial and recurrent stroke in children, have been found to be reduced by chronic transfusion therapy. 26, 27 There is evidence that the rate of RBC transfusion in adult patients with SCD has been increasing, as reported in a 10-year (2000-2009) study in a UK center, which noted that transfusion increased from 1.7 to 3.86 RBC units per patient per year and transfused patients increased from 15% to 19%. 28 Moreover, the most significant increase occurred in the latter half (2005-2009) of the study, which investigators attributed to increasing use of automated RBC exchange and increased transfusions for control of SCD complications. Since the UK study, guidelines and recommendations have been published aiming to better optimize therapy in SCD, including simple vs automated exchange transfusion and use of hydroxyurea. These guidelines favorably impacted the blood supply, especially antigen-matched RBCs and human leukocyte antigen-matched platelets without negatively impacting patient outcomes. [29] [30] [31] Provision of not only enough blood products for these patients but those that meet special requirements also presents unique challenges. Many institutions provide RBCs that are irradiated to prevent transfusion-associated graftvs-host disease, a severe and usually fatal complication in susceptible recipients, to their MDS patients (though not all guidelines support this recommendation). 32 Given that most institutions do not have the capacity to irradiate RBCs on site, owing to space and security limitations of maintaining an irradiator, irradiated blood must be specifically ordered and maintained in inventory. Due to higher cost and shortened shelf life associated with irradiated RBCs, many BCs maintain only a small portion of their inventory as irradiated product, which is typically weighted toward group O for compatibility with all blood types. This, in turn, leads to a skewed blood use distribution that is challenging for BCs.",

            "text": "Patients with SCD present other challenges, given that they have a higher rate of alloimmunization than other transfused patient populations, 18% to 37% vs 2% to 5%, respectively. 33 Many chronically transfused patients with SCD develop multiple alloantibodies, making it especially difficult to find compatible blood. Many hospital transfusion services have implemented policies for the prophylactic provision of antigen-matched RBCs to their patients with SCD to reduce alloimmunization. 33 Yet again, this presents unique challenges to BC facilities to provide RBCs that are phenotypically matched, largely because of genetic differences between the donor population (predominantly of European descent) vs patients with SCD (predominantly of African or Mediterranean descent). 34 Chronically transfused patients with \u03b2-thalassemia (predominantly of Mediterranean or Asian descent) also have high rates of alloimmunization, presenting additional challenges to provide compatible RBCs. 35 BCs are faced with the tendency of transfusion services to overuse group O blood to find units that are phenotypically matched for the extended antigen profile of their patients with SCD. There is an opportunity for BCs to work with their transfusion service customers to manage special requirements for patient transfusion needs with the best available product, including using type specific rather than group O. 36 Despite current PBM efforts, ensuring that the blood supply meets demand, particularly specialized products, remains a challenge. Furthermore, it is anticipated that blood supply demand will once again increase to meet the needs of the aging world populations that require more complex surgeries and cancer chemotherapy. 36 Finally, there are the logistics of managing chronically transfused patients in the outpatient setting. Patient populations include oncology patients and anemic patients with chronic renal disease. 37 As a result of the special product needs of these patients and the oftenencountered positive antibody screen results due to autoand/or alloantibodies, delays in crossmatching RBC units are common. Warm autoantibodies commonly found in this patient population can be vexing to finding compatible blood because of the specialized immunohematology testing that is required and the potential need for antigen-matched RBCs to avoid hemolytic reactions. Newly developed cancer immunotherapeutic agents, such as daratumumab (an anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody used for treatment of multiple myeloma), have been found to interfere with antibody testing, thus resulting in crossmatch delays. 38 Inventory supply shortages often also contribute to a delay in transfusing these patients in the outpatient setting.",

Little is known about inventory levels other than the National Blood Collection and Utilization Survey, which is published every 2 years, and the daily RBC inventory, which does not provide detailed numbers. The lack of a comprehensive hemovigilance system and the fragmented nature of the current system makes it difficult to really know if there is an adequate supply for a disaster. Public perceptions of the need for blood donation may not be realistic or what is needed to maintain appropriate inventory levels. Hospitals have an obligation to maintain an adequate blood supply to support patients. This means having enough inventory to not delay care or result in surgery cancellations, which increases patients' dissatisfaction and hospital costs, and not contribute to needless expiration and wastage of product. Collaboration of all parties would allow optimization of resources and improved patient care and ensure a sustained and adequate blood supply.",
