Overall, there are reported to be 0.49 mental health workers per 100 000 population. Bangladesh spends 1% of its GDP on health, of which 0.44% is spent on mental health. Insurance plans may not cover mental illness. 4, 5 In 2018, a new Mental Health Act was instituted in Bangladesh, replacing the Lunacy Act, which was more than a century old. This is a new Act and our understanding is that it is still to be fully implemented and the finer details will have to be clarified with time. It is generally viewed as an important step forward, but it has also been criticised for not going far enough in protecting the human rights of those with mental illness. Section 15 of the new Act allows for the admission of mentally disordered defendants or sentenced mentally disordered offenders under the direction of a magistrate, through the use of a 'reception order'. No further details are specified in the Act. The Act does not specify or take into consideration any variation of provision for offenders at different stages of their criminal justice proceedings. The inclusion of provisions on criminal liability for providing false mental illness certificates has also raised concern. If mental health professionals are proven to have deliberately provided a false certificate, then they may face prosecution, resulting in a fine or imprisonment. Critics fear that this could have the unintended consequence of reducing access to care, as practitioners may avoid mental health consultations for fear of being asked to provide certificates, thus exposing themselves to potential legal action. 6 We understand that the Prison Act is currently being revised to increase the emphasis on rehabilitation.",

This equates to 45 prisoners per 100 000, a similar level to Pakistan and India, and one of the lowest incarceration rates in the world. However, prison occupancy was 204% of capacity, indicating considerable overcrowding. In total, 3.9% of the prison population is female. There is one women-only prison in the country, located near Dhaka, and rest of the prisons have separate accommodation for men and women. Almost three-quarters of all prisoners (73.8%) were on remand, one of the highest ratios in the world, with many spending years awaiting trial. Of those convicted, 4905 prisoners had received a life sentence and 1204 were subject to the death sentence. Only 385 prisoners were considered 'mentally challenged' prisoners, with 7667 classified as 'addicted', although this is likely to be a considerable underestimate.

However, a systematic review of the prevalence in LMICs included several studies from India. Pooled estimates for the total sample of 14 527 prisoners in 13 LMICs suggest rates of non-affective psychosis around 16 times that of the general population, substance misuse and major depression 6 times as common and alcohol misuse twice as common. The authors conclude that these rates are likely to reflect unmet need, requiring specialist solutions tailored to resourcelimited settings. 8 The high prevalence of mental illness identified in this review parallels findings from high-income countries, suggesting that this is a global phenomenon. 9 Given the lack of published information, two of us (A.A.K. and T.P.) conducted telephone interviews with seven senior psychiatrists and a clinical psychologist in Bangladesh, identified through our professional networks. The interviewees were purposively selected to provide an accurate and comprehensive description of the current state of mental health services and practices in the country. All of the clinicians were based in leading national and regional mental health institutions that regularly offer assessment and treatment for mentally disordered offenders. Six of the psychiatrists worked for the government psychiatric service, one for a private medical university, and the clinical psychologist for a third-sector organisation. Five interviewees were based in the capital Dhaka and two in other districts. One psychiatrist (H.U.A.) and one psychologist (A.H.) interviewed are also authors of this review. Semi-structured interviews were used to determine the clinicians' knowledge and perception of mental health need in prisons and the provision of mental healthcare in prisons by resident professionals, from visiting psychiatrists and other specialists and following transfer to specialist hospitals. Additionally, interviewees were asked to add further information that they felt was relevant.",

Where there is no local teaching hospital, mentally disordered prisoners are transferred to a neighbouring district to access services.

In principle, prisoners can be admitted for evaluation at any point on the criminal justice pathway, although in practice admissions are brief and only for acute cases. Once treated or stabilised on medication, they are returned to prison, with provision for prescriptions to be continued in prison. On release from prison there is also provision for referral to hospital or an out-patient service, but there is no probation service and consequently no provision for community sentences.

These could be adapted from successful interventions used in other countries, especially similar LMICs, or developed de novo to fit the needs of the local population. This could draw on innovative technologies, such as digital approaches to delivering mental health interventions. 11 Interventions designed for use in resource-limited settings, such as psychological first aid and the World Health Organization's Mental Health Gap Action Programme (mhGAP), could be modified for use in the prison context. Raising awareness of mental illness and providing education on its identification, prevention and treatment could be targeted to both prison residents and staff. High levels of mental illness in the general population and limited community mental health services mean that imprisonment could be an opportunity to treat people who might otherwise not receive any support. A health economic evaluation could determine whether such interventions are ultimately cost-saving. The Department of Prisons could consider moving responsibility for mental healthcare to the health service. Improvements should ensure that the human rights of prisoners with mental illness are adequately protected.

            "text": "It is promising that the government's approach of responding to mental health needs only after the occurrence of a crisis has recently been replaced by the concept of total management through primary healthcare. There is a need for development of adequate infrastructure, logistics and workforce support, as well as establishment of multidisciplinary teams of management and clinical services. Collaboration of all related sectors of the government and an overall increase in government funding for mental health are essential.Bangladesh is a developing nation in South-East Asia that became a separate political and economic entity only 50 years ago. It was a part of the British Raj and then pre-Independence India until 1947, when it became an eastern province of Pakistan. Following its 'Great Liberation War' in 1971, the country became independent and was named Bangladesh.1 Covering 147 570 square kilometres on the Bay of Bengal, it borders India and Myanmar. The population of Bangladesh is roughly 163 million. The country has one of the highest population densities in the world, at 1102 people per square kilometre: 89% are Muslims, 10% are Hindu and 1% others; 38.2% of the population is urban; and migration from rural areas to urban centres is substantial and causes congestion and rapid construction. In the capital, Dhaka, the population is 21 million people and growing. 2 The GDP per capita is $4200, which indicates that Bangladesh is a lower middle-income economy. 3 Life expectancy is 74.2 years (133rd in the world), the maternal mortality rate is 173 per 100 000 live births and infant mortality is 28.3 per 1000 live births.2   There are only 0.53 physicians and 0.8 hospital beds per 1000 population. In rural districts, 'village doctors' with no formal training provide 65% of healthcare.Modern mental healthcare in Bangladesh is deficient owing to limited human and financial resources. Only 220 psychiatrists and about 50 trained clinical psychologists serve the whole nation.1 According to the World Health 1 National Institute of Mental Health, Dhaka, Bangladesh 2 School of Medicine and Bio-Medical Sciences, State University of New York At Buffalo, USA.
