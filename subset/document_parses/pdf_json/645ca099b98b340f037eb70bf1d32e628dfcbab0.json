            "text": "Purpose: The aim of this study was to evaluate whether or not living alone or together throughout the lockdown had an impact on mood, perceived immune fitness, as well as the presence and severity of COVID-19 symptoms. Methods: N = 505 participants completed an online survey, which included questions on living situations, as well as mood, perceived immune fitness and COVID-19 symptom presence and severity. These factors were assessed retrospectively for the time periods before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Results: An overall decrease in mood was observed for both those living alone and together during the lockdown period. However, significantly larger increases in feelings of loneliness were observed for the group living alone. Furthermore, both groups reported decreases in perceived immune fitness, whereas only the group living alone reported a significant increase in COVID-19 symptom presence and severity. Moreover, significant correlations were found between perceived immune fitness, anxiety, and loneliness. These correlations were strongest in the group living alone. Lastly, positive correlations were found between perceived immune fitness and mood outcomes with being active, optimistic and the ability to cope with stress. Increased optimism, being more active and the adequate ability to cope with stress were associated with a reduced negative impact on perceived immune fitness. Conclusion: The first COVID-19 lockdown period in the Netherlands was a challenging period for both people who lived alone and those living together, resulting in decreases in mood and poorer perceived immune fitness. Those living alone were, however, more heavily impacted by the lockdown restrictions. This was further reflected by the increased presence and severity of COVID-19 symptoms in people who lived alone during the first COVID-19 lockdown in The Netherlands.",

            "text": "On the 27th of January, the first 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID- 19) infection was reported in the Netherlands. Due to the contagious nature of the virus, many restrictions were implemented to reduce the spread of the disease. The first lockdown was instigated from the 15th of March until the 11th of May 2020. Closure of many establishments, such as schools, restaurants and theatres, was enforced, where possible people had to work from home, and it was advised to stay-at-home as much as possible. 1 Despite the effectiveness of measures aiming to control the spread of the virus, studies have shown that the COVID-19 pandemic and associated restrictions have had a great impact on mental health. 2 Following the onset of the pandemic, an overall pattern of increases in stress, loneliness and anxiety was observed. 3 This may be due to ambivalence about the course of the pandemic, and various related factors such as fear of infection, and economic uncertainty. 4, 5 Furthermore, feelings of loneliness may increase as social contact with other decreases. Feelings of disconnection and isolation from others due to lack of social contact can further aggravate decreases in mood, particularly feelings of loneliness, which is linked to feelings of anxiety, depression, and stress. [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] Literature reveals a large range of responses to the lockdown, and that it was not associated with the same level of negative mood effects for everyone. 5 For example, differential effects have been reported according to age and sex, as well as for other demographic variables. For instance, women as well as people under the age of 40 were found to have higher rates of anxiety than men and those above the age of 40. Furthermore, women were found to have higher levels of psychological distress, as well as being more vulnerable to stress. 8, [11] [12] [13] [14] Not only have studies shown that the pandemic has had negative effects on mental health but physical consequences have also been noted. Psychological stress can lead to the release of the corticotropin-releasing hormone, activating the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA)-axis. This results in increased levels of cortisol, the body's primary stress hormone. Increases in amounts hereof can trigger the development of stress-induced depression and anxiety. Although the body has a natural feedback mechanism, which uses cortisol to regulate its own production, it is found that social factors, such as social isolation and loneliness, can lead to glucocorticoid resistance, restricting the body's ability of maintaining this negative feedback system. 15, 16 Moreover, loneliness has also been associated with decreases in amounts of neutrophil to monocyte ratios as well as neutrophil to lymphocyte ratios. These effects have been observed to be in direct proportion to circulating cortisol levels, suggesting a relationship between stress and decreased immune functioning. 6 Loneliness plays a key role in both the mental and physical wellbeing of a person.",

Some parents were forced to work from home, as well as help their children with schoolwork, changing the nature of their parenting, and potentially placing unprecedented strain on parent-child relationships. 18 There are also several articles that highlight the benefits of living together during this period. An Italian study indicated that those living with children or their partners were more likely to experience positive emotions during the lockdown period. It further noted that increased interpersonal relationships with people living together had a positive effect on wellbeing. Bonds between people living together are important factors that modulate feelings of stress and other negative emotions. 21 Furthermore, those living with family members reported improved interaction and communication as well as improved conflict resolution and social support when facing stressful situations.

Social support has a stress-buffering effect and can alleviate feelings of depression, anxiety and distress, as well as being protective against feelings of loneliness. 10, 24 The current study investigated the impact of living alone or together during the first COVID-19 lockdown in the Netherlands. The study aimed to determine to what extent living alone or together had a differential effect on mood, perceived immune fitness and presence and severity of COVID-19 symptoms.",

            "text": "Our findings show a significant decrease in overall mood for both groups following the onset of the lockdown. We show increases in feelings of anxiety, depression, loneliness, fatigue and hostility -results which are consistent with the current literature on mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic. 2,10,21,31,32 These studies also found increased distress, anxiety, and depression during COVID-19, in particular in persons with poor coping strategies. 31, 32 These negative mental health effects have been reported for the general population as a whole, as well as for specific subpopulations such as pregnant women and adolescents. 33, 34 This indicates that the lockdown period has had serious effects on the mental health of many, irrespective of their living situation. However, the effects were much more pronounced in those living alone compared to people that lived together with others. Reasons for the observed mood changes may include anxiety and fear of COVID-19, as well as concerns about the wellbeing of others, such as friends or family members. 35 Economic reasons may also play a role, such as worries or stress about unemployment rates and economic uncertainty. 18 Furthermore, results indicate that people were less active during the lockdown period. Other studies previously found that a more sedentary lifestyle, together with reduced social opportunities, may contribute to people spending more time in bed and having poorer sleep quality, which may also impact mood. 36 Interestingly, loneliness increased for both groups. This suggests that the feeling of being lonely may not be wholly dependent on social connectedness but also contain a psychological component. Despite living together, one may still feel isolated from other people, and perhaps some may lack their usual social support from people they are not residing with, and therefore feeling disconnected from (the social side of) normal life. Additionally, poor family/ relationship functioning may also contribute to loneliness, despite being surrounded by them. 3 In line with other studies, we found that loneliness was associated with reduced feelings of happiness, increased ratings of depression and stress, and a decreased quality of life. 3, 6 Results indicate that despite both groups experiencing increases in feelings of loneliness, those living alone have significantly larger increases in these feelings compared to those living together. The implementation of various restrictions, such as the limited number of guests allowed to visit one's home and advised stay-at-home orders, may have been particularly difficult for those living alone as this naturally hinders physical social interactions. For these people, contact with others may be made through various social media platforms. Despite the availability thereof, one study conducted in the United States noted that contact via the phone did not prove to have significant positive effects. In fact, results highlighted that contact via the phone may even increase feelings of loneliness as it can remind someone that they are alone. This emphasizes the importance of physical interaction for one's emotional wellbeing. 37 However, this study only looked at the effects of telephone contact, and not at contact via other forms of social media. Nevertheless, the above-mentioned points suggest that those living alone may be particularly reliant on others for social interaction and support, therefore ",

Also, negative correlations of perceived immune fitness with anxiety and loneliness were significantly stronger for those living alone. Numerous studies have shown that there are reliable correlations between feelings of loneliness and psychological symptoms, such as anxiety, depression, and stress. Moreover, feelings of loneliness may not only be a consequence of stress but also act as a cause, creating a vicious cycle. It has been found that these psychological effects can negatively impact immune fitness, as it leads to activation of the HPA-axis, increasing levels of cortisol. As social factors, such as social isolation and loneliness, can lead to glucocorticoid resistance, this removes the natural break-mechanism of cortisol production, further aggravating levels of stress, as well as stressinduced depression and anxiety. Moreover, loneliness has been associated with decreases in the number of immune cells, especially decreases in the ratios of neutrophil to monocyte and neutrophil to lymphocyte ratios. These decreases have been observed in direct proportion to circulating cortisol ratios, supporting earlier research claiming a relationship between stress and a decrease in immune functioning. For this reason, those living alone and experiencing greater rates of loneliness and anxiety may report larger increases in COVID-19 related symptoms. 3, 6, 10, 13 Decreases in perceived immune fitness may be the result of an overall decrease in mood. 36 As mentioned, social support can be protective against feelings of loneliness, leading to decreases in feelings of stress and anxiety. 38 As no effect was seen on COVID-19 symptom severity and presence for those living together, this may suggest that the overall effect of social support may weigh heavier on one's wellbeing than overall mood. Therefore, social support resulting from living together with others may play a fundamental role in regulating mood and perceived immune fitness, highlighting the importance of social support in one's surroundings.",

            "text": "Our data show positive correlations for both groups between being active, optimistic, being able to cope with stress and improved perceived immune fitness, indicating these assets have a beneficial effect for someone's health. Physical exercise is known to play a key role in regulating the immune system and reducing inflammatory markers in the body. Mechanisms may include stimulation of various immune cells, such as neutrophils and cytokines immunoglobulins, resulting in greater ability for the immune system to react to pathogens. Therefore, exercise may improve immune fitness and can potentially help to decrease the likelihood of acquiring the COVID-19 virus. 39, 40 On the contrary, research has shown that those having developed a more sedentary lifestyle due to the pandemic can increase susceptibility to infections. Additionally, physical activity has been shown to reduce feelings of anxiety, depression, and stress, perhaps contributing to overall optimism and ability to cope with stress. 39 Several limitations of the current study should be considered. First, the current study relied on retrospective survey data, which may be subject to recall bias, and could perhaps be subject to either over-or underestimating feelings accompanying lockdown. This could potentially have had an impact on the accuracy of the data. Secondly, perceived immune fitness was assessed using a subjective rating scale, and while this method has been used in other studies, it is possible that the subjective perception of immune fitness may be different from objective biomarker assessments (eg, cytokines). In this context, it is also relevant to mention that individuals may differ in health (risk) perception and the involvement of sensory perception in emotional processes. Several factors may influence perception, including alexithymia. 41 Research in the context of COVID-19 revealed that risk perception plays an important role in determining to what extent mental health is affected during the COVID-19 pandemic, 42 whereas another study revealed that the factors, age, sex, and marital status, were significant predictors of the perceived risk of getting a disease caused by a novel virus. 43 The COVID-19 symptoms scale used was created at the beginning of the lockdown period in the Netherlands in 2020 and since then, the Dutch National Institute for Public Health and Environment (RIVM) has included additional symptoms to the list of COVID-19 symptoms. As such, these symptoms were not included in our scale and must be included in further research. Additionally, not all respondents have been tested for COVID-19, and therefore it is unknown whether this subsample has been previously infected with COVID-19. Thus, although there was a significant correlation between living alone and COVID-19 symptoms, further research should be done to confirm these findings. Moreover, since this study was cross-sectional and no longitudinal follow-up has been conducted yet, it is not possible to compare the collected data with that of the following summer period (without lockdown), and second lockdown period (November 2020 -April 2021) that followed. Long-term effects of the pandemic resulting from living together or alone may be crucial to determine the overall effects the pandemic has had on individuals, as well as being useful for the future. It may be possible that certain effects may not be sustained over time, or alternatively, that the effects will be much more pronounced for the second lockdown, which was of longer duration. Finally, participants were recruited via Facebook, limiting respondents to those with an internet connection and a Facebook account. Furthermore, more women responded than men to the survey, and the majority of the sample did not live alone during the lockdown. For the above-mentioned reasons, it is unclear to what extent the results of the survey are representative of the entire Dutch population.",
