Public health interventions, such as social distancing could help to protect many vulnerable people and reduce secondary transmissions within the community. This research was undertaken as a longitudinal study to identify and comprehend the preferences given to different preventive measures adopted by individuals to ensure protection against the spread of coronavirus. An online survey was conducted with a representative sample of 176 stakeholders to identify practices and behaviour adopted by the key stakeholders working in the domains of water, health and disaster risk reduction to curb the spread of COVID-19 in Delhi-National Capital Territory of India (Delhi-NCT). Findings of this study shown preferred willingness to adopt sanitisation measures, often by cleaning their hands with soap and water, and restricting any movement inside and outside of the house. Three-fourth of the respondents considered washing their hands after returning from outside an important measure to limit the spread of the disease. Moreover, two-third of the people stopped ordering food from outside as a prevention strategy. Furthermore, only about 36% of the respondents showed interest in stocking up on grocery items as their most preferred choice, reflecting that this was considered to be the least important of all choices. Research outcomes of this study will help policymakers to better understand mitigation options that are used in the early and later stages of the lockdown to improve resilience from such viruses. Further, it will assist decision-makers to understand the range of individual-level practices adopted by stakeholders to mitigate disease transmission at the community level and inform the government's planning efforts in the future.",

The situation demanded, \"a coordinated international response\" [5, 6] owing to the exponential increase in the number of COVID-19 cases to a whopping 9809 with Russia, Spain, Sweden, the United Kingdom, India and Philippines confirming their first case by the end of January 2020. It was only the sixth such declaration made by WHO [7] . The increase in the number of disease outbreaks such as COVID-19 demands enhancing the capacity of individuals and communities to respond globally by adopting wide-ranging approaches including risk reduction measures such as social distancing, following government advisories, adopting sanitisation measures etc. However, limited research has paid attention to such practices adopted by individuals from the perspective of risk reduction strategy.",

Community mitigation strategies, such as social distancing, can slow down virus transmission in schools and surrounding communities. This helps to relieve the pressure on overburdened healthcare and public health systems and buy time for the production and distribution of vaccines [10] . Public health interventions such as distancing adopted at an individual and community level could potentially act as a risk reduction measure to limit the transmission within the community during disease outbreaks [11] .

Every case found was contained by vaccination of all immediate family members, making India free of smallpox by April 1977. In September 1994, pneumonic plague deaths were reported in Western India. The disease got transmitted to other parts of India by the migrant workers through a pattern of spread called relocation diffusion, explaining the presence of plague in far off areas. Timely containment and hospitalisation led to successful containment of the disease.

Measures such as screening of incoming air passengers at 30 airports, 12 major and 54 minor ports and even at land borders followed by suspension of visas and ban on international flights, were taken much ahead of any other country. Thermal screening of international travellers from China and Hong Kong started on January 18, 12 days before the first case of coronavirus was even detected in India (January 30). The government took some proactive measures (as shown in Table 3 ) to contain the disease and regularly requested states to maintain and enhance their surveillance systems to ensure complete coverage without any gaps. The Prime Minister of India requested all citizens to observe a nationwide public-curfew (Janta curfew) on March 22 followed by a nationwide lockdown for 21 days, 2 months after the global outbreak; to stop the spread of highly-contagious COVID-19 through any kind of movement by asking people to stay at home and observe social distancing. Such a comprehensive response system put in place by the Government of India triggered a major crisis for millions of stranded inter and intrastate migrants and daily wage workers, with challenges of access to food and necessities during the lockdown.

Public health policy focused primarily on reducing and preventing the spread of infection by prompt and decisive actions such as announcing a prompt ban on travel and border sealing. Free testing and treatment of COVID-19 under Ayushman Bharat, enabling state health services to have their health facilities, having medical equipment and supplies in place to manage the anticipated increase in cases, etc. were some of the measures taken by the Indian government to tackle the pandemic. Furthermore, the central, state and district administration accelerated their public health response through effective engagement in partnerships and collaborations and ensuring a smooth process for providing necessary approvals by integrating the Information and Communications Technology (ICT) network.",

According to Ref. [16] ; over 100 countries worldwide imposed either a full or partial lockdown by the end of March 2020. Some Asian countries like China, Japan opted for lockdown with strict freedom limiting whereas in contrast, countries such as the United States (U.S.) and Brazil, adopted a relaxed social distancing approach, suffering more from the pandemic [17, 18] . The likely contributing factor for this is that people have varied risk perceptions and viewpoints towards the pandemic resulting from differences in cultural backgrounds across countries. Further, the WHO recommended 1 m of physical distancing for effective social distancing has been followed by countries such as China, France, Hong Kong, Singapore but countries such as US, Australia, and the UK adopted varying physical distancing rules. These differences emerge in strategies adopted across the world owing to differences in perception regarding the potential distance over which COVID-19 can be transmitted [17] .",

Social distancing has been defined by Streit et al.

Possible large-scale measures include avoiding crowds, cancelling events attracting large crowds, limiting large gatherings, closure of public spaces like schools, universities, places of worship, theatres, malls offices, mass transit systems, enforcing closures/complete lockdown of cities etc. [23] . Individual-level measures involve teleconferencing instead of in-person work meetings and more extreme steps like self-quarantine i.e. staying home, not welcoming others to one's home, avoiding going out of the house, washing hands, staying home if sick etc. This strategy has played a significant role in mitigating earlier pandemics such as the one caused by the Spanish Flu of 1918-19 and it continues to play a significant role in current plans for pandemic preparedness and applicability [8, [24] [25] [26] . These measures act as a means of reducing transmission and delaying spread (Mahtani and Carl, 2020) by providing a community the critical time needed to prepare and enhance the capacity of health infrastructure and by helping to achieve the critical goal of \"flattening the curve,\" i.e. reducing the peak number of cases at any one time during the outbreak of the disease. Several social distancing strategies, including city-wide lockdowns, screening measures at railway stations and airports, active case finding, and isolation of suspected cases, appear to have slowed down the transmission of COVID-19 outside of the Hubei province [27] . Besides the timing and duration of social distancing measures to contain the outbreaks (Mahtani et al., 2020), individual level practices act as a contributing factor in delaying the spread of pandemics.",

An almost equal number of people at 73% and 72% believed that carrying their own bags for shopping and keeping a sanitiser along with them were imperative when going out of the house. According to 66-67% of the respondents, wearing a mask, using gloves and cleaning all things brought from outside were considered as significant social distancing measures for reducing the probability of getting and spreading the infection. Masks allow people to implement social distancing in a safe way and also provide an overall distance boost. Usage of masks should be always recommended to everyone, in spite of their protection effectiveness (Pauli et al., 2012) . According to a cross-sectional online survey conducted by Yanti et al.

Around 61% of respondents supported not touching themselves or anything around them, when they could afford to, as an important means to protect them from the contagious disease.

Only about 26% of them went on a cleaning spree of their house, wardrobes etc. Surprisingly, only 7-8% of sampled respondents stated that they spent time with their families or indulged in pursuing their hobbies such as reading, cooking, gardening etc. Some studies point out that increasing obesity, accidental pregnancies, and other health risks (Bourassa et al., 2020; Schiavi et al., 2020) may increase due to reduced movement of people and changes in people's conventional health behaviours. The data reflects that since people have never faced such a situation before, they seem to be confused in their mind about what is impacting them more and what to pursue in days to come. They seemed more interested in watching TV over spending quality time with their family or doing household chores. A recent study, Ammar et al. [34] ; utilised the short version of the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (Lee et al., 2011), reporting These social and preventive health measures act as a means of reducing contact and thus, in slowing down the transmission of COVID-19, by providing a community the critical time needed to prepare and enhance the capacity of the health infrastructure (Mahtani and Carl, 2020). This is critical in order to achieve the goal of flattening the curve i.e., to reduce the peak number of cases at any one time during the outbreak of the disease. Several social and preventive health measures such as a complete lockdown, screening measures, active testing, and isolation of suspected cases, have slowed down the transmission of COVID-19 in China [27] .",

Previous studies have highlighted risk perception as a leading indicator of protective behaviours (Barrios et al., 2020; Lin and Lagoe, 2013; Dionne et al., 2018) adopted by people. People need to be encouraged to have a risk perception that helps them identify infection and health-related risks related to unprotected behaviours during the pandemic. However, limited research has investigated preventive measures adopted by individuals to maintain social distancing and to safeguard themselves and their families against the virus. By examining preventive measures, perceived understanding, and social distancing across the selected stakeholders in Delhi-NCT, this study addresses how strategies can be formulated using identified individuals' physical distancing behaviours to combat future outbreaks.",

Based on the data collected from an online survey conducted among 176 participants throughout April 2020, the analysis indicates that people adopted different preventive measures to protect themselves from the threat of COVID-19 infection. Out of many preventive measures, 78% of people preferred that there should be restricted entry of outsiders and 82% preferred to wash or clean hands with soap and water to reduce the spread of COVID-19. A large portion of people (82%) also opted to stop ordering food from outside as an effective preventive strategy to curb the spread.",

            "text": "Around 60% of the respondents considered not going out of the house and leaving couriers untouched outside the house for a few hours before getting them inside as an important measure of maintaining social distance. Many respondents (67-66%) felt that wearing a mask and using gloves and cleaning all things brought from outside were significant social distancing measures that helped in reducing the probability of getting and spreading the infection. Almost 61% of respondents supported not touching themselves or anything around them to protect themselves from the contagious disease. Taking shower after returning from outside was the least preferred option for individuals. Hence, effective strategies for risk reduction against future outbreaks need to incorporate perceived understanding, individual behaviour adopted, and preferences assigned to mitigate risks. Finally, these results are expected to contribute to development of guidelines based on individual behaviour as well as to assist with the effective implementation of the social distancing policies in future outbreaks. Similar to Marchiori [44] ; as a part of an effective strategy to combat the threat of another outbreak, this study suggests the need to formulate awareness campaigns and intervention programs focusing not on just limiting mobility, asking people to stay at home and sharing social distancing rules, but also to focus on the behavioural issues and the dangerous paradox lying within human's innate social nature. This should be done to strengthen society's resilience to pandemics especially of the vulnerable people at risk or those with comorbidities. Several studies analysing the effects of the pandemic induced lockdown on the health of different groups have been undertaken, reflecting that lockdown and restrictions imposed by the government could also have negative short and long-term psychological effects as they can exacerbate feelings of isolation, loneliness, stress and anxiety [15] . Such impacts are even more severe in the case of longer quarantines with the likelihood of people falling prey to behavioural fatigue [45] . The findings are of general interest in future pandemic situations, given the general nature of the social distancing paradox.",

The findings also reflect that the pandemic has had its positives as well, by helping many people develop/ enhance their hygiene-related habits like cleaning their hands more frequently than before. Further, emphasis on handwashing will not only stop coronavirus spread but many other illnesses due to the development of good hygiene practices. Coughing or sneezing in a handkerchief will curb the spread of not just COVID-19 but also many other diseases such as tuberculosis, influenza and other seasonal flus. Social distancing and stoppage of spitting in public places will also stop the spread of TB, H1N1, influenza, etc.",

Once the pandemic ends, studies should reevaluate the adoption of preventive measures by individuals during the pandemic and their sustainability in the long run, especially of hygiene practices.",
