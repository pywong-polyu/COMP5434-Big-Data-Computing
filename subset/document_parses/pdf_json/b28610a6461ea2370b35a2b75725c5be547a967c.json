In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, primary care networks (PCNs) within Central Alberta partnered with a technology provider to rapidly implement home health monitoring (HHM) for patients with chronic diseases. In the 37 patients evaluated in phase 1 (90 days), diabetes was most common (73%), followed by hypertension (38%), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (27%), and heart failure (11%). Overall, patients were comfortable using the HHM technology, and >60% reported improved quality of life after follow-up. Patients also made fewer visits to their family physician/emergency department compared with the preenrolment period. In January 2021, the HHM initiative was expanded to a larger patient cohort (phase 2; n = 500). Interim results for 90 patients from eight PCNs up to the end of May 2021 show similar findings to phase 1.",

In the primary care setting, routine care for patients with chronic diseases is provided by family physicians, often supported by primary care networks (PCNs), but virtual healthcare delivery is, to our knowledge, uncommon. Reports of virtual healthcare initiatives in Canada come primarily from secondary care settings (eg, studies in which patients are followed up remotely after acute hospital care). [2] [3] [4] To explore the feasibility of delivering virtual healthcare within the primary care setting, a multiparty collaboration came together to deliver home health monitoring (HHM) to patients with chronic conditions in Alberta's Central Zone, a largely rural area with a population of over 450,000. 5 The expansive geography of Central Alberta presents many barriers to optimal care, such as limited resources and access issues (distance, cost, weather, and ability to drive). Furthermore, patients in Alberta's Central Zone have higher rates of most chronic conditions compared with the rest of the province, 6 with 30-40% more Emergency Department (ED) visits than the average Albertan and higher unplanned hospital readmission rates at both 7 and 30 days after discharge. 7 As such, this vast geographic area was the ideal setting in which to implement this pilot feasibility study.",

Respondents acknowledged the utility of the HHM system, reporting that the system allowed them to monitor trends easily, as well as motivating patients to engage with their own care. However, a busy workload was overwhelmingly reported as the key barrier to successful engagement with the system, with some nurses reporting a need for more ongoing training and support. Overall, these results should be interpreted with caution due to the very small sample size. A fuller assessment of provider experience will be possible at the end of phase 2.",

Our program allowed the monitoring of patients from their home, educating and empowering them to confidently manage their conditions at an early stage, which has the potential to reduce their long-term impact on the health system.",

            "text": "Three essential lessons have been learned from our experience so far. The first is that clear guidelines on inclusion/exclusion criteria should be provided to HHM providers to ensure maximum inclusion and reduce the barriers to entry for patients with chronic diseases. Without ensuring equity, the implementation of telemedicine may increase disparities in healthcare access for vulnerable populations with limited digital access or literacy, such as rural residents, racial/ethnic minorities, and older adults. 10 The second learning was the need for implementation of increased management support for the providers. The nurses' experiences in both phase 1 and phase 2 highlighted the importance of thorough hands-on training for providers and patients. The provider experience is an important consideration in any new healthcare initiative. To be successful, intervention and ongoing support are required to ensure integration of telehealth into existing clinical practice and the development of new procedures and protocols. 11 The third learning was the need to identify and address potential barriers highlighted in phase 1 that can be circumvented in phase 2. As a result of a low rate of completion of the EQ-5D-5L quality of life assessment in phase 1, phase 2 now includes the EQ-5D-5L tool within the HHM platform itself to support completion in a much larger patient cohort. Phase 1 results do not include robust analysis of the impacts on the broader health system; however, at the end of phase 2, the impact of HHM on health system utilization will be assessed. Phase 2 will also investigate outcomes for individual conditions, as doing so may enable a stronger analysis of HHM efficacy.",
