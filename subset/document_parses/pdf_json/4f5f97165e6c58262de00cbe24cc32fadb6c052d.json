This study aimed to develop and validate a novel prediction model of COVID-19 progression. Methods: In total, 814 patients in the training set were included to develop a novel scoring system; and 420 patients in the validation set were included to validate the model. Results: A prediction score, called ACCCDL, was developed on the basis of six risk factors associated with COVID-19 progression: age, comorbidity, CD4 ? T cell count, C-reactive protein (CRP), D-dimer, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). For predicting COVID-19 progression, the ACCCDL score yielded a significantly higher area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) compared with the CALL score, CoLACD score, PH-COVID-19 score, neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio, and lymphocyte-monocyte ratio both in the training set (0.92, 0.84, 0.83, 0.83, 0.76, and 0.65, respectively) and in the validation set (0.97, 0.83, 0.83, 0.78, 0.74, and 0.60, respectively). Over 99% of patients with the ACCCDL score \\ 12 points will not progress to severe cases, and over 30% of patients with the ACCCDL score [ 20 points will progress to severe cases. Conclusion: The ACCCDL score could stratify patients with at risk of COVID-19 progression, and was useful in regulating the large flow of patients with COVID-19 between primary health care and tertiary centers.",

Diminished volumes of habitual physical activity and increased sedentary levels have been observed as a result of COVID-19 home confinement [3] . A worldwide multicenter study elucidates the risk of psychosocial strain during the early COVID-19 home confinement period in 2020 [4] . The results of the ECLB-COVID19 international online survey also show that isolation alters physical activity and eating behaviors in a health-compromising direction [5] . Consequences of inactivity, including a higher mortality rate and poorer general health and fitness, have been reported. In order to mitigate the negative psychosocial effects of home confinement, implementation of national strategies focused on promoting social inclusion through a technology-based solution is strongly suggested [4] . The insight from the ECLB-COVID19 multicenter study provides a clear remit for the urgent implementation of technology-based intervention to foster an Active and Healthy Confinement Lifestyle [6] . Souissi et al. also suggest combining video feedback with pedagogical activity during the pandemic-induced online coaching or physical education to improve movement learning in school-aged children [7] .",

Richardson et al. included 5700 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in New York, and reported that 373 patients (14.2%) were severe cases that required treatment in the intensive care unit (ICU) [8] . In a report of 72,314 cases in China, 14% were severe cases that required ventilation in the ICU [9] . The risk factors of COVID-19 progression have been reported, and broadly include older age [10] , comorbidity [11] , C-reactive protein (CRP) [12] , CD4 ? T cell count [13] , D-dimer, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) [14] , leukocyte count, lymphocyte count, procalcitonin, and so on [15] . Prediction models, which combine multiple risk factors to estimate the risk of COVID-19 progression, could help physicians to decide which patients can be treated at primary health care centers and who needs transfer to tertiary centers. Some prediction models for early identification of patients with risk of COVID-19 progression have been reported in previous studies [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] . However, most of the existing prediction models lack validation, are inadequately reported, or are at high risk of bias. Thus, it is not a surprise to see different results from different models. Few existing prediction models have the potential to be extensively used by healthcare providers.",

The ACCCDL score ranges from 6 points In this study, two cutoff points were reported for the ACCCDL score. A high cutoff (20 points) with high specificity and PPV is used to rule in progress to severe COVID-19, and can benefit from early transfer to tertiary centers. The ACCCDL score has several attractive features. First, it is inexpensive and very easily calculated, which makes it easier to use. Second, compared with previously reported prediction models, the ACCCDL score provides higher prediction performance and more accurate evaluation for the risk of COVID-19 progression.

In the study by Ji et al., the CALL score could identify patients who had low risk of COVID-19 progression with an AUROC of 0.91 (95% CI 0.86-0.94) [16] . However, in another study of 210 patients with COVID-19, Grifoni et al. reported the opposite conclusion that the power of the CALL score for predicting progression to severe COVID-19 was low with an AUROC of 0.62 (95% CI 0.53-0.69) [23] . The two studies had relatively small samples and come to the opposite conclusion. Other external validations are needed to further validate the prediction performance of the CALL score. In this large sample study, we found that the power of the CALL score for predicting progression to severe COVID-19 was high with an AUROC of 0.84 (95% CI 0.81-0.87) in the training set and an AUROC of 0.83 (95% CI 0.79-0.87) in the validation set.

T cell count, CRP, and D-dimer levels and this might improve the sensitivity and the specificity. Previous studies also had reported that CD4 ? T cell count, CRP, and D-dimer levels could help clinicians to identify patients with COVID-19 progression [12] [13] [14] . Second, compared with the CALL score which just considers whether patients have comorbidity (without, 1 point; with, 4 point), the ACCCDL score includes the [26] . This study has some limitations. First, this study is a single-center study. Second, the retrospective design might have caused selection bias [27] . Therefore, the ACCCDL score needs to be externally validated in a prospective study to confirm its prediction reliability. Third, in our cohort, the majority of patients with COVID-19 (more than 70%) were imported cases, which mainly included overseas students and business people. Generally, the overseas students and business people are young and had low risk of comorbidity. Therefore, in this study, both the training set and validation set included \\ 15% of 60 years old patients, \\ 20% had more than one comorbidity. The diagnostic performance of the ACCCDL score deserves to be validated in a cohort with more patients who have older age and more common comorbidity, which might strengthen the results of this study. Fourth, the ACCCDL score was not evaluated using patients with negative RT-PCR and a high clinical suspicion of COVID-19 because in Shanghai, China, our hospital is the only designated hospital for confirmed adult patients with COVID-19. All patients were confirmed by the positive results of SARS-CoV-2 nucleotide tests before they were transferred to our hospital.",
