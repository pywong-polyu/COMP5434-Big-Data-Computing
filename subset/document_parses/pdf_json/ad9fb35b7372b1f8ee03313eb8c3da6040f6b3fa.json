Dentists in this region have incorporated several changes to their practices to help minimize risks of person-to-person transmission inside dental offices. is narrative review aimed to provide an in-depth overview of the current situation in the Southeast Asian region regarding the use of teledentistry during the pandemic. Teledentistry involves the transfer of patient information across remote distances for online consultation and treatment planning. A few years back, it used to be a lesser-known entity but has seen an exponential rise in its incorporation into dental practices all around the Association of Southeast Nations (ASEAN) region. Many clinics in the Southeast Asian region have started using online consultations to ensure that patients can be diagnosed or followed up during their treatment. Teledentistry is the clear answer in the coming months as it will help reduce the risk of virus transmission and help patients get access to oral healthcare and dentists to see their patients. is article reviews the current pandemic situation in the ASEAN region, the recent evidence, and the scope of teledentistry. It also provides recommendations for the future and sheds light on the different types of teledentistry and how it can be incorporated into practices by regulatory authorities in this region.",

While the Southeast Asian region has seen a lesser incidence of COVID-19 than the developing countries, many countries have gone into lockdown again in the past few months because of rising new cases [1] . Several measures have been implemented in this region to aid in the containment of the virus, including lockdowns, travel restrictions across borders, and the advocacy of different safety protocols depending on the geographical location. In the Southeast Asian region, various policies have been advocated by health regulatory bodies that entail measures such as the use of protective face masks and gloves and maintaining distance in public areas, all of which are aimed at helping to reverse the growth rate of the virus [2] . Among these measures, the use of virtual dentistry, or teledentistry as we call it, has been rising during this period. e Southeast Asian region, as we know, includes three groups of countries: the lower-middleincome, upper-middle-income, and the high-income group of countries. e lower-middle-income group is formed by Indonesia, Cambodia, Sri Lanka, the Philippines, and Vietnam. e upper-middle-income group comprises Malaysia and ailand, while Singapore has been placed in the high-income group of countries (Tables 1 and 2) [3, 4] .",

It has been shown in previous studies conducted in the Association of Southeast Nations (ASEAN) region that people who received treatment for severe dental problems were forced to reduce expenses on necessities because of the additional costs incurred [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] .

Previous studies have analyzed the cost-benefit ratio across patients located in rural areas and found teledentistry to be a financially cost-effective option. Virtual dentistry has also been demonstrated to be helpful when it comes to remote screening for oral lesions, oral health education programs, and virtual consultations in remote rural areas [24] . In Latin America, Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) is considered a part of dental health provision and has been highly efficient in educational programs and research [25, 26] . e major problem faced by developing countries in using teledentistry has been attributed to many factors such as shortage of infrastructure, insufficient resources, materials, and even the conservative thought process of the governing bodies [27] . During the past year, many concerns have arisen regarding the risk of cross infection from patients visiting dental clinics for treatment. Governing bodies have set down various guidelines to prevent the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus [28] [29] [30] . Some of the recommendations include patient screening at the clinic entrance, telephonic screening before the patient visit, recording the patient's recent travel history to infection hotspots, and even the use of virtual consultations to alleviate patient concerns [31] .",

Patients have been asked to complete additional travel and medical history forms concerning the viral infection and its symptoms. At-risk patients are identified at the entry and requested to postpone any elective treatments for 14 days, while asymptomatic patients who clear screening are allowed inside with their masks on at all points of time except when receiving treatment [34] . Respirators such as N95 and four-layered masks have been used in conjunction with clear face shields to reduce transmission risk during treatment. After treatment, the clinical area is cleaned, sterilized, and subject to UV lamp disinfection for half an hour. While dentists have been as worried as the public about the infection risks, their experience and added safety approaches have brought about an air of confidence towards infection control.",
