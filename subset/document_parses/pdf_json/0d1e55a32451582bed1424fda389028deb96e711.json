            "text": "Several challenging biological sensing concepts have been realized using electrolyte-gated reduced graphene oxide field effect transistors (rGO-FETs). In this work, we demonstrate the interest of rGO-FET for the sensing of human papillomavirus (HPV), one of the most common sexually transmitted viruses and a necessary factor for cervical carcinogenesis. The highly sensitive and selective detection of the HPV-16 E7 protein relies on the attractive semiconducting characteristics of pyrene-modified rGO functionalized with RNA aptamer Sc5-c3. The aptamer-functionalized rGO-FET allows for monitoring the aptamer-HPV-16 E7 protein binding in real time with a detection limit of about 100 pg mL \u22121 (1.75 nM) for HPV-16 E7 from five blank noise signals (95% confidence level). The feasibility of this method for clinical application in point-of-care technology is evaluated using HPV-16 E7 protein suspended in saliva and demonstrates the successful fabrication of a promising field effect transistor biosensor for HPV diagnosis.",

            "text": "The development of a field effect transistor (FET), allowing signal enhancement of biological binding events with an applied electric field, is a lab-on-a-chip approach with short assay times down to seconds in the best cases [1] [2] [3] [4] . It represents an attractive sensing platform due to its fast response time, ease to use, possibility of miniaturization together with sensitive and selective detection. Selective sensing is achieved by anchoring specific probes on the conducting rGO channel of the transistor, which remains a critical factor for FET sensor performance, of particular importance when used as a biosensor. The golden standard of viral detection in clinical settings remains the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or the advanced quantitative real-time reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) [5, 6] . The typical turnaround time for screening and diagnosing patients is > 24 h. Additional drawback is the fact that the positive rate of qRT-PCR assays is often reported to vary from 30 to 60%. Therefore, more accurate and sensitive methods are urgently needed to support the quality assurance of the qRT-PCR. In order to be applicable for viral infection diagnosis, the FET biosensor should have a sensitivity close to that of PCR, a lower per-test cost, and minimum investment in the necessary laboratory hardware. For these reasons, graphenebased FET sensors for viral infection screening are still at their early phase of development [4, [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] . The use of rGO-based FET for the evaluation of Ebola glycoproteins suspended in Published in the topical collection 2D Nanomaterials for Electroanalysis with guest editor Sabine Szunerits. human serum and plasma with a sensitivity down to 1 ng mL \u22121 was reported by Chen et al. [4] . The rapid detection of COVID-19 causative virus in the human nasopharynx was just reported on a graphene field effect transistor [11] . The sensor was produced by coating graphene sheets of the FET with specific antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 spike protein.",

Our group has recently demonstrated the interest of aptamer-modified electrodes for the sensitive and selective detection of the E7 major capsid protein of human papillomavirus (HPV) [17] .

While chemical vapordeposited graphene (CVD graphene) allows for the exact material positioning of high-quality graphene with little defects [23] , the advantage of using liquid-dispersed graphene oxide (GO) flakes facilitates the fabrication but comes with the disadvantage of a practically random and uncontrolled distribution of the GO flakes, resulting in random localization during the adsorption from the liquid onto the gate surface.

The dimensions of the IDE chip are 6 mm in width and 10 mm in length, with a circular sensing area of 3 mm in diameter. The rGO sheets, obtained by sequential GO transfer and 4-h hydrazine reduction [3] , followed by thermal annealing, were further characterized by Raman microscopy.
