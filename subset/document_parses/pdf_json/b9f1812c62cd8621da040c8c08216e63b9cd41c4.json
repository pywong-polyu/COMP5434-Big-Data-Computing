The incidence of COVID-19 among children and adolescents is also lower than that among adults, potentially due to multiple factors, such as different exposure patterns and gene expression profiles (2, 3) . In seasonal and pandemic influenza, children and adolescents play a major role in spreading the virus in the community; therefore, school closures are effective in suppressing influenza transmission (4, 5) . Conversely, their role in spreading COVID-19 in the community is not fully understood due to the limited information about secondary transmission generated by them (6) (7) (8) . In this study, we aimed to reveal the secondary transmission rate of pediatric and adolescent cases with COVID-19 in various settings and their role in transmission dynamics in the community.",

In Japan, it is mandatory to report every confirmed COVID-19 case, who were diagnosed by validated testing methods including polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using respiratory samples or saliva, quantitative antigen tests using respiratory samples or saliva, and point-of-care antigen tests using respiratory samples (9) . Information about these cases (e.g., demographics, date of onset, contact with previously confirmed cases, places where contact with previously confirmed cases occurred) is posted on the local government website every day. The age of each patient is published in 10-year incremental age groups. We retrieved this information and constructed a database as previously described (Supplementary Table 1 ) (10, 11) . In the study, the age of students in primary schools, junior high schools, and high schools was defined as 7-12 years old, 13-15 years old, and 16-18 years old, respectively. The incidence of pediatric and adolescent cases was calculated for those aged between 0 and 9 years and 10 and 19 years using the population data published by Statistics Bureau of Japan (12). Five or more COVID-19 cases with known contact with previously confirmed cases in the same events or venues were defined as a cluster, based on information about places of contacts and dates of onset/confirmation, which were collected during case investigations by local public health authorities and summarized in our database. The secondary transmission rate was calculated for pediatric and adolescent cases who had no known contact with previously confirmed cases. This is because individuals who had known contact with confirmed cases before confirmation were requested to be self-quarantined before confirmation (9) . Definition of a pair of primary and secondary cases was described in Supplementary Figure 1 .",

The numbers of pediatric and adolescent cases reached their peaks in mid-April and resurged from late-June, which was parallel to the increasing patterns of the total cases of all age groups (Figure 1 ). The median (interquartile range) of the duration between onset and confirmation was 4 days (3-7) among pediatric and adolescent cases, which was significantly shorter than that among the total cases of all age groups [6 days (3-9) , p < 0.001]. Among 7,758 cases, 4,734 (61%) cases had contact with previously confirmed cases ( Table 1) . They were presumed to have acquired infection in various settings, however, the household was the most common setting (1,521/4,734, 32%) ( Table 1) .",

In contrast to the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, in which children and adolescents were the most affected age groups, their risks of acquiring infection were assumed to be limited for COVID-19 (14) . The significantly shorter duration between onset and confirmation than older age groups was potentially because most of the infected children and adolescents were identified as close contacts of previously confirmed cases. This also might be contributing to high proportions of asymptomatic cases among children and adolescents with COVID-19. Furthermore, the most common setting where pediatric and adolescent cases generated secondary transmission was their households. Our results suggest their limited capacities to spread COVID-19 in settings outside households. This finding was in consistence with previous reports of pediatric and adolescent COVID-19 cases in Ireland and Singapore which described their minimal capacity to transmit the virus at schools (15, 16) .",

The concept of a pair of primary and secondary cases in the study is illustrated. Cases before being classified as either of primary or secondary cases were indicated in white symbols (A). Cases who were classified as primary cases were indicated in gray symbols, and those classified as secondary cases were in black symbols (B). Each secondary case was regarded to have only one primary case, and a primary case was regarded to have earlier date of onset than secondary cases. Information about places of contacts and dates of onset was collected during case investigations in local governments and were summarized in our database. If cases were asymptomatic or their date of onset was unknown, date of confirmation was used to identify primary and secondary cases. If more than one suspected primary case had same date of onset, we regarded the case with the earliest date of confirmation or the smallest identification numbers assigned by local governments as the primary case. Date of onset of secondary cases were regarded to be within 7 days after the date of onset of primary cases. The white symbol 1, without known contact with previously confirmed cases, had earlier date of onset or confirmation than white symbols 2-4 (A). Therefore, the white symbol 1 was classified as the primary case (gray symbol 1), and the white symbols 2-4 were classified as his/her secondary cases (black symbols 2-4) (B).Supplementary Table 1 | Variables included in COVID-19 database. Variables included in our coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) database was listed with descriptions. We retrieved information of COVID-19 cases from local governments' websites which were publishing information of cases collected in their routine case investigations. All local governments in Japan were updating their websites with information of newly identified COVID-19 cases every day.",
