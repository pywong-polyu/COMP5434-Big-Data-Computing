Their mean age was 11.6 years (\u00b1 4.1 years), and most of them 31.2% (54/173) had a rheumatoid factor-negative polyarticular JIA. Fifty percent (86/172) were treated with methotrexate, and 72.5% (124/171) were treated with bDMARDs. DMARD treatment modification in relation to the pandemic was observed in 4.0% (7/173) of participants. 49.1% (81/165) of the patients did not return to school due to a personal/parental decision in 69.9% (55/81) of cases. Two patients were diagnosed positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Conclusion: This study suggests that JIA patients treated with DMARDs continued their treatment during the pandemic and were rarely affected by symptomatic COVID-19. In contrast, parents' reluctance was a major obstacle for returning to school. Therefore, more solidified school reopening strategies should be developed.",

Most SARS-CoV-2 infections lead to moderate influenza-like symptoms, loss of taste or isolated mild fever but can also lead to severe hypoxemic syndrome and death. Data concerning children with COVID-19 seem reassuring, and very few of them develop severe forms of the disease (2, (5) (6) (7) (8) . In France, the first patients were identified on the 24th of January. Two areas of intense viral circulation, also called hot spots, appeared in February 2020: the first area in the eastern part of France and the second area in Paris. The first lockdown period occurred from 17 March to 11 May, which included the closure of schools and universities. After 11 May, a progressive return to school was then proposed, with many difficulties and fears, first in primary school and then in secondary school. Compulsory return to school was scheduled for June 22nd. The reopening plan to prevent contamination was based in France on physical distancing, face coverings after the age of 6 years, hygiene, staggering of schedules, and smaller fixed groups of students. This happened in a context of general anxiety.",

            "text": "Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) is a rare disease with different subtypes (9, 10) . Patients are treated, in most cases, with immunosuppressant agents but also with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and corticosteroids. Most JIA patients and their parents are educated regarding the treatmentrelated risk of infection (11) . Therefore, an epidemic with the new coronavirus is of major concern. Families affected by JIA have been particularly impacted by this situation because of conflicting data regarding viral transmission in school by children that were initially considered superspreaders (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) . At the onset of the sanitary crisis, the vulnerability of patients treated with diseasemodifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs), nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) or corticosteroids had been suggested on the basis of experience gained in other situations of viral infections and data from the first cohort studies of SARS-CoV-2-infected patients (17, 18) . Despite rapid clarification from health authorities and learned French rheumatologic and pediatric societies regarding the indication to continue ongoing immunosuppressive therapy in most clinical situations, some of these scientific data and their relay through the media may have impacted the ongoing immunosuppressive treatment of JIA patients (19) . In May, the French pediatric society also made recommendations about the urgent need for a return to school, highlighting the desocialization and isolation of some children and the risk of domestic violence in some cases (20) . Accordingly, our objectives were (1) to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the therapeutic management of JIA, (2) the frequency of returning to school after the first lockdown period, (3) and finally the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection at the time of the survey.",

This large survey was based on questionnaires but provides a global picture of patients' and parents' attitudes. Our results highlight the fact that, in the end, a majority of patients declared to have unchanged their treatments on the one hand and to be afraid to return to school on the other hand. These data were not correlated to hot spot zones but were a global attitude in France. In our study, we unexpectedly showed that patients did not modify their immunosuppressive treatment in a large majority of cases. For those who changed their treatment, independent of a medical decision, the reason was clearly fear of the patients due to the global context. In our cohort, only 14 patients reduced or stopped their treatment at the time of our study, and among them, only nine patients declared that their modifications of treatment were related to the health sanitary crisis (six patients with DMARD, two patients with NSAIDs and one patient for both) and not to a medical recommendation. Therefore, our results reflect good adherence of the patient/parents to their immunosuppressive treatments. This seems to be consistent with other studies, showing good adherence to biological treatments (21) (22) (23) (24) and in this unprecedented context, in comparison to patients with other chronic non-respiratory pathologies treated with immunosuppressors, JIA patients seems to be compliant with their treatment. In fact, children with inflammatory bowel disease did not discontinue their immunomodulatory treatments (25) , patients with rheumatoid arthritis declared a modification in their treatment in 11% of cases (26) , and patients with systemic lupus modified their treatment in 10% of cases (27) . Of course, these data must take into account the selfreport aspect of our study and the difficulty of measuring therapy adherence. In chronic pediatric diseases, therapeutic adherence depends not only on the patient's behavior but also on their parents, whose role is essential. Adherence (also named compliance or observance) to treatment is a complex notion that is difficult to measure (21) (22) (23) . Direct assessment criteria, such as biological drug assays, are invasive and not easy to perform in routine practice. Therefore, indirect measurements have been developed, frequently based on selfadministered questionnaires. For example, the Child Adherence Report Questionnaire (CARQ) (22) , the Parent Adherence Report Questionnaire (PARQ) (28) , or the Morisky questionnaire have been used to evaluate children's therapy adherence (29) . However, this study describes the therapeutic modifications that can be highlighted during a classic interview with patients but does not take into account the more complex problem of noncompliance.",

The small number of patients diagnosed positive for SARS-CoV-2 could be explained by the low number of tests performed on children at beginning of the pandemic, but also because population avoided going to hospital because of fear. As expected, the frequency of comorbidities was rare, and few children benefited from long-term treatment with corticosteroids or NSAIDs.",

In France, school reopening plans were not based on large testing programs or exhaustive screening for COVID-19 symptoms but on physical distancing measures, masks, hygiene and cohorting students in smaller groups. Although it may have been important for the parents that their children return to school, 57.6% of the patients were anxious, and 49% of the JIA patients did not return to school due to anxiety of the parents regarding COVID-19. In comparison with national French data from 24 June 2020, 80% of schoolchildren (primary and secondary), have returned to school (33) . Not return to school was related to parents' decisions in 39/81 (48.1%) of cases but also to administrative decisions in 18/81 (22.2%) of cases and sometimes based on difficulties for parents in organizing themselves regarding their own jobs. This clearly revealed that the balance between risk and benefit for return to school was negative for the parents and this is corroborated by a recent study, showing better adherence to isolation measures in patients with rheumatic diseases (34) .",

In some cases, patients could have hesitated to mention their own attitude regarding their treatment and may partly explain why we have such a low rate of reported treatment modification. Moreover, this questionnaire is not a validated questionnaire for measuring treatment compliance. All subtypes of JIA were not equally represented: we had a low number of patients with severe disease, such as systemic JIA, where most patients would have severe comorbidities related to COVID-19, such as high doses of corticosteroids. As we included only patients with immunosuppressive treatment, we cannot extrapolate to JIA treated only with NSAIDs. Moreover, oligoarticular JIA is usually the most frequent type of JIA but not in our study, which was probably due to the need to be receiving DMARD treatment to be included, while various types of oligoarticular JIA are treated with NSAIDs only. Perhaps a larger sample that included these patients could have shown different results regarding adherence to treatment. In our population, few patients tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, probably due to a low number of tests carried out on the children in the first wave. On 9 September 2020, the French Society of Pediatrics proposed some new recommendations, particularly more regular screening of patients over 6 years of age (35) .",
