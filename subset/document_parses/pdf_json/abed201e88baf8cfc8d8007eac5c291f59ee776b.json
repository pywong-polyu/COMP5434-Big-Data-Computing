This review describes the process of lung cancer-specific MTBs and the transition process from face-to-face tumor boards to virtual ones. The review also focuses on the project organization's description, advantages, and disadvantages. Semi-structured interviews identified five major themes for MTBs: current practice, attitudes, enablers, barriers, and benefits for the MTB. MTB teams exhibited positive responses to modeled data feedback. Virtualization reduces time spent for travel, allowing easier and timely patient discussions. This process requires a secure web platform to assure the respect of patients' privacy and presents the same unanswered prob-",

Studies aimed to improve preparations, structure, and conduct of MTBs, research methods to monitor their performance, teamwork, and outcomes are also outlined in this article. Analysis of literature shows that MTB participants discuss 5-8 cases per meeting and that the use of a vMTB for lung cancer and in particular stage III NSCLC and complex stage IV cases is widely accepted by most health professionals. Despite still-existing gaps, overall vMTB represents a unique opportunity to optimize patient management in a patientcentered approach.

A MTB includes a set of diverse specialists cooperating in the same setting, such as thoracic surgeons, medical oncologists, radiation oncologists, radiologists, pneumologists, pathologists, and molecular biologists, often defined as ''core team'' [4] . The extended board may also encompass nuclear medicine specialists, nutritionists, palliative and rehabilitation care physicians, patients' advocacy representatives, research nurses, or other specialists, and in academic centers also students and postdoctoral fellows [6] . Very recently, a cross-sectional qualitative interview study on breast and gynecological cancer MTB explored patients' participation in tumor conferences at six cancer centers in Germany with conflicting results [7] . Besides the fact that half of the health providers had no experience in such settings, the study concluded that routine patients' participation in MTD was not feasible due to providers' barriers and negative experiences. Only selected patients might be included in MTD looking for new opportunities and with positive experiences.",

Health governance studies on LC management suggest that integrated and multidisciplinary care reduces barriers to treatment and variation in care, improves adherence to clinical guidelines, staging, and care coordination. This strategy also significantly shortens the interval from diagnosis to treatment, and ultimately leads to a better patient experience and an increase in the quality of care for LC patients [8, 9] .

            "text": "Some evidence suggests that implementing MDT discussions improves patients' outcomes, i.e., pretreatment evaluation, proper staging, adequate treatment, quality of survivorship, and overall survival [12] [13] [14] . Specchia et al. very recently reported an umbrella review on MTB's impact on all types of cancer, reporting only one systematic review on LC published several years ago in 2008 [13, 14] . However, Australian researchers recently published a scoping review of current evidence for LC-MDT data collection and analysis and its impact on clinical outcome [16] [17] [18] . The authors identified 13 studies that presented lung cancer MDT-related clinical outcomes. Three studies included MDTs from multiple tumor streams, while ten specifically focused on LC-MDTs. Overall, 11 investigations, eight of which positive, examined the effect of MDT discussion on patients' clinical outcomes. Three studies included data from MDT records and the other three from medical patients' records. Five studies used institutional registries, while the remaining six extracted data from state or national administrative datasets, with some overlap. Despite that MDT data collection is not well defined, the importance of clinical audits and data feedback and the potential for real-time analysis to improve outcomes deserve further investigation. In 2001, a single-institution study in the USA reported changes in the pretreatment evaluation, diagnosis, and treatment plans in 20-50% of cases, mainly breast cancer, presented at MTBs [19] . In 2007, the French Groupe d' Oncologie Thoracique Azur\u00e9en carried out a 1-year prospective study on 334 patients discussed during its multidisciplinary weekly meetings showing a 4.4% therapeutic discordance between the planned and the administered treatment [20] . In this series of patients, median delay of treatment was 20 days, and the overall 1-year survival rate was lower for patients with MTD discordance with no statistical significance. A study carried out in Australia on 988 LC patients registered in the cancer registry before 2011 showed how MTD discussion produced a significantly better receipt of radiotherapy among non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with any stage (66 vs. 33%, p \\ 0.001) and had significantly better receipt of chemotherapy among patients with stage IV NSCLC (46 vs. 29%, p \\ 0.001) and palliative care (66 vs. 53%, p \\ 0.001) as compared to patients without MDT discussion [21] . A logistic regression analysis identified MDT discussion as an independent predictor of receiving radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and referral to palliative care but did not influence survival. In 2012, a retrospective and comparative scientific report showed that in the UK, the introduction of multidisciplinary care was associated with improved overall survival and reduced variation in survival data in various hospitals with MTB compared to the hospitals without such implementation [22] . In 2015, investigators at the MD Anderson Cancer Center and the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute published a survey on 1198 physicians to explore LC-MTB participation associations with patient survival and rate of clinical trial enrollment guideline-recommended care, and patient-reported quality [23] . This paper showed that physician engagement in MTB was associated with higher patient clinical trial participation and higher curative-intent surgery rates for stage I-II NSCLC but not with overall survival. In the same year, a national cohort study in Taiwan showed that the adjusted hazard ratio of death of stage III and IV NSCLC patients discussed at MDT was significantly lower at multivariate Cox proportional hazards model than that of patients without MDT discussion (HR = 0.87, 95% confidence interval = 0.84-0.90) [24] . Data were also analyzed for the propensity score as a control variable to reduce selection bias between patients with and without MDT care involvement. In 2018, an Australian cohort study included 1197 cases discussed prospectively at MTB and analyzed for adjusted survival and referral to palliative care [25] . Survival of patients discussed at MTD was higher for all stages but IIIB as compared to patients not discussed, but referral to palliative care was not different. Overall adjusted survival analysis for the entire cohort showed improved survival at 5 years for patients discussed at MDT (HR 0.7, range, 0.58-0.85, p \\ 0.001). However, the MTD group had a lower stage IV percentage (39.3 vs. 56.1%) and a higher proportion of early stage disease (stage I, 23.1 vs. 9.7%, and stage II, 10.2 vs. 4.8%, stage IIIA, 14.6 vs. 6.3%). In 2018, a retrospective propensity score analysis was performed on 246 consecutive Italian patients who underwent surgery for NSCLC before or after implementing an MTB [26] . Patients discussed at the MTB showed more complete staging, better TMN classification, and a longer 1-year survival rate when compared to those who were not discussed at the MTB. In 2020, a German matched-pair analysis showed a positive impact of a higher number of multidisciplinary tumor boards on the clinical outcome [27] . Patients discussed at C 3 MTD meetings had a significantly better overall survival than patients never discussed. In the same year, researchers in Taiwan carried out a retrospective study on 500 patients with stage III NSCLC to evaluate MTB's impact on survival. The median survival of patients discussed at MDT was statically longer than that of control patients (41.2 vs. 25.7 months; p = 0.018) [28] .",

Even if concurrent chemoradiotherapy plus subsequent immunotherapy are currently considered the standard of care of stage III NSCLC, however in real life, the approach is still heterogeneous across different specialists. An Italian cooperative group launched a 15-question web-based survey focusing on diagnostic/ therapeutic of stage III to 421 health professionals, including pneumologists, thoracic surgeons, and radiation and medical oncologists [29] . Some discrepancies were present in clinical locally advanced NSCLC management: the lack of a regularly planned multidisciplinary tumor board, the use of upfront surgery in multi-station stage IIIA, and territorial diffusion of chemo-radiotherapy in unresectable locally advanced NSCLC. This analysis demonstrated good compliance with international guidelines in the diagnostic workup of locally advanced NSCLC and a relationship between high clinical experience and good clinical practice. In NSCLC, precise diagnosis and adequate staging are essential to ensure uniform allocation to the best treatment strategy, but these parameters may differ among MDTs. In 2020, Dutch investigators showed a high grade of variability in T and N staging and treatment recommendation in a series of 110 patients with stage IIIA NSCLC among MDTs in different hospitals [30] . Agreement on clinical staging and treatment recommendations was rated using Randolph's free-marginal multi-rater kappa as a chance-adjusted index. Staging of T (T3 vs. T4) and N (N1 vs. N2) showed the highest variability, which reflected a wide range of additional diagnostics and influenced treatment recommendations as induction therapy and type.",

A recent publication extensively reviewed this complex issue as regard to quality metrics [36] . To date, few studies have explored this issue so far using a standardized approach. The quality of decisionmaking in MTD depends on the quality of records presented and team processes quality. Medical literature reports that MTD usually discusses 5-8 cases per meeting [35] . German investigators employed an adaptation of the observer rating scale Multidisciplinary Tumor Board Metric for the Observation of Decision-Making (MDT-MODe) to assess the quality of the presented information and team processes in 249 cases discussed at 29 MTBs [37] . Although the quality of different aspects of information differs significantly, this study reported high mean completeness of tumor records. However, quality psychosocial details and information on patient opinion were considered low and necessitating improvement. At mixed logistic regression analysis, uncertainty and discrepancies on medical treatment discussions were linked to a higher rate for more than one treatment recommendation. Time limitation per case also represented a negative factor. A Korean study, published in 2020, retrospectively evaluated the level of agreement between IBM Watson for Oncology cognitive computing system and 405 LC-MDT recommendations concerning surgery, radiotherapy, chemo-radiotherapy, and palliative care [38] . Concordance between MDT and IBM Watson for Oncology occurred in 92.4% of all cases (p \\ 0.001), and concordance differed according to clinical stages. The agreement's strength was excellent (100%) in stage IV NSCLC and extensive disease small-cell lung carcinoma (SCLC). In stage I NSCLC, the agreement rate was high (92.4%). The concordance between MTD and artificial intelligence system was moderate in stage III NSCLC (80.8%) and relatively lower in stage II NSCLC (83.3%) and limited disease small-cell lung cancer (84.6%). The discrepancy was 12.3% in surgical decisions, 16.7% of radiotherapy prescriptions, and 11.6% chemo-radiotherapy choices. No discordance occurred in metastatic disease patients. However, investigators concluded that IBM Watson for Oncology was just an assisting tool in stage I-III NSCLC and limited disease SCLC. In this stage of the disease, the patient-doctor relationship and shared decision-making may be more critical.",

Computed clinical decision support systems (CDSSs) are significant technological progress and an integral component of today's health information technologies [39] . They assist health professionals with interpretation, diagnosis, staging, and treatment. A CDSS can be embedded throughout the patient safety continuum providing reminders, recommendations, and alerts to health care providers. Although CDSSs may reduce medical errors and improve patient outcomes, they have fallen short of their full potential. User acceptance has been identified as one of the potential reasons for this shortfall. Investigators at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, USA, reported a critical analysis of health professional barriers to the adoption of computed clinical decision support systems [40] . Health professional non-acceptation of CDSS was the main barrier to technology implementation, with a possible negative effect on patients' health and well-being. The incorporation of CDSSs based on user needs/expectations in the assistance-engage model may improve the tool's use. Using CCDSs in lung cancer, MTBs may increase the efficiency of workflows supporting participants in elaborating a shared conceptual workflow of a patient case. CCDSs may help the MTB to evaluate the completeness of collected diagnostic data, stratification for the right personalized therapy according to the clinical and radiological stage and other treatment-influencing factors, and adapt care management strategies when needed. CDSSs have not been currently included in the MTB decision-making workflow, which hampers their clinical practice impact. A group of Dutch and UK researchers designed a CDSS for multidisciplinary decisionmaking in LC to support the goals mentioned earlier by presenting relevant clinical data in line with the MDT members' existing mental model structures [41] . Results achieved in simulated LC-MTBs showed that CDSSs help participants in their capacity to adjust diagnosis, staging, and classification according to the TNM system. It enabled cross-validation of diagnostic findings, surfaced discordance between diagnostic tests, and facilitated LC staging according to the diagnostic evidence, and spotting contraindications for personalized treatment selection.",

            "text": "A clinical observation study on the efficacy and efficiency of vMTB started in July 2020 [43] . Figure 3 shows the flowchart of the vMTB process. Subspecialty cancer-specific vMTB are held at 6:30 pm once a week or twice a month, according to the availability of clinical cases and the participants' needs. The vMTB attendees include medical oncologists, radiation oncologists, surgeons, pathologists, molecular biologists, radiologists, nuclear medicine specialists, patients' advocacy members, and a case manager. These health professionals represent the ''core team'', other specialists can also participate depending on the tumor board's type and specialty. Some vMTBs may also include nutritionists, palliative care physicians, and research nurses. A useful tumor board also requires a leader to chair and run the meetings. The leader should facilitate the decision-making process by allowing the team discussion and information sharing. A coordinator will also be useful in planning the web conferences and coordinate all the members of the vMTB. Meetings occur on a web conferencing platform, provided with a specific license, with secure patient data protection and storage. Within teleconference meetings, participants employ a fully integrated platform of scalable, secure workflow solutions and apps designed to support care teams with analytics and actionable insights. This platform allows geo-localization of clinical trials, matching recommendations with updated guidelines, and access to relevant updated medical literature. The attendees invited by the guest can only attend the conference; the members can access the web platform via the URL link provided to access the meeting. Patient records are anonymized and presented by the primary oncology provider through the platform's presentation (Fig. 3) . Patients have been previously informed by their doctors and have signed informed consent forms. The MTB workflow encompasses sending cases by the presenting physician to the administrator who collates and lists all the points on a platform's passwordprotected room. The clinical cases are initially presented by the patient's primary physician with relevant radiologic and pathologic findings and then discussed to obtain a final recommendation proposal. At the end of each case discussion, our web platform allows electronic and anonymous voting of the clinical decisions proposed during the meeting. If a consensus C 75% of participants is achieved, each patient's chart is filled with the board's final recommendations employing the platform drop-down menu. Patients' data and decisions are then stored and may be rediscussed as follow-up progresses. The shared recommendations can be scanned and uploaded into the electronic health record system. In our experience, lung tumor board meetings usually regard the multimodality approach to stage III lung cancer, an advanced-stage disease with molecular drivers, and clinical trial opportunities. Virtual MTB organizers constituted a steering committee to validate decisions and promote scientific research (Fig. 3) . After 6 months, a survey on the acceptability, appropriateness, and feasibility of vMTB was e-distributed to 74 health professionals who have been attending the meetings. We found that the majority (95%) of respondents reported that the transition to a virtual MTD was feasible and acceptable, providing the same standard of care as face-to-face MDTs. The survey positively highlighted the impact of the project as follows: 91% on optimization of clinical information flows; 96% on equity of care; 88% on collaboration among specialists and method standardization; 77% on data security, tracking, storage, and reuse. Currently, the scientific opinions expressed have been verified as adhering to the guidelines and scientific evidence available in all the cases examined.",

An Australian study explored the possibility to develop and implement a standardized template for lung cancer MTB to provide clear clinical information and treatment recommendations to all participants and general practitioners [44] . This approach could also ensure timely information sharing between tertiary and primary care centers. The study involved 41 physicians and researchers developing a template and implementation strategy and employed a mixed-method study design using structured interviews with 61 participating general practitioners. The MDT-reporting template appears to be a feasible way of providing clinical information to general practitioners following patient presentation at a lung cancer MDT meeting. Ninety-five percent of general practitioners strongly agreed that the standardized template offered useful and relevant information, was received on time (90%), and that the information was easy to interpret and communicate to the patient (84%). Implementation process data show that the pre-implementation stage's investment to integrate the template into standard work practices was critical in the successful implementation.",

The most challenging clinical cases should be discussed first, when all the attendees are available, and each case should be presented within a given time. The data recording should be goal-oriented: all the participants should have access to patients' information and may be able to edit them.

Although telemedicine has facilitated patient management, more studies are needed to validate this new clinical practice. MDT data collection and linkage are not standardized and not routine with few exceptions, although data collection and feedback are recommended explicitly by at least one statutory body. In conclusion, vMTB permits optimal per-patient decision-making as treatment options become ever-more specialized in the era of biomarkerdriven therapeutic strategies.",
