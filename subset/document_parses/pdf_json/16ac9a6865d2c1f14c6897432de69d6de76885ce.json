            "text": "To evaluate the clinical application effect of spiral computed tomography (CT) three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction based on artificial intelligence in transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI), a CT 3D reconstruction model based on deep convolutional neural networks (DCNN) was established in this research, which was compared with the model-based iterative reconstruction (MBIR) and used in clinical practice. Then, 62 patients with aortic stenosis (AS) who underwent TAVI surgery were recruited as the research objects. The accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of the multislice spiral CT scan (MSCT) and transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) in predicting the type of TAVI surgical valve were compared and analyzed. The results showed that the mean absolute error (MAE) (0.01) and root mean square error (RMSE) (0.086) of the MBIR model were higher than the reconstruction model in this research. The structural similarity (SSIM) (0.831) and peak signal-to noise ratio (PSNR) (32.77 dB) of the MBIR model were lower than the reconstruction model, and the differences were considerable (P < 0:05). Of the valve models selected based on the TTE measurement results, 35 cases were accurately predicted and 27 cases were incorrectly predicted. The accuracy of MSCT was 87.1%, the specificity was 98.84%, and the sensitivity was 92.87%; all of which were significantly higher than TTE (P < 0:05). In summary, compared with the MBIR reconstruction model, the imaging results of the model established in this research were closer to the real image. Compared with TTE, MSCT had higher accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity and can provide more accurate preoperative predictions for patients undergoing TAVI surgery.",

Some studies have shown that the incidence rate in people over 75 years old is about 5% [1, 2] . The clinical manifestations of AS are chest tightness, dyspnea, and even myocardial infarction and sudden death in patients with inflammation [3] . AS can lead to increased pressure load of the left ventricle, resulting in a shortened diastolic period and prolonged ejection time [4] . The pathogenic causes of AS include inflammation, degenerative changes, and congenital developmental malformations. The most common lesions of AS abroad are degenerative calcification in old age, while the most common cause of AS in China is rheumatic heart disease [5] [6] [7] .",

However, since most patients with AS are elderly people over 70 years old, they are often accompanied by diseases such as renal failure and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, which greatly increase the risk of surgery [11, 12] . Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is one of the hot topics in cardiovascular research in recent years. Compared with SAVR, this technique has less trauma, lower risk, and fewer contraindications and is suitable for AS patients who cannot be treated with SAVR [13, 14] . The operation path of TAVI mainly includes the anterograde method and the method of operation. Both of these surgical methods belong to the complicated interventional treatments, which have strict requirements for imaging examinations, requiring high accuracy and clear imaging [15] . At present, the clinical imaging methods used to assess AS mainly include transthoracic echocardiography (TTE), nuclear magnetic resonance (MRI), and multislice spiral CT scan (MSCT) [16, 17] . Echocardiography is a noninvasive examination, and there is no radiation damage. The operation is simple, but the imaging quality is not good, and it is greatly affected by the operation level of the clinician [18] . Cardiac MRI is not affected by the gas in the bones and lungs, and clearly shows the internal conditions of the heart. The imaging results have better spatial and temporal resolution and are less affected by the level of the operator. However, the technology has many contraindications, and the cooperation of the examinee is required [19] . MSCT combines the advantages of ultrasound and MRI technology, can clearly show the structure and spatial relationship of normal tissue and lesion tissue, and is widely used in assessing the degree of calcification and valve stenosis in AS patients [20, 21] .",

Some scholars used intelligent algorithms to train image segmentation models in a large number of datasets, which speeds up imaging and improves imaging quality [24] . Among them, deep learning is the most widely used. Kong et al. [25] used the volume neural network to achieve the segmentation of CT images, and the effect was good.

According to the measured results, a suitable valve type was selected (the predicted value) and the predicted value was compared with the actual value of the operation. Le\u00f3n Del Pino et al. [31] explored the risk factors of prosthesis-patient mismatch (PPM) in 185 patients after TAVI surgery. The results showed that the higher European cardiovascular risk factor score (Euro Score), smaller prosthesis size, and smaller aortic ring diameter were associated with PPM. After TAVI, 4 of 62 patients had valve type 23, while 43 patients were treated with valve type 26. Valve type 29 was used in 13 patients, and valve type 23 was used in 2 patients. The valve type used in TAVI surgery was selected according to the diameter, area, and circumference of the aortic valve ring, and an appropriate valve type was the key to successful surgery [32] . In this research, 54 cases of valve models selected based on MSCT measurement results were correctly predicted, while 8 cases were incorrectly predicted. Among the valve models selected according to TTE measurement results, 35 cases were correctly predicted and 27 cases were incorrectly predicted.

Preoperative evaluation of TTE can measure the internal anatomical structure and valve size of the heart in real time, but it is easily affected by the operator level and aortic valve calcification, so the measurement results of TTE are small. Doris et al. [33] evaluated the severity of aortic stenosis in patients with aortic valve calcification by CT quantification (CT-AVC) and conducted a comparative study with echocardiography. The results showed that CT-AVC was reproducible and the measurement reproducibility became more standardized over time, with higher accuracy than echocardiography, which was similar to the results of this research.",
