The current challenges to reduce the health risks from the pandemic COVID-19 suggests the answer is ''no.'' Many US citizens and policymakers at the national and local levels chose to downplay or ignore the COVID-19 pandemic for weeks before the stock market crash and the number of deaths began to increase at an increasing rate (Monbiot 2020; Russonello 2020) . Why? To better understand this behavior, we step back and explore pandemic risk trade-offs using the case of pre-and post-Ebola in the mid-2010s. Using a natural experiment, we surveyed the US citizens about their risk-risk trade-offs before and immediately after the highly visible 2014 Ebola scare (Viscusi et al. 1991; Viscusi 2009 ). Using a unique survey administered both before and after the 2014 West African Ebola Outbreak, we ask the US citizens to value fatalities from pandemic risks compared to deaths from environmental disaster risks (e.g., Bhopal, Exxon, Deepwater, Fukushima) and or a terrorist attack (e.g., 9/11).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 417, "end": 431, "text": "(Monbiot 2020;", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 432, "end": 448, "text": "Russonello 2020)", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 751, "end": 772, "text": "(Viscusi et al. 1991;", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 773, "end": 785, "text": "Viscusi 2009", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "Working with Wyoming Survey and Analysis Center (WYSAC), we administered a computer-based questionnaire.

WYSAC secured 321 surveys (pre-Ebola Outbreak); tered, securing 357 surveys. Our results show that prior to the Ebola scare, people were relatively complacent and placed a low relative priority on public spending to prepare for a pandemic disease outbreak. Surprisingly, we also find that the Ebola scare did not increase the demand for preparedness among the surveyed US citizens. This flat behavioral reaction to risk was unexpected given long-standing evidence on the pervasiveness of the availability heuristic (Tversky and Kahneman 1981) .

The increased media coverage of Ebola at the time highlighted the ''oversights in personal protective equipment use, disinfection, the collection, transport, and disposal of hazardous waste, the provision of social services for those placed under quarantine, and post-event monitoring and travel restrictions for potentially exposed health workers'' (Kirchhoff 2016) .

Viscusi et al. (1991) developed a method to measure the value of morbidity risk reductions which has two advantages to address catastrophic events. First, catastrophic risks tend to involve small absolute probabilities, which respondents find difficult to process. This method lets them focus on more readily processed comparisons such as whether preventing 100 deaths from a terrorist attack is valued more highly than preventing 100 traffic deaths. Second, ''the comparisons involve a single dimension of choice-fatalities-so that respondents can focus on how fatalities are viewed without dealing with the less readily commensurable tradeoff between money and fatality risks. Eliminating money as an attribute of choice also eliminates the task of establishing a credible payment mechanism for the policy'' (Viscusi 2009) . Table 1 summarizes our main results for both pre-and post-Ebola outbreak surveys. In 2013, we surveyed a nationally representative US web-based panel, and found respondents valued the prevention of terrorist attack deaths and environmental disasters significantly more than pandemic outbreak deaths. Like spread betting in gambling, the person gets ''points'' when trading off terrorism risk for pandemic risk. If she is going to give up 1 terrorism life saved, she has to get nearly 1.5 pandemic lives saved in return. Similarly, for an environmental disaster-for giving up 1 environmental life saved, she needs 2 pandemic lives in return.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 265, "end": 286, "text": "Viscusi et al.

Respondents in states on the Mexico border and those of Asian descent favored policies that reduce the risk of environmental disasters rather than pandemics. Respondents located on the west coast and are physically removed from the 9/11 attack and the Boston Marathon bombing favored policies that reduce pandemic risk over policies that reduce terrorism risk, while respondents with income greater than $150,000 and living on the East Coast preferred policies that reduce terrorist attack risk over pandemic risk. Proximity to a catastrophic event affects value of policies to prevent that event from occurring.

People do not value the expected deaths differently, rather they have different expectations of the likelihood of death from these different causes. Our estimates suggest that people find it more difficult to quantify the risks associated with events such as pandemic outbreaks for which they have less experience. This is in contrast to the tangible risks of terrorist attacks such as 9/11 and environmental disasters such as the 2008 Kingston Fossil Plant coal fly ash slurry spill, the 2010 Deepwater British Petroleum Inc.

We appreciate that the focus of the terrorism and environmental disaster risks refer to only the US events, while the pandemic risks include the USA and several other countries, which implies that people might have focused on the US-only risks given they preferred investing in the US only. While acknowledging this point could be a possibility, we think it is less likely that respondents kept their preferences flat because they were thinking of foreign lives. Our survey communicated that there were both US risks and foreign risks to the respondents.

In early 2015, we re-administered our survey to a new representative US web-based panel adding the definition of Ebola and the phrase ''such as Ebola'' or ''like Ebola'' three times throughout the survey. Based on Bayesian learning models in which people update probabilities based on information they acquire, and the availability heuristic (Tversky and Kahneman 1981), we would expect higher valuations for avoiding pandemic risks.

Respondents with income greater than $150,000 and living on the east coast were now indifferent between policies, but those respondents affiliated with the Republican Party and male respondents now prefer policies that reduce terrorist attack risk over pandemic risk.
