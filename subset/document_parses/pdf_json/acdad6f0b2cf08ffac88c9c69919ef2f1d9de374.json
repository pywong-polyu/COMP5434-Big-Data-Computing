Though the mechanism of the virus-host interaction and the possible treatment have been the subject of several hundred studies, effective and safe treatment regime or a vaccine is yet to emerge. Drug repurposing may be a possible solution for immediate treatment, and scores of drugs have been suggested from various perspectives [1, 2] The drugs that could be used for the treatment of Covid-19 can be classified into three categories: Antivirals, anti-inflammatory and supporting therapies. Antiviral action can further be broadly classified into three categories [3] . The first category of anti-virals is the fusion inhibitors, or virus-entry preventers. These essentially prevent the fusion of the virus and the penetration into the human cell cytoplasm [3] . Enzymes such as the Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme (ACE-2) and the Transmembrane serine protease (TMPRSS2), play important roles in endocytosis. One of the key factors in virus entry is the protease activation of S glycoprotein.",

During replication and particle assembly, viral proteases cleave polyproteins expressed by the virus to produce a number of essential Non-Structural Proteins (NSPs). Hence, protease-inhibitors are a popular class of antiviral candidates [3] . The end result of viral transcription is the production of a negative sense RNA that is used for replication. The formation of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), a crucial enzyme in the replication process, is another target for drug discovery. Two sets of drugs have been tried to blunt this step. Ritonavir-Lopinavir combination, for example, works to block the formation of NSPs. They are protease inhibitors. Another set of drugs, such as Remdesivir and Favipiravir, interferes with the RdRp thus, inhibiting virus replication.",

The other factor, as stated earlier, is the inhibition of Cathepsin L activity for fusion. Ragav et al.

The Hosmer and Lemeshow goodness of fit test returned a p-value of 0.729, thus ascertaining a good fit. Fischer scoring algorithm converged in 4 iterations and the deviance check also confirmed a good fit. Propensity Scores were calculated and the matching carried out using 'MatchIt' command of R. A greedy algorithm with 'nearest' as the option for search and a caliper of 0.12 was arrived at by trial and error.
