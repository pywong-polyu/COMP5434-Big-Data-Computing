To meet this need, we are leveraging our existing vaccine platform to target SARS-CoV-2. Here, we generated cellular heat shock chaperone protein, glycoprotein 96 (gp96), to deliver SARS-CoV-2 protein S (spike) to the immune system and to induce cell-mediated immune responses. We showed that our vaccine platform effectively stimulates a robust cellular immune response against protein S. Moreover, we confirmed that gp96-Ig, secreted from allogeneic cells expressing fulllength protein S, generates powerful, protein S polyepitope-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses in both lung interstitium and airways. These findings were further strengthened by the observation that protein-S -specific CD8+ T cells were induced in human leukocyte antigen HLA-A2.1 transgenic mice thus providing encouraging translational data that the vaccine is likely to work in humans, in the context of SARS-CoV-2 antigen presentation.",

We generated a gp96-Ig-secreting vaccine expressing full-length spike or \"S\" glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 via a cell-delivered platform. Targeting SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein remains the favorable vaccine choice as it is one of the most abundant and immunogenic proteins translated from the SARS-CoV-2 genome (1). Antibodies targeting S protein aim to neutralize mammalian host-cell interaction, thereby minimizing viral multiplicity of infection, however, recent studies have shown that \"antibodies are not enough\" to protect against COVID-19 for a variety of reasons, including S-protein glycosylation, which shields the antibody from eliciting an optimal neutralization response (2) . Antibody decay has also been detected in individuals after recovery from COVID-19, and this decline was more rapid than reported for the first SARS infection in 2003 (3, 4) .",

Prior studies have shown that memory B-cell responses tend to be short lived after infection with SARS-CoV-1 (5, 6) . In contrast, memory T-cell responses can persist for many years (7) . Recent data confirm that SARS-CoV-2-specific memory CD8+ T cells are present in the vast majority of patients following recovery from COVID-19 (7) (8) (9) (10) , and their protective role has been inferred from studies in patients who have had both SARS and MERS (11) (12) (13) . Recent reports show that patients who have recovered from a severe SARS-CoV-2 infection have T-cell responses against viral spike protein and other structural and nonstructural proteins; in some patients, Tcell responses were present regardless of symptoms or antibody seropositivity (14) (15) (16) .

Furthermore, it was confirmed that CXCR6-CXCL16 interactions control the localization and maintenance of virus-specific CD8+ TRM cells in the lungs (20) . It has also been shown that, in heterosubtypic influenza challenge studies (30) (31) (32) , TRM were required for effective clearance of the virus. Therefore, vaccination strategies targeting generation of TRM and their persistence may provide enhanced immunity, compared with vaccines that rely on circulating responses (32) .",

The cell serves as the antigen supply to secreted gp96-Ig. Complexes of gp96-Ig and antigenic peptides lead to specific cross-presentation of cellderived antigens by gp96-Ig in vivo (33, 34) . A crucial advantage offered by this gp96-based technology platform is that it allows for any antigen (such as SARS-CoV-2 S peptides) in the complex with gp96 to drive a potent and long-standing immune response. Over the last 2 decades, we have established that gp96-Ig, secreted from allogeneic or xenogeneic cells containing selected infectious antigens, generates potent, disease antigen specific, polyepitope, multifunctional CD8+ T cells in epithelial tissues (33) (34) (35) (36) (37) (38) (39) . Here we generated a COVID-19 vaccine based on the secreted heat shock protein gp96-Ig vaccine strategy, and demonstrated vaccine-induced SARS-CoV-2 protein S-specific CD8+ and CD4+ T lymphocytes in epithelial tissues, including lungs and airways. The secreted gp96-Ig-COVID-19 vaccine has the potential to elicit robust long-term memory T-cell responses against multiple SARS-CoV-2 antigens and is designed to work cohesively with other treatments/ vaccines (as boosters or as second-line defense) with largescale manufacturing potential.",

Singlecolor samples were run for compensation and fluorescence minus 1 control sample were also applied to determine positive and negative populations, as well as channel spillover.",

We observed expression of full-length protein S (250 kDa) only in AD100 transfected cell lines (lanes 2-4) but not in nontransfected AD100 cell line (lane 1). In addition, we observed molecular weight bands of 120 and 130 kDa that could represent cleavage products of full length protein S (protein S1 and S2) and/or gp96-Ig fusion protein chaperoning the protein S peptides. The expected molecular weight of gp96-Ig fusion protein is 116 kDa. Additional bands, of~70 kDa, were found to be expressed only in the transfected cell line and were not observed in the nontransfected AD100 cells. However, nonspecific bands of 100, 60, and 40 kDa were observed in the AD100 parental cell line. Recombinant protein S1 130 kDa was used as a positive control. We calculated the ratio of protein S to b-actin expression ( Figure 1C ) and confirmed the expression of protein S by immunofluorescence ( Figure 1D ). We observed cytoplasmic and transmembrane distribution of protein S in AD100-gp96-Ig-S cell line.

The vaccination dose, is therefore, standardized to a set amount of gp96-Ig secreted by 10 6 vaccine cells within 24 h. It has been well established from our previous vaccine immunogenicity studies that the optimal dose for induction of CD8+ T cell specific responses in mice is 200-500 ng/ml (33, 35, 38, 39, 43) . Here, we used 200 ng/ml to immunize mice with AD100-gp96-Ig-S vaccine. Mice were vaccinated via the s.c. route and, after 5 days, the frequency of T cells within spleen, lungs (lung parenchyma), and BAL cells (lung airways) was determined. We observed significant increase in the frequencies of CD8+ T cells in the spleen and lungs, but not within the BAL of vaccinated mice (Figure 2A) . Frequency of CD4+ T cells was unchanged between vaccinated and control mice in all analyzed tissues. It is well established that vaccination with gp96-Ig induces CD8+ TEM differentiation (33, 37, 39) . Here, we confirmed that gp96-Ig-S vaccine primes strong effector memory CD8+ T-cell responses as determined by analysis of CD44 and CD62L expression ( Figure 2B) . Whereas the frequency of na\u00efve (N), CD44-CD62L+CD8 T cells and central memory (CM), CD44+CD62L+ CD8+ T cells was unchanged, we found statistically significant increase of TEM CD44+ CD62L-CD8+ T cells within the spleen and lungs ( Figure  2B ). In addition, we observed a trend of more TEM CD8+ T cells within the CD8+ T cells in the BAL ( Figure 2B) . TRM cells are a distinct memory T cell subset compared to CM and EM cells (44) that are uniquely situated in different tissues, including lungs (30, 31) . One of the canonical markers of TRM T cells is CD69 (20, 44, 45) . We found that there was a significant increase in the frequency of CD8+CD69+ T cells in vaccinated mice compared to control, non-vaccinated mice in both spleen and lungs ( Figure 2C) . Even though the frequency of CD8 +CD69+ T cells was the highest in the BAL compared to spleen and lungs, we did not observe a difference in their frequencies between vaccinated and control mice. Overall, vaccination with AD100-gp96-Ig-S induced robust TEM and CD69+ CD8+ T cell responses in both spleen and lungs. Our vaccine can therefore successfully elicit both systemic and tissue-specific immune response, which is pivotal in conferring robust immunity against infection such as against SARS-CoV-2.",

Five days after the vaccination of C57Bl6 mice, splenocytes and lung cells were isolated from vaccinated and control mice (PBS) and in vitro restimulated with S1 and S2 overlapping peptides from SARS-CoV-2 protein in the presence of protein transport inhibitor, brefeldin A for the last 5 h of culture. After 20 h of culture, ICS was performed to quantify protein Sspecific CD8+ and CD4+ T-cell responses. Cytokine expression in the presence of no peptides was considered background and it was subtracted from the responses measured from peptide pool stimulated samples for each individual mouse. (A, B) CD8+ T cells from spleen and lungs expressing IFNg, TNFa, and IL-2 in response to S1 and S2 peptide pool; (C, D) CD4+ T cells from spleen and lungs expressing IFNg, TNFa, and IL-2 in response to S1 and S2 peptide pool; (E) Representative dot plot of gated CD8+ T cells in lungs expressing indicated cytokines (IFNg; IL-2, and TNFa) in vaccinated and non-vaccinated (PBS, control) HLA-A2 mice at day 5 (F) Proportion of antigen (protein S)-experienced CD8+ and CD4+ T cells isolated from spleen and lung tissue expressing IFNg, TNFa, or IL-2 after o/n stimulation with S1 + S2 peptides.

Assessment of the mean proportion of cells making any combination of one to three cytokines (IFN-g, TNFa, IL-2). Data represent at least two technical replicates with three to six independent biologic replicates per group. *p<0.05, ***p<0.001. Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA with Dunn's multiple comparisons tests were applied. Asterisks (*) above or inside the column denote significant differences between indicated T cells producing cytokines in vaccine versus control (PBS) at 0.05 alpha level. ANOVA, analysis of variance; ICS, intracellular cytokine staining; IFN, interferon; IL, interleukin; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; TNF, tumor necrosis factor. IFNg (26.8%) was significantly reduced in the lungs (6.2%), while both TNFa and IL-2 productions were increased in the lungs (41% and 52%, respectively) compared to spleen (27.4% and 45.7%, respectively) ( Figure 3F ). We found that the proportion of the protein S-specific CD4+ T cells that produce IFNg was higher in the spleen than in the lungs [55.5% (spleen) versus 30.3% (lungs)], whereas IL-2 production was higher in the lungs than in the spleen [33% (lungs) versus 11.1% (spleen)] ( Figure 3F ). Further assessment of protein S-specific CD8+ and CD4+ T cells in the spleen and lungs revealed that the vast majority of protein Sspecific CD8+ and CD4+ T cells, irrespective of their location, synthesized only 1 cytokine ( Figure 3G) . It was therefore confirmed that a polyepitope, S-specific, CD4+, and CD8+ T cell response was generated in the spleen and lungs to different extents, providing a strong vaccine-induced Th1 cellular immune responses.",

Therefore, it is important to develop vaccines that can elicit SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T cells. Having identified overall T-cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 protein S (Figure 3) , we wanted to determine whether gp96-Ig-S vaccine induced HLA class I-specific cross-presentation of immunodominant SARS-CoV-2 protein S epitopes. In order to do this, we used transgenic HLA-A2.1 mice and HLA class I pentamers as probes to detect CD8+ T cells specific for two immunodominant SARS-CoV-2 protein S epitopes: YLQPRTFLL (YLQ) (aa 269-277) and FIAGLIAIV (FIA) (aa 1220-1228) in vaccinated mice ( Figures 4A-C) . We found that the vaccine effectively induces both YLQ+CD8+ T cells, as well as FIA+CD8+ T cells in the spleen, lungs, and BAL ( Figures 4A-C) . Interestingly, we found the highest frequency of YLQ+CD8+ T cells in the BAL of vaccinated mice and the lowest frequency of YLQ+ and FIA+ CD8+ T cells was observed in the lungs 5 days after primary vaccination. Importantly, we observed that after contraction of vaccine induced YLQ+CD8+ and FIA+CD8+ T cell responses in spleen, lungs and BAL, frequency of S-specific CD8+ T cell responses is preserved and it is significantly higher in BAL compared to non-vaccinated controls (Figures 4A-C) .",

            "text": "The principle of a cell-based vaccine relies on the ability of gp96-Ig to chaperone antigenic proteins to be efficiently endocytosed and cross-presented by activated dendritic cells (DC) to CD8+ T cells, thereby stimulating an avid, pathogenspecific T-cell response (33, 34, (37) (38) (39) . We adapted this cell-based technology to create a vaccine that delivers SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein directly to DCs, so that primed and activated SARS-CoV-2 protein S-specific CD8+ T cells can identify and kill SARS-CoV-2 infected lung epithelial cells. We generated vaccine cells by coexpressing secreted gp96-Ig and full-length protein S. Gp96-Ig is an endoplasmic reticulum chaperone that, together with TAP (transporter associated with antigen processing) and calreticulin in the endoplasmic reticulum, is thought to constitute a relay line for antigenic peptide transfer from the cytosol to MHC class I molecules in a concerted and regulated manner (49, 50) . The gp96antigenic peptide complexes are predominantly internalized by subsets of APCs through cell surface receptor CD91. Internalized gp96 can effectively present the associated peptides to MHC class I and II molecules and thus activate specific CD8+ and CD4+ T-cell responses (34, 39, 51, 52) . We expressed full-length protein S in the vaccine cells to ensure broad representation of all immunodominant protein S peptides (S1-and S2-derived peptides) by secreted gp96-Ig. Since coronaviruses assemble in the compartment between the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus (53, 54) and the S leader directs it to the endoplasmic reticulum, the native leader sequence of protein S was retained, as well as transmembrane and cytosolic domain. We confirmed in previous studies that secreted gp96-Ig provides immunologic specificity for the antigenic repertoire expressed inside the cells, including surrogate antigen ovalbumin, as well as numerous tumor or infectious antigens, but does not cross-immunize to different cell-derived antigens (35, (37) (38) (39) . Our data are consistent with the explanation that S1 and S2 peptides associated with secreted gp96-Ig are transferred to and presented by class I and II MHC and stimulate a S1-and S2-specific CD8+ and CD4+ T cell response. We confirmed that vaccination with AD100-gp96-Ig-S induces CD8+ T cells specific for S1-and S2-immunodominant epitopes in both lungs and airways. Most importantly, this is a proof-of-concept study that will be applied to other structural proteins such as nucleocapsid protein, membrane protein, and nonstructural proteins such as NSP-7, NSP-13 of ORF-1 that all have been reported to be important in induction of SARS-CoV-2specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses in convalescents (7, 10, 11, 55) . In agreement with our previous findings (33, 38, 39) , the gp96-Ig vaccine resulted in the preferential induction of CD8+ T cell responses systemically and in epithelial compartments. However, this is the first report about the increase in the frequencies of vaccine induced CD8+ T cells in the lungs ( Figure 1A) . TEM CD8+ T cells are considered to constitute the frontline defense within the different epithelial compartments including lungs and airways, which promptly recognize and kill infected cells. Our data suggest that after a single dose of AD100-gp96-Ig-S immunization there is preferential compartmentalization of TEM and TCM immune responses in the lungs and BAL compared to the spleen where a majority of cells are na\u00efve CD8+ T cells ( Figure 1B) . However, additional memory cells without migratory potential such as TRM CD8+ T cells, exist within the tissues including lungs and airways (20, 44, 45, 56) . Since TRM are uniquely situated in the lungs to immediately respond to reinfection, by inducing the protein-S-specific CD8+ T cells that home to the lungs, gp96-Ig-S vaccine provides an ideally balanced generation of both arms, TRM and TEM, of the memory response in the lungs. To further gauge the effect of gp96-Ig vaccination on the induction of epitope specific immunogenicity, we used pentamers to detect S1 and S2 epitope-specific CD8+ T cell responses. We found that gp96-Ig induced the highest frequencies of S1-and S2-epitope specific CD8+ T cells in the airways. In light of the new findings about exclusive highly clonally expanded SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T cells with preferentially expressed tissue-resident genes (XCL1, CXCR6, and ITGAE) in the BAL of moderate COVID-19 cases (57) and not in the critical/severe COVID-19 patients, induction of SARS-CoV-2 specific CD8+ T cells that home to airway epithelium emphasizes the importance of developing vaccination strategies that induce TRM antigen-specific CD8+ T cells that will improve efficacy of vaccination against respiratory pathogens including SARS-CoV-2.",

Priming of CD8+ T cells by CD103+ DC was found to promote TRM CD8+ T cell differentiation and migration into peripheral epithelial tissues, including lungs (56, 59) . Our previous studies indicated that gp96-Ig immunization increases frequency of CD11c high MHC class II high CD103+ cells at the vaccination site (33) . In light of our previous findings and findings of Bedoui et al. (60) that CD103+ DCs are the main migratory subtype with dominant cross-presenting ability, induction of CD103+ DCs by gp96 represents an ideal vaccination strategy for priming effective and durable immunity in the epithelial tissues. We also hypothesize that secretory gp96-Ig can be captured by lung DC upon s.c. inoculation and in that way directly induce tissue memory responses and even more importantly support their longevity in the tissue. It was previously shown that, based on differences in the localization and functions, there are two different subsets of lung TRM cells: airway TRM and interstitial TRM (61) (62) (63) . CXCR6-CXCL16 interactions are crucial in controlling the localization of virus-specific TRM CD8+ T cells in the lungs and maintaining the airway TRM cell pool (20) .",

Here, we showed that AD100-gp96-Ig-S resulted in the polyepitope and polyfunctional protein Sspecific CD8+ and CD4+ T cell responses (Figure 3) . When stimulated in vitro with S1+S2 peptides, spleen and lung CD8+ T cells produce IFNg, TNFa, and IL-2 cytokines ( Figure 3 ) with CD8+ T cells in the lungs producing significantly less IFNg than the CD8+ T cells in the spleen. It is known that enhanced activation, resulting from high levels of inflammation, induces CD8+ T cells entering the lungs to produce regulatory cytokines (64) that initiate \"dampening\" of the immune response in order to prevent any excessive damage of the lung tissue. In addition, we report that CD4+ T cells in the lungs produce all 3 Th1 cytokines in equal ratio ( Figure 3F ). This finding is in line with our previous report discussing gp96-Ig induced SIV-specific CD4+ T cells in the lamina propria which were almost the exclusive producers of IL-2 (33) . Further studies will therefore be required to evaluate the role of protein-S specific CD4+ T cells in the induction of B cell and antibody responses. Previously, we have shown that gp96 is a powerful Th1 adjuvant for CTL priming and for stimulation of Th1 type antibodies in mice and nonhuman primates (37, 38) . In addition, we will evaluate memory responses after a single and booster dose to establish the best vaccination protocol for future challenge studies.",

Structure-guided SARS-CoV-2 S protein combined with a safe and efficacious gp96-Ig vaccine platform can pave the way for a protective and durable immune response against COVID-19. This is a first demonstration of the utility and versatility of our proprietary secreted gp96-Ig SARS-CoV-2 vaccine platform that can be rapidly engineered and customized based on other and future pathogen sequences. Furthermore, the platform is proof of concept for the prototype vaccine approach for similar pathogens that require induction of effective TRM responses in epithelial tissues.",

Thirty days after the vaccination of HLA-A2 transgenic mice, splenocytes, and lung cells and BAL were isolated from vaccinated and control mice (PBS). Cells were stained with HLA-A2 02-01 pentamer containing SARS-CoV2 YLQPRTFLL peptide, followed by surface staining for CD45, CD3, CD4, CD8, CD69, CXCR6. Representative zebra plots of gated CD8+ T cells expressing indicated pentamer-specific TCR+ CD8+ T cells in vaccinated and non-vaccinated HLA-A2 mice at day 30. HLA-A2 pentamer containing HIV/SIV (HIV-1 gag) SLYNTVATL pentamer was used as a negative control pentamer.",
