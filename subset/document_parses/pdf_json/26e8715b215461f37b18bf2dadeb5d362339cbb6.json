Adolescents are believed to be at particular risk [5, 6] , as a critical period of psychosocial development and when most mental disorders emerge [7] . Lockdown measures such as stay-at-home orders and limits on social gatherings are at odds with adolescents' developmental propensity to prioritize peer relationships and seek greater autonomy from their parents [8e11]. Previous school closures had adverse associations with mental well-being and more pronounced effects are expected with COVID-19 [11, 12] . The youth were also restricted from engaging in many activities (e.g., recreation, sport) shown to help regulate emotions and promote mental health, whereas potentially detrimental exposures may have increased (e.g., family/home environment stress). Inequitable impacts by sex and gender have been hypothesized, with some evidence suggesting girls and females are at greater risk of adverse effects than boys and males [13e15] .",

In a sample of 451 U.S. adolescents and young adults, increases in generalized and social anxiety symptoms in all participants, and increased depression and panic/somatic symptoms in females only, were found based on surveys conducted between 2014 and 2019 and again in MarcheMay 2020 [14] . Similarly, an Australian study reported increased anxiety and depressive symptoms, and declines in life satisfaction, among 248 adolescents surveyed in the 12 months before the pandemic and two months after implementation of government restrictions and online learning [15] . Greater mental health declines were found among females than males [15] . However, modest effect sizes led the authors to conclude that most adolescents are coping well and showing minimal negative impact in the early stages of the pandemic [19] . Contrary to expectations, in a primarily Hispanic/Latinx sample of 322 early adolescents in a Southwestern U.S. city, internalizing symptoms declined from assessments conducted pre-COVID-19 to three time points during the pandemic [20] . Inconsistencies across prospective studies may reflect differences in sample demographics, timing of assessments, regional COVID-19 prevalence and lockdown measures, and social support systems available. Furthermore, adjustment for age-related changes over time is necessary, given evidence of increases in anxiety and depressive symptoms and reduced life satisfaction across adolescence [21, 22] .",

First, mean potential outcomes (i.e., estimated average adjusted predictions) and average treatment effects were obtained using Stata 15 structural equation modeling (SEM) and generalized SEM routines (StataCorp, 2017). We used a lagged dependent variable, where mental health in the prior year predicted mental health in following wave. We used a fixed effect method using SEM as recommended by Allison [34] , given the advantages of simultaneously controlling for time-invariant unobserved confounders and producing final estimates for timeinvariant predictors (sex and age at entry into the 2018 cohort). A structural model was assessed for each of the three outcomes; each model included three equations (one for each year). Following Allison's [334] approach, each set of equations included a vector of invariant predictors (sex, age at entry into the cohort) as well as a latent term (alpha) representing all other unobserved stable differences between individuals. The full information maximum likelihood method was used to control for missing data. Robust estimators accounted for school clustering.",

The hypothesis of a different progression in mental health outcomes in each of the two periods was tested using a difference-in-differences design [36e38], which provides an estimation of the average effect of the COVID-19 pandemic and early lockdown response on participant mental health. Difference-in-differences calculations were performed in three steps. First, the mean predicted values are obtained under the counterfactual scenarios. Second, simple differences are computed by subtracting the mean potential outcomes across the two periods (i.e., pre-COVID-19 period [2019 minus 2018] and the early COVID-19 period [2020 minus 2019]). Third, the causal effect is estimated using difference-in-differences, by subtracting the difference in the early COVID-19 period (2020 minus 2019) from the difference in the pre-COVID-19 period (2019 minus 2018).

This natural experiment study is among the first to evaluate the effect of the early pandemic response on the mental health of Canadian adolescents in a prospective cohort with prepandemic data. Using survey data linked across three study waves and adjusting for self-selection bias, there was no evidence of an adverse effect of the COVID-19 initial lockdown on the mental health of adolescents in Ontario and Quebec, Canada. Although mental health generally deteriorated from 2019 to 2020, the decline was less than would have typically been expected over this time period based on changes found over pre-COVID-19 waves. In fact, the increase in depression and anxiety symptoms from 2019 to spring 2020 was about half of the change found over the same time period a year prior, and flourishing declined by approximately 90% less than the 2018-to-2019 change. Neither sex nor age at entry into the cohort appeared to be risk factors for greater deterioration of mental health between the two periods. Although females had higher internalizing symptoms and poorer psychosocial well-being across all three waves, the effect of the early COVID-19 pandemic response appears largely parallel across sex. Continued prospective analysis is needed over the prolonged and fluctuating course of the pandemic, with schools reopening and closing again in the subsequent waves.",

Results of the few extant prospective studies with prepandemic data have been mixed [14, 15, 20] . Magson et al.

We found continued declines in mental health across all three waves, albeit to a lesser extent in the early pandemic response period than in the pre-COVID-19 period. Essentially, pandemic measures put a pause on many adolescents' day-to-day lives, with schools closed to in-person learning, canceled extracurricular activities (sports, recreation, etc.), and limits to face-to-face social interactions outside of household members. School closures may have also allowed more family time and respite for the youth with adverse school experiences [1] . This interruption appears to have blunted age-related deterioration in mental health during adolescence [22, 39] . However, although some causal or risk factors in the pre-COVID-19 period may have been temporarily abated, it remains plausible that new concerns introduced by the pandemic response contributed to continued increases in depression and anxiety symptoms. It is important to note that our analysis only allows comparison of the relative magnitude of changes; we are unable to determine the mechanisms responsible for mental health changes in either the pre-COVID-19 or the early pandemic response period. In a Swiss study, the approximately one in five young adults who reported feeling better than before the pandemic had an appreciation for the opportunity to slow down, relax and rest, spend more time with family and close friends, engage in hobbies, and sleep and the removal of educational pressures [40] . The authors note the importance of considering findings in the context of secular trends of increasing reports of psychological distress and internalizing symptoms among the Western youth [40] . More attention is needed to explore contributing factors in the school context or other aspects of adolescents' lives that were disrupted (e.g., academic-related stress, bullying, school schedules) or new influences that were introduced (e.g., greater family and/or sleep time) that explain these findings.",

Wade et al.

Results were generally equivalent for depression and anxiety; however, the early pandemic response appears to have diminished increases in internalizing symptoms to a lesser degree than the declines in psychosocial well-being. Flourishing scores were generally comparable across 2019 and spring 2020, unlike the decline found between 2018 and 2019. Factors contributing to pre-COVID-19 trends in depression and anxiety symptoms over time may have been less disrupted by the lockdown than those responsible for declines in psychosocial well-being. For instance, depression and anxiety have a large biological susceptibility [43] , with most mental disorders having their onset in adolescence [7] . The dual continuum model highlights potential to promote mental health among all and the need for targeted prevention of mental illness among higher-risk populations. Further research is needed to examine differential impacts in adolescents with pre-existing mental ill-health.",

Several limitations require mention. Although self-report data are prone to recall and social desirability bias, COMPASS uses passive consent protocols which are shown to better reach students at risk of depression [24] and does not require student names, helping to preserve perceptions of anonymity for honest reporting. In terms of the statistical models, we built counterfactuals in the absence of a possible comparison group, but difference-in-differences designs are limited by assuming parallel trends; therefore, there is no control for within-individual variations over time related to time-varying unobserved characteristics (e.g., changes in socioeconomic status). Future studies are needed to examine modifying effects of socioeconomic status, which require a different analytic approach. The change from school-based paper-and-pencil questionnaires to online assessment may have influenced reports. The lower online response rates may bias the results; students not responding may be at higher risk of adverse mental health impacts. We corrected for self-selection by adjusting for factors that predicted participation in the 2020 wave (age, sex, weekly spending money, province, school connectedness). However, the consistency of estimates may be affected if there are departures from the statistical assumptions of sample selection models (e.g., assuming error terms that are jointly normally distributed). Finally, as COMPASS was not designed to be representative, results may not be generalizable to all Canadian adolescents.",

In a three-year cohort of Canadian adolescents, we found no evidence of an adverse effect of the early pandemic response on mental health. Although mental health deteriorated across all waves, the decline in the early COVID-19 period was relatively less than expected based on the pre-COVID-19 period. The lockdown interruptions appear to have diminished anticipated deteriorations in mental health. These deteriorations seen over time have implications as we move toward lifting pandemic measures and highlight the importance of considering opportunities to establish a \"new normal\" that is more supportive of mental health and the prevention of mental illness among the youth. Further prospective research is needed to explore changes over the prolonged and unpredictable course of the pandemic and inequitable impacts among subgroups at greater risk.",
