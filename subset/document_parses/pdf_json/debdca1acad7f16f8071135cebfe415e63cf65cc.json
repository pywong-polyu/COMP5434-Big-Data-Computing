This patient, a five-year-old Hispanic female child was brought to our emergency department on March 21, 2020, with fever, productive cough, shortness of breath with chest tightness, abdominal pain, and diarrhea for a week. Her condition deteriorated rapidly, and she developed sepsis within 24 hours, needing intensive care unit admission and ventilator support. She tested negative for COVID-19 Biofire \u00ae nucleic acid tests (BioFire Diagnostics, Salt Lake City, Utah 84108 USA); however, she was recently exposed to COVID-19 cases at her school. This case highlights the importance of a high index of COVID-19 suspicion in children in the endemic areas despite negative COVID-19 tests for keeping a watchful eye to prevent sudden deterioration and unexpected complications.",

Generally, children and young adults seem to be at lower risk; however, there are many recent cases where children had atypical presentations and unexpected complications [2, 3] . Children were thought to be less susceptible to COVID-19 at the beginning of the pandemic, but as new cases are unfolding rapidly, many cases of children, including neonates and teenagers, are progressively being reported in the literature [4] . Most children acquire the disease after direct contact with COVID-19 family members or close contacts [5] . Here, we report a pediatric case with a clinical picture consistent with COVID-19 that rapidly progressed to sepsis with persistent hypertension.",

This was also observed in a retrospective observational study by Xia et al. involving 20 pediatric COVID-19 patients [13] . They found that the majority of their patients (70%) showed normal WBC findings. Another retrospective case series of 67 patients involving both adults and children showed that during the early phases of COVID-19, there was no significant decline in lymphocyte count; however, neutrophils decreased in children compared to adults (P=0.02) [15] . In our case, the patient had normal WBC and lymphocytes on the day of admission, but her overall WBCs and neutrophils became elevated as a result of sepsis on the second day.",

As a result of viral infection, white blood cell and lymphocyte counts can be reduced by consumption. However, similar results did not appear in our study, with only a total of six cases, including one case of a child with decreased lymphocyte counts. The value of lymphocyte counts showed no significant differences in children over six years compared with adults. On the other hand, neutrophil counts decreased in children compared with adults (P=0.02). So, lymphocyte decline is not an essential indicator for the diagnosis of childhood cases, and the neutrophil count decline should be focused on. These may be due to a lower inflammatory response in children.",

In our case, the child did not test positive for COVID-19, but the symptoms were consistent with it, and her general condition rapidly deteriorated, needing PICU admission and intubation. Many of these clinical worsenings may be attributed to co-infection with other viruses. This study highlights the possibility of rapid deterioration and sepsis in a child in a suspected COVID-19 case despite negative viral evidence. Therefore, it is crucial to consider the presumptive diagnosis of COVID-19 in every child with a typical clinical picture and suspected history of exposure, particularly from current endemic areas, and remain vigilant in its progression.",
