The outbreak of diseases has significantly impacted the lives of millions of people and within a year, several vaccines have been developed to control the pandemia.

Patients described in the studies were healthy or in medically-stable condition without any previous history of thromboses. Notably, a high percentage of the patients had thrombosis at unusual sites in particular at cerebral venous sinus with a median platelet count at diagnosis of approximately 20,000 to 30,000 per cubic millimeter. [4] [5] [6] In addition to the signs and symptoms of the syndrome and the post-vaccination concomitance, the interesting fact that correlates the individual cases with each other is the high level of antibodies to platelet factor 4 (PF4)polyanion complexes. These are platelet-activating antibodies which clinically mimic autoimmune heparininduced thrombocytopenia (HIT). Indeed, in some heparin-treated patients, the drug combines with a protein produced by platelets, PF4, to form a complex. The binding of the anti-heparin/PF4 antibody to the heparin-PF4 complex activates the platelets, leading to their aggregation and thrombocytopenia. 7 However, unlike the usual situation in HIT, these vaccinated patients did not receive any heparin to explain the later onset of thrombosis and thrombocytopenia.",

Some of the authors have described two cases of malignant middle cerebral artery (MCA) infarction with a concomitant thrombocytopenia within 10 days after vaccination with ChAdOx1 nCoV-19. 8 Thus, in the present study we analyze in these two patients antibody specificity and the signaling transduction pathway involved in platelet activation in detail.",

Then, whole extracts proteins (40 \u00b5g/sample) were separated in 10% SDS-PAGE. Proteins were electrophoretically transferred to PVDF membranes (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Richmond, CA, USA) and then, after blocking with Tris-buffered saline Tween 20 (TBS-T) 3% BSA, incubated with polyclonal rabbit anti-phospho-ERK1/2 (Cell Signaling, Inc., Danvers, MA, USA), polyclonal rabbit anti-phospho-p38 antibodies (Cell Signaling, Inc.) Antibody reactions were visualized by horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Sigma-Aldrich, Milan, Italy), and then by the chemiluminescence reaction, using ehnanced chemiluminescence western blot system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Buckinghamshire, UK).

Human platelets from healthy donors were treated with immunoglobulin G (IgG) fractions from the 2 patients and from a healthy donor vaccinated with ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (10 minutes for ERK and p38 activation and 4 hours for tissue factor [TF] analysis). Protein extracts were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by western blot to investigate phosphorylated ERK (A), p38 MAPK (B), and TF (C), using anti-phospho-ERK1/2, anti-phospho-p38 and anti-TF antibodies, respectively. Data are reported as mean \u00b1 standard deviation from 3 Results show that the treatment with both IgG fractions from patients with VITT, induced a significant increase of both phospho-ERK ( Figure 1A ) and phospho-p38 expression ( Figure 1B ) compared to untreated platelets or treated with healthy donor IgG obtained from a representative healthy donor vaccinated with ChAdOx1 nCoV-19. As a consequence of ERK activation, we also observed a significant increase of TF levels in treated platelets. Moreover, pretreatment with ERK inhibitor PD98059 partially prevented TF expression in samples stimulated with patient IgG fractions ( Figure  1C) , indicating a functional link between ERK activation and TF expression.",

In autoimmune-HIT, anti-PF4/P-antibodies activate platelets in the absence of heparin. In the present study we observed for the first time that IgG fractions of these patients are able to trigger a signal transduction pathway involving ERK and p38 MAPK, which may lead to TF expression increase with a consequent amplification of platelet activation and coagulation cascade. 11 We cannot exclude the possibility that other additional signal transduction pathways may be involved.",
