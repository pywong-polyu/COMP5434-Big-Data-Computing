The current outbreak of infections with SARS-CoV-2 was termed COVID-19 by the WHO. 3 The disease rapidly spread from Wuhan to other areas of the world, so that the WHO announced that the outbreak was a pandemic in March 2020. 4 The first paediatric case was a 10-year-old Chinese boy, whose family had visited Wuhan City. 4 A retrospective study on 366 children hospitalised for respiratory infections in January 2020 confirmed COVID-19 infection in 6 (1.6%) of them. This study suggests that COVID-19 infections in children occurred early in the epidemic. 5 Children were rarely tested for the virus in the earlier phase of the outbreak, so there are limited data on the prevalence of COVID-19 in children. 6 The virus can produce a Kawasaki-like illness in children. WHO developed a preliminary case definition for this condition which was later named 'multisystem inflammatory disorder' in COVID-19 (MIS-C). 7 In Iran, the first COVID-19 cases were detected in February 2020 in Qom city. There are a few reports from critically ill paediatric patients in the country. In this article, we describe the characteristics of paediatric patients with COVID-19 admitted in paediatric intensive care unit (PICU) of Namazi Hospital in Shiraz, Iran.",
