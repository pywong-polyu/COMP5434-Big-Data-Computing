Although the idea of investigating nuclear medicine-based solutions for treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is interesting and is potentially deserving of comment, the commentary by Pillarsetty et al. raises some concerns.",

Without the ability to use animal models, we nevertheless recognized that the uncertainty, the general dearth of knowledge, and the rapidly evolving situation at that time merited publication of our data as a Brief Communication to provoke thought and discussion on a potential approach to treating this disease.Regarding the third point: the suggested references, including some interesting papers authored by Dr. Dadachova, were not appropriate for this Brief Communication because they do not address Auger therapy. Future publication of the ongoing studies may warrant citation of this work.Lastly, the critical advantage of Auger therapy, as described in our Brief Communication, is that Auger electron cascades are highly localized, providing potential advantages over other forms of ionizing radiation when it comes to destroying virions. The letter's final point references the \"18 kGy of radiation\" required for sterilization of bone ",
