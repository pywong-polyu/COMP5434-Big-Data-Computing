Both clinical and engineering groups around the globe have responded through the development of \"homemade\" or do-it-yourself (DIY) ventilators. Several designs have been prototyped, tested, and shared over the internet. However, many open source DIY ventilators require extensive familiarity with microcontroller programming and electronics assembly, which many healthcare providers may lack. In light of this, we designed and bench tested a low-cost, pressure-controlled mechanical ventilator that is \"plug and play\" by design, where no end-user microcontroller programming is required. This Fast-AssembLy COVID-Nineteen (FALCON) emergency prototype ventilator can be rapidly assembled and could be readily modified and improved upon to potentially provide a ventilatory option when no other is present, especially in low-and middle-income countries.",

Commercial ventilators are expensive devices due to numerous features and multiple modes, commonly costing over 25,000 USD. Most hospitals operate with an adequate but limited supply of ventilators as purchase and maintenance costs can be prohibitive (Heather Glass, 2019) . A low reserve of ventilators means healthcare capacity could be overwhelmed by a large healthcare crisis. A number of guidelines have been published regarding the management of medical resources, including mechanical ventilators, during emergency and disaster surge situations (Aziz et al., 2020; Frederick and White, 2020; Maves et al., 2020) .",

However, satisfactory ventilator supply has posed a greater challenge in rural, low-and middle-income communities (LMICs), where obtaining and maintaining conventional medical-grade mechanical ventilators is not feasible (Gu\u00e9rin and L\u00e9vy, 2020) . For example, African countries averaged less than 1 ventilator per 100,000 people, at least twenty times lower the rate of the United States, at the start of the pandemic (Houreld et al., 2020) . India, a middle-income country, was estimated to have less than 5 ventilators per 100,000 (Soutik, 2020) . Furthermore, conventional ventilators that require pressurized gasses to operate cannot be reliably used where access to dependable pressurized gas is unavailable (Fenton, 2020; Madzimbamuto, 2020) .",

While potentially very useful clinically, most healthcare centers cannot assemble and program such devices. In light of these challenges, we designed a low-cost, \"plug and play\" time-cycled pressure-controlled mechanical ventilator requiring no end-user programming. This simplified design platform can be easily assembled for use by healthcare workers with applications in emergency and disaster surge situations, especially in LMICs, when other preferred ventilatory options are unavailable. We hypothesized that our Fast-AssembLy COVID-Nineteen (FALCON) emergency prototype ventilator could reproduce pressure/flow waveforms and tidal volumes similar to a hospital grade ventilator (Engstr\u00f6m Carestation TM ) in a variety of benchtop tests.",

In computer systems engineering, \"plug and play\" refers to a feature where peripheral hardware functions immediately as intended once connected without the need for the end-user to manually adjust or reconfigure settings (OED, 2020) . Similarly, we use the term \"plug and play\" to mean that the component parts of the ventilator should work as intended after assembly without the need for the end-user to program or upload any software or code to a microcontroller. For this reason, the use of programmable microcontrollers such as \"Arduino\" or \"Raspberry Pi\" and peripheral input devices necessitating the development and use of specialized coding or programming was deliberately avoided. However, even within such constraints, the prototype ventilator should maintain adequate functionality sufficient for emergency use; in particular, the control and setting of PIP, PEEP, respiratory rate (RR), and inspiratory: expiratory (I:E) ratio.",

All the necessary parts used to assemble the ventilator are shown in Figure 1B , with the exception of a pressure gauge, and a list of purchased parts for assembling the prototype ventilator is found in the Supplementary Material. Respiratory rate is set by a timer relay (XY-LJ02, Belong International Co., Shanghai, China). A 12-volt 8-amp electric air pump (Quick-Fill DC Electric Air Pump AP636, Intex, Long Beach, CA, United States; maximal air flow 650 L/min) provides air flow and pressure delivered to the recipient. The timer relay continuously alternates between \"ON\" and \"OFF\" states, controlling the air pump at times set on the programmable relay. The operator sets the inspiratory and expiratory times by setting the durations of the \"ON\" and \"OFF\" states, respectively. The air pump is controlled by two pulse width modulators (PWMs; 12-40V 8A PWM DC, Riorand TM , Richmond, Canada) one PWM for PIP (\"ON\") pressure state and a second PWM control for the PEEP (\"OFF\") state. A pressure gauge (NS 60 PBS; Instrumentation Industries Inc, Bethel Park, PA, United States), is used to confirm pressures and adjust the PIP and PEEP values by effectively altering the current delivered to the air pump during \"ON\" and \"OFF\" states, respectively. The timer relay is powered by a 5-volt 1-amp micro USB power adapter (PT-WC-05, UorMe, Shanghai, China) and micro USB to USB cable (HST-SMT3001, SmallElectric, Dongguan, China). With the exception of the pressure gauge, all parts together were purchased for less than 75 USD. Importantly, our design requires no soldered connections, only 13 screw terminals, and 3 wire cap connections; the wiring diagram is shown in Figure 1C .

            "text": "The FALCON ventilator is a stable disaster/emergency \"plug and play\" ventilator that can be readily and rapidly assembled from widely available and inexpensive components. Several other groups have also developed mechanical ventilators, and many of these designs have been shared on the web as \"open-source\" platforms with several diverse features (Frazer et al., 2020) . Several of the proposed designs have not yet been assembled; fewer have been tested for utility, and end users may have to fill in gaps of assembly and programming with unspecified hardware and software (Pearce, 2020) . Many of these ventilator designs generate pressure and flow through mechanical compression of a self-inflating bag valve mask, or BVM (Blacker et al., 2020; MIT Emergency Ventilator, 2020a) . Bag ventilation relies on adjustment of manual compression to provide volume-controlled ventilation. Many bag-based ventilators contain mechanical moving parts that can operationally fail during the lifetime of the ventilator (MIT Emergency Ventilator, 2020b). Another recent and inexpensive (\u223c10 USD) \"minimalist\" prototype ventilator by Chi et al. is 3D printed, and it relies on pressurized gas either from an air tank or hospital wall supply to accomplish ventilation (Albert et al., 2020) . While inexpensive, reliance on pressurized gas may also be impractical during emergency surge crises, especially in LMICs when pressurized gas may not be readily accessible or sufficiently pressurized (Fenton, 2020; Madzimbamuto, 2020) . Other prototype ventilators use low-cost electric fans or blowers to produce pressure-controlled ventilation. Garmendia et al. (2020) designed and tested this type of low-cost, fan-powered ventilator that could even be used in non-invasive ventilation scenarios. However, the use of complex, microcontroller programming and peripheral input/output devices remain significant barriers to assembly and use by end-users. Even when all files and instructions are made available to the end-user, assembly, initialization, and calibration may be required for operation. Therefore, we designed the FALCON as a basic pressurecontrolled ventilator that can be assembled without the use of sophisticated microcontrollers. PIP and PEEP values measured over a 5-day testing period were highly consistent, demonstrating minimal pressure \"drift\" over time. Such consistent pressure delivery are essential; variations in pressures could lead to ventilator induced lung injury if pressures are too high or hypoxemia and respiratory acidosis if pressures are too low. Furthermore, ventilator failure is of particular concern with \"homemade\" ventilators. For example, bag valve mask ventilators are at risk of mechanical failure due to the use of several moving parts (Nacharaju et al., 2020) . The lack of either mechanical or electrical failures during the 5-day testing period supports the robustness of the FALCON prototype ventilator. Nevertheless, the proper functioning of the FALCON prototype ventilator is critically dependent upon the performance of the selected electric air pump and its internal turbine.",

This approach produces more rounded pressure and flow curves compared to the Carestation TM , reflecting rotational inertia of the air pump's internal fan, as the fan takes a fraction of the expiratory time to passively slow down and stop. At high enough respiratory rates with low target PEEP, there may be insufficient time for the turbine to decelerate, leading to above-target PEEP. This was observed in the progression of increased PEEP from test condition 1 (RR = 10 breaths per min, measured PEEP = 0.5 cm H 2 O), to test condition 7 (RR = 20 breaths per min, measured PEEP = 1.5 cm H 2 O), and finally to test condition 13 (RR = 30 breaths per min, measured PEEP = 2.6 cm H 2 O).",

We acknowledge that our prototype would therefore not be appropriate for patients with severe ARDS whose lung compliance could be lower, and airway resistance higher, than the tested values. These patients would be ideally treated with a commercial ICU ventilator, where the FALCON prototype would represent an intermediate treatment approach which could make more sophisticated and expensive ICU ventilators available.

Mandatory ventilation has some important disadvantages over assisted/supported ventilation. These can include greater use of sedatives/neuromuscular blockade as well as diaphragmatic dysfunction. Both factors can prolong the need for mechanical ventilation and carry risk for apnea upon ventilator failure (Kress et al., 2000; Sassoon et al., 2004; Gilstrap and MacIntyre, 2013) which anticipates the need for more continuous patient monitoring. In our model, we explored the addition of controls for patient synchrony but realized this would substantially increase the complexity of the FALCON ventilator and reduce its \"plug and play\" utility. Therefore, it is important to restate that the FALCON ventilator is not intended to replace ICU ventilators for prolonged ventilation but was designed chiefly as a low-cost temporary ventilatory option in surge crises until patients can be transitioned to more conventional, longer-term medical/ICU ventilators.",

Depending on the ventilatory circuit set up, the FALCON prototype ventilator should be at similar risk to contamination as more conventional hospital-grade ventilators and should undergo similar cleaning and disinfection protocols (World Health Organization, 2014) . In particular, the use of a three-way, twoposition pneumatically driven valve, such as those commonly found in BVMs between the bag outlet and mask, could be used to set up inspiratory (from ventilator to valve) and expiratory (from valve to atmosphere) lines with a common line from the valve to the patient. This setup should prevent most respiratory secretions from entering the inspiratory line and contaminating the electric air pump. Additionally, respiratory HEPA filters can be placed along the inspiratory and expiratory lines to eliminate significant viral particle aerosolization (Ari et al., 2016; Ari, 2020; Directorate of Health Services, 2020; Fink et al., 2020) . After use, this ventilator can be unplugged and housing surfaces cleaned with conventional solutions used for highly infectious materials, such as 0.26% sodium hypochlorite (Directorate of Health Services, 2020). Ventilator tubing may be reused if it is thoroughly washed with detergent, rinsed, and then subjected to a disinfection solution, such as 0.1% sodium hypochlorite, ensuring that the tubing is flushed adequately (World Health Organization, 2014) . Due to the \"plug and play\" nature of the ventilator, if an electrical component does inadvertently become contaminated, it can be replaced relatively inexpensively.",
