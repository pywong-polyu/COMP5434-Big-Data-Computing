However, the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted a new set of hazards to this workforce, with a risk of infection reported in 1 study to be 12-fold higher for frontline health care professionals than for the general population. 1 Discourse regarding mitigating risk for health care professionals, including physicians, nurses, and advanced practice providers, has largely focused upon individual-level considerations, such as underlying health conditions. However, to our knowledge, no studies or recommendations have addressed the broader risk and burden these frontline workers have assumed with regard to their families. Families that are particularly vulnerable to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, henceforth referred to as vulnerable households, include (1) dual health care professional households, (2) households in which the health care professional is a single parent, and (3) households with health care professionals who live with or care for a high-risk family member (i.e., an older adult or immunocompromised person). COVID-19 offers the opportunity to reflect upon how vulnerable households can be supported now and in future health emergencies.",

Dual health care professional households represent a significant portion of the medical workforce. A 2020 survey of U.S. physicians found that 25% of women and 16% of men were married to a physician and that an additional 11% of women and 35% of men were married to nonphysician health care providers. 2 An analysis of data from 2018 to 2020 from the U.S. Current Population Survey found that almost 7% of U.S. health care workers live in single-parent households; this group has the greatest representation by nursing, psychiatric, and home health care aides; medical assistants; and licensed practical and licensed vocational nurses. 3 Due to the heterogeneity and dynamics of family situations, prevalence data are not available for households in which health care professionals care for, or live with, high-risk family members. And the composition of these 3 groups of vulnerable households is diverse as well. If there are 2 health care professionals in a family, they may be from different departments, hospitals, or organizations, or, in some cases, they may even be working in different states. And singleparent or caretaker households may have family members or partners who assist with childcare who are themselves employed in other essential work sectors. Lastly, given the negative economic impact of an infectious pandemic or other health emergency, household composition may itself be dynamic because many families experience additional financial and psychological pressures as a result of furloughs and layoffs in the health care and other industries.",

There are psychosocial and other challenges for those with college-age or adult children rejoining households due to the pandemic, as well as for the significant number of providers who care for aging family members at home or oversee their care remotely. Health care professionals providing direct patient care during times of infectious outbreaks are already at higher risk of psychological distress than those not involved in direct patient care. Health care professionals who are also parents of dependent children, who are socially isolated due to quarantine, or who have infected family members are particularly vulnerable. 5 For those who choose to self-isolate to protect their families, this decision carries a significant psychological and emotional burden and places additional strain on already thin support networks. 6, 7 The COVID-19 pandemic continues to touch each household in various ways, though the difficult balance of professional and family responsibilities is undoubtedly a common thread.

Those with older children noted the stress placed on children who understood the risk their parents were taking but who might not be developmentally equipped to process that stress. Additionally, children seemed acutely aware of the longer duty hours and parental absence even when 1 parent might be home but navigating telehealth patient care or attending virtual meetings. Regardless of the ages of their children, our colleagues reported concerns for keeping children safe from exposure to SARS-CoV-2 when both parents were actively providing patient care, noting that self-quarantine in the home is a challenging task.",

Individuals in these partnerships may have very different coping mechanisms in response to the new responsibilities presented by COVID-19 both at work and in the home, leading to an additional layer of stress. Some colleagues noted that it can be challenging to even acknowledge these internal struggles to themselves or their partners, let alone their section or departmental leadership. Finally, social distancing means fewer opportunities for informal conversation with colleagues about these issues and less chance for mutual support from those experiencing similar pressures. Following this solicitation of reflections from our colleagues, Department of Internal Medicine leaders shared these concerns at a department-wide town hall and encouraged open communication and proactive planning to mitigate these challenges. Several faculty members reflected that simply having the open dialogue was therapeutic and validating.",

Finally, around the country-including in the area surrounding the Yale School of Medicine-we saw the mobilization of locally available volunteer networks to support health care professionals during the pandemic.

It is prudent for leadership to acknowledge that academic scholarship is likely to suffer as a result of increased caregiving demands.

The details of a health care professional's personal life may be unknown to those tasked with meeting staffing needs as, in accordance with federal and state antidiscrimination laws, employers should not collect detailed information about employees' family situations at the time of hiring. Therefore, when creating emergency staffing policies during a time of crisis, employers are encouraged to solicit input about personal concerns from workers. The success of this recommendation hinges first on creating a work environment in which health care providers feel comfortable voicing their concerns. Amid the many priorities they are balancing, leaders should acknowledge that the challenges vulnerable households face in the time of widespread infectious outbreaks or other states of emergency are a priority worth proactively planning for. This acknowledgment may require a cultural shift in health care institutions, whereby the needs of family units are explicitly considered as an important part of the complex equation of planning clinical deployments during crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic.",
