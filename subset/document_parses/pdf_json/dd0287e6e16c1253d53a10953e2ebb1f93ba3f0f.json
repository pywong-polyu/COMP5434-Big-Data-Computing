At the Hospital for Special Surgery (HSS), this service is called the Peri-operative Pain Services (POPS) and is an extension of the Department of Anesthesiology, Critical Care, and Pain Management. The team consists of three full time physicians, all with a background in pain management and palliative care, six advanced practice providers (APPs), and two licensed clinical social workers (with additional staffing provided by anesthesia residents and fellows as needed). POPS averages about 1000 visits across all services per month.",

Our partners at NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital (NYP) faced a significant challenge due to the surge of patients being admitted for acute respiratory distress syndrome related to infection with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. HSS alleviated their burden initially by accepting non-COVID-19 patients who needed further medical management. These included patients with pain issues such as sickle cell crisis and opioid tolerance. Some of these patients were transferred from NYPH on ventilator support to our critical care unit. Eventually, HSS received COVID-19 patients requiring ventilator support as well as supplemental oxygen support. HSS also opened an orthopedic triage center to divert emergent orthopedic cases from area hospitals. These cases included many patients with COVID-19, and more often than not complex medical comorbidities.",

The consults varied in nature and severity, ranging from symptom management to determining goals of care or end of life care.

As palliative care providers, team members updated the patients' family members with prognostic information and discussed goal-of-care decisions for their loved ones. Decisions regarding palliative/terminal extubation involved the entire medical team including consultation with our bioethics team. The number of palliative care consults in the month of April 2020 alone was four times that of the entire 2019 calendar year. The pre-existing palliative care service could have easily become overwhelmed. The use of pain management providers as palliative care providers enabled complex symptom management, decision-making advocacy and education, and a compassionate response to crisis management. Members of the POPS/palliative care team also educated staff members on health care proxies and advanced directives. The hospital's do-not-resuscitate (DNR) policies were updated to reflect the demands of the pandemic, and updates were distributed along with copies of the New York State Medical Orders for Life Sustaining Treatments (MOLSTs) to the inpatient units.",

The surge of COVID-19 patients admitted to our hospital had families who needed to be supported and to remain involved in health care decisionmaking. The formation of the Family Medical Communications Team (FMCT) by the Department of Anesthesiology, Critical Care, and Pain Management along with the Service Excellence Department added yet another layer of support. The goals of the FMCT were twofold: to provide support to patients and families and to allow the critical care team to focus on delivery of the highest quality care. The FMCT included a voluntary group of anesthesiologists and medical physicians, whose in-hospital work activities were curtailed due to postponement of elective surgeries. This service was coordinated by the clinical director for POPS. In addition, every attending physician in POPS was involved with the service, whether it was fulfilling the supporting role with the family or intervening as palliative care consultants. The physicians were able to access the electronic health record from home and take on the role of communicators between the intensivist taking care of the patient and the patient's family members. Service excellence was instrumental in determining the appropriate contact or surrogate decision maker. The communicator established a relationship with the patient's medical decision-maker and served as a liaison to the critical care team. The FMCT members provided a much-needed supportive role to patient families and to the critical care team.",

Each family needed unique support, whether it was help with funeral arrangements or assistance getting family finances in order.

In an effort to create a supportive environment, twice weekly Zoom support groups were set up for staff members to discuss their experiences, share tips, or air grievances.
