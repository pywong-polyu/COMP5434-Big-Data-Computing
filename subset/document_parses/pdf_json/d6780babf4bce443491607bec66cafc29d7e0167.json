But although fish catches are usually considered the primary ecosystem service that benefits fishers, little is known about how subjective well-being is influenced by the fishing activity itself. Here, we applied the experience sampling method in two small-scale fisheries in Bangladesh to assess the effects of fishing on fishers' occurrence of positive and negative affect, two measures of subjective well-being. We found that fishing activities were not directly associated with increased momentary affect and that the frequency of positive affect actually decreased as the fishing trip progressed. Furthermore, although very low catches were associated with less positive affect, the highest frequency of positive affect was achieved with relatively small catches. Our results imply that the benefits provided by small-scale fisheries to the momentary subjective wellbeing of fishers are not strongly related to the actual catching of fish.",

In addition, small-scale fisheries are deeply associated with people's identity, social norms and lifestyle, all of which create a strong attachment to fishing (Pollnac and Poggie 2008; Cinner 2014) . Fishing has been associated with subjective well-being-feelings of happiness and satisfaction-because fishing activities are linked with communities' culture, identity and social cohesion through multiple dimensions (Weeratunge et al. 2014; Allison et al. 2020) . But the increasing commercialization of small-scale fisheries, leading to profit-driven overfishing and the subsequent degradation of coastal fish stocks and natural marine environments, threatens the societal benefits of this ancient human-nature interaction (Lapointe et al. 2021) . Furthermore, it has been suggested that the profit-and yield-focused assumptions underpinning fisheries management have produced a myopic paradigm where the most important benefits from fisheries to humanity are overlooked (Allison et al. 2012) .",

Individual influences can arise from engaging in physical activity in nature, living adventures and overcoming challenge (Thompson Coon et al. 2011; Holland et al. 2020) . Fishing can provide a fulfilling social status, particularly in small-scale societies, associated with the opportunities to display strength and bravery, cooperate with others, and provide for one's family and community (Naranjo-Madrigal and van Putten 2019). Being a ''good fisher'' is associated with features that develop social cohesion, such as food sharing, frequent interaction and communication, and reciprocity at sea (Gustavsson et al. 2017; Holland et al. 2020) .

Fishers seem to have adapted to the risks of the fishing profession -one of the most dangerous occupations in the world (Kaplan and Kite-Powell 2000; H\u00e5vold 2010) , and have reported feeling a thrill that fulfills their fundamental need for adventure (Pollnac and Poggie 2008) . Furthermore, people in small-scale fishing communities have cited fishing among the top things that bring them most happiness (Mi\u00f1arro et al. 2021) . These results could be assumed to imply that catching more fish would yield more positive emotions (e.g., pride, happiness), and thus greater fishing effort would bring greater well-being to small-scale fishing communities.",

Subjective well-being (hereafter SWB) is recognized as an important component of the social wellbeing approach in fisheries (White 2008; Coulthard et al. 2011; Johnson 2018) . This approach envisions three dimensions of well-being including the material, relational and subjective dimensions, and has been used as a framework to investigate the locally relevant well-being benefits derived by fishing communities from coastal ecosystem services (Coulthard et al. 2014; Lau et al. 2019; Lapointe et al. 2021) . Recent research has focused on how specific stages of the small-scale fisheries value chain may provide well-being benefits to different stakeholders (Galappaththi et al. 2021) . While this has provided important findings on the varied nature of benefits and the mediating effects of specific factors, such as urbanization, discrimination or management approaches, a substantial data gap remains in mechanistically understanding how these benefits from the environment directly relate to the experience of human well-being (Carpenter et al. 2009; Lapointe et al. 2021; Fabinyi and Barclay 2022) . One little explored way to do it is by quantifying the effects of a specific activity on fishers' subjective well-being at the individual level (Soga and Gaston 2020) .",

PA and NA are independent and affected by different variables and should therefore be measured separately (Bradburn 1969; Diener 2009 ). Momentary affect can be measured through the Experience Sampling Method (ESM) . By prompting participants to answer questions about their current emotions and activities, this measure avoids recall bias and undergoes relatively little filtering against learned standards and expectations (Shiffman et al. 2008) . Because ESM yields repeated measurements of a person's activities, emotions, thoughts, and motivations over time, it can help reveal how much of the person's variation in happiness (or any other state) is related to what the person does, the company they keep, the time of day, etc. . ESM thus provides a direct quantification of how the activities a person does affect their well-being in real time.",

Diurnal cycles of affect and tiredness have also been reported by different studies (Stone et al. 1998; Kahneman et al. 2004) . Furthermore, negative affect has been shown to peak in the morning and then decrease throughout the day (Kahneman et al. 2004) . Some studies found marked contrasts between the expected enjoyment provided by specific activities, and the actual affect reported when doing the same activities, which highlights the difference between belief-based generic judgements and specific episodic reports (Kahneman et al. 2004; Shiffman et al. 2008; Diener et al. 2009 ).",

Flow is a state in which people are completely immersed in an activity in which their level of skill matches the challenge at hand, and where ''action follows upon action according to an internal logic which seems to need no conscious intervention on our part'' (Csikszentmihalyi 2014) . In flow, the activity itself is intrinsically rewarding, independently of external incentives, and leads to a sense of control and positive affect. For example, activities such as rock climbing, chess, or writing can lead to flow state, ''the optimal experience''. Although individuals differ in their propensity to achieve flow, activities must meet certain conditions for flow to occur: they must contain a clear set of goals, there must be a balance between the perceived challenges and perceived skills, and there must be clear and immediate feedback (Nakamura and Csikszentmihalyi 2014) . The reported self-actualization component of fishing, including ''adventure'' and ''challenge'' (Pollnac and Poggie 2008; Pollnac et al. 2012) , coupled with a clear goal and the high skill required from fishers, could indicate that fishing commonly leads to a flow-like state (Vitters\u00f8 1997) .",

We specifically ask: (i) how does the momentary affect of fishermen vary among their daily activities?, (ii) is fishing success associated with fishermen's affect during or directly after a fishing trip, and do the predominant emotions change with fishing success?, and (iii) can we detect the occurrence of flow during challenging and highly skilled fishing activities? Our results test the hypotheses that (i) activities associated with fishing would produce more positive affect than non-fishing activities, (ii) the frequency of positive affective states and emotions is proportional to the fish catch rate, and (iii) activities meeting the conditions for flow will be associated with more positive and less negative affective states. By using well-established psychological tools to test the association between fishing and affect, our work helps expand the understanding on the mechanisms by which fisheries support the well-being of fishing communities.",

The rural site in this study is Nijhum Dwip (Fig. 1) , a remote island created by a sand alluvium accumulation and first colonized by fishermen in the early 1950s. We surveyed fishermen from the small landing site of Namar Bazar (Fig. 1) . The majority of the population in Nijhum Dwip adhere to Islam, and its inhabitants face precarious living conditions (Siam et al. 2020 ). The island is highly vulnerable to climate change impacts and is frequently flooded by monsoonal storms and cyclones (Government of the People's Republic of Bangladesh 2017). The fishing is done exclusively by men around the island using push nets, bag nets, and gillnets. Most fishermen work for a patron, who provides a loan, boat and fishing gear, and the fish market is controlled by patrons. Fishermen in Nijhum Dwip went on fishing trips during 4.2 \u00b1 2.8 days per week, and mostly did one long (5-8 h) fishing trip per day. Occasionally, fishing crews go to distant fishing grounds requiring trips of up to a week. The Nijhum Dwip smallscale fishery is very risky; fishermen are often caught in monsoon storms with no assistance due to the lack of rescue fleet coverage in the area, according to the key informants, and there is no hospital on the island. Furthermore, institutionally sanctioned piracy was anonymously reported to this study's researchers on a number of occasions, leading to economic losses, personal harm, and losses of fishing equipment. Communities depend on money for certain goods and services, and at least one household member typically engages in some form of paid work, but all households are involved in subsistence activities.",

The list was developed before going to the field based on common pleasant and unpleasant emotions (Diener 2009 ) and refined during a pilot study with small-scale fishers in the Solomon Islands (Mi\u00f1arro et al. 2021) . During pilot testing, several respondents alluded to physical states when asked ''What are you feeling right now?'', so the option of answering with physical needs was added. However, these are not considered for the affect calculations. Participants were also asked to report what they were doing at the moment (i.e., their current activity, which was openended), why they were doing it (I have to/I want to/I have nothing else to do), how challenging the activity was (Very/ Quite/A little/Not at all) and how skilled they considered themselves at their current activity (Very/Quite/A little/Not at all). If they were fishing at the time of the call, they were asked to specify how long they had been fishing (openended), whether the fishing was going well, whether they had caught anything, and what was the nature of their current catch (species and weight) to evaluate the possible effect of these fishing variables on their affect. The study was given ethical approval by the UAB ethics committee under reference CEEAH 4119.",

For each call, positive affect, negative affect, and physical needs were coded as present or absent. If a fisherman reported one or more emotions/needs in an affective state, that affective state was recorded as present. Absent indicates no emotions/needs were selected for an affective state. Because of this approach, more than one affective state could be recorded per call. While some ESM studies have asked participants to rate the intensity of a given set of emotions (e.g., , it is also recommended that the contents on the questionnaire are targeted to the research goals and cultural setting (Diener 2009; Nakamura and Csikszentmihalyi 2014) .

This was done through peer coding, where two researchers classified all the responses independently and then compared and discussed their resulting categories until consensus was reached (Bishop and Dzidic 2014) . Given the study's focus on subjective experience, we tried to keep the fishermen's own classification of activities whenever possible. During this process, it became apparent that ''fishing'' comprised different phases throughout the fishing trip, which displayed marked differences in affect responses. Fishing preparation refers to when fishermen were getting ready to go fishing. Boat and net repair were treated as separate activities because while net repair is a fundamental part of the fishing operations in Bangladesh, boat repair is uncommon, taking place only when an accident occurs. A category called ''fishing-related unspecific'' was created for when participants answered only ''work''. Because participants were full-time fishers, and the answers tended to be specific when they were doing other non-fishing-related activities, we assumed work refers to fishing-related tasks without further specification. A Pearson correlation was used to test the correlation between PA and NA. Generalized linear mixed models (GLMM) with binomial family were applied to test if the occurrence of positive and negative affect (the dependent variables in the models) was different depending on respondents' current activity, time of the day, call number, site, the reason they gave for doing the activity, their perceived skill level, and the activity difficulty (as explanatory variable in individual models). We tested for and found no differences between the two sites in reported positive or negative affect, and thus the location variable was not considered in the final analysis. Participant ID and call number were considered as random effects to account for repeated measures on the same set of participants, and only participants with 6 or more calls were included in the models. Odds ratio tables were calculated for the activities, which had significantly different PA and NA for their categories, using ''resting'' as control activity. Resting (including sleeping) was chosen as control because it was presumed to be neutral in that, unlike in the other categories, participants do not receive much input from the environment that would influence their affect. Chi square tests were used to evaluate differences between the study sites in the explanatory variables.",

Second, we tested the relationship of positive and negative affect with fishing trip production in terms of absolute catch in kg and CPUE (catch per unit of effort) as fishing efficiency in kg per hour. To avoid potential confounding effects arising from variable market values, only fishing trips exclusively reporting hilsa in their catch were considered (N = 220), while fishing trips reporting other species in the catch were excluded (N = 75). Radar charts were produced to display the occurrence of disaggregated emotions for each of the three categories of subjective evaluation of the fishing trip to further explore the connection between the two variables. Because physical needs did not show enough variation across activities, it was not possible to run GLMMs with their occurrence as a response variable. Thus, they were excluded from the activity analyses, although we use them as descriptive additional information to characterize the occurrence of individual emotions.",

Our results show that positive affect was frequent during fishing preparation and decreased as the fishing trip progressed. Thus, the anticipation of going fishing, rather than fishing itself, was the only identifiable fishing-related activity that increased Fig. 4 Proportions of responses rating A the reason for doing activities, B how challenging participants perceived their current activities, and C participant's skillfulness self-assessment for activities that co-occurred with positive and negative affect. The asterisks indicate significance as follows: *p B 0.05, **p B 0.01, ***p B 0.001, ****p B 0.0001 the frequency of fishermen's PA. An especially negative affect-producing activity was selling the fish catch, which could be due to being exhausted after the fishing trip, stress about getting a low pay for their fish, or to low catches not being enough to fulfill their bond responsibilities (Mi\u00f1arro et al. 2016; Sambuo et al. 2020) . Besides, many fishermen complained that fishing takes place in very risky conditions and is dangerous due to monsoon storms, lack of safety equipment, and pirates, hazards that have also been reported elsewhere in Bangladesh (Kaplan and Kite-Powell 2000; Rahman and Schmidlin 2019) . Thus, perhaps the expected idea of fishing is not matched by Bangladeshi fishermen's reality, which echoes the discrepancy found in previous SWB studies between generic judgements of how enjoyable activities are, and actual episodic reports (Kahneman et al. 2004; Shiffman et al. 2008; Diener et al. 2009 ).",

The detailed emotions associated with fishers' assessments of the fishing trip indicate that ''worried'' was the main emotion commonly reported when the fishing was not going well, and it was frequently associated with accidents regarding the boat engine, or nets getting tangled or lost. Such incidents may prevent the fishing trip from getting enough catch to cover the associated costs, which typically include payments to their patron or boat owner (Mozumder et al. 2019; Sunny et al. 2021) , or may impair their ability to go fishing in subsequent days. But with the exception of such isolated accidents, we speculate that the stronger relationship between affect and fishermen's own assessment of a successful fishing trip may reflect the importance of non-catch aspects, such as safety and good weather conditions, the absence of boat or gear malfunction, or good rapport with their crew mates. It is also possible that fishermen's motivation for fishing influences their idea of ''success''. In any case, our results empirically corroborate previous findings that-although catching something is important-fishermen do not need big catches to enrich their experienced well-being during or after fishing (Coulthard et al. 2011; Pollnac et al. 2012; Islam and Chuenpagdee 2018) .",

Although caution must be made in directly associating the spatial array of our results with the more abstract model illustration, there is a clear trend toward more frequent PA in the lower right portion of Fig. 5A -positive affect dominates in situations that are not perceived as challenging. In contrast, negative affect is proportionally greater in more challenging situations, even at high self-assessed skill levels. It would appear that, for these fishermen, the most reliably positive situations occur when relaxing. This echoes findings from previous studies on momentary affect among western populations which found that leisure and relaxing activities topped the list of activities producing more frequent PA, as opposed to work, even for participants who found their job enjoyable and fulfilling (Kahneman et al. 2004; Shiffman et al. 2008) . Consistent with this, most responses of 'happy' occurred at lower levels of challenge (Fig. S4) . Furthermore, they consciously chose to engage in those activities, as shown (Csikszentmihalyi and Csikszentmihalyi 1992) for reference by the predominant reason given, I want to. Conversely, the more challenging activities were undertaken only for the reason I have to, and although positive affective states were reported during these activities, they tended to be mild ('well', or 'satisfied') and were less common than worry (Fig. S4) . Thus, although enjoyable flow states may have occurred for some fishermen during highly challenging fishing activities, they were not detectable by our method.",

The previous studies were based largely on job satisfaction interviews, a method that differs substantially from ESM, and may be more sensitive to the constructed identity of fishers and other related values, rather than the momentary lived experience of the fishing activity. Flow theory further specifies that besides the balance between challenge and skills, activities should fulfill other criteria allowing the person to have a sense of control of the situation by understanding what needs to be done and how they are performing (Csikszentmihalyi 1990 ). Based on informal reports given by multiple inhabitants of the communities, we speculate that in Nijhum Dwip the dangers and economic pressures associated with fishing are too high, leading to a lack of control that make them often worried during fishing. In Chittagong, the more passive nature of the fishing strategy (i.e., leaving gillnets in a designated spot and doing several trips per day to and from the same fishing ground to pick up the catch and exchange the nets), may reduce the thrill of fishing and consequently the positive affect induced by flow states, supporting the idea that the reality of fishing in this fishery is far from an idealized concept of adventure and camaraderie.",

As societies develop and coastal communities transition from traditional fishing to more market-oriented livelihoods, some of the positive features of traditional fishing (community cohesion, camaraderie, and cultural ties) may be threatened by the demands stemming from a new focus on productivity and profit. In addition, top-down management from external actors, and having less control over the fishery, have been shown to lead to a powerlessness which contributes to the decline of subjective well-being in commercial fisheries (Smith and Clay 2010) .",

First, because of the intensive nature of the data collection, participants in ESM studies are likely to be more motivated, conscientious, agreeable and tech-savy than the general population (Diener 2009 ). For instance, our sampling design attracted mostly relatively young-and therefore less experienced-fishermen, and less years of fishing experience have been associated with a lower self-actualization from fishing and higher willingness to change their occupation (Pollnac et al. 2012 ). Second, our study considers only one activity of the many dimensions of small-scale fisheries that can potentially affect well-being of fishing communities. Many other activities have a paramount role in the well-being of other actors in small-scale fisheries, such as those derived by women through their role in dried fish value chains (Galappaththi et al. 2021) , which deserve further consideration. Furthermore, the relational dimensions of wellbeing, including the fishers' identity, camaraderie, and community cohesion are very relevant in small-scale fisheries and may account for certain discrepancies with other studies using more holistic measures such as life or job satisfaction. For instance, while many SWB studies have found differences in satisfaction with life between urban and rural settings (Easterlin et al. 2011) , our sampling yielded no differences in affect between the sites. However, by examining the association between the fishing activity and affect in a focused manner, our work contributes to disentangle the mechanisms by which fisheries support the well-being of fishing communities.",

We also found that catching more fish was not a key factor in providing more frequent positive affect of fishers, although the self-assessed success of the fishing trip was associated with higher frequency of PA. Promising avenues for further research could explore other aspects of the quality of a fishing trip that may impact fishers' subjective well-being. Fishing may not be particularly enjoyable in the moment, but it may provide a feeling of satisfaction, pride, and camaraderie that could raise life satisfaction, as well as contribute to the overall well-being of fishing communities. We speculate that government programs aiming to improve well-being in small-scale fishing communities may, therefore, be able to best achieve their goals by focusing on sources of positive identity and community dynamics, rather than trying to maximize fishing activities. Our results are encouraging in showing that effective management of small-scale fisheries, involving reductions in fishing effort essential to halt overfishing, would not be at odds with fishers' subjective well-being, as long as other aspects about their livelihoods are improved.",
