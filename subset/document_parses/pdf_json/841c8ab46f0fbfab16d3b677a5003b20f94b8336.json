            "text": "Social interactions are stratified in multiple contexts and are subject to complex temporal dynamics. The systematic study of these two features of social systems has started only very recently, mainly thanks to the development of multiplex and time-varying networks. However, these two advancements have progressed almost in parallel with very little overlap. Thus, the interplay between multiplexity and the temporal nature of connectivity patterns is poorly understood. Here, we aim to tackle this limitation by introducing a time-varying model of multiplex networks. We are interested in characterizing how these two properties affect contagion processes. To this end, we study susceptible-infected-susceptible epidemic models unfolding at comparable timescale with respect to the evolution of the multiplex network. We study both analytically and numerically the epidemic threshold as a function of the multiplexity and the features of each layer. We found that higher values of multiplexity significantly reduce the epidemic threshold especially when the temporal activation patterns of nodes present on multiple layers are positively correlated. Furthermore, when the average connectivity across layers is very different, the contagion dynamics is driven by the features of the more densely connected layer. Here, the epidemic threshold is equivalent to that of a single layered graph and the impact of the disease, in the layer driving the contagion, is independent of the multiplexity. However, this is not the case in the other layers where the spreading dynamics is sharply influenced by it. The results presented provide another step towards the characterization of the properties of real networks and their effects on contagion phenomena.",

On a daily basis we interact at work, in the family, and across a wide range of online platforms or tools, e.g., Facebook, Twitter, emails, mobile phones, etc. In the language of modern network science, social networks can be conveniently modeled and described as multilayer networks [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] . This is not a new idea. Indeed, the intuition that social interactions are stratified in different layers dates back several decades [6] [7] [8] . However, the digitalization of our communications and the miniaturization of devices has just recently provided the data necessary to observe, at scale, and characterize the multilayer nature of social interactions.",

            "text": "As in the study of single layered networks, the research on multilayer graphs is divided in two interconnected areas. The first deals with the characterization of the structural properties of such entities [1, 4] . One of the central observations is that the complex topology describing each type of interaction (i.e., each layer) might be different. Indeed, the set and intensity of interactions in different contexts (e.g., work, family, etc.) or platforms (e.g., Facebook, Twitter, etc.) is not the same. Nevertheless, layers are coupled by individuals active across two or more of them. The presence of such coupling as well as its * n.perra@greenwich.ac.uk degree is often referred to as multiplexity. Another interesting feature of multilayer graphs is that the connectivity patterns in different layers might be topologically and temporally correlated [9] [10] [11] . The second area of research instead considers the function, such as sustaining diffusion or contagion processes, of multilayer networks [1, 12, 13] . A large fraction of this research aims at characterizing how the complex structural properties of multilayer graphs affect dynamical processes unfolding on their fabric. The first important observation is that disentangling connections in different layers gives rise to complex and highly nontrivial dynamics function of the interplay between interlayer and intralayer connections [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] . A complete summary of the main results in the literature is beyond the scope of the paper. We refer the interested reader to these recent resources for details [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] .",

This should not come as a surprise. Indeed, the systematic study of the temporal dynamics even in single layered graphs is very recent. In fact, the literature has been mostly focused on time-integrated properties of networks [27, 28] . As result, complex temporal dynamics acting at shorter timescales have been traditionally discarded. However, the recent technological advances in data storing and collection are providing unprecedented means to probe also the temporal dimension of real systems. The access to this feature is allowing to discover properties of social acts invisible in time aggregated data sets, and is helping characterize the microscopic mechanisms driving their dynamics at all timescales [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] . The advances in this arena are allowing to investigate the effects such temporal dynamics have on dynamical processes unfolding on time-varying networks. The study of the propagation of infectious diseases, ideas, rumors, or memes, etc., on temporal graphs shows a rich and nontrivial phenomenology radically different than what is observed on their static or annealed counterparts [29, .",

            "text": "In this context, we introduce a model of time-varying multiplex networks. We aim to characterize the effects of temporal connectivity patterns and multiplexity on contagion processes. We model the intralayer evolution of connections using the activity-driven framework [29] . In this model of time-varying networks, nodes are assigned with an activity describing their propensity to engage in social interactions per unit time [29] . Once active, a node selects a partner to interact. Several selection mechanisms have been proposed, capturing different features of real social networks [30, 31, [62] [63] [64] . The simplest, that will be used here, is memoryless and random [29] . In these settings, active nodes do not have a preference towards individuals previously connected. Despite such simplification, the mechanism allows capturing the heterogeneity of time-integrated connectivity patterns observed in real networks while guaranteeing mathematical tractability [29] . The multiplexity or coupling between layers is modulated by a probability p. If p = 1 all nodes are present in all layers. If p = 0, the multiplex is formed by M disconnected graphs. We consider p as a parameter and explore different regime of coupling between layers. Furthermore, each layer is characterized by an activity distribution. We consider different scenarios in which the activity of coupling nodes, which are present in different layers (regulated by p), is uncorrelated as well as others in which it is instead positively or negatively correlated. In these settings, we study the unfolding of susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) epidemic processes [65] [66] [67] . We derive analytically the epidemic threshold for two layers for any p and any distributions of activities. In the limit of p = 1 we find analytically the epidemic threshold for any number of layers. Interestingly, the threshold is a not trivial generalization of the correspondent quantity in the monoplex (single layer network). In the general case 0 < p < 1 we found that the threshold is a decreasing function of p. Positive correlations of coupling nodes push the threshold to smaller values with respect to the uncorrelated and negatively correlated cases. Furthermore, when the average connectivity of two layers is very different, the critical behavior of the system is driven by the more densely connected layer. In such a scenario the epidemic threshold is not affected by the multiplexity, its value is equivalent to the case of a monoplex, and the coupling affects only the layer featuring the smaller average connectivity.",

            "text": "We first introduce the multiplex model. For simplicity of discussion, we consider the case in which the system is characterized by M = 2 layers A and B. However, the same approach can be used to create a multiplex with any number of layers. Let us define N as the number of nodes in each layer. In general, we have three different categories of nodes: N A , N B , and N o . They describe, respectively, the number of nodes that are present only in layer A, B, or in both. The last category is defined by a parameter p: the coupling between layers (multiplexity). Thus, on average, we have N A = N B = (1 \u2212 p)N and N o = pN. As mentioned in the introduction, the temporal dynamics in each layer is defined by the activity-driven framework [29] . Thus, each noncoupling node is characterized by an activity extracted from a distribution f A (a) or f B (a) which captures its propensity to be engaged in a social interaction per unit time. Observations in real networks show that the activity typically follows a heavy-tailed distribution [29] [30] [31] 41, 62, 68] . Here, we assume that activities follow power laws, thus, f x (a) = c x a \u2212\u03b3 x with x = [A, B] and a 1 to avoid divergences. Coupling nodes instead are characterized by a joint activity distribution h(a A , a B ). As mentioned in the introduction, real multiplex networks are characterized by correlations across layers. In particular, the study of a wide range of real systems shows a complex and case dependent phenomenology in which the topological features (i.e., static connectivity patterns) of coupling nodes can be either positively or negatively correlated [9] . Furthermore, researchers found evidence of positive temporal correlations between the activation patterns across layers [10, 11] . To account for such observations and explore their effects on spreading processes, we consider three simple prototypical cases in which the activities of coupling nodes in the two layers are (i) uncorrelated, or (ii) positively and (iii) negatively correlated. To simplify the formulation and to avoid adding other parameters, in case of positive and negative correlations we adopt the following steps. We first extract N o activities from the two distributions f x (a). Then, we order them. In the case of positive correlation, a node that has the rth activity in A will be assigned to the correspondent activity in B. In other words, the first node will be assigned to the highest activity extracted from f A (a) and the highest value extracted from f B (a). The second will be assigned to the second highest activity extracted from both distributions, etc. In the case of negative correlations instead, a node that has the rth activity in A will be assigned the (pN \u2212 r + 1)th in B. In other words, the first node will be assigned to the highest activity in A and to the lowest activity in B. The second node will be assigned to the second highest activity in A and to the second lowest in B, etc.",

In this prototypical epidemic model each node can be in one of two compartments. Healthy nodes are susceptible to the disease and thus in the compartment S. Infectious nodes instead join the compartment I . The natural history of the disease is defined as follows. A susceptible, in contact with an infected node, might get sick and infectious with probability \u03bb. Each infected node spontaneously recovers with rate \u03bc, thus staying infectious for \u03bc \u22121 time steps, on average. One crucial feature of epidemic models is the threshold which determines the conditions above which a disease is able to affect a macroscopic fraction of the population [65] [66] [67] . In case of SIS models, below the threshold the disease dies out, reaching the so called disease-free equilibrium. Above threshold instead, the epidemic reaches an endemic stationary state. This can be captured running the simulations for longer times and thus estimating the fraction of infected nodes for t \u2192 \u221e: i \u221e . In general, in a multiplex network, such fraction might be different across layers. Thus, we can define i x \u221e .",

However, due to the stochastic nature of the process, the numerical estimation of the endemic state, especially in proximity of the threshold, is not easy. Thus, we adopt another method measuring the lifetime of the process L [72] .

The latter are regulated by first and second moments of the activity distribution and by the number of connections created by each active node (i.e., m). It is important to notice that Eq. (3) considers the case in which the timescale describing the evolution of the connectivity patterns and the epidemic process is comparable. The contagion process is unfolding on a time-varying network. In the case when links are integrated over time and the SIS process spreads on a static or annealed version of the graph, the epidemic threshold will be much smaller [29, 73, 74] . This is due to the concurrency of connections which favors the spreading. In fact, by aggregating the connections over time, the degree of each node increases thus facilitating the unfolding of the disease. In this limit of timescale separation between the dynamics of and on networks, the evolution of the connectivity patterns is considered either much slower (static case) or much faster (annealed case) with respect to the epidemic process. In the following, we will only consider the case of comparable timescales. This is the regime of time-varying networks which is extremely relevant for a variety of spreading processes ranging from sexual transmitted diseases and influenzalike illnesses to rumors and information propagation [28] .",

In Fig. 2 we show the first results considering a simple scenario in which m A = m B = 1 and the exponents for the distributions of activities are the same \u03b3 x = 2.1. The first observation is that in all three cases the analytical solutions (vertical dotted lines) agree with the results from simulations. The second observation is that in case of positive correlation between the activities of nodes in two layers, the threshold is significantly smaller than in the other two cases. This is not surprising as the nodes sustaining the spreading in both layers are the same. Thus, effectively, active nodes are capable to infect the double number of other nodes. As we mentioned above, many real multiplexes are characterized by different types of positive correlations. When thinking at real outbreaks, the effect of such feature on the spreading process suggests quite a worrying scenario. However, it is important to remember that real multiplexes are sparse, thus characterized by values of multiplexity which are far from the limit p = 1 [9] . As we will see below, this aspect plays a crucial role in the more realistic cases of 0 < p < 1. The thresholds of the uncorrelated and negatively correlated cases are very similar. In fact, due to the heterogeneous nature of the activity distributions, except for few nodes in the tails, the effective difference between the activities matched in reverse or random order is not large, for the majority of nodes. In Figs. 2(b) and 2(c) we show the behavior of the threshold as function of the activity exponents and the number of links created by active nodes in the two layers. For a given distribution of activity in a layer, increasing the exponent in the other (thus reducing the heterogeneity in the activity distribution) results in an increase of the threshold. This is due to the change of the first and second moments which decrease as a result of the reduced heterogeneity. In the settings considered here, if both exponents of activity distributions are larger than 2.6, the critical value of \u03bb becomes larger than 1, as shown in Fig. 2(b) . Thus, in such region of parameters, the disease will not be able to spread. For a given number of links created in a layer by each active node, increasing the links created in the other layer results in a quite rapid reduction of the threshold. This is due to the increase of the connectivity and thus the spreading potential of active nodes.",

Negative and null correlations of coupling nodes exhibit very similar thresholds. Instead, positive correlations push the critical value to smaller values. Furthermore, the smaller the multiplexity, the smaller the effect of positive correlations as the difference between the thresholds increases as function of p. This is a reassuring result. Indeed, as mentioned above, among the properties of real multiplex systems we find the presence of positive topological and temporal correlations as well as low values of multiplexity. The first feature favors the spreading of diseases. Luckily instead, the second property reduces the advantage of positive correlations pushing the threshold to higher values which are closer to the case of negative and null correlations. It is also important to notice how the threshold of a multiplex network (p > 0) is always smaller than the threshold of a monoplex (p = 0) with the same features. Indeed, the presence of coupling nodes effectively increases the spreading potential of the disease, thus reducing the threshold. However, the presence of few coupling nodes (p \u223c 0) does not significantly change the threshold; this result and the effect of multiplexity on the spreading power of diseases is in line with what was already discussed in the literature for static multiplexes [1, 22] .",

In other words, we investigate what happens when one layer has a much larger average connectivity than the other. This situation simulates individuals engaged in two different social contexts, one characterized by fewer interactions (e.g., close family interactions) and one instead by many more connections (e.g., work environment). In the figure, we consider a multiplex network in which the layer A is characterized by m A = 1. We then let m B vary from 1 to 10 and measure the impact of this variation on the epidemic threshold for different values of p. For simplicity, we considered the case of uncorrelated activities in the two layers, but the results qualitatively hold also for the other types of correlations. Few observations are in order. As expected, the case p = 0 is the upper bound of the epidemic threshold. However, the larger the asymmetry between the two layers, thus, the larger the average connectivity in the layer B, the smaller the effect of the multiplexity on the threshold. Indeed, while systems characterized by m B = 1 and higher multiplexity feature a significantly smaller threshold with respect to the monoplex, for m B 3 such differences become progressively negligible and the effects of multiplexity vanish. In this regime, the layer with the largest average connectivity drives the spreading of the disease. The connectivity of layer B effectively determines the dynamics of the contagion, and thus the critical behavior is not influenced by coupling nodes. Interestingly, this result generalizes to the case of time-varying systems which have been found in the case of static multiplexes. Indeed, Cozzo et al. [26] showed how the threshold of contact based processes is driven by the dominant layer which roughly corresponds to the layer featuring higher connectivity.",

The intralayer temporal dynamics follows the activity-driven framework which was developed for single layered networks (i.e., monoplexes). Thus, nodes are endowed with an activity that describes their propensity, per unit time, to initiate social interactions. We define the multiplexity as a free parameter p regulating the fraction of coupling nodes between layers. The activities of such nodes are considered, in general, to be different but potentially correlated. In these settings, we studied how multiplexity and temporal connectivity patterns affect dynamical processes unfolding on such systems. To this end, we considered a prototypical model of infectious diseases: the SIS model. We derived analytically the epidemic threshold of the process as function of p. In the limit p = 0, the system is constituted by disconnected networks that behave as monoplexes. In the opposite limit instead (i.e., p = 1) the epidemic threshold is a function of the first and second moments of the activity distributions as well as by their correlations across layers. We found that systems characterized by positive correlations are much more fragile to the spreading of the contagion process with respect to negative and null correlations. As several real multiplex systems feature positive topological and temporal correlations [9] [10] [11] , this result depicts a worrying scenario. Luckily, real multiplexes are also sparse, thus characterized by multiplexity values far from limit p = 1 [9] . The threshold also varies as a function of the number of layers M. Indeed, with perfect coupling each node is present and potentially active in each layer. Thus, the larger M, the smaller the epidemic threshold as the spreading potential of each node increases. In the general and more realistic case 0 < p < 1, we could not find a closed expression for the epidemic threshold. However, the critical conditions for the spreading can be calculated from the theory by investigating numerically the spectral properties of the Jacobian matrix describing the contagion dynamics. Also in this case, positive correlations of activities across layers help the spreading by lowering the epidemic threshold, while negative and null correlations result in very similar thresholds.",

In fact, we considered the simplest version of the activitydriven framework in which, at each time step, links are created randomly. Future work could explore the role of more realistic connectivity patterns in which nodes activate more likely a subset of (strong) ties and/or nodes are part of communities of tightly linked individuals. Furthermore, we assumed that the activation process is Poissonian and the activity of each node is not a function of time. Future work could explore more realistic dynamics considering bursty activation and aging processes. All these features of real time-varying networks have been studied at length in the literature of single layered networks but their interplay with multiplexity when dynamical processes are concerned is still unexplored. Thus, the results presented here are a step towards the understanding of the temporal properties of multiplex networks and their impact on contagion processes unfolding on their fabric.

Specifically, if p = 0, two layers are independent, thus regulated by two independent Jacobians, and we can get the following two eigenvalues: For 0 < p < 1, we could not find a general analytical expression for the eigenvalues of J . However, the critical transmission rate can be determined by finding the value of \u03bb leading the largest eigenvalue of J to zero. In other words, rather than solving explicitly the characteristic polynomial |J \u2212 I | = 0 and defining the condition for the spreading max > 0 as done above, we can determine the critical value of \u03bb as the value corresponding to the largest eigenvalue to be zero [76, 77] . \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7",
