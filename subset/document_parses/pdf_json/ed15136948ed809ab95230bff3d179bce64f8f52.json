            "text": "Objective Japanese encephalitis (JE) is a critical problem of public health worldwide; however, there is limited data about the clinical features and indicators of outcome in adults with severe Japanese encephalitis. Methods The clinical manifestations and laboratory study on brain neuroimaging of patients with severe JE were statistically analyzed retrospectively. All patients were followed up for 6 months after discharge. The patients were grouped into good outcome and poor outcome according to the results of the follow-up. Results This retrospective study consists of 9 adults with severe JE, including 5 cases with poor outcome, defined as the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) scores of greater than or equal to 4 points, and remained ventilator dependent. Typical clinical manifestations of JE include fever (100%), altered consciousness (100%), headache (66.7%), flaccid weakness (66.7%), and status epilepticus (44.4%). Serological examination revealed that a higher percentage of neutrophils and a lower percentage of lymphocytes at admission may be associated with a poor outcome. Abnormal neuroimaging of the thalamus (85.7%), hippocampal (71.4%), midbrain (28.6%), and basal ganglia (14.3%) was found. 42.9% of patients left severe irreversible disability, and the most prominent were mental symptoms (71.4%) and memory or understanding disorder (57.1%). Conclusion Our data suggest that respiratory failure is one of the important causes of early death. Serologic examination, coma, and status epilepticus may indicate a poor outcome for severe JE. Additionally, the hippocampus is the second most common lesion in the adults with severe JE. A large-scale clinical trial is required to further confirm these conclusions.",

Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) enters into the CNS via the blood-brain barrier (BBB), causing intense inflammation and neuron death [1] . The incidence of JE shows obvious seasonal features and is characterized by rapid onset and high mortality, which is clinically manifested by high fever, headache, disturbance of consciousness, epilepsy, and limb paralysis [2] . According to the World Health Organization, JEV is a main cause of severe encephalitis in Asia with 70,000 cases every year, epidemic in north and endemic in south [3] ; approximately 20-30% of patients die and 30~50% of the JE survivors will have severe neurological deficits or mental sequelae [4] . Annual incidence of JE cases varies by viral mutation, endemic regions, and age [5] ; with the rise of the vaccination rate of JE, the incidence Qi Su and Zhong-Xiang Xie contributed equally to this work.",

It is a critical problem of public health worldwide; however, most of the previous studies on JE have focused on children, and there is limited data on the clinical features and prognostic indicators of the eventual outcome of adult with severe Japanese encephalitis. It was reported that JEV takes mosquitoes as its media and pig can be the intermediate host for JEV [2] . Of note, Linyi is the largest city on the covered area and population in Shandong Province of China, with large rice cultivation areas, developed pig industry, the summer rainstorm, and humid warm climate, which provide the ideal conditions for the breeding of mosquitoes and the spread of JEV. The invasiveness of JEV is related to the difference of individual susceptibility, but in recent years, the incidence of adult Japanese encephalitis has gradually increased. On the one hand, with the overall incidence of JE decreasing, the chance of natural cryptogenic infection has decreased, leading to a gradual decline in vaccine-induced antibody levels; on the other hand, adults have a higher risk of infection because of the growing social mobility. Studies have shown that enhanced vaccination could provide 96.8% protection against JE [9] . Therefore, preventive vaccination with live attenuated vaccine and enhanced post-immunization testing can be better at preventing the occurrence of JE. The disease progresses through prodromal, encephalitic, and convalescent stages. The prodromal stage of JE is characterized by the sudden onset of fever, headache, nausea, and vomiting. The encephalitic stage then begins after 3 days, which typically manifests with dyskinesia (Parkinson's syndrome can be seen in 20 to 60% of patients), decerebrate rigidity, epilepsy, and neurological deficit [10] . Apart from typical presentations, rare cases which include acute transverse myelitis, cerebral venous thrombosis, and acute flaccid paralysis have also been reported [10] [11] [12] . In addition, neurological deficit such as hemiplegia is not an unusual phenomenon in the encephalitis stage, but as an initial manifestation, it is rare. A 52-year-old male in the current study with the initial presentation of left hemiplegia and fever developed lethargy after 2 days of hemiplegia. Anti-JEVspecific IgM had tested positive in the CSF and serum samples in 5 days, and the brain imaging revealed the high signal in the right basal ganglion, thalamus, and cerebral peduncle on DWI. It is possible that the lesions affected by the virus concentrated on the cortical spinal tracts, which occurred prior to the whole brain cells involved due to the over-activation of innate and adaptive immune cells.",

Our data showed that the hippocampus was involved in 50% of the 4 patients with epileptic persistence, which is in agreement with the literature. Epilepsy attack and brain tissue injury are cause and effect; brain tissue injury can lead to seizures, and seizures can cause neuronal damage, which repeated injury aggravates the damage to brain parenchyma. Studies have shown that seizures often occur in the early stages of JE, and prehospital seizures do not increase mortality, but patients with status epilepticus are more likely to die than patients with selflimited seizures [15] . Moreover, status epilepticus had been shown to be associated with poorer outcomes for JE, which often indicated the increased intracranial pressure [13] . Our data expand beyond the previous findings and show that status epilepticus may be associated with poorer outcomes of severe JE, and only one (11.1%) patient showed increased intracranial pressure far below the 50% reported [13] ; therefore, we consider that status epilepticus of severe JE may be associated with the damage to the extensive brain and the hippocampus.

During JEV infection, an increased neutrophil in the peripheral blood has been observed, which could degrade the virus by activating NADPH to release superoxide anion, it forms an early line of defense [2, 19] . Our data showed that patients with a higher percentage of neutrophils and a lower percentage of lymphocytes at admission tend to have a poorer outcome, which means that the balance between antiviral and inflammatory responses may be an important factor in outcome.",

The glucose and chloride levels were normal to low (22.2%), which were the same as those reported in literature [20] . Further analysis showed that there was no significant correlation between CSF parameters and poor outcome (p > 0.05), considering that the organ function damage caused by viremia was transient and reversible. Timely administration of the drug can effectively improve, and patients have different hospital admission time after onset, thus resulting in bias in the collection of blood samples and brain crest fluid; in addition, the sample size is small; the relationship between laboratory findings and the outcome of patients can be further studied by enlarging the sample size.",

One of our unanticipated findings was that the hippocampal is the second most common lesion (71.4%), where the lesions often involved the tail and body, and 2 patients (40%) are showing the amygdala and the uncinate involvement, while the secondary lesion of adults reported is often the midbrain [8] . Besides, temporal lobe involvement was seen in 2 cases (28.6%) in our study. Temporal lobe involvement can often lead to secondary epilepsy patients and language dysfunction, and we discovered that cognitive function in patients with temporal lobe involvement improved quite slowly, often leaving aphasias (50%). In addition, it often needs to be distinguished from herpes simplex encephalitis when the temporal lobe is involved, but the latter often invades the limbic system, especially the unilateral medial temporal lobe, which is also seen in the insula and cingulate gyrus, while involvement of both brain stem and basal ganglia is rare [22, 23] .",

In addition, we found out that the memory impairment of adults with severe JE (57.1%) is more serious than reported, which may be related to the increase of hippocampus injury mentioned above, which is critical to the longterm memory. There are extensive neural connections between hippocampus and the anterior thalamic nucleus [26] , which increased the memory damage. All the patients with memory impairment in this study showed damage to the thalamus and hippocampus that confirmed the opinions above. Interestingly, a patient in the current study has recovered from score 4 to score 1 after half a year of rehabilitation exercise (language, movement, psychology, etc.), which may be related to prompt rehabilitation, the economic condition of the family, and the understanding of the patient and his family.
