One area of current concern has been senior trainee travel for fellowship interviews. For example, applicants to pediatric surgery fellowship interview at upwards of 25 programs as part of a highly competitive match process. 1 With the emergence of COVID-19 and its aggressive spread, numerous institutions made a conscientious decision to defer in-person interviews in favor of virtual formats in early March, 2020. Organizational recommendations soon followed asking their participating fellowship programs to fully comply with those recommendations nationwide.",

Given the competitive nature of fellowship interviews, candidates may express concern that they are at a disadvantage in engaging in online meetings versus live, on-site interviews, and similarly may feel illprepared to perform optimally during online interviews. At our institution, we have offered online interviews for a variety of positions since 2017, and wanted to share our experience in how a trainee can best show their interpersonal skills during this process. Figure 1 provides anecdotal examples of the concerns both candidates and programs have expressed regarding virtual rather than in-person interviews. This guide provides recommendations for fellowship candidates who are rapidly adapting to new technology and styles associated with videoconference interviews so that they can best promote themselves for competitive positions. 3, 4 ",

These videoconferencing adaptations may outlive the global infectious threat by playing a more prominent role in upcoming application cycles. In the future, we may see streamlining of this process by use of a centralized virtual interview platform for all fellowship programs or increased use of virtual meetings as a screening tool for in-person interviews. As these changes unfold, an evaluation of how implementation of videoconferencing technology in surgical fellowship matches may affect the selection process should be undertaken from both a programmatic and candidate standpoint.",
