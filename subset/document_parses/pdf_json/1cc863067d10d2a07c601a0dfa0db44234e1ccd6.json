Methods In this single-centre observational case series, data were prospectively collected on 50 consecutive adults referred with eyelid lesions suitable to be seen by a nurse. A proforma was completed to gather salient information. A nurse specialist saw patients in face-to-face clinics and collected information using the proforma, devising a diagnosis and management plan. Photographs of the eyelid lesions were taken by a medical photographer. A subsequent remote review was completed by an oculoplastic consultant using the proforma information and photographs in the absence of the patient. The diagnosis and management plan constructed by the nurse specialist were compared with those reached by the consultant. Results Complete data were available for 44 consecutive cases. There was an overall 91% agreement (40 cases out of 44) between the diagnoses reached by the nurse specialist, and the remote reviewer; kappa coefficient 0.88 (95% CI 0.76 to 0.99). There was an overall 82% agreement (36 out of 44 cases) in the management plans devised by the nurse-led clinic and remote reviewer; kappa coefficient 0.74 (95% CI 0.58 to 0.90). The average time taken for a remote reviewer to reach a diagnosis and management plan was 1 min and 20 s. Conclusions This study evaluated the feasibility of assessing eyelid lesions using asynchronous telemedicine. There was overall a high rate of concordance in the diagnosis reached, and management devised between the clinic and remote review.",

Optimising pathways for these patients is vital to provide an efficient service and to reduce waiting times particularly when identification of malignant lesions is time sensitive. Multiple initiatives have been implemented to offer prompt diagnosis and treatment of eyelid lesions. A nurse-led eyelid lesions service has been shown to provide comparable diagnostic accuracy compared with a doctor-led service. 19 One-stop minor surgery lists have been set up in order to provide patients with same",

Data were prospectively collected on patients seen between November 2019 to January 2020 in nurse-led clinics as benign eyelid lesion cases are seen in nurse-led clinics at our institution. A bespoke structured proforma was designed to characterise the eyelid lesions and gather relevant information including history of skin lesions, ophthalmic, medical and drug history (online supplemental material). A nurse specialist saw patients in face-to-face clinics and collected information using the proforma and devised a diagnosis and management plan. Photographs of the eyelid lesions were taken at the end of the clinic appointment by a qualified medical photographer using a Canon EOS 7D camera with 5184\u00d73456 pixels resolution. A subsequent remote review of collected data and photographs was completed by an oculoplastic consultant in the absence of the patient. All cases were assessed by the same nurse specialist and the same consultant remote reviewer. Data, including patient demographics, number of days patients waited between the date of referral and the review, time taken for the consultant to review the cases remotely and referral sources as well as histopathological diagnoses where available, were collected. The diagnosis and management plan constructed by the nurse specialist in the face-to-face clinic and those reached by the consultant via remote review were compared by an independent assessor (oculoplastic fellow).",

In one case (case 5 of table 4; hereinafter all numerical case numbers refer to those listed in table 4), the nurse specialist diagnosed the lesion as a benign cyst and discharged the patient whereas the remote reviewer suspected a basal cell carcinoma due to the presence of central ulceration and listed for a biopsy. The lesion subsequently spontaneously resolved without intervention indicating that the lesion was of benign origin. In two cases, the lesions (a chalazion and a lipoma, cases 3 and 9, respectively) were not demonstrated well on photographs as these were subcutaneous, the undulation caused by the lesions was subtle, and there were no overlying skin changes. The lesions in question were not the focal point in the photographs probably due to the photographer being uncertain of the location of the lesions of concern. In case 3, the remote reviewer diagnosed an enlarged caruncle, where the patient was referred with a small chalazion in the lower lid near the punctum which did not display well in the photographs. The remote reviewer listed the patient for a biopsy of the caruncle whereas the nurse booked the patient for an incision and curettage of the chalazion. In case 9, the remote reviewer noted and diagnosed a papilloma which was adjacent to the lipoma and listed for a biopsy whereas the nurse practitioner brought the patient back for a review of the suspected lipoma. In case 4, a diagnosis of an epidermoid cyst was made by the nurse specialist whereas the remote reviewer diagnosed it as a chalazion and despite the discrepancy in the diagnosis, both the nurse practitioner and the remote reviewer discharged the patient.",

            "text": "The benefits of telemedicine including improved outcomes, cost and time-efficiency, and increasing access to healthcare are well documented in ophthalmology. [22] [23] [24] Telemedicine played a vital role in allowing continued provision of patient care while mitigating the risk of viral transmission during the recent COVID-19 pandemic and it has accelerated rapid integration of remote care into routine clinical practice. Oculoplastics is particularly well suited to telemedicine due to the highly visual nature of clinical assessment which can be evaluated without the need of a specialist equipment, however, the evidence base to support wider application of telemedicine is limited. 13 Our study assessed the ability to establish accurate diagnoses and management plans of eyelid lesions remotely using a data collection proforma and photographs. Diagnostic and management plan agreements were good between face-to-face consultations and remote review at 91% and 82%, respectively. Histopathological diagnoses, where available, were compared with clinical impressions made by face-to-face assessor and remote reviewer. Both face-to-face assessor and remote reviewer correctly diagnosed eyelid lesions in five out of six cases (83.3%) with both clinicians diagnosing the same lesion as a papilloma where the histopathology demonstrated a benign intradermal naevus. It is possible that the diagnostic discrepancy demonstrated in our study is not indicative of the disagreements between different modes of review but rather represents the diagnostic inaccuracies that would be observed in face-to-face clinic settings. Previous studies reported the diagnostic accuracy of 70%-96%. [25] [26] [27] [28] It has therefore been recommended that all excised eyelid tissues should be sent for histopathological analysis as clinical assessment alone will not warrant accurate diagnosis and malignant eyelid lesions may masquerade as clinically benign conditions. It is not uncommon to observe a diversity of clinical opinion among oculoplastic clinicians on the optimal management options for individual patients. In our study, although not statistically significant, the remote reviewer had a lower threshold to opt for excision biopsy whereas the face-to-face clinician was more likely to adopt a 'wait and see' approach. In one case, the remote reviewer suspected a basal cell carcinoma and chose to list the patient for a biopsy taking a more cautious approach.",

            "text": "Although the evaluation of eyelid lesions is akin to that of skin lesions, the inherent two-dimensional character of photographic evaluation poses particular challenges for eyelid lesions. The multilamellar anatomical construction of the eyelids means that the lesions can originate from or extend to deeper anatomical structures such as the tarsus or conjunctiva and may not be demonstrated well on photographs. Furthermore, eyelid lesions are likely to be smaller than those found on other parts of the body and may require more specialised lenses for adequate image resolution. A dynamic examination of eyelid lesions provides additional information as it is possible to ascertain, for example, if the lesion is tethered to the underlying structure, which is likely to narrow down the differential diagnoses.",

            "text": "Our study is one of the few that examined the utility of asynchronous telemedicine in oculoplastics. The proforma used in this study has been specifically designed to collect pertinent information to risk stratify the eyelid lesions by incorporating non-genetic risk factors such as age, history of previous skin malignancies and drug history. [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] Our study has several limitations. A small number of patients at a single centre with a limited range of diagnoses was enrolled and suspected malignant cases were excluded, thus limiting generalisability of the study. Six cases were excluded as clinical photographs were not captured. The face-to-face evaluation was performed by a nurse while the remote review was conducted by a doctor. The discrepancy between face-to-face consultations and remote review could be attributed to the inherent difference in training received. Having more than one face-toface and remote reviewers and assessing intraobserver and interobserver agreement would have allowed more Open access in-depth exploration and reduce bias. In some cases, the lesion in question was not the focal point of some clinical photographs and this made it difficult for the remote assessor to evaluate the case. The use of telemedicine in eyelid lesion assessment has a potential to reduce outpatient appointment and surgery waiting times, permit more accurate triaging of eyelid lesion cases, obviate the need for face-to-face appointments, and allow enhanced monitoring of eyelid lesions. This approach can be adopted for (1) referral refinement which has been shown to successfully reduce unnecessary or inappropriate referrals thus reducing waiting times;",
