The 3C-like protease (3CL pro ) of SARS-CoV-2 is a preferred target for broad spectrum anti-coronavirus drug discovery. We studied the anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity of S. baicalensis and its ingredients. We found that the ethanol extract of S. baicalensis and its major component, baicalein, inhibit SARS-CoV-2 3CL pro activity in vitro with IC 50 's of 8.52 mg/ml and 0.39 mM, respectively. Both of them inhibit the replication of SARS-CoV-2 in Vero cells with EC 50 's of 0.74 mg/ml and 2.9 mM, respectively. While baicalein is mainly active at the viral post-entry stage, the ethanol extract also inhibits viral entry. We further identified four baicalein analogues from other herbs that inhibit SARS-CoV-2 3CL pro activity at mM concentration. All the active compounds and the S. baicalensis extract also inhibit the SARS-CoV 3CL pro , demonstrating their potential as broad-spectrum anti-coronavirus drugs.",

The genomic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 is highly similar to that of SARS-CoV with about 79.6% sequence identity 5 and remains stable up to now 6 . However, the sequence identities vary significantly for different viral proteins 5 . For instance, the spike proteins (S-protein) in CoVs are diverse in sequences and even in the host receptors that bind due to the rapid mutations and recombination 7 . Although it has been confirmed that both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 use ACE2 as receptor and occupy the same binding site, their binding affinities to ACE2 vary due to subtle interface sequence variations 8 . On the contrary, the 3C-like proteases (3CL pro ) in CoVs are highly conserved. The 3CL pro in SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 share a sequence identity of 96.1%, making it an ideal target for broad spectrum anti-CoV therapy. Although many inhibitors have been reported for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV 3CL pro 9-12 , unfortunately none of them has entered clinical trial.",

In addition, a multicentre, retrospective analysis demonstrated that S. baicalensis exhibits more potent antiviral effects and higher clinical efficacy than ribavirin for the treatment of hand, foot, and mouth disease 26 .

We found that the ethanol extract of S. baicalensis inhibits SARS-CoV-2 3CL pro activity and the most active ingredient baicalein exhibits an IC 50 of 0.39 mM. Both the ethanol extract of S. baicalensis and baicalein effectively inhibit the replication of SARS-CoV-2 in cell assay. The anti-SARS-CoV-2 3CL pro activity and antiviral activity were also reported by a recent publication 30 . We further studied the structure and activity relationship of baicalein analogues and identified four new active compounds from other herbs that inhibit SARS-CoV-2 3CL pro activity at mM concentration.",

As the expression of SARS-CoV-2 3CL pro is toxic to mammalian cells 36 , we used the mixture of HEK293T cell lysate and purified SARS-CoV-2 3CL pro for the test. Both baicalein and the crude extract showed inhibition activity under this condition ( Figure S2 ). We performed molecular docking to understand the inhibitory activity of S. baicalensis ingredients. The docking scores are listed in Table S1 . In the docking model, baicalein binds well in the substrate binding site of SARS-CoV-2 3CL pro with its 6-OH and 7-OH forming hydrogen bond interactions with the carbonyl group of L141 and the backbone amide group of G143, respectively ( Figure 3(A) ). In addition, the carbonyl group of baicalein is hydrogen bonded with the backbone amide group of E166. The catalytic residues H41 and C145 are well covered by baicalein, accounting for its inhibitory effect. This computational model is in consistent with the recently reported crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 3CL pro complexed with bacailein 30 . As the 7-OH in baicalin is in close contact with the protein, there may not be enough space for glycosyl modification, explaining the low activity of baicalin. As for wogonin, the absence of 6-OH together with its additional 8-methoxyl group alters the binding orientation and weakens the binding strength (Figure 3(B) ). Hydrogen bond is observed between its 5-OH and the backbone carbonyl group of L141, while the interaction with E166 by its 8-methoxy group is weaker than that formed by the carbonyl group in baicalein.",

            "text": "Based on the docking analysis, we searched for baicalein analogues from available flavonoid suppliers and selected eight flavonoids and two glycosides for experimental testing ( Table 2 ). The docking scores are given in Table S1 . Four flavonoid compounds were found to be potent SARS-CoV-2 3CL pro inhibitors. Among them, scutellarein is mainly distributed in genus Scutellaria and Erigerontis herba (Dengzhanxixin or Dengzhanhua in Chinese) in its glucuronide form, scutellarin. Scutellarin has long been used in cardiovascular disease treatment for its ability to improve cerebral blood supply 37 . As shown in Figure 4 , scutellarein inhibits SARS-CoV-2 3CL pro with an IC 50 value of 5.8 mM, while scutellarin showed mild inhibitory activity at 50 mM concentration. The other three flavonoid compounds, dihydromyricetin, quercetagetin, and myricetin derived from Ampelopsis japonica (Bailian in Chinese), Eriocaulon buergerianum (Gujingcao in Chinese), and Polygoni avicularis (Bianxu in Chinese), respectively, inhibit SARS-CoV-2 3CL pro with IC 50 values of 1.20, 1.24, and 2.86 mM. Interestingly, scutellarein and myricetin were reported to inhibit the SARS-CoV, indicating their potential as multi-target anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents 38 . We further showed that S. baicalensis extract, baicalein, and the four active baicalein analogue compounds also inhibit the activity of SARS-CoV 3CL pro in vitro ( Figure S3 ), demonstrating their potential as broad spectrum anti-CoV agents. For future development and in vivo studies, the bioavailability of these compounds needs to be considered. Although the bioavailability of baicalein is low in oral administration, its concentration can be increased at lung tissue through intratracheal administration 30 . We suggest that these compounds can be further optimised or used to search for other TCM herbs containing these compounds or substructures to develop effective treatments for COVID-19 and other coronavirus infectious diseases.",
