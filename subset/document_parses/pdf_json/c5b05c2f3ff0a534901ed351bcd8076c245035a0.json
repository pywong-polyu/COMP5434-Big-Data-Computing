In particular, Sandberg has pointed out how since the early 1990s, privatization shifted a media landscape that until then had operated on regional and national levels and had been at least partially protected by the state, toward one of private entities strongly interested in transnational expansion (Mc Chesney, in Sandberg 2018, p. 6) . Both in the commercial and the art film sectors, market driven logics have become the guiding principles of film production, distribution, and exhibition.",

The cuts to state funding implemented by the 1994 Cinema Law significantly reduced filmic production, prompting many filmmakers to insert themselves into the network of international film festival financing institutions (Barrow 2018, p. 29; Bedoya 2015, p. 54) . Consequently, the technical standards and stylistic and thematic parameters of this global film market were imposed as necessary paths for success, especially for art films (Bedoya 2015, pp. 53, 61) . In addition, the expansion of Peruvian consumer culture facilitated the emergence of privately owned and relatively successful commercial film companies with global models of style and genre for production, and standardized industrial systems for distribution and exhibition.",

Lima-based and regional independent commercial, art and experimental films blossomed, changing aesthetic parameters and allowing a diverse range of narrative structures and styles (Bedoya 2015, pp. 50, 73) . Technological availability also triggered the growth of alternative circuits of exhibition both in Lima and throughout the country, breaking up-albeit on a limited scale-the monopoly of mainstream multiplex-model movie theaters.

This festival contested the state funding competitions' aesthetic and technical parameters and their \"technocratic bureaucratization and homogenization of the creative process\" (Radio Lima Gris 2015a) by presenting those Peruvian experimental films which did not adjust to such standards (Quispe Alarc\u00f3n 2019) and which, therefore, had been rendered invisible. With avant-garde-inspired antagonism, the festival presented its films as enacting the concept of a \"new Peruvian cinema\" 4 which was innovative, transgressive, marginal, and radically free of all those constraints that usually accompany the economic support of sources other than the artists themselves.",

In addition to documenting and institutionalizing a distinct corpus of Peruvian cinema far beyond that which is governed by commercial aspirations or ambitions of artistic transnational success, Lima Independiente was the first local festival at the time to position itself in open contrast to the type of national film culture promoted by the Festival de Cine de Lima, Peru's leading cinematic event. 5 By 2011, this institution had already gathered significant regional and international prestige and had become a powerful local and regional arbiter and shaper of cinematic taste (Barrow 2016, pp. 133-134) . Denouncing what it called the Festival de Cine de Lima's auteurist and high culture principles, as well as its neoliberal public-private model of nation-building through cultural capitalism, Lima Independiente emerged as a dissenting space for developing an alternative Peruvian film culture, a political act aimed at breaking the homogeneity of the field's status quo. 6 This opening embraced radical artistic innovation and attempted to forge meaningful transnational dialogue with world cinema in quite a different manner from what was seen as the \"decadent\" internationalist profile of the Festival de Cine de Lima which, according to Quispe Alarc\u00f3n (2019), was excessively centered on red carpets, prominent guests and vast press coverage. With a similar spirit to that of Humberto Sol\u00e1s's Festival de Cine Pobre de Gibara, launched in opposition to Cuba's main cinematic event (the Festival de Cine de La Habana), 7 Lima Independiente sought to create an alternative circuit for low-budget cinema which rejected the need for expensive equipment and was not afraid of alienating audiences with its experimentation. 8 As such, Lima Independiente might be read, with Ranci\u00e8re (1999) , as the disruptive political appearance of that type of \"surplus\" cinematic production that was being left unaccounted for in the field of Peruvian cinema.",

Acknowledging his deep \"ideological debt\" to Jean Luc Godard, Jos\u00e9 Luis Guer\u00edn and Pedro Costa, his work and activism have also been significantly shaped by movements like Dogme 95, independent subgenres like American Mumblecore, and by the radical Latin American cult filmmaking icon Ra\u00fal Perrone from Argentina (Quispe Alarc\u00f3n 2019). In addition, as I will develop further in the last section of this chapter, his understanding of cinema's political role and the fusion of art and life that he proposes, echoes the militant ethos of the New Latin American Cinema (NLAC) movement of the 1960s and early 70s. In what follows, I will present how, while inscribing himself within an already established global tradition of artistic experimentation, 10 Quispe Alarc\u00f3n has creatively appropriated it by presenting a sincere take on his main subject: young second-generation Lime\u00f1os of the early twenty-first century. Beyond the many influences that can be traced through his films, his main objective has been, first: to give cinematic life to a specific cohort that he believes has been ignored or superficially represented, and second: to provide a cinematic space where these young people might see themselves in the characters, the situations, and the natural, unscripted dialogues. In this sense, his films aim to transcend their dimensions as works of art, and rather wish to create a bond with specific spectators by exploring some aspects of their identities and relationships, and by critically engaging with their immediate socio-historical context. This is the result of an understanding of cinema not only as a means of representation, but as a larger project of political proportions meant to disrupt and enhance what Ranci\u00e8re conceptualized as the governing \"regime of the perceptible\" (1999, p. 102).",

Consequently, he has rejected all those industrial corporate and marketing resources (high production values, sophisticated postproduction editing, elaborate and rigid scripts, and professional acting) that in his view, transform film into mere spectacle (Zunin 2015) . This rejection is a core principle of much low-budget digital film production, a global phenomenon that has flourished in the last few decades thanks to the ever-increasing accessibility of technology. Within experimental filmmaking, low-budget digital film production has not only challenged established cinematic language and to a certain extent weakened the role of the most invasive capitalist elements of filmmaking; most importantly, it has democratized film production away from the colonizing effects of funding needs and production agents. Sometimes paying the price of low visibility and reduced audiences-something increasingly offset by internet streaming, as in Quispe Alarc\u00f3n's case-low-budget production has distanced filmmaking from one of its most persistent curses: its dependency on significant sums of money. 11 Particularly in a country like Peru, where filmmaking used to be the privilege of the urban cosmopolitan elite, low-budget film production-apart from having been key in the development of regional commercial film-has enabled the flourishing of a wide variety of experimental projects by filmmakers from modest backgrounds, limited economic and professional means, and self-taught or alternative film instruction like Quispe Alarc\u00f3n. In sum, in spite of persistent limitations, the profession of the filmmaker has been substantially democratized in the country.",

            "text": "Quispe Alarc\u00f3n's films are exercises of aesthetic and technical austerity (resonant of neorealism) which aim to recover and convey the authenticity of spaces, dialogues, and human interactions. As he himself has remarked, the freedom brought by making film with whatever is at hand has an important effect on the filmmaker's ability \"to understand reality grounded in the perspective of those who live it, rather than from the gaze of the distant artist-observer\" (Quispe Alarc\u00f3n 2019). For example, in all six of his films, the absence of artificial lighting means that sometimes people and objects are hard to distinguish. Occasionally, unedited direct sound-like loud street traffic or the clicking of cups and saucers in a cafe, as in 1 (2008)-makes the characters' conversations unintelligible. As a rejection of the intrinsic artificial nature of filmmaking, these formal choices are unavoidably romantic attempts to represent life in its most genuine form. Likewise, the use of one single shot to film the sixty-eight minute long 3 (2010) attempts to install the Deleuzian \"time-image\" of a city park into the frame, encouraging \"a new way of seeing, one that is open to the capturing of mistakes, errors, and randomness of the reality being filmed\" (Rombes 2009, p. 40) . In sync with the contemplative principle of slow cinema, whose \"direct presentations of time\" (Deleuze, quoted in De Luca and Barradas Jorge 2016, p. 8) offer the spectator a different temporal relationship to perception, Quispe Alarc\u00f3n believes that the long take reduces the spectators' exposure to constant stimuli, becoming \"an invitation to think about the image\" (2019). 12 Quispe Alarc\u00f3n has also been inspired by the so-called \"digital socialism\" of the American Mumblecore movement of the early 2000s (Naish 2013, pp. 43-47) . Mumblecore had naturalism as its fundamental production ethos both in acting and in dialogue, and thus used no scripts or professional actors. Instead, improvisation was encouraged and dialogue was prioritized over plot, actors were willing friends, and locations were regular people's apartments or non-iconic ordinary urban places. Rejecting \"the cult of the director or producer,\" Mumblecore incorporated a practice of collective creativity based on the horizontal collaboration of all those involved in making a movie (2013, pp. 43, 57) . 13 Following this spirit, the actors and crew of Quispe Alarc\u00f3n's films are also friends who have varying levels of professional training and who are not paid for their work. They are all recognized in final credits as part of a creative community: actors are not listed as cast but as filmmakers themselves (realizadores ); in 3, for example, the cameraman (Jim Marcelo Santiago) appears as co-director; and in 4 no director is acknowledged (Marcelo Santiago and Quispe Alarc\u00f3n simply appear as producers). Still, in all six films, this type of collaborative production practice is nonetheless quite grounded on autorial structures of individual style, marking its difference with other forms of Peruvian collective filmmaking. 14",

His films' portrayal of this specific social, cultural, and economic group focuses on how their interpersonal dynamics, psychological states, and romantic relationships, result in a particular way of inhabiting the city. By exploring the development of couples' relationships under the specific frame of Lime\u00f1o landscapes, Quispe Alarc\u00f3n conceives and constructs urban experience as a way of inquiring into these young people's lives in twenty-first-century neoliberal Peru. As he has stated, \"all the suffering experienced in the relationship reflects, to a certain extent, the suffering experienced by the country [\u2026] I believe couples mirror cities\" (Rojas 2014).",

            "text": "The overarching critique of neoliberal rationality that connects Quispe Alarc\u00f3n's cultural agency, his aesthetics and his anti-industrial decisions, is also key to his thematic choices: his films denounce the effects of traditional capitalist and neoliberal technologies of power on human social behavior, showing how they function through modulating subjectivities \"from below\" as Gago (2017, p. 2) has argued. 16 For example, several of his characters display the \"intrinsic\" entrepreneurial spirit of what C\u00e1nepa Koch (2013, p. 9) , in line with current studies of technologies of citizenship and nation branding, refers to as \"participatory subjects\" who embody the way that neoliberalism's performative order has redefined the concept of citizenship. 17 Conceiving themselves as human capital, these Peruvians have internalized a normative force by which they hold themselves responsible for the efficient management of their lives. 18 By representing them in his films, Quispe Alarc\u00f3n condemns on screen, at the end of 6, the way neoliberal power, \"having controlled a territory and its market, aspires to conquer minds, hearts and souls.\" A few minutes into 3, for example, we find a young woman impatient with a romantic relationship that she considers a \"waste\" of her time because it obstructs her professional advancement. As she explains, the money that she could make in the future if she concentrated on her studies rather than on her romantic bond would allow her to \"to advance\" and so meet her mother's demand to be the one to move the whole family further up economically. In her view, this potential achievement should not be risked for what she refers to as \"a fleeting relationship.\" This quantification of affective life, which establishes goals, designs strategies and manages resources following market metrics (C\u00e1nepa Koch 2013, p. 9) points to the dehumanizing and isolating effects of these young people's embrace of the \"entrepreneurial epic\" (C\u00e1nepa Koch and Lossio Ch\u00e1vez 2019, p. 18) and their subsequent inability to give themselves to others without thinking of costs and benefits. In this young woman's particular case, what her statements reveal is the juxtaposition of two regimes of subjugation: on one side, the Christian logic of debt that results from the sacrifice made by parents for the benefit of their children, and on the other, the traditional capitalist and neoliberal technologies of power which demand the individual's performance as a fully productive subject. As a further expansion and transformation of capitalist biopolitics, what Han (2017) has conceptualized as \"psychopolitics\" operates by taking control of the individuals' psyche, engineering and steering the subject's wishes and needs from within. As Han has stated, following Deleuze, if the biopolitical regime imposed repressive control over the body, the neoliberal regime, as a step further, is a psychopolitical one that operates \"like a soul\" exploiting the individual's freedom (2017, p. 15, 18) . In this context, and via characters like the one presented above, Quispe Alarc\u00f3n depicts the demand that these enslaved subjects exert on themselves: the mandate for compulsive achievement is here combined with the obligation to respond appropriately to the opportunities given by migrant parents. As a critique of this logic of subjugation, Quispe Alarc\u00f3n wants to show the truth that he believes lies below these subjects' performative discourse: loneliness and human disconnection. In his films, many of these young Lime\u00f1os appear isolated, drifting through an urban space that is filmically constructed as an extension of their own uncertainties, unrest, and emotional wanderings (Bedoya 2015, pp. 193-194) . Ideologically, this representation connects with the long tradition of Marxist critique that understands isolation and alienation as the fundamental traits of social life under capitalism. In that vein, fragmentation-both as a fundamental social condition of life under late capitalism, and as the essence of Quispe Alarc\u00f3n's own realist aesthetic-is the overarching principle of his work.",

At the aesthetic level, fragmentation is also the guiding structure in 2, where social gatherings are filmed from extremely low-angle point of view shots that fragment bodies and objects, and where the narrative flow is repeatedly interrupted by cuts to black screens.

            "text": "Fragmentation as a structuring principle also affects the compositional unity of some of the films. The main body of 5 (2014), for example, is framed by a prologue and an epilogue that thematically have no apparent connection with the rest of the film. They appear as leftovers of an earlier recording over which new material has been filmed: blue screens that look like \"tracking\" jump cuts make up the transitions between the main body of the film and these frames. 19 This technique, nowadays widely used in experimental film, intends to reproduce the feeling of a home video filmed on a previously used cassette tape. By using it, Quispe Alarc\u00f3n intends to show how chance can spontaneously \"edit\" a film, creating an unexpected \"story\" (Rojas 2014). In this sense, fragmentation becomes an alternative way of composing a narrative. This approach culminates in 6, where an even more radical dismissal of compositional unity occurs, and different filmic languages are combined. 6 is the residue of several failed film projects: they all appear as fragments or ruins of absent movies that never came to be. After an initial shot that apparently has no connection to what follows-a scene where Quispe Alarc\u00f3n gives instructions to the cameraman-the first thirty-two minutes of the film tell the story of a couple made up of two young women who aspire, but are ultimately unable, to make a film. Then, for the next seventy minutes, 6 becomes a manifesto-type film essay where, in pseudo-documentary style and amidst footage of failed filming and shots of the storyboard, Lime\u00f1o landscapes, and urban events, Quispe Alarc\u00f3n tells the frustrating story of how his original idea of a film about the difficulties of making independent cinema in Peru became just that due to the precarity of resources and the never-ending obstacles. When volunteer actors left the project for other commitments or when locations became unavailable, the \"plots\" and structure of 6 had to be changed repeatedly. In sum, the film's fragmentation at various levels became not so much the result of an artistic decision, but a reality check of the all-embracing precarity that this type of independent filmmaking in Peru has to face. 20",

Addressing issues of neocolonialism, poverty and underdevelopment, NLAC filmmakers understood material constraints as a catalyst for artistic experimentation and conceived cinematic praxis as a tool for social and political change (Buruc\u00faa and Sitnisky 2018, p. 2) . Quispe Alarc\u00f3n's convictions echo NLAC's idealism, its decolonizing \"mission,\" its desire to transform habits of spectatorship, and its call for politically committed artists and intellectuals. Nevertheless, both his films' aesthetics and his ideas about cinema's role are quite distant from this group's Marxist-Leninist orthodoxy and from its continental collective project of political uprising. From an Anarchist rather than a Marxist perspective, Quispe Alarc\u00f3n takes from Grupo Liberaci\u00f3n's \"Third Cinema\" (1969), Julio Garc\u00eda Espinosa's \"Imperfect Cinema\" (1969) , and Glauber Rocha's \"Aesthetics of Hunger\" (1965) their belief in a much needed \"decolonization of culture\" (Getino and Solanas 1969a, b, p. 37 ) that liberates the spectator from the banality of commercial cinema and from auteur film's structures of dependency and elitist limitations. His understanding of liberation, though, is far from the revolutionary radicalism and the ardent belief in the historical protagonism of the \"masses\" professed by NLAC filmmakers. For example, in contrast to the passionate and direct call to political activism that the highly successful and recently released La revoluci\u00f3n y la tierra (2019) makes on Peruvian spectators-in a tone much closer to that of NLAC documentaries-for Quispe Alarc\u00f3n, cinema's role is to restore individual autonomy in its most essential sense, freeing individuals from neoliberal mandates through cinematic experiences that break up their passivity as spectators, challenge their imagination, and allow them to critically see themselves on screen. In his view, this process has the potential to re-humanize audiences and trigger a socially and politically engaged citizenship.",

However, he believes this should not be achieved by developing a \"cinema of the masses\", 22 but by calling on the state's obligation to facilitate culture as a public service. He demands the state to discard its current operating principle of economic sustainability for matters of cultural promotion, and instead focus on developing art's potential to strengthen the country's social fabric (Quispe Alarc\u00f3n 2019). To put this in practice at the level of film production, Quispe Alarc\u00f3n believes it is essential to democratize who can become a filmmaker in Peru and how filmmaking is done. He argues for the state's creation and funding of public and economically accessible film schools that would stand as alternatives to the purely technical and market-oriented private film schools and university communications departments that have flourished mostly in Lima in the last two decades. With Humanities-focused curricula, these schools would not only allow directors and film scholars from diverse geographical, cultural, and economic backgrounds to develop; they would also promote a different understanding and practice of cinema as an art form inherently linked to exploring the circumstances, the needs, and the problems of Peruvians (Radio Lima Gris 2018). Realizing that this is quite an ambitious goal considering the limited political will of the Peruvian state to support cinema, Quispe Alarc\u00f3n calls on Peruvians' resourcefulness by stating that nowadays, anyone with a true passion for cinema and an authentic interest to learn from its history can become a filmmaker without the need for expensive education or equipment. As happened in his case, the vast resources currently available through the internet provide a valuable tool to surpass economic and educational limitations (2019).",

            "text": "At the level of exhibition, if creating national audiences for a cinema of artistic value and social engagement is nowadays quite a challenge in Peru as it is elsewhere, for Quispe Alarc\u00f3n this can be achieved by transforming the very nature of what is understood as the experience of watching a film. In what appears unusual coming from a self-identified Anarchist, he calls once again on the state to play a stronger role working together with artists to create programs intended to re-humanize and re-politicize Peruvian audiences. In his view, this could be done by significantly expanding and financing community-building film-viewing public screenings and discussions that prioritize direct contact and dialogue between filmmakers and audiences (Radio Lima Gris 2015b). 23 He contends that the type of conversations that naturally develop in these events reinforce what he believes is cinema's crucial role: to trigger people's interest in exploring their own subjectivity and that of others, to awaken their political conscience, and to bring people together in a way that encourages a communal sense of belonging (Radio Lima Gris 2018). For Quispe Alarc\u00f3n, it is not a matter of understanding cinema as an object of cult or erudite value that needs to be paternalistically \"decoded\" for an uneducated public. It is rather about opening up opportunities for regular people to be exposed to an audiovisual experience that stimulates their aesthetic sensibility, fosters their critical thinking, and connects with them through real-life situations and characters. As an alternative to the neoliberal model of experiencing cinema in isolation as a commodity, Quispe Alarc\u00f3n believes that these cinematic events are opportunities for Peruvians to connect, relate, and empathize with each other through discussions about film.",

            "text": "From a critical standpoint, several considerations of Quispe Alarc\u00f3n's inspiring ideals and artistic practices need to be taken into account. The first is to acknowledge the significant difficulties of reconciling some of the most radical artistically experimental elements of his aesthetics with his desire to connect with average people in a non-erudite form. While his films do capture and portray real-life circumstances and genuine, non-artificial characters capable of interpellating and affectively connecting with a specifically differentiated local-and potentially international-audience (urban middle-class youth), their abstraction, fragmented composition, elliptical narratives and slow temporal unfolding can be difficult for many to undergo. In this sense, at a practical level, the way his films aesthetically embody his theoretical pronouncements can certainly interfere with his convictions about the need to bridge the gap with his spectator. Inevitably, films like Quispe Alarc\u00f3n's are mostly seen by small audiences accustomed to cinematic experimentalism. In this sense, his belief in art or independent film's potential for social impact cannot avoid what Ranci\u00e8re described as \"the aesthetic cut that separates outcomes from intentions\" (2009, p. 82) .",

            "text": "In addition, history has shown us that much of the fresh radicalism of provocateur artists like those that inspire Quispe Alarc\u00f3n's work has faded, having been co-opted by mainstream consumer-oriented filmmaking and even by mainstream media/video platforms. By contrast, until now Quispe Alarc\u00f3n has remained fervently coherent and committed to his principles of a fiercely autonomous low-budget practice, but for this he has paid a price. As shown in 6, his ability to continue making film is limited and exhausting. Moreover, his refusal to seek state or private funding, to accept the conditions of mainstream venues to screen his films, and to regularly participate in film festivals, has significantly reduced the visibility of his work and his capacity to reach a wider audience. In this respect, he has stated that he is not interested in promoting a successful career, but rather in offering his films as opportunities for artistic, personal, and communal exploration. He believes that, whoever has an authentic desire to explore cinema on these terms can find his films in alternative screening circuits or online (Quispe Alarc\u00f3n 2019). However, what solitary online viewing does not fully allow is precisely that shared space for human encounter and collective discussion that he himself advocates is essential for advancing a sense of community and citizenship. Furthermore, any consideration of the political potential of cinema needs to address the limited relevance, particularly of independent or art film, as mediums through which collective imaginaries can be developed. If at certain points in the history of Latin American cinema, film had the ability to consolidate feelings of national kinship through the shared viewing habits of domestic audiences 24 (Poblete 2018, pp. 17-18, 21) , it was in fact commercial films \"for-the-masses\" where this was achieved. 25 Beyond these considerations, I contend that within the field of Peruvian cinema, Quispe Alarc\u00f3n's films and cinematic practices have played a substantial role. Thematically, his highly specific generational portrait, together with his understanding of the everyday as both a critical and aesthetic category (Crary, quoted in De Luca and Barradas Jorge 2016, p. 15 ) follow the spirit of Ranci\u00e8re's claim around the issue of aesthetic worthiness, reconfiguring who (and how) is worthy of being shown onscreen (De Luca and Barradas Jorge 2016, p. 14) . In sharp contrast to how many Peruvian films of the last two decades have represented young Lime\u00f1os of migrant origins as emblems of the neoliberal model, Quispe Alarc\u00f3n's critical exploration of their sociability, their romantic endeavours, their relationship with the urban fabric, and the societal and familial pressures they face, provides an alternative and complex portrait of this particular cohort.",

By refusing to make concessions to a consumer culture that for him has coopted much of the world, he continues to insist on the liberating power of cinema as an art form, and as such, demands that it should be a vehicle of inquiry, resistance, and rehumanization. His faith that film, like all art, \"when it is free, frees, when it is independent, brings about independence\" (Radio Lima Gris 2018) remains untouched. Understanding the camera neither \"as a rifle\" nor as an \"author's pen,\" but rather as a tool toward human emancipation and political engagement, the following words at the end of 6 summarize his position. Cinema is not made by filmmakers, nor by businesses, nor by advertising agencies, nor by production companies. Cinema is not made with money, but with ideas, with soul. Because it is an art and it needs to be human.",

            "text": "In sum, with respect to the position and role of cinema in society, Quispe Alarc\u00f3n's most valuable contribution to a field that is structurally defined-and fractured-by neoliberal commodification, is his attempt to restore cinema as \"a specific mode of human being-together\" (Ranci\u00e8re 1999, p. 101) which triggers spectators to think critically beyond themselves. Notes 1. This term was widely used within the New Latin American Cinema (NLAC) movement, particularly to refer to the role of cinema as an aggressive agent of political liberation whose precarious means of operation and perilous attitude-similar to that of the guerrilla soldier-were its tools for attacking the system (Getino and Solanas 1969a, b) . Over time, the term has been loosely used to refer to its anti-institutional nature, its precarious means, and its rejection of market forces. 2. For example, he collaborated on several film series at the now defunct Cine Club Cayetano Heredia, and organized the Ciclo Influencias (available for viewing on social media) at the Centro Cultural Olaya. One of his many future projects is a weekly online free program of live interaction with the public, where the discussion of a particular film would serve as the starting point for a wider analysis combining aesthetic, political, economic and socio-cultural issues (Quispe Alarc\u00f3n 2019). 3. These are the subsequent names of the offices in charge of supporting film and audiovisual projects within Peru's Ministry of Culture. CONACINE stands for the Consejo Nacional de Cinematograf\u00eda [National Cinema Council] and DAFO stands for the Direcci\u00f3n del Audiovisual, la Fonograf\u00eda y los Nuevos Medios [Directorate of Audiovisual, Sound Production, and New Media]. 4. This phrase inevitably reveals a desire to establish a link with the Nuevo cine argentino of the late 1990s in terms of the production practices and diverse set of experimental aesthetics of its filmmakers. In my view, though, the wider scope of the innovations and the continental influence of the Argentinian movement is hardly comparable with the Peruvian independent film of the early 2000s. 5. For an in-depth study of this festival's role in the national, regional and international cinema landscape, see Barrow (2016 Tompkins (2013, p. 2) states that in experimental film, innovation and critique occur from within an established tradition. 11. In spite of this, economic factors still have a notable influence on someone's capacity to make a film, as Quispe Alarc\u00f3n himself makes explicit in 6. 12. For a thorough discussion of the main characteristics of \"slow cinema\", see De Luca and Barradas Jorge (2016). 13. Mumblecore started with Andrew Bujalski's film Funny Ha Ha (2002) and ended around 2010 when the core directors and actors transitioned to more mainstream big budget productions. 14. Among many others, a quite different model of Peruvian collective filmmaking is the work done by the Escuela de Cine Amaz\u00f3nico, discussed by Claudia Arteaga in Chapter 16 of this volume. 15. In addition to Mumblecore, the work of other filmmakers who focus on generational portraits like Godard, Rohmer, and especially Perrone-who portrays the marginal youth of his hometown, Ituzaing\u00f3-has deeply inspired Quispe Alarc\u00f3n's work. 16. Gago's concept of \"neoliberalism from below\" emphasizes how neoliberal rationality \"is not purely abstract nor macropolitical, but arises from the encounter with forces at work and is embodied in various ways by the subjectivities and tactics of everyday life, as a variety of ways of doing, being and thinking that organize the social machinery's calculations and affects\" (2017, p. 2). While \"neoliberalism from below\" is an ample concept encompassing the multiple and heterogeneous ways in which neoliberal rationality is simultaneously enacted, contested and reinterpreted by subjects with different levels of agency in different spheres of their daily lives, the character of Quispe Alarc\u00f3n's 3 that I discuss in this section embodies how neoliberal rationality has become deeply rooted in popular subjectivities by conquering the psyche, and in this particular case, by directing affective life. 17. In Peruvian commercial cinema, an emblem of this type of \"participatory subject\" can be found in the protagonist of the \u00a1Asu mare! films. 18. As C\u00e1nepa Koch and Lossio Ch\u00e1vez (2019, p. 13 ) have further explained when discussing Marca Per\u00fa from a Foucauldian perspective, the mandate of this power device calls for Peruvian citizens to \"live the brand\". 19. This also happens in 4, although that film has no prologue or epilogue. 20. It is interesting to realize that this precarity is not exclusive to experimental cinema: as Martha Dietrich shows in her chapter in this volume, the same thing occurs in regional commercial filmmaking. A point of contact is then established between substantially different filmmaking practices like Quispe Alarc\u00f3n's and Ccorahua and Berrocal's in terms of the arduous obstacles faced to complete their films. 21. Getino and Solanas defined this concept by which a film projection was transformed into a political act which, in their view, liberated a territory and transformed its people thanks to the participation of \"the masses\" who, from being simple spectators, became actors by participating in post-screening debates. For more on \"cine-acto\", see Getino and Solanas (1969a, b, pp. 55-57) . 22. Other Peruvian film projects like Chaski's Microcines, Docuper\u00fa or the previously mentioned Escuela de Cine Amaz\u00f3nico, can be seen as being more directly inspired on this political objective. For example, in contrast to Quispe Alarc\u00f3n's strict \"no concessions\" stance, Microcines has a more flexible approach to making cinema an influential tool for many of the same objectives that he avows. For a thorough analysis of the Microcines project, see McClennen (2011) and Ross (2010) . 23. Some of these have already been held by grassroots organizations, academic institutions and even by corporations: examples are the screenings, discussions and workshops led by film critic M\u00f3nica Delgado at the former Cineclub de la Universidad Ciencias y Humanidades, or those at Espacio Fundaci\u00f3n Telef\u00f3nica. Most recently, there has been an upsurge of these type of public engagements in online cineclubs, forums and coverage of local festivals as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. 24. It should be noted that La revoluci\u00f3n y la tierra, a documentary that has gathered unprecedented acclaim and record numbers among Peruvian audiences, with sold-out shows has, to a small extent, made a step in this direction. 25. One of the few instances when this was possible was during the classic Golden Age of Latin American cinema in Mexico, Argentina and Brazil between 1930 and 1950 . For more on this, see Poblete (2018) . ",
