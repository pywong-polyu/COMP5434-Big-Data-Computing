Towards the end of 2020, several COVID-19 vaccine candidates with relatively high efficacy have been reported in the final phase of clinical trials. Vaccines have been considered as critical tools for opening up social and economic activities, thereby lessening the impact of this disease on the society. This paper presents a simulation of COVID-19 spread using modified Susceptible-Infected-Removed (SIR) model under vaccine intervention in several localities of Malaysia, i.e. those cities or states with high relatively COVID-19 cases such as Kuala Lumpur, Penang, Sabah, and Sarawak. The results show that at different vaccine efficacy levels (0.75, 0.85, and 0.95), the curves of active infection vary slightly, indicating that vaccines with efficacy above 0.75 would produce the herd immunity required to level the curves. In addition, disparity is significant between implementing or not implementing a vaccination program. Simulation results also show that lowering the reproduction number, R 0 is necessary to keep the infection curve flat despite vaccination. This is due to the assumption that vaccination is mostly carried out gradually at the assumed fixed rate. The statement is based on our simulation results with two values of R 0 : 1.1 and 1.2, indicative of reduction of R 0 by social distancing. The lower R 0 shows a smaller peak amplitude about half the value simulated with R 0 = 1.2. In conclusion, the simulation model suggests a two-pronged strategy to combat the COVID-19 pandemic in Malaysia: vaccination and compliance with standard operating * Corresponding author",

In Phase III trials, several COVID-19 vaccines demonstrated efficacy as high as 95% in preventing symptomatic COVID-19 infections [6] . Various levels of efficacy had been reported for the advance phases of clinical trials: Sinopharm (79%) [7] , Pfizer BioNTech (95%) [6] , Moderna (94.5%) [8] at advance phases of clinical trials. A survey was conducted in [9] to gauge the public acceptance of COVID-19 vaccines in 19 countries. From the results, 71.5% of respondents reported that they would be very or very likely to take vaccines and 61.4% reported accepting employer's recommendation to do so. Acceptance rate discrepancies ranged from almost 90% (China) to less than 55% (Russia).",

Further, we apply a modified Susceptible-Infected-Removed (SIR) model to incorporate constant vaccination rate based on the Malaysia Government's planning. SIR has been widely used to model COVID-19 pandemic spread [12, 13] . Note that mathematical modelling has been a long progressive field due to its inherent importance to health policy makers. This will help to answer some fundamental questions, such as the effectiveness of the vaccination program given various efficacy rates and current developments. However, it needs to be highlighted that these projections are only based on the proposed model. Furthermore, the modified SIR model does not take into account the stochasticity of the imported cases. This research will serve as a projection to observe the effects of vaccination at different efficacy rates and to show the importance of vaccination.",

Despite there are various methods, the principle remains the same i.e. to find some parameters which enable the model to represent the actual recorded data. Obviously, compartmental models have been highly popular in modeling COVID-19 as seen from massive research works in this area. SIR model was used to fit the COVID-19 data and then used to forecast the number of cases in Senegal [15] . In Italy, particle swarm optimization (PSO), a form of stochastic optimization method, was used to fit SEIR COVID-19 model to actual data [16] . Acu\u00f1a-Zegarra, et. al. [17] developed an optimal control problem to design vaccination strategies with various efficacy rates to gauge the COVID-19 pandemic situation. It was difficult to gauge the efficiency of the vaccine to provide immunity to the receivers as the clinical trials are based on procedures and evaluation based on the efficacy. SIR models have been developed for some countries (China, South Korea, India, Australia, and USA) [12] . In [13] , SIR model was created to analyze the effectiveness using the data from 15 European countries.",

This model is built on the premise that entire population can be divided into three states: susceptible (S), infected (I), and removed (R) states. The infected group continuously infects the population until isolation is performed. The assumption requires the recovered population to receive 100% immunity. The SIR model follows a deterministic model with linear infection rate. In [19] , the authors modified the existing SIR to be stochastic model and included vertical transmission and vaccination and non-linear incidence and vaccination. Current vaccination SIR models mostly consider newborn vaccination as a result of previous and ongoing efforts. However, the principles could be similarly applied in similar manner with slight modifications.",

The ratio of \u03b2 and \u03b3 is called as reproduction number, i.e. R 0 = \u03b2/\u03b3. Reproduction number shows the average number of secondary infections coming from an infected person assuming everyone is in susceptible state. In practice, the constant \u03b2 depends on how the society practice hygiene and social distancing adhering to the standard operating procedure and the constant \u03b3 is related to the people who have either recovered or deceased. The initial number of susceptible people, S(t = 0) can be found using the data released by the Government. From (4), we have S(t = 0) = N \u2212 R(t = 0) \u2212 I(t = 0). We can approximate I(t = 0) from the identification rate, p and the average ratio of asymptomatic and symptomatic cases, \u03d5. For Malaysia, we assume a fixed ratio of asymptomatic and symptomatic cases, i.e. \u03d5 = 0.7 [20] . Let X(t) be the number of new daily cases identified. The approximate number of initial infected cases is I(t = 0) = X(t = 0)/p \u00d7 0.7. Fig. 1 depicts the proposed state diagram. We introduce a new term, vaccination rate, d to the existing SIR model as shown in the figure. The vaccination rate is defined as the ratio of target population and completion time.

The government is also in final negotiations with China's Sinovac for 14 million doses, CanSino Biologics for 3.5 million doses, and and Russia for 6.4 million shots of Sputnik V vaccine [23] . However, it is clear that most vaccines will arrive only in the second and third quarter of 2021 onwards based on projections. In fact, the Malaysian Government has expressed the desire to cover 80% of the population [24] . In this paper, we assume that the vaccination rate is constant and that 75% of the target population will be vaccinated within a year. The figure is reasonable as the inked deals have already covered almost 50% of the Malaysian population (see the cumulative percentage in Table 2 ).",

Hence, our simulation will start from the second quarter of 2021. This is a proper figure to simulate the realistic scenario.

Note that herd immunity can only be reached if about 70% of the population is immune to the virus.
