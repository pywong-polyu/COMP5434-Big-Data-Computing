Many countries in this region instituted nationwide public health control measures (e.g., social distancing requirements, stay-at-home orders) to minimize the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce the burden of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on health systems. Although such measures are designed to flatten the curve of SARS-CoV-2 transmission, they often present unique direct and indirect consequences for specific subpopulations. This paper provides an analysis of the implications of COVID-19 and related public health interventions for the well-being of children and young people (CYP) 1 living in ESA.

COVID-19 is likely to adversely affect the many CYP living with HIV in the region, especially those who are not aware that they are HIV positive and those with unsuppressed viral loads and low CD4 counts. Estimates from countries in ESA (e.g., Kenya, South Africa) indicate that up to 37% of HIV positive CYP are living with unsuppressed viral loads (3, 4) . Unsuppressed viral loads (and low CD4 counts) increase vulnerability to opportunistic infections, including respiratory-related conditions (5) . HIV testing must be paired with SARS-CoV-2 testing to detect the concurrent presence of these viruses in CYP. Those who test positive for SARS-CoV-2 should be monitored closely (if asymptomatic) or treated for COVID-19 symptoms, whereas those who test positive for HIV should immediately be placed on antiretroviral treatment (ART). The latter is particularly important for young people who are at increased risk of being severely affected by COVID-19, including those who have not disclosed their HIV status and those who defer seeking HIV treatment during the pandemic. For CYP on ART, continuation of comprehensive ART is crucial to achieving optimal adherence and viral suppression.",

This will ensure that patients have enough treatment during stay-at-home orders and limit unnecessary visits to health care facilities, thereby reducing the risk of exposure to SARS-CoV-2.

Measles immunization campaigns have been delayed in 24 countries and will be canceled in 13 others, with millions of children missing out on immunization activities during the pandemic (8) . Many countries in ESA already had sub-optimal rates of immunization for vaccinable diseases (e.g., measles, polio) before the COVID-19 pandemic. For example, 2018 estimates indicate that Angola and Ethiopia accounted for 45% of all infants in ESA who were un-or under-vaccinated for diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis (9) . Immunization activities in this region are likely to be disrupted by social responses to COVID-19 (e.g., reluctance to attend vaccination sessions for fear of exposure) and the effects of public health control measures (e.g., border closures and travel disruptions can impact vaccine accessibility). These conditions raise the risk of sudden outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases occurring when social distancing restrictions are eased. For children who already have a compromised immune system (e.g., those living with HIV), likelihood of mortality from vaccinepreventable conditions (e.g., measles) is higher if immunizations are not received (10) .",

Government-sponsored school nutritional programs (e.g., feeding schemes) are prevalent in many countries in the region (17) . Closing schools immediately restricts access to these programs, which many children depend on. Poor nutrition has been associated with worse educational outcomes in children, weakened immune systems, susceptibility to opportunistic infections, and premature mortality (18) . During periods of prolonged school closures, there is a need to ensure children continue to have access to food.

Government and private sector partnerships with schools are needed to provide learners and caregivers with resources to facilitate meaningful remote learning opportunities. Basic Education Ministries should identify ways of supplying learners with printed reading materials through community health workers and community centers that are applying COVID-19 safety measures. Caregivers of children must be given support to implement simple routines that maintain typical eating windows, incorporate time for educational activities (e.g., reading), and include recreational activities that adhere to public health control measures. Teachers should be encouraged to stay in regular contact with learners and caregivers during school closures to ensure that learners understand and can engage with educational material. Teachers also need to be trained to remotely teach children living with disabilities, and caregivers should be given assistance with making distance learning accessible to children with disabilities. In low-income countries, radio and television education broadcasts may be more effective than e-learning (22) . Rapidly creating age-and grade-appropriate educational radio and television programs in different languages can support learning during school closures.",

For example, South Africa has implemented the COVID-19 Social Relief of Distress grant that is paid to individuals who are currently unemployed and do not receive any other form of social grant. While cash transfers can assist many low-income households, this may not be sufficient to avert food insecurity. Large-scale roll out of food assistance programs (e.g., food banks) in both urban and rural areas is needed to supplement cash transfers, ensure access to life-sustaining food, and prevent social unrest and hunger riots. Food security at home could be improved through home-delivered meals facilitated by local organizations (e.g., NGOs, municipalities). School feeding programs need to be reintroduced, with the option of community sites becoming key distribution points that are accompanied by screening for COVID-19 symptoms, follow-up, and monitoring of children from affected households. Therapeutic nutrition ought to be provided to children who are malnourished or receiving ART. In the long-term, providing lower-income households with direct livelihood support through financed projects to develop small scale livestock and agricultural activities will both support child nutrition and mitigate the strain of food shortages and increases in food prices.",
