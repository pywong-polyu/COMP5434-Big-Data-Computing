In addition, the daily sentiment scores of COVID-19 related tweets in the United Kingdom were higher than those in the United States in general, which suggests that the COVID-19 related tweets in the United Kingdom had a more positive attitude towards COVID-19 than those in the United States. Moreover, the United Kingdom had a large proportion of topics with positive attitudes, such as gratitude and support, while in the United States, a large proportion of topics were about the pandemic and cases. This might be due to the smaller number of daily new COVID-19 cases in the United Kingdom than in the United States. While the sentiments scores towards the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States were more negative than those in the United Kingdom, the daily trends of the number of COVID-19 tweets and their corresponding sentiment scores in these two countries fluctuated. This result may be that the Twitter users were influenced by the announcement of major policies related to COVID-19 and some celebrities tested positive for COVID-19. For example, while the World Health Organization declared the outbreak a pandemic on March 11, 2020 [3], and the United Kingdom government announced \u00a3330 billion of loans to support businesses on March 17, 2020 [19], the number of COVID-19 tweets had peaks in both the United Kingdom and the United States.
