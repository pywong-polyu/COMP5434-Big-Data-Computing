We revealed three areas that are rich of IgG epitopes, two are on Spike protein but outside of RBD, and one is on Nucleocapsid protein. We identified 29 significant epitopes on Spike protein, from two of these significant epitopes, two critical epitope residues were found, i. e., D936 and P1263, which are highly related to the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2. In summary, we provided the first global map of IgG binding epitopes for SARS-CoV-2 at single amino acid resolution. This map will facilitate the precise development of therapeutic antibodies and vaccines.",

Vaccines and therapeutic antibodies of high effectivity are desperately needed. It is known that SARS-CoV-2 encodes 27 proteins, of these proteins, Spike protein (S protein) plays a critical role in the specific binding of SARS-CoV-2 to human cells. During the infection, specific proteases cut S protein at S2' and furin site to split S1 and S2 (4) . S protein is rich of N-glycosylation, i. e., 21 sites (5).",

The comprehensive and in-depth revealing of SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG responses will definitely help us to understand the COVID-19 immunity better, and to facilitate the precise development of neutralization antibodies and vaccines. To reveal the SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG response, several studies have been performed through different angles by applying different strategies. By analyzing 55 convalescent sera on a SARS-CoV-2 proteome microarray, the IgG responses against 18 SARS-CoV-2 proteins were surveyed, including S1, S2, N and RBD (16) . By analyzing sera from 1,051 patients on a S protein peptide microarray of full S protein coverage, several areas and a set of peptides of high IgG reactivity were identified (14) . Similar studies were also performed by using another peptide microarray (17) , and a coronavirus specific phage displayed peptide library (19) . The IgG responses on protein and peptide levels, but not single amino acid level, were at least partially revealed by these studies.",

To check this possibility, we divided sum_epitopes by the length of the proteins, indeed, the variation of the sum_epitopes among protein was largely normalized. However, there are still significant variations for sum_epitopes/ length among the proteins, from 0 for ORF6 to 0.08 for NSP9, these differences may be due to the accessibility of these proteins to the immune system during infection, further study may be needed to address this.",

We then plotted the epitopes, the epitopes sequences, and the frequencies alongside the linear sequence and domains of S protein (Fig. 3A) . The results clearly showed that the epitopes are distributed cross but not evenly on S protein. Two hot areas that rich of significant epitopes were readily identified, the first area almost covers the entire CTD (C terminal domain), the second area covers the S2' protease cleavage site and the fusion peptide (FP). Significant epitopes were also identified on the cytoplasmic C-terminal end of S protein. These results are highly consistent to a peptide microarray-based study, of which about 4,000 samples were analyzed against a set of 197 peptides that covers the entire S protein (14, 15) .",

To further illustrate the location and distribution of the 28 significant epitopes (Fig. S3A) , we mapped them to the 3D structure of Spike protein (23) monomer ( Fig. 3B) and trimer (Fig. S3B) . It is clear that most of these epitopes locate on the surface of Spike protein, which is consistent to the common notion (24). However, Epitope-S1-6 (KCVNFNFN) and Epitope-S2-3 (QEVFAQVK) are not on the surface of the trimeric Spike protein, but on the surface of the monomer. A plausible explanation is that specific areas of the Spike protein monomer could be exposed to the immune system during the infection. To further pinpoint the locations of the critical residues of the significant epitopes, we took 4 critical epitope residues, i. e., K558, P561, Q563 and Q564 from a significant epitope as examples (Fig. 3C) . As expected, all these residues locate on the surface of S protein (Fig. 3D) . To check the similarity of the epitopes/ critical epitope residues among human coronaviruses, we performed homology analysis for Epitope-S1-8 (KFLPFQQF) (Fig. S3A) .

A recent study surveyed the functional roles of a variety of SARS-CoV-2 S protein mutants, and identified a set of point mutations that cause significant reduction of the infectivity (29). To explore the roles of the critical epitope residues, we matched the mutation sites with the epitope map of S protein (Fig. 3A) , we found three mutation sites are also critical epitope residues, i. e., H49Y, D936Y and P1263L. Except H49Y, D936Y and P1263L could cause 60-70% and 98-99% infectivity loss, respectively. This strongly suggest that D936 and P1263 are critical for maintaining the proper activity of S protein. According to the 2019 Novel Coronavirus Resource (2019nCoVR) database of China National Center for Bioinformation (CNCB) (https://bigd.big.ac.cn/ncov/), those three mutation sites are also of high frequency (Fig. S4D) . Taken together, it is reasonable to argue that D936 and P1263 may could serve as very promising targets for neutralization antibody and vaccine development.",

However, these platforms could not provide epitope information at amino acid level, and pathogen specific protein or peptide library need to be constructed individually, which is costly and time-consuming. Alternatively, random peptide libraries were attempted for dissecting pathogen specific IgG responses from sera (34, 35). For SARS-CoV-2, following the protocol of testing serum directly that we established (34), and the K-TOPE algorithm (35), we tried to profile the virus specific IgG responses at proteome level. However, most of the identified epitopes that match the sequence of SARS-CoV-2 proteins are of low frequency. This indicates a more powerful algorithm is needed to dig meaningful epitopes for the random peptide-based strategy. We then simplified the data analysis part by combining MEME and FIMO (36, 37), and identified a set of epitopes of marginly statistical significance (Fig. 1) . To experimentally improve the performance of AbMap, we tried to reduce the noise by enriching SARS-CoV-2 specific IgGs using specific proteins or peptides, a larger number of high confident epitopes were identified as compared to that of testing serum directly.",

According to a SARS-CoV-2 specific peptide library based study (19) , the highly immunogenic regions of Spike protein were also enriched in CTD, region around S2' and the fusion peptide, and HR2, which are highly consistent to our study. While aa362-399 of N protein which identified as high immunogenic region was also determined in our study, but other highly immunogenic regions were not. The inconsistence may be due to the different sample size and the differences of the detailed protocol. According to a peptide microarray (17), 3 of the 6 Spike protein epitopes identified by microarray for serum IgG were also determined as significant epitopes in our study, and aa366-400 of N protein which identified as a long epitope for serum IgG was also enriched in our study. Compared to these epitope related studies, our study can serve as an independent cross validation because of the high consistence. Furthermore, this study is the first of such that providing global IgG epitope information at single amino acid level.",

            "text": "There are a variety of possible applications for the significant epitopes/ critical residues identified in this study. According to S protein, most of the significant epitopes (Fig. S3A) are on the surface of the 3D structure, it is reasonable to argue that the significant epitopes (including that from S protein) are naturally of high immunogenicity. Thus, for a given application, one can select one or a few epitopes to generate site specific antibody on demand for S protein as well as other proteins. High frequencies were observed for some of the epitopes, e. g., Epitope-S1-8 (KFKPFQQF), it is possible this epitope could be used alone or in combination with other epitope for diagnostics. It is known that areas other than RBD on S protein (13, 38) , and furthermore, other than RBM on RBD (receptor binding motif) (8, 39) may also elicit potent neutralization antibodies. Once determined, the corresponding epitopes could be used directly as vaccine or as immunogen for generating site-specific neutralization antibody. Since the COVID-19 pandemic is unfolding and the sequenced genomes of SARS-CoV-2 is piling up (https://bigd.big.ac.cn/ncov/), undoubtedly, more functionally important amino acid sites will be identified, we can match those sites to the identified critical epitope residues, thus link mutation or SARS-CoV-2 evolution with immune responses. Except for the applications that we discuss here, it is anticipated that more applications of the identified significant epitopes/ critical epitope residues could be explored.",
