Serological assays commonly used to measure antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 displayed a range of sensitivities that declined to varying extents over time. Quantitative measurements generated by serological assays based on the spike protein were better at predicting neutralising antibody titres than those based on nucleocapsid, but performance was variable, and manufacturer positivity thresholds were not able to predict the presence or absence of detectable neutralising activity. Although we observed some deterioration in correlation between serological measurements and functional neutralisation activity, some assays maintained an ability to predict neutralising titres, even against variants of concern.",

Although PCR-based assays remain a reliable and sensitive test for infection, they are not amenable to mass population screening. Therefore, serological assays, despite limitations, [1] [2] [3] have been instrumental for surveillance and providing selection criteria to recruit participants for vaccine trials and convalescent plasma donors. Monitoring antibody titres is necessary to measure the magnitude and longevity of immune responses induced by natural infection or vaccination. As immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 antigens are increasingly elicited by infection, vaccination, or both, the measurement of antibody titres and the ability of such measurements to predict protection from infection or disease will be of great importance. Whether simple serological tests will be able to predict neutralising antibody titres and immunity to SARS-CoV-2 is yet to be determined. Moreover, as antibodies mature and acquire greater affinity while their total levels decline [4] [5] [6] and new SARS-CoV-2 variants emerge, the predictive value of serological tests based on the prototype viral strain will need to be evaluated.",

Although several studies have correlated serological measurements with neutralisation activity in SARS-CoV-2 infection, at the time of submission, only three papers in peerreviewed journals have directly assessed the ability of commercial, high-throughput serological assays used in routine clinical practice to predict functional neutralising activity. The first study was done in 190 patients in New York (NY, USA) and compared the ability of two commercial serological assays with that of a lateral flow assay and three ELISA assays to predict neutralising titres in serum samples obtained shortly after infection (about 30 days). This study concluded that the variation in neutralising antibody titres was variably predicted by the commercial assays. The second study was done in a cohort overlapping with the current study (97 participants) from the National Health Service hospitals in Scotland and evaluated the performance of four serological assays with serum samples collected over a period of up to about 84 days post-infection. The study showed that neutralising activity declined over time and that declining neutralising titres were not predicted by serological assays. The third study was done in a cohort of 40 patients in St Louis (MO, USA) and compared values obtained by use of three commercial serological assays with neutralisation titres obtained shortly post-infection (about 30 days). The study reported that the assays evaluated were not optimal for predicting neutralisation. At present, several high-throughput serological assays are routinely used to measure SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, but their ability to predict immunity has not been evaluated. Importantly, none of the previous studies extended beyond about 80 days post-infection, and none evaluated the ability of the serological assays to predict functional antibody activity against variants of concern.",

Our analysis substantially expands our previous study in extending the time of sample acquisition from 80 days to 140 days, increasing the number of serological assays evaluated from four to ten and including variants of concern. Our study showed that neutralising antibody titres declined shortly after infection but stabilised thereafter. The serological assays did not accurately reflect this initial decline. Diagnostic sensitivity of each assay declined to widely varying extents over time. Manufacturer assay diagnostic cutoffs were not suitable for accurate prediction of the presence or absence of serum neutralising activity. Nevertheless, quantitative values measured with some high-throughput serological assays based on the spike protein correlated well with serum neutralising titres over time, even when neutralisation activity was measured against variants of concern.",

We determined the ability of 58 serum samples obtained at visits 1 and 5 to neutralise selected variants of concern of the alpha, beta, and delta lineages that have been associated with partial resistance to neutralisation. [13] [14] [15] Serum samples from both visits were able to neutralise viruses carrying the alpha spike, with potencies similar to those observed with the Wuhanhu-1 spike protein (figure 4A, appendix p 8). By contrast, titres against viruses with the alpha variant with Glu484Lys amino acid substitution, delta variant, or either of the two beta spike variants were decreased by approxi mately 2\u00b75-5\u00b70-times at visit 1 (figure 4A, appendix p 8). Differences between the ability to neutralise Wuhan-hu-1 and variant spike-bearing viruses became somewhat less pronounced at visit 5 ( figure 4A) . Therefore, the inclusion of amino acid substitution Glu484Lys in the context of the alpha variant or substitutions found in the spikes from other variants of concern appeared to substantially reduce neutralisation titres, with the largest effect seen with substitutions found in the beta variants, consistent with previous reports. 6, [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] Overall, the correlation of antibody levels, as measured by serological assays, with neutralising activity was marginally weaker for variant pseudotyped viruses than for the Wuhan-hu-1 variant (figure 4B, appendix p 9).

Moreover, the widespread use of vaccines necessitates the accurate determination of the vaccination and immune status of individuals. Highthroughput serological assays address these needs, but their usefulness obviously depends on their accuracy and reliability. In this study, we compared the results provided by several SARS-CoV-2 serological assays, with an emphasis on their ability to predict neutralisation activity as antibodies both wane and evolve and SARS-CoV-2 variants emerge. 4, 8 The study limitations include the sample size of 112 individuals, of which a small proportion were lost to follow-up during the study. Participants predominantly had mild disease, with few being admitted to hospital, and the findings might not be applicable to individuals with severe COVID-19 disease. Nevertheless, our cohort is representative of a large proportion of the infected participants and for correlations of neutralisation and serological data by use of assays based on antigens derived from closely related sequences. And although the levels of neutralising antibodies required for robust protection against currently circulating variants are unknown, neutralising antibodies are recognised as a correlate of protection. We used a pseudotyped virus assay to measure neutralising titres, but we note that titres obtained with the assay used herein correlate very well with those obtained against live SARS-CoV-2. 10 Serological assays are generally optimised for increased sensitivity, so they can reliably diagnose the presence or absence of antibodies against viral antigens. 1, 19 Most of the assays we used accomplished this goal with serum samples obtained shortly after infection; however, their sensitivity was not always maintained over time, and some assays showed a sharp decline in sensitivity at later timepoints after infection. The reason for the difference in assay trajectories over time is unclear, but it might reflect differences in assay dependence on antibody concentrations versus affinity. This loss of sensitivity was not related to the antigen on which the assays were based.",

            "text": "Serological assays also provide a quantitative result that could enable their use for estimation of antibody levels and prediction of immunity, especially if antibody levels correlate with functional neutralising antibody titres. Assays that detect spike-binding antibodies can use various protein subdomains or conformations (eg, isolated RBD, S1 subunit, or a stabilised trimeric spike) as their antigens. Moreover, some assays only detect specific antibody classes such as IgG, or those that directly interfere with RBD receptor binding. By contrast, neutralisation assays detect all antibodies capable of inhibiting spike-mediated virus entry into cells. Although neutralising antibodies are sometimes dominated by those targeting RBD, 20, 21 including those that block ACE2 binding, antibodies targeting the N-terminal domain of the S1 subunit can substantially contribute to the overall serum neutralisation activity in plasma. [22] [23] [24] Weak neutralising activity has also been ascribed to antibodies targeting the region of the S2 subunit involved in fusion. 25 Multiple studies have shown that neutralising antibody titres after natural infection or vaccination wane over time, 4, 8, 11, 12, 26 a decline that is not always accurately reflected by serological assays. Nevertheless, some of the assays we used that detect spike-specific antibodies maintained good levels of correlation with neutralising titres over time. Assays measuring spike-specific IgG antibodies predicted neutralising antibody titres more accurately than those measuring total antibodies against spike or those against the nucleocapsid protein. The DiaSorin assays, Abbott IgGII Quant, Siemens sCOVG, Euroimmun, and cPass had the highest correlation with neutralising antibody titres across all comparisons, and changes in quantitative values over time for these assays were most closely correlated with changes in neutralising antibody levels within individuals. Although the cPass assay is designed to measure antibodies that block the interaction between RBD and ACE2, it correlated with neutralising antibody titres as well as the best of the serological assays that measure antibodies to the entire spike protein. Therefore, although the cPass assay does not measure all neutralising antibodies, this finding suggests that antibodies that block RBD-ACE2 interaction either dominate the overall population of neutralising antibodies or correlate with overall neutralising antibody levels.",

            "text": "The need for serological assays in monitoring natural infection at the population level remains. Moreover, the introduction of vaccines raises new requirements for serological assays. These requirements include the distinction between individuals who were vaccinated and those who were naturally infected, the prognostication of levels of protection against infection and disease afforded by vaccines, and the identification of individuals for whom a boosting immunisation or monoclonal antibody therapy is indicated. Furthermore, in instances where countries are considering deploying so-called immunity passports to allow, for example, travel, the selection of assays and the diagnostic cutoff used can have important ramifications. Finally, since the measurement of antibody function (eg, neutralisation) at a population level is not practical, establishing the ability of serological assays to predict neutralisation and immunity will help determine correlates of protection that can be applied at a large scale and, perhaps, as part of routine clinical practice.",
