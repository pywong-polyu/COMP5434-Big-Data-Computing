For example, a decrease in the GpX-1 level will lead to an increase in the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), activation of NF-\u03baB transcription, and an increase in oxidative stress and cell apoptosis [3] . Se is a well-known inhibitor of NF-kB and appears to decrease NF-kB-induced apoptosis and induce cytokine storms related to severe COVID-19 [4] . Recent studies have shown that the levels of selenoprotein P and GpX worldwide are borderline or below-optimal, even in many European countries [5] . A study in China found that the mean hair selenium level was high in a Chinese city with a high COVID-19 recovery rate and low in cities with high COVID-19 mortality rates [6] . Another population-based study and one cross-sectional study showed that Se deficiency correlated with the risk of COVID-19 mortality [7] .",

Ex-vivo studies showed that a low Zn level increased the permeability of the epithelium of the respiratory tract [10] and Zn supplementation enhanced lung integrity by inducing the expression of tight junction proteins (i.e. ZO-1 and claudin-1) [11] . Moreover, high Zn levels protect the lung from damage caused by mechanical ventilation [12] .

Deficient patients had higher rates of hospital stay, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and mortality []. Finding no association between Zn level and disease severity, could be explained by the stronger effect of confounding factors. Also it could in part be explained by the very low Zn serum levels in studied subjects. Serum Zn level in the majority of studied population was below 70 mcg/ml that considered as the minimum of the normal serum range [30] . Zn adequacy is required to provide its immune-enhancing, anti-inflammatory, and other protective effects in COVID-19 patients. Available evidence also suggests that Zn deficiency is highly prevalent in Iran secondary to high phytate intake [31] .",

Furthermore, due to the observational structure of the current study, we couldn't describe the cause and effect relationship between serum Zn and Se level and COVID-19. Hence, further prospective cohort studies are needed. Another limitation of the present study was that we failed to follow up and assess patients in different stages of disease as we only collected the serum Se and Zn levels once at the onset of admission to hospital. However, it is recommended to be considered for further research in this field of study. According to the existing methodological issue, the current study results should be considered cautiously. Moreover, further studies are need to explore whether Zn and Se supplementation can improve COVID-19 characteristics and if so, unfold the undiscovered cellular or molecular mechanisms regarding the alleviating impact of this minerals on COVID-19 symptoms.",

In addition to age and inflammatory biochemical parameters, to a lesser extent, Zn and Se level could take part in predicting COVID-19 severity. Although the results of the current study is promising, the hypothesis still need to be tested by thoroughly monitored interventional studies under high quality standards to enlighten the potential role of Se and Zn in COVID19 disease and unfold probable adverse relation between this mineral's level and COVID-19.",
