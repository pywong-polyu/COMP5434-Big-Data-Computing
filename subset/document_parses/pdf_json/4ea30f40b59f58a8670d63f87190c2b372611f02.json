            "text": "Based on the achievement goal theory, this experimental study explored the influence of predictive and descriptive learning analytics dashboards on graduate students' motivation and statistics anxiety in an online graduate-level statistics course. Participants were randomly assigned into one of three groups: (a) predictive dashboard, (b) descriptive dashboard, or (c) control (i.e., no dashboard). Measures of motivation and statistical anxiety were collected in the beginning and the end of the semester via the Motivated Strategies for Learning Questionnaire and Statistical Anxiety Rating Scale. Individual semi-structured interviews were used to understand learners' perceptions of the course and whether the use of the dashboards influenced the meaning of their learning experiences. Results indicate that, compared to the control group, the predictive dashboard significantly reduced learners' interpretation anxiety and had an effect on intrinsic goal orientation that depended on learners' lower or higher initial levels of intrinsic goal orientation. In comparison to the control group, both predictive and descriptive dashboards reduced worth of anxiety (negative attitudes towards statistics) for learners who started the course with higher levels of worth anxiety. Thematic analysis revealed that learners who adopted a more performanceavoidance goal orientation approach demonstrated higher levels of anxiety regardless of the dashboard used.",

Unfortunately, statistics is perceived as a difficult subject by many learners (DeVaney, 2016; Hanna et al., 2008) and, as a result, many learners develop negative feelings towards statistics courses, statistics content, and even statistics instructors. Not surprisingly, statistics anxiety has been explored in numerous studies as part of a broader conceptualization that involves math anxiety, self-efficacy, motivation, and goal orientation (Hsu et al., 2009; Onwuegbuzie, 2004; Zeidner, 1991) . Importantly, statistics anxiety may be compounded in online learning environments due to lack of immediate feedback from instructors and the requirements for great levels of metacognitive skills as well as proficiency in technology, especially when statistical software is used (Hsu et al., 2009; Zimmerman, 2008) . This is a critical issue because online learning continues to grow and has dramatically expanded as a function of the public health crisis created by the COVID-19 virus. If most academic leaders (66%) already considered online learning as an essential part of their long-term strategies (Allen & Seaman, 2014) , this focus is likely to become even more prominent now that many educational institutions have developed their own structures to offer online instruction.",

More specifically, we designed and tested two learning analytics dashboards -predictive self-referenced vs. descriptive norm-referenced (Biesinger & Crippen, 2010; Koenka & Anderman, 2019) -to explore how different design and pedagogical features influence learners' motivation, statistics anxiety, and learning performance in an introductory online statistics course. In this study, learning analytics dashboards are presented as visual displays of customized feedback on learning performance and information about the course timeline (Park & Jo, 2015; Tan et al., 2017) . Despite the increasing interest in the potential of learning analytics to support learners' reflection, behavioral changes, motivation, and learning performance (Ga\u0161evi\u0107 et al., 2015; Park & Jo, 2019) , empirical studies investigating the influence of learning analytics dashboards on learners' cognitive and affective outcomes are still limited (Bodily & Verbert, 2017; Jivet et al., 2018) , particularly in authentic settings such as online statistics courses and that are based on an experimental design. This study represents a step to fill this void.",

For example, when learners are anxious about underperforming in an exam, this negative emotion can impact their ability to employ appropriate metacognitive strategies. On the other hand, when learners are intrinsically motivated to learn the content, they are more likely to develop positive emotions and employ appropriate learning strategies (Linnenbrink-Garcia et al., 2016) . Despite the interactions between motivation and anxiety, there is a lack of research on how theories of motivation can be used to develop learning analytics tools, such as learning analytics dashboards, to support learners' motivation (Bodily & Verbert, 2017; Lonn et al., 2015) and learning performance in anxiety-inducive courses such as statistics. This practical and theoretical gap guided the design and implementation of the present study.",

Based on this newer 2 \u00d7 2 model of goal orientation, learners with performance-approach goals want to demonstrate ability and competency in comparison to othersnormative goal theory (Harackiewicz et al., 2002) whereas learners with performance-avoidance goals do not want to be perceived as incompetent. Similarly, learners with mastery-approach goals focus on the mastery of the content while those with mastery-avoidance goals worry about not learning the content (Pintrich, 2000b) . In addition to this 2 \u00d7 2 goal orientation model, another model involves self-based approach goals (e.g., Personal-Best goals, 3 \u00d7 2 model: task goals, self-goals and other goals), which focus on learners' prior performance and experiences (Elliot et al., 2011) . It is worth noting that self-based goals align with mastery goals, in which performance is based on the individual's own learning progress in relation to prior performance.",

This approach is referred to as the multiple goal perspective in contrast to the traditional normative goal theory, which proposes that mastery and performance goal orientations are mutually exclusive (Harackiewicz et al., 2002) .

The design of the dashboards was based on the multiple goal orientation perspective (Harackiewicz et al., 2002) , where elements from the performance approach (e.g., focus on predicted letter grades) and the mastery goal approach (e.g., focus on the content or skills to be learned) orientations are combined to support learners' motivation. Importantly, the use of visual feedback based on learners' performance in the course was included in the design of the dashboards because it supports learners' formative assessment and self-regulated learning (Fabiano et al., 2018; Nicol & Macfarlane-Dick, 2006) . Thus, the design of the dashboards were based on the premise that monitoring of performance is related to metacognitive processes, self-regulated learning, and motivation profiles (Baars & Wijnia, 2018) . For example, learners may use the information about their performance to regulate how much time and effort they should spend studying the course material.",

The letter grades were color-coded to facilitate their identification in the dashboard. Letter grade predictions were updated weekly as the semester progressed according to learner performance on weekly quizzes, using a Na\u00efve Bayes model, a popular machine learning method presented in Appendix A. The mastery goal elements were represented by the focus on the content to be covered in each module (e.g., summary statistics, ANOVA) and on the \"learning progression\" of individual learners (Fig. 2 ). For example, the green line in Fig. 2 . shows that, based on the quizzes results up to module 5, the probability of this particular individual receiving a letter grade A at the end of the course is 78% whereas the probability a B grade is 21%. This dashboard represented a self-referenced Fig. 2 Predictive learning analytics dashboard design approach, where the predictions were pertinent to individual learners only, without class comparison elements such as predictions about other students in the class. Based on the goal orientation literature, a self-referenced dashboard can reduce competition and anxiety among learners as the focus is on the individual learner and his or her own progress in the course (Elliot & McGregor, 1999; Lavasani et al., 2014) . To inform students about the inherent limitations of predictive models, the following disclaimer was included in the dashboard display \"These probabilities are based on data from previous semesters of students with similar performance and, therefore, are not 100% accurate\".",

For this study, we used only the motivational scale, which has 31 items representing six factors and 3 areas of the motivation construct: (a) value, (b) expectancy, and (c) affective components. The value component subscale measures learners' goals and value beliefs and consists of three subconstructs: (a) intrinsic goal orientation, (b) extrinsic goal orientation, and (c) task value. The expectancy component subscale reflects learners' expectancy beliefs for completing the task and corresponds to two subconstructs: self-efficacy and control beliefs for learning. Finally, the affective component subscale addresses test anxiety (Pintrich et al., 1993) and does not have any subconstruct. The instrument was presented using a 7-point Likert-style scale, where 1 and 7 represented \"Not at all true of me\" and \"Very true of me,\" respectively. For each participant, final scores for each factor were computed by summing the items representing that factor and taking an average. Thus, final scores for each factor range from 1 to 7. Cronbach's alpha results for the MSLQ instrument ranged from 0.65 to 0.94 for the pre-surveys and from 0.67 to 0.95 for post-surveys. There were only small differences regarding Cronbach's alpha values from pre-to post-surveys within subconstructs.

We used the STARS version adapted by Hanna et al. (2008) and the instrument was presented using a 5-point Likert-style scale.

Seven females and three males agreed to participate in the interviews. The interviews lasted between 12 min and 33 min (mean = 18.5 min) and were conducted by two of the authors. Although most of the interviews were face-to-face, there were a few online interviews (n = 3). It is worth noting that each interviewer conducted interviews with at least one participant from each group. This was a deliberate decision to account for the role of the researcher as an instrument (Creswell & Poth, 2018) . Following the IRB approved protocol, pseudonyms were used in the transcripts to protect the privacy of the participants.

Interpretation anxiety is a construct that measures learners' anxiety to deal with data or solve statistical problems. This result suggests that, compared to learners in the control group, the predictive dashboard decreased learners' interpretation anxiety. More specifically, the model indicated that learners in the predictive dashboard had on average significantly lower interpretation anxiety scores at the end of the course than those in the control group. For example, learners with pre-interpretation anxiety scores of 2 are predicted to have, on average, 0.12 lower post-interpretation anxiety scores in the predictive group compared to the control group. It is worth noting that the effect of the interaction of the predictive dashboard group and pre-interpretation anxiety scores approached statistical significance ( pre_interp_anx * predictive = \u22120.20, p = 0.053 ). This interaction helps to explain why there was also a noticeable increase in final interpretation anxiety scores for the predictive group for those who started the course with higher levels of interpretation anxiety in comparison to the control group. For example, learners with pre-interpretation anxiety scores of 4 are predicted to have, on average, 0.28 higher post-interpretation anxiety scores in the predictive group compared to the control group (Fig. 6b) .",

This effect is particularly evident for those learners who started the course with higher levels of worth of statistics anxiety (e.g., pre-worth anxiety = 4). For these learners, being on the predictive or descriptive dashboards was helpful to lower their negative attitudes towards statistics (worth of Fig. 6 Relationship between pre and post \"Interpretation anxiety\" scores for students in the control, descriptive, and predictive treatments.

The adoption of the multiple goal orientation perspective (Harackiewicz et al., 2002) enabled us to use these concepts in the design of the (self-referenced) predictive and (norm-referenced) descriptive dashboards. The use a conceptual framework also gave us the necessary theoretical frame to interpret the influence of these design elements on learners' cognitive and affective responses (Antonenko, 2015; Jivet et al., 2018) . The attention to, and evaluation of, learners' affective outcomes as an integral part of the study represents an important practical and theoretical contribution because affective outcomes have been neglected in most learning analytics dashboard studies despite their influence on learners' satisfaction and learning outcomes, particularly in computer-based learning environments (Duffy & Azevedo, 2015; Jivet et al., 2018; Schunk et al., 2014; Zimmerman, 2008) .",

This is interesting because the self-referenced approach emphasizes learning progress relative to the individual's own progress in the course, which has been described as an optimal pedagogical approach to support intrinsic motivation (Elliot & McGregor, 1999; Lavasani et al., 2014) .",

Additionally, learners' lack of familiarity with predictive models and how they function may also have impacted learners' motivation. In particular, some students may have expected predictions that were more aligned with their grades in a given module when, in reality, some modules and assignments are more influential than others in the predictive model. For example, earning 100% on a relatively easy module in which everybody usually does very well is unlikely to substantially increase the predicted letter grade whereas relatively small performance differences in a more challenging module may dramatically influence predicted outcomes. This lack of familiarity with how predictive models work was reflected in the feedback by a female student who said \"It [predictive dashboard] was nice, but at times made me nervous. Even when my grade was overall very high, it still showed a high possibility of me getting a B in the class, which was a little nerve wracking.\"",

It is possible that the lack of contextual, normreferenced information may have contributed to an increase of self-oriented perfectionism among less motivated learners. Self-perfectionism refers to the \"intrapersonal dimension of perfectionism,\" where learners may develop unreasonable high standards for their performance, which may lead to self-criticism and decreased intrinsic motivation (Mills & Blankstein, 2000; Miquelon et al., 2005) . One way to alleviate the focus on the self-criticism would be to provide additional scaffolding to help less motivated learners to better contextualize their academic performance (e.g., norm-referenced feedback). The provision of scaffolds based on learners motivational profiles has been addressed in previous studies involving Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning (Rienties et al., 2012) and could be used in studies with learning analytics dashboards to further explore the effects of intrapersonal motivational factors (Lavasani et al., 2014; Rosenzweig & Wigfield, 2016) .",
