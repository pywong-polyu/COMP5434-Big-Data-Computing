            "text": "The Natural Immune System (NIS) is a distributed system that solves challenging search and response problems while operating under constraints imposed by physical space and resource availability. Remarkably, NIS search and response times do not scale appreciably with the physical size of the animal in which its search is conducted. Many distributed systems are engineered to solve analogous problems, and the NIS demonstrates how such engineered systems can achieve desirable scalability. We hypothesize that the architecture of the NIS, composed of a hierarchical decentralized detection network of lymph nodes (LN) facilitates efficient search and response. A sub-modular architecture in which LN numbers and size both scale with organism size is shown to efficiently balance tradeoffs between local antigen detection and global antibody production, leading to nearly scale-invariant detection and response. We characterize the tradeoffs as balancing local and global communication and show that similar tradeoffs exist in distributed systems like LN inspired artificial immune system (AIS) applications and peer-to-peer (P2P) systems. Taking inspiration from the architecture of the NIS, we propose a modular RADAR (Robust Adaptive Decentralized search with Automated Response) strategy for distributed systems. We demonstrate how two existing distributed systems (a LN inspired multi-robot control application and a P2P system) can be improved by a modular RADAR strategy. Such a sub-modular architecture is shown to balance the tradeoffs between local communication (within artificial LNs and P2P clusters) and global communication (between artificial LNs and P2P clusters), leading to efficient search and response.",

Our analysis of data on experimental infection by West Nile Virus (WNV) of a range of animals (from 30g sparrows to 300 kg horses) indicates that the NIS neutralizes WNV in approximately 3 days regardless of body size [2, 3] . This is surprising in the light of two facts: First, the NIS of a horse has to search for a needle (rare antigen) in a much larger haystack (body) than the NIS of a sparrow. Second, experimental data indicates that a critical concentration of WNV-specific antibody needs to be present in the bloodstream to neutralize WNV. Since the volume of blood in an organism is proportional to body mass [4] , a horse will have to produce 10000 times more antibody, in the same time, as a sparrow.",

LNs provide a small volume of tissue in which lymphocytes, antigen-presenting cells and antigen encounter each other. The area of tissue that drains into a LN is called its draining region (DR). Dendritic cells (DCs) sample the tissue in DRs for pathogens, and upon encountering them, migrate to the nearest LN to present antigen to T helper cells. Upon recognizing cognate antigen on DCs, T-cells proliferate and build up a clonal population in a process called clonal expansion. While proliferating, T helper cells also migrate to the LN B-cell area to activate B-cells. B-cells are activated by antigen-bearing DC and T helper cells. After activation, B-cells undergo clonal expansion and differentiate into antibody-secreting plasma cells.",

The rate at which B-cells flow into a particular LN is determined by the cross sectional area of the High Endothelial Venule (HEV) which is proportional to LN volume [5] . Rapid detection requires that pathogens are quickly picked up by DC and carried to the LN for presentation to T-and B-cells. Smaller DR reduce the time for DC to migrate to the LN. Rapid response (in this case we consider antibody production as the response), requires that sufficient numbers of B-cells are activated, ultimately to produce sufficient antibody to neutralize the pathogen. Since both the number of B-cells resident in a LN and the rate at which B-cells are recruited to a LN is proportional to LN volume, larger LN reduce the time to activate a B-cell response.",

Data from elephants (with LN approaching the size of an entire mouse) and horses (with 8000 LN) also support the hypotheses that LN size and number both increase with body size [11, 12] ; however data for more species are required in order to determine scaling exponents that quantitatively describe how LN size and number change with body size. We hypothesize that total LN volume (the number of LN multiplied by average LN volume) is linearly proportional to animal mass because most organ and fluid volumes (i.e heart, blood and liver volume) are linearly proportional to mass [4] . The data are consistent with this hypothesis. This suggests a tradeoff between LN size and number.

There are two potential communication bottlenecks: communication between robots and computer servers, and communication between computer servers. A bottleneck in (local) communication between robot and server demands many small DRs. A bottleneck in (global) server communication requires a few large servers.

SSW keeps the size of a cluster (c) and the number of long-distance links per node (c) constant, even as the number of nodes, n, increases. Our contribution is to modify the system by varying the cluster size and the number of long-distance links per node, analogous to the way that the NIS varies LN size and communication between LN, respectively. We show that there exists a tradeoff between local search time (within a cluster) and global search time (across clusters), and the modular RADAR architecture efficiently balances them. First we vary the number of long-distance connections per node as l = O(log(n/c)). This sets the number of long-distance links per node to the logarithm of the number of clusters (n/c). This is an example of densification [18] in which the number of connections increases slowly with system size in order to minimize the time to send a message to a distant node and also increases robustness. Densification is found empirically in technological networks [18] . The resulting average time for search across clusters is now given by t global = O(log(n/c)). The worst case time taken to propagate a message within a cluster (local search) using neighbour flooding is given by t local = O(c 1/2 ). This reflects the longest message propagation distance (the diagonal) in a lattice of c elements. Thus, the total time to search within and across clusters is given by",

Since we desire a relation for c (cluster size) in terms of n (number of nodes), intuitively we see that the expression containing c (\u03b1 1 c 1/2 \u2212\u03b1 2 logc) must scale at most as the term containing n (\u03b1 2 logn). Otherwise, the expression containing c asymptotically dominates the expression containing n, and T would scale faster than logn. To achieve better than logarithmic scaling with n, we set \u03b1 1 c 1/2 and \u03b1 2 logn equal to each other giving c = O(log 2 n).

However a larger cluster size also increases local search time since there are more nodes. Our architecture balances these tradeoffs and improves the scaling of search time (T ) over prior P2P systems [19] . In addition to achieving rapid search, the modified P2P system is also robust and adaptive. The system is robust to node failures since there is a cluster of size O(log 2 n) leading to increased robustness by redundancy of similar data. Additionally, if search for data residing on a particular node does not succeed due to node failure, data similar to the one being searched for can be supplied by neighbouring semantically clustered nodes. Each node has connections with multiple clusters which leads to more redundant search pathways. The system adapts by having progressively more long-distant connections (l = O(logn)) in order to improve its search characteristics. Such densification properties are also observed in other technological networks (like the World Wide Web, citation networks, and autonomous systems) [18] and arise as an emergent property of these systems. The cluster size also adaptively changes to efficiently balance local and global search performance.",

In the NIS, we considered one scenario in which the pathogen is initially localized in the tissue of a single DR, and the draining LN must recruit additional B-cells from other LN through HEV that deliver blood. However this is one of several scenarios that the IS architecture has evolved. For example, some pathogens propagate immediately through blood and are exposed to multiple LN at once. In such a scenario there is no need for recruitment to a single LN because the pathogen is distributed to multiple LNs. In other scenarios, an infection may stay local, and again there is no need for recruitment. Understanding how the semi-modular architecture of the immune system balances these different scenarios is another area for future work.",

We have shown that such a design balances local antigen detection with global antibody response to minimize total immune response time. As a result, immune response times are nearly scale invariant, in sharp contrast to the vast majority of biological rates that slow systematically as body size increases [24] . We have suggested that modular design principles from the immune system can complement the AIS software approaches to distributed computation, particularly to achieve scalable mobile device control, peer-to-peer networks, and potentially computer security applications.",
