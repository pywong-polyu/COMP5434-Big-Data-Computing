            "text": "Purpose. To explore the relationship between craniomaxillofacial features and psychological distress among adult pretreatment orthodontic patients. Methods. A group of 190 patients (95 males and 95 females) was included. Questionnaires including the Kessler psychological distress scale (K10) were sent to patients, and cephalograms were collected. Patients were divided into two groups according to K10 score: psychological distress group (score \u2265 20) and no psychological distress group (score < 20). Nineteen hard tissue and thirteen soft tissue parameters were traced on cephalograms to characterize the craniomaxillofacial features. Results. There was no significant difference in gender or age distribution between the two groups. Male patients with psychological distress showed statistically significantly larger anterior facial height (AFH) (126.62 mm vs. 120.97 mm), upper lip length (25.11 mm vs. 23.26 mm), and smaller overbite (1.21 mm vs. 2.75 mm) than patients without psychological distress. Male patients with hyperdivergent pattern and open bite were more likely to have psychological distress. None of the parameters showed statistical differences across groups in females. Frankfort-mandibular plane angle (r = 0:235), Bjork's sum (r = 0:311), AFH (r = 0:322), overbite (r = \u22120:238), AFH/posterior facial height (r = 0:251), and upper anterior facial height (UAFH)/lower anterior facial height (LAFH) (r = \u22120:230) were correlated with K10 score in males. After adjusting gender and age, the AFH (B = 0:147) and UAFH/LAFH (B = \u221214:923) were significantly related with the K10 score. Conclusion. Psychological distress was mainly correlated with hyperdivergent pattern, open bite, and larger lower anterior facial height proportion in pretreatment orthodontic patients. Orthodontists should be aware of the possible underlying psychological distress in patients with specific craniomaxillofacial features. Clinical assessment of psychological distress may need to take into account gender differences in patients.",

            "text": "Orthodontic patients with craniomaxillofacial deformities or unattractive dentition are more likely to experience psychological distress due to decreased self-esteem and confidence [1, 2] . Around 44% to 63% of orthodontic patients declare that their facial appearance problems adversely affect their personal or social life [3] . While experiencing a reduction of facial self-perception, patients generally develop higher levels of anxiety, depression, and social isolation [4, 5] . It is of great significance for orthodontists to take these psychological problems into account because patients with high levels of psychological distress might tend to overrate the pain they have experienced, exhibit more negative emotions, be averse to follow-up treatment, and be dissatisfied with the treatment effects [1, 6, 7] . Therefore, evaluation of patients' psychological status can enable orthodontists to identify potential problems and avoid medical disputes at an early stage [8] .",

Due to the influences of self-awareness, family, and society, patients with craniofacial deformities may suffer reduced quality of life and more negative emotions such as anxiety and depression [9, 10] . However, a study by Kovalenko et al. found that only serious facial deformities were associated with mental instability, introversion, and unsociability [11] . Some researchers have even suggested that patients who are dissatisfied with their facial appearance have no special psychological problems [12] . The relationship between craniomaxillofacial morphology and patients' psychological status is still unclear. Moreover, hard tissue and soft tissue structures might affect craniomaxillofacial features and facial aesthetics jointly [13] , and improving facial aesthetics is one of the main purposes of patients pursuing orthodontic treatment [14] . Therefore, it would be more appropriate to evaluate craniomaxillofacial features by considering hard tissue and soft tissue structures together.",

Then, the Bland-Altman analysis was performed for all cephalometric parameters. For each cephalometric 2 Disease Markers parameter, the test-retest difference in cephalometric measurement was plotted against the average difference. Of the thirty two parameters, the first three Bland-Altman plots were demonstrated ( Figure 3 ). Test-retest bias ranged from 0.06 to 0.55. All P values were greater than 0.05, indicating none of the biases calculated was significant. 2.6. Statistical Analysis. The sample size was computed by using G * power (version 3.1.9, Germany) considering \u03b1 = 0:05 and power = 0:80. Based on our previous cross-sectional studies [23] , the mean value for anterior facial height in pretreatment orthodontic patients was 116:07 \u00b1 7:84 mm compared with 120:10 \u00b1 8:92 mm in the control group. We assumed that the sampling ratio (patients with psychological distress/patients without psychological distress) was 0.25 and standard deviation within each group = 7 mm. The analysis revealed that effect size of d was 0.57, and 176 subjects were necessary to perform the study. A total of 190 subjects were included in this study. Data analyses were carried out using SPSS 21.0 software (IBM, New York, USA). Quantitative data are expressed as mean \u00b1 standard deviation, and qualitative data are expressed as quantity and frequency. The Shapiro-Wilk test was used to analyze the normality of age, K10 score, and cephalometric parameters. Nonnormally distributed data (K10 score, age, ANB, wits appraisal, overjet, and facial convexity parameters) between the no-distress and psychological distress groups were analyzed by the Mann-Whitney U test. Normally distributed cephalometric parameters data were analyzed by independent samples t-test. The chi-square test or Fisher test was used to examine the differences in categorical variables (gender and cephalometric parameter stratification) between the two groups. The Spearman correlation analysis was used to correlate K10 score and cephalometric parameters. Correlations were interpreted as follows: weak correlation, r < 0:30; moderate correlation, 0:30 < r < 0:50; and strong correlation, r > 0:50 [24] . And the results of correlation analysis were visualized by scatter plots. The relationship between the K10 score and the cephalometric parameters was determined using multivariate linear regression test, adjusted for gender and age. The dependent variables were K10 score. The P values of independent t-test and correlation analysis were adjusted with the Benjamini and Hochberg method. The test level was \u03b1 = 0:05, and adjusted P values < 0.05 indicated statistically significant differences.",

Therefore, the threshold of K10 score equal to 20 was considered to be appropriate to distinguish between cases and noncases of psychological distress. Using a threshold of 20 to identify cases of psychological distress, our previous study and other studies has found differences in psychological distress among orthodontic patients, TMD patients, and general population [15, 32, 33] .

Meanwhile, there were higher proportions of hyperdivergent patients in the psychologically distressed group, which also confirmed that they had a larger facial height. Some studies suggested that occlusal factors may be a factor in patients' psychological status and that malocclusion can impair patients' oral healthrelated quality of life. In this study, we identified reduced overbite and open bite as specific craniomaxillofacial features in psychologically distressed patients. Psychological discomfort and disability are reported much more frequently among patients with severe malocclusion than in normocclusive people [42, 43] . Limited chewing efficiency and unsatisfactory facial appearance might be the causes of psychological distress in patients with malocclusion [43] . At the same time, other studies have revealed that open bite is related to the degree of FMA [44, 45] , which is in line with 6 Disease Markers the present study. Therefore, we suggest that patients with psychological distress display a trend in both malocclusion and facial height changes. Most previous studies evaluated craniomaxillofacial morphology through self-perception and craniofacial photography, which may compromise the accuracy and stability of the assessment. The measurement tools applied in this study, lateral cephalograms, have been recognized as one of the most reliable and repeatable methods to evaluate dental, skeletal, and soft tissue structures in practice [19, 46] . To the best of our knowledge, we evaluated hard tissue and soft tissue structure together for the first time compared with other similar studies, which made the measurement of craniomaxillofacial features more comprehensive and reliable.",

Female self-perceived facial attractiveness has been related to facial width, periorbital region, and nose ridge area shape, as assessed using 3-dimensional facial surface data or frontal-profile craniofacial photography [49, 50] . Cephalograms do not provide the means to evaluate these facial profile characteristics precisely and therefore 7 Disease Markers may explain why such differences between the two groups were not observed. Another explanation may be that females were divided into two groups by other uncontrolled confounding variables such as dental aesthetics, occlusal function, periodontal or mucosal health status, and psychosocial impacts [2, 51] , which in distressed female patients have much stronger effects. These factors may weakly related to the measured parameters, so the craniomaxillofacial morphological differences cannot be observed. In future study, the strict control of various confounding factors may improve estimations of the psychological effect of craniomaxillofacial features in female patients. Also, facial mor-phological differences may not be the main reason for psychological distress in female patients. The effects that other aspects such as oral function, occlusal stability, and smile aesthetics have on psychological distress status might be given more attention by orthodontists [52, 53] .",

Further research is required to exclude the potential effects of these factors.

Fourth, the selection of the threshold of K10 could affect the stability of the final results. In future studies, using other standard questionnaires concurrently (such as the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7)) might allow better determination of the anxiety and depression of the patients. Fifth, the Bland-Altman plots showed that there might be random errors for the digital tracing.
