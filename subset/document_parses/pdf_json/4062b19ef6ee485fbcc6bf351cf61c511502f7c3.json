One conventional method used for diagnosing infectious diseases is direct isolation of pathogen nucleic acids from biological samples and their detection by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) [9] . Using sequential doubling, PCR exponentially amplifies target templates, providing an opportunity to detect even single copies of pathogenic genomes. Due to its high accuracy and specificity, PCR is used in many biological and medical applications, including diagnosing virtually any human pathogen. However, PCR requires qualified personnel and expensive, highly sophisticated equipment, and often lacks standardized protocols, limiting its implementation in medical care settings. Importantly, PCR-diagnostics is time-consuming and cannot be used for rapid screening of large cohorts. The most recent COVID-19 viral infection was shown to be frequently asymptomatic or without any immediately discernible clinical symptoms, e.g. hyperthermia [10] . Thus, screening of people in crowded places (planes, hospitals etc.) and timely isolation of infected persons cannot be effectively performed with the use of infrared thermography.",

Small clusters of Cas genes, encoding proteins with nucleolytic activity, were frequently found located next to CRISPR repeat-spacer arrays [20] . Many years later, these palindromic repeats and Cas genes were shown to operate as a natural adaptive immune system providing defense against viral infections in bacteria and archaea. CRISPR-Cas function relies on effector Cas proteins and guiding CRISPR RNAs (crRNAs) [21] . CRISPR-Cas systems have been adapted to function in human and other mammalian cells.

Cas9 protein from Streptococcus pyogenes (SpCas9) is the most common choice in gene editing technology due to its highly effective ontarget gene editing. However, frequent off-target activity of SpCas9, defined as cleavage of non-specific DNA genomic sequences similar to the target site, limits its use [14] . Non-specific targeting by Cas9 is based on its ability to tolerate mismatches between the sgRNA and DNA, allowing it to cut even very dissimilar sequences. More specific and clinically safe variants of CRISPR-Cas type II systems are genetically modified or evolved SpCas9 proteins (enhanced SpCas9 or eSpCas9 [32] ; high-fidelity SpCas9-HF1 [33] ; evoCas9 [34] , HypaCas9 [35] , sniper-Cas9 [36] ) and certain orthologous Cas9 proteins from other species [37] [38] [39] [40] . The latter have more restrictive PAM sequences and thus exert fewer potential off-target sites and have intrinsically lower ability to unwind DNA mismatched with the sgRNA [38, 41, 42] . CRISPR-Cas type V systems include several subtypes (V-A, V-B, etc.); Cas12 proteins (Cas12a, Cas12b, etc.) are signature proteins of these systems [43] . Cas12a and Cas12b proteins cut the target sequences leaving sticky ends after DNA cleavage. Cas12a, also known as Cpf1, is often used in gene engineering. CRISPR-Cas type V systems require only the Cas protein and a crRNA to edit the target site. One of the advantages of using Cas12 instead of Cas9 for genetic engineering is its smaller size and lower tolerance of nucleotide mismatches between the target DNA and crRNA [44] . Sticky ends left after Cas12-mediated DNA cleavage are repaired via homologous recombination [45] , a type of low-error repair, thus increasing accuracy of gene editing. More recently, Cas14 proteins, miniature Cas proteins (400-700 aa) of CRISPR-Cas type V systems, have been discovered [46] . Cas14 have been shown to destroy singlestranded DNA without requiring PAM. Some Cas12 and Cas14 proteins possess so-called collateral activity: after binding target DNA, the proteins start destroying any adjacent DNA in a non-specific manner [43] .",

Toehold switch sensors represent programmed synthetic riboregulators able to control translation by binding trigger RNA. Riboregulators carry a hairpin structure that blocks translation in cis by sequestering the ribosome binding site and start codon. When a riboregulator is bound to complementary trigger RNA, the ribosome binding site and start codon are freed and translation is enabled. The RNA target is then amplified by NASBA so that the RNA of interest is reversetranscribed and linked to the riboregulator. NASBA amplification system uses a battery of 3 enzymes: reverse transcriptase, RNase H, and T7 polymerase. In the NASBA method, target RNA is converted into a cDNA-RNA hybrid using specific primers; RNase H then destroys the RNA in this duplex. Next, a primer is added to the reaction mixture to produce synthetic templates recognized by T7 polymerase. The results of the reaction are detected by colorimetry [17] . This technology effectively detects Zika and dengue viruses with the sensitivity of 1-3 fM.",

            "text": "Similarly, the CRISPR-Cas9-triggered exponential amplification reaction (Cas-EXPAR) method combines the advantages of Cas9 to introduce site-specific cuts in target DNA with the isothermal EXPAR method with fluorescent signal detection [61] . Compared to other methods of isothermal amplification, such as NASBA, RCA, SDA, LAMP, or RPA, EXPAR is characterized by relatively high efficacy and speed of product amplification. Until now, EXPAR was not widely used in molecular diagnostics, and was applied mostly for detection of short microRNAs [62] . This limited utility was due to an inherent property of EXPAR that does not allow using extended DNA sequences as primers for amplification. However, CRISPR-Cas9 can be programmed to cut DNA molecules into fragments short enough to successfully implement EXPAR. Wild-type SpCas9 can target and cut only double-stranded DNA molecules, but using the so-called PAM-mers (templates of single-stranded DNA complementary to single-stranded templates with a PAM sequence) permits SpCas9 to recognize and cleave single-stranded RNA or DNA molecules. Reported sensitivity of Cas-EXPAR is ~ 1 amol-10 fmol, and the limit of detection fluctuates around 0.82 amol [61] . These values are comparable to those observed using PCR diagnostics. Due to the high specificity of Cas-EXPAR, this technology can be used to detect methylated DNA after bisulfite conversion, which changes all cytosines in DNA to uracil except for methylated cytosines (5-methylcytosine), which remain intact. Thus, a DNA site with cytosine converted to uracil during bisulfite conversion will not be recognized and cleaved by Cas9 protein when the sgRNA targets the original (non-converted) sequence. As a result, isothermal amplification of such templates by EXPAR proceeds with low efficacy. Conversely, 5-methylcytosine remains intact during bisulfite conversion; sites with 5-methylcytosine can thus be effectively recognized and cut by Cas9, effectively amplified by EXPAR, and detected using conventional fluorescence methods.",

This technology, termed CRISPR-Cas9-mediated lateral flow nucleic acid assay (CASLFA), integrates the CRISPR-Cas9 system with a lateral flow device to detect target dsDNA (Fig. 1) . The target is first amplified using PCR or isothermal amplification methods with biotinylated primers, incubated with CRISPR-Cas9 RNPs and then trickled onto the sample pad. At the surface of the conjugate pad, AuNP-DNA probes bind to a modified the sgRNA scaffold. In this technology, the stem-loop structure of sgRNA is extended by the insertion of additional nucleotides which are recognized by universal AuNPs-DNA probes. Next, biotinylated amplicons complexed with CRISPR-Cas9, flow to the test line and the whole mix gets captured by the streptavidin. This colored signal is visualized at the test line. At the control line, AuNP-DNA probes hybridize with the precoated streptavidin and generate a colored band. In summary, CASLFA is a simple method, consisting of PCR/RPA amplification step with biotinylated primers and a short (3-5 min) lateral flow assay that detects target DNA with high specificity and sensitivity (LOD is \u2248 several gene copies). In conclusion, the authors envision several technical improvements in the CASLFA, such as multiplex detection of different targets by introducing primers with different labels and combination of CALSFA with microfluidic technology on an advanced diagnostic platform.",

The authors demonstrated that Cas12a protein from Lachnospiraceae bacterium ND2006(LbCas12a) exhibits non-specific collateral activity and degrades all adjacent DNA molecules after recognizing target ssDNA or dsDNA. If the reaction with Cas12a protein and targeting crRNA is complemented by single-stranded DNA-reporters (probes) and then mixed with the biological sample, crRNA-dependent recognition of pathogenic nucleic acids by Cas12a turns on collateral activity that destroys DNA probes. DNA probes are designed similarly to conventional TaqMan probes, in which one end of the reporter is bound by a fluorophore and the opposite is linked to a quencher. Degradation of the DNA probes releases fluorophores and results in stable and strong fluorescent signal detected by a fluorimeter. Additionally, DETECTR has been combined with an isothermal pre-amplification step to enrich target sequences (RPA). RPA enhances analytical sensitivity of the diagnostic test and helps to avoid the need for sophisticated and expensive equipment.",

            "text": "The modified HOLMESv2 method uses isothermal amplification of nucleic acids by Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification (LAMP) and recognition of target double-stranded or single-stranded DNA templates by Cas12b protein followed by degradation of single-stranded DNA fluorescent probes by Cas12b collateral activity [66] . Peak collateral activity is reached within 10 min after recognition of target singlestranded DNA molecules by Cas12b, and shifts to 30 min when Cas12b recognizes double-stranded DNA. This property indicates the intricate differences between Cas12b and Cas12a, with the former protein being more active toward double-stranded DNA. Alicyclobacillus acidoterrestrisCas12b (AacCas12b) recognizes and cleaves target doublestranded DNA with adjacent PAM sequence 5\u02b9-TTN-3\u02b9 and exhibits collateral activity [67] . Among target templates with different PAM regions, only double-stranded DNA with PAM 5\u02b9-TTC-3\u02b9 and 5\u02b9-TAC-3\u02b9sequences after cutting activates Cas12b collateral activity and the associated degradation of fluorescent DNA probes, indicating that not all double-stranded DNA sites recognized by Cas12b can effectively turn on collateral activity of the gene-editing protein. Upon binding to singlestranded DNA, collateral activity of Cas12b was shown to be PAMindependent, always activated after interaction with an appropriate target. The lowest concentration of the target single-stranded or doublestranded DNA detected by Cas12b was around 1 nM. Combining Cas12b and LAMP technologies provides specific detection of as little as 0,01 fM DNA, which is equivalent to the sensitivity of Cas12a. HOMLESv2 allows detection of trace amounts of both DNA and RNA as well, if the isolate is reverse transcribed during sample preparation. To reduce the time needed to perform RNA reverse transcription and amplification, the authors proposed using DNA polymerases with 5\u02b9\u21923\u02b9 DNA polymerization and reverse transcriptase activity (e.g., DNA polymerase Bst) [68] .",

            "text": "In 2017, Feng Zhang and colleagues presented SHERLOCK (Fig. 3) , a diagnostic platform based on CRISPR-Cas type VI system [18, 69] . SHERLOCK is based on the same principles as DETECTR, but relies on activity of Cas13 nuclease from Leptotrichia wadei. Cas13 specifically recognizes and cleaves only RNA, rather than DNA like Cas12a, thus non-specifically degrading any neighboring RNA molecules. In vitro transcription of the isolate enables detection of DNA targets. Isothermal amplification RPA can be used to enrich target molecules and increase sensitivity. The amplified RNA fragments are mixed with Cas13 protein crRNA and fluorescent RNA probes. If the target molecules are present in the sample, Cas13 recognizes them via crRNA and indiscriminately cleaves (by collateral activity) fluorescent RNA probes, disrupting the interaction between the fluorophore and the quencher. The presence and intensity of the fluorescent signal thus indicate the amount of the target in the biological sample. The authors demonstrated that SHER-LOCK detects Zika virus, dengue virus, various pathogenic bacteria, and SNPs in DNA with attomolar sensitivity. All components of the SHER-LOCK reaction can be lyophilized and used after long storage periods without impacting the sensitivity and specificity of the test [18] . SHERLOCK had a major drawback: it was qualitative, not quantitative, but a year later, the authors presented the second version of the platform, SHERLOCKv2 (Fig. 3) [70] . SHERLOCKv2 can simultaneously detect targets in 4 different fluorescent channels, because Cas13 proteins from different organisms -LwaCas13a (L. wadei), CcaCas13b (Apnocytophaga canimorsus Cc5), LbaCas13a (L. bacterium[strain NK4A179]), and PsmCas13b (Prevotella sp. MA2016)) -destroy adjacent RNA and DNA molecules preferentially at certain dinucleotide sites (AU, UC, AC, and GA, correspondingly). Generating probes enriched in different dinucleotides and linked to different fluorophores, the authors demonstrated the ability of SHERLOCKv2 to detect up to 4 targets. SHERLOCKv2 also qualitatively evaluates samples with the sensitivity of 2 attomols, optimized to result in strong correlation between signal intensity and concentration of the target. The sensitivity of the signal was dramatically increased over that of SHERLOCK by adding Csm6 protein to the reaction mix. Amplification of the signal becomes possible because collateral activity of LwaCas13a and PsmCas13b destroys RNA, generating hydroxylated 5\u02b9-ends and linear homopolymers of adenine terminating with 2\u02b9,3\u02b9-cyclic phosphates. The latter activates Csm6, which destroys new probe molecules and amplifies the specific signal. By testing Csm6 proteins from many different species, the authors demonstrated that Csm6 from Enterococcus italicus and Lactobacillus salivarius were most efficiently activated by 2\u02b9,3\u02b9-cyclic phosphate ends. Finally, SHERLOCKv2 was engineered to produce a visual colorimetric readout on commercial lateral flow strips that do not require any special equipment. In this setting, the presence of the target is determined by visually inspecting the strips with different intensity of staining. The entire SHERLOCKv2 reaction is performed in a single step by directly applying the biological sample to the test strip without purifying and isolating nucleic acids. To conclude, SHERLOCKv2 is a highly sensitive quantitative diagnostic platform suitable for multiplex signal detection and visual/colorimetric detection on lateral flow strips [70] .",

One pot assay was possible using a thermostable Alicyclobacillus acidiphilus (AapCas12b) which can reportedly function at temperatures up to 65\u2103. However, AapCas12b did not perform well in one pot assays at 55 \u2103 and higher. Joung with coauthors screened 94 additives and identified that addition of taurine improves reaction kinetics. This protocol is called SHERLOCK testing in one pot (STOP) and is optimized for SARS-CoV-2 detection (STOPCovid). The test can be performed at single temperature (60 \u2103) within an hour. Sensitivity of STOPCovid outperforms CDC RT-qPCR test with the limit of detection (LOD) \u224833 copies of RNA per mL.

CRISPR-Cas12a-mediated interfacial cleaving of hairpin DNA reporter for electrochemical nucleic acid sensing [83] test uses immobilized interfacial hairpin DNA (hpDNA) electrochemical reporters which are cleaved by Cas12a upon recognition of the target DNA. HpDNA cleavage changes electrochemical properties of the biosensor resulting in a strong and specific signal. Compared to E-CRISPR, which uses a conventional linear ssDNA reporter as a sensing interface, hpDNA has an increased accessibility to Cas12a nucleases which dramatically improves electrochemical response change and analytical sensitivity of the method. As low as 30 pM of unamplified target DNA can be detected in \u224860 min.",

The authors managed to increase Cas13a activation and fluorescence intensity by combining multiple crRNAs for the target and by measuring fluorescence over time instead of the endpoint fluorescence. Combination of 2-3 crRNAs enables detection of as few as 30 copies/\u03bcL of target SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Applying several crRNAs also ensures specificity of the method and increases the chances to detect mutated RNA molecules. This assay uses a mobile phone camera with a low-cost laser illumination and collection of optics to detect the fluorescent signal and, most importantly, directly translates fluorescent signal into viral loads. Among the work required to introduce this test into the practice, it is necessary to introduce an extraction-free protocol, minimize the number of steps, improve sensitivity with optimized CRISPR-Cas components and reaction mixtures and, possibly, develop an embedded sensor that wirelessly sends the results to a mobile phone.",

[70, 96] , became the first CRISPR-test admitted to the clinical use. It includes three steps, namely (1) [97] . Before reaction, target RNA molecules are pre-amplified by isothermal RT-LAMP amplification. Comparison of CDC qRT-PCR assay and DETECTR lateral flow assay demonstrated that PCR-based method has an analytic performance of 1 copy per \u00b5l, whereas for DETECTR it values to 10 copies per \u00b5l. Falsenegative samples were possible in viral titers below the limit of detection for DETECTR. Concordance between DETECTR and PCR detection of SARS-CoV-2 was 95-100%. Similarly, Lucia et al., presented the results on rapid, ultrasensitive and portable detection of SARS-CoV-2 using LbCa12a-based method combined with RPA isothermal preamplification [98] . The parameters of the detection system reported by Lucia et al. [98] , are comparable with DETECTR-based CRISPR method [97] . CARMEN-Cas13 was shown to be rapidly re-directed for clinically-relevant purposes [95] . As such, a new test to detect SARS-CoV-2 was rapidly incorporated into CARMEN-Cas13 platform, allowing analysis of > 400 samples per chip. Overall, CRISPR-Cas detection systems can benefit a lot when combined with highly-multiplexed and high-throughput CARMEN technology.",

Very encouraging results demonstrating specificity and sensitivity of assays similar to PCR should be tested in real-world situations. Many modifications to existing assays may be introduced to increase sensitivity of the tests and time required to perform diagnostic tests. Moreover, specificity of CRISPR diagnostics may also be a concern, as Cas proteins can tolerate nucleotide mismatches and recognize non-specific templates, compromising assay validity.

Large-scale testing and comparative analysis of different PCRbased and CRISPR diagnostic systems in the real world is mandatory to move new methods into laboratory and field diagnostics. Introducing CRISPR diagnostic tools into practice may improve control over infectious diseases, prevent their rapid spread, introduce diagnostic testing to finally enter the era of precise and personalized medicine [99] , expand the use of massive population screening, and better control outbreaks of infectious diseases, including outbreaks in remote geographic areas. Timely, inexpensive, high-quality diagnosis of infectious and non- infectious diseases by rapid and readily available tests will certainly have a pronounced positive impact on human health on the global level, reducing morbidity and mortality. Amplification of nucleic acids by PCR, the central dogma of molecular diagnostics, has long been the only practical way to detect trace amounts of infectious pathogens in biological samples. PCR analysis requires expensive equipment and qualified personnel to run the tests and interpret the results. Many attempts have been undertaken in the past years to avoid PCR cycling and adopt amplification to isothermal conditions. However, all other methods (NASBA, LAMP, RPA, HAD) [100] suffered from serious flaws compromising their utility in molecular diagnostics; these flaws included low sensitivity, low specificity, complicated reactions, and high price. Embedding methods of isothermal amplification into CRISPR diagnostic platforms eliminates the shortcomings of both technologies, achieving rapid and highly specific results. Compared to PCR, SHERLOCK/SHERLOCKv2 and DETECTR add another level of specificity because these methods not only use specific primers during isothermal amplification, but also specifically recognize target templates via Cas-sg/crRNA complex.",

PCR is very sensitive to mismatched nucleotides at the 3\u02b9-end of primers, which dramatically reduces non-specific primer annealing and ensures accurate target amplification [101] . CRISPR proteins recognize and bind degenerate sequences with multiple mismatches, depending on the nature of the CRISPR protein. On the one hand, this property may compromise the validity of diagnostic tests, leading to false positive results. On the other, ignoring nucleotide mismatches allows CRISPR proteins to recognize naturally variable genetic sequences. For instance, this property may facilitate effective detection of genetically distinct mutant HIV genomes, hepatitis C genomes, etc. Notably, SHERLOCKv2 can avoid isothermal amplification [70] . The specific signal is amplified by a combination of Cas13a proteins and coactivating Csm6 proteins, which react to cyclic oligonucleotides generated after specific cleavage of the target. Important properties of CRISPR diagnostics are simplicity, stability of components, no requirement for isolation of nucleic acids from biological samples (in the most advanced technologies), and isothermal conditions of each step, requiring minimal equipment.",

Dengue fever symptoms resemble those of hemorrhagic fevers caused by Ebola virus and other viruses [118] . Thus, laboratory diagnosis of dengue fever is crucial for rapid management of patients with severe infection [119] . Dengue infection can be confirmed by isolating the virus and immunologically detecting viral protein Ns1 [120] . Real-time PCR analysis is widely used for Ebola virus diagnostics, but expensive equipment and well-trained personnel are required to obtain accurate results [121] . Most importantly, the situation in the areas of outbreaks requires urgent action to identify infected persons and curb disease spread. In this respect, PCR technologies are inferior to CRISPR-tools in terms of time required to get the results and that they cannot be readily deployable for field diagnostics, especially in remote areas. Developing new diagnostic tools will hopefully help to prevent further spread of infection and better inform patient treatment. The CRISPR based detection system NASBACC [17] can detect dengue virus, but SHERLOCKv2 [70] is the most sensitive system that differentiates the four viral serotypes with high efficacy.",

            "text": "Coronaviral infections represent a daunting threat to the global health, appearing every 10-20 years with new outbreaks, diseasing thousands of people with relatively high death toll. The first case of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) has been documented in November 2002 in Foshan, China [123] . During four months the disease spread into 27 countries, and a total of 8,096 cases were identified [124] . Since the outbreak, only the sporadic cases were reported. Bats are known to be a natural reservoir for a wide range of coronaviruses, but human-bat interactions are relatively rare, so an intermediate host is thought to be required to infect humans. However, it has been recently demonstrated that coronaviruses directly isolated from bats are able to infect human cells without prior adaptation [125, 126] . These data indicate that novel infections can emerge potentially leading to widespread outbreaks [5] . Middle East respiratory syndrome virus (MERS-CoV) was isolated from sputum of a man who died of acute pneumonia and renal failure in 2012 [127] . By April 2016, MERS has been detected in 27 countries, and 1,728 infection cases were confirmed [128] . MERS-CoV-like viruses are shown to inhabit dromedary camels [5, 129] . Thus, MERS-CoV zoonotic transmission is not rare, and MERS-CoV continues to infect humans due to the fact that dromedary camel are farmed and are in close proximity to humans [5] .Both SARS and MERS viruses have high risk of nosocomial transmission [130, 131] and were spread from the initial outbreak location by infected individuals [132] [133] [134] [135] . PCR assays have been developed for SARS and MERS CoVs detection [136, 137] . New human Coronavirus infection emerged in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, and currently it is an ongoing outbreak that spread through the mainland of China and neighboring countries [6] . The first cases of novel coronavirus infection were reported in a fresh seafood market which distributed various mammals and exotic wildlife animals, including bats, snakes, rats, beavers etc. Such areas of crowded people, exotic wildlife and low-quality sanitary conditions represent high-risk places for emerging of novel zoonotic infections. The symptoms of the novel viral infection were identified as fever, dry cough, headache and pneumonia, altered sense of smell or taste (anosmia or hyposmia) [138] [139] [140] [141] . The infectious agent was identified as Coronavirus, designated SARS-CoV-2. At the current time, the pandemic of SARS-CoV-2 infection has already infected > 120 millions people worldwide [142] .",

            "text": "Clinical features of pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV-2 were described shortly after the outbreak. Full-genome sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 revealed that it belongs to group 2B of the Betacoronaviridae family, possessing 70% similarity to SARS-CoV. The source of the virus still remains a matter of debate, although an initial report suggested snakes or pangolins as possible intermediate hosts [148, 149] . Nevertheless, another scientific group reported that virus potentially has a bat origin [150] . Due to the rapid spread of the virus, express diagnostics is essential for reducing the risk of further transmission. CRISPR based diagnostic tests would be helpful for effective identification, diagnosis and management of the infection. Since the outbreak and sequencing of the virus, a plethora of PCR-systems for detecting the pathogen were developed. However, PCR does not fit the relevant needs to control and curb the emerging outbreaks, as is noted throughout the review. The ideal tool would have been an express-method to unequivocally detect the pathogen and identified infected persons. Although the field of CRISPR-diagnostics is at the early stage of development, further advancement of such tests in the express-format holds a lot of promise both in the daily practice (point-of-care tests) and in epidemiological surveillance programs to prevent disease spread. While this manuscript was in preparation, several CRISPR-based methods for rapid and specific detection of SARS-CoV-2 were developed [97, 98] . The SHERLOCKv2 platform was for the first time approved for use by FDA [96] . The results of the first pilot study of SHERLOCK CRISPR SARS-CoV-2 test kit demonstrated accurate detection of the presense or absence of the SARS-CoV-2 in clinical samples. The results of SHERLOCK CRISPR SARS-CoV-2 test kit were 100% concordant with those of PCR test [151] .",

In 2020, the first CRISPR diagnostic system (Sherlock\u2122 CRISPR SARS-CoV-2 kit) received FDA emergency use authorization in the United States for SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis. Numerous obstacles may still hamper rapid translation of laboratory results into practice, including off-target recognition and potential false-positive results associated with the intricate property of CRISPR proteins to tolerate mismatched nucleotides, but the early results demonstrate that CRISPR-diagnostics are starting to conquer their place in modern health care system. Designing software-backed optimal sgRNAs with minimal potential off-target effects (e.g., CHOPCHOP [152] ), and identifying or inventing novel CRISPR proteins with more practical properties or limited mismatch tolerance may solve this potential problem. Cas proteins can currently be adjusted by, for instance, direct evolution to change PAM sequence requirements (shorter/longer PAMs or PAMs with certain nucleotide preferences [38, 41] ) or higher specificity (e.g., enSpCas9 [32] ). Sg/ crRNAs have also undergone many modifications, starting from shortened sg/crRNAs [153] to sg/crRNAs with engineered RNA hairpins [154] . Predicting and identifying novel CRISPR systems is currently the hottest topic in biology. One of the many examples of successful identification of CRISPR proteins with previously unknown properties is Cas13a (previously referred to as C2c2), which has transformed into a powerful molecular tool [18] . Application of CRISPR may go far beyond detection of nucleic acids or identification of clinically-relevant mutations, as several CRISPR technologies have been devised to identify proteins [80] and could be utilized for detecting small molecules [155] (e.g. toxic agents, opioids, drugs etc.). Practically, they may transform into new, more efficient and cheap approaches that could replace many conventional techniques, such as immunosorbent assays, chromatography etc.",

It is also unclear what types of the samples could be used for CRISPRdiagnostics, such as dry blood spot cards etc. Automation and highthroughput use of CRISPR-screening has just recently been addressed in a novel CARMEN-Cas13 technology, providing exciting results [95] . Optimization and simplification of the CRISPR-diagnostic procedure is also the key for their successful introduction into the practice. Eliminating an amplification step without substantially affecting sensitivity of the CRISPR-diagnostic system is important not only in terms of time, but also to reduce the risks of amplification bias and cross-contamination of the samples. In this respect, many technologies succeeded to minimize potential contamination issues by introducing one pot procedures (OR-DETECTR/OR-SHERLOCK, SHINE, AIOD) with thermostable Cas proteins or by using amplification-free strategies (E-CRISPR, ultralocalized assay, optimized assay with several crRNAs etc.). It is important that these simplified procedures also ensure minimal sample loss as they do not require several washing and pipetting steps. The majority of the currently developed CRISPR-diagnostic tests does not address the issue of multiplex detection (simultaneous detection of several targets), quantitative detection and unbiased interpretation of the results. Most importantly, CRISPR-diagnostics may provide the means for rapid, express-diagnostics, but the time currently required for performing the CRISPR-mediated identification of target nucleic acids is still far from being considered an \u00abexpress method\u00bb.",

The lateral flow device consists of a sample pad where the isolate is applied, a conjugate pad with pre-assembled AuNP-DNA probes, a test line and a control line. At the test line, complexes of CRISPR-Cas with the target biotinylated DNA and AuNP-DNA probes, hybridized with the stem-loop region of sgRNA, interact with pre-coated streptavidin at the test pad to produce a visible signal. At the same time, AuNP-DNA probes move further and interact with streptavidin at the control line. AuNP-DNA probes contain three regions, namely (1) polyA-polyT (poly A used for labeling with Au and polyT as a linker); (2) purple area for hybridization with the embedded probe in the control line and (3) yellow area used for hybridization with the engineered stem-loop region in sgRNA. (B) Schematics of CASLFA procedure. Isolated DNA is amplified with biotinylated primers using RPA or PCR.
