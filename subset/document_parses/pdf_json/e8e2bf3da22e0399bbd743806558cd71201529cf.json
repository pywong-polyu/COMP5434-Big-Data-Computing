            "text": "During coronavirus exposure, most individuals have an effective initial immune response, which eliminates the virus or leads to a subclinical infection with no symptoms or mild symptoms. In a few cases, viral evasion of the immune response can lead to refractory alveolar damage, ineffective lung repair mechanisms, and systemic hyper-inflammation with associated organ dysfunction worsening the patient's outcome . The immune response in these patients is highly variable and can include moderate to severe systemic inflammation or marked systemic immune suppression. Lately, several studies have suggested that an immunophenotype-driven approach such as anti-cytokine therapy or switching the proinflammatory stage to an immunoregulatory phenotype would help to succeed in treating patients with critical illness due to COVID-19. Although blocking antibodies therapy has been clinically tested and has shown promising results, the use of immunomodulators could improve the outcome. studies revealed that the SARS-CoV spread from bats to palm civets and subsequently to humans, probably originated through the selection and mutation of the SARS-like animal virus, which finally allowed human-to-human transmission (Halaji et al. 2020 ). Ten years later, in September 2012 arose the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus named MERS-CoV. The first report was in Saudi Arabia and all cases were established in the Middle East and North Africa region, Europe, East Asia, and the United States (Ramadan and Shaib 2019) . The origin of this virus is not fully understood, but the evidence suggests bats as the primary host and then subsequent transmission to camels and humans. In 2012, MERS-CoV infected nearly 900 persons with 334 deaths resulting in a mortality rate of 35% (Halaji et al. 2020) . To date, the World Health Organization (WHO) has notified 2,279 cases and 732 fatalities in 27 countries, thus MERS-CoV is by far the less contagious coronavirus, but it is the most fatal (Ramadan and Shaib 2019) . The current pandemic is caused by a new emerging virus denominated Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) for its high similarity to SARS-CoV. This outbreak started in early December 2019 in Wuhan, China. In January 2020, the WHO announced a Public Health Emergency of International Concern, and finally, in March 2020 the WHO declared the disease COVID-19 as a pandemic. One year after, there are more than 100 million cases and more than 2 million deaths in at least 216 countries (Ganesh et al. 2021) .",

Even though the scenery was not good, there was a history of previous coronavirus outbreaks, which allowed us a start, not from zero. Similar drugs that were used in previous pandemics began to be used and special attention was paid to the spike protein as a therapeutic target, in addition to using the artillery used to treat other types of RNA viruses (Khan et al. 2020) . Several studies have suggested the use of interferon (IFN)-\u03b1, ribavirin combined with IFN-\u03b1 or lopinavir/ritonavir, chloroquine phosphate, nelfinavir, and arbidol (Wolfel et al. 2020) . Other antiviral drugs have been tested during this pandemic (reviewed comprehensively elsewhere) (Peng et al. 2021; Ratre et al. 2021) , as well as the use of immunotherapy such as convalescent plasma from recovered patients, intravenous injection of an anti-SARS-CoV-2 human immunoglobulin, and tocilizumab, all of them accompanied by the use of glucocorticoids such as methylprednisolone to damper inflammation, thus allowing better oxygenation. Preventing complications and providing organ function support are also key therapeutic approaches; nevertheless, no specific antiviral treatment of COVID-19 still exists. In the last months, several vaccines have emerged against the COVID-19, these vaccines came through because of the general global effort, a few candidates are in phase three and they are being used for the vaccination of susceptible groups, all of them with promissory results, many other candidates are in developing phases (WHO 2021) . The development of these vaccines took about a year and during this time, clinical practitioners have been struggling with the COVID-19, using the drugs they have in their hands to save as many lives as they can. Therefore, we must have new alternatives for the next pandemic, which will happen undoubtedly, the question is when. There is no doubt that in that scenario, we will have the experience from this pandemic and some drugs ready to be used, of course, a new vaccine will be developed, but in the meantime, it will be necessary to provide pharmaceutical alternatives.",

Several mechanisms are related to the response of HDPs during IAV infection. For instance, the human neutrophil peptide (HNP)-1, which belongs to the \u03b1-defensins family, has shown the ability to inactivate IAV through 25 Page 4 of 12 direct binding to the virus, giving place to the formation of a complex, therefore preventing the entry of the virus into host cells and promoting phagocytosis (Daher et al. 1986 ). But also, there is evidence that HNP-1 inhibits protein kinase C activation in infected cells, which is required for viral replication and viral protein synthesis (Salvatore et al. 2007 ). Besides, HNPs were described as IAV viral particle aggregation inducers, facilitating their uptake by neutrophils (Tecle et al. 2007 ). Regarding human defensins (HD)-5 and HD-6, they both have similar activity as shown by HNP-1 against IAV but with lesser affinity (Doss et al. 2009 ). The IAV infection in plasmacytoid dendritic cells (DCs) and monocytes induced an early expression of human \u03b2-defensin (HBD)-1 and decreased viral replication, which suggests HBD-1 plays a protective role (Ryan et al. 2011) . Besides, HBD-3 prevents the IAV fusion with the host cells by binding the viral glycoprotein hemagglutinin in a dose-dependent manner (Leikina et al. 2005 ).",

Further, the LL-37 immunomodulatory properties are related to lesser disease severity since LL-37 treatment induces less secretion of proinflammatory cytokines in the lung (Barlow et al. 2011). Human adenoviruses (HAdVs) are non-enveloped DNA viruses capable of infecting several systems, including the respiratory system, and frequently caused severe fatal disseminated infections in immunocompromised patients (Smith and Nemerow 2008) . Both HNP-1 and HBD-2 are released by polymorphonuclear cells, reducing adenoviral infection in a dose-dependent manner (Bastian and Schafer 2001) . Likewise, HD-5 and HBD-1 protect host cells from adenoviral infections (Gropp et al. 1999 ). These peptides bind to the viral capsid thus preventing viral uncoating and disabling it to penetrate cellular endosomes, which in turn hamper the adenovirus particles to spread, triggering a virion accumulation in early endosomes and lysosomes instead of their traffic to the nucleus (Nguyen et al. 2010; Smith and Nemerow 2008) . To note, the correct peptidefolding and its net charge allow viral neutralization by binding to critical HAdV sites (Gounder et al. 2012; Smith et al. 2010) . Less information exists regarding LL-37 effectiveness in HAdV infections. LL-37 exerts a rapid viral inactivation and the mechanism proposed is through the adenoviral particle disruption (Gordon et al. 2005) . Nevertheless, this effect has only been observed in HAdV, probably because of their structural viral differences (Uchio et al. 2013) .",

            "text": "To date, scarce information has been generated regarding the role of HDPs in response to the coronavirus infection, indeed, it is unknown whether the efficient production of these HDPs leads to the elimination of the coronavirus, causing mild or no symptomatology at all or if the low production or lack of HDPs could be associated with severe symptoms. The results generated from several studies in this context allow us to propose a new hypothesis of the possible role of these peptides. For instance, using molecular dynamic simulation, researchers determined that \u03b1-defensin-5 can block ACE-2 in the human intestinal epithelium, which was reflected in inhibiting the entry of SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirions to cells at concentrations as low as 10 \u03bcg/mL . Similarly, previous studies have shown that \u03b1 defensins play an important role in preventing viral entry into host cells and in the transmission of viral infection among cells (Wilson et al. 2017) . Previous studies reported that \u03b1-defensin levels were elevated in patients with COVID-19, suggesting this defensin as a therapeutic target (Kerget et al. 2021 ). Other studies have demonstrated that \u03b2-defensins-derivative peptides exhibited potent and broad-spectrum antiviral effects on multiple respiratory viruses such as influenza A virus H1N1, H3N2, H5N1, H7N7, H7N9, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV. This antiviral activity was related to their high affinity to viral glycoproteins; they also prevent endosomal acidification by blocking membrane fusion and subsequent viral RNA release (Zhao et al. 2016) . Similar studies in MERS-CoV infection showed that the conjugation of HBD-2 to spike protein receptor-binding domain induces antigen-specific protective immunity, thus suggesting that HBD-2 potentiates immune responses against the viral antigen and could be used as an adjuvant to enhance the immunogenicity of subunit vaccine candidates against MERS-CoV (Kim et al. 2020 ). Other approaches have emphasized the importance of HDPs to promote antiviral-related-immunity limiting viral proliferation in SARS-CoV-infected mice. The experimental use of defensins displayed significant reductions in levels of RANTES, IL-1\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, keratinocyte chemoattractant, MIP1\u03b1, monocyte chemoattractant protein 1, and IL-12 (p40), whereas the viral-control-related cytokines were increased (Wohlford-Lenane et al. 2009 ). Similar Thus, immunization with S-RBD-HBD-2 leads to a protective immune response against MERS-CoV and could be used as an approach for vaccine development (Kim et al. 2018 (Kim et al. , 2019 (Kim et al. , 2020 . Moreover, the HD-5 structure allows interaction with the SARS-CoV-2 receptor, ACE-2, even with a higher affinity than the virus itself. HD-5 hides amino acids crucial for the ACE-2 recognition by the S protein and hence, HD-5 competes with the virus inhibiting its entry to host cells . These results agree with a study where patients with COVID-19 showed reduced expression levels of defensins, such as HBD4A, HBD106B, HBD107B, HBD103A, and HD1B in the nasopharyngeal cavity (Idris et al. 2020) . Thus, suggesting that insufficient production of defensins allows progressive disease and it is also proposed the use of an HD-5 aerosol before potential exposure to SARS-CoV-2 as a preventive measure (Niv 2020). (4) HAdV, HRVs, and IAV promote LL-37 expression; moreover, HRVs also induce human beta-defensin (HBD)-3, and IAV induce HBD-1 and human neutrophil peptide (HNP)-1 as well. (5) Some HDPs have direct virucidal effects. LL-37 can damage HAdV, HRVs, and IAV virions. Also, HBD-3 shows cytotoxic activity against HRVs. (6) Other HDPs have virucidal indirect effects. HNP-1 binds to HA protein, avoiding the IAV infection, but it also binds directly to the virus promoting its aggregation and inactivation. Besides HNP-1 inhibits protein C kinase (PKC) in infected cells, which is necessary for viral replication. To note, HD-5 and -6 have similar effects but with lesser potency. (7) In infected cells, HD-5 and HBD-2 bind directly to HAdV preventing its uncoating and promoting its accumulation in endosomes to avoid viral replication 25",

            "text": "Although the proinflammatory activity of HDPs has been widely described in the past decade, several findings have demonstrated that HDPs under certain conditions selectively act as anti-inflammatory molecules. Indeed, some HDPs are balanced toward anti-inflammatory activity, such as the case for LL-37. Administration of exogenous LL-37 decreased tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1) and interleukin (IL)-17 while inducing anti-inflammatory IL-10 and transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03b2 production in Mycobacterium tuberculosisinfected macrophages, whereas in uninfected macrophages promoted a proinflammatory profile (Torres-Juarez et al. 2015) . This cathelicidin is also capable of inhibiting neutrophil chemotaxis, inducing the internalization of the CXCR2 (Zhang et al. 2009 ) and promoting non-inflammatory necrosis, thus controlling excessive inflammation (Li et al. 2009 ). Another anti-inflammatory mechanism described for LL-37 is that this peptide modulates the TLR-to-NF\u03baB pathway contributing to the local regulation of inflammation, furthermore, LL-37 promotes the production of IL-1-soluble receptor, whereas induces the expression of anti-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-10 and TGF-\u03b2 (Hemshekhar et al. 2018; Mookherjee et al. 2006 Mookherjee et al. , 2009 Torres-Juarez et al. 2015) . Interestingly, other molecular mechanisms are involved with the capacity of LL-37 to inhibit the Th1 immune responses produced in response to IFN-\u03b3 by suppressing the production of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-12 in monocytes, macrophages, and DCs, as well as inhibiting the activation of class-switching in splenic B cells, these inhibitory effects are merely mediated through suppression of STAT1-independent-signaling pathway (Nijnik et al. 2009 ). KR-12 is a short fragment from LL-37 corresponding to residues 18-29 and exhibits antimicrobial activity and important anti-inflammatory activity, indeed, alleviates inflammation in colitis models, this suggests that KR-12 is worth being considered as a potential therapeutic, nonetheless, the mechanism to reduce inflammation has not been elucidated (Fabisiak et al. 2021) . Similar studies have reported that LL-37 restored glucocorticoid sensitivity impaired by dsRNA, possibly by inhibiting the Akt pathway, in addition to Erk1/2 pathway. These findings suggest LL-37 as a therapeutic agent for treating viral infections in inflammatory pulmonary diseases . While LL-37 and its derivatives have shown clear evidence to modulate the immune response, other HDPs have similar functions and can even act synergically. The HBD-3 has recently been associated with anti-inflammation, this defensin can attenuate the production of IL-6, IL-10, GM-CSF, and TNF-\u03b1 response of human myeloid DCs (Pingel et al. 2008) . Other studies showed that in tuberculosis patients the concentration of cortisol correlates positively with the levels of HBD-3, which strongly suggests its relation in anti-inflammatory processes (Bongiovanni et al. 2020 ). In the same line, HBD-3 can polarize macrophages into M2 phenotype contributing to an anti-inflammatory environment (Lyu et al. 2017) . HBD-3 also is a potent inhibitor of the accumulation of proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6, both in vivo and in vitro; overall, these studies suggest a role of HBD-3 in the resolution of inflammation, which is necessary to avoid tissue damage by effectors of antimicrobial action and cytokine storm (Semple et al. 2010 ). On the other hand, \u03b1-defensin (HNP-1) blocked the release of IL-1\u03b2 from LPS-activated monocytes, but not the expression and release of TNF-\u03b1 (Shi et al. 2007 ).",

This peptide has 36 amino acids with a conserved region called HR2 (C-terminal heptad repeat), which disrupts the HIV-1 molecular machinery at the final stage of fusion with the target cell, preventing uninfected cells from becoming infected. Enfuvirtide was designed to mimic components of the HIV-1 fusion machinery and displace them, is often used for treating patients that do not respond to retroviral therapy (Poveda et al. 2005) . Sifuvirtide has 36 amino acids in length and shares some sequence and structure properties with the native CHR peptide of HIV-1 gp41 glycoprotein. In comparison with T-20, it has 22 different amino acids residues. It has an increased half-life than T-20 and is highly effective against T-20-resistant strains. The use of sifuvirtide is still in phase III clinical trials in China (He et al. 2008) , interestingly, sifuvirtideresistant strains have already been characterized and mechanisms underlying this resistance have been described (Yu et al. 2018) .",

These drugs are evidence for the use of synthetic peptides that provide a predictive mechanism of action. Similarly, brilacidin is peptidomimetic, with non-peptidic scaffolds and side chains, which has structural and biological properties similar to HDPs, it has been tested in phase II for skin acute bacterial infection, ulcerative proctitis, and viral infections. Recently, this peptidomimetic has been evaluated in a human lung cell line and Vero cells. These results suggest that SARS-CoV-2 inhibition in these cell culture models is likely to be a result of the impact of brilacidin on viral entry and its disruption of viral integrity (Bakovic et al. 2021 ). The polypeptide aprotinin from bovine lung is a broadrange inhibitor of serine proteases that exhibits antimicrobial activity against different microorganisms. The safety and efficacy of aprotinin were shown in clinical trials (Sch\u00fctz et al. 2020) , and now the aprotinin has been experimentally used in Calu-3 human airway epithelial cells infected with SARS-CoV2 showing considerable therapeutic potential for the treatment of COVID-19 (Bestle et al. 2020) . Indeed, aprotinin inhibited SARS-CoV-2 replication in therapeutically achievable concentrations. An analysis of proteomics and translatome data indicated that SARS-CoV-2 replication is associated with a downregulation of host cell protease inhibitors; thus, aprotinin may interfere with SARS-CoV-2-mediated downregulation of host cell protease inhibitors during later virus replication cycles (Bojkova et al. 2020) . As an anti-influenzal compound, aprotinin used as small-particle aerosol has been approved in Russia for local respiratory application in mild-to-moderate influenza to provide both an antiviral effect and a decrease in systemic pathology and inflammation (Zhirnov et al. 2011 ). Regardless, the use of aprotinin in clinics for coronavirus infections deserves further investigation.",

Data revealed that lactoferrin interacts with heparan sulfate proteoglycans and ACE-2 receptors that are reported as SARS-CoV-2-binding sites to enter the host cell, suggesting a potential significance of lactoferrin as an antiviral against SARS-CoV-2 (Fig. 2) .

In theory, this model could contribute explaining the first cause of death by COVID-19: acute respiratory failure due to the self-immune disruption of the lung cells; therefore, the reestablishment of lipid composition or even the blockage of specific HDPs involved in the destruction of host cells could be considered as possible therapeutic intervention point (Garcia-Fandino and Pineiro 2021). The design and use of HDPs and peptidederived therapeutics must be focused on those with antiinflammatory and specific anti-viral activity. Besides, it will be necessary to determine specifically what HDPs are involved in the immunopathogenesis of COVID-19 to specifically block those detrimental peptides.",

Since the immunopathology of Coronavirus-related diseases is most inflammatory, the use of antimicrobial peptides and their derivatives as therapeutics must be deeply evaluated and research should be focused on those candidates with markedly anti-inflammatory effects and prominent antiviral activity, as described above. There are several candidates and many more will emerge using bioinformatic designing choosing or modeling the ideal HDPs. We should not forget the lessons learned from this pandemic and we should be prepared well in advance, planning appropriate preventive measures for the next wave of the outbreak of coronavirus in the future; thus, the question should not be whether or not there will be another pandemic, the correct question is when it will happen, by then, we should have a long list of candidates ready to be used.

Then, chemokines promote leukocyte recruitment, suggesting the induction of an effective adaptive response(Kim et al. 2018). Hence, S-RBD-HBD-2 promotes the expression of Nod2 and IFN-I through the activation of the transcription factor IRF3 to set up an antiviral cell state. Besides, HBD-2 induces the expression of M1 macrophage markers which are associated with antigenic presentation and antibody production(Kim et al. 2019).",
