            "text": "In the COVID-19 pandemic period, nursing students have been among the groups that experienced the most difficulties due to their practical lessons being held in hospitals [13] . When the literature is examined, there are studies on distance education of nursing students during the COVID-19 pandemic [14] [15] [16] , their mental health [17] , perceived stress, views on COVID-19 [18] , anxiety levels, perspectives on the nursing profession [19] , emotional responses and coping strategies [20, 21] , and preventive, traditional, and complementary medicine practices against COVID-19 [22] . There are a limited number of qualitative studies examining the experiences of student nurses during the pandemic process and their feelings and thoughts about the pandemic process. In one of these qualitative studies, the tweets of student nurses on social media were examined. It was stated that students tweeted about reactions to the COVID-19 pandemic, daily life, student role, social connections, and sociopolitical issues [23] . In other studies, how student nurses perceive COVID-19, their experiences in this process [24] , the difficulties they encounter during distance education [25, 26] , and the experiences of senior nursing students who joined the health care workforce during the pandemic process were examined [27] . In our study, unlike other studies, first-year nursing students who have not yet experienced professional practice were asked to keep a diary between specific dates during the pandemic process, and their experiences in this process were examined. It is thought that the interruption of education, the transition to the distance education, the uncertainty experienced, the interruption of clinical practices, and their first encounter with the pandemic have negatively affected the students who are still in the process of adapting to the profession and the university. It is thought that revealing the experiences of nursing students, who will have important roles in healthcare practices in the future, during the pandemic, will make a significant contribution to handling the possible effects of the pandemic on the students, the management of the difficulties that may occur after the pandemic, and the appropriate interventions. This study was conducted to identify the experiences of first-year nursing students studying at the Faculty of Nursing of a university in Turkey during the first month of social restrictions of the COVID-19 pandemic.",

Between 3-30 April 2020 is the first month of social restrictions in our country. In particular, we wondered what the students who had not yet taken vocational courses were experiencing during the first month of social restrictions of the COVID-19 pandemic. For this reason, first-year students were determined as the population of the study, as they had not yet taken practical courses specific to the profession and had no hospital experience. The sample group consisted of 47 students who volunteered to participate in the study on the specified dates. The sample group consisted of 47 students because 6 students or their relatives became sick, 9 students filled their diaries incompletely, and 5 students stated that they did not want to continue. To determine the sample size for qualitative studies, a sampling approach is used that requires researchers to continue collecting data until sizes adequate for the saturation point are reached [29] . The sample group consisted of 47 students, and data saturation was achieved. The encodings of the participants are given in Table 1 . ",

We employed inductive content analysis to generate important meanings regarding the experience elicited from the individuals' perspective. No software program was used for the qualitative data analysis. In the qualitative analysis of the data transferred to the digital environment, a content analysis was carried out by taking into account the prevalence of the comments contained in the responses beyond the words, the number of participants who made the same interpretation and used the same word, what was meant to be said, and the originality of the answers. The diaries written by the students were combined considering the differences and similarities. After the raw data generated were carefully read by each researcher, the data were processed (coding meaningful concepts and themes). Themes were created by gathering the encoded data. During the analysis of the obtained data, raw data were given to two field experts who have researched on qualitative studies, and an expert opinion was obtained [28, 30] .",

It was stated that they watch the news of death in the country and the world every day, and they experience a lot of worry, anxiety, and fear. They stated that they were horrified by only watching the news about COVID-19 in the news bulletin, emphasizing that \"the circle is narrowing\" and that the fear increased even more when the news of the death of their relatives began to come. They stated that the reason for the fear and anxiety was having little information about the virus, the fear of being infected and their relatives being infected, and the uncertainty of what will happen in the future. They stated that the rapid spread of the virus in the world and in our country caused panic, and they were sad due to not being able to see their friends and relatives due to having to stay at home. It was emphasized that the process of removing clothes, bathing, washing hands every minute, and constant cleaning as soon as arriving home started in all segments of the society due to the fear and anxiety, and the number of people taking public transport has decreased. It was reported that during the process that started with lockdown and restrictions, there was anxiety and fear due to loss of freedom.

They wanted to become nurses as soon as possible and help healthcare professionals in this process, and they were proud of their profession. It is thought that the importance of the nursing profession has increased during the pandemic, that it became more visible in the society and the media, and the support of the public for healthcare professionals has positively affected the perceptions of nursing candidates regarding the profession. In the studies conducted, nursing students stated that their experiences during the pandemic improved them, they want to start working to provide healthcare services, and the support given to nurses by the public positively reinforces their career choices [42] [43] [44] . Ta\u015f et al. (2020) reported that 79.1% of nursing students stated that the COVID-19 pandemic affected their motivation, and 52.5% stated that their motivation was negatively affected. In addition, it is emphasized that the students' motivation is negatively affected due to lack of practical courses, distance education, the prestige of the nursing profession has increased, and their motivation has increased in relation to the realization of the importance of the nursing profession [45] . Cici et al. (2021) reported a decrease in the number of nursing students with a positive view of the nursing profession, and an increase in those with negative and undecided views about the profession. It was emphasized that the anxiety scores of those who have a negative view of the profession and those who do not want to have this profession in the future have significantly increased during the pandemic [19] . Velarde-Garc\u00eda et al. (2021), in their qualitative study, found that nursing students have difficulty in applying their knowledge and skills because they lack a defined role and competence [27] . In a study conducted in Turkey, they stated that nursing students could not acquire professional skills because they could not practice the vocational courses, and their skills regressed, causing a lack of self-confidence and a sense of inadequacy [26] . Qualitative studies have reported that nursing students feel responsible for their own society, want to take responsibility in nursing roles that support a holistic approach with their knowledge and skills, and once again, understand the importance, responsibilities, and risks of the nursing profession [24, 25] . It has been observed that the results of the study differ in the literature. It was found that the students used positive and negative coping methods during the pandemic. This result suggests that students who have negative coping behaviors are at risk in terms of their physical and mental health. In the literature, they reported that nursing students had difficulty in accepting the situation at first and were unprepared, but then they adapted. Students reported that they coped with using different psychological and situational coping strategies, using social media networks in their relationships with colleagues and peer groups, planning their basic daily routines as a stress management tool, healthy eating, physical exercise or planning rest periods, entertainment, humor, and religion [46] . In addition, it is stated that students use the strategies of seeking information and counseling, staying optimistic, and coping with transference [38] . state that university students experienced problems such as changing eating and sleeping habits, insufficient exercise, and weight gain [2] . In a study, it was stated that 15.84% of university students indicated that they could not cope with stress and benefit from health services. Students experienced problems such as a change in eating and sleeping habits, insufficient exercise, weight gain, excessive alcohol intake, isolation, and crying [47] . Son et al. (2020) found that 23% of university students used negative coping methods such as ignoring the news of COVID-19, sleeping longer, distracting them by doing other things, alcohol, and smoking [33] . In a study, 42.8% of the students had healthier eating behavior during the pandemic, and 2.9%, 6.3%, and 69.7% of the students, respectively, used \"unchanged or more\" smoking, drinking, and physical activity [12] . When the literature is reviewed, it is reported that nursing students had moderate coping behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic [12, 48] . In a study, it was stated that approximately half of the participants were able to cope with stress sufficiently; 15.84% could not cope or use healthcare services [2] . When the studies are examined, it is seen that university students used positive coping methods such as communicating with their family and friends, healthier eating behavior, meditation and breathing exercises, spiritual measures, maintaining routines, positive reframing, physical exercise, using social media, playing with pets, keeping a diary, listening to music, praying, reading, gardening, and drawing [2, 33, 49, 50] .",

The research is limited to nursing students studying at a university and the questions in the form. The size of the study group and the different characteristics of the participants constitute the strengths of the study. While collecting the data, the voluntary basis was emphasized in participation in the study. Correct and complete answers were obtained by establishing a relationship based on mutual trust with the participants. In this study, both the coding and the determination of the themes were carried out and compared separately by three researchers. A common vision has been reached as to which piece of data belongs to which code. After all data were coded, the coding was sent to two field experts of qualitative research, and an expert opinion was obtained. All researchers contributed to the analysis and writing process.",

It was found that nursing students used positive and negative coping methods during the pandemic. Nursing students who had difficulties in coping are at risk in terms of physical and mental health. In this context, empowering nursing students to cope with challenging emotions and thoughts starting from their educational life will contribute to the development of both students and the profession. It is thought that these findings obtained from the diaries of nursing students during the COVID-19 pandemic will guide them and the nursing profession in the following years. These diaries will guide nursing students in both their private and professional lives when there are other pandemics. Nurse educators can give nursing students educations about self-knowledge, self-awareness, anxiety and coping with difficult situations, healthy use of social media, making use of free time correctly and effectively, and recognizing and managing emotions.
