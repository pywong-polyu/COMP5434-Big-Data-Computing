The present experiments examine whether the generative learning activity of generating explanations can be extended to online multimedia lessons and whether prompts to engage in this generative learning activity work better than more passive instruction. Across three experiments, college students learned about greenhouse gasses from a 4-part online lesson involving captioned animations and subsequently took a posttest. After each part, learners were asked to generate an explanation (write-anexplanation), write an explanation using provided terms (write-a-focused-explanation), rewrite a provided explanation (rewrite-an-explanation), read a provided explanation (read-an-explanation), or simply move on to the next part (no-activity). Overall, students in the write-an-explanation group (Experiments 2 and 3), write-a-focused-explanation group (Experiment 2), and rewrite-an-explanation group (Experiment 3) performed significantly better on a delayed posttest than the no-activity group, but the groups did not differ significantly on an immediate posttest (Experiment 1). These results are consistent with generative learning theory and help identify generative learning strategies that improve online multimedia learning, thereby priming active learning with passive media.",

In the present set of three experiments, we focus on verbal learning strategies in written form because they are easiest to implement in a computer-based learning situation. In particular, across all three experiments, we ask students to write an explanation after each segment of a four-part animated lesson, which we call the write-an-explanation activity, using prompts shown in the first column of Table 1 to promote the verbal strategy of explanation. We focus on prompting students to generate explanations during an online multimedia lesson because this generative activity prompt appears to be powerful enough to cause learners to engage in several verbal activities and because of its potential to help engage students in an online lesson that might otherwise not foster sufficient student engagement. This approach is based on distinguishing between the external activity prompt (e.g., \"please write an explanation\") and the internal cognitive process that it may prime (e.g., explaining, summarizing, paraphrasing, etc.) . We focus on explaining during a pause after an animation rather than during an animation because an animation is transitory and subject to creating split attention when presented in conjunction with another task (Leahy & Sweller, 2011) .",

In a review, Fiorella and Mayer (2015) reported that in 44 of 54 experimental tests, students who were prompted to explain what they were reading or viewing performed better on a posttest than students who were not, yielding a median effect size of d = 0.61. This research includes studies involving reading static text lessons and studies involving viewing dynamic multimedia presentations. Research on learning by explaining dates back to Chi et al.'s (1989) early work on what they called self-explanation in which students spontaneously engaged in generating oral explanations for themselves as they read a text. This line of research morphed somewhat into research on prompts to write explanations during paper-based lessons and, more recently, during computer-based, online lessons. It should be noted that explaining to oneself (e.g., in the content of making sense of a lesson) may require different cognitive activities than explaining to others (e.g., in the context of being prompted to write an explanation). This paper focuses on a form of learning by explaining in which learners are prompted to write an explanation.",

While reading through the text, students were either prompted to create an explanation after reading each sentence or were told to simply read through the text twice. The students who were asked to create explanations while reading had bigger gains in understanding, especially when asked difficult questions, compared to those that had not explained. This research demonstrated the benefits of prompting students to engage in what they called selfexplanation while learning (and we call learning by explaining). From these early studies on learning by explaining, many more studies have tried to understand the when, how, and why asking students to generate explanations during learning is an effective learning tool (i.e., Atkinson et al., 2003; Johnson & Mayer, 2010; Margulieux & Catrambone, 2018; McEldoon et al., 2013) . Much of the research investigating learning by explaining has found it beneficial to student learning across different instructional materials, different topics, and different students. Additionally, a meta-analysis found that asking students to generate explanations during learning resulted in better test performance as compared to direct instruction, regardless of timing, content, and format of the explanations (Bisra et al., 2018) .",

However, this type of medium also introduces new challenges based on the transient nature of the presented material.

The effect is found with inference and transfer questions, but not always with retention questions, suggesting that the act of generating explanations may help learners process the information more deeply (De Koning et al., 2011 ). Yet, some research finds that prompts to explain, when used in conjunction with an animation, are no better than providing direct instruction without prompts to explain (De Koning et al., 2010; Lin et al., 2016) . Other research finds that prompting students to explain a dynamic presentation in pairs can be more beneficial than giving students an already developed explanation (Ryoo & Linn, 2014) .

A cause of the cognitive load increase from using animations in a computer-based lesson is that the information is not permanently onscreen (Leahy & Sweller, 2011; Spanjers et al., 2010; Wong et al., 2012) . The transitory nature of the information of an animated lesson causes more processing load to the learner than a static picture. On top of that, having learners also engage in a difficult task, like generating an explanation, requires more cognitive load capacity to be used and can cause cognitive overload rather than a beneficial effect (Lin et al., 2016) . We attempt to overcome this potential problem in the present study by prompting learners to explain during pauses in a multimedia lesson.",

First, this set of studies investigates how prompts to generate explanations can be added into an online lesson. Especially now, online lessons are becoming more prominent and a struggle many learners are facing is the lack of engagement that the technology promotes. This research aims to understand how to add a constructive component to learning that is often more passive and lacks an engaging pull. Second, this research uses a multimedia lesson that is commercially available, in an attempt to understand how to improve educational material that is already being used by learners. Much of the research on learning by explaining has not focused directly on multimedia presentations involving animation and the ones that have examined lessons with animation have shown conflicting results (De Koning et al., 2010; De Koning et al., 2011; Lin & Atkinson, 2013; Lin et al., 2016; Wouters et al., 2008) . Lastly, this research involves delayed testing, which is often not used when investigating the effects of learning by explaining.",

The ICAP framework proposes a taxonomy that differentiates four types of engagement during learning and orders them from lowest to highest level of engagement. Passive, the lowest level of engagement, occurs when there is no overt action occurring during learning, such as simply viewing a multimedia lesson. Active, the second level, occurs when the learner engages in a shallow level of overt action during learning, such as reading printed words aloud in each segment of a multimedia lesson. Constructive, the third level, occurs when learners generate information that goes beyond the given lesson, such as writing an explanation for each segment of a multimedia lesson. Interactive, the highest level of engagement, occurs when there is some sort of interaction with another person or computer agent during a multimedia lesson such as discussing the meaning of each segment of a multimedia lesson with another student. According to the ICAP framework, learning by explaining (or what can be called self-explanation) as implemented in the present study falls under the constructive level (Chi & Wylie, 2014) . This is because learners are generating an explanation that goes beyond the given information but are not interacting with others.",

We measure learning outcomes with a broad posttest that involves writing answers to open-ended questions about the processes involved in greenhouse gases. Classic theory and research on meaningful learning suggests that learning in a meaningful way creates a more durable memory representation that persists in a coherent form longer than learning in a rote way, which is reflected in some evidence that the effects of meaningful learning show up better on a delayed test than on an immediate test (Katona, 1942; Mayer & Wittrock, 2006; Wertheimer, 1959) . Importantly, this pattern has been observed in modern research on generative learning strategies such as learning by testing (also called retrieval practice) in which the effects of studying and self-testing are superior to studying and studying again when students take a delayed test but not when they take an immediate test (Brown et al., 2014; Dunlosky et al., 2013; Fiorella & Mayer, 2015 Roediger III & Karpicke, 2006) . Additionally, the ICAP framework suggests that deeper learning occurs when higher levels of engagement are met; accordingly, activities that encourage more engagement should engender higher delayed test performance than those who have lower levels of engagement. Thus, in the present study, we examine whether effects of generative activities are stronger on delayed tests than on immediate tests.",

In the present study, the difference between the treatment groups and the no-activity groups include learner activity and engagement as well as access to a written explanation. In order to control for access to a statement of explanation, we included a control group that simply reads an instructor-provided explanation after each of the four segments of the lesson but does not engage in activity (i.e., read-an-explanation group). Similar to hypothesis 1, writing an explanation and rewriting an explanation both require generative activity that is not required for reading an explanation and they are at a higher level of the ICAP framework than passively reading an explanation. Accordingly, we predict that the write-an-explanation group will outperform the read-an-explanation group on the posttest in Experiments 1, 2, and 3 (hypothesis 2a), the write-a-focused-explanation group will outperform the read-an-explanation group on the posttest in Experiments 1 and 2 (hypothesis 2b), and the rewrite-an-explanation group will outperform the read-an-explanation group on the posttest in Experiment 3 (hypothesis 2c).",

Based on this analysis, we predict that in Experiments 1 and 2, the write-anexplanation group should perform similarly to the write-a-focused-explanation group in (hypothesis 3). Additionally, this framework suggests that engaging in a learning activity at the constructive level, such as writing an explanation, should lead to better learning than a learning activity at the active level, such as rewriting an explanation. Based on this analysis, we predict that the write-an-explanation group should outperform the rewrite-an-explanation group on the posttest in Experiment 3 (hypothesis 4).

We chose to use the checklist as our measure of prior knowledge rather than a pretest on material from the lesson because we want to avoid a testing effect in which the act of taking a test is an instructional even that causes learning (Brown et al., 2014; Roediger III & Karpicke, 2006) and we wanted to avoid guiding learners' attention to lesson material that could be primed by the pretest questions. The Cronbach's alpha for the objective checklist assessment (with possible scores from 0 to 11 based on the number of checked items) is 0.64. An explanation for the sub-optimal internal consistency is that the checklist was designed to tap diverse situations across a variety of sub-domains that were intended to assess students' broad background knowledge about the environment rather than to assess specific knowledge of greenhouse gases with a set of similar statements.",

Screenshots of the slides are shown in Fig. 1 . The lesson animations came from a KQED public television lesson on greenhouse gases, found here: https://ww2.kqed.org/quest/2014/12/12/how-dogreenhouse-gases-work/. In the slides, students learned about how the Earth absorbs light from the sun, which is then expelled from the Earth as infrared radiation. This radiation interacts with greenhouse gases and causes the gases to vibrate and warm up the air around them. When there are more greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, the temperature rises quickly because there are more interactions occurring causing more vibrations.",

Learning remotely can be an isolating experience that primes a passive stance in learners, so it is worthwhile to incorporate effective prompts to engage in generative activities-including writing or rewriting an explanation after each section of an onscreen lesson. Thus, this research demonstrates how beneficial it can be for instructors to incorporate explanation prompts into their more passive lessons, especially if the goal of presenting the material to help learners develop a deeper and persisting understanding of the material. However, if the goal of the instruction is to perform well on an immediate test, prompting explanations may not be the most effective strategy.",

When learning, most individuals engage with multiple lessons that build on top of one another that require more than an hour of learning.

Future research should investigate how generating an explanation and rewriting an explanation may benefit students over a longterm course in a class or school-like environment.",

Although this may suggest that time is the crucial factor leading the differences in the groups, there is an alternate explanation, as discussed earlier. It could be the fact that additional time is an integral part of the activity of explaining because writing an explanation takes longer than simply reading through a lesson. Although we attempted to separate the effects of time and effects of the activity in our studies, there is still a possibility that the benefits are due to time. To truly understand if time and explanation prompt are confounded, future research should conduct the same experiment but require all participants to spend the same amount of time on each slide. Although this is not ecologically valid and therefore subject to criticism as well, controlling for study time in this way would allow for a straightforward test of the effects of explanation prompts on learning outcome. Additionally, in some situations oral explanations could be used in place of written explanations and the control group could be asked to read the material twice to minimize time differences across groups, similar to how Chi et al. (1994) conducted their study.",
