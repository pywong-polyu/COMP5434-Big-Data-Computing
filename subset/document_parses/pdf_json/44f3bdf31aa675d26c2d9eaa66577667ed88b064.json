In England this led to a policy proposal and \u00a3100million (US$130million) of funding for all emergency departments to have co-located GP services. However, there is a lack of evidence for whether such service models are effective and safe. We examined diagnostic errors reported in patient safety incident reports to develop theories to explain how and why they occurred to inform potential priority areas for improvement and inform qualitative data collection at case study sites to further refine the theories. Methods: We used a mixed-methods design using exploratory descriptive analysis to identify the most frequent and harmful sources of diagnostic error and thematic analysis, incorporating realist methodology to refine theories from an earlier rapid realist review, to describe how and why the events occurred and could be mitigated, to inform improvement recommendations. We used two UK data sources: Coroners' reports to prevent future deaths (30.7.13-14.08.18) and National Reporting and Learning System (NRLS) patient safety incident reports (03.01.05-30.11.15). Results: Nine Coroners' reports (from 1347 community and hospital reports, 2013-2018) and 217 NRLS reports (from 13 million, 2005-2015) were identified describing diagnostic error related to GP services in or alongside emergency departments. Initial theories to describe potential priority areas for improvement included: difficulty identifying appropriate patients for the GP service; under-investigation and misinterpretation of diagnostic tests; and inadequate communication and referral pathways between the emergency and GP services. High-risk presentations included: musculoskeletal injury, chest pain, headache, calf pain and sick children.",

At the time of this study, NRLS reports were available up to 2015, updated searches may have identified further incident reports, potentially with additional themes indicating areas for improvement. GPs are recognised as low patient safety incident reporters, which may also have contributed to the low number of reports identified [22] . We have not included reports describing diagnostic errors occurring in usual emergency department care -whether GPs make relatively fewer or more errors on the same patients than emergency department staff doctors is unknown. The Cohen's kappa statistic indicates that inter-rater reliability was moderate however this was strengthened by researcher one being an experienced GP and patient safety and qualitative researcher. Stakeholder feedback also strongly supported findings.",

These two different lenses complement each other for understanding unsafe care, in terms of what happened and perceived causes for both the most serious and other incidents with a range of severity outcomes. Our small sample size is a limitation to the generalizability of our findings but the realist evaluation approach aims to build theory rather than provide definitive answers. Incorporating a realist approach into the thematic analysis of these data, we believe is novel. It structured the process of raising hypotheses to infer how and why these incidents occurred, and look for demiregularities (patterns) to give greater understanding of possible causation. The theories can then be taken forward and tested against qualitative data collected/generated at case study sites with the aim of producing useful, insightful, actionable findings. These insights may also be applied to other new healthcare services where different healthcare providers take on additional roles. Systematic reviews may have identified further interventions to mitigate such events.",

Implementation of the new Emergency Care Dataset (ECDS) in England, with the intent to extend soon into Ambulance and Integrated Urgent Care will ensure that in future there will be improved quantitative data to identify both presenting conditions and outcomes in patients who access Urgent and Emergency Care services to improve understanding of diagnostic errors in these settings.

The 'Coroners reports to prevent future deaths' dataset is available on the Courts and Tribunals Judiciary Website, https://www.judiciary.uk/related-offices-andbodies/office-chief-coroner/https-www-judiciary-uk-subject-community-health-careand-emergency-services-related-deaths/",

Analysis of NRLS reports was also reviewed as part of the wider \"GPs in EDs\" study (National Institute for Healthcare Research HS&DR: 15/145/04) and given a favourable ethical opinion on 23/11/17 by the Wales Research Ethics Committee (REF: 17/WA/03). No ethical approval was sought for analysis of the Coroners reports since these are publicly available data.",
