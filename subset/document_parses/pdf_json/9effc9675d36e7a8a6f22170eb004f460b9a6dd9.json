The pneumonia spread quickly to other provinces of China and overseas. A novel coronavirus was identified by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention from the throat swab sample of a patient and was provisionally named 2019-nCoV by the World Health Organization (WHO) [2] . Based on phylogeny, taxonomy and established practice, the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses renamed the virus as Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) [3] . WHO subsequently declared coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) a public health emergency of international concern [4] . COVID-19 is primarily manifested as a respiratory tract infection, but emerging data indicate that it should be regarded as a systemic disease involving multiple systems, including cardiovascular, respiratory, gastrointestinal, neurological, hematopoietic, immune and renal [5] [6] [7] [8] . Of note, after lung infection, the virus may enter the blood, accumulate in the kidney and cause damage to resident renal cells, with a significantly higher risk for in-hospital death [8] . Thus, understanding how the kidney is affected by SARS-CoV-2 is particularly relevant. The incidence of acute kidney injury (AKI) in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 varies across populations, but a large multicenter retrospective cohort study in New York reported AKI in 37% of hospitalized patients, and 35% of those died [9] . AKI initiation coincides with the development of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), and these alterations are typical of patients progressing to the most severe stage of illness involving extra-pulmonary systemic hyperinflammation [10] .",

Of those, 12 had pneumonia due to other causes; 19 were transferred to other hospitals due to local saturation; and 60 had incomplete clinical files. Thirty-six patients of the group with incomplete clinical files were not hospitalized because they had a ratio of PaO 2 /FiO 2 > 300 mm Hg, with acceptable metabolic control (glycemic, kidney and hepatic functions). Therefore, they were trained on the use of supplemental oxygen, the recognition of worsening symptoms, and were monitored from home. The clinical files of the remaining 24 patients were unavailable due to the accelerated reconversion of our institution for exclusive treatment of patients with COVID-19. From the electronic records, we confirmed that five of those patients died and none of them developed AKI during the observation period at hospital. We thus included 99 individuals in the study (Fig 1) .",

Obesity was a risk factor for AKI and mortality in our cohort, and it has been reported as a common comorbidity in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 [19, 20] , and as a risk factor for hospital admission and need for critical care [21] . This is particularly relevant for countries with high obesity rates, such as Mexico. In the adult Mexican population, the combined prevalence of overweight and obesity is approximately 71% [22] . It has been suggested that chronic inflammation in obesity is apparent, with an increased level of interleukin-6, adipokines and pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., TNF-alpha, interferon), inducing a chronic low-grade inflammatory state and impairing immune response [23, 24] . A possible mechanism related to COVID-19 severity in obese persons is speculated to occur through a functional restrictive capacity of the obese lung. It would also be interesting to understand whether the obese patients had higher PEEP or driving pressure that could account for the higher risk for AKI. Unfortunately, PEEP data retrieval was incomplete in our retrospective review of medical records, so we were unable to perform this analysis. The need for mechanical ventilation on admission was also a risk factor for AKI in our cohort. It is well known that the main causes of AKI are hypoxia, ischemia and nephrotoxicity. The kidney is particularly susceptible to ischemia and toxins, resulting in vasoconstriction, endothelial damage, and activation of inflammatory processes [25] . In hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19, the important relationship between AKI and respiratory failure was previously reported [9] . The requirement of vasoactive drugs on admission was a risk factor for mortality in our cohort. This is not surprising if we consider that vasoactive drugs are used in the most critically ill patients with septic shock and evidence of renal dysfunction [26] . In this context, early start of vasopressor support is aimed at having a more rapid restoration of blood flow in combination with lower fluid accumulation, allowing early restitution of tissue perfusion while avoiding fluid overload-mediated harm [27] .",

That study was performed in a heterogeneous population of patients exposed to different nephrotoxic factors (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, aminoglycosides, amphotericin, contrast, post-cardiac surgery and sepsis). We found lower values of AUC (0.681), sensitivity (81.6%) and specificity (54.5%). Differences between studies may be partially explained by the fact that we only included patients with sepsis related with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Despite these considerations, we deem that the furosemide stress test is an easy, non-invasive and accessible technique which may contribute to predict the severity of AKI in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Larger, prospective validations of the furosemide stress test in patients with severe COVID-19 are required because improving risk prediction in those with early AKI would be of high value for patient care and clinical decision making.",

The lack of pre-hospital baseline sCr measurements was also a study limitation because baseline sCr values were an estimation. Since we could not assess the baseline renal status, we could not explore whether CKD itself is a risk factor for AKI in the context of COVID-19. One additional study limitation is that we retrieved information during hospitalization, but a longer observation period would have provided additional information regarding the clinical outcome and the impact of AKI in the population studied. That is, we were not able to report the proportion of individuals developing CKD in the group with AKI. Finally, our study was conducted at a national referral center for respiratory diseases receiving disproportionately more patients with severe COVID-19, and this represents a potential source of referral bias. Nevertheless, this particular cohort was suitable for identifying the risk factors for AKI in Mexican individuals with severe COVID-19.",
