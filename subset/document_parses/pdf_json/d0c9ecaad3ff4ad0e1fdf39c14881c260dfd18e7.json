            "text": "The present study examined individual characteristics potentially associated with changes in mitigation behaviors (social distancing and hygiene) recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Analysis of online survey responses from 361 adults, ages 20-78, with US IP addresses, identified significant correlates of adaptive behavioral changes, with implications for preventive strategies and mental health needs. The extent to which individuals changed their mitigation behaviors was unrelated to self-rated health or concern regarding the personal effects of COVID-19 but was related to concern regarding the effects of the pandemic on others. Thus, mitigation behaviors do not appear to be primarily motivated by self-protection. Importantly, adaptive changes in mitigation behaviors increased with age. However, these changes, particularly those related to the frequency of close proximity encounters, appear to be due to age-related decreases in anxiety and depression. Taken together, the present results argue against over-reliance on 'fear appeals' in public health messages as they may increase anxiety and depression. Instead, the present findings argue for more appeals to people's concern for others to motivate mitigation as well as indicating an immediate need to address individual mental health concerns for the sake of society as a whole.",

Age is not the only factor associated with greater-than-average risks from COVID-19. Being male, for example, also appears to be associated with the risk of serious complications and even mortality, with poverty being another notable risk factor [3] . Of special interest from a public health perspective are behaviors that either increase the risk (close proximity interactions or actual physical contact with non-household members) or decrease the risk (disinfecting one's hands and commonly used surfaces) of contracting COVID-19 and that could be appropriately modified. With respect to age, previous studies suggest that its relation to perceived risks associated with COVID-19 are complicated. For example, the perceived risk of death from COVID-19 increases with age (e.g., mortality risk), but the perceived risk of being infected decreases with age as does the perceived risk of running out of money [4, 5] . It is unclear how these risk perceptions combine to affect mitigation behaviors, particularly in older adults, although structural equation modeling suggests that the perceived effectiveness of mitigation behaviors and not perceived COVID-19 risks predicts mitigation behaviors [6] .",

To date, published studies have examined vaccination intentions and, perhaps surprisingly, men are more likely than women to intend to get vaccinated [10, 11] .

If people high in trait anxiety were more likely to engage in social distancing, for example, one would not be able to increase the trait anxiety of others low on this trait in order to promote such behavior, whereas if people high in state anxiety were the ones more likely to engage in social distancing, then one might try to raise everyone's level of state anxiety. Importantly, the state/trait distinction has implications for public health messaging, because individual differences in trait anxiety are not predictive of the efficacy of fear messages (e.g., messages emphasizing risk), whereas such messages may well increase state anxiety, and indeed, may be intended to do so [14] .",

These included the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), which measures state anxiety and depression and has shown the ability to track changes in these states [15] , as well as a new pandemic questionnaire we developed that includes items assessing concerns about potential effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on oneself and others. Our pandemic questionnaire also measured self-reported frequencies of four CDC-recommended mitigation behaviors that concerned both social distancing (i.e., not being within six feet of someone outside one's household and avoiding physical contact with such a person) and hygiene (i.e., washing or disinfecting one's hands and disinfecting frequently touched objects and surfaces). The frequencies of mitigation behaviors are especially important because they represent potentially modifiable risk factors.

For example, fear messages appear to work better when what is recommended is a one-time response, rather than a recurring activity as is the case with the mitigation behaviors recommended by the CDC [16] , whereas messages emphasizing benefits to the community may work better for behaviors that need to be maintained. Examination of the relations between age and mitigation behaviors, on the one hand, and anxiety and depression, on the other hand, should shed light on the potential effects of increasing people's state anxiety with fear messages and on the utility of this approach with respect to the current public health situation.",

These measures are labelled Proximity, Contact, Hand hygiene, and Home hygiene, respectively. The frequency of each behavior was investigated in two separate time frames, namely \"on average this week\" and \"several months ago,\" which, it should be noted, was mid-February, 2020, at the latest). Scores could range from 1 (never) to 5 (highest frequency). Also, measures of change in frequency (Now minus Before) were calculated for each of the four mitigation behaviors assessed. The symbol \u0394 indicates that a measure represents change in the frequency of a mitigation behavior. The second part of the Pandemic Questionnaire consisted of questions as to participants' degree of concern about the effects of the pandemic on themselves and on others, and the third part asked questions regarding participants' subjective wellbeing at the present time, two months previously, two months from the current time, and two years from the current time. Finally, participants were asked their gender, their age and date of birth (for verification), how many years of education they had completed, their ethnicity and race (as requested by the National Institutes of Health), and their annual individual and household income and zip code.",

The reason for examining whether or not adaptive changes had occurred was to determine whether there was converging evidence for those variables identified in the preceding analyses as associates of change in mitigation behaviors and to estimate which of those variables might provide the biggest return from a public health perspective because they were associated with the most changed behaviors. Only about one-third (35.5%) of the participants reported an adaptive change in hand hygiene, and none of the 13 variables studied was significantly associated with changes in hand hygiene in previous analyses, perhaps because such changes were obscured by the frequency of handwashing before eating and after using the toilet. Therefore, hand hygiene was not included in any further analyses. In contrast to the results for hand hygiene, approximately half of the participants reported adaptive changes in home hygiene (49.0%), and approximately two-thirds reported adaptive changes in the frequency of close proximity encounters and physical contact (67.3% and 65.1%, respectively). Taken together, approximately four-fifths (82.0%) of the participants reported an adaptive change in at least one of these mitigation behaviors. Accordingly, the present analyses focused on the five variables that, after correcting for multiple comparisons, had been identified as significant correlates of the amount of change in social distancing and home hygiene: Age, Concern for Others, Depression, Anxiety, and Household Income. All of the variables except Concern for others were related to whether or not the two social distancing measures changed, but only Concern for Others was associated with the occurrence of adaptive change in Home Hygiene. Importantly, all five of these previously identified variables were correlated with the total number of mitigation behaviors by a participant that showed adaptive changes (Table 6 ). Analogous to the findings with respect to amount of change, the fact that the correlations with Anxiety and Depression were again negative meant that the higher the participants' scores on these scales, the smaller the number of adaptive changes in mitigation behaviors they reported.

Most notably, participants significantly increased their social distancing, which is to say that they decreased the frequency of close proximity encounters with people other than those they lived with and also decreased the frequency of physical contact with anyone outside their household. Importantly, participants' age, which is known to be a major risk factor for hospitalization, serious complications and even death from a COVID-19 infection [1, 3, 25] , was significantly associated with the degree of adaptive change in both social distancing behaviors. Changes in social distancing behaviors were positively correlated with anxiety and depression, with participants who had higher levels of anxiety and/or depression being both less likely to have decreased the frequency of close proximity encounters and physical contact with people outside their household members and to have made smaller changes if they did increase their social distancing. Consistent with previous reports [26] , however, anxiety and depression in the current sample were generally rather high and decreased with age, raising the possibility that the reason older adults were more likely to make larger adaptive changes in their mitigation behaviors was because they were less anxious and depressed. Further analysis yielded results consistent with this interpretation. When the sample was divided into those whose anxiety and depression scores were below cutoffs for anxiety and depressive disorders and those with at least one score above the cutoffs, adaptive change in the frequency of close proximity encounters was not significantly related to age in the former group (i.e., those with scores below the cutoffs).",

Although social desirability might play some role in both self-reports and actual behavior change, the fact that self-reported changes were much larger for distancing than for hygiene, combined with the low correlations between all but the two distancing measures (see Table 3 ), argue against general social desirability as an explanation for the reported changes in mitigation behaviors. We believe that distancing changed much more than hygiene because social deprivation not only leads to loneliness but also causes increases in anxiety and depression, which were significantly correlated in the present study, and social interaction relieves the stress caused by social deprivation [27, 28] .",

            "text": "The present results suggest that more anxious and depressed people are choosing to alleviate or at least not aggravate their anxiety and/or depression by distancing. Further evidence for the idea that high anxiety and depression scores are the result of social deprivation comes from a study that examined anxiety levels as measured by the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-2 screening tool [29] used in the National Health Information Survey and the Understanding America Study. The proportion of participants with high levels of anxiety symptoms had more than doubled from their 2019 levels by the beginning of April, 2020, when stay-at-home orders were in effect in most states. When many states ended such restrictions in May, anxiety levels immediately dropped to near half their April levels, still higher than 2019 but much lower than during the stay-at-home period. Notably, although both case and death rates also declined [26] , they did so to a much smaller extent than anxiety. Thus, the decrease in anxiety suggests that it was social isolation that had been responsible for the previous high levels. It may be noted, however, that the percentage of participants in the Household Pulse Survey who reported anxiety symptoms showed a much smaller, but still significant decrease from late April to mid-May of 2020 [26] . Higher household income was associated with increased social distancing, but neither education nor individual income, both of which tend to be higher for higher-status occupations, were significant associates, although the absence of significant correlations with education may reflect restriction of range (approximately 85% had some college and almost 2/3 had at least 4 years). Those with lower household incomes were less likely to decrease the frequency of close proximity encounters, but the fact that individual income was not correlated with distancing, whereas household income was, suggests that an individual's financial resources are more important than their occupation in providing the opportunity to practice social distancing. In addition, it has been argued that lack of resources of any kind, not just financial resources, induces a 'scarcity mindset' that causes people to focus more on decisions relevant to the scarce commodity and to neglect other problems [30] . Scarce financial resources, for example, may lead to the neglect of health-related issues such as those raised by the pandemic, but the same may apply to scarcity of social interactions, with the same result.",

This finding is important because of its implications for public health messaging. The use of 'fear appeal' messaging in public health communications (e.g., health warnings on cigarette packages) has a long history of mixed results [32] , and the mix of successes and failures with such messages is frequently attributed to people having both adaptive and defensive responses to such messages [14] .

Evidence that altruistic appeals might motivate mitigation behavior in nonmedical personnel on a large scale comes from survey responses during the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) epidemic in which people indicated that they would be willing to accept isolation and quarantine in order to help stop the spread of the disease to others [35] . Indeed, it has been suggested that altruistic appeals not only can lead to acceptance of mitigation behaviors like social isolation, but may even prevent long-term negative consequences, including post-traumatic stress disorder [36] , that may continue to affect some people long after the pandemic is over.",

Finally, the correlations among mitigation behaviors and the finding that the variables associated with individual mitigation behaviors are also associated with the number of such behaviors that showed adaptive, CDC-recommended changes suggests that rather than affecting a single mitigation behavior, efforts to improve people's psychological state or their financial situation may efficiently increase the likelihood of changes in multiple mitigation behaviors.",
