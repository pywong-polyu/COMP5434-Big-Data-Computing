The International Council for Standardization in Haematology (ICSH) stated the increasing need for diagnostics to perform point-ofcare full blood counts and published guidelines for their application [1] . While fingerprick blood testing is not new for common analytes like glucose [2] , it is less common for cells, like platelets. Fingerprick platelet counts can be performed in a medical PoC setting, however fingerprick blood testing suitable for home use is not available. This has the potential to improve the management of patients receiving vaccines to SARS-CoV-2 [3] , drugs which could induce immune thrombocytopenia [4] or platelet disorders [5] .",

Studies comparing fingerpick and venous blood counts have shown a variety of results. Schalk et al. 2007 showed fingerprick samples had higher white blood cell count (WBC), higher red blood cell count (RBC), and equal platelet count (PLT) [6] . Hollis et al., 2012 showed equivalent WBC counts [7] . Randels et al. 1997 showed lower fingerprick platelet counts [8] . Furthermore, blood cell counts may show large variability for each drop of blood acquired [9] . These studies taken together imply that sampling method for blood cell analysis from fingerprick greatly affect its utility. Nevertheless, there are successful cases of fingerprick blood being used to do blood cell analysis in medical settings. For fingerprick and venous sample comparisons (N = 189), the BD FACSPresto\u2122 demonstrated an R 2 = 0.973 for absolute CD4 counts and 0.935 for hemoglobin [10] . HemoCue\u2122 WBC DIFF had no differences (p = 0.105) in paired samples (N = 8) [11] , and the Hemoscreen\u2122 has a 510k clearance for fingerstick and venous complete blood counts [12] .",

The ISLH method relies on two central lab instruments, a cytometer to count CD41/CD61-tagged platelets and an impedance analyzer to provide a reference RBC concentration. At PoC medical settings, the impedance-based CLIA-waived XW-100 does not report platelet values below 100K/ \u03bcL.

The sample loader precisely delivers the entire fixed microvolume into the instrument, allowing absolute volumetric sample analysis. After delivery, the sample is analyzed by a compact, palm-sized optical block that performs flow cytometry [17] . The instrument is 1.5 kg, USB-powered, and highly portable [18] .

The sample were also analyzed on a clinical analyzer to determine the red blood cell counts per microliter of whole blood. The flow cytometry red blood cells number was divided by the clinical analyzer red blood cell concentration to calculate the total whole blood volume used for the flow cytometer. For both methods, the platelet #/microliter concentration was generated by multiplying the dilution factor. The same dilution was used for both analysis methods to reduce variability. To best capture the range of possible platelet counts seen in normal and low platelet populations, three dilutions of blood were included representing (neat, 1:4 and 1:16) which equated to final dilutions of 1:1000, 1:4000 and 1: 16,000.",

This study has shown that the platelet count using a fingerprick blood sample is comparable to the venous platelet count and the rHEALTH method can perform platelet counts comparable to the gold standard ISLH method [14] , developed to address shortcomings of the impedance only method in measuring thrombocytopenic samples. Since the rHEALTH ONE is a small device, it has the potential to perform measurements at the point-of-care where fingerprick blood samples are readily obtained. In contrast, the ISLH method requires two large instruments in a laboratory setting, which is most compatible with venous blood samples. The ISLH method is the preferred standard method for calibrating platelet counts for reference samples, especially those with thrombocytopenia.",

Good correlation (R 2 > 0.90) was observed in all cases of the rHEALTH with Coulter ISLH. This should allow fingerprick blood samples to be used for assessing a patient's platelet counts. The optimized fingerprick sample collection was important. The choice of lancet was important in getting good sample flow and the mixing of the sample with a saline K3EDTA solution ensured proper anti-coagulation. In the context of interfering substances, the rHEALTH was most reliable, had the best precision, and met our < 12.5% precision success criteria, where only platelet fragments and anti-platelet antibodies substantially interfered with proper recovery of platelet counts. The TE was less than TEa of 25% under the most stringent conditions with high levels of interferents and thrombocytopenic counts, allowing accurate results under simulated disease conditions.

Addition of a pressurized fluid bladder system, as we have tested on parabolic flights [19] , will make the instrument fully operational in zero gravity.

Left, 8 \u03bcl capillary blood sample in a clear plastic consumable is loaded into the instrument for analysis. Middle, The sample consumable is received by a plunger-based, in-line sample loader which seals around its two open ends. Pressure (~70 mbar) is applied to the system which drives the entire sample volume, via hydrodynamic focusing, into a miniaturized optical module for laser-based cytometry detection. A fluidics module with electronic valves manages fluids from the pressurized sheath and clean bottles (60 cc). The analyzed sample passes through the optical block and into the removable waste bottle (60 cc). The electronics with embedded software manage instrument control and data capture. Dashed lines indicate connection to the optical and fluidics modules. Arrows from the electronics module indicate a control function and arrows to the electronics indicate a data function. The USB provides power, control commands, and data output to and from a PC. Right, The device is shown in its side view with dimensions, mass, USB 2.0 port, and sample loading orientation. A PC computer (not shown) provides power (up to 2.5W) via the USB connection, collects raw data, and performs data analysis. B. XY scattergraphs generated by Coulter cytometer in quadrant analysis.
