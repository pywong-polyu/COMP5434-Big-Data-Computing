Failure to generate hepatitis B virus (HBV)-specific antibodies is well-known in patients with end-stage renal disease. However, whether and to what extent HBV-specific cellular immunity is altered in this population and how it influences humoral immunity is not clear. To address it, we analyzed HBV-reactive T cells and antibodies in hemodialysis patients post vaccination. 29 hemodialysis patients and 10 healthy controls were enrolled in a cross-sectional study. Using multiparameter flow cytometry, HBV-reactive T cells were analyzed and functionally dissected based on granzyme B, interferon-g (IFN-g), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-a), interleukin-2 (IL-2), and IL-4 expression. Importantly, HBV-reactive CD4 + T cells were detected not only in all patients with sufficient titers but also in 70% of non-responders. Furthermore, a correlation between the magnitude of HBV-reactive CD4 + T cells and post-vaccination titers was observed. In summary, our data showed that HBV-reactive polyfunctional T cells were present in the majority of hemodialysis patients even if humoral immunity failed. Further studies are required to confirm their in vivo antiviral capacity. The ability to induce vaccine-reactive T cells paves new ways for improved vaccination and therapy protocols.",

            "text": "Appropriate immunization against hepatitis B virus (HBV) is one of the therapeutic priorities in ESRD management. Its importance is emphasized by lower virus clearance and higher chronification rate in this patient group. 4, 5 The chronic diseased course often results in liver fibrosis and higher incidence of liver malignancies. Moreover, other systemic complications are not uncommon in chronic HBV course. Last but not least, chronic HBV infection is a severe obstacle in kidney transplantation and subsequent posttransplant immunosuppression. 6 ESRD patients show significantly lower HBV vaccination efficacy as compared to healthy individuals. 7 Despite intensified approaches, on average 60% of ESRD patients achieve sufficient anti-hepatitis B surface antibody (anti-HBs) titers as compared to 95% in healthy populations. [8] [9] [10] The exact underlying mechanisms for failed vaccination are not clear. Besides direct immunotoxic effects of numerous uremic metabolites, lack of growth factors and hormones and inadequate insulin availability resulting in impaired cellular and humoral immunity are discussed among reasons for failed vaccination. [11] [12] [13] Further, impaired cell function due to the membrane contacts and dialysis shear stress was suspected among reasons for immune deficiency in this patient cohort. 3, 14, 15 Due to the lower vaccination efficacy, alternative protocols for HBV vaccination in hemodialysis patients and in posttransplant settings, as well as other clinical groups, were developed. With standard vaccine composition, these protocols exploit higher application doses and increased boosting. Further approaches imply alternative vaccine preparations with different adjuvants and whole-length HBs-antigen. [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] Sufficient anti-HBs-specific post-vaccination titers are broadly considered as the marker of vaccination efficiency and a correlate of HBV-specific protection. [24] [25] [26] However, the role of HBs-reactive T cells in vaccination cannot be simplified to B cell helper function alone. The high frequency of HBs-reactive T cells in resolving acute hepatitis B, as well as the lack of these cells in chronic HBV infections, provide evidence for the antiviral protection of these cells. Further, HBs-specific T cells might compensate for lacking antibody titers in HBV. 27, 28 Last but not least, HBV vaccination is a unique human in vivo infectious disease model and corresponding vaccine-based protection presents new insights into the function of immune system and generation of pathogen-specific protection under normal and pathological conditions. Furthermore, these insights allow identification of new predictive markers of vaccination efficiency with a broad translational potential in numerous vaccination settings, as well as immune-based cell therapies.",

Although the prevalence of IFN-g-producing HBs-specific CD4 + T cells among study groups was comparable to that of TNF-a ( Figure 1B) , the frequencies of these were lower as compared to TNF-a-and IL-2-producers (both as relative frequencies and absolute numbers, Figure 2 ). We could also identify HBs-reactive cytotoxic T helper (Th) cells based on GrB expression. However, the prevalence of GrB-producing T cells among the study cohorts was relatively low and showed no significant differences ( Figure 1B) . Altogether, we could not identify any significant differences in prevalence of HBs-reactive T cells among study groups, neither for single cytokine producers nor for cytokine-independent CD154 + HBs-reactive Th cells.

For this, complete HBs-specific Th cells and cytokine-producing subsets (single or combined) were analyzed as relative frequencies and absolute numbers. As in the NR study group, HBs-specific titers could not be determined (below detection level), and this cohort was assigned HBs-titer of 9. For HR cohort with titers > 1,000, the value of 1,001 was assigned. We could demonstrate significant correlation for HBs-reactive CD154 + Th cells irrespective of cytokine-producing capacities (Spearman correlation coefficient r = 0.5; p = 0.0057 for relative frequencies and r = 0.59; p = 0.0021 for absolute cell numbers), CD154 + TNF-a + (r = 0.58; p = 0.0014 for relative frequencies and r = 0.55; p = 0.0008 for absolute cell numbers), CD154 + IL-2 + (r = 0.72; p < 0.001 for relative frequencies and r = 0.77; p < 0.001 for absolute cell numbers), and combined CD154 + TNF-a + IL-2 + Th cells (r = 0.69; p < 0.001 for both relative frequencies and absolute cell numbers; Figure 4 ). In order to analyze the immunotoxic influence of uremia metabolites in ESRD study cohorts and vaccination outcome, we assessed absolute cell numbers of peripheral blood T and B cells. This analysis revealed no differences in absolute frequencies of T cells ( Figure 5A ). Absolute B cell frequencies, however, were significantly decreased in the NR group, as compared to HR and HCtrl ( Figure 5A ).",

            "text": "ESRD patients are at high risk of developing numerous infectious diseases. On the one hand, this is due to uremia-associated secondary immune deficiency. On the other hand, hemodialysis and frequent human blood products administration significantly increases contraction of viral diseases, especially hepatitis B and C, HIV, and further infections. Furthermore, infectious diseases in uremic patients show protracted course and higher chronification rates. 4, 5 Moreover, chronic viral infections pose a significant hurdle for kidney transplantation, the acknowledged therapeutic goal in ESRD hemodialysis patients. Thus, appropriate vaccination in ESRD patients is of vital importance to decrease morbidity and mortality in this patient cohort. 6 The post-vaccination anti-HBs titers are broadly accepted as protection correlates and, thus, reflect vaccination efficacy. [24] [25] [26] As compared to healthy populations, ESRD patients, as well as kidney transplant recipients, show lower vaccination efficacy against HBV. [7] [8] [9] [10] In posttransplant settings this is mostly due to, though not limited to, the immunosuppressive therapy. In ESRD patients, the underlying mechanisms are not exactly clear. More than 200 uremia associated metabolic products were described. However, the exact mechanisms or uremia-associated secondary immunosuppression are not properly defined. Among these, the direct cytotoxic effects on the bone marrow and hematopoiesis are broadly accepted. This leads to diminished absolute numbers of blood cell subsets in general and specifically immune cells (e.g., T and B cells). Thus, impaired T and B cell functions after vaccine application result in low vaccine-specific titers. [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] Furthermore, altered function of antigen-presenting cells due to hemodialysis procedure can also be responsible for the lower vaccination efficacy. 39 Further effects on CD4 + and CD8 + T cells and IL-8 plasma concentration after a single hemodialysis were reported. 40 Here, using multiparameter flow cytometry HBs-reactive T cells were functionally analyzed and quantified in a cross-sectional study in an ESRD dialysis cohort and healthy population. Based on post-vaccination titers, three groups of HR, LR, and NRs were identified. One of the findings of the current study is that even in case of a failed vaccination, HBs-reactive T cells could be clearly identified in the vast majority of NR vaccinees. Functional assessment of vaccine-reactive T cells based on cytokine production revealed no differences between Th subsets among the ESRD groups. There were no differences in IFN-g-producing Th1 cells, either among patients or healthy cohorts. However, there were significant differences in terms of vaccine-reactive Th cell secreting TNF-a and IL-2. These differences in prevalence of patients with detectable TNF-a, IL-2 single cytokine producers, and complete HBs-specific CD4 + T cells was not significantly different among study groups. However, functional analysis of HBV-vaccine reactive T cells revealed that in addition to absolute numbers of single producers, bi-functional TNF-a + IL-2 + HBs-reactive Th cells were significantly higher in HR and HCtrl groups, as compared to LRs and NRs. These data were further explored in correlation analysis revealing a correlation link between post-vaccination titers and frequencies and absolute numbers of HBs-specific Th cells (either irrespective of cytokine production or as TNF-a-and IL-2single and combined producers). Due to technical limitations, the post-vaccination titers >1,000 and <10 were assigned values of 1,001 and 9, correspondingly yielding highly statistical significance. If the absolute values of the titers outside measurement range were available, this would result in even higher statistical significance.",

Although the demonstration of the direct killing capacities was outside the scope of the study, the secretion of multiple cytokines by vaccine-reactive T cells suggests their killing functional potential as demonstrated in several previous works. 7, [30] [31] [32] [41] [42] [43] [44] TNF-a and IL-2 are secreted by T cells at early stages of immune response, as well as by antigen-reactive Th cells with advanced dif-ferentiation status (central memory Th cells as opposed to highly differentiated effector and Temra subsets). [45] [46] [47] The role of antigen-reactive Th cells with early differential status is of special interest. Recently, we showed that the absolute numbers of vaccine-specific central memory Th cells at baseline correlate with vaccination efficiency in settings of seasonal influenza vaccination. 44 Moreover, the diversity of the T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire of this subset further correlates with the post-vaccination titers. For this reason, it would be of interest to further analyze the differentiation status of HBs-specific T cells and their TCR repertoire composition in diseased and healthy subjects showing different vaccination outcomes in following studies.",

Therefore, IFN-g-based ELISPOT assay relying on a single cytokine as only a readout parameter might significantly underestimate frequencies of antigen-specific Th response. Thus, analyses employing numerous cytokines or combination with cytokine-independent markers of antigen-specific stimulation are superior in term of qualitative and quantitative analysis.",

However, we could not state any statistically significant correlation difference between IL-4-producing Th2 cells and post-vaccination titers. Th2 cells are known to promote B cell function and stimulate Ig class switch and antibody synthesis. The surprising fact is that in ESRD HR cohort, high post-vaccination titers could 100% reliability on the post-infection status. The lack of specific antibodies in patients recovered from certain infections (e.g., HBV, CMV, SARS-CoV-2), as well as in occult HBV infection, is also well-known. On the other hand, the applied flow-cytometry-based analysis of T cell antigen-reactivity is nowadays the most sensitive and specific for these purposes. In addition, the methodological approaches of negative stimulation control with subtraction of background noise from the specific stimulation decreases the chance of analysis bias. This approach is widely used in immunological studies assessing antigen-specific frequencies. Furthermore, applying the same methodology, we demonstrated previously HBsAg-reactive T cells despite the lack of HBs-specific antibodies. 7, 48 Moreover, circulating counterparts of follicular Th (cTfh) cells were recently identified among markers of successful vaccination. 48, 49 These cells at baseline and at the peak of vaccine-induced immune response were reduced in chronic kidney disease settings and were attributed to failed vaccination. Due to technical limitations, we could not consider the analysis of cTfh in our current analysis. Furthermore, our analysis was performed in a cross-sectional manner. So, no timedependent correlation between cellular and humoral immunity could be obtained. Therefore, further studies including a large marker panel and considering a prospective design will be required to identify correlates of efficient vaccination in ESRD patients preceding vaccine application or during early stages of vaccine-induced response.",

Present findings are in line with our previous study performed in kidney transplantation setting showing presence of HBs-reactive T cells in renal transplant recipients with failed antibody detection. 7 As previously reported, secondary immune deficiency in uremia patients proceeds in a graded pattern with B cell lineage being more susceptible than T cells. Indeed, our results showed decreased B cell numbers in NR group. To explore whether the B lymphopenia can be a cause for the failed vaccination efficacy in NR, we analyzed the general abil-ity of NR patients to produce Ig main classes and compared these values to HR and LR. Our data showed that the total Ig concentrations in NR group did not differ from other study cohorts. Although our data cannot completely exclude that the decreased B cell counts is accounted for the failed post vaccination titers, data on the general Ig production do not support such an assumption. It would be of interest to analyze further functional B cell capacities (e.g., T cell stimulatory capacities, cytokine secretory capacities), as well as after polyclonal or antigen-specific stimulation in future studies. Further elucidation of factors responsible for successful or failed vaccination should help adjusting current vaccine composition, as well as vaccination protocols in low response cohorts, both diseased and healthy. Last but not least, insights from the HBV-vaccination studies can be successfully transferred into further vaccination settings, as well as cell-based immune therapies.",
