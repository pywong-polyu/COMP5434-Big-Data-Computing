            "text": "Multiple myeloma (MM) is the second most frequent hematologic cancer worldwide. 1 In the United States, the incidence is 32,270 new cases per year, and more than 150,000 individuals live with myeloma in the Unites States. 2 Although MM is considered an uncommon cancer, incidence rates have increased by 126% between 1990 and 2016, with rates being two-to three-fold higher in African Americans than in Whites. 3, 4 It is a very heterogeneous disease with several clinical and genetic subtypes. Fortunately, progress has been made in MM care with 13 new therapies being developed in the past 15 years that have resulted in a significant improvement in survival. 5, 6 Despite the development of new therapies and increase in survival, MM remains incurable for the majority of patients. Accumulating reports have found small groups of patients that have maintained prolonged periods of remission being labeled as functionally cured and has led patients to ask if a cure is available to all. 7 Researchers of less common or rare diseases, including MM, often experience hurdles that slow or prevent progress, such as (1) small numbers of patient accrual to clinical trials and research studies, (2) shallow and isolated data sets, (3) high costs to answer research questions, and (4) lack of long-term follow-up data. [8] [9] [10] [11] To determine optimum treatment approaches, sequence of therapy, and ultimately curative approaches for all patients with MM, larger and more comprehensive data sets are needed. 12 This can be achieved through the patient's right to opt out of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act and a transfer of their siloed health data to a centralized patient-driven portal, leading to comprehensive longitudinal data sets, which can be accessed to accelerate research. 13 Several studies have demonstrated that online patient portals are crucial tools for rare disease research. 14 In early October 2018, HealthTree Cure Hub was released to all patients with MM. Here, we report how our HealthTree Cure Hub, a first-of-its-kind online patient portal, overcame four common research hurdles and accelerated MM research. ",

In 2016, with help from multiple stakeholders, we began the development of our online patient data portal. Following a patient-centered design approach, we sought the guidance of MM health care personnel (HCP), patients, and caregivers. Together, we thoroughly screened ideas (step 2) and developed a patient portal concept (step 3). After steps 1-3, we enrolled a subset of patients and HCP for testing a HealthTree Cure Hub Minimal Viable Product (step 4). We then finalized and released HealthTree Cure Hub in October 2018 (step 5; Fig 1) . Since its release, steps 1-5 have been iteratively repeated to continually improve the online patient portal.",

An example of its utility can be seen in the speed of patient accrual to research studies. In a recent German study, the researchers collected questionnaires from 552 patients with MM from a large myeloma center in Germany over the course of 3 years. 21 An identical study was offered through the HealthTree Cure Hub and accumulated questionnaires from 678 patients with MM in just 3 months. Because of the nature of our patient population, this study received research data from individuals with diverse social backgrounds, different races, and treated in different areas of the country, which made these data far more representative than other data collections. In our Multiple Myeloma and COVID-19 Study to assess the acute effects of the pandemic, we had 1,358 participants from April 2020 to August 2020. In February 2021, we released a follow-on study entitled Multiple Myeloma and COVID-19 Study Part 2 (in press) to assess the chronic effects of the pandemic. At the end of June 2021, we had 991 participants with 535 (54%) of these patients being return participants.

HealthTree Cure Hub's patient-centric design maximizes the depth of data collected by recording data across time instead of a single time point. Some health care data experts argue that EMRs are inadequate without the information provided by the patients themselves as patients are the only stakeholders capable of contributing deep and complete data. 22 Therefore, HealthTree Cure Hub practices a patient-input and medical consultant-verified approach to maximize the potential for population-based analyses and to draw reliable conclusions.

Ahlstrom was astonished to find that large corporations such as Google, Microsoft, and IBM attempted similar endeavors but came up short because they failed to engage the patient and lacked patient trust. In scenarios where patient portals are implemented, a recent government report has found that only about a third (30%) of patients use the portal; this is primarily because of a lack of value beyond the ability to access their health data. 32 Since patient registries and online portals are crucial tools for rare disease research, 14 Ahlstrom took matters into her own hands and developed a patient portal saturated with value and patient engagement. In addition to recently released features, providing educational courses through HealthTree University was a key feature that encouraged returned visits to the platform. HealthTree University was released around August 2019 and since its release, more than one third of all HealthTree Cure Hub patients return each month (Fig 5) . With the addition of the Twin Machine feature, patients were motivated to complete their patient profiles to find other patients with similar cancer diagnoses. Once a virtual MM twin is identified, the patient had the ability to view anonymized treatments and outcomes and had the possibility to connect via private chat with their twin. These features and others not discussed in the paper played a crucial role in promoting patients to join HealthTree Cure Hub, engage, and return on a regular basis.",

First, HealthTree Cure Hub has amassed a large database of patient health data that is easy to use and free to obtain. In a very short period, this database has enabled numerous publications and disseminated knowledge of MM research, thereby increasing awareness and possibly fostering future collaborations among different institutions that could lead to an even bigger database. Second, in contrast to other databases, HealthTree Cure Hub captured longitudinal data from a diverse patient population as opposed to a single time point and location. The first and second advantages gave way to a third advantage of a large sample size that provided sufficient statistical power. This is particularly important for rare disease research as statistical power poses a unique challenge, and thus, increasing the sample size can aid in drawing definitive statistically significant conclusions. 33 HealthTree Cure Hub did not exist 3 years ago, yet these capabilities are providing a research revolution in MM.",

This may be due to patient death, loss of interest, adverse events, change in physicians and locations, or other reasons. Minimizing this loss is possible by building relationships and engaging and supporting the patient community over the lifetime of their disease. 34 A number of measures previously mentioned were used to mitigate potential loss. For example, through the Myeloma Coach initiative, patients have found personalized peer-topeer support from a trained patient or caregiver known as a Myeloma Coach. With the help of a Myeloma Coach, patients are assisted through the HealthTree Cure Hub onboarding process, its capabilities, and welcomed into an MM community. Finally, we implemented measures to avoid lost-to-follow-up patients through multiple contact points such as e-mail and phone numbers for patients and the family of the patients.",

Importantly, individuals affected by this devastating disease can aid in accelerating research and find help independent of their living conditions, location, and socioeconomic status. All they need is internet access and a computer, tablet, or cell phone. The lessons learned and advantages gained from this initiative provide a template to explore a similar approach in other rare disease areas where barriers to progress exist.",
