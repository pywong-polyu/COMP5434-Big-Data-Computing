Pharmacy showed mixed interest in reclassification. Suggested improvements include increasing transparency, committee composition changes, encouraging a more evidence-based approach by the committee, more pharmacy undergraduate clinical training, and companies using scientific advisory meetings and submitting high quality applications.

To facilitate self-care, reclassification (or switching) of medicines from prescription to non-prescription has been taking place internationally for decades. This development has taken place despite variability in reclassification between countries [3] . The widened access to medicines from reclassification could benefit individuals, health funders and society. It could save time for patients, save health resources, empower patients, and enable more timely treatment of conditions [1, [4] [5] [6] [7] . It could also help to address undertreatment of conditions, aid public health initiatives (e.g. smoking cessation and vaccination) and increase the time available to doctors to attend to serious medical needs. However, reclassification also poses risks. Potential downsides of reclassification include adverse events, misuse or abuse of medicines, reduced opportunistic screening, and delayed diagnosis of important conditions [4, 6] . Strategies such as restrictions on availability (e.g. only through a pharmacy), label-warnings, pack size limitations, training for pharmacy staff, and screening tools have been developed to address potential risks. International comparative research can provide valuable insights to balance benefits and risks [8] .",

Nasal corticosteroids for allergy, triptans for migraine, antibiotic eye preparations for conjunctivitis, and dermal hydrocortisone for dermatitis exemplify medicines found to require a prescription in Austria but which have been reclassified elsewhere, in some cases at least 25 years ago. In contrast, the emergency contraceptive became prescription-free in Austria in 2009, six years before the usually less restrictive Germany, and approximately eight years after the United Kingdom (UK), and France [3, 9] . Research has explored reasons for such variability. The research has focused on the schedules of medicines [10, 11] and processes [12] [13] [14] [15] . Recent, broader perspectives [16] [17] [18] suggest that factors affecting reclassification activity include government support, population size and market exclusivity. Also influential are pharmacy-only or pharmacist-only schedules, pharmacy interest and a self-medication culture. The regulator and committee perspective, medical support or opposition, the cost and effort of making applications, funding for prescription and prescription co-payments, and certain individuals have a further impact.",

Enablers included the dual reclassification process and regulator openness to reclassification.

Important factors elsewhere of company capability for reclassification, and market exclusivity (delaying competitor entry post-reclassification) [23] , were unvoiced in Austria, probably because larger barriers discouraged companies.

The latter research also commented on the social partnership, with policy-makers being an exclusive group with low turnover and having a paternalistic relationship with the public whose citizens seldom participate in policy-making. Similarly, the classification committee members were also often long-standing, included no consumer voice, and reportedly did not entirely trust the public and pharmacy or use a benefit-risk approach. Furthermore, there was a lack of transparency and no public consultation. The lack of consumer voice at the committee and lack of public consultation is surprising given a long-standing intent in Europe to have public participation in health decision-making, and an increasingly people-centred approach [26] . However, most other European countries also have no consumer voice and no public consultation in reclassification of medicines [15] . Given that better outcomes are expected from patient and public involvement in pharmaceutical regulation, including increased transparency and trust and higher quality scientific committee opinions [26] , Austria and most European countries could address this area.

Similarly, Sweden has a small population size, and has been considered conservative [32] . However, Sweden reclassified omeprazole in 1999 (government-driven) [32] , and triptans in 2007 [33] . In 2009 it widened access to many medicines via non-pharmacy outlets [34] , and thus appears more progressive than Austria. A small population emerged as an important barrier to reclassification in Denmark, New Zealand, Australia and Singapore in earlier research, but flexibility and proactivity helped overcome this [17] . For example, the medicines regulator or committee have suggested reclassification candidates and/or the government has progressed widened access to medicines without a company application in Denmark [35] , New Zealand [36] , Singapore [17] , Sweden [32] and, more recently, Ireland [37, 38] .",

Brass and Hiatt [42] suggested improvements to US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) committees, including improved preparation for meetings; mandatory committee member training; enhanced committee member engagement and openness; changes in committee composition; and more informed committee discussion. Functionally and geographically isolated, reclassification committees could benefit from cross-pollination, e.g. through Chairs meeting regularly to share information of international relevance to reclassification. Research is needed into the optimal committee composition and processes for reclassification and how to maximise the quality of deliberations.",

New findings emerged from Austria including the enabling, dual process of reclassification in Austria, hindrance of the 'Sozialpartnerschaft', and expectation of slow or minimal change. Other barriers such as conservatism, medical opposition, low consumer self-care and limited market size seen elsewhere are particularly strong in Austria. The research reinforces the importance of the committee composition, reclassification process and culture of low selfsufficiency. Encouraging reclassification by addressing some barriers could provide more consistent availability of medicines to consumers (rather than relying on emergency supply), similar to other developed countries, help health funders manage increasing costs and reduce waiting times. These benefits may be particularly important in the current economic environment. For Austria, committee composition and process changes, and government support for self-care, would probably most enable further self-care options.",
