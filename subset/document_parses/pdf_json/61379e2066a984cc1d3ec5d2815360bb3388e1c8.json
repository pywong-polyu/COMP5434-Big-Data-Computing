The prefusion conformation is thought to be the optimal vaccine antigen, but previously described prefusion F proteins expressed poorly and were not well stabilized. Here, we use structures of hMPV F to guide the design of 42 variants containing stabilizing substitutions. Through combinatorial addition of disulfide bonds, cavity-filling substitutions, and improved electrostatic interactions, we describe a prefusion-stabilized F protein (DS-CavEs2) that expresses at 15 mg/L and has a melting temperature of 71.9\u00b0C. Crystal structures of two prefusion-stabilized hMPV F variants reveal that antigenic surfaces are largely unperturbed. Importantly, immunization of mice with DS-CavEs2 elicits significantly higher neutralizing antibody titers against hMPV A1 and B1 viruses than postfusion F. The improved properties of DS-CavEs2 will advance the development of hMPV vaccines and the isolation of therapeutic antibodies.",

Almost all humans are infected with hMPV by the age of five, but re-infections continue to be a burden throughout life 1 . However, infants, the elderly, and immunocompromised populations are at an increased risk of hospitalization with pneumonia and bronchiolitis 2 . Despite the disease burden that hMPV presents, there are no vaccines or therapeutics that have been approved for prevention or treatment. As a member of the Pneumoviridae family-recently elevated from a subfamily within Paramyxoviridae-hMPV is an enveloped negative-sense RNA virus. Viruses within this family encode three surface-expressed membrane proteins. For hMPV these are the small hydrophobic (SH), attachment (G), and fusion (F) proteins 3 .",

            "text": "As a class I viral fusion glycoprotein, hMPV F is first translated as a single polypeptide precursor (F 0 ). Proteolytic cleavage converts F 0 into disulfide-linked F 2 and F 1 subunits (Fig. 1a) . Three F 2 /F 1 heterodimers then associate into a metastable prefusion trimer that constitutes the active form of the protein. In cell culture, this proteolytic activation can be accomplished by the addition of trypsin, which cleaves the protein at a monobasic cleavage site 1, 4, 5 . During natural infection, hMPV F 0 is cleaved by trypsin-like extracellular serine proteases, such as TMPRSS2, although the extent to which this occurs in the producing cells versus target cells is not well defined 6 . The N-terminus of the mature F 1 subunit contains a hydrophobic sequence called the fusion peptide, which is situated within the internal cavity of the prefusion F trimer 7 . For other class I fusion proteins, such as human respiratory syncytial virus F (RSV F) and influenza hemagglutinin (HA), it has been shown that the trimer is labile and can transiently splay open, or breathe [8] [9] [10] . Recently, a human antibody targeting the trimer interface of hMPV F has been described, suggesting that prefusion hMPV F undergoes this transient opening in vivo 11 . To facilitate membrane fusion, the metastable prefusion F protein undergoes a substantial conformational change, liberating and extending the fusion peptide into the host-cell membrane. This unstable pre-hairpin intermediate collapses back onto itself to form a highly stable sixhelix bundle composed of a trimer of the N-terminal and C-terminal heptad repeats (HRA and HRB, respectively) in what is termed the postfusion conformation 12 . Given its critical role in viral entry, vaccine candidates for hMPV generally include the F protein.",

RSV F shares~33% sequence identity with hMPV F, and the two prefusion structures are highly similar 7, 17 . Various engineering strategies have been used to stabilize RSV F in its prefusion conformation, including the introduction of prolines, disulfide bonds, and cavity-filling substitutions [18] [19] [20] . Recently we used knowledge gained from RSV F studies to stabilize hMPV F in the prefusion conformation. First, the F 2 /F 1 cleavage site sequence 'RQSR' was substituted with a polybasic 'RRRR' sequence to enable efficient cleavage by furin-like proteases in the producing cell. Then, mimicking an RSV F stabilization strategy 19 , a proline was introduced into the helix-loophelix region in F 1 at the membrane-distal trimer apex. This engineering strategy allowed us to obtain a trimeric prefusion crystal structure of hMPV F, but the protein expressed poorly, suggesting further engineering was needed 7 . Additionally, our previous serum-depletion assays and murine immunization experiments indicated that there were no significant antigenic Fig. 1 Beneficial substitutions for hMPV F stabilization. a Schematic of the hMPV F ectodomain.

In contrast, prefusion RSV F elicits a more robust neutralizing antibody response than postfusion RSV F, and serum-depletion experiments demonstrated that most of the RSV-neutralizing activity in human sera binds exclusively to the prefusion conformation 21, 22 . These data suggested that a more stable prefusion hMPV F construct was needed to investigate these incongruent results.",

Two of the most successful variants, A107P and A113P, are both located within the fusion peptide and resulted in 2.9-and 1.9-fold expression increases, respectively, relative to the base construct (Fig. 2b) . The D461P substitution was designed to cap \u03b110 at HRB, which also led to a 1.8-fold increase in protein expression. Of note, A107P exhibited a rightward shift of the SEC peak relative to the base construct, suggesting a more compact trimer structure (Fig. 2b) .",

Similarly, L219K was designed to form electrostatic interactions with Glu80 (Fig. 1b) . These substitutions increased protein expression by 1.5-and 1.4fold, respectively (Fig. 2a, b) . Reduced internal charge repulsion has been successfully applied to stabilize RSV F, HIV-1 Env, and Ebola GP prefusion trimers 20, 24, 25 , and in hMPV F we found a negatively charged cluster of amino acids at the base of the trimer. Thus, the core-facing Glu453 was substituted with an isosteric glutamine to reduce charge repulsion (Fig. 1b) . Intriguingly, this variant not only exhibited a 1.9-fold increase in protein yield but also a noticeable rightward shift of the trimer peak during SEC, suggesting a more compact trimer conformation (Fig. 2c ). In addition, several cavity-filling variants showed beneficial effects. For instance, V231I increased protein expression by 2.7-fold ( Fig. 2a, b) .

For each pair, one cysteine is located in a region that moves during the prefusion-to-postfusion transition whereas the other cysteine is in a region that remains static (Fig. 1b) . The A116C/A338C disulfide improved thermostability but decreased expression compared to the base construct.

            "text": "Multi-substitution hMPV F variants. To explore the extent to which combinations of beneficial single substitutions have additive effects, we first generated three different variants containing either two disulfide bonds, one disulfide bond with one cavityfilling substitution, or one disulfide bond with one salt bridge. The substitution T365C/V463C was included in all three combinatorial variants due to its significant improvement in thermostability. All three variants (T365C/V463C/T127C/N153C, T365C/V463C/V231I, T365C/V463C/L219K) exhibited further 1.2-, 1.9-, and 1.2-fold increases in protein expression relative to the parental construct containing T365C/V463C, and the Tm of the variant containing two disulfide bonds increased 6.4\u00b0C relative to the base construct ( Fig. 3a, d) . We named this variant DSx2 and further added either L219K or V231I to it. Expression of DSx2/L219K and DSx2/V231I showed additional 1.1-and 1.6fold increases, respectively, compared to DSx2 (Fig. 3b ). Furthermore, the variant containing all beneficial substitutions (DSx2/L219K/V231I), exhibited an additional 1.8-fold increase compared to DSx2 and had a Tm of 60.7\u00b0C (Fig. 3d) . We renamed this variant DS-CavEs and added one more disulfide bond (L110C/N322C) on top of DS-CavEs as well as reverting H368N back to the wildtype His368, leading to the pentasubstituted variant MM-1H. Although protein expression was decreased by 25% relative to DS-CavEs, MM-1H showed an increased Tm (65.2\u00b0C) (Fig. 3c, d) . The enhanced thermostability due to the introduction of L110C/N322C is likely to be advantageous for use as a vaccine antigen. Due to the benefits shown by additional disulfide bonds, introduction of A140C/A147C was explored based on its favorable expression profile as a single substitution (Fig. 2b ). This construct, referred to as MM-4H, exhibited a minimal difference in expression yield and a Tm increase of 1.0\u00b0C (Fig. 3c, d) . Furthermore, we introduced an E453Q substitution to MM-4H to generate our best construct, named DS-CavEs2. Large-scale expression of DS-CavEs2 yielded 15 mg of prefusion-stabilized F from 1 L of FreeStyle 293-F cells (Fig. 3e) . Importantly, we demonstrated that the binding of DS-CavEs2 to MPE8-an antibody that preferentially recognizes the prefusion conformation 26 -is unaltered after 50\u00b0C incubation for 30 min (Fig. 3f) . The affinity of MPE8 Fab to DSx2 and DS-CavEs2 is similar to that of the hMPV F base construct, although it is much weaker than the affinity to RSV F DS-Cav1 (Supplementary Fig. 1 and Supplementary Table 2 ). Taken together, DS-CavEs2 enhances expression by 10-fold and exhibits high thermostability (Tm 71.8\u00b0C) (Fig. 3d) , indicating its potential for vaccine development.",

We determined a crystal structure of DSx2 complexed with antibody MPE8 to determine the effect of multiple substitutions on the conformation of hMPV F. The protein complex crystallized in space group P2 and a dataset was collected to a resolution of 2.2 \u00c5. After model building and ARTICLE NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-022-28931-3 refinement, the structure has an R work and R free of 21.7% and 23.9%, respectively (Supplementary Table 3 ). In comparison with our previously determined hMPV F structure (PDBID: 5WB0), DSx2 retained the prefusion conformation with an overall RMSD of 1.8 \u00c5 for 427 C\u03b1 residues ( Supplementary Fig. 2 ). The C-terminus of F 2 (residues 94-102) and the N-terminus of F 1 (residues 103-110) are unresolved due to the intrinsic flexibility of these regions. The C-terminus of F 1 is also not resolved, precluding the modeling of a segment of HRB and the foldon trimerization motif. The asymmetric unit consists of one F protomer and one Fab (Fig. 4a) . Surprisingly, the protein complex crystallized as a monomer and there was no crystallographic symmetry to complete the trimer. There is unambiguous electron density for the introduced disulfide bonds locking the \u03b23/\u03b24 hairpin of site V to \u03b12 (Cys127/Cys153) and \u03b110 within HRB to \u03b214 (Cys365/Cys463) ( Supplementary  Fig. 3 ). Because there is no well-established definition for antigenic sites of hMPV F, we thus use the site definitions from RSV F 27 to better describe the binding modality of the MPE8 antibody to hMPV F (Fig. 1b) . Similar to the previously determined MPE8bound RSV F structure (PDBID: 5U68) 26 , the heavy and light chains of MPE8 Fab contact residues in antigenic sites II, III, and V of hMPV F, demonstrating that the introduced disulfide bonds at site V have a negligible effect on this region of the structure ( Supplementary Fig. 4 ). L-CDR1 and L-CDR3 contact Ser232, Met234, and Thr236 in a helix-loop-helix region at antigenic site II via polar interactions (Fig. 4b) .

In the absence of MPE8, DS-CavEs2 retained the prefusion conformation, with an RMSD of 2.3 \u00c5 over 428 C\u03b1 atoms shared with PDBID: 5WB0 (Fig. 5a) . There are two F protomers in the asymmetric unit, and DS-CavEs2 also crystallized as a monomer rather than a trimer. Unambiguous electron density was observed for all disulfide bond substitutions (Cys127/Cys153, Cys140/Cys147, Cys110/Cys322, Cys365/Cys463) and the cavity-filling substitution (Ile231) (Supplementary Fig. 5 ). Although the electron density for the charge-balance designs L219K and E453Q was also interpretable, we could not validate the formation of the inter-protomer salt-bridge or the reduced charge repulsion at the trimer interface. Superposition of the membrane-distal half (sites II, V, and \u00d8) of DS-CavEs2 with our previous hMPV F structure (PDBID: 5WB0) revealed a substantial movement of antigenic site IV toward the central 3-fold axis (Fig. 5a) . Superposition of site IV from both structures demonstrated that there is rigid-body flexing at the center of the two long \u03b2 strands (\u03b21 and \u03b222) that connect the upper and lower halves of the F protein (Fig. 5a) . Similar to the DSx2 structure, the two disulfide-bond substitutions at site V did not alter the local conformation. In contrast, the Cys365/Cys463 substitution pulled the \u03b110 helix away from the central 3-fold axis and thus altered the downward trajectory of the HRB (Fig. 5a) . We were unable to obtain structures of trimeric hMPV F by crystallography, so we performed negative stain electron microscopy (nsEM) analysis on MPE8 complexed to DS-CavEs2. After 2D class averaging, multiple classes showed DS-CavEs2 as a wellfolded prefusion trimer bound by two or three MPE8 Fabs (~70% of the particles), demonstrating that DS-CavEs2 can adopt a trimeric conformation (Fig. 5b) .",

Recently, it was found that heat-treating preparations of postfusion hMPV F protein results in a more homogenous sample, likely by converting some residual prefusion F protein into the postfusion conformation 28 . We examined the binding of untreated or heat-treated (70\u00b0C for 10 min) postfusion F to a panel of monoclonal antibodies using ELISA 7 . Untreated postfusion F showed substantial binding to all four prefusionspecific antibodies ( Supplementary Fig. 6 ), but this binding was abolished by heat treatment. In contrast, both untreated and heattreated postfusion F bound equally well to antibodies that recognize epitopes present on both pre-and postfusion F (Supplementary Fig. 6) , indicating that the heat-treatment did not unfold the postfusion F protein trimers. We also performed nsEM on the heat-treated sample and observed golf-tee-like particles consistent with the postfusion conformation ( Supplementary  Fig. 7) . These findings suggest that heat treatment is necessary to fully convert hMPV F to a homogeneous postfusion population.",

Interestingly, all three prefusion-stabilized F constructs (base construct, DSx2 and DS-CavEs2) elicited 6-fold higher neutralizing antibody titers against hMPV A1 relative to the heat-treated postfusion F antigen (Fig. 6b) . Moreover, prefusion F immunized mice also generated significantly higher neutralizing antibody titers against hMPV B1 than postfusion F immunized mice (Fig. 6c) . We were also able to deplete the neutralization activity against A1 and B1 viruses from the sera of DS-CavEs2immunized mice by pretreating sera with prefusion-stabilized F proteins (Fig. 6d, e) . In contrast, pre-absorption with postfusion F proteins failed to substantially deplete the neutralization activity from the sera of DS-CavEs2-immunized mice, suggesting that DS-CavEs2 immunization elicited primarily prefusionspecific antibodies.

Among the most effective substitutions we identified were proline residues within the fusion peptide, such as A107P and A113P. These are similar to one of the proline substitutions (F817P) in our second-generation prefusion-stabilized SARS-CoV-2 spikes 31 , which substantially increased protein expression. In addition, we discovered that inter-protomer or inter-subunit salt bridges tend to be a more effective way to hold the trimer in a compact conformation than intra-protomer salt bridges. The L219K substitution in F 1 was designed to form a salt bridge with Glu80 in F 2 from the neighboring protomer, which is similar to the K588E-Lys492 design for HIV-1 Env that strengthens the interaction between gp41 and gp120 25 . Moreover, alleviating the charge repulsion at the base of hMPV F with the E453Q substitution generated a more compact trimer, as evidenced by the SEC elution profile (Fig. 2b) . The same strategy has been successfully used to stabilize RSV F and Ebola GP in the prefusion conformation 20, 24 .",

Both disulfide bonds restrain mobile regions to regions that remain static during the pre-to-postfusion transition. This approach has been successfully used for several class I viral fusion proteins 20, 29, 32 . In contrast, the T127C/N153C and A140C/A147C substitutions represent a different type of disulfide design strategy. Those disulfide bonds are placed in regions that undergo conformational changes, but they appear to stabilize the prefusion state by preventing refolding of HRA near the central helix. This approach also stabilized the parainfluenza virus 3 F protein 29 , suggesting that this type of disulfide design may be a general approach to stabilize class I viral fusion proteins.",

Given that we were able to visualize trimeric MPE8-bound DS-CavEs2 particles by nsEM (Fig. 5b) and that a heterogenous ligand binding model was the best fit for MPE8-hMPV F variant interactions (Supplementary Fig. 1 and Supplementary Table 2) , it is likely that hMPV F trimers are in equilibrium with dissociated monomers, even when fused to a trimerization motif. This is consistent with recent results demonstrating that several class I viral fusion proteins undergo trimer opening or breathing, and naturally occurring antibodies have been isolated that bind to the trimer interface of influenza HA and hMPV F [8] [9] [10] . Further studies, likely involving cryogenic electron tomography, will be needed to ascertain the native conformations of hMPV F on infectious virions.",

Our previous study showed little difference in the immunogenicity of prefusion and postfusion hMPV F proteins 7 , but those studies were performed with a 10 \u00b5g antigen dose and a postfusion F protein that we now know was contaminated with some amount of prefusion-like protein that had yet to adopt the postfusion conformation.

As a result, we do not think there is an immediate need to further stabilize hMPV F in a closed trimeric conformation to function as a vaccine candidate.

Each point represents an individual mouse (blue circle, postfusion; orange square, prefusion base construct, BaseCon; green triangle, DSx2; purple inverted triangle, DS-CavEs2). All box plots show mean as a plus sign, median as a central line,25 and 75% as lower and upper box limits, and minimum to maximum values as whiskers. Each experimental group was compared with the postfusion-immunized group using one-way ANOVA. * = p-value < 0.05, ** = p-value < 0.01. For b, postfusion vs. BaseCon, p = 0.0029; postfusion vs. DSx2, p = 0.0055; postfusion vs. DS-CavEs2, p = 0.0062. For c, postfusion vs. BaseCon, p = 0.0051; postfusion vs. DSx2, p = 0.0454; Postfusion vs. DS-CavEs2, p = 0.0169. d, e The sera from immunized mice were depleted with 1 \u03bcg of postfusion or DS-CavEs2 proteins prior to the analysis of serum neutralization titers against hMPV d A1 and e B1 viruses. Serum depletion groups were compared with the non-depletion group using one-way ANOVA. ns = no significant, * = p-value < 0.05, *** = p-value < 0.005. For d and postfusion immunized sera, non-depletion vs. postfusion, p = 0.0004; non-depletion vs. DS-CavEs2, p = 0.0179.
