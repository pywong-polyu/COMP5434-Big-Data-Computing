Based on the data obtained, various derived acoustical parameters viz, acoustic impedance (Z), adiabatic compressibility (\u03b2), intermolecular free length (L f ), free volume (V f ), Rao's constant (R), Wada's constant (W), partial molar volume (V \u0424 ), and hence apparent molar volume ( ) of the solute have been calculated. The results are discussed on the basis of the nature of solute-solvent interactions.",

            "text": "The choice of a suitable solvent is of primary scientific interest in order to obtain the required efficiency, selectivity and kinetics of a chemical process. The presence of hydrogen bonds in polar solvents has a significant effect on the dielectric, physicochemical and acoustic properties of mixtures. Alcohols are widely used as solvents in chemical and pharmaceutical industries, during extraction [6] [7] [8] , as dispersing agents for nanomaterials [9] [10] [11] [12] and for the synthesis of other organic compounds [13] [14] [15] [16] . A large number of studies devoted to alcohols and their mixtures at various temperatures and pressures have been carried out using densimetry, viscometry, spectroscopy, and computer chemistry [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] . In clinical medicine, undesirable drug-alcohol interactions are of common concern [30] . Heavy drinking and its combined effect with the antibiotics resulted into deadly incidental and intentional poisoning. When a new drug is synthesized, drug-alcohol interactions should be thoroughly studied [30, 31] . Azithromycin (Fig. 1) is a macrolide antibiotic similar in structure to erythromycin. Azithromycin has increased activity against Gram-negative bacteria compared with erythromycin, while maintaining activity against Gram-positive organisms. Azithromycin is characterized by good oral bioavailability, excellent tissue penetration and persistence, and long elimination half-lives [32] . Azithromycin demonstrates good results in vitro against Zika and Ebola viruses [33] and severe respiratory diseases. Recently, the evaluation of azithromycin as a drug for the COVID-19 therapy has started [34] [35] [36] [37] .",

The estimated uncertainity of ultrasonic velocity is within u(m) = \u00b11.09 m s -1 . The instrument has a built-in thermostat to maintain the temperature (\u00b10.1 K).

The product of density and ultrasonic velocity is the acoustic impedance (Z). Z increases gradually with increase in concentration and decreases with increase in temperature. This reflects the structure making action through strong hydrogen bonding [46] . Adiabatic compressibility (\u03b2) varies inversely to ultrasonic velocity and density (Eq. (2)). With the increase in the molality of the solution, \u03b2 decreases linearly at the studied temperature. Naik et al. also reported the same trend in the values of \u03b2 [1] . This indicates the closer packing of the molecules [47] . Intermolecular free length (L f ) is the indicator of the interactions between the solute and solvent due to association between the molecules through H-bonding. With the increase in the concentration, the decrease in the L f values reflects the strong solute-solvent interactions. From the Table 3 , it is observed that the value of V f increases with increase in the concen- The partial molar volume (V \u03d5 ) of the drug in ethanol, 1-propanol, and 1-butanol were calculated from the density measurements at the different temperatures by using Eq. (7). These V \u03d5 values are listed in Table 3 . By using the values of the partial molar volumes, the apparent molar volumes (V 0 \u03d5) of the drug were evaluated by using Masson's equation [48] given below: (8) When V \u03d5 are plotted against molality, the intercept on Y axis and slope gives the values of the apparent molar volume, V 0 \u03d5 and S m , respectively. The negative values of the S m listed in Table 4 confirm the drug-solvent interactions [2] .",

By using these values, acoustical parameters of the drug are calculated over the entire concentration range. The obtained data are interpreted in terms of molecular interactions between the drug and the alcohols. The negative values of the apparent molar volume of the solute confirmed the presence of strong H-bonding between the drug and alcohol [49] . The strength of H bonding increases with increase in the concentration and temperature. The extent intermolecular interactions is higher in 1-butanol than in other solvents. The temperature also play the major effect on these interactions.",
