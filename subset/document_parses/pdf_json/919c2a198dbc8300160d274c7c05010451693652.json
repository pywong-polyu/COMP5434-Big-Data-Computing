To the extent that health care providers can mitigate these concerns, provide resources to reduce risk and exposure, and plan for potentially increased levels of postpartum depression in the coming weeks and months, their patients will be better served. It is worth noting that as interest in home births increases, it warrants the attention of health care providers and medical societies to ensure patients are making choices that will result in optimal outcomes for themselves and their babies. Health care systems have an opportunity to adapt workflows and visitor policies, and particularly to leverage teleconferencing technology, to safely support patients through childbirth at a time when tradition in-person care increases risk of transmission. Technology-enabled modifications to care during delivery were reported to be satisfactory by nearly half of respondents who experienced these changes, though there is more work to be done to enhance these services to best serve our patients. Support for freestanding birth centers that could, appropriately managed, provide a welcoming alternative to in-hospital obstetric services could also cater to a patient population less inclined to receive their care in a traditional health care setting.",

According to research conducted by Deloitte in 2018, Medicaid beneficiaries own smartphones at similar rates to the general US adult population (7). Additional limitations include the presentation of the same survey items to respondents living in different regions of the country, impacted by the pandemic at different times. The demographic makeup of respondents is not representative of the US population, making the results only generalizable to patients with similar profiles to respondents.
