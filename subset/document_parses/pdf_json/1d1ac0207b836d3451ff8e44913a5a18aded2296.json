This study analyzes the effects of customer engagement and service evaluation on brand trust and customer behavioral intention based on 437 valid questionnaires from Chinese economy hotel companies using SPSS and AMOS. The components of customer engagement are subdivided into five dimensions: identification, enthusiasm, attention, absorption and interaction, and the impact of these five dimensions on brand trust in the COVID-19 is investigated. Finally, it verifies the influence of trust on customers' word-of-mouth (WOM) intention and customers' reuse intention. The results of this study not only enrich the research on customer engagement and service evaluation in marketing circles but also give some advice to hotel companies in the COVID-19 customer engagement and service evaluation that can enhance the trust of enterprises and promote the behavior intention of customers, which has certain practical reference value.",

In the case of the hotel industry, the impact of the epidemic on hotels has continued to be felt since the second quarter of 2020, highlighted by a simultaneous decline in average daily room rates and occupancy rates, challenging the profitability of hotels, with some experts predicting that the epidemic may result in hotels closing down to weather the crisis (Chen, 2020) . Due to the decrease in tourism travel and business mobility, economy hotels, which mainly serve the mass tourism travelers and small and medium-sized business travelers, are facing development difficulties. How economy hotels respond has become an important issue of concern for the industry and academia.",

As a result, the non-transactional behaviors of customers are also drawing more and more attention from enterprises. Companies are discovering that certain non-transactional behaviors of customers, such as positive word-of-mouth (WOM) and online reviews (Van Doorn et al., 2010) , can have a positive impact on the company. At the same time, companies are aware that non-transactional customer behavior can have serious consequences if not managed properly, and thus the concept of customer engagement has emerged.",

            "text": "In the past few years, the research on customer engagement has been diverse and complex. The individual perceived costs and benefits have an impact on customer engagement (Van Doorn et al., 2010) . Customer involvement and participation, such as customer involvement in the development of new products in a company, can have a positive effect on customer engagement (Vivek et al., 2014) . Zhang et al. (2021) showed that relationship quality had a positive effect on customer engagement. The drivers of customer engagement behavior are based on organizational support theory, so both perceived customer support and customer commitment are antecedent variables of customer engagement (Wang, 2020) . Customer engagement is positively influenced by interactivity and information quality (Islam et al., 2017) . Customer engagement is a special valuedriven relationship between customers and enterprises, which has a significant impact on the relationship between other customers and enterprises (Chan et al., 2014) . The value-driven relationship between enterprises and customers can create value for enterprises, and may also weaken value (Dessart et al., 2015) . It is a positive relationship between customer engagement and cognitive value (Algharabat et al., 2020) . Zameer et al. (2018) conducted an empirical study using m-commerce as an example and showed that mobile electronic service quality had a direct positive impact on customer engagement, while age had a moderating effect in the middle. Although scholars have examined specific aspects of customer engagement in different contexts in previous studies, this study integrates psychological and behavioral perspectives to show that customer engagement is a result of both psychological and behavioral aspects. Currently, few studies have measured the components of customer engagement in a multidimensional manner.",

Especially the Chinese people who are collectivism dominated in the multicultural social environment would be more sensitive to various environmental cues (Shobeiri et al., 2018; Jiao et al., 2021) . Secondly, within the S-O-R model, when consumers accept multisensory input from the external environment, such as COVID-19, the internal state of consumers will also affect their approach or avoidance actions (Eroglu et al., 2003) . Some researchers use S-O-R model to explain consumption behaviors stimulated by various external environments, and some predictions have been made by using S-O-R model Shen et al., 2021) .",

            "text": "In the past few years, the perception of \"customer engagement\" contains psychological, behavioral and integrated dimensions. The psychological dimension considers customer engagement as the mental state or mental process of both cognitive and emotional aspects of the customer toward the company. Bowden (2009) introduced the first cognitive and affective-based measurement dimensions from a biased psychological dimension. Hollebeek (2011) described three dimensions of customer engagement: cognitive, emotional and behavioral. A type of WOM transfer, recommendation, C2C interaction, blogging, writing reviews and other similar activities by customers to a brand or company are typical of the behavioral dimension. Van Doorn et al. (2010) clearly pointed out that customer engagement was a manifestation of behavior that contained two main aspects of recommendation and review; Vivek (2009) proposed that customer engagement could be measured in three dimensions: conscious participation, social interaction, and enthusiasm in the behavioral dimension. The integrated dimension, on the other hand, integrates psychological and behavioral perspectives, pointing out that customer engagement is the result of both psychological and behavioral aspects. Dwivedi (2015) expressed it in a more directional way, dividing it into three dimensions: vigor, dedication, absorption (Dwivedi, 2015) . Dessart et al. (2015) built on three dimensions that were further subdivided by subdividing the cognitive dimension into identification, absorption, and attention, the affective dimension into enthusiasm and enjoyment, and the behavioral dimension into interaction and learning. So et al. (2014) conceptualized customer engagement in the context of tourism branding into five dimensions enthusiasm, attention, absorption, interaction, and identification. In this study, from the psychological and behavioral multidimensional, and eventually referring to So et al. (2013) 's measurement dimensions, the customer engagement components are subdivided into five dimensions of identification, enthusiasm, attention, absorption, and interaction to study the impact of each customer engagement dimension on brand trust and consumer behavioral intention in the COVID-19. This method of measurement uses rooted theory and empirical testing to arrive at a relatively complete customer engagement measurement system that is consistent with management practice in the COVID-19 in China. The measurement system avoids the problem of crossover between variables in other scales, has a high degree of compatibility with the practice of economy hotels, and has a certain degree of operability. in the exploratory research of customer engagement behavior in virtual online brands confirmed that customer trust was the result variable of customer engagement. , while exploring the internal structure and formation system of customer engagement in online social media, think that customer engagement formed through five sub-processes: learning, sharing, advocating, socializing and co-development can have an impact on customer trust and customer commitment. Qiang et al. (2018) hold that customer trust refers to the subjective expectation of members of social groups for the potential value that knowledge sharing may bring, while customer engagement emphasizes the participation or input level of effective interaction among members in the process of knowledge dissemination and sharing. Therefore, in the process of knowledge interaction, members' input in cognition, emotion, and behavior can increase their trust in the community. Based on the above discussion, the following research hypotheses are put forward: H1: Customer engagement has a direct positive impact on brand trust.",

The concept of identification comes from the theory of social identification, which holds that self-concept consists of personal identification and consists of characteristics such as ability and interest (Ashforth and Mael, 1989) . People develop social identification by dividing themselves and others into different social groups. When a person thinks that he/she is intertwined with the characteristics of this group, a sense of identification will arise. From the consumer's point of view, identification is an individual's perception of organizational unity or belonging (Bhattacharya and Sen, 2003) . At the brand level, when consumers think that their self-image is consistent with the brand image, they will have an identification (Bagozzi and Dholakia, 2006) .

This emotional evaluation then becomes the tendency to guide the final brand selection and loyalty (Olsen, 2002) , thus forming a sequential chain effect of service quality, customer satisfaction, and brand loyalty in the development of loyalty. Thus, service quality has both direct and indirect effects on loyalty (through satisfaction) (Cronin et al., 2000; Sivadas and Baker-Prewitt, 2000; Lee et al., 2004; Petrick, 2004a; Eiselt and Marianov, 2009) . Hardin (2000) defines \"trust\" as giving one's interests to others without damaging one's interests, and emphasizes that trust is a variable of uniting organizations. The research results on hotel websites show that the influence of service quality on trust is obvious (Forgas et al., 2012) . Trust of enterprises in websites directly affects the service quality of personal information protection, transaction stability, information, and interactivity (Walczuch and Lundgren, 2004) . Thus, hypothesis 2a is as follows:",

From this perspective, the view of value reflects a reasonable trade-off between the cost and benefit of using a product or service (Zeithaml, 1988; Dodds et al., 1991; Grewal et al., 1998; Cronin et al., 2000; Anderson and Srinivasan, 2003; Petrick, 2004a) .

The purpose of relationship marketing is to establish, maintain and strengthen customer relations. To ensure benefits, trust is very important in the mutual benefit relationship between buyers and suppliers. To improve trust, it is emphasized that the value awareness of suppliers must be improved. There is a view that the higher consumers' perception of brand value, the higher their trust in the brand. Sultan et al. (2021) point out that when customers perceive the value of the products or services they consume, even if the value perception is not very high, customers will still have a high degree of trust in them. Kim et al. (2012) showed that consumers' perceived value of low-cost airlines will affect consumers' trust. Park and Jeon (2013) divided the perceived value of social media into functional value, emotional value, monetary value, information value, and social value, and confirmed that perceived value had a deliberate impact on trust. Kim et al. (2014) took the customers of private brand (PB) goods in large supermarkets as the object and studied the relationship between their perceived value of goods, brand trust, and purchase intention. To sum up, we can find that perceived value is an important variable that has an impact on trust. Thus, hypothesis 2b is as follows:",

From this point of view, one of the most widely used definitions of customer satisfaction indicates that satisfaction is the degree to which consumers think that owning or using services can arouse positive emotions (Rust and Oliver, 1994) .",

This positive relationship is based on the idea that consumers form satisfactory judgments about the products or brands they consume, which in turn explains why consumers are loyal to brands (Fullerton, 2005) . Based on this reasoning, empirical studies have produced evidence supporting the positive impact of customer satisfaction on attitudinal loyalty (Macintosh and Lockshin, 1997; Jones and Suh, 2000; Butcher et al., 2001; Bennett et al., 2005; Rauyruen and Miller, 2007; Russell-Bennett et al., 2007; Li and Petrick, 2008; Sun et al., 2008; Yuksel et al., 2010; Han et al., 2011) , behavioral loyalty (Yoon et al., 2010; Nam et al., 2011) , and compound loyalty (Shankar et al., 2003; Rauyruen and Miller, 2007; Kim, 2011) .

Theoretical reasoning about the relationship between trust and loyalty has identified three ways in which trust enhances an individual's commitment to relationships (Ganesan, 1994; Ganesan and Hess, 1997) . First of all, trust reduces the perceived risk level related to the opportunistic behavior of partners. Secondly, trust increases the confidence of partners that short-term inequalities will be solved for a long time. Finally, trust reduces the transaction cost in the exchange relationship. Consistent with this view, many studies have provided empirical evidence to show the contribution of trust to brand loyalty (Garbarino and Johnson, 1999; Chaudhuri and Holbrook, 2001; Sirdeshmukh et al., 2002; Ball et al., 2004; Chiou, 2004; Flavi\u00e1n et al., 2006; Matzler et al., 2008; Cheng et al., 2012) .

Ravald and Gr\u00f6nroos (1996) explain this relationship, arguing that when consumers are satisfied, they begin to feel safe with suppliers, which leads to increased trust in suppliers and supports and encourages customer loyalty. Therefore, a satisfactory experience strengthens consumers' trust in the organization. A highly satisfying experience cannot only convince consumers that trust in the organization is good, but also enhance that trust (Singh and Sirdeshmukh, 2000) . Increased trust, in turn, leads to a long-term commitment to a relationship (Morgan and Hunt, 1994; Doney and Cannon, 1997; Garbarino and Johnson, 1999) and thus affects consumer loyalty to the brand. A series of studies have provided strong support for this sequential relationship (Singh and Sirdeshmukh, 2000; Delgado-Ballester and Munuera-Alem\u00e1n, 2001; Shankar et al., 2003; Flavi\u00e1n et al., 2006; Caceres and Paparoidamis, 2007; Matzler et al., 2008; Van Doorn et al., 2010) .

Mainly reflected in price sensitivity of products/services, repurchase intention, WOM, etc. (Lounsbury and Polik, 1992) . Frazier et al. (1989) argue that behavior intention is based on the relationship between customers and service personnel. Behavior intention refers to the knowledge generated after enjoying services, which is a stage in the decision-making process of consumers. It can also be called the evaluation process of satisfaction or dissatisfaction after enjoying the service. Ajzen (1991) claims that behavior intention is an intermediate variable between personal attitude and behavior, a subjective possibility when trust and attitude are behaviorized, and also a subjective state of individuals.",

WOM communication is also crucial for enterprises because customers evaluate the products and others' feelings before choosing them (Belanche et al., 2020) . Consequently, customers' WOM is usually more attractive than other forms of communication (Dessart et al., 2018) . Some authors (Siqueira et al., 2019) identified the positive effect of customer experience on WOM behavior. Chattopadhyay and Laborie (2005) found that if customers were satisfied with the service experience, they recommended it to their friends and intended to experience it again. Recommendation or WOM communication has become one of the most effective marketing tools. Comments on social media can affect the financial performance of other brands (Pansari and Kumar, 2017) .",

            "text": "Over the past decade, customer engagement has been a pioneering study of brand loyalty and customer purchases (Prentice and Loureiro, 2017) . When a customer experiences a brand, a strong psychological connection is formed (Hapsari et al., 2016) , leading to customers' repeated purchases or use of products of the brand. Customer engagement may establish a long-term relationship with the brand (Vivek et al., 2012) . Previous studies have shown that the consumption experiences of customers have a significant impact on future repurchase behavior. Gounaris et al. (2007) highlighted that reuse intention is the core concept for maintaining the continuous relationship between brands and customers. In terms of reuse intention, the expected benefits come from experience mainly. Schivinski and Dabrowski (2014) also showed that customers' communication experience onbrand social media pages impacted brand purchase intention significantly. Experience has a positive effect on customer attitude, affecting customer satisfaction. Experienced customers tend to have better satisfaction and a more positive attitude than inexperienced customers (Cheng et al., 2012) . Previous studies have confirmed the influence of experience on the relationship between customer satisfaction and customer reuse intention (Khalifa and Liu, 2007) . Zhou et al. (2009) in the study of online purchasing behavior show that the service quality of websites has a stronger impact on trust and satisfaction than design quality. Trust has an impact on repurchase intention. Chu et al. (2012) think that for retail customers, the exploratory research on service quality, satisfaction, trust, and store loyalty shows that service quality has a positive impact on customer satisfaction and trust, and customer satisfaction and trust have an impact on customer loyalty. Chen and Chen (2010) showed that service quality had a positive impact on trust, and trust has an intermediary effect on repurchase intention. Chou et al. (2011) proved that service quality had a positive impact on customer satisfaction and trust, and customer satisfaction and trust had a positive impact on the repurchase. The research on the golf driving range also shows that trust has a positive impact on repurchase intention (Yu et al., 2005) . So many empirical studies show that trust affects repurchase intention. Based on the above research on brand trust and behavior intention, this study predicts the following: H3a: Brand trust has a direct positive impact on WOM intention. H3b: Brand trust has a direct positive impact on reuse intention.",

In their three-dimensional conceptualization of brand trust, Gurviez and Korchia (2003) consider that credibility, integrity, and benevolence relate to the paradigm of exchange. Credibility refers to an assessment of the partner's ability to meet the terms of the exchange, the expected performance, leading to functional expectations being achieved and needs satisfied. Integrity refers to the assignment of fair incentives to the partner relating to the fulfillment of its promises in terms of trade. These two facets are therefore mostly cognitive. Finally, benevolence focuses on sustainability and therefore the prospect of a less uncertain future, taking the consumer's interests into account and leading to conditions for a fair exchange. To summarize, this conceptualization of trust emphasizes not just its main characteristic of evaluation but also its sustainability over time.",

Each participant's Internet protocol address and demographic information were tracked and examined to ensure they submitted only one response. Questionnaires were administered to 470 customers who had used economy hotels, and finally, 437 questionnaires were used by setting the corresponding questionnaire validity as the censoring criteria, except for 33 questionnaires that were not suitable for this study. Table 1 summarizes the demographic characteristics of the participants. Among the valid data collected, 44.9% were male and 55.1% were female, and the majority (63.84%) of the participants were between 20 and 39 years of age. Most of the participants were employed (59.2%). Furthermore, 99.1% of the participants were generally educated to college level or above. And the majority (61.1%) of the participants were of medium economic level.",

First, the Harman one-way test was used to test for homoscedasticity. After unrotated factor analysis of the 40 items of the questionnaire, 11 factors with a characteristic root greater than 1 were obtained, and the first factor loading only accounted for 30.127% of the total loading, which was below the critical value level, indicating that this study was influenced by homoscedasticity within an acceptable range. The results of the reliability test showed that the overall Cronbach's alpha value was 0.924, the Cronbach's alpha value for each variable was higher than 0.920 (0.7), and the degree of the combination was greater than 0.860, which was higher than the minimum critical level of 0.6, so the scale had good reliability. Factor analysis was used to test the convergent validity, and the overall sample had a KMO test value of 0.921 and a spherical Bartlett's test chi-square value of 244459.242 (p < 0.001), which is suitable for factor analysis. Principal component analysis was used to test each construct, the maximum variance method was chosen for factor rotation, and the factor extraction method was eigenvalues greater than 1. The results showed that the factor loadings of the question items in the same construct were greater than 0.5, indicating that the convergent validity of the scale was good. Convergent validity was discriminated by the CR value of composite reliability and the average variance extracted (AVE), and the results showed that the criteria of composite reliability greater than 0.7 and AVE value greater than 0.5 were passed; Discriminant validity is to compare the individual mean-variance extracted values of the two constructs with the correlation coefficient between the two constructs, if the mean-variance extracted values of both constructs are greater than the squared correlation coefficients of the two construct variables, it means that there is good discriminant validity between the constructs, and the results show that the discriminant validity meets the requirements, i.e., the correlation coefficient matrix values are less than the diagonal AVE values. The correlation analysis matrices between the dimensions are shown in Tables 2, 3 . After testing the validity and reliability of the measurement, this study tests the hypothesis proposed by AMOS 24.0. Table 4 shows the model fitting index's actual and recommended values obtained after the original model is modified. These data prove that the model's appropriate index is better than the recommended threshold, showing that the model fits the data well.",

Gender has a considerable effect on reuse intention (\u03b2 = 0.096, p < 0.05), but has no significant effect on other latent variables. Generally speaking, men are more rational than women, so when choosing economy hotels, they tend to choose hotels that have been used and satisfied before. Women may be more emotional and like to try different hotels. Therefore, gender significantly impacts reuse intention. Finally, the education had a significant impact on WOM intention (\u03b2 = 0.136, p < 0.01) and reuse intention (\u03b2 = 0.088, p < 0.05) and had no significant impact on other latent variable.

This study provides a theoretically reasonable scale for marketing, which can be used by scholars to further expand their understanding of customer engagement. From a theoretical point of view, the Customer Participation Scale empirically studies the potentially related factors of customer participation, which provides a basis for building future knowledge of customer participation and expanding theoretical understanding of the concept of customer participation. For example, the most important factors affecting customer participation include attitude antecedents, such as brand attachment, brand commitment, and brand performance perception (Van Doorn et al., 2010) .

The development and verification of customer engagement scale provide a valuable tool for the operation of economy hotels during the epidemic period, which can effectively measure the contact with customer groups and develop marketing strategies reasonably. Managers can use this scale to collect insightful information. For example, they can evaluate their brand's performance in competition by comparing their customers to the customers of competing hotel brands. Moreover, because the scale developed in this study is a result measure, economy hotel managers can use it to verify various relationship marketing initiatives. Such insight will help managers determine whether they need to modify or change their marketing plan to achieve the desired goals.",

This result shows that when trying to develop customer engagement, economy hotel managers can focus on improving each of the five dimensions of customer engagement, with special emphasis on attention and interaction, because of their high factor load. For example, to increase attention, managers need to provide information that their customer base finds relevant and interesting (Celsi and Olson, 1988) . Interaction is also an important dimension of customer engagement. To increase customer interaction, hotels need to provide customer interaction opportunities and incentives to encourage customer participation, such as identification and reward programs (Sawhney et al., 2005) . Generally speaking, these actions help customers immerse themselves in the interactive experience with the brand, thus promoting their interaction with the brand. Although customer engagement is manifested beyond service transactions, excellent service, customer exciting functions, and good brand image may enhance customer enthusiasm for the brand (Bhote, 1995) . In establishing a strong customer brand identification, brand managers must create unique and clear logos expected by target customer groups, because logos allow sustainable product differentiation and help enhance customer brand identification (Baumgarth and Schmidt, 2010) .",

However, the information needs of active customers are based on their close connection with the brand, so they seek hotel information to satisfy their interest in the hotel. Therefore, the official website of the hotel provides participating customers with a more direct way to obtain information.",

However, by following a systematic and rigorous scale development process to verify customer engagement metrics, and by carefully considering the choice of reliable metrics of other structures tested in other empirical studies, the measurement errors of the scale are minimized. In addition, a thorough examination of the reliability and validity of the measurement structure produces strong evidence that the measurement scale has good psychological measurement characteristics, so it shows that the measurement error is not the main problem of this study.",
