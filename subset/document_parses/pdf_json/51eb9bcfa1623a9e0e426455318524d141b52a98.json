However, this usage has suffered from an important restriction: the function boundaries are assumed fixed and matched. Functional data exhibiting unmatched boundaries typically arise from dynamical systems with variable evolution rates such as COVID-19 infection rate curves associated with different geographical regions. In this case, it is more natural to model such data with sliding boundaries and use partial matching, i.e., only a part of a function is matched to another function. Here, we develop a comprehensive Riemannian framework that allows for partial matching, comparing, and clustering of functions under both phase variability and uncertain boundaries. We extend past work by: (1) Forming a joint action of the time-warping and time-scaling groups;",

This phenomenal interest in FDA stems in part from our growing ability to record, store, and transmit data streams that are indexed over near-continuous times. A number of books and papers, including the ones mentioned above, have highlighted clear benefits of analyzing these data streams as continuous functions rather than as discrete time-series. In FDA, one treats observed functions as elements of a function space, endows a metric structure on this space, and uses the geometry of this metric space to perform statistical analyses. The main challenges in the analysis of functional data come from the infinite dimensionality of function spaces, the contamination of data due to noise, and the presence of phase variability within the data. We highlight the last, and arguably most important, of these issues next.",

            "text": "Data with Phase Variability: Functional data displays an interesting phenomenon that makes it unique from the perspective of statistical analysis. Real life functional data often comes with phase variability, i.e., functions are often observed with perturbations or warpings of the time axis, resulting in the horizontal movements of peaks and valleys. In other words, noise in real data manifests itself as not only vertical (or additive) but also horizontal (or compositional), reflecting an inherent lack of temporal synchronization across functions. For example, in the case of COVID-19 infection rates, the high and low points for different regions occur at different times, implying different evolution rates of the virus cycle. Several papers [19] , [20] , [23] , [28] , [29] and a book [27] have documented and formally developed the concept of phase variability in functional data with the guidance that ignoring this phase variability leads to inflated variance in the data, loss of structures, and lack of power in hypothesis testing. Indeed these papers provide ways of separating phase and amplitude components (also termed alignment or registration of functions) and then performing either individualized or joint statistical analyses [14] , [17] , [23] , [27] , [30] . The proposed methods (for phaseamplitude separation) differ in their choices of metrics, tools for optimizations, and their definitions of phase; however, all of these papers share a fundamental shortcoming. They assume that the functions are fully observed over a common interval and moreover that the endpoints match perfectly across observations. In more mathematical terms, let interior of [0, T ] but also on the boundaries, the boundary matching assumption often breaks down and presents a major limitation to the current analysis. Sometimes one can assume that the left boundaries {f i (0)} are either synchronized or can be synchronized perhaps through a simple shift. However, the right boundaries are still variable, i.e., \u03b3 i (T ) = T . This situation arises, for example, in COVID-19 data where at the end of any observed interval, the infection rate curves for different regions are at different states of evolution. Another example of uncertain boundaries arises in censored data. Censoring is a process of randomly truncating the observation interval before the scheduled end is reached. In mathematical terms, such observations with uncertain right boundaries are given by {f i : [0, T i ] \u2192 R, i = 1, 2, . . . , n} with random end times T i \u2208 R + for each observation. There is a significant literature for analyzing right-censored functional data [4] , [7] , especially in survival analysis [13] , [16] , where the aim is to model censoring times as random variables and use the distribution of min(T, T i ) explicitly in the likelihood functions. However, the literature on censored data analysis does not consider the problem of phase variability and assumes that the functional data is fully registered at all time points as acquired. For this reason, the analysis naturally deteriorates when phase variability is present in the actual data. A commonly used, albeit naive, solution is to simply time scale (linearly) each observation so that they all have the same domain [0, T ]. However, this fails to address some deeper issues present in the data.",

The challenge here is to separate the phase from the amplitude when the right endpoints are no longer synchronized. In other words, we wish to align or register functions, essentially by matching their peaks and valleys inside the domain, while simultaneously placing their floating right boundaries correctly with respect to each other. Some researchers refer to this problem as that of elastic partial matching [6] , [8] , [25] . An example of this situation arises in the analysis of Berkeley growth curves [22] , where the start time of growth is birth but the end of the fixed 20 year observation period may fall at a different point of the growth cycle for different subjects due to individuals' differing biological clocks. Another example, mentioned earlier, involves incidence rates of the COVID-19 virus for different geographical locations where different cities/states/countries exhibit different rates of evolution in their incidence rates. The start time of the incidence can be assumed to be synchronized to the time of the first positive case, but, due to epidemiological and demographic factors, the pandemic evolution is certainly not well synchronized across regions. Different regions experience different growths and decline rates, and one needs to perform full registration to understand these patterns.",

Furthermore, the two functions have similar shapes except that f 1 is missing a piece relative to f 2 ; thus, f 1 can only be well matched with a part of f 2 , despite T 2 < T 1 .

Similar to the past works, we develop a framework where we represent both time-warping and time-scaling as group actions on a set of functions. Any two functions are compared by optimally time-warping their domains and varying the right boundaries using a fully automated optimization procedure. The key contribution here is a metric that is invariant to the joint action of these groups and that facilitates partial matching of curves. Additionally, we include an optional modification of this metric formulation that allows one to choose a scalar weight \u03bb that balances the dual goal of matching the interiors and matching the right boundaries; however, some of the metric properties are lost for values \u03bb = 1.",

For alignment of multiple functions, one exploits the fact that the minimum in Eqn. 1 is actually a proper distance on the quotient space L 2 /\u0393 T . Using this distance, one can define a mean function under this metric and then align the given functions to this mean using Eqn. 1.

We start by defining a finite sampling, or \"grid,\" on the time-scaling space H given by {h i (t) = a i t, i = 1, . . . , J}. Then, for each grid point i = 1, . . . , J, we fix the time-scaling group element as h i and solve for the optimal time-warping n i with the pivot b i = min(c 1 , c 2 /a i ). This value is the smaller of the two censoring points after the second function is time-scaled, which indicates the boundary of the common observation domain for both censored functions. One can solve for n i by first truncating the two functions to the common interval [0, b i ] and then performing dense elastic registration over this interval as described in Subsection 2.1. The time-warping function n i will be completed on the right with identity outside of this interval. One can perform this function registration using one of several approaches present in the literature. The most commonly used tool is the dynamic programming algorithm [27] , but one can also exploit the geometry of the space \u0393 bi to develop a BFGSbased gradient search [12] . The pair (n i , h i ) that yields the lowest value of the energy function E in Eqn. 3 defines the optimal diffeomorphism\u011d \u2208 G that best matches (c 2 , f 2 ) to (c 1 , f 1 ). Algorithm 1 describes the grid search algorithm for elastic partial matching of right-censored functions. The advantages of this algorithm are that: (1) It is relatively straightforward and uses mostly existing tools from the literature, and (2) It provides global solutions depending on the grid resolution. The disadvantage is that it is computationally expensive to solve for an optimal time-warping n i for each candidate time-scaling h i . A more computationally efficient solution is to perform a gradient search over the joint domains.",

This clustering method is Bayesian in nature and uses only a pairwise similarity matrix as input -not the functional data itself -to determine the optimal number of clusters and the cluster members in an MCMC approach. It assumes a Wishart prior on the similarity matrix and uses a variant of the Chinese Restaurant Process to help determine the number of clusters. In the associated clustering software there are several hyperparameters that must be set; however, we simply use all default settings provided in the code, with an initial number of clusters set to 3 for the simulated data and 10 for the real data, to collect our clustering results. Since the software takes as input a pairwise similarity matrix S instead of a distance/dissimilarity matrix D, we must compute a full pairwise dissimilarity matrix for all function pairs in the dataset and convert it to a pairwise similarity matrix before executing the clustering algorithm. Here, we use the conversion formula S ij = 1 \u2212 D ij / max{D} so that all entries of the similarity matrix S are scaled similarly between 0 and 1. Fig. 7 shows the result of the Bayesian clustering on the simulated dataset for each of the three methods: (a), (b), and (c). From left to right, we show the pairwise similarity matrices, the color-coded block diagonal class inclusion matrices, the function clusters with consistent color scheme, and the associated cluster means for each cluster. In order to form block diagonal matrices, the data set indices have been optimally permuted as a result of the clustering algorithm. One can see that the number of clusters (3) is correct only for the elastic partial matching method shown in row (c). Furthermore, the cluster labeling is 100% correct for this method. In both methods (b) and (c), the tiled cluster display shows functions that have been mutually aligned according to their respective alignment methods. For method (c), the mutual alignment is performed so that it iteratively seeks out the \"longest\" censored function and aligns each remaining function to it. For ease of visual display and the minimization of white-space, the vertical axis has been scaled in each cluster tile so that the maximum value is equal to the maximum function value in each cluster set. One can see that the functions align well within the clusters for our method, showcasing the three distinct classes.

As is evident from these numbers, the standard L 2 analysis leads to artificially inflated variances due to lack of alignment. The standard elastic analysis helps to bring down the variance within clusters by aligning peaks and valleys, but since the data is partially observed, the restriction of identical right endpoints still drives up the variance unnecessarily. The average cross-sectional variances are 12.7 \u00d7 10 \u22126 for method (a), 6.58 \u00d7 10 \u22126 for method (b), and 3.34 \u00d7 10 \u22126 for method (c).

Firstly, and perhaps most notably, there is a high degree of geographical correlation of cluster members; i.e. neighboring states/countries are typically more likely to be of the same cluster member than not. Although it seems as though this geographic correlation is higher with our method (c), there are clusters present in all 9 analyses that consist of only European countries and other clusters that consist of mostly US states. A second clear inference one can draw is that method (c) yields less clusters than the other two methods on average due to its relative invariance to partial observation. Since method (c) tends to eliminate clusters with redundant shapes, it preserves true virus trajectory features, and groups states/countries more accurately compared to methods (a) and (b). Noteworthy shape-based features that discriminate between clusters present themselves as the number and relative intensity of waves of virus transmission. For example, one cluster could exhibit a small hump followed by a rapidly rising large hump, or, in the case of the July 31 data, another cluster could exhibit an initial large hump and a subsequent tapering off with little or no second wave. Finally, we can see that method (c) yields the lowest within-class crosssectional variance on average per cluster, suggesting that these clusters are the tightest overall of the three methods. The mean value over all clusters for each of the three methods are the following: (a) 6.03 \u00d7 10 \u22126 , (b) 7.38 \u00d7 10 \u22126 , and (c) 5.82 \u00d7 10 \u22126 .",

According to Fig. 11 , the separability measure for the simulated data increases from left to right, with values of 0.879, 1.13, and 1.41 for methods (a), (b), and (c), respectively. Visually, one can see that the red and the blue densities become less overlapped as we move from the left to right panels. Contrarily with the COVID data, the separability values decrease from left to right, with values of 0.875, 0.695, and 0.626 for methods (a), (b), and (c), respectively. Visually, one can see that the red and blue densities overlap more and become more similar as we move from the left to right panels. This phenomenon provides evidence that states and countries have overall more similar virus trajectories with respect to method (c) than the other methods. Since the opposite effect is observed in simulated data, this phenomenon is due to the input data and not an artifact of the methodology used.",

In addition to exhibiting phase variability within the observation interval, real data often also exhibits boundary variability, and the past methods fail to account for such boundary issues. The proposed elastic partial matching method forms a joint action of time-warping and time-scaling groups and searches for an optimal nonlinear warping along with a sliding right boundary to best match functions. As seen through experiments on simulated and COVID-19 rate curves, this additional freedom allows for more natural alignments and tighter, more visually distinct clusters compared to past methods.",
