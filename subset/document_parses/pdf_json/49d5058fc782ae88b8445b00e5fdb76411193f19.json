However, little attention has been paid to an under-examined structural feature of help-seeking message diffusion, information diffusion depth, and how support-seeking messages can traverse vertically into social media networks to reach other users who are not directly connected to the help-seeker. Using the multilevel regression to analyze 705 help-seeking posts regarding COVID-19 on Sina Weibo, we examined sender, content, and environmental factors to investigate what makes help-seeking messages traverse deeply into social media networks. Results suggested that bandwagon cues, anger, instrumental appeal, and intermediate self-disclosure facilitate the diffusion depth of help-seeking messages. However, the effects of these factors were moderated by the epidemic severity. Implications of the findings on support-seeking behavior and narrative strategies on social media were also discussed.",

Medical care and attention could not meet demand. Many suspected COVID-19 patients could not get medical attention from the public health system, and many of them turned to social media for help. 3 They sought to gain admission to a hospital, obtain testing kits, or ask for emotional support, which is an unusual phenomenon in a society where public institutions are expected to hold a dominant role in mainland China's healthcare system. Using multilevel regression analysis, we found that a large number of followers, anger, instrumental need, intermediate self-disclosure, and situation severity facilitated the diffusion depth of the help-seeking message. Moreover, the severity of the situation can moderate the effects of the individual post and poster factors on the diffusion depth. The study contributed to the understanding of help-seeking information diffusion in two important ways: (1) analyzing one of the underexamined structural features of help-seeking information diffusion, information diffusion depth; and (2) differentiating the functions of the individual post and the poster in different situations.",

Nevertheless, the effectiveness of seeking help online is normally associated with the absolute number of end-users that a help-seeking message can reach, without considering the structural characteristics of information diffusion. Taking popularity data (e.g. the number of retweets) as a measurement of the outcome variable neglects that such end-user behaviors may mostly come from existing followers with a stronger relationship than non-followers. 3, 7 Since the majority of help seekers aim to maximize the collection of wide-ranging resources when using internet technologies, [8] [9] [10] how a help-seeking post can spread among distant but significant others with available resources should also be investigated.",

Zhang and her colleagues' study 11 found that highquality posts in an online discussion forum receive fewer replies in high-quality information environments relative to lower-quality ones because of the increased cognitive burden caused by processing high-quality information. Thus, factors that prompt the diffusion virality of a helpseeking post may not always produce a similar effect in other information environments. The inclusion of prior contextual factors into information diffusion models can deepen the understanding of the nuances in the diffusion of helpseeking messages on social media. To understand the dynamics of the diffusion of online help-seeking messages regarding COVID-19 in mainland China, our study examined the sender, content, and contextual factors that affect the diffusion depth of the help-seeking messages.

            "text": "Strong and weak ties when seeking help online For many people, the Internet has become one of their main avenues of seeking information and social support. Previous studies have found that in many circumstances, close ties (e.g. relatives, family members, and friends) help people cope with daily stressful or aversive situations (e.g. conflicts with relational partners) or individual distress (e.g. life-threatening illnesses). 12, 13 They can provide selfless, competent, and valuable support, regardless of whether it is troublesome or costly to offer a hand. 12, 14 However, seeking support from close ties has its inherent drawbacks. Suggestions from close others are normally homogeneous and similar to one's own thoughts. Support-seekers have difficulty obtaining diverse and alternative perspectives on overcoming problems. 12 Moreover, the intimate relations between help-seekers and supportgivers may make the latter less sensitive to maintaining an appropriate boundary with the former. Some advice from support-givers provided out of concern may be too emotional and compulsive, which is not helpful for supportseekers to exercise their agency and obtain a dispassionate analysis of their predicaments. [15] [16] [17] How to respond to these emotional but less effective suggestions and reciprocate close others for what help-seekers have been offered could be another challenge. 15, 16 Under these circumstances, compared with weak ties, seeking social support from strong ties may not be a preferential option.",

As a rare infectious disease crisis, there were very few professionals who have relevant information and know the transmission mechanisms, treatment plans, and preventative measures of COVID-19 at the initial phase. And the possibility that these professionals happen to be acquaintances of helpseekers during this initial phase is even lower. Secondly, in a large-scale health crisis, anyone could be a potential victim. Individuals with close ties to and live near those seeking help may face the difficulties themselves, such as limited access to medical resources and failing to be admitted by a hospital. As a result, individuals with close ties to those seeking help are also likely to be concerned about their own health, which makes it difficult for them to spare energy and effort to support others. Thus, close ties may not be effective in seeking help to tide over difficulties.",

For social networks, information is diffused among their users. 19, 20 Previous studies 7 have examined the topological properties or the effectiveness of information diffusion in terms of diffusion size, diffusion speed, diffusion breadth, and structural characteristics of diffusion networks. Diffusion size indicates the aggregated number of involved entities during the spread of information, [21] [22] [23] which can be quantified by the number of reposts a message receives. Diffusion size is often a proxy for popularity or breadth. 7 Diffusion speed refers to the time interval of the message's first diffusion when users repost or share the message. 19, [23] [24] [25] Diffusion breadth indicates the number of first-degree entities in the diffusion path. 19, 26 An important dimension of structural characteristics of diffusion networks is diffusion depth or the number of intermediaries or the number of steps in the diffusion chain, which can be measured by the longest geodesic distance between the original tweet and retweets. 7, 26, 27 Previous research on the diffusion of online help-seeking information has mainly focused on a narrow subset of the topological properties of information spread, such as the diffusion size and breadth, based on the number of retweets, comments, and likes that support-seekers have received. 3, 28 Little attention has been paid to examining the structural characteristics of the evolution of support-seeking networks (i.e. diffusion depth). A previous study 29 found that the tie strength between the information sender and receiver will decrease when the information diffusion depth increases. However, similar associations between tie strength and diffusion breadth/size may not hold true. On social media platforms, information typically traverses from original post to immediate followers, then to these followers' followers, and so on. Thus, the first-step sharing by those who directly disseminate the information from the source (i.e. breadth) are normally the followers who have more interactions and closer ties with the source than non-followers. 30 Moreover, the large number of retweets does not necessarily lead to close contact with weak ties. Luo et al.'s study 3 on help-seeking on social media found that the majority of those who share social media posts have followed the helpseekers' accounts before spreading their support-seeking messages. Therefore, diffusion depth is more appropriate to represent the extent of heterogeneity in the community that a help-seeking post has reached. Social media platforms' affordance on connecting weak-tie nodes makes them attractive for posting help-seeking messages. However, the factors that affect the diffusion depth of helpseeking messages are under-explored, especially on Chinese social media.",

Hence, it is essential to examine the implicit cues embedded in help-seeking messages generated by the support seekers, including the features of support seekers 3, 13, 34 and the typology and features of supportseeking messages. 3, 6, 35 Moreover, given that a post may traverse through different information environments since inception, it is also necessary to explore how such external environment factors affect the diffusion of help-seeking messages.",

Cues filtered-out theory suggests that communication media that are incapable of transmitting sufficient non-verbal or non-textual cues (i.e. \"low bandwidth\") can inhibit the formation of online social relationships. 36, 37 The lack of visible and verified cues in CMC forces people to process information and make judgments based on accessible contextual clues, such as the traits of information senders. 38 Social presence theory posits that the larger the number of personal and social context cues, the greater the perceived salience of online communicators. 9,39 People's perceptions of source cues allow them to extend the senders' appraisals to the content they have produced. Source cues such as the bandwagon and credibility cues have been found to significantly affect the diffusion size or breadth of a message in CMC. 40 Bandwagon cues suggest that people's appraisal of an information source can be influenced by the opinions of other peers. 38 Sources with larger peer followings and higher ratings possess greater bandwagon heuristics than those with fewer followers or lower ratings. Endorsement from the majority represents a good reputation and recognition of the source's past utterances and behaviors. 40 Lee and Sundar's study 41 found that bandwagon heuristics induce a larger number of retweets and trustworthiness when a Twitter post regarding health information comes from a source with a larger number of followers. In the field of social networks, the \"rich get richer\" principle indicates that a node gains new connections in proportion to the number of nodes it already owns. 42 A help-seeking post posted by a source with more followers may thus enjoy a head-start and attract a wider range of audiences. A large number of first-step retweets may increase the chances of the message traversing deeply into the weak-tie networks on social media.",

Moreover, Luo and colleagues 3 found that the greater the detail in shared biographical information (i.e. peripheral self-disclosure), the higher the possibility the posts would gain large numbers of reposts. The reduced uncertainty can generate positive impressions and facilitate more engaging interactions. Because biographical information is more tangible, it inhibits doubts about the authenticity of the information compared to subjective experience, thus generating positive impressions and facilitating more extensive interactions. 51, 52 We thus propose, H2: As compared to the intermediate self-disclosure, (a) help-seeking messages with peripheral self-disclosure is associated with higher diffusion depth, but (b) help-seeking messages without self-disclosure is associated with lower diffusion depth.",

Negativity implies problems, and the problematic situation will not be reversed without immediate action. 53 Moreover, different types of negative emotions can trigger various depths of information processing. Anger, for instance, is characterized by antagonism and heightened arousal. 55 Exposure to anger gives individuals a way to vent negative feelings and motivates them to change the current situation. Conversely, exposure to fear or sadness can give rise to escapist and defensive behaviors. 56, 57 Individuals may similarly learn to fear or feel sad about the circumstances in which they have been exposed to stress and pain, and subsequently undergo shallow information processing to avoid the discomfort caused by absorbing the upsetting information. 58 In the context of a health crisis, previous studies 55,59-61 found that anger-related posts are more influential and contagious and can trigger a larger number of reposts than those with sadness and positive emotions (e.g. gratitude).

Broadly, social support can be classified into two main types: emotional and instrumental support, which the former consists of feelings of love, trust, and encouragement, while the latter encompasses the provision of money, materials, information, or suggestions. 3 Coulson and colleagues' study 62 found that supportgivers are reluctant to spread information regarding requests for emotional support because support-givers often feel they are betraying the help-seekers' trust if they speak openly about the latter's pains and experiences. 62, 64 In the Chinese context, Luo et al.'s study 3 found that helpseeking messages with instrumental needs are more likely to be reposted than those with emotional needs. In a society that attaches great importance to pride or face (mianzi) and leaving positive impressions in others' minds, 65, 66 the Chinese are likely to publicly display weakness and helplessness as a last resort. Thus, help-seeking messages in the Chinese context are likely to be instrumental in nature.

Online interactions are dynamic and can change over time. Li and Feng 67 studied the contextual factor of information environment affects responses to a help-seeking message. They found that when existing comments are lengthy, emotional, and well-considered, similar high-quality responses are triggered. Moreover, such contextual information can confer help-seeking messages with legitimacy. When existing comments are generally supportive of what help seekers said they have suffered, it will reinforce other people's belief that the seeker is worthy of assistance. Conversely, when the authenticity of a help-seeking message is doubted in the responses of others, recipients would perceive seekers' requests as illegitimate and leave unconstructive messages. 68 In alignment with Li and Feng's 67 insights, another prior contextual factor, situational severity, can also play a similar role conferring legitimacy during a health crisis. Several studies 69,70 on newsframes of SARS in China found that increased epidemic severity increases news coverage of symptoms, protective measures, and medical resources. Wright and colleagues 6 call such information in serious situations \"evidence-based information,\" which can be cross-validated with the descriptions of help-seekers' and helps reduce the perceived uncertainty about the authenticity of help-seeking messages. Thus, recipients could be more likely to share the original post with more and more evidence of the situation greatly reducing their doubts. Additionally, many agenda-setting studies 71 have elucidated the importance of \"triggering events\" or \"contingent factors\" on influencing the relative salience of various issues and agendas. For instance, the conduct of parliamentary elections in Singapore during the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in crisis management becoming an important voting consideration, which was quite rare in past elections. 72 Thus, the salience of health-related help-seeking messages posted during the COVID-19 pandemic would be much higher than a non-epidemic or minor outbreak context, which has implications on the diffusion depth of such help-seeking messages. Hence, we propose:",

The count dependent variables can violate the assumptions of linear regression because they often display heteroscedasticity and non-normal conditional distributions of errors. Then, we conducted an overdispersion test by dividing the residual deviance by the degree of freedom. Overdispersion indicates that the variance of the count is greater than the mean of the count if the error term was really Poisson or binomial. If the quotient is greater than one, the model would violate the assumptions of the Poisson distribution. 82, 83 Given our quotient is 1.45, it indicates that the residual deviance is greater by 45% and there exists an overdispersion problem. Hence, multilevel regression models with negative binomial distributions were adopted for data analysis in this study.

In terms of the environment variable, we used grand mean centering to reduce the impact of multicollinearity. In Table 1 , all final models do not suggest multicollinearity issues (variance inflation factor (VIF)<5). To test the predictions, multilevel regression analysis with negative binomial distribution was conducted by R, using sender-, content-, and environment-specific variables as IVs, whereas the diffusion depth as the DV. Table 1 revealed how the source-, content-, and context-specific variables were incorporated into the multilevel regression model with the negative binomial distribution. Our negative binomial model generated a standard set of coefficients and an exponentiated set of coefficients that reflect incidence rate ratios (IRR). Negative binomial regression coefficient can be interpreted as follows: given all other independent variables are held constant, one unit change of an independent variable can lead to the change in the logs of expected counts of the dependent variable by the repressive regression coefficient. IRR indicates that the estimated rate ratio for a one-unit increase in the occurrence of an independent variable on the premise that other variables are held constant in the model. Model 1 showed that the bandwagon cues did significantly help (B = 0.14, IRR = 1.15, SE = 0.07, p < 0.05) enhance the depth of the transmission of support-seeking posts. IRR shows that a one-unit increase in the occurrence of the bandwagon cue would result in a 15% increase in the depth of repost. H1a was supported.

A one-unit increase in the occurrences of instrumental request and the mixture of instrumental and emotional requests would result in a 91% and 73% increase in the depth of repost. Therefore, H4b was supported. To compare the effect between instrumental and emotional requests, we changed the reference group into instrumental needs. The result illustrated that posts with emotional requests did not reveal a significant weakness (B = \u22120.23, IRR = 0.73, SE = 0.21, p > 0.05) in the vertical traversal. We thus rejected H4a.",

As for the type of requested support, posts with instrumental requests can induce a higher-level diffusion depth than the emotional and those without specific requests. Additionally, our results also revealed that help-seeking posts containing the subjective experiences about COVID-19 exhibited greater diffusion depth of reposts than those with mere biographical cues or without self-disclosure. The emotional factor also affected the vertical traversal of online help-seeking information.

A help-seeking post with high-arousal emotion and high-threshold request posted by a poster with many followers (i.e. \"head-start\" advantage 42 ) is conducive to reaching both homogeneous and heterogeneous communities. Conversely, credibility cues, and peripheral selfdisclosure, which normally facilitate diffusion breadth or size, did not facilitate the diffusion depth. One possible explanation could be social compensation. Earlier experimental studies 67, 68 have found that even if the profile of a support seeker does not have clear, credible, and identifiable cues, support givers tend to perceive the support seeker to be more trustworthy if there exist credible supporters and positive supporter comments. Social media can offer account information about users who reposted support seeking messages earlier (e.g. the status of verification, number of followers, comments on support seekers, etc.) to other users, which can serve as a credibility proxy to make up for the insufficient provision of personal information in the original post, thus facilitating diffusion depth. In contrast, intermediate selfdisclosure, such as personal symptoms, painful experiences, and the current mental status of victims, cannot be proxied. Only those who have experienced a disease personally can have a deeper comprehension of the disruption of COVID-19. Thus, contrary to previous studies on diffusion breadth and size, 3, 9, 51 intermediate self-disclosure is more effective than peripheral self-disclosure in increasing diffusion depth because the authenticity conferred by personal experience is unique and cannot be substituted by others.",

We further illustrated that credibility cues are not so conducive to the diffusion depth of help-seeking messages when adding the environment factor to the model. As shown in Figure 1 , the contrasting pattern revealed that posters without verification tags are more likely to achieve vertical traversal than verified sources under serious situations. Wright and colleagues 6 argued that the ever-increasing information and knowledge regarding the epidemic prevention and disease diagnosis released by mass media and governments during serious conditions could be used to validate the authenticity of the descriptions of support seekers. In this sense, when the user's descriptions are consistent with widely circulated health knowledge, the latter can become compensation information as well and help erase recipients' uncertainty due to the unverified and unknown status of the credibility of help-seekers. Thus, the original credibility cues become less important when circumstantial evidence has emerged.",

The radial patterns shown in Figures 2 and 3 suggested that a help-seeking post with intermediate self-disclosure and anger was more likely to be introduced to distant and significant supporters. In a critical situation, expressing painful experiences and constructive emotions is an effective way to show the severity and urgency of one's illness to the outside world, thus increasing the likelihood of preferential treatment. Conversely, a fearful post that aggravates a depressing situation and would be ignored at the first stage in emergent situations. As negativity avoidance theory 85, 86 suggests, individuals are inclined to avoid an unpleasant situation, especially when the situation is judged as likely to occur. In this sense, a worsening external information climate can prime recipients to prevent them from interacting with those messages that are depressive and escapist to prevent experiencing more unpleasant moods. However, negative avoidance theory may not hold true for the post with sadness. While sadness can trigger empathetic behaviors, extensive disclosure to fear elicits more self-concentrated examinations, and maladaptive behaviors, 55 thus avoiding interacting extensively with the victims. Taken together, helpseekers need to consider the external information environment when seeking help. A worsening situation would make it easier for ordinary help-seekers who show the severity of their personal suffering to reach distant others.",

Firstly, the sample posts that we retrieved were the sectional data rather than the real time, which may result in the loss of quite a number of posts deleted by help-seekers because they have received the assistance before our data collection. In addition, we only investigated the features of help-seekers and their posts that can elicit reposting behavior. However, whether help-seekers have gained satisfactory assistance still remains unknown. Future research could replicate the current study by going beyond the reposts to consider help-seekers' attitudes toward the support they have received. Thirdly, the social network environment and structure (e.g. modularity, density, and network diameter) may also influence the help-seeking information diffusion depth. We did not incorporate them into the current study, which should be accounted for in future studies.",

We used the heuristic-systematic model (HSM) as a framework to analyze the diffusion depth of help-seeking information in the context of the COVID-19 crisis in China. The findings indicate that sender, post content, and situational factors can impact the diffusion depth of information. In addition, the influence of these factors on information diffusion depth appears to vary with epidemic severity. Hence, in the context of health crisis, expressing suffering and their material demands with anger is an effective strategy for help-seeking posts to traverse more deeply into social media networks when the situation is relatively serious. Reaching close and weak ties is both important for widening the scope and enhancing the quality of resource collection. To obtain useful resources to the utmost extent in times of a nationwide health crisis, it is necessary for help-seekers to understand the driving factors of information diffusion size, breadth, and depth. Disassociating the depth of information diffusion from the strategies of seeking help on social media result in significant missed opportunities to reach a significant support giver.",

The timeframe was set to this period because the starting point was the time when Dr Nanshang Zhong confirmed the transmissibility of COVID-19 on China Central Television (CCTV). Also, the first Fang Cang makeshift hospital in Wuhan closed at the ending point, indicating that the epidemic was under control in mainland China. After removing duplicate and irrelevant posts (e.g. other types of pneumonia) via manual screening, our keyword search finally yielded 705 original Weibo posts that were reposted.",

Thus, H1b was rejected.The self-disclosure variable, which was categorized as peripheral, intermediate, and no self-disclosure, revealed that intermediate disclosure was essential to increase the depth of transmission. Taking the intermediate self-disclosure as the reference, posts with peripheral self-disclosure (B = \u22120.49, IRR = 0.46, SE = 0.23, p < 0.05) and no disclosure (B = \u22122.21, IRR = 0.12, SE = 0.20, p < 0.001) both illustrated significantly lower-level transmission. IRRs show that a one-unit increase of the presence of peripheral self-disclosure would result in a 54% decrease in the depth of repost. A one-unit increase in the presence of no self-disclosure would result in an 88% decrease in the depth of transmission. Hence, H2b was rejected, but H2a was supported.In terms of emotional factors, as compared to anger-related posts, fear-(B = \u22120.67, IRR = 0.56, SE = 0.21, p < 0.01) and sadness-related (B = \u22120.65, IRR = 0.54, SE = 0.21, p < 0.01) posts were less likely to diffuse in-depth. As shown in two IRRs, a one-unit increase in the presence of fear and sadness would result in a 44% and 46% decrease in the depth of repost, respectively, supporting H3a and H3b. In contrast, posts with positive emotions (B = \u22120.41, IRR = 0.64, SE = 0.26, p > 0.05) were not significantly less disadvantageous than angry posts in gaining more diffusion depth. We thus rejected H3c.",
