A country affected by a pandemic-level infection with a betterorganized producer has a greater possibility of being in a better position to avoid a decrease in production [9, 10] .

Impacts of the factors that contribute to contagion effects of volatility have no systematic patterns.

Furthermore, a clear understanding of intensity and variations in the transmission of volatility among markets could be crucial for international risk management in terms of global coverage strategies and asset allocation decision-making.

This finding is supported by [31] , where emerging market shocks have statistically and economically significant impacts on global equity markets. Such a fact confirms the assumption of the initial systemic importance of emerging market economies as drivers of global asset price developments.

In order to carry out the statistical modeling, first, the structural breakdown in time series associated with the stock market indexes are calculated. This breakdown is assumed as a consequence of the measures taken by the different countries to control the mentioned shock events. These measures can affect the stock market value of the companies belonging to the different indexes. Then, the change in the level suffered by each stock index is measured and, with these measurements, regression models are formulated allowing us to define the impact of various factors on the structural change of economies [24, 34, 35] .",

In order to do this determination, the Wald test is used. This test consists of evaluating changes in the coefficients of a regression model during the periods defined by an unknown breakdown date, combined with the test statistics calculated for each possible breakdown date in the sample [40, 41] . As mentioned, the period included for the analysis of each time series, described in Table 1 , corresponds to 1 July 2019 until 28 May 2020. In this period, we work with 234 observations for 48 countries and indexes detailed in Table 2 , which provides the estimated dates of structural breakdown using the Wald test. From Table 2 , note that the entire estimated structural breakdown corresponds to dates prior to 17 March 2020. However, there are three countries that appear atypical to this phenomenon, which are Iraq, SL, and Ukraine. Therefore, their structural breakdown can be caused due to a phenomenon other than the one studied in this paper [18] .",

These two specifications differ in that the average of the latter was considered when measuring structural change for three and six months of the evolution of the stock market indicators, respectively. The third and fourth specifications, named Models 3 and 4, consider as explanatory variables: (i) health index; (ii) the logarithm of the average country risk; (iii) the logarithm of its standard deviation; and (iv) an indicator of whether or not the country belongs to the OECD group. The fifth and sixth specifications, named Models 5 and 6, include as explanatory variables: (i) health index; (ii) the logarithm of average country risk; (iii) the logarithm of its standard deviation; (iv) an indicator of whether or not the country belongs to the OECD group; and (v) the logarithm of the GDP. Table 4 reports the results of regression analyses for Models 1-6 of the size of the structural jump. For all cases, the regressions present non-significant parameters. We proceed to analyze the heteroscedasticity effect of the interaction that the different variables in the model can generate. In order to do this, the Breusch-Pagan test is applied to evaluate the heteroscedasticity effect in the regression model. For all models, the null hypothesis of no heteroscedasticity is rejected. Therefore, the phenomenon is modeled considering the effect of the different variables within the variance of the linear model. Table 5 reports the linear regressions considering the effect of heteroscedasticity. As mentioned, Models 1 and 2 consider health index, logarithm of the average country risk and logarithm of the standard deviation of the same indicator of country risk. Similar to Table 2 , they differ in that the structural change measurement was considered as the average of the last three and six months of the evolution of the stock market indicators, respectively. They also incorporate the same variables when modeling the variance. As also mentioned, Models 3 and 4 consider the same explanatory variables of Models 1 and 2, in addition to an indicator of membership to the OECD group. Models 5 and 6 are similar to Models 4 and 5, with the difference that, in the variance modeling, the logarithm of GDP is included. Models 5 and 6 present significant parameters of the constant, whether or not they belong to the OECD group, the logarithm of Risk, logarithm of StdRisk, and Health. Models 2, 3 and 4 only present a high level of significance in the logarithm of StdRisk.",
