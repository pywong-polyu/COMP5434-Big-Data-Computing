To trace back the initial temporal change of SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus implicated in COVID-19, we study the limited genomic sequences that were available within the first couple of months of its spread. These samples were collected under varying circumstances and highlight wide variations in their genomic compositions. In this paper, we explore whether these variations characterize the initial temporal change of SARS-CoV-2 sequences. We observe that n-mer distributions in the SARS-CoV-2 samples, which were collected at an earlier period of time, predict its collection timeline with approximately 78% accuracy.",

In China, 11,791 cases were identified as infected with SARS-CoV-2, and 17,988 were suspected in 34 provinces as of January 31, 2020 [7] .

Identification of the molecular mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 is essential to prevent and control the disease. Through next generation sequencing, homology has been observed in the structure of the receptor-binding domain between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.

Many of these are in fact experimentally validated (PE=1 as marked in UniProt). Interestingly, out of the three proteins found, two (Replicase polyprotein 1a and 1ab) were aligned to many coronaviruses but the third one (spike glycoprotein) was aligned to human SARS coronavirus only. These proteins are now being studied in many recent studies to link mutations in them with the pathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2 [17] .

Total 36 sequences (17 samples from China, 5 samples from Japan, and 14 samples from USA) were obtained from the 87 genomic sequences of SARS-CoV-2 available in NCBI. These samples are gathered from multiple patients. For all these genomic sequences, we collected the geographical locations, sources of isolation, and months 1 genes/genomes http://covdb.microbiology.hku.hk 2 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/virus (accessed in February, 2020) of collection. The collection month of SARS-CoV-2 samples confirm the presence of the virus in the patients of China in December, 2019 and January, 2020, of USA in January, 2020, and of Japan in January, 2020. The exact collection dates are available for the samples of China (except one) and USA but not for Japan (see Supplementary Dataset 3). The sequences from Japan have recently been removed from NCBI but are still accessible 3 . An inquiry to the submitter regarding the reason of this removal has resulted in no reply so far. The sequences of other types of coronaviruses were collected from NCBI for phylogenetic analysis.",

The performance of the classification models are determined in terms of the five evaluation criteria, namely accuracy (= T P +T N T P +T N +F P +F N ), precision(= T P T P +F P ), recall (= T P T P +F N ), F1 score (= 2T P 2T P +F P +F N ), and AUC (area under ROC curve), where T P , T N , F P and F N stands for the number of true positives, true negatives, false positives and false negatives, respectively. FASTX (version 36.3.8h Aug, 2019) was used for multiple sequence alignment of DNA sequence of the reference genome of SARS-CoV-2 with the proteins in UnitProt [20]. The parameters for FASTX were: BL50 matrix (15:-5), open/ext: -10/-2, shift: -20, ktup: 2, Ejoin: 0.5 (0.0832), E-opt: 0.1 (0.0198) and width: 16. The fast family and domain predictions were also obtained using FASTX.The phylogenmetic tree was built using the tool embedded in NCBI Virus and further processed in the form of a consensus network using SplitsTree (version 5.0.0 alpha). The original input consisted of 269 taxa. The Consensus Network method[21] was used (with default options) so as to obtain 535 splits as compatible.",

This highlights a clear distinction of samples based on collection details(Fig. 3). The gradual mutations in SARS-CoV-2 sequences might be the reason of the said distinguishing pattern between the samples collected in December, 2019 and January, 2020. Unfortunately, with the newer (collected in March and April, 2020)) SARS-CoV-2 samples added to the list, this distinctive pattern of the corresponding sequences no more exists.
