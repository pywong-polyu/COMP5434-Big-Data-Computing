Explanations include higher rates of smoking, the presence of cognitive impairment, negligence of risks, confinement conditions in psychiatric wards and residential centers (especially in elderly populations), restrictions in regular outpatient evaluations, pharmacological treatment, and unequal access to healthcare settings (Seminog and Goldacre, 2013) . Additionally, this population could be more influenced by the emotional distress related to the pandemic outbreak and the confinement situation. This increased susceptibility may result in relapses or worsening of preexisting psychiatric conditions leading to hospitalization . Mental health home hospitalization care has been proposed as an alternative to address this problem, but this is not possible when COVID-19 involves serious respiratory symptoms (Garriga et al., 2020) . Very little has been published on COVID-19 patients with comorbid psychiatric disorders, which may make the treatment more challenging and potentially less effective (Sartorius, 2013) . In particular, the management of these patients regarding the psychopharmacological interactions with COVID-19 treatments has not been properly addressed. A recently published work by The University of Liverpool about pharmacological interactions with experimental COVID-19 treatments has been of aid for clinicians (Liverpool Drug Interactions Group, 2020) . The interactions are divided up into increased and decreased exposure (measured by blood levels of medications) and known, possible or conditional risk of QT prolongation and/or torsade de pointes (TdP) for each drug interaction (Liverpool Drug Interactions Group, 2020). However, real-world clinical scenarios are challenging and case-centered recommendations for psychiatric patients are lacking.",

Thus, stigma and the lack of training in psychopharmacology of medical teams involved in COVID-19 treatment might cause unequal access to COVID-19 drugs. This may lead to avoid the use of COVID-19 treatments in psychiatric patients for preventing interactions, or conversely to abrupt suspension of the psychopharmacological treatments when COVID-19 treatments are required.",

He was admitted for COVID-19 pneumonia with respiratory insufficiency and had been treated with lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) 400/100 mg/12 h, hydroxychloroquine 400 mg/24 h, azithromycin 250 mg/24 h, intravenous methylprednisolone 40 mg/24 h and interferon-\u03b2 8mU/24 h. Quetiapine had been interrupted since the first day of admission due to a high risk of pharmacological interactions. During weaning, with dose reduction of propofol and remifentanil and addition of dexmedetomidine 1000 mcg 6 ml/h intravenous perfusion, the patient presented with agitation, disorientation, and confusion. Intravenous haloperidol 7,5 mg/24 h was started, with close ECG monitoring, with a marked improvement of delirium.

The initial valproate level was 45 \u00b5g/mL within the therapeutic range (40.0-100.0 \u00b5g/mL) without adjustment of LPV/r dose, which can be increased around 40% with valproate (Liverpool Drug Interactions Group, 2020). The psychopharmacological treatment was maintained since the patient showed no acute psychiatric symptoms and the risk for major pharmacological interactions was low. Afterwards, meropenem and metronidazole were added due to bacteremia. After antibiotics were commenced there was a significant reduction in valproate levels to 10 \u00b5g/mL (below therapeutic range), likely due to an interaction with meropenem. However, the valproate dose was maintained due to the short treatment duration of meropenem (5 days). When meropenem was discontinued the levels of valproate returned to the therapeutic range. During his admission the patient remained well from a psychiatric perspective with no obvious symptoms, QTc prolongation or side-effects related to his medications.",

For instance, haloperidol is rarely associated with QTc prolongation but nonetheless there are reports of its association with TdP and, ziprasidone is usually associated with QTc prolongation but there are no cases of TdP (Hasnain and Vieweg, 2014) . Therefore, the inherent cardiac risk of each drug (independently of their QTc prolongation) as well as other cardiac risk factors, such as older-age, cardiovascular status, comorbid conditions, electrolyte disturbances and genetics, are usually required in addition to QTc prolongation for TdP to occur. In most cases, however, TdP does not occur until the QTc is over 660 ms. For this reason, psychopharmacological treatments with risk of cardiotoxic interactions should include an ECG evaluation with special attention to QTc interval, but always considering the presence of drug-inherent cardiac risks and co-existing cardiac risk factors (Shah et al., 2014) .",

Therefore, if the usual doses of psychotropic drugs taken by the patient are in the low-tomedian recommended levels, we do not suggest a dose change during COVID-19 drugs co-administration, but would advise ECG, clinical monitoring of adverse effects (i.e. extrapyramidal effects with antipsychotics, sedation with benzodiazepines, adrenergic or serotoninergic reactions with antidepressants) and monitoring of drug levels (if possible and/or required).
