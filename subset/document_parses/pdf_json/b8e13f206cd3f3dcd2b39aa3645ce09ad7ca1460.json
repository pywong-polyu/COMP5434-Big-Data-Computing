The Holland Sleep Disorders Questionnaire (HSDQ) is a self-assessment questionnaire that measures sleep problems and symptoms based on the six categories of sleep disorders described in the International Classification of Sleep Disorders-2 (ICSD-2). The aim of this study was at validating and assessing the psychometric properties of the HSDQ in Iranian adults. Method. The study was carried out as a methodological and validation work. The guidelines for translation and cultural adaptation of patient-reported outcome measures were followed for the translation and the cultural validation of the tool. To examine construct validity, exploratory factor analysis (EFA) with 216 participants and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) with 355 participants were used. As to the reliability, the test-retest method and, as to internal consistency, Cronbach's alpha were employed. Data analyses were done in SPSS-25 and LISREL-8. Results. The CFA and EFA results confirmed the tool with six factors and 31 items. The R 2 index of the model was 0.99, which indicated that 99% of changes in the dependent variable (adults' sleep problem) were attributed to the independent variable (the 31 items). In other words, 0.99 of the changes in the dependent variable were due to the independent variables. The main indices of CFA (\u03c7 2 /DF = 2:65, CFI = 0:91 NNFI/TLI = 0:92GFI = 0:81, REMSEA = 0:043, R 2 = 0:99) were acceptable. In addition, a correlation coefficient below 0.05 was considered as significant. Reliability of the tool based on internal correlation (Cronbach's alpha) was in the 0.701-0.924 range for the subscales and equal to 0.789 for the whole tool. Conclusion. In general, the results showed that the Farsi version of HSDQ (six factors and 31 items) had acceptable and applicable indices and it can be used as a valid tool in the Iranian society. The tool can be used as a reliable tool in different fields of medical sciences. cognitive, memory, and performance deficits) and also long-term health consequences (hypertension, dyslipidemia, cardiovascular disease, weight-related issues, and colorectal cancer) [4] .",

            "text": "Given the introduction about the problems, costs, and high prevalence of sleep disorders, one of the ways to collect useful information to attenuate and treat the disorders is epidemiological study. There is no valid and integrated tool for Iranian populations to measure sleep disorders. By searching for specific researches and texts related to sleep, we were convinced that there was no suitable tool to assess sleep problems in different categories as insomnia, CRSD, parasomnia, hypersomnia, RLS/PLMD, and SDB. Although the HSDQ is not based on an updated version of the classification of sleep disorders (ICSD-2), considering that the items match the Iranian culture and the classification of sleep disorders into six categories, it was used in this study, and along with cultural validation, the psychometric properties of the HSDQ in Iranian adult were also evaluated. Taking into account that HSDQ has proper items and categorizations and it is a simple and inexpensive tool to use, it can be a good option for the Iranian population. Therefore, the present study is an attempt to examine psychometric properties of HSDQ in the Iranian population.",

In this study, an electronic questionnaire was sent to 540 people (86 people via email and 454 people via WhatsApp), out of which only 248 returned and only 204 were usable. 2.4. Cultural Validity. The guidelines for translation and cultural adaptation of patient-reported outcome measures were followed for the translation and the cultural validation of the tool [21] . The tool was translated independently by two native speakers from English into Farsi. The results were examined by a panel of experts in the presence of the research team members, and one version was developed out of the two translations. Afterwards, the Farsi version of the tool was backward translated into English by two other translators. After revising the translation works, a cultural comparison process was performed. The two translations were compared with the original version to make sure of conceptual equivalence of the two translation works and the original version. Eventually, the final version of the translated tool was sent to the developer of the tool for confirmation. To examine cognitive equivalence, the final translated copy was provided to 10 adult persons with sleep disorder in the sleep disorder clinics in Kermanshah city to examine their ability to comprehend, interpret, and understand the items. The tool was revised based on the cognitive findings to make sure of cultural comparability. Eventually, the final translation was reviewed to spot and remove any grammar error or typos. ",

To explain the differences, cultural and traditional differences in the study populations, number of participants, and social condition (e.g., COVID-19 pandemic) that has created severed stresses in Iranian society is notable. At any rate, with a closer look at the item, it is clear that the concept of the item has consistency with the RLS/PLMD factor. Item 14 emphasizes the problems that the person will have in the next day due to ill health and factors such as fatigue, sleepiness, bad mood, poor concentration, memory problems, and lack of energy, in this regard, it can be emphasized that because some of sleep disorders, such as PLMD, occur in deep sleep, the individual is not aware that they have such a disorder. These cases are usually associated with morning symptoms such as drowsiness, fatigue, low mood, and concentration disorders [29] . People with PLMD may also experience sleep deprivation during [20] . However, in the present study, EFA was used to confirm the validity of the structure, followed by CFA. The CFA is widely used for confirming factors and items [31, 32] . To explain the results, it is notable that the responses of the participants to the items were affected by cultural condition, age, sleep hygiene, life style, and mental condition; therefore, these variables affect the response to all of items in scale.",
