Free energy of spread on a given day is defined equal to the natural logarithm of the number of infected cases. Dissipation of propagation is obtained using a postulated form of free energy built using thermodynamics of irreversible processes in analogy to isotherm wave propagation in solids and elastic damage behaviour of materials. The proposed expression of daily free energy rate leads to dissipation of propagation introducing a parameter quantifying measures taking by governments to restrict transmission. Entropy daily rate representing disorder produced in the initial system is also explicitly defined. In this context, a simple law of evolution of infected cases as function of time is given in an iterative form. The model predicts different effects on peak of infected cases Imax and epidemic period, including effects of population size N, effects of measures taking to restrict spread, effects of population density and effect of a parameter T similar to absolute temperature in thermodynamics. Different effects are presented first. The model is than applied to epidemic spread in Tunisia and compared with data registered since the report of the first confirmed case on Mar 2, 2020. It is shown that the low epidemic size in Tunisia is essentially due to a low population density and relatively strict restriction measures including lockdown and quarantine.",

Majority of epidemic transmission models are based on mathematical approaches dividing population in different interacting groups and assuming different rates of transmission between them. Solutions are conducted using integration of differential equations and principle of conservation (Kermack, W.O. and MC Kendrick, A.G., 1927) . Population is generally assumed as a closed system, the probabilistic formalism of transmission between individuals of different groups leads to a population size effect on epidemic size and epidemic period. Models that are more sophisticated include also Monte Carlo numerical simulations for stochastic models and more realistic epidemic networks.

Lattice models are representation of an ordered network in which epidemic transmission is similar to a wave like spread in regular grid representing connected individuals. Epidemic starts from an epicentre and spreads out in a roughly circular manner. Figure 1 illustrates an example in two dimensions. Lattice models are suitable for example for forest-fire models (Bak et al, 1990) where nodes represent trees that burn leaving empty sites. Keeling and Eames (2005) interpreted this representation as similar to epidemic transmission. This paper proposes, in this context of lattice representation, a law of propagation and dissipation using a formalism in analogy to elastic wave propagation and a size and temperature dependent elastic damage material model ((Ben Hassine et al (2019) and (Limam et al, 2014) .) The advantage of a formalism inspired from thermodynamics is that different effects emerge from principles. ",

It is clear that it decreases when distance d increases which means that when population density decreases.

This is justified by recent studies reporting that observed duration of viral shedding among survivors was between 8 days and 37 days Zhou et al (2020) . Evolution law of damage given by Equations (4, 6 and 7) is independent of population size and temperature and can be considered as an intrinsic property of virus spread. Its application with CR=1.15 ignoring entropy dissipative effect which means with T=0, leads to the trilinear curve presented in figure 2 (a and b) where population size will be reached with an epidemic period = 89 days for the considered example in Figure 2 . Figure 2(a) shows also the theoretical case of an ideal lockdown with CR=1 and T=0 which leads to an epidemic period of 40 days due to a recovering rate higher than infection rate in that case with an epidemic peak of 11200, reached on day 21 and independent of N. Evolution law of damage given by Equations (4, 6 and 7) are defined exclusively by C and CR and remain independent of population size. This evolution law of damage induces a decreasing of internal energy rate defined by Equation (9) which remains also independent of population size and temperature and equal to free energy rate when T=0. Effects of T and N are rather due to entropy production. Similar hypothesis was considered for a damage evolution law as an intrinsic characteristic of the material independent of specimens size and temperature see (Ben Hassine et al (2019) and (Limam et al, 2014) .",

It is worth mentioning that the considered free energy is choosing with an entropy rate \u2206 = (1 + ) , null before damage initiation ( = 0 for ( \u2264 21)) and always positive, which means that entropy increases according to the second law of thermodynamics and contributes to dissipate free energy of the virus. Theoretical free transmission in an ordered lattice case given by Equations (1) and (2) can be obtained when considering CR=C, and T=0, in analogy to absolute zero state in thermodynamics, where entropy effect vanishes. Parameter T should be understood as for example hygiene measures in the system which can be linked also to ultraviolet rays increasing with ambient temperature rising. When increased it contributes to increase entropy effect and consequently to decrease free energy rate and epidemic spread. This is in agreement with recent environment studies shown also through statistical analysis of data that transmission decreases as ambient temperature increases, see for example ((Prata et al, 2020) and ).",

The model reproduces data tendencies with Imax=912 and an epidemic period of 92 days, which means an epidemic spread end at the beginning of June if the same measures are maintained.
