            "text": "Background: Family physicians have played a unique clinical role during the COVID-19 pandemic. We hypothesized that the pandemic would be associated with significant deleterious effects on clinical activity, educational training, personal safety and well-being. Objective: We conducted a national survey to obtain preliminary data that would assist in future targeted data collection and subsequent evaluation of the impact of the pandemic on family medicine residents and teaching faculty. Methods: An anonymous online survey of residents and faculty was distributed via the Association of Family Medicine Residency Directors list serve between 5/21/2020 and 6/18/2020. Survey questions focused on clinical and educational activities, safety and well-being. Results: One hundred and fifty-three residents and 151 teaching faculty participated in the survey. Decreased clinical activity was noted by 81.5% of residents and 80.9% of faculty and the majority began conducting telehealth visits (97.9% of residents, 91.0% of faculty). Distance learning platforms were used by all residents (100%) and 39.6% noted an overall positive impact on their education. Higher levels of burnout did not significantly correlate with reassignment of clinical duties (residents P = 0.164; faculty P = 0.064). Residents who showed significantly higher burnout scores (P = 0.035) and a decline in levels of well-being (P = 0.031) were more likely to participate in institutional well-being support activities. Conclusions: Our preliminary data indicate that family medicine residents and teaching faculty were profoundly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Future studies can be directed by current findings with focus on mitigation factors in addressing globally disruptive events such as COVID-19.",

Since then, the USA has been severely impacted, with over 25 million confirmed cases and at least 430 000 deaths resulting in deleterious effects on our health care system (2). Family medicine faculty and resident physicians are uniquely poised to respond in a national pandemic given their broad training and expertise. However, this position also increases their vulnerability to stressors associated with frontline care and loss of educational opportunities.",

We performed a cross-sectional study of family medicine residents and faculty physicians between 5/21/2020 and 6/18/2020. An electronic survey was developed using the REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture) electronic data capture tools hosted at the University of Colorado School of Medicine (21) . The survey took an estimated 5-7 minutes to complete and contained up to 64 questions for residents and 49 for faculty, depending on branching logic. Survey items were developed using an iterative review process by a group of faculty medical educators and program directors. Basic demographic information collected is listed in Table  1 . Location of practice/training was later converted to geographic location as defined by United States Census regions (22) . The main domains of interest were (i) clinical activity including reassignment, (ii) changes in educational training and (iii) personal well-being and safety, including use of personal protective equipment (PPE). Measures of wellness were assessed with two tools: (i) the validated 7-item Physicians Well-Being Index (PWBI, MedEd Web Solutions, Mayo Clinic) and (ii) a non-proprietary single-item burnout question. A PWBI score of \u22655 for residents and \u22654 for faculty indicates greater distress and higher risk for adverse outcomes (23, 24) . The non-proprietary single-item burnout scale is scored using a fivecategory ordinal scale where burnout is defined as scoring \u22653 (25) .",

In addition, residents reported worrying more than faculty about personal and family health impacts from the pandemic, which is interesting considering their overall younger age and therefore lower risk profile. We suspect that the constant change and lack of personal control that is unique to residency training contributes to this discrepancy. Nevertheless, access to and training for proper use of PPE is crucial to the safety and education of learners (30) . One recent study found that primary care physicians form the largest subset of physician deaths from the COVID-19 pandemic (31) . The authors hypothesize that this may be due to more frequent interactions with asymptomatic patients and lack of adequate PPE compared with other frontline physicians (31). Our study found that those who did not feel safe with the PPE provided by their institution cited reuse as their major concern followed by inadequate availability of PPE. A recent study found that reuse or inadequate PPE were each associated with subsequent increased risk of COVID-19 infection in frontline health care workers (32) . We found that education on proper PPE use improves perceptions of safety. PPE education may also reduce the risk of subsequent infection due to selfcontamination during repeated application and removal (32) .",

To fully benefit, medical educators should incorporate reflective practice into their curricula which can encourage metacognition and deep introspection (34) . Unsurprisingly, the majority of residents and faculty reported finding stress relief from common activities like exercise, solitary time and time with loved ones. We suggest greater access to these self-care activities during work hours may be helpful not only during the pandemic, but long term. We uncovered a small but significant amount of reported tobacco, alcohol and other dangerous coping mechanisms. While our numbers are similar to the estimated 10-15% of physicians who will abuse drugs or alcohol at some point in their careers, we suspect that the pandemic represents a potential precipitant of these behaviours (35, 36) . Because physicians tend to present with more advanced addictive disease compared with non-physicians, we must remember to proactively address substance abuse issues that may precipitate from this pandemic (36) .",

            "text": "There were multiple limitations to our study. We anticipated it would be difficult to reach all potential respondents given the large number of family medicine trainees and faculty and the lack of a central accessible list serve. It is important to note, however, that our survey distribution method was intended to reach a wide and diverse population across the country with a goal to collect foundational data to direct future studies with higher response rates. To our knowledge and despite this challenge, our study is the largest on the impact of the pandemic on family medicine training. This approach, however, prohibited our ability to measure a true response rate or perform any responder versus non-responder comparisons (e.g. assess for response biases). Therefore, inference from our results across the entire family medicine population is uncertain. Furthermore, the cross-sectional nature of our study limits our ability to confirm the directionality of observed associations. In addition, while we received responses from a variety of geographical regions, it would be difficult to measure local geographic conditions as it could vary considerably even within the same state and may depend on patient demographics and comorbidities and available resources. However, these data can serve as hypothesis generating for future studies. Additionally, there was some bias in our survey distribution. Out of necessity, we relied on program directors to distribute the survey to their residents and faculty, and thus subjects may have felt pressure to participate. Some respondents may have been hesitant to report concerns about PPE or violations in work hours and/or supervision. We hoped to decrease these instances by making the survey completely anonymous and voluntary. Furthermore, we recognize the selection bias for residents or faculty who had strong feelings being more likely to respond. In addition, those who were especially adversely affected from burnout or unhealthy coping mechanisms may have been less likely to complete the survey. These two biases could lead to either an over or underestimate of these adverse impacts. Finally, as a potentially unique population, our data may not be generalizable to other health care practitioners outside of family medicine physicians.",
