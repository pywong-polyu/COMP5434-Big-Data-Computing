Scientists and environmental organizations have been looking for new ways to combat and control the air pollution, developing new solutions as technologies evolves. In the last decade, devices able to observe and maintain pollution levels have become more accessible and less expensive, and with the appearance of the Internet of Things (IoT), new approaches for combating pollution were born. The focus of the research presented in this paper was predicting behaviours regarding the air quality index using machine learning. Data were collected from one of the six atmospheric stations set in relevant areas of Bucharest, Romania, to validate our model. Several algorithms were proposed to study the evolution of temperature depending on the level of pollution and on several pollution factors. In the end, the results generated by the algorithms are presented considering the types of pollutants for two distinct periods. Prediction errors were highlighted by the RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) for each of the three machine learning algorithms used.",

The Air Quality Index (AQI) is based on the measuring of the liquid droplets and solid particles found in the air, which consists mostly of nitrogen dioxide (NO 2 ), ozone (O3), sulphur dioxide (SO 2 ) and carbon monoxide (CO). The key pollutants to calculate AQI are particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10), which determines the class of air quality level (goof, satisfactory, moderately, poor, very poor and severe), with a range from 0 to 500; each category of AQI has an impact on human health and the environment. Each air pollutant has its own source and effects; thus, managing to get an image of the air pollution sources in an area based on the highest-level polluting particle, for example, a high level of nitrogen dioxide, tells us that in that area fossil fuel burning occurs, possible due to heavy traffic in the area, etc. [2] .",

The specific index is classified from 1 to 6, each index having a PM2.5 concentration measured in \u00b5g/m 3 . More details about the concentration of this particle are showed in Table 1 .

[6] proposed refined models to predict the hourly air pollution concentration on the basis of meteorological data of previous days by formulating the prediction over 24 h as a multi-task learning (MTL) problem. Kalajdjieski et al. [7] evaluated four different architectures that utilize camera images to estimate the air pollution in big cities. Accurate air pollution prediction could be obtained by combining sensor data with camera images. Castelli et al. [8] demonstrated that SVR (Support Vector Regression) with an RBF (radial basis function) kernel could assure accurate predictions of hourly pollutant concentrations, such as PM2.5, NO 2 , SO 2 and carbon monoxide. Delavar et al.

Conversion from particle counts to PM mass is based on a theoretical model. The measured signal depends on a variety of parameters, such as particle shape, colour, density, humidity, refractive index and so on. [4] Other optical sensors can be used for the detection of carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide by measuring the absorption of infrared light.

First, we must decide which type of connection can be used for the sensor: node-wired or wireless. In the case of a wired connection, an ethernet or an optic fibre can make for a solid route of data transmission, the only impediment being the necessity of pulling long cables and connecting them to the system. If the space and architecture of the place where the sensor node is installed cannot offer the possibility of implementing such a wired connection, we can call for a wireless one. A wireless connection can be done mainly via Wi-Fi, which will require the presence of a router connected to the internet in the proximity of the sensor node, or the installation of a GSM (Global System for Mobiles) module with the sensor node, thus allowing the use of GSM antennas in the vicinity. The last option is probably the most suited one in urban areas since GSM antennas can be present everywhere [31, 32] .",

In order to validate the model, data were collected from one of the six atmospheric stations set in relevant areas of Bucharest. The use of sensors for data acquisition is essential for such a system that allows processing a substantial volume of data to make predictions. This aspect was highlighted by comparing the graphs obtained based on data from the two time periods, namely, March 2019-February 2020 and March 2020-February 2021. It was noted that if the data were insufficient for technical reasons that the authors could not solve (March 2019-February 2020), some complete results were not obtained, even if the same algorithm was used for the data processing.",
