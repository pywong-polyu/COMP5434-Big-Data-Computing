            "text": "In reviewing the literature, we found some research related to the evaluation of web accessibility in e-commerce sites, methods, and tools used in automatic inspection. Paz et al. (2021) argue the accessibility with which software products, including e-commerce stores, should be designed. It indicates that some countries apply laws and government policies that ensure accessibility to websites considering different skills and abilities. The study compared the results of five tools for inspecting the accessibility of e-commerce websites; the conclusions show that there are no 100% accessible sites. Xu (2020) compares the accessibility of e-commerce, considering compliance with web accessibility guidelines. As a case study, they applied the evaluation to 45 e-commerce websites. They used the Web Accessibility Assessment Tool (WAVE); the results revealed that websites with Accessible Rich Internet Applications (ARIA) attribute lower accessibility levels overall. They concluded that the accessibility of mature websites was higher than that of new websites with innovative products. Alshamari (2016) argues that many tools can help make a website accessible. The article explores some available tools that help designers and developers evaluate web accessibility. The research results indicate that navigation, readability, and timing are the most common accessibility issues when evaluating the accessibility of selected websites. Padure & Pribeanu (2020) argues that WAVE tool is a free tool provided by Web Accessibility In Mind (WebAIM). The authors indicate that WAVE offers a color-coding system: red for errors that need to be corrected urgently, green for correct lines but still need to be checked, and yellow for potential problems that need manual review. Oliveira, Afonso & Pinto (2020) infer that accessibility is fundamental in the democratization of technologies, so applying the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG 2.1) is essential. The accessibility evaluation was applied to three websites operating in Portugal, considering the three best-positioned retailers' ranking corresponding to the SimilarWeb. The results obtained established a collection of suggestions to increase the accessibility of websites aimed at e-commerce. Our study differs from Oliveira, Afonso & Pinto (2020) and Xu (2020) because the total sample is taken from ecommerceDB, which presents the e-commerce websites related to market trends and a ranking of the leading e-commerce stores. Our evaluation applied a new method based on the methodology (WCAG-EM) 1.0. In addition, the WAVE evaluation tool is based on version 3.1.6, updated as of October 14, 2021, which includes the plugin component that allows evaluating websites that require authentication. We, therefore, propose 10 recommendations to improve the accessibility of the websites listed in the discussion section.",

            "text": "The evaluation of the accessibility of e-commerce stores was carried out with the WAVE automatic review tool. Rich Internet applications tend to dynamically update the Document Object Model (DOM) structure, which is why the method used by WAVE to analyze the rendered DOM of pages uses heuristics and logic to detect end-user accessibility barriers considering WCAG 2.1 (World Wide Web Consortium, 2018). All automatic review tools, including WAVE, have limitations; they can detect barriers in 35% of possible compliance failures (WebAIM, 2021). The method applied in evaluating the accessibility of e-commerce stores was based on a modification of the World Wide Web Consortium (2014) WCAG-EM 1.0; our method consists of an eight-phase process detailed in Fig. 2 . Table 2 presents the data obtained from the accessibility evaluation of e-commerce websites with WAVE. It contains the number of WCAG 2.1 compliance failures that may affect specific users. Web developers should correct the barriers identified in the evaluation to make the e-commerce site accessible and inclusive. The contrast errors found in this study are related to the text that violates WCAG 2.1 contrast requirements. The term alerts are related to elements that may cause accessibility problems; in this case, the evaluator is the one who decides the impact of the accessibility of the website. Features imply that elements can improve accessibility when implemented correctly. Structural elements are related to some title of a web page, indicating that it has been marked as a top-level title or related to several milestones. Finally, the ARIA element presents information about accessibility for people with disabilities; in such a way, it influences accessibility when misused. Figure 3 shows the number of e-commerce sites by country, taken as a sample for the accessibility evaluation. The most significant number of e-commerce sites evaluated corresponds to the United States, with 24 sites representing 48% of the total, followed by the United Kingdom, with eight sites representing 16%. With six e-commerce sites, Greater China accounts for 12% in third place. Next, Germany, with three sites, accounts for 6%, followed by France and Russia, with two sites each, representing 8% of the total. Lastly, Brazil, Canada, Italy, Japan and Spain, with one e-commerce site, account for 10%. Figure 4 shows two categories of barriers, warning and serious barriers; the most significant warning barriers are ARIA, Structural Elements, Features and Alerts. These barriers do not affect accessibility to a high degree, and correcting them is unnecessary. The serious barriers with a high number are Contrast Errors with 1,721 barriers, representing 7.4% (pink bars) and Errors with 1,229, corresponding to 5.3% (sky blue bars), which must be corrected urgently for e-commerce sites to reach an acceptable level of accessibility. ARIA attributes (World Wide Web Consortium, 2018) add semantic information to the elements of a website, specifically for properties that help to inform: (1) The state of an element of the graphical interface. (2) The content of a section Table 3 summarizes the barriers identified during the evaluation of the e-commerce sites with WAVE. Table 3 includes the barriers, success criteria, level, principle, and total barriers of the 50 e-commerce websites assessed. Table 3 comprises the success criteria composed of three numbers; the first is associated with the accessibility principle, the second to the guideline, and the third to the success criteria related to the accessibility barrier. Figure 5 shows a synopsis of the accessibility principles recognized in the assessment of e-commerce websites. The most neglected accessibility principle is perceivable, representing 83.1% of the total, followed by operable with 13.7%, in third place is robust with 1.7%, and finally, understandable with 1.5%. Figure 6 summarizes the barriers identified in the accessibility evaluation. The most affected accessibility barrier corresponds to Contrast with 54.4%, followed by Non-text Content, representing 25.6%, in third place is Link purpose, representing 11.6% of the total. The rest of the barriers, such as info and relationships, name, role, value, headings and labels, labels or instructions, bypass blocks, keyboard, the language of page and error identification, correspond to values lower than 3.1%. Figure 7 presents the e-commerce sites and the level of web accessibility; among the top ten most accessible websites according to this analysis with WAVE, we have Sainsbury's Supermarkets, Walmart, Target Corporation, Macy's, IKEA, H&M Hennes, Chewy, Kroger, QVC, and Nike.",

(5) Add captions to graphics: especially those whose description does not conform to the \"alt\" attribute. The use of the \"Alt\" attribute, called \"alternative text,\" is essential for blind users who use screen readers. (6) Avoid using red to highlight important things; it would be fine if no people had color blindness problems. A good accessibility option is to use more giant letters or representative icons.

We recommend performing evaluations with heuristic methods based on WCAG 2.1 (World Wide Web Consortium, 2018) accessibility barriers and automated reviews with users with different disabilities. We found that 55.8% of the websites reach the \"AA\" level suggested by WCAG 2.1. We found a low positive correlation between the rating of e-commerce websites and accessibility barriers according to Spearman's Rho of 0.329. The study revealed that 25.6% of e-commerce websites present images of the products they offer and that 54.4% of the sites present contrast problems related to the perception principle, which need to be solved urgently to make the sites more inclusive. Finally, we suggest that business people, governments, and academia work in multidisciplinary teams to generate laws and regulations related to web accessibility that would benefit all users, especially those with disabilities.",
