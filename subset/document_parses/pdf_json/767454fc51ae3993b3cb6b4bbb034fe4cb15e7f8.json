Previously reported COVID-19 animal models need to be established under a high biosafety level condition for the utilization of live SARS-CoV-2, which greatly limits its application in routine research. Here, we generate a mouse model of COVID-19 under a general laboratory condition that captures multiple characteristics of SARS-CoV-2-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) observed in humans. Briefly, human ACE2-transgenic (hACE2) mice were intratracheally instilled with the formaldehyde-inactivated SARS-CoV-2, resulting in a rapid weight loss and detrimental changes in lung structure and function. The pulmonary pathologic changes were characterized by diffuse alveolar damage with pulmonary consolidation, hemorrhage, necrotic debris, and hyaline membrane formation. The production of fatal cytokines (IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1, and IL-6) and the infiltration of activated neutrophils, inflammatory monocyte-macrophages, and T cells in the lung were also determined, suggesting the activation of an adaptive immune response. Therapeutic strategies, such as dexamethasone or passive antibody therapy, could effectively ameliorate the disease progression in this model. Therefore, the established mouse model for SARS-CoV-2-induced ARDS in the current study may provide a robust tool for researchers in the standard open laboratory to investigate the pathological mechanisms or develop new therapeutic strategies for COVID-19 and ARDS.",

Importantly, proper models are vital for accelerating the development of vaccines and antiviral drugs. To date, several animal species, including nonhuman primates, hamsters, mice, ferrets, civet cats, and rabbits, have been well utilized in the studies for SARS-CoV-2; 5 however, these models could not fully recapitulate the characteristics of severe lung disease observed in humans. 5 SARS-CoV-2 utilizes the cellular receptor human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) to enter the host cells, but not the mouse ACE2 (mACE2). 6 Thus, infection of laboratory strains of mice requires adapted viruses by serial passage, 7, 8 or introducing hACE2 into mice via adenoviral/ adenoviral-associated vectors, 9 mouse ACE2 promoter, 10 or heterologous gene promoters. 11 At present, various categories of vaccines, such as mRNA vaccines or recombinant protein vaccines, 7,12-16 and small molecular drugs for COVID-19 are still under evaluation in mouse models, 17 however, most of the animal models need to be performed under high biosafety level conditions. Here, we propose that if the mouse COVID-19 model could be established under a normal laboratory condition and fully recapitulate the severe pathological phenotypes would be helpful for the preclinical evaluation of vaccines and drugs.",

The pulmonary diseases induced by FA-S in hACE2 mice were highly like the clinical symptoms and pathological changes of COVID-19 patients with ARDS. Moreover, the FA-S virus could active the adaptive immune response which occurs in late SARS-CoV-2 infection. We selected dexamethasone and passive antibody therapy as strategies for in vivo evaluation to demonstrate that the FA-S-induced model could be utilized in preclinical evaluation of drug candidates. This study may provide a practical mouse model that recapitulates the pathological features of SARS-CoV-2-induced ARDS in humans, which is easy to be established under standard laboratory conditions.

The control mice received the equal volume vehicle of PBS. Clinical symptoms and body-weight changes were monitored daily. Beginning at 1-day post instillation (dpi), mice demonstrated rapid weight loss, and reached the maximum weight loss on 2 dpi (wt mice) or on 3 dpi (hACE2 mice) (Fig. 1a) . The hACE2 mice have more susceptibilities with an approximately 20% loss of body weight on 3 dpi (Fig. 1a) .

At 6 h post instillation of inactivated SARS-CoV-2, we observed obvious accumulation of immune cells confining predominantly to perivascular sites, especially in hACE2 mice ( Supplementary Fig. S2b ). By 1 dpi, the immune cells infiltrated into parts of lung tissues with alveolar septal thickening ( Supplementary Fig. S2b ). By 3 dpi, both treated hACE2 and wt mice developed interstitial pneumonia characterized by inflammatory cell infiltration, interstitial edema, and . e, f Total protein (e) and fold change of LDH release (f) in BALF. wt and hACE2 mice treated with PBS were used as control. g Images of lung tissues with Evans blue dye retention on 3 dpi. Red asterisks indicated increased permeability appeared after instillation with inactivated SARS-CoV-2. hACE2 mice developed pulmonary edema and severe lung injury after intratracheal instillation of inactivated SARS-CoV-2. Data represent the mean \u00b1 SEM. Significance is indicated by: ns, no significance; *P \u2264 0.05, **P \u2264 0.01, ***P \u2264 0.001, ****P \u2264 0.0001 consolidation (Fig. 2a) . Pulmonary inflammation is a prominent manifestation of ARDS, and neutrophils in BALF correlate with the disease severity. 22, 23 We found a markedly elevated number of neutrophils around airway and perivascular sites, infiltrating to the pulmonary parenchyma and to the alveolar with increased MPO activities on 3 dpi, especially in treated hACE2 mice (Fig. 2a, c, d) . Neutrophils remained predominant cell infiltration throughout the lung tissues of both treated hACE2 and wt mice (Fig. 2a) . Obvious disruption of lung tissues and the disappearance of recognizable architecture could be easily observed in mice treated with inactivated SARS-CoV-2, and large number of dead cells were found in the background of inflammatory infiltrates (Fig. 2a) . Of note, treated hACE2 mice showed an earlier response and more severity pathological index with lung injury than those of wt mice ( Supplementary Fig. S2a-c) . In addition, hyaline membranes formation, necrotic debris, hemorrhage, proteinaceous debris, and apoptotic cells were also observed in treated hACE2 mice on 3 dpi (Fig. 2a-e) , consistent with diffuse alveolar damage. These results shared many features with those of a hACE2 mouse model intratracheally instilled with live SARS-CoV-2 ( Supplementary Fig.  S1b ). To better evaluate the pulmonary pathologies, we used a 5-grade scoring system as described previously. 20 The wt mice treated with inactivated SARS-CoV-2 reached an average score of 2-3 on 3 dpi, and treated hACE2 mice reached score of 3-4 ( Fig.  2b ). By 7 dpi, all treated animals showed alleviative pulmonary pathologies ( Supplementary Fig. S2b ). Together, these findings in treated hACE2 mice well recapitulate the pathologies observed in COVID-19 ARDS patients 24, 25 and other animal ARDS models, coincident with enhanced lung weight, increased permeability, hemorrhage, edema, and severe pathological changes. 8, 20, 21 Therefore, our mouse model may reflect the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2-induced ARDS in humans.",

Proinflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6, IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1, IL-2, IL-10, and G-CSF, showed robust increases both in sera and BALF on 3 dpi in treated mice ( Fig. 2f and Supplementary Fig. S3 ). Moreover, chemokines including MCP-1, RANTES, Eotaxin, KC, and MIP-1\u03b1/\u03b2 that recruit neutrophils, monocytes, macrophages or lymphocytes, were all elevated ( Fig. 2f and Supplementary Fig. S3 ). In line with our pulmonary pathological analysis, much higher levels of cytokines in hACE2 mice were observed than those in wt mice, suggesting the vital role of gene hACE2 in the immune response in SARS-CoV-2 infection. These data are coincided with the cytokine profiling in sera or BALF from the COVID-19 patients. 27, 28 Next, we performed flow cytometric analysis on lung homogenates and collected hemocytes on 3 dpi. Both treated hACE2 mice and wt mice showed significantly increased recruitments of Ly6G + neutrophils and CD11b + Ly6C hi inflammatory monocytemacrophages (IMMs) to lung tissues (Fig. 3a) ; however, only treated hACE2 mice showed elevated neutrophils in peripheral blood, indicating persistent chemotaxis ( Supplementary Fig. S4 ). In addition, we also observed an increase in activation markers of CD69 in IMMs and CD80 in neutrophils 29 (Fig. 3a) . The IMMs accumulation is highly correlated with the severe pulmonary injury reported in MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 infections. [29] [30] [31] Elimination of IMMs by intravenous (i.v.) injection of clophosome-A showed decreased lung weight and ameliorative pulmonary pathology, including lower interstitial edema, inflammatory cell infiltration, and pulmonary injury, with an average score of 1-2 in hACE2 mice by inactivated SARS-Cov-2 instillation ( Fig. 3b-e) ; however, elimination of pulmonary resident macrophages by pharyngeal aspiration (p.a.) administration of clophosome-A showed an exacerbated pulmonary pathology and an average score of 4 ( Fig. 3f-i) , suggesting the vital role of resident macrophages in the virus defense.",

We found that instillation of inactivated SARS-CoV-2 caused rapid weight loss in hACE2 mice and induced severe pulmonary disease on 3 dpi. The inactivated SARS-CoV-2 has no infected ability but can induce intense inflammatory responses after immediate instillation. The adaptive immune response in mice was characterized by rapidly high levels of proinflammatory cytokines/chemokines and the infiltration of activated neutrophils and IMMs in lung tissues, and T cell activation and effector and central T cells production resulting in pulmonary interstitial edema and consolidation. This caused detrimental changes in lung structure and function, including decreased oxyhemoglobin saturation and stiffening of the lung parenchyma, and progressed to ARDS.",

In the current study, we observed robust increases of proinflammatory cytokines/chemokines in sera and BALF, such as TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, KC, MCP-1, RANTES, and MIP-1\u03b1/\u03b2 27,28 which correlate with those observed in severe COVID-19 and ARDS patients. The improper activation of neutrophils contributes to the pathogenesis of COVID-19 and ARDS in severe cases because of the high levels of ROS, NET production, diffuse microvascular thrombosis, and cytokine storm. 23, 35, 36 In addition, the accumulation of IMMs, the pulmonary injury, and the impaired immune response were highly coincided with those in infections caused by influenza virus, 37 MERS-CoV, 29 SARS-CoV, 30 and SARS-CoV-2. 31 Notably, the ARDS induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection shares multiple similar immune signatures with that induced by influenza virus. 1 Here, we saw substantial myeloid cell infiltration throughout the lung tissues in treated hACE2 mice, including neutrophils, IMMs as well as activated T cells, with elevated MPO levels. The excess influx of neutrophils to alveolus pulmonis was also verified, which is highly related to ARDS development; 22, 36 however, this mouse model developed no obvious microvascular thrombosis. Pulmonary resident macrophages, i.e., alveolar macrophages, have an important role in maintaining pulmonary immune homeostasis and defending pathogen infections. 38 Elimination of resident macrophages induced more severe pulmonary pathology, 39 which was also confirmed in the current model. Of note, we observed a significant decrease of peripheric lymphocytes following instillation of inactivated SARS-CoV-2, consistent with lymphopenia observed in COVID-19 patients with ARDS. 32 The immunological process caused severe pulmonary pathology with diffuse alveolar damage in this mouse model, exhibiting hyaline membrane formation, the collapse of the alveolar space, hemorrhage, and interstitial edema, etc. This course well coincides with human pulmonary pathological changes observed in SARS-CoV-2-induced ARDS. 24, 25 Moreover, we also demonstrated a robust production of antibodies and the strong pseudovirus-neutralizing activity associated with a humoral response. The antibodies in hACE2 mice show great affinities to S1 protein of SARS-CoV-2, consistent with the observations in convalescent patients. 33 The current mouse model is also well suitable to evaluate the medical countermeasures, such as dexamethasone and passive antibody therapy in this study.",

We speculate that inactivated SARS-CoV-2 and components per se, especially spike glycoprotein, may be easier to combine with targeted cells via interacting with hACE2, which may help inactivated virus stay longer and trigger more intense inflammation. This may contribute the majority to the progress of the severe disease in hACE2 mice instilled with inactivated SARS-CoV-2. Further studies on the inactivated SARS-CoV-2-induced pulmonary pathogenesis in hACE2 mice are under investigation.",
