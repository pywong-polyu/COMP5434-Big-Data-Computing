R-Ver 3.4.2 was used for analysis and correlations. Results were considered significant at P < 0.05. Results A total of 303 patients satisfied inclusion criteria. Nineteen individuals (6.3%) had developed HO. Seven (37%) were diagnosed within 3 months of SCI. Twelve (63%) patients developed unilateral HO. The most common site for HO was hip joint (73%). A significant association was found between the presence of a pressure ulcer and development of HO (P = 0.01). Conclusions The incidence of HO was 6.3% in our institution and the hip joint is the most common site. Due to the presence of limited treatment options it is important to diagnose HO early in patients with SCI based on clinical features and later confirmed with laboratory tests and imaging.",

            "text": "Heterotopic ossification (HO) is the formation of lamellar bone within the soft tissue surrounding a joint. The incidence following a spinal cord injury (SCI) ranges between 1 and 50% which depends upon multiple factors like the study design and methods used for diagnosing HO [1] . HO is usually found in the first 6 months post SCI with a peak at 2 months after SCI [2] . About 20% of SCI patients develop clinically significant HO [2, 3] . Ankylosis of joint, pressure ulcers, nerve entrapment, deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pain are the associated complications [3] . The clinical presentation is quite varied from an incidental X-ray finding to severe limitation of joint range of motion (ROM) [2] . Both hereditary and acquired factors can contribute to the pathogenesis of HO [4] . During the acute phase, HO presents like an acute inflammatory condition with localised erythema, swelling, warmth, and restriction of joint motion. Risk factors for HO include older age (children and adolescents have a lower incidence), neurological complete lesions, male gender, spasticity, DVT and pressure sores [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] . HO is found to occur below the level of the SCI and the most common site being the hip (70-97%) [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] . There is no specific diagnostic criteria for HO, and it is extremely difficult to predict which spinal injury patient would subsequently develop HO [6] . HO is primarily diagnosed based on clinical signs, raised serum alkaline phosphatase (SAP) levels with positive imaging findings. The most sensitive technique for diagnosing HO is three-phase bone scan. CT and MRI can also aid in diagnosis but usually done if surgical interventions are planned [2] . During the acute inflammatory phase treatment consists of providing rest to the affected limb and indomethacin and bisphosphonates can be prescribed till acute inflammation has subsided with return of erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and SAP levels to normal [4] . Low-field irradiation and surgical resection are other options for management of HO [2] . In patients where HO interferes with functional abilities of an individual one can plan surgical excision of HO. Surgery when combined with radiation therapy helps in preventing postoperative recurrence [3] . Effect of prophylactic treatment with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or radiation therapy to prevent HO has not been studied in India. Treatment of HO in India most commonly consists of indomethacin, disodium etidronate and physical therapy and less commonly radiation therapy and surgery. Radiation and surgery are restricted to individuals with HO causing severe restriction in the functional abilities and activities of daily living. The response to treatment is limited once HO is completely formed. Despite widespread knowledge about HO in SCI there have not been any reports assessing the development of HO in India. The current study will help in elucidating incidence and characteristics of HO and potential risk factors in developing HO following SCI.",

The Institute Ethics Committee approval was sought before initiation of the study. Medical records of all consecutive patients diagnosed with SCI aged 15-60 years were reviewed for presence or absence of HO. Clinical signs to diagnose HO were fever, erythema, warmth, swelling and limitation in joint ROM. Blood investigations like erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and SAP levels were noted. We also reviewed Xrays, computerised axial tomography scans, ultrasonography and bone scans. X-ray findings suggestive of HO varied from an increased density of the peri-articular soft tissues to mature extra-osseous cortical and trabecular new bone formation. Patients with a premorbid history of HO, long bone fracture and head injury were excluded from the study. Age, gender, time since injury, level and degree of SCI and the presence of DVT, urinary tract infection (UTI) and pressure ulcers was recorded. Treatment charts of patients previously identified with HO were also reviewed. All study participants with HO were treated with indomethacin for 2-3 weeks. All study individuals with HO continued to receive ROM exercises. Vigorous exercises and forceful stretching were stopped till acute inflammation subsided. The demographic and clinical parameters were summarised by frequency and percentages and were compared based upon the presence or absence of HO. Chisquare test was used to determine statistical significance at P < 0.05. Data were analysed using the statistical software R-Ver 3.4.2 (R Core Team, 2018) [9] .",

This supports earlier studies which found a significant association between pressure ulcer and HO formation [2, 4, 6] . Inflammation is known to play a role in HO and pressure ulcers would represent an area of increased inflammation. Pressure sores may be seen as a late complication of HO, but since they occur more commonly before the clinical onset of HO, they could be considered a risk factor [2, 7] . However, there are studies to show that pressure ulcers do not influence HO development [7, 8] . Hence, it is difficult to draw a definitive conclusion about association between pressure ulcers and HO. We could not get accurate data regarding the grading and number of pressure ulcers to enable us to study the association between the severity of pressure ulcers and presence of HO.",

[10] found that HO most commonly occurs in the gluteal muscle group. They also concluded that since there is unavailability of specific tests for screening of HO, routine ultrasound screening particularly of the gluteal muscles can help in detecting early HO. Exercises focussing on hip extension and external rotation can be done after SCI to prevent HO. However, in a study done by Erhan et al.
