            "text": "Since the pandemic occurred due to the emergence of SARS-CoV-2, there has always been a demand for a simple and sensitive diagnostic kit for detection of SARS-Cov-2 infection. In January 2020, WHO approved the Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) for detecting the presence of Covid-19 genetic material in individuals. Till date many diagnostic kits have arrived in the market for quantification of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. In spite of being the gold standard method of Covid-19 detection, there are some drawbacks associated with RT-PCR which leads to false-negative results. Hence, in order to fulfil the need for an antibody testing kit for evaluating seroconversion and immunity acquisition in the population, an efficient, highly specific and sensitive assay, Chimera Soochak, an enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA) Kit has been developed. It works on the principle of detecting IgG antibodies developed specifically against the S1-RBD by employing a recombinant strain of S1-RBD produced in the HEK293 cell line. The developed kit was validated using different modes and methods to attain the utmost confidence on the samples collected from patients. The validation methodology included, validation with known samples, blind study, third-party validation, validation using WHO Reference Panel and comparison with FDA approved Surrogate virus neutralization kit. The kit was found successful in detecting IgG against the S1-RBD of SARS-CoV-2. The kit had been validated on multiple parameters. A total of 900 samples had been tested by using this kit and it has exhibited the sensitivity, specificity and accuracy for all the above-mentioned parameters.",

            "text": "The Covid pandemic has affected 171,038,461 individuals all over the world to date (https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/). The new mutation acquired by SARS-CoV-2 has increased the transmission rate of this virus (https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-0050 2-). It had been declared as a pandemic by WHO on 11th March 2020. The SARS-CoV-2 is a contagious virus that spreads rapidly through inhalation and ingestion of the viral droplets produced by infected persons (https://www.who.int/director-general/speeches/detail /who-director-general-s-opening-remarks-at-the-media-briefing-on-c ovid-19-11-march-2020). After entering into the host body, it causes mild symptoms like flu and cough; the severe outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infection leads to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in some patients (Boopathi et al., 2020) . The current diagnosis system for Covid-19 is varying from molecular testing to serological testing. All these assays are based on different target molecules and detection methodology (Sharma et al., 2020) . Serology based assay has several advantages over molecular testing as it can be useful for large scale testing and can be performed easily at a normal laboratory setup. These testing do not require the Biosafety Level-3 facility and highly sophisticated equipment to perform the test (Loeffelholz and Tang, 2020). The role of serology-based assay in determination of convalescent plasma titer and checking vaccine efficacy has been previously identified in several studies (Alandijany et al., 2020; Grau et al., 2021; Zilla et al., 2021) . Many commercial serology-based kits are available for testing the antibody against SARS-CoV-2; However, the sensitivity and specificity of these kits are uncertain (Ojeda et al., 2021; Kohmer et al., 2020) . Looking at these limitations, an attempt has been made to develop a simple, specific and sensitive ELISA Kit for the detection of the IgG against S1-RBD of SARS-CoV-2. The antibodies mainly IgG produced against the S1-RBD have shown the virus-neutralizing capacity (Gonz\u00e1lez-Stegmaier et al., 2021) . The role of S1 RBD has also been identified in the viral entry into the host cells and it is less conserved in the SARS-CoV family (Bastos et al., 2020) .",

Also, the kit has been validated against the virus neutralization assay and the result was found to be in correlation with the commercially available kit for virus neutralization (Du et al., 2009) . This kit has been validated with other commercially available kits (Link for other kits information). The development of a sensitive and specific assay based on the detection of neutralizing antibodies in human serum/plasma will help to evaluate the immune status of the country and also to ensure vaccine efficacy.
