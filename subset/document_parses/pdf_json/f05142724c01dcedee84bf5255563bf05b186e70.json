This research note examines the descriptive representation of women in the U.K. government's response to the coronavirus. It finds that 43% of the government's daily press briefings featured an all-male lineup with no female politician or expert present. In particular, female politicians are missing, with only one female cabinet member ever leading the briefing. Women's (in)visibility raises concerns about the legitimacy of democratic decisions and likely has policy consequences: women's absence may exacerbate gendered inequalities resulting from the crisis.",

There are normative grounds for ensuring gender balance in descriptive representation. Democratic theorists contend that the systematic exclusion of certain groups from decision-making means that legislative outcomes, processes, and institutions are not legitimate (Mansbridge 1999; Phillips 1998) . Such inequality in representation is a concern for the health of a democracy. Citizens may reflect these normative concerns; experimental evidence suggests that voters' perceived procedural legitimacy of a government decision increases when there is a gender balance among those deciding the outcome (Clayton, O'Brien, and Piscopo 2019) .",

Feminist scholars link descriptive representation to substantive representation (the actions of the representatives). \"There are particular needs, interests, and concerns that arise from women's experience, and these will be inadequately addressed in a politics that is dominated by men\" (Phillips 1998, 66) . There is mixed evidence for the link between women's presence and substantive representation of interests or issues (e.g., Homola 2019). We know that this link is imperfect as representation varies dependent on many factors, such as context, institutions, and the diversity of female representatives (Childs and Lovenduski 2013) . However, on balance, when women are present in decision-making bodies, the consequence is better outcomes for women. Women representatives identify their sex as a constituency (Childs 2004) and are more likely to act for women than men (Annesley et al. 2014; Catalano 2009; Celis 2013; Taylor-Robinson and Heath 2003; W\u00e4ngnerud 2009) .",

As Saward (2010) argues, representation can occur in multiple sites, beyond legislatures, and even outside of institutions and formal politics. These briefings are the public face of the government's decision-making on COVID-19 and therefore have clear symbolic consequences for female representation. Furthermore, although the briefings do not explicitly identify those who are responsible for policy, they likely reflect the priorities in the government's decision-making processes.",

Major health crises, such as the Ebola and Zika epidemics, have been shown to exacerbate gendered inequalities, in both cases \"leaving structural gender inequalities out of the crisis response has further compounded those [gender] inequalities\" (Davies and Bennett 2016, 1044) . In the case of COVID-19, there are a myriad of gendered inequalities that could be aggravated, which need to be recognized in policy responses. As people work from home with schools closed, the inequitable division of domestic labor and child care may negatively impact women. Initial evidence finds that U.K. mothers are more likely to have quit or lost their job since the beginning of the lockdown, and they are spending less time on paid work and more on household responsibilities than fathers (Andrew et al. 2020) . Survey evidence from the United States, United Kingdom, and Germany finds that in the United States and United Kingdom, women are significantly more likely to have lost their jobs due to COVID-19 (Adams-Prassi et al. 2020 ). Instances of domestic violence have seen significant increases in lockdown (Williamson, Lombard, and Brooks-Hay 2020) . Moreover, women make up 70% of health and social care workers on the front lines of the pandemic. 2 These gendered impacts have policy implications as the government negotiates lockdown and the subsequent economic impact of COVID-19.",

The prime minister and the health secretary were the most frequent leads alongside the foreign secretary (given the conventions of this position being deputized when the prime minister is ill), all of whom are male. Following these, a variety of cabinet members led briefings, all but one of them male. Women's underrepresentation here could be attributed to the diversity of Boris Johnson's cabinet: 6 of its 21 members are women. Yet only 17% (1 out of 6) women ministers led a briefing, compared with two-thirds (10 out of 15) of male cabinet ministers. Many of the women occupy cabinet positions that relate to COVID-19: for example, the secretary of state for work and pensions and the secretary of state for international trade (who is also minister for women and inequalities).",

Symbolically, women are not \"seeing\" themselves represented, and this has potential consequences for female political engagement.
