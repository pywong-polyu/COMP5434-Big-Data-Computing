With a sharp increase in the number of newly confirmed cases and the rapid progression of the disease into a critically ill state, overstretched critical care units have had to contend with a shortage of beds, specialist personnel, and medical resources. Temporary intensive care units (ICUs) were therefore set up in isolated hospitals to provide the required standardized care for all severe cases. The current paper describes the authors' experience of setting up and managing such an ICU in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, from the identification of critically ill COVID-19 patients through to the arranging and equipping of the unit, providing training and protection for staff, and standardizing all aspects of care.",

As COVID-19 is characterized by a high rate of contagion and rapid progression coupled with a high mortality rate, especially in the case of critical patients, it was essential to identify potentially critical cases at the earliest possible stage so they could be transferred to ICU timely to achieve necessary respiratory or circulation support in order to reduce mortality rates (4) .",

The government thus made the decision to allocate an estimated 2,500 beds in three general hospitals in the city of Wuhan as temporary isolated wards for the treatment of severely infected patients. Over 3,000 medical personnel, including up to 1,000 ICU doctors and nurses, were called together from elsewhere in China to form centralized, specialist rescue teams in each isolated hospital. Each member of the teams represented a different department; thus, uniform and normative team management and patient care were challenging. Existing medical resources were leveraged to meet the needs of these ICUs, and the training of non-ICU staff was also critically important.",

For this purpose, we modified the National Early Warning Score (News) (6) and SOFA score and added two further predicted risk factors for severe COVID-19 infection: age \u2265 66 years old (2, 7, 8) and persistent lymphocytopenia (2, 8, 9) (Figure 1) . Post-admission, critically ill patients were sorted into one of four risk categories on the basis of their scores on the severity grading scales: mild, moderate, critical, and severe critical. It was important to recognize that critically ill patients who presented with silent hypoxemia (severe hypoxemia without signs of respiratory distress), particularly older ones, required vigilant monitoring. Initially, due to the lack of severe respiratory distress symptoms at the early stage of COVID-19 in some severe confirmed patients, clinicians might delay tracheal intubation, and invasive ventilation. This postponing would bring disastrous consequences for these patients. Hence, early identification of severe critical patients was crucial in enabling personnel to offer optimized treatment within the temporary ICU in the shortest time.",

Minimizing the risk of nosocomial outbreak amplification and protecting healthcare workers are of critical importance (8, 12) . Widespread use of recommended barrier precautions in isolated wards must be of highly priority. The temporary ICUs set up to manage the epidemic in China established protocols for both the prevention of infection and contingency management, including PPE regulations, procedures for entering and leaving quarantined zones, emergency plans to cope with occupational exposure, checks on the hygiene standards observed by healthcare workers, and management of preventive medication. It is imperative that ensuring every healthcare worker is properly trained, continually protected against droplet infection, and versed in all the necessary checks and precautions, including the use of PPE. This is vital in the battle against a highly infectious disease such as COVID-19.",

It can be inferred that invasive mechanical ventilation was delayed, possibly due to a lack of the necessary equipment, specialist staff, or areas in which the procedure could be carried out or to a fear of infection during the operation of trachea intubation.",
