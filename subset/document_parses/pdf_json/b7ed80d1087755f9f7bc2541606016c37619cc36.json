            "text": "The complexities of viral evolution can be difficult to elucidate. Software simulating viral evolution provides powerful tools for exploring hypotheses of viral systems, especially in situations where thorough empirical data are difficult to obtain or parameters of interest are difficult to measure. Human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) infection has no durable cure; this is primarily due to the virus' ability to integrate into the genome of host cells, where it can remain in a transcriptionally latent state. An effective cure strategy must eliminate every copy of HIV-1 in this 'persistent reservoir' because proviruses can reactivate, even decades later, to resume an active infection. However, many features of the persistent reservoir remain unclear, including the temporal dynamics of HIV-1 integration frequency and the longevity of the resulting reservoir. Thus, sophisticated analyses are required to measure these features and determine their temporal dynamics. Here, we present software that is an extension of SANTA-SIM to include multiple compartments of viral populations. We used the resulting software to create a model of HIV-1 within host evolution that incorporates the persistent HIV-1 reservoir. This model is composed of two compartments, an active compartment and a latent compartment. With this model, we compared five different date estimation methods (Closest Sequence, Clade, Linear Regression, Least Squares, and Maximum Likelihood) to recover the integration dates of genomes in our model's HIV-1 reservoir. We found that the Least Squares method performed the best with the highest concordance (0.80) between real and estimated dates and the lowest absolute error (all pairwise t tests: P < 0.01). Our software is a useful tool for validating bioinformatics software and understanding the dynamics of the persistent HIV-1 reservoir.",

However, a durable HIV-1 cure cannot be achieved through cART alone since cART cannot (currently) target proviruses integrated into the host's genome in a transcriptionally latent state (Chun et al. 1997; Finzi 1997; Finzi et al. 1999) . HIV-1 proviruses from this HIV-1 persistent reservoir can reactivate years or decades after integration to produce replication-competent virions, meaning that cessation from cART can result in viral rebound and continuation of active infection after a few weeks (Davey et al. 1999) . For this reason, a durable HIV-1 cure must eliminate or permanently suppress every copy of HIV-1 integrated in the host's cells.",

            "text": "Crucial gaps in our knowledge of the HIV-1 reservoir persist, including the rate of introduction, genetic persistence and the specific timing of integration of the HIV-1 reservoir. For example, it is currently debated whether the reservoir is contributed to and maintained throughout the course of infection (Jones et al. 2018 (Jones et al. , 2020 Brooks et al. 2020) or if a high turnover during active infection results in a reservoir containing younger viruses (Brodin et al. 2016; Abrahams et al. 2019) . In order to address these knowledge gaps, we must develop and employ sophisticated phylodynamic tools, and these tools need to be assessed and validated to ensure their accuracy and efficacy. One means of validation is in silico simulation, but there are, to our knowledge, no tools currently available that are specifically designed to simulate HIV-1 genomes within host accommodating the HIV-1 reservoir. Current genome simulation software (Laval and Excoffier 2004; Mailund et al. 2005; Rodriguez-Carvajal 2008; Fletcher and Yang 2009; Petitjean and Vanet 2014; Haller and Messer 2017; Jariani et al. 2019) do not incorporate fitness, can only simulate one compartment/deme, or do not simulate viral replication, but instead assume bisexual reproduction with diploid genomes. The ability to simulate multiple compartments is necessary for HIV-1 within host simulation because of the presence the HIV-1 reservoir which acts as a separate compartment with different evolutionary characteristics than virus undergoing active replication.",

This is not adequate for modelling within host HIV-1 evolution where there is one population of viruses, which is constantly replicating, mutating, and evolving and another population, the HIV-1 persistent reservoir, which is in a latent state. To overcome this limitation, we modified SANTA-SIM to facilitate multiple compartments of viruses and genome transfer between compartments. We chose to modify SANTA-SIM over other software or creating new software due to its ease of extensibility, breadth of currently available model features, and mutability via the XML specification file. We added Java classes to represent compartments of viruses and epochs for compartments, and we added a Java interface for genome transfer with inheriting classes to model gene flow between compartments by a rate probability matrix, fitness or a timed event. Reduced class diagrams of SANTA-SIM and our modified SANTA-SIM are shown in Supplementary Figure S1 highlighting our changes. Users can specify compartments for their simulation model by adding a Compartment element to their XML file for each compartment they wish to include. Our modifications also maintain backwards compatibility with the original SANTA-SIM in that XML files without a Compartment element can be read and behave as if they had one compartment.",

Specifically, for each codon polymorphism investigated we set the fitness value at that site to the observed replication capacity, amino acids seen in NLK-43 and HX-B2 at those sites were given a fitness value of 1 (unless it was the same as the amino acid investigated) and all other amino acids at those sites were given an arbitrary fitness value of 0.001. We also enforced open reading frames in the genome by assigning zero fitness to stop codons in the gag, pol, vif, vpu, env, and nef and a relative fitness of 0.001 to non-start codons at the first positions of gag, vif, vpu, env, and nef. tat, rev, and vpr were not included for simplicity as tat and rev are split over multiple reading frame and position in the HIV-1 genome and vpr has an insertion in HX-B2. The active compartment follows a logistic population growth model with a growth rate of 50 replicates per generation (derived from Bui, Mellors, and Cillo 2016) and a carrying capacity of 10 5 viruses (a typical viral load in 1 mL of plasma).",

In addition to adjusting sampling frequency, sampling depth, reactivation rate, latency rate, latent growth rate, latent death rate, active growth rate, and mutation rate, we also removed and added fitness factors and incorporated recombination and indels. Furthermore, we created a simulation in which we sampled from the latent compartment during active infection. Finally, though we chose to begin our simulations with the ancestral HIV-1 genome HXB2, it is not required to start with that genome. We chose HXB2 because of its historical importance and its use as a standard for HIV-1 genome positioning. Thus, we also created a model starting with a full-length HIV-1 subtype C genome from Malawi (GenBank Accession KC156214) (Parrish et al., 2013) . This model did not have selection due to CD4 and HLA-I down-modulation in nef because the parameters for the fitness function are specific to subtype B, but the subtype C model contains coding regions adjusted for its genome. Parameters that we chose not to vary include the active population carrying capacity, the substitution rate biases, infection and simulation duration, and specific values for the fitness functions. However, all these parameters can be readily adjusted in the model specification XML file. Overall, the population size and genetic distance distributions were similar to the main 100 simulated data sets. Plots akin to the figures of the main article are shown in Supplementary Figures S3-S24 together with plots for a representative simulated data set (Supplementary Figure S2 ) from the main 100 simulated data sets; this representative data set had the smallest difference of mean and SD of sampled integration dates of genomes from the latent compartment from the median of the mean and median of the SD, respectively, of integration dates of genomes from the latent compartment among all 100 simulated data sets. In the simulation where the active growth rate was decreased, the active population did not immediately reach its carrying capacity as it did in all of the other simulations. The population size of the latent compartment exceeded the size of the active compartment in simulations where latency rate was increased, latent growth rate was increased or latent death rate was decreased. We recorded the number of lineages in each compartment over time where a lineage corresponds to a group of genomes who share a common ancestor and have no mutation between them or their ancestor. Overall, the proportion of lineages to the number of genomes was consistent across the simulated data sets. However, the simulation with a higher mutation rate had nearly the same number of lineages as genomes in the active compartment and the simulation with a lower mutation rate had few lineages in the active compartment.",

This method was one of three methods used by Abrahams et al. (2019) to infer the integration dates of reservoir sequences. Our second method is Clade (CD), which assigns the date of the reservoir sequence based on the dates of active sequences in the smallest subtree containing the reservoir sequence. The third method is Linear Regression (LR), which involves training a linear regression with the active sequences and then estimating the integration dates of the reservoir sequences using the regression. This method was used by Jones et al. (2018) and Brooks et al. (2020) to infer the timing of integration of proviral sequences. The penultimate method is Least Squares (LS), which aims to mimimize the variance between the dates and the branch lengths of the tree. This method employs the software: LSD ); originally designed for estimating divergence dates, the latest version of LSD includes estimating sequence ages. The final method is ML, which selects dates to maximize a likelihood function. For this study we used a modified version of node.dating (Jones and Poon 2016), which like LSD can also estimate sequence ages in the latest version.

The distributions of real and estimated integration dates are shown in Fig. 5A and error metrics are shown in Fig. 5B and Table 1 . On these data, the Least Squares (LS) method was the most accurate with the lowest root mean square error, highest concordance (Table 1 ) and lower absolute errors (Friedman and all pairwise t tests: P < 0.01). The only method whose error had significant skewness was the CS method, which had a negative skewness (\u00c01.31). Together with this method's highly negative median error of \u00c00.596 years indicates a tendency for this method to estimate older dates. The methods overall had negative skewness but were all greater than \u00c01. The negative skewness of the methods may be a result of the distribution of the actual integration dates being skewed to younger dates and not an actual preference for estimating older dates.",

            "text": "There are many reasons why the LS method may outperform the other methods. Since the LS method treats time as a continuous variable, it is not restricted to the sampled time points for the estimated dates like in the CS and CD methods. The LR method assumes that the data follow a strict molecular clock, which is not held over longer periods of time during within-host HIV-1 infection (Shankarappa et al. 1999) , and the LR method is naive to the topology of the phylogeny. The LS and ML methods instead allow variable evolutionary rates over the edges of the phylogeny. Finally, the LS method estimates the overall evolutionary rate while running whereas the ML method uses a fixed overall evolutionary rate that is precomputed by linear regression. The flexibility of the LS method coupled with its statistical framework is probably why it achieves lower error over the other methods. Finally, we investigated how varying the model parameters would affect the date estimation performance. The actual integration dates of the simulations all skew towards the start of therapy ( Fig. 5A and Supplementary Figures S3F-S24F) , consistent with previous studies (Brodin et al. 2016; Abrahams et al. 2019) . In Supplementary Table S1, we recorded the method with the highest concordance for each data set. Though every method was represented, the LS method performed the best in more data sets. Notably, changing the sampling frequency or depth did not change the preferred method from LS. Also, the CS and CD methods, which heavily rely on sampled time points, perform poorly when the sample frequency and depth are decreased. Comparing the error distributions of the methods across data sets (Supplementary Figures S3G-S24G ) reveals that the LS method in general has a tight symmetrical error distribution. Notably, when we added indels (Supplementary Figure S22 ) or even recombination (Supplementary Figure S23) , the LS method still performed well with concordances between estimated and real dates of 0.794 and 0.983, respectively, though the CS method performed best for the simulation with recombination with a concordance between estimated and real dates of 0.989. For the simulation with recombination, we retained all of the sequences regardless of whether they were recombinants or not. This is not advised in general, since recombination violates the hypothesis of phylogenetics that each lineage has only one parent.",

First, we clipped the simulated data shown in Fig. 3 and Supplementary Figure S2 from nucleotide positions 9,163 to 9,225 (nef codons: 123-143) to generate an alignment 63 nucleotide bases long for one data set. For comparison, nef is 618 bases long. We chose this region because it contained the most (four) amino positions under selection, according to our fitness model, than any other 63 nucleotide base long alignment. We used the full genome of the same data for a second data set. We removed duplicate sequences and inferred phylogenies from these alignments as previously described and performed the five date estimation methods. The results are shown in Supplementary Figures S26 and S27 . The LR method had the highest concordance between estimated and actual dates (0.571) for the 63 base long alignment and the ML method had the highest concordance between estimated and actual dates (0.844) for the full genome alignment. The LS method did not perform much worse than the ML method in the full genome alignment with a concordance between estimated and actual dates of 0.834; however, the LS method performed poorly CS: we find the closest sequence (light blue path) to our query sequence and assign the date of the closest sequence (light blue number) to the query sequence (red number). (C) CD: we find the smallest subtree containing the query sequence and at least one active sequence (light blue subtree). We then take the mode of the dates of the active sequences in the subtree (light blue numbers) and assign it as the query sequence date (red number). (D) LR: we find the linear regression of the collection dates versus the divergence of the active sequences (solid light blue line). Using the divergence of the query, we compute the date (dotted red line) using the linear regression. (E) LS: we assign dates to the internal nodes (light blue numbers) and the query sequences (red number) so as to minimize the divergence between the evolutionary rate of the branches and the difference in the times at the start and end of the branches. (F) ML: we assign dates to the internal nodes (light blue numbers) and the query sequences (red number) to maximize the likelihood of the time scaled tree. on the 63 base long alignment with a concordance between estimated and actual dates of 0.413. For context, the concordance between estimated and actual dates of the LS method on the original data set with a full nef alignment shown in Supplementary Figure S2 was 0.783. Overall, the methods perform better on longer alignments. The error distributions of all methods were worse for the 63 base long alignment (see Supplementary Figure S26F ) with lots of under and over estimation. In the LS method, there was a sequence that dated to 6.47 years after therapy initiation (see the fifth distribution from the top in Supplementary Figure S26E) . Note, it is not possible for genomes to enter the reservoir during therapy in our simulations. Estimating dates later than sampling time is a possibility for the LS method and also the LR and ML methods. This phenomenon has been observed in empirical data using linear regression (Jones et al. 2018) ; however, the 95% confidence intervals of the estimates contained the sampling dates. The CS and CD methods do not have this drawback because they can only give estimated dates that are from sampled time points of active sequences, which is itself a drawback.",

The date estimation methods for the empirical data were performed in the same manner as for the simulated data with the plasmaderived RNA sequences treated as coming from the active compartment and the PBMC-derived DNA sequences treated as coming from the latent compartment. Although we cannot be certain about the actual integration dates in the empirical data, we can compare the estimates from each method (Supplementary Table S2 and Supplementary Figure S28 ). In terms of root mean squared deviation (RMSD) and concordance between estimates, the LS and ML were most similar. This is consistent with our findings in simulated data, where these methods outperformed the other methods. The most extreme difference between methods was between the CD and LS methods, which had an RMSD of 2.60 years and a concordance of 0.570. Overall, this is not a significant difference in the estimates; the Pearson correlation coefficient between the estimates for the CD and LS methods was 0.573 with a P-value <0.01.

Most notably, it does not incorporate recombination nor insertions and deletions in the genome, all of which are common in HIV-1 (Clavel et al. 1989; Vartanian et al. 1991; Wood et al. 2009 ). The decay of the HIV-1 persistent reservoir is not strictly exponential as our model assumes, but instead its half-life lengthens over time (Strain et al. 2005) . We also recognize that CD4 and HLA-I down-modulation in nef are far from the only evolutionary pressures faced by HIV-1. For example: cytokine, chemokine, SERINC3 and SERINC5 regulation (Grant and Larijani 2017; Usami, Wu, and G\u00f6 ttlinger 2015) and co-receptor tropism (Berger, Murphy, and Farber 1999; Delobel et al. 2005 ) all affect HIV-1 fitness within host. Our simulation assumes that cART offers a completely inhospitable environment for active HIV-1 with a fitness function of zero; however, HIV-1 drug resistance resulting from point mutations can and does occur resulting in detectable viral loads and viral evolution (Shafer 1998; Ledergerber et al. 1999; Wang et al. 2011) . PBMCs in the blood with transcriptionally latent HIV-1 provirus do not constitute the entirety of HIV-1 in an individual on cART. HIV-1 can also persist in anatomical reservoirs including but not limited to: lymphoid tissue (Finzi et al. 1999) , cerebrospinal fluid (Rose et al. 2016; Oliveira et al. 2017 ) and male and female reproductive organs (Bull et al. 2009; Miller et al. 2019) ; that may contribute to viral rebound after cessation of cART (Rothenberger et al. 2015; De Scheerder et al. 2019) . These features are all planned for later iterations of our model.",

Next, we identified the best fitting model using ModelTest-NG v0.1.6 (Darriba et al. 2020 ) and inferred a ML tree using RAxML v8.2.11 (Stamatakis 2014) . Finally, we rooted the trees with root-to-tip regression maximizing the correlation between the sampling dates of the sequences from the active compartment and their divergence from the root with the R package ape (Paradis and Schliep, 2019) . Finally, we applied each of the methods detailed in the following sections to the tree. Subsequent statistical analyses and visualization were performed using the R packages: tidyverse (Wickham et al. 2019) , ggtree (Yu et al. 2016) , and treeio (Wang et al. 2020 ).",
