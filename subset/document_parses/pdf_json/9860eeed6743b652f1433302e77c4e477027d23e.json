The federally funded, state-operated nutrition program was authorized initially in 1972 as a two-year pilot program as part of the amended Child Nutrition Act of 1966 (P.L. 92-443) [5] . In 1975, WIC was made permanent (P.L. 94-105) and is part of the forthcoming Child Nutrition Reauthorization [5, 6] .",

The WIC program provides supplemental food and beverages (called a nutrition prescription or the WIC food package) and as well as nutrition education, breastfeeding support, and referrals for healthcare and social services through grants provided from the USDA Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) to administrative agencies [4] . The WIC program is widely considered to be one of the most successful nutrition intervention policies [4, 9] . Research has shown that participation in WIC is associated with improvements in infant and child health outcomes [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] , nutrition intake and diet-related outcomes [15, 16] , and access to health care [17, 18] . In 2019, the average number of women, infants, and children receiving WIC benefits each month was approximately 6.4 million, with an average monthly food package per person of $40.90 [19] .",

New guidelines required increased availability of healthy foods and beverages such as whole grain breads, low-fat milks, and brown rice along with the introduction of a Cash Value Benefit to enable the purchase of fruits and vegetables (FVs). In compliance with this change, WIC vendors were required to maintain minimum stock of such products, although guidelines differ by state [27] . Research published in the last 10 years reflects considerable interest in understanding the feasibility and impacts of the 2009 WIC program changes on WIC participant diet, obesity, and food and beverage availability, as well as on breastfeeding practices [15, [28] [29] [30] [31] . Administrative vendor selection and authorization criteria and vendor management and operations policies, however, are not well understood [27, 32] , and to date there is no research which describes and compares criteria and policies across administrative agencies, nor any single database which houses such information, although state vendor manuals and other related program materials can be shared on the National WIC Association's WIC Hub (thewichub.org, accessed on 26 March 2021).",

Improving access to WIC foods may increase WIC participation retention as difficulty finding and shopping for WIC foods is a leading cause of early exit from the WIC program [33] . Specifically, our research sought to examine WIC vendor selection and authorization criteria across all 89 administrative agencies (i.e., 50 US states, 33 ITOs, the District of Columbia, five US Territories) in order to describe the nature and frequency of variations in policies across these geographic units.",

This Collaborative is a joint effort of the Healthy Eating Research (HER), a national program of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, and the Nutrition and Obesity Policy and Research Network (NOPREN)-a multi-disciplinary research network based out of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In addition to HER NOPREN WIC Learning Collaborative representation, the subgroup included liaisons from the National WIC Association. The subgroup identified data categories through internal dialogue and through discussion based on these criteria: (1) likely variation across states, (2) potential for influence on the local food retail landscape, and/or (3) influence on in-store product promotion or display. The data categories that were ultimately established included those that function to support both vendor selection and authorization as well as vendor management and operations. Next, definitions were established to ensure consistency in documentation. Table 1 ",

Team members walked through discrepancies to clarify definitions and to identify where to find needed data within administrative agency documents. During these weekly meetings, definitions were revised as needed to improve clarity and better capture content. Variables of interest were initially entered in a database as direct quotes from the source documents and were later summarized using categorical descriptors designed by the research team for each variable. For example, the categorical descriptors for \"minimum number of cash registers\" were: (1) At least one, (2) Three, (3) Dependent on WIC volume sales requirement, and (4) Not listed.

Results were compared to identify inconsistencies in definitional understanding. The process revealed consistent understanding of definitions with only a few improvements needed; however, it yielded new learnings for the inconsistencies in agency documentation wherein its source documents were not always aligned. As a result, the team refined the process to require that researchers first review the vendor manual for information, relying on its contents as the preferred source of information, since it was often the most complete document with regard to containing needed data. After a second round of review, it was demonstrated that the revised document utilization process, coupled with improved definitions, resulted in consistency across researcher data entries. Descriptive statistics were calculated for all variables. In order to display information visually to assess geographic and regional patterns including clustering of variables of interest, Geographic Information System (GIS) (ArcGIS Pro 2.3, Environmental Systems Research Institute (ESRI), Redlands, CA, USA) was used to visualize the spatial distribution of coded variables at the state level.

Historically WIC vouchers were utilized via paper coupons requiring clients to use their entire monthly benefit at the same time in the same store; however, in nearly all states this is no longer the case [34] . New WIC EBT processes enable clients to utilize benefits to purchase eligible products across the month, so WIC clients no longer risk sacrificing benefits should a store not have a certain item in stock [35] . The contextual shift to EBT therefore calls to question the rationale for some of the foundation guidance states have relied on, and gives rise to new opportunities to revisit WIC vendor selection and authorization criteria. Such a shift in operational process, opens new doors to coordination between WIC and SNAP including the potential to resolve capacity issues at state WIC agencies to monitor vendor compliance.

Future multi-disciplinary work could examine the most critical administrative agency variations needed to allow for contextual and cultural adaptations and to stimulate innovations, while also ensuring the free flow of commerce between states is not obstructed (US Constitution, Article 1, Section 8, Clause 3).

The characteristics of stores used by administrative agencies to determine eligibility, such as minimum square footage, number of registers (beyond federal requirements), or full-service status vary without any consistent pattern. If a large percentage of WIC participants live in lower income neighborhoods, they may have more barriers to accessing WIC vendors in the states with increased or more stringent requirements. Furthermore, the accessibility of retailers which offer a variety of healthy products in communities may have implications for other food access efforts, such as additional monies for fruit and vegetable benefits, voucher and/or incentive programs. A study by Zenk et al. (2014) measured the impact of the fruit and vegetable voucher added to the WIC-approved food packages on fruit and vegetable prices found that WIC participants' purchasing power differed depending on the type and neighborhood of the WIC vendor used [38] . Indeed, for many WIC products, variation in cost is less important to the consumer, because it is redeemed by item and not by cost. However, this issue can be significant for fruit and vegetables which WIC participants purchase by a set dollar amount rather than by number of items.",

Results from this examination suggest that smaller WIC vendors and distributors may be disproportionally impacted by WIC vendor eligibility criteria. Vendor monitoring requirements represent a sizable burden to states, which often have to fulfill requirements with very limited state agency staff. As a consequence, states may limit vendor eligibility to narrow requirements to fewer stores. One other area of consideration, which was not undertaken in this study, is the role that state specific infant formula and jarred baby food specifications may have on limiting vendor participation.",

            "text": "Limiting the landscape of WIC vendors may have substantial impacts on communities. Research has shown that increasing the number of WIC authorized vendors results in increased availability of healthy foods and beverages, benefiting both WIC-participants and non-WIC participants [43] . Research has also demonstrated that authorizing smaller stores as WIC redemption sites can improve the healthfulness of products not just in these small stores, but also in neighboring non-WIC authorized competitor stores as well [44] . Authorization to accept WIC benefits has advantages for retailers. Research has found that becoming a vendor led to an increases in both sales of healthy, WIC-eligible foods and in average weekly dollar sales, in comparison to similar stores that were not authorized as a WIC vendor [45] . Discount variety retailers provide an opportunity to provide healthy foods and beverages to low-income rural areas and urban food deserts [45, 46] . These small-format stores sell an array of food, household, and other miscellaneous products at reduced prices. However, these retailers often operate a regional distribution model, and meeting WIC vendor criteria that varies from region to region or state to state can be challenging. More research remains to better understand the value of state WIC vendor authorization authority, particularly in states that have provided stronger monitoring requirements. This work might also examine if and how streamlining WIC vendor criteria (or at least certain components of them) across regional areas or across the country could provide an opportunity to advance interstate commerce and promote an equitable supply of food across the food system, while ensuring the protection for local, community-oriented WIC vendors.",

Strategies aligned with the \"4 P's\" of marketing (product, price, promotion, placement) have demonstrated effectiveness at increasing product sales, both alone and in combination. The present study found that 75% of states allow stores to include WIC shelf tags on all eligible items, and slightly fewer (69%) have established parameters to do so. Results raise questions about the rationale for limiting labeling in the 25% of states that do so, and also open doors for new opportunities to understand, and potentially update, established labeling criteria, given the evolution of research on healthy in-store marketing practices [22, [48] [49] [50] . For example, working with retailers, including thought leaders such as large, big box retailers, to establish a national WIC-approved labeling program, along with revised state guidance, could result in more efficient benefit access and use for both customers who now redeem benefits via EBT across multiple shopping trips and the retailers that sell WIC-approved products. More work remains to explore how improvements in nationwide uniformity of WIC labeling policies might better align with the general trend for federal preemption in promulgating nutrition labeling as put forth by the Nutrition Labeling and Education Act (NLEA) (P.L. 101-535).",

One of WIC's goals is to reduce disproportionate health outcomes across social and economic groups by providing access to WIC-approved foods to participating populations. With the forthcoming Child Nutrition Reauthorization, findings suggest an opportunity for Congress to hold inquiries on opportunities to further improve the WIC program. First, there is a need for a common database to house all administrative agencies' WIC plan information, including vendor selection and authorization criteria, so that variations in requirements across states, ITOs, and territories are able to be analyzed and considered alongside other user data. Given the variations across administrative agencies in these criteria, and the lack of apparent pattern guiding a rationale for the variations, there is an opportunity to convene WIC stakeholders to review variations, their rationale, and implications thereof, since this process could result in improved policies to ensure and improve healthy food access by WIC participants. Our results suggest too that there is an opportunity to revisit the potential for WIC product labeling among the 25% of states that do not expand labeling to all WIC products. Finally, findings provide an opportunity in the 75% of states that allow labeling of all WIC products to examine, as a next step, their characteristics such as their content, color, imaging, dimensions, and frequency of re-positioning to ensure that they align with healthy in-store marketing best practices.
