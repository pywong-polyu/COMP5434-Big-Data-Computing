The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality, which was analyzed according to the month of admission and age group and in a subgroup of patients requiring intensive care unit (ICU) admission. Secondary outcomes included length of hospital stay, length of ICU stay, and median cost of ICU stay vs non-ICU stay. Survival probabilities by length of stay were plotted according to month of admission and patient age group. The Cochran-Armitage test was used to assess the linear trend in mortality proportions over time. Statistical significance was set at \u03b1 = .05 for 2-sided P values. Analyses were performed using Stata, version 16 (StataCorp LLC).",

In-hospital mortality increased in association with increasing age; 179 of 12 644 patients (1.4%) aged 18 to 29 years died, and 8277 of 31 135 patients (26.6%) 80 years or older died.
