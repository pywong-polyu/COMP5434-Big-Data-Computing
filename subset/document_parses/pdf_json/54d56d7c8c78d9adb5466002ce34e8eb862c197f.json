Many arthropods, some bene\u00decial and some detrimental, inhabit poultry houses. The lesser mealworm, Alphitobius diaperinus (Panzer) (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae), is a pest commonly found in poultry litter that can harbor pathogens involved in both human and animal health issues. Current farm management practices perpetuate persistent infestations contributing to the dispersal of beetles and pathogens. To study the dissemination of bacteria by this beetle, we require the ability to differentiate internal from external sources of bacteria carried by the beetle. In this study, we tested previously described methods to externally disinfect beetles and found disinfectant ef\u00decacies between 40 and 98%. The irregular surface of the insect posed a challenge to cleansing procedures because the surface offered many recesses able to sequester bacteria.

Commercial solutions, however, usually contain minute amounts of impurities, which can cause decomposition; therefore, stabilizers are sometimes added (Goor 1989 , Hess 1995 , CHEMINFO 2005 . Concentrated H 2 O 2 solutions can also react exothermically with solvents. Although H 2 O 2 proved to be the best cleansing agent, its instability in pure form and exothermic reactivity at high concentrations made it problematic to use; therefore, we investigated a commercially available substitute. The substitute consisted of a less concentrated formulation of 7.35% H 2 O 2 with the addition of 0.23% peracetic acid, a stabilizer, a surfactant and a corrosion inhibitor. Our results demonstrate that this formulation was as effective as 20% H 2 O 2 treatment.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 483, "end": 493, "text": "(Goor 1989", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 494, "end": 505, "text": ", Hess 1995", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 506, "end": 521, "text": ", CHEMINFO 2005", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "The thin epicuticle secreted on the outside of the cuticle serves to minimize loss of insect body water, contributing to their success in a terrestrial environment (Bursell and Clements 1967) .

When investigating bacterial transfer, complete exoskeleton disinfection is important to discern conclusively an internal source of contamination. Several previously reported studies used protocols that purportedly disinfected the surface of beetles; however, we could \u00dend no data validating the ef\u00decacy of the described techniques. Although it is possible that the insects harbor bacterial organisms internally, in-suf\u00deciently sterilized exoskeletons can contaminate subsequent homogenized specimens. Therefore, it would be unclear whether the bacteria being measured were actually being harbored internally. We found that a combination of treatment with 95% EtOH, allowed to evaporate, followed by a 20% H 2 O 2 or 7.35% H 2 O 2 /0.23% peracetic acid wash removed all culturable, aerobic bacteria from the external surface of the adult lesser mealworms.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}], "bib_entries": {"BIBREF0": {"ref_id": "b0", "title": "Categorical data analysis", "authors": [{"first": "A", "middle": [], "last": "Agresti", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2002, "venue": "", "volume": "", "issn": "", "pages": "", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF1": {"ref_id": "b1", "title": "Handbook of microbiological media", "authors": [{"first": "R", "middle": ["M"], "last": "Atlas", "suffix": ""}], "year": 1997, "venue": "", "volume": "", "issn": "", "pages": "", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF2": {"ref_id": "b2", "title": "Population changes of four species of insects in three deep pit poultry houses", "authors": [{"first": "D", "middle": ["M"], "last": "Armitage", "suffix": ""}], "year": 1986, "venue": "Entomol.
