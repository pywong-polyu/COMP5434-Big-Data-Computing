In total, all patients were found positive for bacterial infections, including seventeen Acinetobacter baumannii (90%) and two Staphylococcus aureus (10%) strains. There was no difference in the bacteria species detected in any of the sampling points. Seventeen of 17 strains of Acinetobacter baumannii were resistant to the evaluated antibiotics. No metallo-beta-lactamases -producing Acinetobacter baumannii strain was found. One of the Staphylococcus aureus isolates was detected as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and isolated from the patient who died, while another Staphylococcus aureus strain was susceptible to tested drugs and identified as methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus.",

The damage of ciliated cells can also be observed in association with respiratory syncytial virus infection; it can result in deterioration of mucociliary clearance, increased adhesion of bacteria to mucins and, enhanced colonization of the bacteria in the airway. Moreover, new receptors for bacterial adherence can emerge following the virus-induced death of the airway epithelial cells [9] . In addition, after an acute inflammatory reaction and pulmonary tissue damage induced by viral infections, a resolving/repair phase of the lung tissue takes place. Due to varied immune responses in different individuals, this phase may cause an enhanced susceptibility to respiratory bacterial infections. Thus, bacterial superinfection can occur after a viral infection, which in turn might lead to increased morbidity and mortality [10] .",

According to our infection control committee and laboratory reports, these were associated with other bacteria including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter spp., Serratia marcescens, and Citrobacter freundii, etc. that were previously isolated from the ICU wards and non COVID-19 patients admitted to our ICUs. In addition, both A. baumannii and S. aureus were among the most isolated bacteria from non COVID-19 ICU patients in Iran and other countries [25] . In a 2019 study conducted in Tehran, Iran, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Acinetobacter had the highest rates of incidence in ICUs [26] . In a 2018 study, A. baumannii and Klebsiella spp. were the most common organism isolated in Mysuru, India [27] .

In a study conducted in Shiraz, Iran, in 2009, Hassanzadeh et al. suggested that ICU-acquired infections were documented in 51.7% of ICU patients, with a mortality rate of 10.9% (5 patients) [29] . One of the reasons for the increase in infection rate in our study can be due to the simultaneous infection of the virus and bacterium. As previously mentioned, viruses can facilitate the attachment and colonization of the bacteria in the respiratory tract, which is certainly no exception for COVID-19; however, understanding the accurate mechanisms of interactions between novel coronavirus and other bacteria requires further research. Nevertheless, other factors such as ICU type, used equipment rate, admission/ discharge criteria, high workload/nurse ratio, etc. can also affect the quality of care and the rate of ICU acquired nosocomial infection [30, 31] , especially in pandemics. Except for colistin, A. baumannii strains showed widespread resistance to all different classes of antibiotics and no inhibition zone was observed in the disk diffusion method. Resistant isolates of the bacteria, especially A. baumannii, are not uncommon among admitted patients in the hospitals and hospital-acquired infections have become a major concern to health systems. Wang et al. showed that the resistance rate of A. baumannii isolates was approximately > 98% to piperacillin, imipenem, ceftriaxone, ciprofloxacin, and ceftazidime [32] . Castilho et al. also reported that A. baumannii isolates from ICUs in Goi\u00e2nia, Brazil, were classified as multidrug resistant (MDR) with a high incidence of resistance to carbapenems. The development of resistance to carbapenems and other \u03b2-lactams may be due to the production of the MBLs. These are one of the most common participating in resistance mechanisms that can inactivate a wide range of \u03b2-lactam antibiotics [33] . Nevertheless, no MBL-producing A. baumannii strain was isolated. However, the bacteria may use other strategies to resist the effects of antibiotics [34, 35] .",

A multicenter retrospective cohort study conducted by Arabi et al. on 330 MERS SARI (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Severe Acute Respiratory Infection) patients who were admitted to the participating ICUs showed that 18% (60 cases) and 5% (17 cases) of them had bacterial and viral co-infections, respectively [43] . It has also been estimated that one-third of the world's population (~500 million people) may have been clinically infected during the 1918-19 influenza pandemic, which resulted in the death of at least 50 million people worldwide (https://www.cdc.gov/flu/pandemic-resources/1918-pandemic-h1n1.html). The findings suggest that the vast majority of individuals who died during the pandemic were infected by a bacterial infection [44] .",

In a study performed by Bhat et al. during the 2003-2004 influenza season, bacterial co-infections were identified in 24 of 102 cases. Accordingly, S. aureus was the most common etiology (11 cases); six of these 11 cases were detected as methicillin-resistant strains [45] . Randolph et al. also reported that among 838 children with influenza A (H1N1) virus admitted to a pediatric intensive care unit during the 2009 influenza A (H1N1) pandemic, 71 (8.5%) had a presumed diagnosis of early S. aureus co-infection of the lung with 48% positive for MRSA [46] . Moreover, Jia et al. project on mouse model findings also showed that secondary infection with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus after infection with influenza virus was associated with high mortality rates [47] . Another study by Liu et al. also confirmed that the co-infection of avian influenza A (H7N9) virus and extensively antibiotic-resistant A. baumannii in the patients with invasive mechanical ventilation is a key factor for the severity of the disease and high mortality [48] .",

Our findings emphasize the concern of bacterial infections in the patients due to A. baumannii and S. aureus that are resistant to the extended-spectrum antibiotics commonly used for the treatment of life-threatening bacterial diseases, especially in ICU patients. Secondary bacterial infections may develop during or following COVID-19 and thus they are an undeniable fact. Due to severe pandemic conditions, it was not possible to have a negative control group without COVID-19 in our ICUs simultaneously. Therefore, we could not certainly state what percentages of deaths in our patients were caused by bacterial coinfections. However, when mortality rates compared to other non COVID-19 studies, e.g. 10.9% in Shiraz [29] and 17.8% in Mysuru [27] , it seems that mortality is increased in COVID-19 patients and may be attributed to bacterial co-infections. Thus, further studies are recommended to confirm this finding. Mortality in COVID-19 positive patients with no underlying diseases may be due to bacterial infections that this concern also requires more investigations. Overall, it is important to limit the risk of infection and the spread of these resistant strains through controlling nosocomial infections accurately and bringing secondary infections caused by resistant bacteria that can increase the mortality rate in COVID-19 critical patients into attention.
