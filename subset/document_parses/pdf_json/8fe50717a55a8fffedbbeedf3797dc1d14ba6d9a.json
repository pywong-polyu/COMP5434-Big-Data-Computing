This advantage is realized from similar processes for production for each new molecule [14] . MAbs are often amenable to efficient production using mammalian host cells, owing to high titers of secreted protein and standardized purification processes allowing for streamlined recovery. Without these features, non-mAbs require bespoke processes to produce and present distinct technical challenges. For example, many subunit vaccines are produced in intracellular compartments, like inclusion bodies in bacterial cells, which must be recovered by cellular lysis, multiple stages of chromatography, and often solubilization or refolding to achieve the desired conformation for immunogenicity. Reducing the number of steps in production, along with increasing the volumetric productivity for a given antigen, could maximize efficiency-and thus lower costs, of manufacturing [15, 16] .",

We engineered a trivalent subunit vaccine candidate for rotavirus to enable an improved process for production that uses 50% fewer steps (relative to a reference process based on intracellular bacterial expression and recovery) [17] . We minimally modified the sequences of the three candidate protein antigens to promote secretion by a yeast host using a combination of genomic sequencing methods to inform specific changes for each antigen. These targeted changes improved the secreted titer and quality for each serotype antigen, addressing molecular variants affecting the quality attributes of these proteins, including aggregation, unwanted glycosylation, and N-terminal truncation. We showed all three antigens were compatible with concomitant expression and co-purification in a single campaign. This study provides a proof-of-concept for integrated manufacturing of a multi-valent subunit vaccine while retaining quality and relative quantities of the antigens.",

While live viral vaccines are available for rotavirus, low-cost subunit vaccines could facilitate improved global coverage [17, 20, 21] . A trivalent non-replicating rotavirus vaccine (NRRV) designed at the NIH is currently advancing in clinical development. This candidate vaccine comprises three recombinant fusion-protein antigens based on VP8 truncations of the serotypes P [4] , P [6] , and P [8] [22] . Each VP8 truncation is genetically fused at the N-terminus to the P2 epitope of tetanus toxin (Fig. 1a) . The current manufacturing strategy for these three serotypes involves fermentation in Escherichia coli, and recovery by multiple steps of centrifugation, cell lysis, and chromatography, followed by blending of the three antigens and formulation with adjuvant [23] . While the three serotypes have largely homologous amino acid sequences (Fig. 1b) , they are different enough to present unique manufacturing challenges, making this subunit vaccine candidate an ideal case study for molecular engineering to improve its production.",

Secretion-based strategies for production are also conducive for continuous operations that can increase the volumetric productivity in manufacturing [24] . For these reasons, we sought to enable secretion of the three antigens in the yeast Komagataella phaffii. We tested the secreted expression of each NRRV serotype independently in K. phaffii using the reported amino acid sequences expressed in Escherichia coli [23] . To adapt the sequences of each of the three antigens for this purpose, we optimized the codons of the genes for each serotype for expression in K. phaffii, added a signal peptide for secretion into the culture supernatant, and then assessed protein titers and quality following small-scale batch cultivation (Fig. 1c) . Each serotype presented a markedly different set of molecular variants when recovered. The P [4] antigen was observed with a titer of ~ 50 mg/L in plate-scale culture (Additional file 1: Fig. S1A ), but exhibited a high fraction of low-molecular weight variants. The P [6] antigen was barely detected in culture supernatant or intracellularly (Additional file 1:",

In our approach, we adopted a strategy similar to the guidance for biopharmaceuticals for Quality by Design [25] . For each antigen, we identified the key attributes for each that influenced their secretion by host cells and the complexity of a purification process required for recovery. Informed by these heuristics and data collected during characterization of the host cell biology experienced during protein secretion, we designed and tested a limited number of conservative sequence modifications for their impact on protein titers and observed quality attributes. Each design cycle comprised modification of an antigen sequence, generation of a strain, and evaluation of secreted protein titer and product-related variants. Iterative cycles were executed in less than 3 weeks in K. phaffii (Fig. 1d) , enabling the rapid assessment of how variations in sequence motifs impacted several key molecular attributes in the secreted proteins.

Four sites in P [8] were predicted by the NetNGlyc tool [26] to have potential for N-linked glycosylation during protein folding and export (Additional file 1: Table S1 ). We altered the P [8] sequence, therefore, to remove the most confidently predicted glycosylation sites using a conservative, targeted change (NQ).

AA = amino acid. b Percent identity of amino acid sequences between the three subunit antigens. c SDS-PAGE of the initial expression of each NRRV antigen. Expression from two clones is shown for each antigen. d Diagram of a design cycle for sequence engineering expression of P [4] revealed multiple product-related variants with lower molecular weights by SDS-PAGE; these were confirmed by intact MS as four discrete N-terminal truncations (Fig. 3a) . Interestingly, P [8] exhibited less truncation than P [4] despite having an identical N-terminal amino acid sequence (the P2 tetanus epitope). We theorized, therefore, that alternative translation start sites or ribosome skipping did not induce the observed differences in truncation [27, 28] . Alternatively, it has been noted that undesired RNA structures, such as hairpins in nascent mRNA, can cause ribosomal stalls and truncations [29] . We hypothesized that secondary structures in the transcript could impact the variants manifest in the recovered polypeptides. Using RNA structure [30] , we identified an energetically favorable mRNA structure predicted to form near the sites of truncation in P [4] (Fig. 3a) . We modified the codon usage of the P2 tetanus epitope to reduce the strength of the predicted RNA secondary structure while preserving the amino acid sequence (Fig. 3b) . With increasing mitigation of the predicted RNA secondary structure from \u2212 22.8 to \u2212 10.7 kcal/mol, the fraction of full length P [4] in culture supernatant increased from 0% to nearly 60%, while the fraction of the longest truncated variant (V1) increased from 0% to nearly 30%. Overall, the percentage of the antigen that was full-length or nearly full-length (V1) increased from 0% to nearly 90% through improved codon usage alone, confirming that RNA sequence was at least partially responsible for the observed N-terminal truncation. Similar to P [8] , we observed hypermannosylation in the P [4] antigen and we identified sites predicted to be glycosylated. Modification of a single N-linked glycosylation site (N152Q) resulted in comparable titer and product quality as observed for P [8] (Fig. 3c) . Surprisingly, despite strong similarity between P [8] and P [4] , removal of the free cysteine residue (C172S) drastically reduced the secreted expression of P [4] and was not included in the selected optimized sequence.",

Productive secretion of a recombinant protein requires proper mRNA transcription, translation, protein translocation and folding, and vesicular export. This complex, multi-step process makes diagnosis of a particular bottleneck a difficult task [31] . We used transcriptomics to survey differentially expressed genes in the strain expressing the P[6] antigen compared to strains expressing either P [4] and P [8] . The transcripts of P [6] , P [4] , and P [8] each were expressed at comparable levels by their respective strains, indicating transcription is not the rate-limiting step for P [6] (Fig. 4a ). Of all gene sets that were differentially expressed in P[6]-producing cells (Additional file 1: Table S2 ), cytoplasmic translation had the highest enrichment score, followed by gene sets related to cell wall integrity and DNA repair, which are reported signals of stress in K. phaffii (Fig. 4b ) [32] . We hypothesized that disrupted translation may preclude both adequate production of P [6] and proper cell growth and maintenance. We therefore focused our efforts on identifying sequence motifs that could impact protein translation. Similar to our approach with P[4], we first examined the nucleic acid sequence of P [6] for the presence of energetically favorable RNA secondary structures using in silico tools for prediction. We observed a predicted RNA hairpin structure like that in P [4] , but analogous mitigation of this structure did not improve production of P [6] . Upon inspection of the amino acid sequence of P [6] , we noticed several highly hydrophobic amino acid motifs, which have been previously implicated in ribosomal stalling [33] . We altered amino acids near and within hydrophobic regions to reduce local hydrophobicity, but ",

            "text": "To systematically identify candidate sites of translational stalling, we used ribosome profiling, a technique in which ribosome-associated fragments of mRNA are sequenced to determine regions of transcripts that are enriched with ribosomes [34] . We visualized ribosome occupancy at each codon of the recombinant transcript in strains expressing either P [6] or P [4] for comparison (Fig. 4c) . Ribosome occupancy was determined from the number of ribosome footprints that mapped to a particular transcript, after adjusting for both the abundance of the transcript and that of footprints mapping to the native transcriptome. We observed over fourfold higher ribosome occupancy overall on the transcript of P [6] relative to P [4] , which supported our hypothesis of sequence-based translational stall sites in this serotype. We also observed sites with high ribosome occupancy at several positions of P[6] that were not similarly detected at those same positions in P [4] . Most of these positions coincided with local sequence motifs that differed in P [6] from the P [4] and P [8] consensus sequences. We nominated five of these motifs with the largest potential for ribosomal occupancy as likely sites of translational stalling and modified the amino acid sequence of each site to match that of a consensus of P [4] and P [8] sequences. Given the productive secreted expression of P [4] and P [8] , we hypothesized that changing these sites in P [6] to match the P [4] and P [8] sequence could mitigate a translational stall while preserving the structure and antigenicity of the protein. One of these modifications (N92D) resulted in a ~ 2 \u00d7 improvement in the expression of P [6] (Fig. 4d) . The combination of RNA-Seq and ribosome profiling, therefore, enabled us to test a reasonable number of hypotheses and increase the secreted expression of P [6] to levels readily detected by SDS-PAGE with a single substitution of an amino acid.",

We performed bio-layer interferometry as a measure of the secondary structure of each serotype using monoclonal antibodies specific to each (Fig. 5a ). All but one of the altered sequences had a minimal effect on binding affinity to the antibodies, suggesting that the modified variants retained antigenicity comparable to the reference sequences. Interestingly, the removal of the free cysteine residue of P [4] significantly altered the binding affinity of this variant, in addition to reducing expression (Fig. 3c, Fig. S1 can interfere with the structure of a protein, and that alterations need to balance both objectives for antigenicity and manufacturability. We then evaluated whether the selected engineered antigens maintained their immunogenicity, since the modified sequences may disrupt key linear or conformational epitopes that promote immune responses. We compared the ability of the engineered antigens for each serotype to induce the production of neutralizing antibodies in guinea pigs relative to the original sequences produced in bacteria. We selected one engineered antigen per serotype having the best observed titer and quality (Fig. 5a) . We produced these three engineered antigens, alongside a control having the original P [4] sequence, by secreted expression in K. phaffii and purified the proteins to assess their immunogenicity in adjuvanted doses. Groups of guinea pigs were vaccinated with the engineered antigens produced in K. phaffii, and compared directly to groups that were vaccinated with antigens produced in E. coli having the original sequences [20] . We measured the titers of neutralizing antibodies present in serum collected from all animals in our study after three administered doses. The measured titers of neutralizing antibodies raised in response to our engineered antigens were not significantly different from titers raised by the original antigens for all three serotypes (Fig. 5b-d) . Interestingly, we observed cross neutralization among serotypes for both engineered and original antigens (Additional file 1: Fig. S5A-C) , evident by the strong neutralizing activity against P[4] virus using sera from groups vaccinated with P [6] . This cross neutralization was also evident in antigen-specific ELI-SAs, which confirmed general cross reactivity among the serotypes (Additional file 1: Fig. S5D ). Cross reactivity is expected given the high homologies and biophysical similarities among serotypes, and may contribute to the broadly neutralizing responses achieved by the trivalent vaccine [17] . These results suggested that the engineering changes to the three antigens implemented to improve manufacturability did not significantly alter their immunogenicity in this model.",

Multi-valent subunit vaccines, in general, are strong candidates for co-purification because antigen serotypes often have similar biophysical characteristics, and integrated production could reduce the total number of manufacturing campaigns required. We previously demonstrated an integrated, continuous manufacturing system for producing biopharmaceutical proteins (InSCyT) [36] . Two core elements-microbial perfusion-based fermentation and integrated chromatographic operations [37, 38] -made it possible to rapidly and simultaneously develop processes for production and recovery on this system. We first developed a single process for perfusion-based fermentation based on our prior experience producing similar molecules, and executed it to produce each antigen individually ( Fig. S6A-C) . Starting from processes reported previously [36] , we then developed a process for purification comprising a multimodal cation exchange capture resin for the removal of host-cell proteins followed by an anion exchange resin for the removal of host-cell DNA. The same two-step process was sufficient to recover each of the three individual antigens and remove residual hostcell proteins to below 500 ppm and DNA below the limit of detection of our assay (Fig. S6D-G) . Product-related variants were already sufficiently minimized by sequence engineering such that no additional purification steps were required.",

After each transformation of a new transgene, secreted expression of the antigen was verified by SDS-PAGE (Additional file 1: Fig. S7A-B) . We then used this strain producing all three antigens in the InSCyT system (Fig. 6b) . Cells were cultivated in perfusion fermentation, and the perfusate was subsequently purified in two steps by multimodal cation exchange chromatography followed by anion exchange chromatography, as performed before for the individual antigens. Production of all three serotypes was sustained over 108 h, and the relative ratios of each serotype were largely preserved throughout the campaign (Fig. 6c) . Successful co-expression and copurification of all three serotypes were confirmed by IEF (Fig. 6d) and LC-MS (Fig. 6e) . Process-related impurities including host-cell proteins and host-cell DNA were reduced in the chromatographic operations below typical regulatory guidelines (Additional file 1: Fig. S7C,D) .

This approach relies on rational analysis using a combination of natural variations of the sequence and genome-scale analysis of the host for expression. This proof-of-concept study demonstrates that disparate antigen candidates can be intentionally designed to conform to a common process for manufacturing, like those operated on the InSCyT manufacturing system here. Our approach to address molecular variants impacting the quality of the antigens at the amino acid sequence level was demonstrated by simple mitigation of N-linked glycosylation and dimerization in P [8] . Identification of a small number of critical amino acid residues allowed rapid screening of exhaustive sequence variations, yielding a strongly expressed antigen with no major product-related variants. Free cysteine residues in model proteins have been shown to covalently bind to pharmaceutical additives such as thimerosal, a commonly used preservative in multi-dose formulations [39] . We confirmed subsequently (and described elsewhere) that removing the free cysteine residue from P [8] Fig. 6 Sequence engineering enables sustained production of a trivalent NRRV vaccine from a single strain in a single manufacturing campaign. a Construction and testing of a strain that expresses all three NRRV antigens. b Cell density across the manufacturing campaign.

The N-terminal truncations observed when expressing the original P [4] sequence are characteristic of promiscuous serine proteases; several of which are conserved in yeasts [42] . Based on our results, we hypothesized that mRNA secondary structures may slow translation and translocation, allowing increased cytoplasmic protease activity. Silent mutations have previously been demonstrated to impact product quality in biopharmaceutical manufacturing [43] , and this potential mechanism merits further consideration in future studies. The connection between mRNA structure and protein truncation, nevertheless, demonstrates a key relationship through which truncated variants may be mitigated.",

We did not identify a canonical ribosomal stall site, as such sites can be specific to the organism, and translation of exogenous genes in most biomanufacturing host organisms is not well understood [44] . Ribosome profiling as a technique, however, is agnostic to the mechanism of translational failure, and enabled us to identify a non-canonical site of translational stalling. Ribosome profiling captures data regarding all abundant transcripts in a single initial experiment, so future efforts could be focused to identify, and ultimately predict, translational preferences and stall sites that are specific to the host [45] . In this case, a modest substitution from the P [4] and P [8] sequence likely restored efficient translation of the P [6] transcript, though we were unable to identify the exact mechanism of failure.",

Pathogens mutate T-cell epitopes or sequence-specific protease sites to facilitate evolutionary escape from antigen presentation to CD4 + T-cells [46] . Primary sequence changes may also alter secondary and tertiary structures that create discontinuous or conformational epitopes [47, 48] . We recently demonstrated that physicochemical properties of the candidate antigens here are sensitive to single \"weak spot\" residues that may also impact antigenicity [49] . For these reasons, and as demonstrated here, conservative, isolated amino acid mutations are preferable to sequence-wide screening because they reduce the probability of disrupting unknown antigenic epitopes. The ability of our engineered antigens to induce neutralizing antibodies in guinea pigs validates the viability of our approach, and suggests it could apply to vaccine candidates still in the early stages of discovery to facilitate future translational development.",

Separately, the accessibility of -omics data is exceptional for yeasts and other eukaryotic hosts, which enables further understanding of host biology for identifying rational host-dependent changes for product sequences [52] . This accessibility paired with the speed of cultivation and screening for expression suggests that yeast like K. phaffii are uniquely suited for the development of subunit vaccines.

About 20 pmol of each sample was injected, bound to a ZORBAX 300SB C3 column (Agilent Technologies), desalted, and subjected to electrospray ionization. The LC gradient consisted of 20-70% B over 1 min at a flow rate of 1.5 mL/ min. Elution of proteins was monitored using the absorbance signal at 214 nm. 50 \u00b5L of isopropanol was injected after each sample to control sample carry-over. The typical electrospray ionization parameters consisted of: 290 \u00b0C gas temperature, 4000 V Vcap, 2000 V nozzle, and 275 V fragmentor voltage. Mass spectra were collected from 700 to 2800 m/z at a scan rate of 1 spectra/sec.
