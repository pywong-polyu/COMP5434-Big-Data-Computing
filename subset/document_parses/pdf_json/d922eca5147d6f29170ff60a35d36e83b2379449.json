In the general population, respiratory-related event is one of the most common causes of unexpected ICU readmission. Patients with neurological deficits faced an increased risks of ICU readmissions due to impaired mentation, protective reflexes and other factors. A retrospective review revealed that the leading cause of unexpected ICU readmissions in adult neurovascular patients admitted to our hospital was respiratory related. A respiratory therapists-driven assessment-and-treat protocol was developed for proactively assessing and treating adult neurovascular patients. On-duty respiratory therapists assessed all neurovascular patients on admission, assigned a respiratory severity score to each patient and then recommended interventions based on a standardised algorithm. Our quality improvement initiative had no effect on the rate of unexpected ICU readmissions in adult neurovascular patients. When compared with the baseline population, patients enrolled in the intervention group were significantly older ((79, 68-85 years) vs (71, 56-81 years)), but they spent comparable amount of time in the ICU (4.5 vs 4 days, p=0.42). When the respiratory severity score was trended in the intervention group, patients demonstrated significant improvement in their respiratory function, with a greater proportion of patients scoring in the minimal and mild categories and smaller proportion in the moderate category (p<0.01).",

The review discovered that respiratory-related event was the major cause of unexpected ICU readmissions and that patients received respiratory assessment and/or intervention only when they experienced respiratory-related events, indicating a potential area for improvement. UPMC Mercy is located within Pittsburgh's downtown and is one of the UPMC system's three quaternary flagship hospitals, serving a large catchment area of western Pennsylvania and neighbouring states. The amount of adult neurovascular patients admitted annually frequently exceed 1000, creating a busy and high turnover working environment. While our project team recognised that the environment and some staffing concerns might become the obstacles to implement this quality improvement (QI) project, it was believed that by putting respiratory therapists (RTs) in charge of the process could streamline the protocol implementation and provide benefits to this patient group. The project's objective was to provide proactive respiratory assessment and interventions according to a predefined algorithm to every adult neurovascular patient on their admission day. Our aim is that by implementing this protocol, we will be able to reduce the rate of unexpected ICU readmissions due to respiratory-related events.",

[3] [4] [5] Numerous risk factors for unexpected ICU readmissions have been identified, including advanced Open access age, the need for mechanical ventilation, vasopressor use, premorbid conditions, the presence of healthcare trainees, dysphagia at the discharge from ICU and the severity of the illness. 1 6-8 Moreover, additional efforts were made to construct predictive models based on previously identified risk factors, yet the overall applicability of the models remained low. 9 Lastly, increased clinical experience did not improve physicians' ability to predict ICU readmissions. 10 Additional research is warranted to advance this area, which is full of unanswered mysteries.",

A key lesson learnt during the process was the importance of identifying key stakeholders from diverse backgrounds (attending physician, nurse, RT, fellow physician and resident physician), who assisted in ensuring the protocol was activated and implemented effectively. The multidisciplinary collaboration established the groundwork for the improvement process; prior to developing our protocol, we successfully identified stakeholders from the diverse backgrounds.

During our enrolment phase, UPMC Mercy transitioned to become the primary receiving centre within the UPMC system for adult neurovascular patients over the age of 75 as a result of another QI initiative to improve quality metrics in stroke patient population. As a result, patients in the intervention group were significantly older and more likely to have complex comorbidities which raised their risk of unexpected ICU readmissions. However, we were able to maintain a similar rate of unexpected ICU admissions in the intervention group with the RTDAT protocol, and the patients enrolled had considerably improved outcome. Notably, the respiratory severity scores of patients in the intervention group also improved significantly, further supporting the efficacy of our RTDAT protocol. Additionally, the RTDAT protocol may have some additional advantages. The Neuro-ICU is always short of beds due to the increasing number of interventional and neurosurgical cases. By minimising the unexpected ICU readmissions, our RTDAT protocol may help optimise patient flow and the availability of beds. Even though this QI initiative did not reduce respiratoryrelated ICU readmissions, our RTDAT protocol was adopted by the hospital and implemented regularly on every adult neurovascular patient admitted to UPMC Mercy.",

We were unable to validate all intervention modalities and frequencies provided by the RTs in the EMR. In retrospect, we should have mandated this being documented in daily progress note. Due to the observational nature of this project, it was also susceptible to biases and confounding variables. In our study, for example, patients in the intervention group were older than those in the baseline group. As we all know, age is highly correlated with ICU readmission, owing to the fact that older patients tend to have higher prevalence of comorbidities and lower reserve. Additionally, while we were unbale to verify all the interventions in the EMR, the assessment and interventions provided in the intervention group adhered strictly to the preestablished algorithm, whereas the respiratory assessments conducted in the review period were completely random. Additionally, we were unable to alter physicians' discharge practice pattern. Borderline patients may have been prematurely discharged to the neurology ward due to ICU bed requests for incoming patients. During the review and implementation phase of this project, there was no physician turnover, however it remained unknown what effect physicians' discharge practice pattern might have had on the outcomes. Finally, generalising our findings to other ICU patient populations may be challenging because our patient cohort was limited to adult neurovascular patients.",
