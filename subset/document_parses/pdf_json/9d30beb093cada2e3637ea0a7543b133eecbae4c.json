            "text": "SARS-CoV-2 is a single stranded RNA (ssRNA) virus and contains GU-rich sequences distributed abundantly in the genome. In COVID-19, the infection and immune hyperactivation causes accumulation of inflammatory immune cells, blood clots, and protein aggregates in lung fluid, increased lung alveolar wall thickness, and upregulation of serum cytokine levels. A serum protein called serum amyloid P (SAP) has a calming effect on the innate immune system and shows efficacy as a therapeutic for fibrosis in animal models and clinical trials. In this report, we show that aspiration of the GU-rich ssRNA oligonucleotide ORN06 into mouse lungs induces all of the above COVID-19-like symptoms. Men tend to have more severe COVID-19 symptoms than women, and in the aspirated ORN06 model, male mice tended to have more severe symptoms than female mice. Intraperitoneal injections of SAP starting from day 1 post ORN06 aspiration attenuated the ORN06-induced increase in the number of inflammatory cells and formation of clot-like aggregates in the mouse lung fluid, reduced ORN06-increased alveolar wall thickness and accumulation of exudates in the alveolar airspace, and attenuated an ORN06induced upregulation of the inflammatory cytokines IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-12p70, IL-23, and IL-27 in serum. Together, these results suggest that aspiration of ORN06 is a simple model for both COVID-19 as well as cytokine storm in general, and that SAP is a potential therapeutic for diseases with COVID-19-like symptoms as well as diseases that generate a cytokine storm.",

Human patients and murine models of SARS-CoV, MERS, and SARS-CoV2 indicate that severe disease may be triggered by a cytokine storm, in which, as in other cytokine storm associated diseases, an over exuberant production of cytokines leads to the accumulation of immune cells in sensitive organs such as the lungs (2, 3) . Although there are similar numbers of confirmed SARS-CoV2 cases between men and women, severe COVID-19 disease, as measured by hospitalization, admission to intensive care units, and rates of mortality, are 1.5 to 2 times higher in men than women (4) (5) (6) (7) . These data are independent of other known factors, such as smoking, diabetes, obesity, heart disease, chronic kidney disease, or chronic lung disease (7, 8) .",

Serum amyloid P (SAP; PTX2) is a member of the pentraxin family of proteins that includes C-reactive protein (CRP; PTX1) and pentraxin-3 (PTX3). SAP is made by hepatocytes and secreted into the blood (19, 20) . SAP binds to a variety of molecules including DNA and apoptotic debris, bacterial polysaccharides, amyloid deposits, and bacterial and viral proteins (21-23). Phagocytic cells such as monocytes and macrophages then bind the SAP and engulf the debris or other material the pentraxin has bound (24). SAP binds to Fc receptors (receptors for IgG) as well as the C-type lectin receptor DC-SIGN/CD209 on monocytes and macrophages (24-28), and inhibits the formation of pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic macrophages, and promotes the formation of immuno-regulatory macrophages (29) (30) (31) (32) (33) (34) (35) (36) (37) (38) (39) (40) . In addition to promoting the formation of immuno-regulatory macrophages, SAP induces macrophages to secrete the antiinflammatory cytokine IL-10 (34, 35, 41) . SAP decreases neutrophil binding to extracellular matrix components (42) (43) (44) , and in a mouse model of lung inflammation, SAP injections starting 24 hours after insult reduced the number of neutrophils in the lungs (44) . In animal models and human clinical trials, SAP inhibits fibrosis (30, 35, [45] [46] [47] . SAP is also effective as an inhibitor of influenza A virus infections (48) (49) (50) .",

Aspiration of ORN06 also led to the formation of clot-like aggregates in some male mouse lung fluids. ORN06 aspiration increased levels of CD11b+, CD11c+, and CD45+ macrophages, CD3-lymphocytes, but not Ly6G positive neutrophils in the lungs, and upregulated IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-12p70, IL-23, and IL-27 in the serum. We also observed differences in the response to ORN06 between male and female mice. Unlike tail vein injection, aspiration of the GU-rich ssRNA did not induce death of the mice over 72 hours (51) . In mice treated with aspirated ORN06, injections of SAP attenuated lung inflammation, alveolar wall thickening, the presence of lung exudates and clotlike aggregates, and elevated serum cytokines induced by ORN06 aspiration. These results suggest that ORN06 aspiration mimics some of the characteristics of COVID-19, and that SAP could be a potential therapeutic for severe COVID-19 disease and other conditions where a cytokine storm is a clinical problem.",

In the BAL, patients with severe COVID-19 have more macrophages than mild cases or healthy controls, and the increased macrophage numbers appear to be due to the presence of recruited monocyte-derived inflammatory macrophages (17, [72] [73] [74] . We found that ORN06-induced increases in BALF cell counts were mirrored by an increase in CD11c+ and CD45+ cells with the morphology of macrophages, suggesting that ORN06 stimulates the accumulation of CD11c+CD45+ alveolar macrophages, but whether this is due to the proliferation of resident alveolar macrophages, migration of CD11c+CD45+ interstitial macrophages into the alveoli, or a rapid phenotypic conversion of recruited CD11b+CD11c-to CD11b-CD11c+ macrophages is unknown (75, 76) . Aspiration of ORN06 led to increased numbers of CD11b+, CD11c+, and CD45+ cells, but not Mac2/Gal3 positive cells, retained in the lungs after BAL. As Mac2/Gal3 is a marker for tissue resident lung macrophages (65) , these data suggest that ORN06 generates a response that induces the recruitment of CD11b+CD45+ inflammatory macrophages, which may undergo phenotypic conversion to CD11b-CD11c+CD45+ macrophages, and/or ORN06 induces the proliferation of lung resident CD11c+CD45+ interstitial macrophages (75-77). Injections of SAP attenuated the accumulation of macrophages in both the BAL fluid and in the post-BAL lung tissue. These data suggest that SAP can be used to target the recruited macrophage populations without altering the tissue resident macrophages, or elevating the neutrophils in the lung.",

NK cells and other ILCs are potent producers of a variety of cytokines, depending on the subtype of ILCs, stimulus, and tissue where the ILCs are found, but how the changes in the number and composition of ILCs subsets affect cytokine levels in COVID-19 is still unclear (1, 81) . COVID-19 is also characterized by a \"cytokine storm\" with increased levels of proinflammatory cytokines in the blood, such as IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, IL-12 (67, 70, 71, 82) , and we detected increased IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-12, IL-23, and IL-27 in the serum following ORN06 aspiration. Injections of SAP attenuated the increased levels of the above cytokines, suggesting that SAP can either induce cells to degrade extracellular cytokines, or inhibit cells from secreting cytokines the above cytokines. SAP also elevated the serum levels of the \"anti-inflammatory cytokine\" IL-10, as observed previously (27, 35, 41) . Previous studies suggest that IL-17A plays an important role in enhancing antiviral T helper type 1 responses in the female genital tract, where female mice lacking IL-17A have lower proportions of IFN-\u03b3+ T h 1 cells than wild type female mice (83) . Compared to male mice, female mouse bladders have higher IL-17 expression (84) .We observed that ORN06 decreased serum IL-17A in female but not male mice, and that SAP reversed the ORN06 effect in female mice. Together, this suggests that SAP can reverse the effects of ORN06 on several serum cytokines.",
