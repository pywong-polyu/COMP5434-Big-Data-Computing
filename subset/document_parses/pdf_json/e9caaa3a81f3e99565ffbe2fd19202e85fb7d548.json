Clinical research trials around the world are underway testing a wide array of possible medications. In particular, the off-label use of hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19 prophylaxis and treatment has created many unprecedented challenges for the scientific community and the public. Areas covered: We critically assessed major events from February -May 2020 that contributed to widespread use of hydroxychloroquine for the treatment and prophylaxis of COVID-19. We aimed to explore how opinions toward hydroxychloroquine may shift from early enthusiasm (based on in vitro and preliminary clinical data) to the hope for a miracle cure (through communication and promotion of questionable results) and, finally, to a rise of skepticism as more in-depth analyses are emerging. Expert opinion: Mindful and rigorous acquisition of data, as well as its interpretation, are essential to an effective pandemic response. The rapid and premature promotion of results has had major implications for global crisis management, even creating distrust among the public. It is crucial for the medical and scientific community to incorporate the lessons learned from this situation.",

In the midst of a global health disaster, there has been a collective race to find safe and effective treatments. The use of preprints as a medium of rapid scientific communication has surged in recent months in order to expedite the availability of study results, though not without peril. Preprints have not been peer-reviewed at the time of online distribution, vary in quality, and some may never be published in a peer-reviewed scientific journal. The use of chloroquine (CQ) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) for COVID-19 exemplifies the risks of both overinterpreting and amplifying preliminary data by those outside of the scientific community and was followed by swift corrective measures by researchers. This may represent the most rapid medical reversal in recent history, a full 'pendulum swing' from early enthusiasm to wide skepticism. In this report, we analyze the evolving waves of discourse regarding CQ/HCQ in relation to COVID-19, lessons learned, and implications for the future (Figure 1 ).",

On March 19, President Trump endorsed HCQ for the treatment of COVID-19 in a press conference and commented on the drug's presumed safety in this setting as 'if things don't go as planned, it's not going to kill anybody' [9] . The study by Raoult and colleagues was published as a preprint on March 20 and received immediate and at times uncritical media attention, as well as criticism from the scientific medical community regarding the study design and outcomes [10, 11] . Following this, Trump posted on Twitter on March 21 describing the combination of HCQ and AZM potentially being 'one of the biggest gamechangers in the history of medicine', also mentioning the Federal Drug Administration (FDA) efforts to approve combination and quoting data presented in the International Journal of Antimicrobial Agents [12] . Concurrently, new HCQ prescriptions for COVID-19 surged for both therapeutic and prophylactic use [13] . Without prior stockpiling, drug shortages quickly ensued [11, 14] . Patients with rheumatic diseases appeared on news outlets and social media to shed light on the implications of HCQ and CQ drug shortages. In the same week, multiple state public health agencies and regulatory boards attempted to protect the HCQ supply chain by restricting prescriptions, for both COVID-19 and rheumatic diseases [15] . Multiple rheumatology organizations and governmental institutions also released guiding statements regarding scarce resource allocation during the pandemic [16] [17] [18] [19] .",

With the increasing interest and examples of the irrational use of HCQ, physicians and rheumatologists raised concerns about the increasing use of HCQ and the inevitable impact on patients who rely on this medication [24] [25] [26] . However, the FDA issued an emergency use authorization (EUA) for the use of HCQ and CQ in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 on March 28 [27] . On March 31, HCQ was added to the FDA drug shortage list with several companies reporting limited supplies [28] .",

Although their study did not find a difference in short-term outcomes with 30-day follow-up, they did detect a concerning safety signal: HCQ combined with AZM was associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular death, angina, and heart failure. Further studies assessing HCQ with or without AZM on QT prolongation in COVID-19 patients emerged [35] .

On May 7 and 11, two large observational studies of hospitalized COVID-19 patients in New York found nonsignificant associations between the use of HCQ and major outcomes such as intubation or death, or in-hospital mortality [44, 45] . Two studies were published on May 14: a negative open-label RCT of HCQ versus standard of care on the outcome of seroconversion at 28 days, and an observational study of patients requiring supplemental oxygen for COVID-19 that did not demonstrate a significant association between the use of HCQ versus no HCQ on the outcome of survival without ICU transfer within 21 days [46, 47] . Counter to this new evidence, on May 18 Trump announced at a press conference that he was personally taking HCQ for the prevention of COVID-19. He cited anecdotes that frontline healthcare workers were doing the same [48] . On May 22, an observational study using purported deidentified international registry data on nearly 100,000 patients with COVID-19 found an increased risk of mortality and new arrhythmias for HCQ or CQ alone, and either antimalarial in combination with a macrolide, versus comparators, receiving neither an antimalarial nor a macrolide [49] .",

Public support for the use of HCQ as a cure for COVID-19 has put patients on these medications in danger as a massive influx of people tried to access HCQ who did not have prior prescriptions. Patients already on HCQ were facing shortages and some were questioning if they should alter their doses. Some wanted to decrease the risks that they would contract COVID-19 while others were seeking to lower their doses in the face of obstacles to receiving their prescriptions.

The widespread use of pre-print publications has highlighted the importance of adequate peer review, but also highlighted the value of the 'community review' of pre-prints when formal peer review has failed. With the contracted process from data collection to publication, the continued promotion of publication ethics is important to protect scientific integrity and trust in the system.",

Media, including social media, are powerful tools of dissemination. As experienced during this crisis, the handling of data dissemination is critical and can have an either positive or negative impact in the public's image of the scientific community. As the COVID-19 pandemic persists in the coming months, the scientific community must reemerge as a reliable source for guidance in interpreting the evolving knowledge base. This should be accomplished in tandem with stakeholders, such as patient advocates and public health officials, to carefully and effectively communicate findings to a wide audience.",
