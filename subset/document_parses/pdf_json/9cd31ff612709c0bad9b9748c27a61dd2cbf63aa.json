Therefore, the impact of broadband availability on rural development is evaluated more accurately than previously. The results of the Difference-indifference (DiD) regression analysis show that the availability of broadband reduces depopulation of remote and sparsely populated rural areas. In this respect, the telecommunication policy in Finland has been successful, and the findings encourage the expansion of broadband infrastructure in rural areas.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "The expansion of broadband and the development of high-speed networks are for the most part focused on urban areas where the potential profits are higher for private-sector firms. The uneven development of the availability of broadband creates a digital divide where rural areas run the risk of being left behind in the use of information and communication technologies (Dickes et al., 2010) . With broadband, it is possible to secure and increase housing opportunities and services in rural areas. The high-speed broadband connections will, for instance, improve opportunities for rural residents and entrepreneurs to use e-services, telemedicine and telecommuting (Townsend et al., 2013) . The broadband connections can also potentially reduce the locational disadvantage of the distant rural areas (Lehtonen & Tykkyl\u00e4inen, 2010) by improving their relational connections to growth areas and offering market access. Thus, the expansion of broadband for rural areas is a key element ensuring the regional competitiveness of the rural areas. From a regional equality perspective, there are justifiable reasons for public support of expansion projects in broadband construction as regional differences in the availability of broadband have remained wide. Research has shown that broadband is most often missing in remote and sparsely populated rural areas, which are not attractive areas for commercial operators (Koutsouris, 2010; Townsend et al., 2013; Pyyk\u00f6nen & Lehtonen, 2016) . The digital divide is a result of the higher construction cost of broadband in rural areas per customer than in urban areas, which is why the potential customer base is lower in rural areas and makes it even more difficult to anticipate rural broadband expansion. In the rural areas, the lack of broadband exacerbates the digital divide because it is often in these areas that the benefits of broadband could be the greatest since they are located far away from the physical services. Therefore, digital services could increase the opportunities to use services regardless of time and place in these otherwise service-poor environments (Pyyk\u00f6nen & Lehtonen, 2016 In this study, GIS database is used to examine how the availability of broadband in Finland is related to the population development of the rural areas in the period 2010-2018. The aim is to increase the understanding of the impact of broadband availability on rural depopulation and thereby generally evaluate the use of public funding regarding the expansion of broadband in sparsely populated areas and overall telecommunication policy in Finland. The assumed chain of the impact of broadband expansion stems from public funding, which makes it possible to expand broadband and improve the availability of broadband in rural areas, thus boosting local economies and labour markets and finally leading to a more positive population development in the rural areas. However, the theory and empirical evidence on the effect of broadband expansion in rural areas are far less certain.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 370, "end": 391, "text": "(Dickes et al., 2010)", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 666, "end": 689, "text": "(Townsend et al., 2013)", "ref_id": "BIBREF45"}, {"start": 801, "end": 831, "text": "(Lehtonen & Tykkyl\u00e4inen, 2010)", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 1412, "end": 1430, "text": "(Koutsouris, 2010;", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 1431, "end": 1453, "text": "Townsend et al., 2013;", "ref_id": "BIBREF45"}, {"start": 1454, "end": 1480, "text": "Pyyk\u00f6nen & Lehtonen, 2016)", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 2119, "end": 2145, "text": "(Pyyk\u00f6nen & Lehtonen, 2016", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "The study differs from previous studies in that it uses an accurate GIS database on the availability of broadband, and therefore, the impact of broadband availability on rural population development can be evaluated much more accurately than previously.

Koutsouris (2010) notices that the investments in rural areas worldwide remain behind those made in urban areas, and the last mile connectivity stays poor, which has been one of the arguments for public support. In addition to the availability of broadband, the benefits of connecting to households and businesses when the connection is available in the area are important. The deployment of broadband is not taking place at the same pace as its availability. The use of broadband appears to be influenced by the educational level of the population, household income, age, previous experience with the use of information technology and the construction cost of broadband (Carare et al., 2015; Whitacre et al., 2014; LaRose, Strover, Gregg, & Straubhaar, 2011) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 425, "end": 448, "text": "(Townsend et al., 2013)", "ref_id": "BIBREF45"}, {"start": 451, "end": 468, "text": "Koutsouris (2010)", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 1122, "end": 1143, "text": "(Carare et al., 2015;", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1144, "end": 1166, "text": "Whitacre et al., 2014;", "ref_id": "BIBREF49"}, {"start": 1167, "end": 1210, "text": "LaRose, Strover, Gregg, & Straubhaar, 2011)", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Importance of broadband for areas"}, {"text": "From a housing perspective, the rural municipalities with broadband connections may be more pleasant places to live and work than those without them (Townsend et al., 2013) .

In this way broadband expansion protects rural areas from depopulation but based on empirical findings it does not contribute to a further closing of the economic divide in the form of creating new jobs (Briglauer et al., 2018) . In rural areas, broadband connections are essential for housing because digitalization improves the availability and accessibility of services in a diminishing rural physical service network. Therefore, broadband connections are a crucial part of the basic infrastructure comparable to roads and electricity, without which it is difficult to cope (Salemink et al., 2017; Skerratt et al., 2012) .

Thus, the construction of broadband connections can have positive effects later on, for example, population development, employment, income and job creation (Prieger, 2013; Forzati et al., 2012; Atasoy, 2013; M\u00f6lleryd, 2015) . The construction of broadband, particularly in rural areas, is seen as important as it creates opportunities for economic growth and business development in the area.

According to the analysis of Stenberg et al., (2009) , employment has grown faster in the areas with better Internet broadband. However, Galloway (2007) concludes that broadband access alone will not change the trend of rural economic development, and funding and promotion of it in isolation will be wasted if there is no development of firm motivations and skills for business.

Thus, it seems that based on the availability map, local activity is sufficient to cover only part of the country with broadband but it also indicated that fragmentation may be influenced by the inactivity of some municipalities in supporting local broadband development and the institutional and cultural features of these types of areas, which do not favor broadband construction based on local project activities such as village activities.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 905, "end": 911, "text": "Fig. 1", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}], "section": "O.

The GIS database comprised from population grids makes it possible to formulate analyses independent of administrative boundaries, which is a reason why their use has become more popular in recent years, for instance, in planning public services (Kotavaara et al., 2011) . Performing spatial population analysis independent from administrative boundaries helps to avoid several methodological pitfalls, such as the effect of \"urban spillover\" (Amcoff, 2006) or large administrative units covering disparate areas: in Finland, especially in the eastern and northern parts of the country, municipalities cover large areas which may be predominantly deserted but contain municipal towns where local populations are concentrated (Kauppila & Rusanen, 2009) .
