This study aims to assess the impact of COVID-19 lockdown on the incidence of the most common skeletal injuries and to provide a management algorithm specific for hospitalized fractured patients. We comparatively analysed the Emergency Department (ED) admissions between March 9th and May 4th 2020 with the same period in 2019. The frequency of the most common skeletal injuries has been derived. Data from the pre-hospitalization phase to discharge of all patients were considered. The impact on clinical orthopaedic consulting has been evaluated. All patients requiring orthopaedic care followed different pathways of hospitalization based on COVID positivity. Data of surgical activity has been analysed. During the 9 weeks of lockdown the access of patients to ED drastically decreased: 11726 accesses compared to 21501 in the same period of 2019. This trend was followed by the most common skeletal injuries but not by proximal femur fracture (PFF) that showed the same absolute numbers compare to the previous years (64 vs 63). If analysed in relation to the total ED access, PFF showed a relatively increase in their frequency. The data from this experience suggest that healthcare providers should strategically allocate resources for management and treatment of PFF during the COVID-19 pandemic. With the begin of the reopening phase, a \"rebound effect\" for orthopaedic care was observed leading to delayed treatments with a potential overall increased morbidity. (www.actabiomedica.it)",

In response to this unprecedented event, on March 9th the Italian Government ordered a nationwide lockdown for 9 weeks, limiting people's movement as a preventive measure. This followed an earlier restriction announced on previous days which affected sixteen million people including the whole region of Lombardy and fourteen provinces in Veneto, Piemonte and Emilia-Romagna. No health care system was prepared for an event of this magnitude: hospitals and primary care providers optimized their strategic resources, increased the efficiency and safety of triage capacity, boost test availability and designed a proper logistic for Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) and ventilators distribution. Specific guidelines have been developed in different countries and regions (2, 3) . Despite this incredibly demanding situation for the health care system, several medical and surgical conditions, like traumatic injuries and bone fragility fractures, still required immediate assessment and timely resolution (4) .",

This approach is justified by the important rate of a false-negative -up to 30% -that has been recorded in several experience (7) .

We found that the total numbers of proximal femur fractures remain stable, with an increase of their relative frequency on total ED access.
