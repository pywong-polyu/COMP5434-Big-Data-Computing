            "text": "The opportunistic pathogen Staphylococcus aureus is responsible for causing infections related to indwelling medical devices, where this pathogen is able to attach and form biofilms. The intrinsic properties given by the self-produced extracellular biofilm matrix confer high resistance to antibiotics, triggering infections difficult to treat. Therefore, novel antibiofilm strategies targeting matrix components are urgently needed. The Biofilm Associated Protein, Bap, expressed by staphylococcal species adopts functional amyloid-like structures as scaffolds of the biofilm matrix. In this work we have focused on identifying agents targeting Bap-related amyloid-like aggregates as a strategy to combat S. aureus biofilm-related infections. We identified that the flavonoids, quercetin, myricetin and scutellarein specifically inhibited Bap-mediated biofilm formation of S. aureus and other staphylococcal species. By using in vitro aggregation assays and the cell-based methodology for generation of amyloid aggregates based on the Curli-Dependent Amyloid Generator system (C-DAG), we demonstrated that these polyphenols prevented the assembly of Bap-related amyloid-like structures. Finally, using an in vivo catheter infection model, we showed that quercetin and myricetin significantly reduced catheter colonization by S. aureus. These results support the use of polyphenols as anti-amyloids molecules that can be used to treat biofilm-related infections.",

MIC against S. aureus V329 were 375 \u03bcg/ml for curcumin, 500 \u03bcg/ml for quercetin, scutellarein and genistein, 750 \u03bcg/ml for eriodictyol, 1000 \u03bcg/ml for myricetin, baicalein and resveratrol and 2500 \u03bcg/ ml for gallic acid. Next, we tested the antibiofilm effect of the polyphenols on S. aureus V329 biofilm administered at sub-MIC dosages. As expected none of the polyphenols at the concentrations tested affected bacterial viability (Fig. S2) . In order to identify polyphenols that specifically inhibit Bap-dependent biofilm formation, we included the S. aureus 15981 strain (bap negative), which formed a polysaccharide (PNAG)-dependent biofilm, as a control. After cultivation of S. aureus V329 and 15981 strains in the presence of 1/50x MIC, 1/100x MIC and 1/500x MIC of the polyphenols, biofilms were stained with crystal violet. Results showed that myricetin (MC), baicalein (BC), and scutellarein (SC) strongly inhibited biofilm formation of S. aureus V329 at 1/50x MIC (MC 20 \u03bcg/ ml, BC 20 \u03bcg/ml and SC 10 \u03bcg/ml) with a percentage of biofilm inhibition of 94% \u00b1 1%, 91% \u00b1 3%, 92% \u00b1 3%, respectively and 1/100x MIC (MC 10 \u03bcg/ml, BC 10 \u03bcg/ml and SC 5 \u03bcg/ml) with a percentage of biofilm reduction of 92% \u00b1 4%, 69% \u00b1 21%, 84% \u00b1 1%, respectively (***P < 0.001, **P < 0.01, *P < 0.05) (Fig. 1A,B) . Quercetin (QC) significantly reduced biofilm at 1/50x MIC (10 \u03bcg/ml) with a percentage of biofilm inhibition of 75 \u00b1 2 (**P < 0.01). Only genistein (GN) (10 \u03bcg/ml) and baicalein (BC) (20 \u03bcg/ml) significantly reduced biofilm of S. aureus 15981 (**P < 0.01, *P < 0.05) (Fig. 1A,B) . With these results, we have established that the minimal biofilm inhibitory concentrations (MBIC) of polyphenols to inhibit biofilms in which Bap is a matrix component are 10 \u03bcg/ml for QC, 10 \u03bcg/ml for MC and 5 \u03bcg/ml for SC, respectively.",

We used the xCEL-Ligence impedance system to quantitatively evaluate the antibiofilm effect of the polyphenols on the S. aureus strains V329 and 15981 on real-time. When the polyphenols QC, MC, BC and SC were added into the culture medium at the MBIC (10 \u03bcg/ml for QC, MC, BC, and 5 \u03bcg/ml for SC, respectively), a significant reduction in the biofilm mass of S. aureus V329 was observed. Specifically, QC, MC, BC and SC inhibited S. aureus V329 biofilm formation by 37% \u00b1 0.25%, 39% \u00b1 0.09%, 58% \u00b1 0.19% and 50% \u00b1 0.23%, respectively (Fig. 3A ).

In the case of S. aureus 15981, the addition of QC, MC and SC resulted in a biofilm growth delay that did not cause a significant reduction in the CI values after 48 h of growth ( Fig. 3B ). Only BC inhibited biofilm formation of 15981 by approximately 27% \u00b1 0.37% and 18% \u00b1 0.42% at 24 h and 48 h of biofilm growth respectively (Fig. 3B) .

We constructed a S. aureus V329-P bap strain, harboring a transcriptional fusion between bap promoter and gfpmut2 expressed in plasmid pCN52. Western blot using anti-GFP specific antibodies revealed that the addition of MBIC of QC, MC and SC did not affect bap promoter expression (Fig. 4A) . Alternatively, polyphenols could inhibit biofilm development by reducing the amount of Bap anchored to the bacterial surface. Thus, we analyzed the levels of the Bap protein of the cell surface fraction of S. aureus V329 grown until exponential phase in the presence of MBICs of the polyphenols. Western immunoblotting using anti-Bap antibodies showed the same levels of Bap in all the samples (Fig. 4B ). Since polyphenols did not affect Bap expression, we hypothesized that they might inhibit biofilm formation by physically interfering with the capacity of Bap to form amyloid aggregates. To evaluate this hypothesis, we monitored Bap aggregation using native gel electrophoresis of S. aureus V329 cells in the presence of QC, MC and SC, grown until late stationary phase which is the growth stage where the Bap amyloid-like aggregates are formed 17 . Western immunoblotting showed the presence of several bands of high molecular weight (~ 1000 kDa) corresponding to Bap aggregates in the absence of polyphenols. The amount of aggregates was lower when bacteria were cultured in the presence of the polyphenols (Fig. 4C) . These data suggest that polyphenols affected the formation of Bap amyloid-like aggregates.",

Although the exact mechanism by which these polyphenols reduce Bap aggregation remains unknown it is likely that a direct interaction of polyphenols with different forms of the oligomers could impede the polymerization of the fibers. Our Th-T assay confirms that rBap_B aggregation kinetics follows a sigmoidal curve with a small lag phase that reflects a rapid nucleation-dependent growth and flavonoids disrupt this mechanism. These evidences demonstrate that QC, MC and SC likely bind monomeric Bap_B or early oligomers preventing its oligomerization into amyloid fibrils and thus, inhibiting S. aureus biofilm formation.",

            "text": "It is likely that the reason for the inhibitory process of Bap mediated biofilms between the different polyphenols is related to the polyphenolic structure. The aromatic rings of polyphenols may interact and compete with the prevalent aromatic residues (Phe and Trp) of the amyloids and block the self-assembly process and the fiber formation. Furthermore, the hydrophobic hydroxyl groups of polyphenols could bind to the hydrophobic residues of amyloid proteins and inhibit amyloidogenesis 54 . Thus, the selected flavonoids have 3 phenolic rings, at least 3 hydroxyl groups and in all cases 2 of them are vicinal, which are reported to have higher inhibitory effects on human amyloid proteins 34 . Interestingly, QC and MC are closely related in structure, with only one hydroxyl group of difference. The same occurs between SC and BC (Fig. S1 ). This may explain why these four polyphenols had the strongest inhibitory effect against S. aureus V329 biofilm. It is noteworthy that BC is able to inhibit both amyloid-like and PNAG-dependent biofilms. On the one hand, BC showed a significant reduction of an amyloid-like biofilm at sub-MIC concentrations of 20 \u03bcg/ml and 10 \u03bcg/ml ( 1/50x MIC and 1/100x MIC). On the other hand, it also reduced PNAG-dependent biofilm of S. aureus 15981 at a concentration of 20 \u03bcg/ml. Although we discarded this polyphenol from this study due to its broad action, the inhibitory effect of BC on the two types of biofilms make it a promising candidate polyphenol and it would be worth undertaking more detailed studies in the future.",

We also used the C-DAG system to expand the anti-amyloid effect of the polyphenols to the amyloid domains of Bap homologs from staphylococcal coagulase negative.

Bap of S. aureus belongs to the Biofilm Associated Protein (BAP) family. Homologous Bap proteins are present in many pathogenic bacteria.

Three replicates of each polyphenol and their respective controls were included in each experiment, which was repeated three times.
