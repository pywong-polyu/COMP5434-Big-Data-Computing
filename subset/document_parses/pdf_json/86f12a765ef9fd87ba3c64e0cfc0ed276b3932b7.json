Type 2 diabetes mellitus was induced by feeding sixty adult male albino rats with a high fructose diet accompanied by a single i.p. injection of streptozotocin (STZ). The rats were divided into 6 groups (10 rats/each) and the doses of nanoparticles were 10 mg/kg b.wt for ZnONPs, 1 mg/kg b.wt for Cr 2 O 3 , and 0.4 mg/kg b.wt for SeNPs. The results displayed that diabetes significantly decreased bodyweight, serum insulin, C-peptide, adiponectin levels, erythrocyte glutathione peroxidase, serum superoxide dismutase activities, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and total antioxidant capacity while causing a substantial increase in serum glucose, C-reactive protein, atherogenic index, HOMA-IR, malondialdehyde, lipid profile, interleukin-6 levels, and liver function and kidney function parameters. Furthermore, the findings showed a decrease in insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) hepatic mRNA expression level and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR-\u03b3) adipocyte mRNA expression level in type 2 diabetic rats. DNA damage was confirmed by performing the comet assay. Moreover, histological observation of pancreatic and hepatic tissues was performed, which were consistent with the biochemical results. The present study confirmed that oral administration of ZnONPs, Cr 2 O 3 NPs, SeNPs, and their mixture improved all the biochemical and genetic parameters toward normal levels and ameliorated the diabetic consequences that were manifested by restricting cellular DNA damage which maintaining pancreatic and hepatic tissues from oxidative damage. The best reported antidiabetic effect was observed in the mixture administered group.",

            "text": "Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a chronic progressive metabolic disorder and a multifactorial disease associated with many pathological alterations including microvascular and macrovascular complications that affect almost every part of the body (Othman et al. 2019) . Diabetes mellitus causes chronic disorders that affect the metabolism of carbohydrates, fats, proteins, and electrolytes in the body, leading to severe complications which are classified into acute, sub-acute, and chronic. Acute complications include hypoglycemia, diabetic ketoacidosis, hyperosmolar, and hyperglycaemic non-ketotic syndrome, while sub-acute complications include thirst, polyuria, lack of energy, visual blurriness, and weight loss (Wild et al. 2004 ). Based on the World Health Organization 2014, there are currently > 400 million people suffering from diabetes worldwide, and that number will reach to 552 million by 2030 (WHO.2014), 90% of those with diabetes have type 2 diabetes (T2DM). This type of diabetes is a complex and heterogeneous disorder that is distinguished by a progressive decline in insulin action or defect in insulin signal transduction (Jayawardena et al. 2012) . It is strongly correlated with obesity and insulin resistance and defects in pancreatic \u03b2-cell function and mass (Afifi et al.2020 ). However, it takes years to develop T2DM.Type 2 diabetes patients have also experienced obesity associated with decreased insulin sensitivity in parallel with an active \u03b2-cell compensatory system, such as extra basal insulin secretion and hyper-pro-insulinemia as part of their metabolic profile. For the induction of either type 1 or type 2 diabetes, STZ has been used alone or in combination with other chemicals or with dietary manipulations. Fructose intake in excess can induce moderate obesity and have several deleterious metabolic effects, including hypertriglyceridemia and hyperinsulinemia (Elankani et al. 2020) .",

            "text": "Many researches demonstrated the role of metals in glucose metabolism and the association of their deficiency with diabetes as vanadium (Thompson et al. 2009 ), chromium (Wang and Cefalu 2010) , and zinc (Chausmer 1998) has been reported to play a role in blood sugar maintenance and has been included in diabetes therapy. Zinc (Zn) is an essential micronutrient for pancreatic function through its effect on insulin stability and disturbance in Zn metabolism associated with diabetic complications; zinc promotes hepatic glycogenesis through its actions on the insulin pathways and thus improves glucose utilization (Jansen et al. 2009 ). Zinc has a role in insulin biosynthesis, storage, and secretion. There are several zinc transporters in pancreatic \u03b2-cells (Smidt et al. 2009 ), like zinc transporter 8 which has a potent role in insulin secretion (Rungby 2010) . In the medicine field, zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnONPs) have demonstrated great challenges. The antidiabetic activity of ZnONPs (as a novel agent to regulate diabetes mellitus in rats) was proven in a previous study (Abd El-Rahman et al. 2016 ). Umrani and Paknikar 2014 have reported significantly anti-diabetic effects of oral treatment of zinc oxide nanoparticles which have enhanced glucose tolerance. In diabetic rats, blood glucose levels were reduced, insulin levels and expression were increased, glucokinase (GK) activity was increased, and insulinreceptor substrates (IRS) and glucose transporter 2 (GLUT-2) expression levels were improved. Chromium is an essential nutrient required for optimal insulin activity as well as normal carbohydrate and lipid metabolism (Anderson 1998) . Accumulating evidence showed that tissue chromium levels of subjects with diabetes are lower than those of normal control subjects, and a correlation exists between low circulating levels of chromium and the incidence of type 2 diabetes (Anderson et al. 1991) . It has been proposed that chromium may increase the number of insulin receptor substrates, enhance receptor binding, and enhance intracellular signaling leading to the improvement of insulin resistance (Chen et al. 2009 ). Some studies have found that chromium supplementation significantly decreased the fasting blood glucose and decreased the HbA1c of diabetic individuals (Anderson 1998; Ghosh et al. 2002) . Chromium-deficient diets are associated with impaired glucose tolerance, hyperglycemia, and hyperinsulinemia (Abdourahman and Edwards 2008) . Chromium oxide nanoparticles (Cr 2 O 3 NPs) could improve the cellular antioxidant capacity, so, its supplementation is an effective treatment strategy to minimize increased oxidative stress in type 2 diabetic patients (Berenjian et al. 2018) . It is important to remember that one of the first and few studies examining the use of chromium oxide in the form of nanoparticles is our research. Selenium (Se) is an important element for health with important biological and biochemical functions due to its antioxidant properties (Chen et al. 2006) . Se is a basic component of selenoprotein which reduces oxidative stress (Ahmed et al. 2017) . The relation between selenium and T2DM is controversial (Wang et al. 2016) . Thus, untreated diabetes causes oxidative stress which leads to complications of the disease, and the antioxidant intake is considered being favorable for the therapy of diabetes (Mueller et al. 2009 ), Selenium plays a protective role against T2DM (Steinbrenner and Sies 2009) . Selenium nanoparticles (SeNPs) have gained considerable attention due to their biological activities and biocompatibility. As a food additive, SeNPs below 100 nanometers have a high functioning potential and antioxidant properties that are useful for human health. As antioxidants, selenium nanoparticles have less toxicity compared with selenium in their bulk form. SeNPs have been considered a promising instrument in drug therapies for type 2 diabetes; this is due to their high therapeutic properties and low toxicity (Srivastava et al. 2014) . The aim of the current research was to evaluate the impact of single or combined administration of nanoparticles of zinc oxide, chromium oxide, and selenium on genotoxicity and metabolic consequences in type 2 diabetic rat model.",

            "text": "The induction of insulin resistance (IR) through fructose feeding in animals has been employed previously. Fructose has been supplied ad libitum either in drinking water or with diets There was no significant difference between means have the same alphabetical superscripts in the same column, significant difference (p\u22640.05) There was no significant difference between means have the same alphabetical superscripts in the same column, significant difference (p\u22640.05) with a concentration of 10-15% for a short or longer period to induce IR or T2DM, respectively, in experimental animals. Unfortunately, the induction of IR, as well as T2DM only by fructose feeding, requires several weeks, which increases the cost of study. Additionally, it has been reported that only fructose feeding for a long period can lead to nutritional tolerance without developing classical signs and symptoms of IR and impaired glucose tolerance (Elankani et al. 2020) . Hence, the present study employed the combination of fructosefeeding for a shorter period and a lower dose of STZ injection for inducing all major pathogeneses of T2DM in rats. Current results demonstrated that T2DM caused significant hyperglycemia accompanied with increase in serum, HA1c %, and HOMA-IR and a significant decrease in serum insulin, c-peptide, and adiponectin levels. It can be argued that low Cpeptide is merely a marker of \u03b2-cell function and low levels indicate \u03b2-cell failure. Moreover, hypoadiponectinemia has been shown to precede a decrease in insulin sensitivity as well as predict progression from normoglycemia to prediabetes. The association of higher adiponectin levels with better glycemic control suggests that therapeutic modalities that increase adiponectin levels may be valuable targets for management of T2DM (Abdella and Mojiminiyi 2018). These previously mentioned investigations made us head to use elements as zinc, chromium, and selenium in their nano-form to ameliorate and cure these diabetic complications. On the other hand, the present study is the first study using the mixture of these nanoparticles in treatment of diabetic rats. We adopted that chemical and physical properties of nanoparticles such as size, shape, and surface charge determine their absorption and biodistribution. Absorption, cellular uptake, and clearance of nanoparticles may differ from their larger-sized counterparts. Several researchers have demonstrated enhanced bioavailability of nanoparticles compared with their poor water soluble salts (Nazarizadeh and Asri-Rezaie 2016; De et al. 2008) . Thus, the present study evaluated the possible therapeutic effect of single or combined administration of nanoparticles of zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnONPs), chromium oxide nanoparticles (Cr 2 O 3 NPs), and selenium nanoparticles (SeNPs), in fructose/streptozotocin diabetic rat model as a way of enhancing their bioavailability and thereby resulting in antidiabetic effects. Particle solubility, especially in the case of nanoparticles, plays an important role in bioavailability, and hence, the extent of their uptake in the stomach and intestine would be crucial. The uptake of the particulate fraction of nanoparticles from the intestine would then result in slow and continuous release of zinc ions, acting as a depot. Moreover, because of their ultra-small size, they can easily cross through biological membranes and therefore can be highly absorbed by the digestive system. Such characteristics have been eventuated in the utilization of nanoparticles via oral root (Nazarizadeh and Asri-Rezaie2016) . Present results showed a great reduction in blood glucose level in diabetic groups treated with mixture of nanoparticles, The microscopic examination of pancreatic cell for the experimental groups. Comparing with the normal histological structure of pancreatic tissues in (a) showed the normal islets of Langerhans and exocrine pancreatic acini in the healthy control group (G1). The rats fed high fructose diet plus an injection of STZ (G2) revealed severe changes described as marked vacuolation (3b-arrow (1)) and necrosis of cells of islets of Langerhans in (3b-arrow (2)) as well as vacuolation of epithelial lining pancreatic acini in (3B arrow (3)). While pancreatic tissues of diabetic rats that received ZnONPs (G3) showed in picture (c), Cr 2 O 3 NPs (G4) showed in picture (d), SeNPs (G5) showed in picture (e), and mixture of nanoparticles (G6) showed in picture (f) ZnONPs, Cr 2 O 3 NPs and SeNPs, respectively. This showed a great antidiabetic activity of those nanoparticles. However, ZnONPs induce more reduction than Cr 2 O 3 NPs and SeNPs, as zinc has been elucidated to be a potent metal that improves glucose utilization and metabolism through its potent influence on enhancement of hepatic glycogenesis through actions on the insulin signaling pathway (Nazarizadeh and Asri-Rezaie 2016) . Current experiments revealed that ZnONPs, Cr 2 O 3 NPs, and SeNPs could increase serum insulin level in diabetic groups treated with nanoparticles if compared with diabetic groups, but the best result appear in diabetic group treated with mixture. It appeared that ZnONPs also induced more insulin secretion if compared to the effect of Cr 2 O 3 NPs and SeNPs. There are few studies that have investigated the therapeutic effect of ZnONPs on insulin levels or secretion. However, others have demonstrated that zinc could enhance the glucose stimulated insulin secretion from rat isolated pancreatic islets (Richards-Williams et al. 2008) . Interestingly, ZnONPs did not possess the risk of hypoglycemia in living organisms so it can act as insulin secretagogues (Umrani and Paknikar 2014) . ZnONPs have several potential mechanisms may be the result of improved glucose tolerance. Firstly, treatment ZnONPs could lead to suppression of intestinal \u03b1-glucosidase enzyme and thereby decrease glucose absorption. Secondly, glucose uptake increased in liver and its subsequent storage (glycogenesis) might be lowered blood glucose levels. Thirdly, increased glycolysis by ZnONPs could lead to an increase in glucose disposal. Fig. 4 The histological examination of hepatic tissues for the experimental groups. The normal histological structure of hepatic parenchyma from normal central vein (a) and hepatocytes arranged in hepatic cords that shown in the healthy control group (G1). The high fructose diet plus injection of STZ; group (G2) revealed severe histopathological alterations confined as congestion of central vein in (B1-arrow 1), activation of Kupffer cells in (b1-arrow (2)), cytoplasmic vacuolization of hepatocytes (4-b2) comparing with the liver of diabetic rats that received ZnONPs (group 3) which revealed slight activation of Kupffer cells (c-arrow (1)) as well as slight congestion of central vein (carrow (2)). On the other hand, diabetic rats that received Cr 2 O 3 NPs, group (4) revealed slight activation of Kupffer cells (d). Moreover, liver of diabetic rats that received SeNPs group (5) revealed slight Kupffer cells activation in few examined sections (e). Meanwhile, the best treatment effect observed in group (6) diabetic rats that received mixture of nanoparticles (ZnONPs + Cr 2 O 3 NPs +SeNPs) showing no histopathological alterations (f) Also, the antidiabetic effects of ZnONPs may be referring to that zinc is directly involved in the overall metabolism of proteins, carbohydrates, and lipids. Zinc is a cofactor of the key enzymes in the case of glucose metabolism. It is a fructose 1-6 diphosphate aldolase activator and a fructose 1-6 diphosphatase inhibitor. Treatment with ZnONPs shows inhibitory effects on glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis, pathways that are active during the fasted state (Abd El-Rahman et al. 2016) . Zinc tends to have insulin-like effects by signaling insulin transduction. Additionally, Zn has a proliferative and protective effect on the pancreatic islets and plays an important role in insulin synthesis, storage, and secretion. Zn increased insulin mRNA and insulin receptors genes expression in hepatic tissues of ZnONPs-receiving diabetic rats. ZnONPs treatment may cause the regeneration of the pancreatic cells and thus increase the level of insulin secretion. These effects were further strengthened by our histological findings as ZnONPs regenerated the islets of Langerhans and mainly restored the normal \u03b2 cells (Avila et al. 2013) Similarly, Cr 2 O 3 NPs could also increase the insulin level by conjugate with the insulin receptor and induce phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrates (IRS-1 and IRS-2) which play a vital role in transmitting signals from insulin to intracellular metabolic pathways, including phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K). PI3K has a principal role in the function of insulin, through the activation of protein kinase B (PK-B). PI3K and PK-B have a vital role in the translocation of (GLUT4). Cr 2 O 3 NPs administration to diabetic rats increases the expression of insulin signaling cascade biomarkers in the liver through increasing IRS-1 and PI3K levels. Cr 2 O 3 NPs enhanced the tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptors in addition to enhancing the insulin receptor tyrosine kinase activity in the membranes fraction of the chromium-treated cells, as demonstrated by increased levels of IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation, chromium could upregulate insulinstimulated insulin signal transduction by influencing molecules downstream of the IR (El-Megharbel 2015). Administration of Cr 2 O 3 NPs to diabetic rats prevented the significant elevation in glycosylated hemoglobin, thereby increasing the level of total hemoglobin in diabetic rats (El-Megharbel 2015) . This could be due to the improved glycemic control produced by this new complex (mix of nanoparticles). On the other hand, SeNPs have various mechanisms in acting as hypoglycemic agent. Firstly, by reducing oxidative stress and reducing the oxidation of lipoproteins, SeNPs can play a key role in improving diabetes through their antioxidant activity. Secondly, the impacts of SeNPs on blood sugar regulation such as insulin signaling, glycolysis, and pyruvate metabolism. Thirdly, SeNPs enhance glucose uptake in fat cells taken from rats. This effect was caused by increased transport of glucose to the plasma membrane and serine/ threonine kinase activation. Fourthly, SeNPs can improve diabetes by participating in GPx1. GPx-1 plays an effective role in protecting pancreatic \u03b2-cells against damage that is caused by STZ. SeNPs exert their anti-diabetic effects by protecting the integrity of the \u03b2-cells, enhanced insulin secretion. So, the synergic effects of the three metals in mixture make it the best effector on insulin secretion and hypoglycemic effect.",

The increases in the activities of ALT and AST in the serum of diabetic rats may be mainly due to leakage of these enzymes from liver cytosol into the bloodstream as a consequence of hepatic injury-associated DM. Hepatic inflammation induced by diabetes mellitus pathogenesis is probably another reason for albumin level decrease in the blood (Rezaei-Kelishadi et al. 2017) . Insulin deficiency or insulin resistance may be responsible for dyslipidemia, because insulin has an inhibitory action on HMG-coA reductase, a key rate-limiting enzyme responsible for the metabolism of cholesterol-rich LDL particles (Hussein et al .2014) .",

The results of the present study indicated that SeNPs are of beneficial effects on liver functions and restored the activities of ALT and AST toward normal levels as well as the level of albumin. These finding could be explained due to the radical scavenging property of Se and the importance of Se in protecting the integrity and the functions of tissues (Majeed et al. 2018) . These results could be due to the role of SeNPs in protecting the integrity and functions of liver tissues besides its radical scavenging activity. The observed renal dysfunction in HFD/STZ rats was reversed by treatment with SeNPs. The hypoglycemic effect of SeNPs may explain the ameliorated renal function in the treated rats. Treatment with SeNPs leads to the recovery and restoration of endothelial dysfunction and vascular disorders through regulating antioxidant enzymes and releasing nitric oxide.",

            "text": "It is well known that diabetic hyperglycemia has a major role in the induction of oxidative stress. Data generated in the present investigation demonstrated augmentation of oxidative stress in diabetic rats with concomitant impairment in the antioxidant defense systems, as observed by a marked elevation in the oxidative stress biomarker (MDA and NO) and reduction in the free-radical neutralizing antioxidants, including SOD, GPx, and TAC. Meanwhile, administration of ZnONPs, Cr 2 O 3 NPs, and SeNPs significantly elevated the GPx and SOD activities and significantly reduced MDA and Histopathological lesions were scored through determination of the percentage of the lesions in five randomly examined high power (\u00d7400) microscopic fields per animal using the following score system (0-4); score 0=absence of the lesions in all rats of the group, score1= mild (<25%); 2 = moderate (26-50%); 3 = moderate to severe (51-75%); and 4 = marked severe (76-100%) NO levels in diabetic rats. Surprisingly, mixture-treated group showed normalization of GSH and SOD activities as well as NO and MDA levels as compared to control group. Moreover, mixture administered group have a significant increase in TAC than other treated groups. On the other hand, SeNPs treated group has more effective antioxidant activity than ZnONPs and Cr 2 O 3 NPs treated groups. This refers to the role of SeNPs in recovery and restoration of endothelial dysfunction and vascular disorders through regulating antioxidant enzymes and releasing nitric oxide (Ozt\u00fcrk et al. 2015) . One of the most approved hypotheses of Se antioxidant activity is the potential of SeNPs to keep the glutathione in the reduced form where glutathione has the ability to detoxify the ROS. The activity of SeNPs is achieved by the selenium-containing enzyme GPx which protects cells against ROS (Usrey et al. 2020) . Ukperoro et al. 2010 reported that Zn may either increase the biosynthesis of GSH or reduce the oxidative stress contributing to less degradation of GSH or have both effects. This provided a potential mechanism that Zn deficiency increase progress of DM. This provides a potential mechanism for Zn deficiency to improve DM development. In addition, Cr 2 O 3 NPs greatly scavenged free radical molecules and thus decreased MDA level as it is the final product of lipid peroxidation and increased the enzymatic capacities of SOD and GPx and thus increasing TAC level, improving liver function tests, and thus enhancing the conversion of blood glucose into glycogen and thus decreasing level of blood glucose which reflects the solution for diabetes mellitus complications (El-Megharbel 2015) . Supplementation of Cr 2 O 3 NPs to diabetic rats significantly modulated the alterations in oxidative stress marker (NO) and antioxidant biomarkers levels in serum. Cr 2 O 3 NPs administration inhibits NO production and iNOS protein expressions. Also, Cr can attenuate diabetic oxidative stress and improve antioxidant capacity in cell culture and experimental animals (Hua et al. 2012) . The modulating effect of Cr 2 O 3 NPs on antioxidant biomarkers and oxidative stress and may be related to its glucoregulatory effect as documented in the current study. Insulin deficiency or insulin resistance occurred in T2DM may be responsible for dyslipidemia, because insulin has an inhibitory action on HMG-coA reductase, a key rate-limiting enzyme responsible for the metabolism of cholesterol-rich LDL particles (Hussein et al. 2014) . The results showed the hypolipidemic effects of ZnONPs, Cr 2 O 3 NPs, and SeNPs treated groups in approximately equal manner. Mixture-treated group showed the best hypolipidemic effect that approximately normalizes lipid profile levels well as atherogenic coefficient and risk. The beneficial effect of ZnONPs on lipid profile levels suggests possible insulinmimetic effects in adipocytes. It has recently been reported that zinc ions inhibit adipocyte lipolysis and non-esterified fatty acids release through inhibition of hormone-sensitive lipase. Similar insulin mimetic mechanisms may be operative in the case of ZnONPs (Umrani and Paknikar 2014) .",

After the oral administration of SeNPs, a remarkable decrease in serum levels of TAGs, TC, and LDL-C was observed linked with a significant increase in HDL-c levels compared to the untreated diabetic rats.

Hyperglycemia induces IL-6 production from endothelium and macrophages, which might worsen insulin liberation and signaling cascades. Elevated levels of IL-6 promote insulin resistance in skeletal muscle and endothelial dysfunction, as well as liberation of CRP from the liver (Ukperoro et al. 2010) . The current study revealed that oral administration of ZnONPs Cr 2 O 3 NPs, SeNPs, and their mixture to diabetic rats showed a significant reduction in inflammatory markers as compared to the control group. The best anti-inflammatory effect was reported in mixture group that success in normalize the levels of IL-6 and CRP in diabetic rats. ZnONPs negatively regulated gene expression of inflammatory cytokines such IL-1 and IL-6, which are known to generate ROS. ZnONPs have also been proposed to interact with cell membranes to stabilize them against oxidative damages Ukperoro et al. 2010 . Meanwhile, Cr 2 O 3 NPs inhibit the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines (i.e., IL-6) and reduce oxidative stress in monocytes exposed to high glucose and standard oxidants like H 2 O 2 . Furthermore, chromium nanoparticles were able to mitigate diabetic abnormalities through decreasing serum glucose, and IL-6 and increasing adiponectin level (Abou Zaid et al. 2015) . Several studies have shown that SeNPs downregulate mRNA expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines including inducible NO synthase (iNOS), interleukin IL-1, and TNF-\u03b1 thus reducing inflammation (Shi et al. 2011; Wang et al. 2016) . Selenium is known as a fundamental component of selenoprotein, an essential enzyme in the body that protects against oxidative stress and inflammation (Majeed et al. 2018) .",

These results go in hand with those reported by Rotter et al. 2002 who demonstrated that adipocytes secrete various proteins, called adipocytokines, which influence insulin sensitivity profoundly thereby providing possible molecular link between increased adiposity and reduced PPAR-\u03b3. IRS-1 appears to play a central role in the insulin-stimulated signal transduction pathway and links the insulin receptor to its final biological actions via a series of intermediate effectors (Afifi et al. 2020 ). In the present study, decreases of IRS-1 expression in the liver were observed in diabetic rats as in other study reported by Sahin et al. 2013 . Our results pointed out that mRNA expression levels of PPAR-\u03b3 and IRS-1 gene appeared to increase in ZnONPs, Cr 2 O 3 NPs, and SeNPs treated groups if compared with the diabetic untreated group, and the best result found in mixture treated group. The present study clearly showed that supplementing Cr 2 O 3 NPs or SeNPs exert antioxidant; antihyperlipidemic, anti-inflammatory, and anti-hyperglycaemic effects, and increases the level of insulin in diabetic rats. These changes may be related to the elevation of the levels of PPAR-\u03b3 and IRS-1 in the liver, kidney, and muscle tissues.",

This result is similar to that obtained from the study of Sardas et al. 2001 .The current data revealed that the best protective effect was observed in mix-treated group followed by SeNPs, Cr 2 O 3 NPs, and ZnONPs treated groups, respectively. The possible causes for selenium to have more protective effect on DNA rather than other NPs may be due to the antioxidant property of a compound which could play a significant role in decreasing the nuclear injury caused by diabetes. SeNPs have antidiabetic potency, repression of oxidative stress, potentiating of the antioxidant defense system, and inhibition of pancreatic inflammation. So, selenium plays a protective role against type 2 diabetes. The protective roles of selenium in mammalian cell are due to its function in the active site of many antioxidant enzymes, such as thioredoxin reductase, and glutathione. Dietary selenium may cause an increase in glutathione peroxidase, which has the ability to detoxify ROS that can interfere with insulin signaling and result in regulation of glucose levels and prevention of diabetes (Abd El-Rahim et al. 2017). The measurement of the plasma levels of these nanomaterials in rats under these experimental conditions and COVID-19 pandemic were the limitations of this study.",

They also showed good hypolipidemic, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory properties as well as DNA protecting activity and genotoxicity ameliorative effects. The strongest ameliorative and antidiabetic effects have been shown by the mixture of these nanoparticles, which can be due to the synergistic impact of many mechanisms of each compound that may have a different mechanism of action. For the assessment of therapeutic efficacy, the mechanism of action of the observed anti-diabetic effect of the mixture is warranted and is considered a healthy supplementary therapy for T2DM. It can also help to reduce diabetic complications and can act as a good alternative to antidiabetic drugs. Overall, the current work indicates that a mixture of ZnONPs, Cr 2 O 3 NPs, and SeNPs represents a new formulation for achieving an antidiabetic activity.",
