Here we showed that early administration of monoclonal antibodies in patients with Primary Antibody Defects and COVID-19 reduced the time of viral replication and avoid disease evolution. A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t Abstract Previous reports highlighted the efficacy of SARS-CoV-2 specific monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against COVID-19. Here we conducted a prospective study on clinical outcome and antiviral effect of mAbs added to standard of care therapy in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients with Primary Antibody Defects. Median time of SARS-CoV-2 qPCR positivity was shorter in eight patients treated with mAbs (22 days) than in ten patients treated with standard of care therapy only (37 days, p=0.026). Median time of SARS-CoV-2 qPCR positivity from mAbs administration was 10 days. SARS-CoV-2 mAbs treatment was effective and well-tolerated in patients with Primary Antibody Defects.",

Patients with Common Variable Immunodeficiencies (CVID) are the predominant group, showing younger age at death (3) and different risk factors predisposing to severe course in comparison to the general population (4) . CVID is the most frequent symptomatic PAD in adults and children, with a wide spectrum of clinical complications including recurrent infection, and autoimmune or inflammatory manifestations. Surveys reported a severe clinical course in some CVID patients having more severe defects in antibody responses, dysfunctional B cells, and immune dysregulation. In these patients, the defective B and T cell cellular immune responses might account for an increased risk for prolonged infections, leading to the possible emergence of dangerous vaccine-evasion mutants (5, 6) .",

Recently, we have showed that two third of PAD patients are unable to produce specific antibodies after two doses of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine and, instead of generating classical specific memory B cells, they developed atypical memory B cells, short lived plasma blasts, and variable T cell response (7) . Atypical memory B cells are mostly generated during extrafollicular reactions without the involvement of antigen selection in the germinal center reaction (8) and are considered short-lived activated memory B cells. In patients unable to mount an adequate antibody response, A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t additional strategies for protection are needed. So far, prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection could not be achieved by immunoglobulin replacement treatment, due to the lack of specific antibodies in the current lots of gamma globulins (9) . One still controversial option is the possibility to substitute the defective antibody production by convalescent plasma. The administration of convalescent plasma <72 hours after the onset of symptoms has been shown to reduce disease progression in immunocompetent patients with mild disease and at high risk for disease progression only (10) . Moreover, the low neutralizing potency of convalescent plasma therapy is difficult to be standardized. In addition, plasma and transfusion usage in patients lacking immunoglobulins and in particular, in patients without serum IgA, should be limited in that it might cause adverse reactions (11) .",

Symptomatic patients were considered as positive for SARS-CoV-2 by qPCR on nasopharyngeal swabs obtained within one day after onset of symptoms. Asymptomatic patients were identified by the screening of patients attending the hospital or in case of family contact. The duration of viral positivity was calculated as the interval between the first positive and the first negative nasopharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2. Participants were grouped on the basis of the treatment with mAbs in two groups: standard of care treatment (Group 1) and standard of care treatment plus mAbs (Group 2). During the study time, patients were allowed to continue their therapies, including immunoglobulins replacement for the underlying antibody deficiency, and were monitored for their clinical status. During SARS-CoV-2 infection, patients were followed by qRT PCR every 7-10 days until a confirmed negative swab. The study was approved by the Ethical Committee of the Sapienza University of Rome (Prot. 0521/2020, July 13, 2020). The study was performed in accordance with the Good Clinical Practice guidelines, the International Conference on Harmonization guidelines, and the most recent version of the Declaration of Helsinki.",

Baseline characteristics of patients treated with COVID-19 standard of care and patients treated with standard of care plus mAbs were compared with \u03c7 2 test for categorical variables and Mann-Whitney for continuous variables. Differences were deemed significant when P < 0.05. Statistical Package for Social Sciences version 15 (SPSS Inc., 233 South Wacker Drive, 11th Floor, Chicago) has been used for the analysis. Results. From March 2020 to May 2021, a total of 18 PAD patients, 7 females and 11 males, aged 51.5 years (range 26-71) were tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by qPCR from nasopharyngeal swabs. Four patients were asymptomatic. Fourteen patients were symptomatic: 6/14 patients required hospitalization due to progression of COVID-19 symptoms. The most common COVID-19 symptoms recorded were fever (72%), cough (61%), and dyspnea (39%). Chest CT scan showed pneumonia in 5 patients (28%). Demographic and clinical data of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients is provided in Table 1. Ten patients received the standard of care for COVID-19 (Group 1): one patient (n. 9) received Dexamethasone; one patient (n. 10) Dexamethasone and Remdesivir, two patients (n. 1 and 5) were treated with Tocilizumab, Dexamethasone and Lopinavir/Ritonavir; six patients did not require treatment (n. 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8). Eight PAD patients received the standard of care for COVID-19 plus monoclonal antibodies-based therapy (Group 2): two patients (n. 11 and 12) were treated with Bamlanivimab only; 6 patients (n. 13, 15, 18) received a double therapy with Bamlanivimab/Etesevimab and patient n. 16 Bamlanivimab/Etesevimab plus Dexamethasone; patient 14 received double therapy with Calsirimab/Imdevimab plus",
