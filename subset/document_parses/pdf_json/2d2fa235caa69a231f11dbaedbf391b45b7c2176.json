Prehospital regionalization efforts included onsite auditing by the MoHW and the categorization of hospital-based ED using a three-tiered approach to emergency care (severe, moderate, and general).

            "text": "The unintended consequence of hospital emergency care quality disclosure is that the hospital ED becomes the first choice for people seeking treatment for timesensitive emergency conditions or convenience. The Taiwan MoHW proposed a co-payment of $12 for an ED visit to possibly reduce primary care-treatable ED visits. However, the National Health Insurance medical service payment standards dictate that the co-payments for a medical center ED, regional hospital ED, and local hospital ED visit are $15, $10, and $5, respectively. In comparison, the co-payment for an outpatient clinic visit at a medical center is $12; at a regional hospital, $8; at a local hospital, $2.7; and at a general practitioner office, $1.7. Other factors that must be considered are traffic and waiting time costs in the primary care setting, as well as a minimum wage of $4.50 per hour [64] . Meanwhile, a nationwide emergency policy requires the hospital emergency care system to improve its abilities to meet patients' needs by improving accessibility through increased convenience (e.g., providing immediate access to an ED anytime) and availability (e.g., providing consultations with an available specialist within 30 min). Therefore, a hospital ED offers more significant time savings and cost-effectiveness for patients. A systematic review reported that financial constraints and case management are two effective approaches to increase ED use appropriateness [65] . Raven et al. [65] suggested that financial measures may decrease ED visits without increasing appropriateness; conversely, case management may decrease ED visits while increasing appropriateness. We examined the effects of providerrelated policy and disclosure of related information on improving patients' appropriate ED use and found that this policy goal was unmet. We agree with Smulowitz's suggestion [66] to reshape emergency care and extend medical emergency services to meet patients' needs, such as offering real-time \"face-to-face\" telehealth to provide medical recommendations to support patient decisionmaking, and relieve patient anxiety, implementing an access policy that combines primary and ED care data without time or location limitations [67, 68] .",
