Recent studies suggest that the population prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, a proxy for the number of asymptomatic cases, could be an order of magnitude larger than expected from the number of reported symptomatic cases. Knowing the precise prevalence and contagiousness of asymptomatic transmission is critical to estimate the overall dimension and pandemic potential of COVID-19. However, at this stage, the effect of the asymptomatic population, its size, and its outbreak dynamics remain largely unknown. Here we use reported symptomatic case data in conjunction with antibody seroprevalence studies, a mathematical epidemiology model, and a Bayesian framework to infer the epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19. Our model learns, in real time, the time-varying contact rate of the outbreak, and projects the temporal evolution and credible intervals of the effective reproduction number and the symptomatic, asymptomatic, and recovered popu-1 .

Here, to explicitly account for the asymptomatic population, we introduce an SEIIR model, which further divides the infectious population into symptomatic and asymptomatic groups.

While it is tempting-and easily possible-to introduce many more sub-populations into the model, for example a pre-symptomatic, hospitalized, or mortality group 36 , here, we focus on the simplest possible model that allows us to explore the role of the asymptomatic population throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. To systematically probe different scenarios, we combine this deterministic SEIIR model with a dynamic effective reproduction number and adopt machine learning and uncertainty quantification techniques to learn the reproduction number, in real time, and quantify uncertainties in the symptomatic-to-asymptomatic ratio, and the initial exposed and infectious populations 29 .

Classical SEIR epidemiology models with static parameters are well suited to model outbreak dynamics under unconstrained conditions and predict how the susceptible, exposed, infectious, and recovered populations converge freely toward the endemic equilibrium 20 . However, they cannot capture changes in disease dynamics and fail to converge towards a temporary equilibrium before the entire population has become sufficiently immune to prevent further spreading 36 . To address this limitation, we introduce a time-dependent contact rate \u03b2(t), which we learn dynamically from the reported case data. Figure 1 demonstrates that our approach can successfully identify a dynamic contact rate that not only decreases monotonically, but is also capable of reproducing local contact fluctuations. With this dynamic contact rate, our model can capture the characteristic S-shaped COVID-19 case curve that plateaus before a large fraction of the population has been affected by the disease, resembling a Gompertz function. Previous studies have inferred discrete date points at which the contact rates vary 6 or used sliding windows over the amount of novel reported infections 34 to motivate dynamic contact rates. As such, our framework provides a model-based method for statistical inference of virus transmissibility: It naturally learns the most probable contact rate from the changing time evolution of new confirmed cases and concomitantly quantifies the uncertainty on that estimation.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 611, "end": 613, "text": "36", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 1319, "end": 1321, "text": "34", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 749, "end": 757, "text": "Figure 1", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}], "section": "(which was not certified by peer review)"}, {"text": "number.

Throughout the past months, an increasing number of researchers around the globe have started to characterize the size of the asymptomatic population to better understand the outbreak dynamics of COVID-19 22 . Two major challenges drive the interest in these studies: estimating the severity of the outbreak, e.g., hospitalization and mortality rates 12 , and predicting the success of surveillance and control efforts, e.g., contact tracing or vaccination 14 . This is especially challenging now-in almost complete lockdown-when the differences in transmission dynamics between the symptomatic and asymptomatic populations are small and difficult to quantify. However, as Figure 2 suggests, these transmission dynamics can have a significant effect on the size of the asymptomatic population: For infectious periods of C a = 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 C s , the maximum infectious population varies from 0.53% to 0.95% and 1.69%. Interestingly, not only the sum of the infectious and recovered populations, but also the uncertainty of their prediction, remain relatively insensitive to variations in the infectious period. To explore whether this is a universal trend, we perform the same analysis for three different locations, Santa Clara County 3 , New York City 5 , and Heinsberg 46 Of the three locations we analyzed here, Santa Clara County tested IgG and IgM, New York City tested IgG, and Heinsberg tested IgG and IgA.

Nevertheless, it has a few limitations, some of them by design, some simply limited by the current availability of data: First, our current SEIIR model assumes a similar contact rate \u03b2(t) for symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals. While we can easily adjust this in the model by defining individual symptomatic and asymptomatic rates \u03b2 s (t) and \u03b2 a (t), we currently do not have data about the temporal evolution of the hidden asymptomatic infectious population I a (t) and longitudinal large population antibody studies would be needed to appropriately calibrate \u03b2 a (t).

Third, and this is not only true for our specific model, but for COVID-19 forecasts in general, all predictions can be sensitive to the amount of testing in time. As such, they crucially rely on testing policies and testing capacities. We expect to see a significant increase in the symptomatic-to-asymptomatic, or rather detected-to-undetected, ratio as we move towards systematically testing larger fractions of the population and more and more people who have no symptoms at all. The intensity of testing increased significantly in all locations during our simulation period. For example, in Santa Clara County, testing was extremely limited until early April, increased substantially in the first three weeks of April, and even more after. Including limited testing and more undocumented cases during the early outbreak would shift the case distribution towards earlier days, result in lower C a values, and predict an even earlier outbreak date. Fourth, while we have included uncertainty in the seroprevalence data, the three locations we analyzed here tested different types of antibodies and had different sampling procedures. Seroprevalence could have been higher if all three locations had tested for the same three antibodies and data may differ depending on biases introduced by the sampling procedure. Finally, our current model does not explicitly account for innate and cellular immunity. If the fraction of the population with innate and cellular immunity is substantially high, we would anticipate a smaller susceptible population and a larger and earlier protective immunity overall.

Both critically rely on a rapid identification of infections, typically through clinical symptoms. Recent antibody prevalence studies could explain why these strategies have largely failed in containing the COVID-19 pandemic: Increasing evidence suggests that the number of unreported asymptomatic cases could outnumber the reported symptomatic cases by an order of magnitude or more.
