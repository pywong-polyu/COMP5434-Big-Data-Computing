However, the comparison of clinical characteristics between patients \u2265 70 and those < 70 has not been implemented yet. To achieve that, we collected clinical data of consecutive 222 patients in Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University diagnosed between January 13, 2020 and February 4, 2020. We divided them into an under-70 group and an over-70 group according to their ages, comparing their clinical characteristics. Meanwhile, univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were performed to identify the prognostic factors. Among the patients enrolled, 37 (16.67%) were 70 or older and 185 (83.33%) were younger than 70. Higher proportions of dyspnoea, expectoration, chronic cardiovascular disease, diabetes, organ complications, severe-to-critical cases, a higher death rate, a longer hospital stay and decreased immune status were observed in the over-70 group patients compared with their younger counterparts. The risk factors for death included dyspnoea, muscle ache, elevated myocardial enzymes, elevated C3 in over-70 patients and dyspnoea, pharyngalgia, chronic cardiac disease, increased C-reactive protein, IgA, decreased platelets in under-70 patients. Overall, our research compared the clinical characteristics of the two populations with different immune status and illustrated differentiated risk factors for death in them.",

Shortly after that, a previously unknown betacoronavirus was discovered through unbiased sequencing in samples from patients with such pneumonia [2] . The novel \u03b2-coronavirus was named SARS-CoV-2 by International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) and WHO had officially named this new disease as corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) [3] . Since then, the COVID-19-confirmed cases increased rapidly. As of August 28, 2020, a total of 24257989 confirmed cases and 827246 related deaths have been reported worldwide [4] . Moreover, COVID-19 cases have been reported in more than 200 countries, areas or territories. On January 30, 2020, WHO announced that the event constituted a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC), indicating that a big threat to global health has been posed by the novel coronavirus infections [5] .",

            "text": "The novel coronavirus, namely SARS-CoV-2, belongs to the betacoronavirus family, as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV do. However, SARS-CoV-2 is relatively unique. It is less deadly but has a relatively covert AGING characteristic compared to the other two coronaviruses [3] . SARS-CoV-2 could be transmitted from person to person and the basic reproductive number (R0) of it is estimated to be 1.4-3.9, which is higher than that of MERS-CoV (0.50-0.92) and nearly the same as SARS-CoV (2.3-3.7) [3, 6] . Moreover, unlike SARS-CoV, asymptomatic patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 could be a source of transmission, which jeopardizes the screening of infected people by temperature measurements or by overt signs and symptoms [3] . There is now no special treatment or vaccine for this disease and the only treatment is supportive, which might be a contribution to the high death rate in the elderly patients. The overall death rate of COVID-19 is 2.3% but elderly patients are more likely to be seriously ill [7] . The fatality rates of patients over 60 are higher than the average, and the deaths of them accounts for over 50% of the total deaths nationwide in China [8, 9] . Furthermore, the immune status of healthy people \u2265 70 is different from those < 70 [10] . Thus, the clinical courses and risk factors of patients aged 70 or above and those under 70 are likely to differ considerably. In this study, we investigated the different clinical characteristics between patients \u2265 70 and those < 70. The study aims to provide useful information for exploring differentiated prognostic factors in COVID-19 patients.",

Patients also had underlying diseases such as chronic heart disease, chronic pulmonary disease, chronic liver disease and chronic kidney disease. Among them, chronic heart disease and chronic pulmonary disease are the most common comorbidities. In the research by Guan et al., the prevalences of coronary heart disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) were 2.5% and 1.1%, respectively [9] . Meanwhile, the prevalences of cardiovascular disease and COPD by Wang et al. were 14.5% and 2.9% [11] . In comparison, the prevalences are high in ours, numbering 19.82% and 8.56%, respectively. This might contribute to a large proportion of severe-to-critical patients and a high death rate in our study. The prevalences of other comorbidities in these studies are similar and might contribute less to disease severity and fatality. An important complication of COVID-19 is acute myocardial injury (AMI), which is reflected specifically by troponin I and creatine kinase- [12] . However, due to the lack of specific biomarkers in our study, the incidence of AMI was not available. In addition, the incidence rate of ARDS was also higher in the over-70 group patients compared to the under-70 ones, which might be correlated with a higher occurrence rate of dyspnoea in that group. Significant differences were also observed in the incidence of complications such as ALD, AKI, and bacterial infection. The occurrence rates of them were higher in patients in the over-70 group. Similarly, the occurrence rates of ARDS, ALD and AKI are all higher than those reported by Guan et al. [9] . This might be correlated with higher prevalences of chronic pulmonary disease, chronic kidney disease and chronic liver disease in our study. It may also contribute to high proportions of severe-to-critical COVID-19 patients in our research, especially for those in the over-70 group.",

The differences might be explained by a high percent of severe-tocritical patients in our research (55.85%) compared to that in the whole population (18.5%) or to the percent of patients admitted to ICU in the study of Chen et al. (23%). In the study by Guan et al. including 1099 patients [9] , the total death rate was 1.4% and the death rate of severe cases was 8.1%. The low death rate in their study may also be attributed to a much lower proportion of severe cases (15.7%) compared to ours. The data of most of the patients in the above-mentioned studies was collected in January. Thus, the characteristics of these patients were comparable. The above differences might be partially accounted for by the different classification standards in these studies. However, the alterations in classification standards doesn't seem decisive in explaining these differences. The high death rate of the patients and high proportion of severe-to-critical patients in our study might be better explained by the fact that Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University was a designated hospital for severe COVID-19 patients.",

This is consistent with the results of our previous research that indicated the lower levels of CD3 + T cell, CD4 + T cell, CD8 + T cell, B cell (CD19 + ) and NK cell (CD16 + 56 + ) in severe COVID-19 cases and their correlations with the course of those cases [14] . Consistently, lymphocyte count was also lower in the over-70 group than in the under-70 group. In previous research, lymphocyte count was reduced in patients admitted to ICU compared to non-ICU patients [11, 12] . It could be partly explained by the fact that lymphocytes could be killed by coronaviruses due to the damage of the cytoplasmic components or the activation of apoptosis [15, 16] . Lymphocyte counts are also indicators of the immune system. In a previous study investigating reference values for T lymphocytes in healthy people, the numbers of CD4 + and CD8 + lymphocytes differed significantly between people aged 70 or older and those younger participants [10] .",

This is reflected by a higher death rate and a lower cumulative survival rate in the over-70 group in our study. In addition to age, there were several risk factors for death, as revealed by Cox regression analyses in the present study. In the over-70 COVID-19 patients, the factors included dyspnoea, muscle ache, elevated myocardial enzymes and increased C3. In the under-70 patients, the factors involved chronic cardiac disease, dyspnoea and increased IgA. Among the factors mentioned above, myocardial comorbidity is a predictor of death, as was reported in previous research [8, 17] . This might be attributed to the distribution of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the key host cellular receptor of SARS-CoV-2, in cardiac cells. Previous research has shown that patients with underlying heart disease exhibited an increased ACE2 expression; if these people were infected by the virus, they might be exposed to a high risk of heart attack and a critically ill condition [19] . Besides, respiratory comorbidities and complications were also reported to be risk factors in previous research [8, 18] . Dyspnoea was probably a manifestation for impaired lung function and might be related to ARDS [8] . These respiratory manifestations may lead to respiratory failure and fatality. An increased C3 level might be a sign of an activated complement system, which regulates a systemic inflammatory response and contributes to the pathologic outcomes of coronavirus infection [20] . Increased IgA may be a sign of massive virus infection since SARS-CoV-2 behaves like other respiratory viruses and yield the production of protective secretory IgA in infected individuals [21] . Thus, these indexes reflected the death risks in the two age groups of COVID-19 patients with different immune status.",

Secondly, the number of the elderly patients included in this study was lower than that of the younger patients, which might lead to some random errors.

The percentage of severe cases among the aged group patients was also higher, correlating with a higher death rate among them. The risk factors for death included dyspnoea, muscle ache, elevated myocardial enzymes, elevated C3 in over-70 patients and dyspnoea, pharyngalgia, chronic cardiac disease, increased CRP, IgA, decreased platelets in under-70 patients. Our research compared the clinical characteristics of the two populations with different immune status and provided differentiated risk factors for death in them.",

The last day of follow-up was February 27, when the follow-up time of all survival patients reached 28 days. The primary end point was survival and death until February 27, 2020 and the living status of those patients was confirmed at that time. The clinical data involved information such as age, gender, comorbidities, symptoms, treatment, laboratory results, hospital stay, clinical outcomes, spectrum of underlying diseases and complications.
