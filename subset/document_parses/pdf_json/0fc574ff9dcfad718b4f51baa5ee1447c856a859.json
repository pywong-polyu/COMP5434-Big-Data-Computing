To perform gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) and analysis of immune cell infiltration on non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) expression profiling microarray data based on bioinformatics, construct TICS scoring model to distinguish prognosis time, screen key genes and cancer-related pathways for NSCLC treatment, explore differential genes in NSCLC patients, predict potential therapeutic targets for NSCLC, and provide new directions for the treatment of NSCLC. Methods. Transcriptome data of 81 NSCLC patients and the GEO database were used to download matching clinical data (access number: GSE120622). Form the expression of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). TICS values were calculated and grouped according to TICS values, and we used mRNA expression profile data to perform GSEA in non-small-cell lung cancer patients. Biological process (GO) analysis and DAVID and KOBAS were used to undertake pathway enrichment (KEGG) analysis of differential genes. Use protein interaction (PPI) to analyze the database STRING, and construct a PPI network model of target interaction. Results. We obtained 6 significantly related immune cells including activated B cells through the above analysis (Figure 1(b) , p < 0.001). Based on the TICS values of significantly correlated immune cells, 41 high-risk and 40 low-risk samples were obtained. TICS values and immune score values were subjected to Pearson correlation coefficient calculation, and TICS and IMS values were found to be significantly correlated (Cor \ufffd 0.7952). Based on non-small-cell lung cancer mRNA expression profile data, a substantial change in mRNA was found between both the high TICS group as well as the low TICS group (FDR 0.01, FC > 2). e researchers discovered 730 mRNAs that were considerably upregulated in the high TICS group and 121 mRNAs that were considerably downregulated in the low TICS group. High confidence edges (combined score >0.7) were selected using STRING data; then, 191 mRNAs were matched to the reciprocal edges; finally, an undirected network including 164 points and 777 edges was constructed. Important members of cellular chemokine-mediated signaling pathways, such as CCL19, affect patient survival time. Conclusion. (1) e longevity of patients with non-small-cell lung cancer was substantially connected with the presence of immature B cells, activated B cells, MDSC, effector memory CD4 T cells, eosinophils, and regulatory T cells.",

Small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) accounts for around 85% of all lung cancer cases [2] .

Immune tolerance occurs, leading to immune escape of tumor cells [4] , and in the process of killing tumor cells, the most central role in TME is played by CD8+ T cells [5] , the quality and quantity of which are critical for immunotherapeutic efficacy [6] . Studies of PD-1 inhibitors for melanoma [7] have found that the number of CD8+ T cells correlates with efficacy. Tumor-infiltrating B cells are an important part of the immune system's microenvironment. In NSCLC patients, CD4+ T lymphocytes can be seen in tumor cells infiltrated by B cells and tumor cells with tertiary lymphoid structure. And high density of follicular B cells is associated with a better prognosis in NSCLC patients [8] . Bruno et al. [9] found that tumor-infiltrating B cells can present endogenous tumor antigens to CD4+ TIL and alter them in vitro.

Chemokines can be classified into four groups according to the number and location of N-terminal cysteine residues: C, CC, CXC, and CX3C. For example, CCL2 chemokine has the ability to chemoattract monocytes, macrophages, and T lymphocytes [14] . It has been shown that anti-CCL2 antibodies blocking the effects of CCL2 such as reducing MDSC, increasing CD4+ and CD8+ T cell infiltration, and promoting IFNy secretion can enhance the tumor immune effect of PD-1 in treating lung cancer in mice [15] . CX3CL1 (FKN, fractalkine) is the only member of the CX3C type chemokine family, which possesses chemotactic functions common to chemokines and mediates the wandering and activation of leukocytes, especially lymphocytes and phagocytes. Li et al. [16] used gene silencing technology to confirm the stable high expression of CX3CL1 in the hepatocellular carcinoma cell line HepG2, which inhibited tumor angiogenesis. In breast cancer studies, CX3CL1 was found to have a possible role in tumor metastasis [17, 18] , and high CX3CL1 expression correlates with good prognosis in breast cancer [19] and can also be used as one of the indications for immunomodulatory therapy.",

At the same time, we explored whether the four subnetworks can effectively distinguish high TICS from low TICS. We find that the four small networks can distinguish high TICS from low TICS by drawing the ROC curve and calculating the area under the curve, indicating that they are potential markers to distinguish TICS (Figure 4(f ) ). Among them, CCL19 which is as an important member of chemokine-mediated signaling pathway has demonstrated that its expression level in tumor FSC is related to the degree of immune cell infiltration of CD8 + T cells and tumor accumulation (29391257). In conclusion, the level of CCL19 expression is related to tumor size. e lower the expression level, the larger the tumor. Besides, CX3CR1 is also a marker of T cell differentiation (33658501). ese chemokines are also significantly associated with the survival of patients with NSCLC.

Tumor microenvironment significantly affects diagnosis, survival, and clinical treatment sensitivity of tumor. Relevant studies have shown that immune cells of adaptive immune and innate immune system can penetrate into tumor tissue, forming tumor immune microenvironment and affecting tumor progression. Patients' survival following chemotherapy is influenced by the quantity of immune cells in the tumor. In this work, we used non-small-cell lung cancer mRNA expression data to create a microenvironment map of the internal immune system of tumor tissue. Combined with the analysis on immune cells combined with survival data of patients, it was found that there was a significant correlation between the survival of NSCLC patients and immature B cell, activated B cell, MDSC, effector memory CD4 T cell, eosinophil, and regulatory T cell. Next, we constructed the TICS scoring model and graded specific TICS score for patients in terms of prognosis-related immune cell content and its relationship with survival. TICS score can discriminate between patients with non-small-cell lung cancer who have a favourable prognosis and those who have a bad prognosis in terms of survival time. Furthermore, we identified TICS-related genes by using prognostic markers and mRNA expression profiles. We found that many chemokines were significantly upregulated in the high TICS group. For example, there are CX3CR1, CXCR4, CXCR5, and CCR7 which are commonly associated with the survival of NSCLC. Also, high expression of CX3CR1 and CCL19 can affect the immune differentiation of T cells, such as CD8 + T cells. Previous studies have shown that C3 level in biopsy tissues of NSCLC is certainly correlated (24819254) with infiltrating CD4 + and CD8 + T lymphocytes. Moreover, the result of functional enrichment showed that TICS-related genes were involved in a variety of immune-related biological progresses and signaling pathways, which indicates that immune-related genes affect the prognosis of NSCLC patients by regulating the immune process.",

Differential gene and enrichment analysis explains the prognosis-related molecular mechanism of NSCLC.

Based on ssGSEA algorithm, we used mRNA expression data of each patient to construct immune cell infiltration maps of NSCLC including 27 types of adaptive and innate immune cells. Central memory CD8 T cell, central memory CD4 T cell, and plasmacytoid dendritic cells are common immune cells in NSCLC tissues, which all exist in 81 patients.
