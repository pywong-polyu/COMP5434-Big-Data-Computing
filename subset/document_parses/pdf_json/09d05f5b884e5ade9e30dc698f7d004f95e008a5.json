Very few clinical studies in Qatar focused on gut microbiome. This study aimed to assess the awareness of healthcare professionals, scientists, and the general public on the role of gut microbiota in health and diseases and, more specifically, in disorders of the gut -brain axis such as neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) or gastrointestinal (GI) disorders. It also aimed to evaluate the readiness of the population to engage in clinical trials involving dietary interventions or fecal transplants. Methods: A total of 156 participants were recruited to answer questionnaires-from healthcare professionals and scientists (HSs; n \u00bc44) and the general public (n \u00bc112). Participants from the general public self-reported their diagnosis of NDDs-autism or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (n \u00bc36)-or GI diseases or disorders (n \u00bc18) or as having none of them (n \u00bc58). Two questionnaires for HSs and for the general public were distributed, and basic descriptive and statistical analyses were conducted using the Fisher's exact test. Results: Among the participating HSs, 95% admitted that they had minimum to no knowledge on the role of gut microbes in health and diseases, and only 15.9% felt that their peers were knowledgeable about it. Nevertheless, 97.7% of HSs thought that gut microbiota should be considered when devising treatment plans as 79.1% believed that gut dysbiosis is involved in the pathogenesis of diseases. For the",

However, no consensus was reached as to which microbial composition can be salvatory for a disease. A study by the NIH Human Microbiome Portfolio Analysis Team 2 reviewed the human microbiome projects ran over the past decade and concluded that there is no 'one size fits all' strategy for microbiomebased interventions for treating diseases. This is probably the reason why several teams across the globe have started clinical interventions that aim to correct the dysbiosis associated with a large spectrum of diseases. There are two types of trials as follows:",

However, only a small number are being performed in the Middle East and none in the Gulf region. 30, 31 In 2017, only nine studies containing the terms '(microbiota OR microbiome) AND Qatar' were recorded on the PubMed database ( Figure 1 ), whereas more than 10,000 were being published worldwide, with focuses on the multiple roles of the gut microbiome in the pathogenesis of diseases, including disorders along the gut -brain axis. This gap in Qatar's contribution to scientific knowledge around microbiome and microbiota was hypothesized to be reflective of a knowledge gap among the healthcare and scientific community and/or the general public, who were not ready to engage in clinical studies.",

However, some challenges are usually reported in studies conducting nutritional research such as the participants' baseline nutritional status, awareness, and motivation and engagement. For this reason, we have launched a pilot study in 2018 that aimed to assess the awareness of healthcare professionals and scientists (HSs) and the general public on the role of gut microbes in health and diseases and, more specifically, in diseases of the gut -brain axis such as autism spectrum disorders (ASDs), attention deficit hyperactivity disorders (ADHDs), and GI diseases including inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs; Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis), irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), and celiac disease, which are all under GI disorders.",

This study, by providing an overview of the state of knowledge and awareness of HSs, points at knowledge gaps that could lead to practice gaps. In addition, by investigating on the same among the public and on their readiness to engage in clinical interventions, we can draw nutritional baselines and list some of the important challenges to consider in future clinical studies. We will conclude on the feasibility of running dietary interventions among children with ASDs or IBDs in Qatar and the need and benefits of running public awareness campaigns on the role of the gut microbiota in NDDs and health and diseases in general.",

Interestingly, 97.7% of HS thought that the gut microbiota should be considered when devising treatment plans. This apparent contradiction reveals the unprecedented surge in microbiome studies that happened in the last few years (Figure 1 ), and its medialization might have actually imprinted minds in such a way that HS know that the gut microbiome plays important roles without fully understanding its mechanisms. Indeed, 79.1% of HS participants believed that gut dysbiosis is involved in the pathogenesis of diseases of developed countries, including not only ASD, ADHD, and IBD (as stated in the questionnaire) but also diabetes, obesity, and other autoimmune diseases. Several studies have investigated the impact of the mode of delivery in infant's gut microbiome. 32 -36 Curran et al. 37 first indicated in a meta-analysis that the gut microbiota of infants born via cesarean section (C-section) differs significantly from those infants born naturally. In another study, the same team observed that the increase in the observed risk of developing ADHD associated with C-section in siblings might actually be due to confounding factors, as it was observed only in emergency C-sections. 38 Tribe et al. 34 suggested that breastfeeding is an important factor to consider, especially in women who deliver via C-section as they often report breastfeeding issues with early cessation. Several confounding factors are progressively pointing to specific factors linked to C-section, such as the absence of labor or type of antibiotherapy used during C-section and susceptibility to develop candidiasis leading to early breastfeeding cessation. 36, 39 In our study, 84.1% of HS agreed, based on their professional experience, on the importance of the role of the gut microbiota and the mode of delivery in the pathogenesis of ASD or IBD. Participants from the general public were asked how they were born, and the results are depicted in Figure 2 . Although our sample size was relatively small, and no definite conclusion can be drawn (Fisher's exact test p values were 0.3861 and 0.24, respectively, for NDD and GI), the trend observed in the higher proportion of C-section among the ASD population is worth mentioning and deserves further investigations in a local cohort while including other possible confounding factors such as presence of labor, candidiasis, and duration of breastfeeding. 33 General public awareness A growing number of studies have highlighted the potential of beneficial microbes in the prevention, treatment, and management of diseases, including ASD and IBD, in both preclinical and clinical studies. 40 -45 We asked our participants if they had ever heard of studies on the role of gut microbes in health and diseases, and 54% said that they did (data not shown), with a higher proportion of them being from the GI group (Fisher's exact test p value was 0.0523; odds ratio: 0.29; Figure 3A ). Indeed, it makes sense that individuals with GI diseases or disorders are more likely to encounter and read scientific updates and studies on the microbiome by simply making searches on their own condition, which is already a GI disease. Similarly, they are also the ones who were aware, at a significantly higher proportion than the control, of the existence of clinical trials involving fecal microbiota transplants for their disease (Fisher's exact test p value was 0.01935; significant at p , 0.05, odds ratio: 0.226, 95% CI: 0.05359792-0.82876599; Figure 3B ). This suggests that the chance of belonging to the GI group when one is aware of the existence of fecal transplants is 0.226 than for someone who is not.",

At the time of the investigation, only 7 of 36 participants in the NDD group had heard about fecal transplant use for ASD, although a trial was already existing and recorded on the clinicaltrials.gov database. 46 However, the clinical trial conducted by Kand et al. 21 revealed unprecedented results on the benefits of fecal transplants in autism, and the number of studies on the role of microbiota in Qatar and worldwide is increasing ( Figure 1 ). Therefore, we hypothesize that the ASD community awareness about the role of microbiota in ASD could be currently higher than what is described in this paper, which is based on data collected in 2018. To conclude about awareness, the role of gut microbes in health and diseases, and especially through the gut -brain axis, is still unclear to both the scientific community and general public. However, since 2018, several clinical research studies on gut microbiome were awarded in Qatar, yielding several publications, which must have probably increased awareness since then. Yet, the first to have been exposed to this new set of information were probably individuals who suffered from a GI disorder or disease as GI diseases can easily be associated with gut microbes.",

            "text": "An interesting study by Greenhough et al. 47 highlighted the complexity of microbiome studies and how an interdisciplinary approach is fundamentally needed to raise awareness, involving social sciences and humanities, which could actually facilitate clinical studies and advances in microbiome studies. Greenhough et al. 47 proposed an agenda that is a great source of inspiration for not only HSs but also members of other disciplines to tackle eight priorities on microbiome research, such as the impact of this new knowledge on healthcare governance and practice and how it affects agricultural practices, social behaviors, and, consequently, the environmental microbial homeostasis and health. With the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, the relationships of humans and microbes have been questioned and been deeply affected by the use of chemicals such as sanitizers (with observation increase in resistance to chemicals in hands), microbiome convergence, and biodiversity decrease in some food plants. 48, 49 Clinical practice At the time of the investigation (2018), only 15.9% of the HSs who participated said that they have considered the implications of the gut microbiota in NDD or GI disorders during their practice. Approximately 31% said that they do discuss the role of the gut microbiome with their patients with an NDD or GI disorder. In addition, 47.7% of the same participants Although dysbiosis can occur at any period of life, a critical window has been described in microbiome studies, during which any alteration of the gut microbiota composition could lead to sustained dysbiosis through life, thus playing an important role in the pathogenesis of diseases. 50, 51 On the other hand, recent studies have explored antibiotic misuse in Qatar and revealed that misconceptions about antibiotics are common in the population, which lead to extensive use of antibiotics when they are not needed. 52 -54 We were interested to know whether our participants recall having been exposed to multiple courses of antibiotics before their third-year anniversary. Fisher's exact test was used to compare proportions of the control versus NDD groups who were exposed (or not) to multiple courses of antibiotics before three years old as self-reported by participants. The results in Figure 4 indicate a highly significant difference as the p value was 0.0003, odds ratio 0.19, and 95% CI 0.06703852-0.51146584. The result of this study suggests that the chance of belonging to the NDD group when one was exposed to antibiotics at an early age is 0.19 than for someone who was not. However, this result needs to be further explored using a bigger sample size. For the GI group, Fisher's exact test p value was 0.1319 (odds ratio 0.41) and was not significant (Figure 4) . This important result about the role of early antibiotic exposure in the pathogenesis of autism has been reported by other studies. 55 Two metanalyses concluded that the data are conflicting and that the analyses need to also consider prenatal antibiotic exposures as strong associations. 56, 57 Relocation Some studies mentioned that relocation to a new country was a factor that was associated with diseases such as ASD, 58 pointing at the possible role of lifestyle habits. 59 We have asked participants from the public whether their (or their child's) symptoms increased after their relocation to Qatar, and 75.4% indicated that symptoms did not noticeably increase, whereas 24.6% affirmed that they did. This question was not investigated among healthcare professionals.",

Interestingly, a mismatch between the real readiness of the public and the readiness as perceived by professionals was noted. Of HSs, 38.1% thought that families would not be open to clinical trials involving intensive dietary changes, but when the same question was asked to families, 87.96% of public participants stated that they were ready to engage in clinical interventions that involve intensive dietary changes.",

Although this study shall be extended to evaluate the real situation, the public could benefit from popularization of scientific studies in the gut-brain axis. 73 LIMITATIONS Some of the limitations of this study to consider are the relatively small sample size among the HS group (n \u00bc44). Conclusions drawn about HSs need to be considered in this context. Nevertheless, the publication counts reported (Figure 1 ) still reflect a need to raise awareness among this group. Participants who answered the questionnaire were mostly from the public with 112 participants, which represent 71% of total participants. The study did not investigate whether taking the survey online or on paper had an impact on answers. It would have been interesting to learn from healthcare professionals what their antibiotic prescription habits are for infants. However, this was not conducted in the study. Further explorations are needed to understand the role of early exposure to antibiotics in the pathogenesis of NDD and GI disorders.",
