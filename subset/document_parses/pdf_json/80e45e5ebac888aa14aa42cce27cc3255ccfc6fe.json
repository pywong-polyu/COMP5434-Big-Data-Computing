            "text": "The global spread of SARS-CoV-2 lead to the most challenging pandemic in this century, posing major economic and health challenges worldwide. Revealing host genes essential for infection by multiple variants of SASR-CoV-2 can provide insights into the virus pathogenesis, and facilitates the development of novel broad-spectrum host-directed therapeutics. Here, employing genomescale CRISPR screens, we provide a comprehensive data-set of cellular factors that are exploited by WT-SARS-CoV-2 as well as two additional recently emerged variants of concerns (VOCs), Alpha and Beta. These screens identified known and novel host factors critical for SARS-CoV-2 infection, including various components belonging to the Clathrin-dependent transport pathway, ubiquitination and Heparan sulfate biogenesis. In addition, the host metabolic pathways pertaining to mitochondrial activity as well as phosphatidylglycerol biosynthesis processes appeared to have major anti-viral functions. Comparative analysis between the different VOCs revealed the receptor KREMEN2 as unique gene required only to the Alpha variant, providing a possible explanation for the increased infectivity of this variant. Furthermore, the analysis identified GATA6, a zinc finger transcription factor, as an essential pro-viral gene for all variants inspected. We reveal that GATA6 directly regulates ACE2 transcription and is accordingly, critical for SARS-CoV-2 cell entry. Analysis of clinical samples collected from SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals showed an elevated level of GATA6, indicating the important role GATA6 may be playing in COVID-19 pathogenesis. Finally, pharmacological inhibition of GATA6 results in down-modulation of ACE2 and consequently to inhibition of the viral infectivity. Overall, we show GATA6 represents a target for the development of anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapeutic strategies and reaffirm the value of the CRISPR loss-of-function screens in providing a list of potential new targets for therapeutic interventions.",

            "text": "Coronaviruses are enveloped, positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses with a genome of approximately 30 kb in length [1] . The initial steps of SARS-CoV-2 infection involve the specific binding of the coronavirus spike protein (S) to the cellular entry receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) [2] [3] [4] [5] . The binding to the receptor and the subsequent membrane fusion commences the process of viral entry into the host cell by endocytosis allowing the virion to release the genetic material into the cytoplasm where it is translated into continuous polypeptides that are cleaved into 16 nonstructural proteins, which then facilitate the transcription of sub-genomic RNA that is translated into structural and accessory proteins. These viral proteins rearrange host membranes to form the endoplasmic reticulumlocalized viral replication complex (RC) in which the viral genomic RNA is replicated by the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) complex. The assembled components further undergo maturation in the Golgi apparatus to form the mature virion that is released outside the host cell by exocytosis [1, [6] [7] [8] . Every step of the viral life cycle, from entry to budding, is orchestrated through interactions with host cellular proteins. For example, cellular proteases, such as TMPRSS2, Cathepsin L, and Furin, are exploited for the cleavage of the viral spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, mediating efficient membrane fusion with the infected cell [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] . Identification of additional key host proteins involved in the various steps of the infection is essential for the development of countermeasures and represents the objective of intense efforts. Several proteomics studies addressed the SARS-CoV-2-host interactions by utilizing immunoprecipitation mass spectrometry (IP-MS) of affinity-tagged viral proteins and proximity labeling of the virus replicase complex [14] [15] [16] [17] . The proteomics approach revealed comprehensive interactomes and physical contacts between many viral and cellular proteins, and highlighted potential targets for drug repurposing. Yet, this approach cannot provide direct information about the essentiality of these host components for enabling the SARS-CoV-2 life cycle. Another strategy to explore SARS-CoV-2-host interactions is to disrupt individual genes of the entire host genome and screen for genes whose disruption results in resistance to viral infection and consequently to host-cell survival. Several reports documented genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9-mediated loss-of-function screens and identify host factors that are functionally required for SARS-CoV-2 infection in various cell types [10, [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] .",

Covid-19 vaccines showed as high as 95% efficacy in preventing clinical cases and 100% efficacy in preventing severe disease with original viral variants [28, 29] . The average mutation rate of SARS-CoV-2 remains low and steady. However, the continuing global spread of the SARS-CoV-2, together with selective pressure for immune escape, led to the emergence of new SARS-CoV-2 variants raising concerns regarding their relative ability to escape from natural and vaccine-induced immunity. Four novel variants that generated different patterns in the pandemic expansion, are of considerable public-health concern, as concluded by the WHO organization following judicious monitoring and classification of the new lineages (hence eloquently coined VOC, acronym for variants of concern): (i) Alpha (also known as B. The Beta variant emerged independently of the Alpha variant but shares with it mutations at several loci. The significant anxiety caused by this variant, owe to the co-occurrence of the N501Y mutation in the spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD, also found in the Alpha variant) with additional mutations K417N/T and E484K. Viral variants with the triple combination of mutations exhibit reduced susceptibility to vaccine-induced and convalescent sera [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] . Fortunately, the Beta variant is less abundant with a reported worldwide daily prevalence of 1% [42, 43] . In addition to the assessment of full immunological and clinical implications of the SARS-CoV-2 new variants, there is an urgent need for a more profound understanding of their biology, and for integrating this information towards the development of therapeutic approaches targeting host elements essential to all variants.",

The library employed for the screen was the Brunello CRISPR library composed of 76,441 targeting single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) with an average of four gRNAs per gene and 1,000 non-targeting control sgRNAs [44] . For the identification of host factors exhibiting either broad or restricted essentiality for the different variants of SARS-Cov-2, Calu-3 cells transduced with the CRISPR library, were infected separately with each of the SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs): SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7(Alpha), SARS-CoV-2 B.1.351 (Beta), and the original wild-type (WT) SARS-CoV-2 (GISAID accession EPI_ISL_406862). Genomic DNA was harvested from surviving cells 7-9 days post infection, and sgRNAs abundance was determined by sequencing (Fig.1A) . Integration of the datasets generated by screening cells infected with these various SARS-CoV-2 variants identified numerous genes which upon disruption, conferred resistance to death by viral infection (referred to as pro-viral) or sensitization to viral infection (referred to as anti-viral). The sgRNA score-distribution of the full library and that of sgRNA targeting the top hits for pro-and anti-viral genes demonstrated high technical quality of the screens ( Fig 1B) . As expected, the pro-viral gene, exhibiting the highest enrichment score was ACE2, the receptor serving as the portal for SARS-CoV-2 cell-entry (log fold change (LFC)=1.534, false discovery rate (FDR)= 0.007).",

Interestingly, the transcription level of GATA6 was shown to be elevated in the lung transcriptome of Covid-19 patients [45] . Other top pro-viral hits included CUL5, IRF6, AP1G1, EP300 and EXTL2 ( Figure 1C, 1D) . The CUL5 gene encodes Cullin5, a core component of multiple SCF-like ECS (Elongin-Cullin 2/5-SOCS-box protein) E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase complexes, which mediate the ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation of target proteins. While ubiquitination of viral proteins can be used by the host as a defense mechanism by destroying the incoming pathogen, viruses have adapted to exploit this cellular process to enhance various steps of the replication cycle and increase pathogenesis [46] .",

IRF6 gene is a transcriptional activator with well-established role in the development of the epidermis. A recent study suggests a role for IRF6 in the modulation of the NFk-B-pathway that influences cell-survival by regulating host responses during viral infection, such as cytokine production [49] . AP1G1 (Adaptor Related Protein Complex 1 Subunit Gamma 1) encodes a component of clathrincoated vesicles that were shown to mediate endocytosis and intracellular trafficking of SARS-CoV-2 [50, 51] .

Interestingly, in a recent search for functional modifiers of ACE2 surface abundance, EP300 was found to regulate ACE2 transcription and hence to influence cellular susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection [53] . EXTL2 encodes a glycosyltransferase involved in the chain elongation step of heparan sulfate (HS) biosynthesis [54, 55] . Several heparan sulfate biosynthetic genes were also markedly enriched in other CRISPR knockout SARS-CoV-2 screens conducted in Huh7.5.1 cells [22, 23] consistent with a recent report that SARS-CoV-2 infection is co-dependent on heparan sulfate and ACE2 [56] . Since HS is ubiquitously expressed on the surfaces and in the extracellular matrix of all cell types, EXTL2 may play a central pro-viral role through heparan sulfate production that may determine SARS-CoV-2 tropism. RPP21 encodes a subunit of nuclear ribonuclease P, which processes the 5-prime leader sequence of precursor tRNAs [57] . UQCRC1 encodes a component of the ubiquinol-cytochrome c oxidoreductasel that is part of the mitochondrial electron transport chain which drives oxidative phosphorylation. Similarly to a previous survey [10] , the present screen also distinguished a significant enrichment of mitochondrial ribosomal proteins (MRPS) genes (e.g., MRPL17, MRPS33, MRPL41, MRPL34, MRPL53 and MRPS12) (highlighted in red in Figure 1D ). The emerging notion of the role of mitochondrial dynamics in viral infections, unequivocally attribute mitochondria with a key role for cellular metabolism and innate immunity. Overall, the corroboration of previously reported entry factors reported here, together with novel pro-viral host genes and the implied functional pathways, demonstrates the high potential of CRISPR-knockout screens to distinguish targets for host dependent anti-viral therapy.

Pyrrothiogatain, previously reported to inhibit the DNA-binding activity of GATA6 and other members of the GATA family [71] , was tested for its ability to induce downregulation of ACE2 and subsequent inhibition of viral infection. As expected, the drug exhibited a dose-dependent inhibition of GATA6 accompanied by insignificant cytotoxicity in Calu-3 cells (Fig. S2) . Inhibition of GATA6 resulted in a lower ACE2 expression (Fig. 5G, Fig.S1 ) confirming the causal connection between GATA6 and ACE2. Next, cells pretreated with Pyrrothiogatain for 48 hours were infected with SARS-CoV-2. Immunofluorescence analysis evidenced cytoplasmic SARS-CoV-2 staining in untreated cells while significantly reduced infection was observed in Pyrrothiogatain-treated cells (Fig. 5H) .

This exemplifies the expected absolute dependency of the virus on host factors for translation of its genes. Another large group of anti-viral genes were found to participate in the reported to regulate the innate immune response in lungs[58] and consequently was suggested as a treatment against SARS-CoV-2 infection by restoring the lung tissue[59]. The current results suggest also that phosphatidylglycerols may play a supporting role in SARS-CoV-2 infection. No functional pathways were found to be significantly represented by analysis of genes found as essential (pro-viral) for SARS-CoV-2 infection.For further inspection of the pro-viral genes, STRING-db interaction network analysis was employed for the top 200 enriched genes(Fig. 2B). The connected network components annotated using REACTOME pathways functionally implicated several cellular pathways. A large group of these genes, including the largest cluster, is related to immune system functions, and includes the genes NFKB1, IRF6, IL2Ra and EP300. In addition, the analysis identified gene groups belonging to lipid metabolism, and genes related to vesicle mediated transport, both functions known to be important determinants of viral infection.Differential analysis of host-factors dependencies exhibited by variants of SARS-CoV-2Reported differences in the infectivity as well as in the evolution of the disease caused by different variants of SARS-CoV-2 indicate that these emerging variants may require both common and distinct host factors. These shared and diverged host requirements may enable a better understanding of the host-pathogen interactions characterizing SARS-CoV-2 infection, and most importantly may facilitate future therapies. Accordingly, a comparative analysis of the datasets of the screens involving either one of the SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern: conducted. The individual variant analysis enabled distinction of the top-scoring host-genes involved in the infection of each SARS-CoV-2 lineage(Fig. 3A). The cellular entry factor, ACE2, was found to be highly enriched for all lineages, illustrating the robustness of our screens and illustrating that the main mechanism for entry into the target cells is similar for the three SARS-CoV-2 variants. Another host gene that was consistently highly enriched in the screens of cells infected by the three variants was the transcription factor GATA6. GATA6 role in SARS-CoV-2 infection was so far not reported and will be extensively addressed below. Conversely, the analysis identified different genes specifically involved in the infection by either one of the variants. Such are ARIH2 and CHMP2B that exhibited a higher enrichment score in the screen of the cells infected by the Alpha and Beta variants, respectively. Additional significantly enriched genes are highlighted inFigure 3A.Next, we assessed the extent of host-factor sharing between cells infected by the different variants, by Venn analysis of the top 100 genes which emerged as viral infection facilitators in the genome-wide screens (Figure 3B). The analysis evidenced that only the 2 genes, ACE2 and GATA6, were scored high in each of the three datasets, indicating that their key-role in the course of SARS-CoV-2 life cycle is lineage-independent. With the exception of ACE2 and GATA6, a low overlap in the top-ranked hits was observed: only 1 gene was found to be common to cells infected by Alpha and the WT variant (HEATR5B), 3 common genes to Beta and the WT variant (TMEM127, CALB2, ADIPOR1) and 5 to the Alpha and Beta variants (OSBPL10, AMBP, KIF5B, KMT2C, SMYD1). These partially mutual pro-viral genes are involved in biological processes such as endocytosis regulation (HEATR5B), mTOR signaling (TMEM127), calcium signaling (CALB2), fatty acid oxidation and glucose uptake (ADIPOR1), lipid biogenesis (OSBPL10) and histone modification (KMT2C, SMYD1). To further distinguish the role of these host-genes in the infection of each of the variants, a pairwise correlation of the genome-wide datasets was conducted, (Fig. 3C). The pro-viral genes, ACE2, GATA6 and VEPH1 were consistently highly enriched with all variants, while the anti-viral genes NHLRC2, GART, LARS2, RPP21, PMPCB, CIAO1 and ELP5 were depleted for all three variants. Most interestingly, some genes were enriched in the screen conducted with one mutant while depleted in the screens carried-out with other variants. One of these genes, KREMEN2 (highlighted in figure 3C) was highly enriched following infection with the Alpha variant and exhibited an opposite pattern in the screens involving the Beta variant and the WT SARS-CoV-2 suggesting that this gene may therefore fulfill a distinct role during the life cycle of the Alpha variant. Notably, the proteins KREMEN1 and KREMEN2 have been identified as co-receptors for Dickkopf (Dkk)proteins, hallmark secreted antagonists of canonical Wnt signaling[60,61]. In addition, KREMEN1 serves as host-cell entry receptors for a major group of Enteroviruses[62]. Remarkedly, in a recent screen in search of additional SRAS-CoV-2 receptors, KREMEN1 was identified as an alternative viral-entry receptor[63]. Thus, our observation suggests that KREMEN2 may play a similar role during the life cycle of the Alpha variant specifically, consequently contributing to its enhanced infectivity compared with other SARS-CoV-2 variants. Overall, the comparative analysis shows that the survival-based CRISPR screen provides datasets of host factors common and distinct for a variety of SARS-CoV-2 lineages that should be further validated and taken under consideration for the design of broad-spectrum therapies for controlling SARS-CoV-2 infection.GATA6 is essential for viral entry of SARS-CoV-2The transcription factor GATA6, emerged as the second-strongest pro-viral host factor (inferior only to the viral receptor ACE2) for all three variants tested in the screens. GATA6 is a member of a small family of zinc finger DNA-binding transcription factors that play an important role in the regulation of cellular differentiation. Of note, GATA6 was shown to promote the transcription of SFTPA gene, which is involved in immune and inflammatory responses, and lowers the surface tension in the alveoli[64,65]. Both GATA6 and SFTPA genes were upregulated in SARS-CoV-2-infected lung, while the GATA6 antagonist LMCD1 was downregulated[45]. To confirm the essentiality of GATA6 for SARS-CoV-2 infection the expression of GATA6 in Calu-3 cells was abrogated by CRISPRmediated targeting of GATA6, followed by inspecting the sensitivity of cells to SARS-CoV-2 Infection. CRISPR-mediated ACE2 disruption in Calu-3 cells served as a positive control. The gene targeting manipulation indeed resulted in depletion of GATA6 and ACE2 expression as measured by Real-Time PCR analyses(Fig.",

The analysis demonstrated that COVID-19 patients exhibited significantly higher levels of GATA6 than controls (p<0.05) (Fig 4E). Of note, the analysis did not reveal statistically relevant differences in ACE2 expression between COVID-19 and control healthy individuals. This observation further demonstrates that GATA6 may be involved in the susceptibility to viral infection, and suggests that GATA6 by itself is upregulated in response to infection by a regulatory inductive circuit differs from that of ACE2 receptor.To further elucidate which viral life cycle step is facilitated by GATA6 expression, SARS-CoV-2 infection was visualized by applying immunofluorescent labeling of the virus in infected WT in comparison to GATA6-disrupted cells. The analysis enabled detection of SARS-CoV-2 in the cytoplasm of WT cells. In contrast, there was significant reduction of the infection of SARS-CoV-2 in the GATA6-disrupted cells (Fig. 5A) suggesting that GATA6 facilitates an early step in the viral life cycle possibly related to the entry of the virus into the cells.",

These include known and novel host-factors such as the viral receptor ACE2 and various components belonging to the Clathrindependent transport pathway, ubiquitination and Heparan sulfate biogenesis. In addition, our comparative analysis highlights commonalities and differences between SARS-CoV-2 variants and enables the identification of the receptorKREMEN2 as unique gene required only to the Alpha variant. The differences exhibited by the viral variants with respect to the essentiality of specific host factors for their life-cycle is of outmost importance since they may provide an explanation for the reported differences in their pathogenicity, infectivity and disease progression. Our study found an absolute requirement of GATA6 for infection by WT-SARS-CoV-2 as well as the Alpha and Beta variants. Furthermore, analysis of clinical samples of COVID-19 infected patients showed an elevated level of GATA6, suggesting that in the course of the disease, viral-induced modulation of the level of GATA6 occurs. Further investigations revealed that GATA6 regulates ACE2 expression and is critical for the entry step of SARS-CoV-2. Notably, pharmacological inhibition of GATA6 results in down-modulation of ACE2 and consequently to inhibition of the viral infectivity suggesting that this protein may serve as a therapy target. Taken together, these findings represent a wide source of information for the understanding of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis and for future development of host-directed therapies.

(iii) Gamma, (also known as the P.1 lineage, 501Y.V3 variant), first identified in Brazil (iv) Delta (also known as B.1.617.2. variant) originally surfaced in India [30-33]. The Alpha lineage has a total of 17 nonsynonymous mutations relative to the original Wuhan strain, of which 7 replacements and 2 deletions reside in the spike protein. The Alpha variant was shown to be significantly more infectious than other lineages (increasing the effective reproduction number, Rt, by a factor of 1.35) which resulted in its rapid global expansion. As of May 2021, the variant has been detected in over 100 countries, with a worldwide daily prevalence of over 75% [34].",
