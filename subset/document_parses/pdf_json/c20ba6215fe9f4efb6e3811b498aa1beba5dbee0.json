Humans unexposed to SARS-CoV-2 may harbor antibodies that neutralize SARS-CoV-2 in cell culture (1) along with T-cells that recognize epitopes shared between SARS-CoV-2 and CCCoVs (2, 3) . Henns et al. (4) detected neutralizing antibodies against the NL63 CCCoV in serum from subjects with mild COVID-19, but not in those with severe disease. On the other hand, Schwaiger et al. (5) reported that antibodies against CCCoVs had low functional avidity for SARS-CoV-2, which argues against clinically relevant cross-reactivity. These and other recent reports (6) emphasize that additional studies are required to determine whether or not cross-reactivity translates into clinically relevant cross-immunity.",

In accordance, we reported that homologous infections of humans with CCCoV are approximately 10 times less common than heterologous infections (9), thus implying that infection with CCCoV entails significant protective immunity against the homologous virus. Analysis of the risk and severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients with verified previous CCCoV infections might, therefore, inform the degree of clinically relevant cross-immunity.",

Among patients in the database, we assessed the risk of subsequent SARS-CoV-2 infection, as determined by rtPCR detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in respiratory specimens or by the presence of IgG antibodies in blood against the nucleocapsid (Architect, Abbott, Abbott Park, IL, USA) and the nucleocapsid/spike protein (iFlash, YHLO, Shenzhen, China) of SARS-CoV-2. More than 100,000 patients were tested for SARS-CoV-2 at our department during February to November 2020 and of those, 8, 298 had at least one previous result in the above-referenced respiratory tract infection database prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. We also utilized hospital records to determine the severity of COVID-19 disease (hospitalization/intensive care unit referral or not). The proportion of SARS-CoV-2 positivity among patients with previous respiratory infections was compared against patients with no previously verified infection using chi2-tests. The study was approved by the Swedish Ethical Review Board (application no. 2020-03276).",

The incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection was similar in patients with a history of CCCoV infection as in those with a previous common and immunologically unrelated respiratory infection (rhinovirus infection).

In the adjusted analyses, previously verified infections, including those caused by CCCoV, did not confer significant protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection or hospitalization. Unexpectedly, patients with previously verified infection with alphacoronaviruses showed significantly higher risk for hospitalization after adjustment for age (odds ratio 2.82, P=0.03; Supplementary table 1).A limitation to these analyses is that serial, systematic monitoring of CCCoV infections was not available. Our study, thus, likely underestimates the incidence of CCCoV infections in this patient cohort. Nevertheless, our results support the conclusions by Schwaiger et al.suggesting that past infection with the four endemic CCCoV does not entail clinically significant protection against SARS-CoV-2.",
