Recent advances in natural language processing have shown that text is an effective medium for informing moral change, but no attempt has been made to quantify the origins of these changes. We present a novel unsupervised framework for tracing textual sources of moral change toward entities through time. We characterize moral change with probabilistic topical distributions and infer the source text that exerts prominent influence on the moral time course. We evaluate our framework on a diverse set of data ranging from social media to news articles. We show that our framework not only captures fine-grained human moral judgments, but also identifies coherent source topics of moral change triggered by historical events. We apply our methodology to analyze the news in the COVID-19 pandemic and demonstrate its utility in identifying sources of moral change in high-impact and real-time social events.",

Despite this importance, people's morals are not static but change over time (Bloom, 2010) .

For instance, an entity like Bill Clinton could be applauded for charity at one time but deprecated for a sex scandal at another time. Similarly, moral sentiment toward a more general entity like policemen could undergo a negative shift due to acts on racial discrimination. Existing methods for moral sentiment detection typically take an aggregate approach and do not focus on analyzing moral sentiment of entities (Garten et al., 2016; Mooijman et al., 2018; Xie et al., 2019) . Here, we develop a methodology to identify textual sources that give rise to moral sentiment change toward an entity. Our work takes a similar approach to detecting sources of gender bias in text by locating a set of documents that influence gender bias in word embeddings (Brunet et al., 2019) .",

Capturing events as topic distributions, we approach this problem by decomposing textual mentions of an entity into topics and quantifying the contributions of different topics toward moral sentiment of an entity. We attribute the origins of moral change as topics that contribute saliently to changes in the time course of moral sentiment. We compare this approach with classic work on influence function (Cook and Weisberg, 1980) , which has been used to quantify the effect of samples in statistical estimation (see also Koh and Liang, 2017; Brunet et al., 2019) . Figure 1 illustrates our framework. Figure 1a shows the generative process in our topic-based approach. Given an entity (e.g., Donald Trump) and its mentions in a set of documents (e.g., tweets or news articles), we wish to infer the most salient source topic(s) that gave rise to changes in the moral sentiment time course about that entity. Here as an illustration the moral sentiment toward Donald Trump is analyzed through a set of news articles. Each article includes mentions of this entity, specified as topical distributions that contribute toward the perceived moral sentiment of the entity (see Figure 1b) . As moral sentiment of the entity changes over time, our framework uses probabilistic inference jointly with change point analysis to extract the most salient topic and its relevant source documents that underlie these changes. We show how our approach predicts fine-grained human moral judgment variation across topics and identifies influential and coherent text as the sources of moral change for both historical and modern events.",

Other related work has characterized moral biases in language models Xie et al., 2019) , and contributed new datasets for tasks such as automatic ethical judgment and inference of sociomoral norms (Hoover et al., 2020; Lourie et al., 2020; Forbes et al., 2020) . Existing work has also studied moral sentiment change over time (Xie et al., 2019) showing how word embeddings capture hidden moral biases underlying different concepts (e.g., slavery) in history. This model uses MFD words as seeds and a hierarchical framework to capture moral change in three tiers: moral relevance, moral polarity, and fine-grained moral foundations. 1 Here we go beyond this line of research by developing an unsupervised framework that automatically identifies sources of moral change toward entities in text.",

To calculate count(m, e, o), we count the number of tweets from topic o that contain entity e, and were annotated with moral sentiment dimension m in MFTC. To prepare ground-truth data, we take the following steps: 1) For the moral relevance dimension, if more than half of the annotators annotate a tweet \"non-moral\", we consider the tweet as morally irrelevant. 2) For the moral polarity dimension, if the majority of annotations fall under the positive fine-grained categories, the moral polarity of the tweet is positive (and negative otherwise). 3) For the foundation categories, each tweet is given the label of the category receiving the majority vote from the annotators. If more than one category satisfies this condition, we randomly assign one of them to the tweet. We also used graded proportions instead of binary ground-truth labels and obtained similar results. We analyzed moral judgment on the 53 most frequent entities in the MFTC that appear under at least two topics. The entities include hashtags, mentions, and the named entities such as people, organizations, groups, and concepts. 5 We first consider a topic-based model that explicitly uses topic information and applies static word embeddings to infer moral sentiment variation across topics. For each moral dimension m, entity e, and topic o we derive the following probability using the methodology from Section 3: P (m|e, o) \u221d d\u2208tweets P e (m|d)P (o|d). We use Word2Vec word embeddings (Mikolov et al., 2013) to represent each tweet as a single vector. We also consider two alternative topic-free models using static and contextual embeddings, where topic information is discarded in moral sentiment inference, i.e., P (m|e, o) = P (m|e). We use BERT (Devlin et al., 2019) in the contextual embedding model to represent tweets. Similarly for the centroid model, instead of using the static embeddings of the seed words in MFD, we use BERT to embed their definitions from the online version of the Oxford English Dictionary (OED). 6 Each model infers P (m|e, o) for all entities, topics, and moral dimensions. We compare these probabilities with ground-truth moral judgments P (m|e, o) using both F 1 score and Pearson's correlation. We consider estimates of P (m|e, o) and P (m|e, o) meaningful if 1) the entity appears in at least one of the tweets in topic o, and 2) there is at least one tweet in topic o containing entity e that satisfies the 3-tier hierarchical structure, i.e., moral polarity of an entity is only estimated when it is morally relevant, and virtuous/vice moral foundations sentiments are estimated only for morally positive/negative input. A correlation test is performed on the samples that satisfy the two criteria in both model and human judgment. F 1 score quantifies the proportion of samples that they agree on. Table 1 summarizes our results in this task. We observe that the topic-based model best accounts for the variation in human moral judgment across topics for the entities analyzed, both in terms of the F 1 scores and fine-grained correlation values.",

We assess the topic-based source model on its ability to identify the moral changes at the historical incidents and locate topics and source text (i.e., news articles) relevant to these events. We also use the established influence function (Cook and Weisberg, 1980 ) as a baseline model for comparison. Evaluation metrics. We consider a baseline inspired by influence function (Cook and Weisberg, 1980) to retrieve a set of documents as the textual source of moral change. We compare this set to the documents retrieved by the topic-based source To assess models based on degree of influence, we use \u2206J. We first generate a null distribution via perturbing the dataset. The dataset used here is a set of documents published in t \u223c t + \u2206t that mention entity e (i.e., D e,t\u223ct+\u2206t ). To construct the null distribution, we choose a random set of documents from D e,t\u223ct+\u2206t , denoted as D * , and measure the influence of set D * on moral sentiment at a change point using \u2206J in Equation 4. We repeat this process until we generate 10, 000 random document sets. The set of documents that minimizes \u2206J significantly (\u03b1 = 0.05) compared to the null distribution would be the source text. These documents form a subset that provides the maximal perturbation to the moral sentiment estimated at the change point. For the topic-based model, we select the source set by choosing documents with the highest p(topic = o|d), where o is the topic minimizing Equation 2. The size of the source documents set for both the influence function and topic-based model would be 10% of |D e,t\u223ct+\u2206t |. We then compare \u2206J of these two sets. A lower value for \u2206J indicates greater influence and hence a more effective identification of the source documents.",

Bush for September 11 attacks (2001), China for the SARS outbreak (2002) (2003) (2004) , George W. Bush and Saddam Hussein for the Iraq invasion (2003) (2004) . The time resolution for our analysis is by month. For each entity and event, we extract all the articles published in NYT that mention the entity at least once. We use the dynamic topic model to derive 10 topics for each of the entities in the mentioned periods. We focus on assessing the models along the moral polarity dimension that has relatively clear-cut ground-truth for the historical incidents. Table 2 summarizes the result per entity and event. First, all the topics identified by the topicbased source model align with the (advent of) his-torical events. For instance, the negative change in the moral polarity toward George H. W. Bush detected between 1990-07 and 1991-02 is associated with the topic of Iraq and Saddam Hussein. Comparisons on \u2206J between the topic-based model and influence function indicate that these methods are equally effective in terms of the influence of the source documents (p = 0.348 via paired t-test), while the topic-based model significantly outperforms the random baseline (p < 0.01). Moreover, the topic-based model significantly outperforms the influence function and the random baseline (p < 0.05) in the expected coherence of the retrieved source documents (i.e., E[H]). This set of results shows that the topic-based model is on par with the established influence function retrieving influential source documents that underlie moral sentiment change, and it is significantly more ef-fective in selecting coherent articles relevant to the source of moral change. It is also important to note that although the influence function is designed to retrieve the most influential documents, it is computationally prohibitive to exhaustively search all possible documents, and here we applied a random search. In contrast, the topic-based model can also retrieve a set of influential documents, but it does not require an exhaustive iteration through all possible sets.

The topics selected for each change point align well with the notable incidences in COVID-19 pandemic (as annotated), suggesting how such source events can be traced in short time windows from text. The top row shows the time course of moral relevance for Donald Trump. Some relevant topic words are china, blame, disinformation, and asian. The retrieved relevant words in the middle row, reflecting a moral polarity change are flynn, ratcliffe, fbi, and investigation. The bottom row shows similar analyses for subversion which is one of the 10 moral foundations. The changing point occurs at week of 2020-05-18, and the relevant terms include george floyd, police, protest, and riot. For a more in-depth analysis, we apply the topic-based source model to all four entities. The table in Appendix C summarizes the results. Certain events during the pandemic had significant impact on how the entities are morally portrayed in the news. For example, George Floyd incident is attributed to be the source of the increase in subversion for Donald Trump. The shift happens after the week starting on May 18 th , which is close to the incident date May 25 th . Our model also identifies context when an entity becomes morally relevant. For example, it finds an increase in moral relevance for Anthony Fauci during June 22 nd to July 27 th with source topics concerning the conspiracy theories of COVID-19 treatment in social media, and the conflicts between Fauci and Trump.",

For instance, an increase in the moral relevance of an entity can be driven by an increase in moral authority, which may or may not involve any positive or negative sentiment (see Appendix C for examples).
