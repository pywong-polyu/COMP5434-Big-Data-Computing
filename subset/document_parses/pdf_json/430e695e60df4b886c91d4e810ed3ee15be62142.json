The external bidimensional factor of familiarity with digital tools, which is not usually explained by the TAM, was included, and evaluated. Following a four-stage scale development technique, a seven-dimensional 25-item survey was developed, which includes two external correlated variables: familiarity with high-tech digital tools and familiarity with traditional digital tools, two mediator variables-computer anxiety, and perceived barriers, and three response variables, perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use and intention to use. The initial version of the survey was administered on 250 undergraduate students. Next, for another sample of 206 students, latent dimensions of the survey were tested using exploratory factor analysis. The structure of the survey was validated in two other subsequent stages with one sample of 262 responses of undergraduates and one of 310 responses of master's students from two different universities. All students who agreed to participate in research attended blended learning. The validity, reliability and invariance of the instrument were established by psychometric analyses. Collected data indicated that the survey has an adequate multifactorial structure that is reliable and invariant across degree levels.

This output does not justify the influence of familiarity with traditional tools on digital tools acceptance; it also explores how this dimension indirectly influences the digital tools adoption in blended learning context. For both degree levels, this study confirms the mediating role of the usefulness between the familiarity with traditional tools and digital tools acceptance. It is interesting to mention that the mediating role of the perceived usefulness concluded in this study supports the view of Rakoczy and collaborators [91] . The utility perception of DETs plays an important positive role for all users, regardless of the degree level they are enrolled in, as opposed to anxiety, which also has a significant but negative direct contribution to the model. Unlike the traditional tools, the modern ones (interactive boards, services based on cloud software or scientific software) have only an indirect, but statistically significant influence on the intention of use, the level of familiarity with modern tools being about 20% lower than in the case of the traditional ones. The familiarity with traditional digital tools leads the student, regardless of the degree level, to adopt DETs resources in blended learning. Familiarity with modern digital resources has only an indirect influence on the intention of use, the perception of ease of use having also a mediating role, as shown by Davis and Wiedenbeck [92] . Through the path analysis, this research validated the mediator role of computer anxiety in digital tools adoption in a blended learning context.

The utility is a main factor of influence of the intention of use, independent of the university degree level of the learner, a result similar to that published by Abdullah and collaborators [37] . Ease of use influences directly and indirectly the intention of use of all students. The anxiety mediator factor had a significant direct and indirect negative influence on the intention of use. This result is similar to most psychological research that indicates a negative correlation between anxiety and cognitive performance on tests [94, 95] . The anxiety mediator factor had a significant direct negative influence on the perception of utility for all students, regardless of the level of education. However, only in the case of master's students, indirect influence of anxiety on the perception of the utility, through the perception of barriers, could be highlighted. The perception of barriers has significantly influenced the perception of the utility, both for undergraduate and master's students. An essential difference was noted between the master's students and undergraduate students in the relationship between the intention to adopt DETs and the utility. The link between the intention to adopt digital technologies in a mixed learning context and the perception of their usefulness is much stronger for undergraduate students than for those enrolled in the master's program. Specifically, regarding the intention to adopt digital technologies in a mixed learning process, which implies the use of both groups of educational resources, those intended for \"face-to-face\" learning simultaneously with those of e-learning. Ease of use directly and indirectly influences the intention to use of all students. Users' perceptions of utility and ease to use digital tools have been shown by various research to be critical factors that influence the adoption of digital technologies in education [71] . These conclusions are similar to those obtained in this research. The contribution made by present study consists of the construction of a simply but reliable and valid tool, which can be used to test the level of adoption of technology by undergraduate and master's students. Small but essential differences between degree levels related to intention to use DETs could be detected in the tests carried out. It was found that the perception of DETs utility influences more undergraduate students than master's students in terms of the intention to adopt digital resources. Possible explanations comprise the exclusion of other important variables in the model, which are more sensitive to students enrolled at a higher level of education, such as previous experience of using digital resources in the context of blended learning.
