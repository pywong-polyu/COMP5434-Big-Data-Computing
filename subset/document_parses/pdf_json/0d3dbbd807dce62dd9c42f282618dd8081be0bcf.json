Civil unrest, sudden restriction on access to foreign currencies, a reduction in financial ratings, and the COVID-19 pandemic have raised concerns over the livelihood of the Lebanese population (2) . In fact, the Ministry of Social Affairs estimates that the pandemic's effects on top of the economic crisis will lead to an increase by 50% in poverty and unemployment rates (3) . As such, the combined impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the economic freefall constitutes a unique and unprecedented situation, this country is facing, and imposes detrimental repercussions on people's livelihoods, food security, and health. This fast deterioration of economic conditions and COVID-19 pandemic in Lebanon, are affecting all pillars of food security including; availability, access, and utilization, which is now being further aggravated by movement restrictions, loss of income, and price inflation of food and nonfood items (4) . Given that the country relies heavily on food imports, the massive explosion that destroyed a significant part of the Port of Beirut on 4 August 2020 has worsened the food security situation (2) . The United Nations estimates that over 50% of the Lebanese population might be at risk of failing to access basic food needs (2) . This situation adds to an existing triple-burden of malnutrition in the country including hunger, micronutrient deficiencies, and an escalating burden of obesity and non-communicable diseases (NCDs), which all together negatively impact an already failing health system, leaving the population in extreme vulnerability (5) (6) (7) . The burden of NCDs in Lebanon, including cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, cancer, and chronic respiratory diseases, remains the largest component of the country's health profile with 91% of all deaths attributed to NCDs (8) . This is attributed in part to a gradual change in the national food consumption pattern, marked by an erosion of the Lebanese Mediterranean Diet and an increased predominance of the Western diets that are characterized by increased consumption of animal-derived food products that are high in energy, fat, added sugars, and salt, and a decreased intake of plant-based food, such as fruits and vegetables, ultimately leading to a decrease in the intake of dietary fibers and complex carbohydrates (9) (10) (11) (12) . In a context that operates with an already stressed food security system, further, vulnerabilities to food insecurity, malnutrition and obesity imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic and the economic freefall are expected to magnify disparities in healthy living behaviors, perpetuating a vicious synergy of complex yet preventable nutrition conditions that contribute to the exacerbation of diet-related NCDs and undernutrition (13) . Such circumstances have prodded public demand for guidance on what would constitute affordable and healthy dietary choices and food consumption recommendations to alleviate the burden to this emerging unfortunate situation.",

Therefore, the purpose of this study is to derive a healthy and sustainable diet, by defining healthy and sustainable food options, identifying changes to usual dietary practices, and suggesting feasible tradeoffs for Lebanese adults. This will be achieved by using an optimization mathematical model that generates optimal diet solutions that are healthy, of low cost and satisfy the adequate nutrient needs of adults in Lebanon taking into consideration environmental sustainability aspects. The results will provide policy makers and key stakeholders with the needed knowledge on how to mitigate the current precarious health and food insecurity situation by promoting a sustainable food consumption pattern that may be used to develop sustainable food based dietary guidelines (SFBDGs) for Lebanon that concomitantly address health, economic, and environmental sustainability dimensions.",

With regards to the calculations, a mathematical approach to compute an optimized dietary pattern for Lebanese adults, given a set of constraints and objective functions was used. Constraints were set for food items within food groups based on the World Health Organization (WHO), Mediterranean Diet (MD), and EAT-Lancet recommendations for sustainable and healthy consumption (18) (19) (20) , supported by expert opinion. Calculations were made to resemble the usual food consumption pattern in Lebanon as closely as possible. Minimum and maximum constraints for nutrients and energy were selected based on DRIs' estimated average requirements and tolerable upper intake levels (21) , and considerations with respect to environmental impact and cost were taken in accordance with the values of EFP and cost of the usual consumption pattern. The optimized dietary pattern was the pattern most similar to the usual diet (objective function). The results were used to identify and suggest food consumption changes, policy options that are sustainable, healthy, and emanate from the context of the current food situation in the country. The results and recommendations were consulted with and supported by various stakeholders, representatives from the government and the food industry and food and nutrition experts. Stakeholders meetings were conducted at different stages of the project, in order to build consensus on; (1) the constraints identified from the literature, (2) the results of the pilot test of the optimization, (3) the final results of the optimization, (4) the developed recommendations. The methodology used could be emulated in countries of the region with considerations to local socioeconomic and health situations to guide the development of sustainable diets and subsequently SFBDG.",

In the optimizations, the similarity of the two diets is defined as minimizing the sum of the squared deviations in food group quantity (grams) of the optimized diet and the consumption in the Lebanese National Food Consumption Surveys (2008/2009). This is known as quadratic programming. The method for quadratic programming can be formulated as follows (33) . where, for m nutrient constraints and n food items, the m by n matrix A consists of the nutrient contents for each food item and the vector b = b 1 , . . . , b m consists of the minimum nutrient requirements.

Note that ordinary linear programming is another mathematical technique that allows the generation of optimal solutions and is typically used in practice. However, the reasoning behind using the principle of quadratic programming here was to give preference to more food groups but less amount of changed grams per food group over a large change in one food group. For example, a preference for 10 g deviation in five food groups (sum of squared deviations = 5 \u00d7 10 2 = 500), rather than a deviation of 5 \u00d7 10 = 50 g in one food group (squared deviation = 2,500).

Expert opinion was first sought-after pilot testing the optimization, using all the constraints identified from international references. The results were disclosed with all stakeholders.

A consumption pattern in line with these recommendations reduces the risk of major chronic diseases, supplies adequate amounts of energy and nutrients, and reduces the environmental impact compared with the mean usual national consumption. A shift from the usual food consumption pattern to a food pattern that resembles the suggested healthy and sustainable diet is regarded as an integral component of food security and as key to achieving Sustainable Development Goals, which call for responsible production and consumption, to ensure food security and nutrition within sustainable food systems. This sustainability aspect is being recommended to be included as a 5th dimension of food security (34) (35) (36) . The recommended changes in food cosumption patterns for Lebanon will result in a higher consumption of whole grain bread, bulgur, fruits, vegetables, dairy products, fish, eggs, nuts, and legumes. According to the 2015 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee (DGAC), a dietary pattern that is higher in plantbased foods, such as vegetables, fruits, whole grains, legumes, nuts, and seeds, and lower in animal-based foods is more health promoting and is associated with lesser environmental impact (GHG and energy, land, and water use) (37) . Although, strong evidence highlights the need to align health and environmental objectives in dietary guidelines and recommendations, only four countries; Germany, Brazil, Sweden, and Qatar, have so far included environmental sustainability aspects in their dietary guidelines (32) . The healthy and sustainable diet, according to our model, may lead to a 22% cut in kgCO2eq and 6% reduction in water consumption compared to the usual national diet. This is in line with several studies that have suggested that vegan and vegetarian diets have the lowest GHG emissions, with up to 53% reduction compared to reference scenarios (38) . Our results also suggest that the healthy and sustainable diet is not more expensive than the usual national diet, therefore fully affordable for the population under study. This confirms other findings that a healthier and more eco-friendly diet is not necessarily more expensive (19, 39) .",

This will involve many sectors and should have a focus of long-term achievements and development of economically, politically, technically and environmentally robust systems, taking into consideration consumer preferences. Policymakers know that consumer behavior change would be central to any policy process aiming at integrating nutrition and sustainability (53) . As such the findings of this study may help policymakers understand potential benefits of tradeoffs for promoting such diets and make investment choices while taking action to address any potential negative consequence. The findings of this study are not to facilitate \"policy drift\" to focus on lifestyle choices, but rather to provide a framework to support cross-sectoral food and health policy discussions, particularly in relation to dietary guidelines in Lebanon. An important element to be considered in policy recommendations related to food consumption is the taste costs of the shifts in dietary intakes. The latter has been defined as the 'utility loss induced by a dietary change that brings a new balance between long-term health goals and short-term pleasure and hedonic rewards' (54) . Therefore, investigating the willingness and readiness of the Lebanese population to adapt the proposed shifts toward healthy and sustainable diets is an integral step toward the successful development and implementation of any policy recommendations.",

            "text": "Shifting national food consumption patterns to promote human health, and at the same time controlling cost and mitigating environmental impact, represents an obvious \"win-win\" future scenario. The optimized diet suggested in this study highlights the need to increase the intakes of; whole grain bread, dark green vegetables, dairy products, and legumes, and lower intakes of; refined grain bread, meat, poultry, added sugars, saturated fat, as compared to usual national mean consumption. This diet will result in a decrease in the associated EFPs, keeping the cost constant and satisfying all necessary nutritional needs for adults. Findings highlight the need for the development of sustainable food based dietary guidelines for Lebanon to promote diets that are healthy, sustainable, culturally acceptable, and affordable and that can alleviate food insecurity among the general population. It further pushes the agenda of the Water-Energy-Food-Health Nexus forward as it proposes an opportunity for efficient resource use and reduced environmental impact all along the food supply chain to food consumption. As such, a successful transition to healthy and more sustainable dietary patterns would require concerted actions by many key stakeholders, and a diverse set of policy actions to encourage the adoption of the recommended changes across the food system. Such policy recommendations included integrating the healthy and sustainable dietary shifts into a national food security plan using a food system approach and subsidizing the proposed healthy and affordable dietary options. A few limitations ought to be considered in the interpretation of the findings of this study. The data used for usual intake dated back to 2009. However, these data come from the most recent national food consumption survey, given that, since that date, no such national surveys have been conducted. More recent studies on population subgroups in Lebanon showed that dietary intake seemed to continue to shift toward a more Western type of diet with a concomitant erosion of the traditional Lebanese diet (55) (56) (57) . There are other limitations to the present study, which partially relate to the general limitations associated with using 24 h recalls to measure dietary consumption. Twenty-four hour recalls may be associated with measurement error due to inaccuracies in estimating frequencies and determination of pre-quantified food items and food portion sizes (58) . Furthermore, the use of Nutritionist pro software to calculate estimations of food and nutrient intake may pose some limitations, since many factors render databases limited in terms of local applicability. Thus, it should be recognized that some degree of bias on a survey's outcome related to food variations among countries could possibly occur (59) . It is also important to note that, the estimation of the EFPs required the reliance on LCAs conducted in other countries because of the absence of data in Lebanon. However, every effort was exerted to identify LCAs within neighboring countries in the MENA region, or, otherwise, use LCAs from other countries that have comparable climate and environmental conditions to Lebanon. The findings of these studies together with the increasingly dwindling environmental resources in the country further underscore the importance of the findings of this study. That said, the regular conduct of a national food-consumption survey is warranted to provide updated information on various aspects of dietary intake in Lebanon.",
