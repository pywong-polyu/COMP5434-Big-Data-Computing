Unfortunately, better performing tests are sometimes costlier and time consuming and can only be done for a small fraction of the population. On the other hand, greater number of individuals can be tested using a cheaper, rapid test, but may only provide less reliable results. In this work, we studied the interplay between cost and delay of the tests as well the additional advantages offered by partial and complete lockdowns. To understand the influence of different test strategies, we implemented them on realistic random social networks with a COVID-19-like epidemic in progression. Specifically, we compared the performance of two tests mimicking the characteristics of popular tests implemented for COVID-19 detection. We present procedures and intuitive understanding to ascertain the optimum combination of the tests to minimize the peak infection as well as total quarantine days when the number of tests is constrained by a fixed total budget.",

The initial studies suspect that the asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic infections can be as high as 81% [8] . This makes large scale testing crucial, along with NPIs.

This total ignorance makes all the individuals in the network to be equally likely to be infectious whereas only an unknown number of random individuals are infectious.

It also provides a system of differential equations onto which the effects of stochasticity are added. A more realistic model is developed by adding delay and stochasticity -both in transitions of individuals between compartments and in the results of the tests. The characteristics of real offline social network is implemented by creating networks based on a preferential attachment algorithm. The dynamics of test-based quarantining and restrictions in human interactions are studied by modulating the links between the nodes in the network. We consider two tests, one with high performance but with larger cost and slower turn-around times and the other which is rapid and cheap but with lower performance (reliability).

This can be seen in the variation of \u0305 as a function of 1 as in the few example plots given in Section 2 of SI. In short, a cheaper test is preferred over a costlier test if the cost of the cheaper test is lower than its reduced performance (true positive probability). These results are valid in a normally unrestricted society, i.e., a society where the individuals maintain their social physical contacts as usual, unless they are quarantined or isolated. This assumption of an unrestrictive society makes the untested population, essentially equivalent to the ones who are tested and found to be uninfectious. Thus, for the goodness of the society, a greater number of true positives must be isolated irrespective of the number of false negatives.",

Hence, these comparisons are independent of the factors such as prevalence of the infection or quarantining. The impacts of these factors are not straight forward either. For instance, let us qualitatively consider the impact of quarantining. Despite the economic liability, quarantining of a true positive is preferred. However, the impact of quarantining of a false positive is not intuitive or even identical at different prevalence of the infection. On an individual level, a falsely quarantined individual isolates himself from the general population, thereby preventing himself from getting infectious. On the other hand, a false quarantine increases the density of infectious cases in the freely moving population and thereby enhance the disease spread. In any case, false quarantining always brings out unwarranted economic burden. Hence, to obtain a more realistic impact of test performance on the peak infection and total quarantines, a network model with stochasticity incorporated into the testing and epidemic spread is used.",

To study the propagation of epidemics and the influence of testing procedures as in real-world scenarios, network models are used [17] . These models avoid the assumptions such as homogeneous mixing. In addition, transmission of diseases, as well as testing can be modelled as stochastic events around their average characteristic parameters. In addition, in a network model, the spread of the disease depends on the number and pattern of contact among the individuals. Hence, the effects of social restrictions along with the random testing procedures can be studied by varying the average contacts between the individuals. By properly modelling the intervention procedures, they can be tested in these networks and thus bring out results that are closer to practical scenario. For instance, the events such as super-spreading will be inherently included in the model as a direct consequence of a highly connected infected node being not quarantined. These nodes directly infect a disproportionately large number of people and are pivotal during the early stages of the outbreak [18] . Similar direct and indirect consequences will be realistically mimicked in these simulations than in the deterministic model.",

In order to faithfully compare performances of different test procedures, testing and quarantining must be avoided after the elimination of epidemic from the network. In real scenarios, we cannot be certain of this complete elimination within a short time duration and the epidemic could still reemerge from a few of the remaining unquarantined infected individuals. In such cases, the testing and quarantining must be restarted. In simulations, we established this using two thresholds based on the actual infections in the network. The first threshold ( 1 ) determines the minimum number of infections in the network for the testing-quarantining procedure to begin or restart. Similarly, once the number of infections in the network is below the second threshold ( 2 ), the testings will be stopped. The thresholds were set to be 1% and 0.5% which implies that the testing begins when the number of infectious cases in the 1000-node network is above 10 and stops when it is below 5.",

It shows the results from 4 different time instances during the progression of the epidemic. Each of the nodes (colored circles) indicate an individual and the lines indicate their interconnections. Note that the nodes could be susceptible (yellow), infected (red) or recovered (green) and their sizes are proportional to the number of connections. Figure 3(a) shows the initial condition. Figure 3(b) shows the network at the maximum prevalence of the epidemic with 10 nodes infected, 11 nodes susceptible and none recovered. Note that the nodes 3, 8, 10, 11, 12 and 14 are correctly quarantined whereas the nodes 15 and 18 are wrongly quarantined. Despite being susceptible, these nodes are quarantined due to false positives arising from the tests. Nodes 1, 5, 9 and 17 are not quarantined despite being infected. This could either be because they were not selected for the random tests or were reported to be (falsely) negative. Similarly, all the remaining nodes (0, 2, 4, 6, 7, 13, 16, 19 and 20) were either not tested or were tested and found to be negative. Figure 3 (c) shows the situation nearing the end of the epidemic spread. Here nodes 3, 9 and 11 are recovered and are falsely quarantined. This could be due to the fixed-duration quarantine policy in our system where the infection ends typically in 8 or 9 days and the quarantine length is fixed to be 10 days. On the other hand, these could be the results of false positives. Figure 3(d) shows the network, immediately after the end of the epidemic. The actual simulations were done on 1000-node networks for a duration of 100 days. The output of each simulation has two kinds of results -the ground realities which cannot be known with certainty in real scenarios and the inferred results which are completely known. The results from the epidemic progression such as the number of susceptible, infected, and recovered as well as the classification of test results into number of true positives, false negatives, true negatives, and false positives are all ground realities which cannot be detected with certainty in real scenarios. On the other hand, the inferred quantities such as positive and negative test results are completely discernable in practice. In our simulations, both the ground realities as well as the test results could be stored and analyzed. In fact, in the later section we infer the goodness of a testing strategy based on a ground reality -peak infection -as well as on an inferred quantity -total quarantine days. Figure 4 shows the simulation results of a 1000-node network with network, epidemic and simulation parameters as explained earlier (tabulated in Section 6 of SI). Additionally, each day, 67 of the unquarantined nodes are selected at random and are tested with RTPCR-like test ( 1 = 0.067).",

This is because delays expediates the infection as well as the disease-free equilibria in the network. As the tests are performed only when the number of infections in the network is within the threshold, this expediated disease-free equilibrium reduces the total number of tests and hence reduces the number of total quarantine days. 2. In terms of disease-control, rapid tests outperform hypothetical RTPCR tests which are delayfree. The red and blue shaded region represents the peak infection and total quarantine days, respectively, when only rapid-tests are employed in the network. Surprisingly, even with the same number of daily tests, less sensitive rapid tests were able to control the peak infection better than ideal delay-free RTPCR. The reason for this is the increased quarantining of the susceptible due the increased false positive probability of rapid test ( 2 = 0.1), compared to that of RTPCR ( 1 = 0.01).

This is primarily because, though the rapid tests can detect only a fewer true positive ( 2 = 0.8) compared to RTPCR tests ( 1 = 0.98), it quarantines many more of the false positives ( 2 = 0.1 1 = 0.01). It is directly evident from m=1 curve in Figure 7 (b) where the total quarantine days is larger (\u03a3 \u2248 4200) when there are only rapid tests ( 1 = 0), compared to a situation when there are only RTPCR tests (\u03a3 \u2248 2800 at 1 = 0.1).",

If we overlook the increased quarantine and its associated economic implications, these measures can reduce the infection rate and peak infection. Thus, solely in terms of disease-control, a test which misidentifies susceptible to be infectious is preferred. This result points to the significance of selfisolation or reverse quarantining for reducing the peak infection. Another reason for the rapid tests to outperform RTPCR at m=1 is the one-day result turn-around delay of the RTPCR tests. But from Figure 6 (a), it is apparent that even with 0-day delay for RTPCR, the peak infection averages only around 230, if only RTPCR tests are used ( 1 = 0.1). This implies that the removal of the one-day delay in RTPCR test can reduce the amplitude, but cannot change the sign of the average slope of m=1 curve in Figure 7 (a). Even the degraded test 2, which has its sensitivity among the least of the practical diagnostic tests ( \u2032 2 = 0.50), performs similarly to the normal rapid tests in terms of disease control.",
