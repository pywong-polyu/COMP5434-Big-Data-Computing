Drive-through pickup at community pharmacies delivers a significant increase in convenience, patient satisfaction, and access to care to prescription medications. 1 Drive-in influenza vaccination sites have also expanded access and increased the number of individuals vaccinated. [2] [3] [4] Drive-through and drive-in services proved to have an even more significant role in the current severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the COVID-19 pandemic as a means to provide a variety of health services while maintaining physical distancing, thereby reducing exposure risk for patients at increased risk, providing ease of care for patients with mobility issues, and reducing the use of sometimes scarce personal protective equipment. Moreover, drive-in or drive-through services can nicely compliment telemedicine encounters, where services and procedures requiring a physical presence are still needed, such as diagnostic testing (eg, cancer screening) and vaccinations (eg, influenza, childhood vaccinations). Without such an option, clinical care using telemedicine approaches may actually have the unintended consequence of reducing the delivery of indicated services. For example, 1 healthcare utilization survey identified a drop in consumer spending on healthcare of approximately 38% across many sectors of the market during the early part of the coronavirus pandemic. 5 At least some part of this reduced spending represents a reduction in indicated and important clinical services. For example, from June 2019 to June 2020, cancer screenings were down for breast cancer (94%), colon cancer (86%), and cervical 2 Health Services Insights cancer (84%) for 2020 compared to a 3-year period from 2017 to 2019. Additionally, childhood vaccination rates declined 21.5% between January and April 2020 accompanying the reduced ability for patients to access care at a typical clinical visit. 6 As COVID-19 vaccines have received emergency use authorization and have been disseminated for vaccination, there has been a large focus on identifying processes to safely, efficiently, and effectively vaccinate large populations as a means to achieve both individual and herd immunity. [7] [8] [9] [10] In this technical paper, we outline and describe the successful evaluation and adaptation of a drive-in approach, along with iterative process and physical structure improvements, using an existing parking garage near a campus of outpatient clinics to serve as a site of SARS-CoV-2 testing, administration of routine vaccinations, and ultimately the administration of COVID-19 vaccines that may serve as a template for other sites to adapt.",

The COVID-19 Vaccination Site was informed by the development and operationalization of a (1) drive-in COVID-19 nasopharyngeal testing site and (2) a drive-in respiratory vaccination site in the same parking garage. Briefly, we operationalized a drive-in COVID-19 nasopharyngeal testing site, which conducted over 18 000 tests by August 2020 (Supplemental Appendix 2). Through this process we gained protection from the elements, expanded Wi-Fi services to utilize the electronic health record (EHR) in real-time, created a rotating schedule among clinics to share the staffing burden, and expanded communication with the hospital to ensure adequate supplies. Next, we expanded the drive-in approach to incorporate respiratory (influenza and pneumococcal) vaccinations to be administered within the site (Supplemental Appendix 3). We performed 124 vaccinations and received very positive patient-reported feedback from 29 patients. This process provided a framework to expand our EHR capabilities to create scheduling slots in which patients can self-schedule.",

First, healthcare workers deemed high risk were encouraged to sign up for EHR application in advance to reduce the number who needed to be scheduled over the phone, thus emulating the process used for the respiratory vaccines. Standardized templates were developed to schedule patients for follow-up vaccinations within each of the vaccine's follow-up parameters to help prevent scheduling errors. Using Plan-Do-Study-Act processes, we created a systematic workflow from check-in through departure to maximize the use of available personnel. Moving the vaccine prep site to the garage from the clinic space, pairing vaccinators with schedulers, and creating a systematic parking flow were the most impactful changes made throughout the initial process.",

During a day with maximal capacity, our staff requirements included: 1 operations lead, 2 clinical leads, 7 vaccinators, 7 schedulers, 2 check-in staff, 3 traffic controllers, 6 observers, 2 vaccine drawers, 2 documenters (staff to document within the EHR), and 1 pharmacist.

Similar to the processes for COVID-19 testing and respiratory vaccine administration (Supplemental Figure 5 ), patients would arrive at the check-in tent and have a placard placed on their windshield, indicating they were to receive a COVID-19 vaccine (as opposed to one of the other services offered at the garage), along with a CDC COVID-19 vaccine card. The patient would then be directed by traffic control to a parking spot and told to turn off their engine. Vehicles were parked in every other spot to ensure adequate space between vehicles for vaccinators and schedulers to work. A scheduler would approach the patient's vehicle and again confirm the patient's identity and schedule them for their second dose vaccine appointment. Next, a vaccinator would approach the vehicle with a vaccine cart and administer the vaccine while the patient remained in their vehicle. The vaccinator would inform the patient of potential adverse events to monitor for and notify the patient to honk their horn if any allergy-related adverse events occurred. The vaccinator would then place a sticky note on the vehicle with the time of vaccination, as well as the time of expiration of the 15-or 30-minute observation period. Observers would walk around the garage and check on patients by verbally communicating with them to make sure they were fine. Once the observation time period elapsed, the observer would make 1 final check and, if the patient had no adverse reactions, allow the patient to pull through and exit the parking garage. After the observation time was completed, the documenter was prompted to note the vaccine administration and any adverse events (if necessary) into the system. The EHR would then automatically submit the vaccination record to the state department of health.",

At this time, the parking garage site only utilized Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine for first doses, while the first doses of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine were administered at the hospital location. Patients scheduled to receive their second dose of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine at the parking garage site were called and either rescheduled to the hospital location (if it was convenient) or scheduled to the parking garage site (separated into 1 of 5 days to minimize the complexity of administering both COVID vaccines in the garage site). The first 2 days (1/6/21 and 1/8/21) were demarcated in whether the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine would be given in the morning. After a brief time-out, the garage site was transitioned to administering Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine only. However, this process underutilized available vaccine and vaccinators. The following week (1/11/21, 1/13/21, and 1/14/21), both first Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine doses and second Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine doses could be given during the same time.

This revised process allowed us to maximize the number of vaccines while minimizing the risk for errors.

Having access to a battery charger and/or jumper cables on-site therefore became extremely handy. Additionally, a laptop charging station was purchased, which minimized the need to transport laptops back to the clinic each night to charge. We also created a streamlined process for converting from 1 vaccine lot number to the next to assist with accurate documentation of what vaccine was given. Here, a new lot was prepped by a second vaccine drawer and sequestered away from the other doses. Once all old lot vaccines were on the vaccinators' carts, the new lot of vaccine was brought out with new lot stickers and red stickers. The red stickers would be placed on the face sheet after vaccination to signal to the documenters which lot was being documented. This helped prevent work stoppages, which were initially required when switching lots. Finally, Google Sheets was utilized to schedule leadership slots and staff member slots. This document was evaluated to assess the number of slots occupied by vaccine recipients to ensure that the number of staff members were sufficient. It was monitored by administration daily to ensure adequate staffing each day. Additionally, an email address was created so staff could email if they needed to cancel a shift. This email box was checked daily to update the Google document and obtain additional staff when necessary.",

There were many advantages to this approach, as noted, including the ability to provide care to patients receiving a vaccination in the convenience of their vehicle. Although the optimal approach used may be dictated by weather, population density, and access to a health system, we found a number of benefits to the drive-through approach. Patients with mobility issues or disability can remain in their vehicle, helping mitigate the added stress of walking through a new space and receiving the vaccination. Patients with compromised immune function and others focused on riskavoidance may also benefit from this approach as it avoids the clinical (indoor) setting and minimizes contact with people outside of ones' own bubble. The use of the enclosed garage also offered flexible protection from the weather, a place to apply airconditioning in the summer, heat in the winter, and a rain covering in all seasons. Moreover, the drive-in approach may also be useful in concert with telemedicine visits as a means to provide access to non-COVID-19 services and procedures (eg, diagnostic screening and vaccinations).",

Asgary et al. 1 developed a simulation tool to assist in the development and operationalization of drive-through mass vaccination facilities most commonly utilized in large, densely populated urban areas. This tool allows users to estimate volume of vaccination and staff needed to run such facilities efficiently under different configurations. In the base case analysis, where 10 lanes with 4 staff members per lane, 3 shifts per day, and multiple passengers in 1 car are allowed, a total of 1771 cars used the drive-through with an average time spent between 80 and 90 minutes under 100% pre-registration. The layout of the setups for the tool consists of a screening booth, registration stations, vaccination stations, and recovery area. 1 This layout differs from the set-up of our site, which did not separate vaccination and recovery sites (ie, patients were not required to drive immediately after vaccination) especially since immediate vasovagal dizziness is a known adverse event. Additionally, this site does not allow for overhead coverage and therefore may be impacted by weather both in temperature and precipitation. Asgary's stimulation tool aimed to assess the drive-through approach for a mass vaccination provides hypothetical guidance based on several inputs like amount of vaccine available, staff requirements, and physical size of the site; however, our description provides further guidance on \"how-to\" develop operationalize a vaccination site within a parking garage.",

This site completed a total of 2174 vaccinations resulting in a median process time was 5 minutes per vehicle, 3 minutes per vaccination. 4 Our rate of vaccination (60 per hour) may be difficult to directly compare to a site delivering influenza vaccine as it does not require a 15-minute observation period as does the COVID-19 vaccination.
