            "text": "During the coronavirus pandemic in the UK, attention increasingly focused on the death rate of elderly and disabled residents in care homes, as well as the staff. On 29 April, 2020, the news came that deaths the previous week in these institutions -far more dispersed and numerous than those of the NHS -had exceeded those in the latter's hospitals. Although it had been clear from the first stages of the pandemic that older people with established preconditions were far more vulnerable to its impact than young, physically fit people, it was shocking that those who could do nothing to safeguard themselves through isolation were supplying the virus with concentrations of easy victims in this way. Furthermore, the high proportions of Black, Asian and minority ethnic staff in these homes, and their lack of personal protective equipment, made them doubly vulnerable to the virus.",

            "text": "There were many reasons why this situation had been allowed to develop. Perhaps the most fundamental was that the historical mode of care for those older people who survived past pandemics and the hazards of working life involved women's roles in extended family households. For instance, at the time of the Spanish Flu of 1919, women's participation rate was around 35 per cent, and during the peace that followed until 1939 it remained roughly stable. Overall, service jobs (including domestic service, which made up around a third of their employment) grew by 33 per cent, as manufacturing work, mainly by men, fell by 3 per cent between 1920 and 1938 (Feinstein 1976, Table 59, p. 129) . Women played a crucial role during the Second World War, but then resumed household roles in large numbers when peace came. In the 1960s, they were catching up with developments in Sweden, but ahead of those in Germany; between 1951 and 2018, the total figures for economically active women increased from seven to over 15 million (Office for National Statistics, Labour Force Survey, 2019).",

The political parties were slow to recognise that, as life expectancy increased, women were bearing the heaviest burdens, as carers for their parents as well as their children, in addition to their roles as contributors to household earnings. In Britain in 1983, 5 per cent of all men and 15 per cent of all women over 80 were being looked after in their children's households (OPCS, General Household Survey, 1983, Table 3.7, p. 15 ). But the supply of family carers was declining; at that time it was already forecast that the average couple in their 80s, which had 40 surviving female relatives, would have only 11 when reaching that age in 2000 (Ermisch 1983, p. 283) .",

But also because of the low status of work in care homes, and the fact that most of the electorate had little contact with this sector except at the end of their elders' lives, the issue did not command much priority.

The home stopped responding to relatives' telephone calls on 17 March, when the national lock-down had just started, by which time 46 were dead.

By then some 65 residents had symptoms of the virus, as attention of politicians and the media focused on hospitals; care staff and residents in homes lacked PPE. The virus was rumoured to have come to Spain through a man who had been skiing in the Alps, and the delay in publicity about the plight of care home staff and residents (in contrast to hospital patients) was attributed to the insecurity of the non-unionised status of the former workers and the power of private home-owners (BBC Radio 4, 'Crossing Continents', 'Spain's Care Home Nightmare', presented by Linda Presley, 30 April).",

This may reflect the fact that their citizenship status and rights are the least contested in the age groups. Retirement pensions -historically the first to be granted in liberal democracies, and the least conditional -have tended to be more generous than benefits for other age groups, as well as largely unconditional. If media stereotypes of older people are often insultingly patronising, at least they do not present them as dangerous deviants. The popular press and TV channels are constantly on the look-out for old people who -like the Second World War veteran Captain Tom Moore -are courageously battling ill-health to perform unlikely feats such as walking for many miles to raise money for charities, even on their hundredth birthday (BBC Radio 4, 'Today', 30 April, 2020).",

Furthermore, and of even more concern in many ways, it became clear in mid-May that the NHS had looked after its own professional and institutional interests at the expense of the care system. By the second week of April, 40 per cent of deaths in England had been in care homes. Advice had been given by government, which remained uncontradicted between mid-February and mid-March, that there was no risk of a coronavirus outbreak in care homes, in spite of warnings in previous years to local authorities that the sector was vulnerable to such infections; the new evidence was that 10,000 more deaths than in previous years occurred during this month.

Suddenly, being in a care home meant exposure to the highest risk to health and life itself, with the onset of the pandemic. Furthermore, hospitals now had incentives to discharge such patients as fast as possible, to keep their own rates of infection from Covid-19 down. This added to the vulnerability of the residents of care homes.",

There continued to be thousands of dispersed care homes, owned by private firms, many with only a few establishments; they were underfunded, and some were understaffed. As the hospitals filled up with victims of the pandemic, there was soon a drastic shortage of places for those older patients cured of it to be discharged for the further care they needed. There is now evidence that patients (both those with other conditions and those who had been suffering with coronavirus symptoms) were discharged to care homes before they had been adequately tested (BBC Radio 4, 'PM', 13 May, 2020). Soon deaths in care homes exceeded those in hospitals; the number of deaths in care homes from mid-April to early May was three times the average number of previous years, while those in hospitals were lower than the average for that time of year (ibid.).",
