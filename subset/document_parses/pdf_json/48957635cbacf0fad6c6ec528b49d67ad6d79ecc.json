Hong Kong (China) reported the first confirmed COVID-19 patient on 22 January 2020 [3] , and then gradually the number of confirmed cases increased. The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the outbreak to be a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) on 30 January 2020 [4] . During the early stage of the COVID-19 outbreak, the number of infected cases continued to grow. Some problems emerged including the absence of a public health emergency response system for making contingency plan and for coordinating the anti-epidemic response action; and lack of adequate manpower (such as nurses and doctors with critical care experiences) & resources (such as masks, personal protective equipment, & ventilators). The situation continued to get worse, COVID-19 continued to spread from continent to continent, and finally WHO officially declared the COVID-19 outbreak as a pandemic on 11 March 2020 [5] .",

Disaster is defined as a serious disruption of the functioning of a community or a society causing widespread human, material, economic or environmental losses which exceed the ability of the affected community or society to cope using its own resources. Also, such event overwhelms local medical capacity and requires a request to the national or international level for external assistance [6] . Disaster can be classified as a natural and man-made disaster, and natural disaster can further be subdivided into 5 subgroups [7] as: geophysical (e.g. earthquake); meteorological (e.g. storm); hydrological (e.g. flood); climatological (e.g. heatwave) and biological (e.g. epidemic). Here, it is shown that epidemic belongs to a biological disaster, and therefore epidemic can be better managed from a perspective of disaster management.",

Although the nature of the disaster and the format of management differ, however, the concept and approach of management are similar. According to WHO, the disaster management cycle has four components, which include mitigation (reducing risk); preparedness (providing training and drills); response (carrying out medical rescue), and recovery (restoring and reconstructing physical, psychological, and social health) [8] . To manage a biological disaster or epidemic more properly and effectively, the healthcare system should reduce the disaster risk before it happens (mitigation); equip the healthcare team and public adequately before the epidemic outbreak occurs (preparedness); dispatch a public health emergency response team to control and treat the infection (response); and facilitate those infected patients and infected healthcare workers (HCWs) to recover physically, psychologically and socially. Let us take a look at the current COVID-19 pandemic situation, and discuss how epidemic/pandemic can be better managed from a perspective of disaster management.",

There is an urgent need to set up a public health emergency response system or network in every country/region to coordinate all anti-epidemic activities before and after an outbreak occurs. Such a system can provide an anti-epidemic plan, arrange adequate manpower and resources, and coordinate the overall anti-epidemic activities including screening and quarantine services and suggesting different treatment modalities for managing infected patients. This allows better triaging and stabilizing the suspected COVID-19 patients, as well as providing definitive treatment to the confirmed COVID-19 patients. The system can also alert the local medical system about the scale of the outbreak, and estimate the coping capacity of the community so that the local government can have better planning to manage the outbreak. If such a system or network was in place before the outbreak, the initial emergency response would have been done in a much organized and effective manner in many countries/regions, and the epidemic could have been controlled in a better manner.",

When such disaster comes, it is so powerful that we can neither withstand nor resist, but we can learn to respond in order to reduce the number of infected cases and deaths. To better prepare for managing an epidemic, one should utilize the framework of a disaster management cycle by: reducing the disaster risk (mitigation); providing adequate preparation to both healthcare teams and public (preparedness); dispatching healthcare team to the forefront to combat the infection (response); and facilitating infected patients to recover physically, psychologically and socially (recovery). To conclude, the initial success of this current anti-epidemic response on COVID-19 in many countries was not only related to the effort of the central government (in many countries) in mobilizing resources to the forefront, but actually the initial success is related to the fact that the healthcare team (including nurses and doctors) is a very good team with passion, dedication and hardworking. HCWs in every country/region are willing to contribute their love and effort in making the success of combating this novel coronavirus. The war between human beings and these coronaviruses still continue, healthcare professionals should use a proactive approach by making use of the concept of disaster management cycle to develop strategies to continue combating these coronaviruses, and one day we might have a higher chance to completely win this battle.",
