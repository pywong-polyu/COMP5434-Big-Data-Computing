Currently, there are limited epidemiological and clinical data on COVID-19 patients from low and middle-income countries. We conducted a retrospective singlecenter study of the first 100 individuals with suspected COVID-19 (between Jan. 25 and Mar. 29, 2020) admitted to San Lazaro Hospital (SLH), the national infectious diseases referral hospital in Manila, Philippines. Results: Demographic data, travel history, clinical features, and outcomes were summarized and compared between COVID-19 confirmed and non-confirmed cases. The first two confirmed cases were Chinese nationals, admitted on Jan. 25. The third confirmed case was a Filipino, admitted on Mar. 8. Trends toward confirmed COVID-19 cases not reporting international travel and being admitted to SLH from the densely populated area of Manila city were observed during Mar. 8-29. All 42 of the 100 confirmed COVID-19 cases were adults, 40% were aged 60 years and above and 55% were male. Three were health workers. Among individuals with suspected COVID-19, confirmed cases were more likely to be older, Filipino, not report international travel history and have at least one underlying disease, particularly diabetes, report difficulty in breathing, and a longer duration of symptoms. In over 90% of non-COVID-19 cases, the alternative diagnosis was respiratory. Nine (21%) confirmed cases died. The median duration from symptoms onset to death was 11.5 (range: 8-18) days. Conclusions: Imported COVID-19 cases have reduced but local transmission persists and there is a trend toward cases being admitted to SLH from densely populated areas. This study highlights the difficulty in diagnosing COVID-19 on clinical grounds and the importance of diagnostic capacity in all settings. Difficulty of breathing was the only symptom associated with COVID-19 infection and should alert clinicians to the possibility of COVID-19.

Some temporal and geographic trends can be observed, with regards to suspected and confirmed infections at SLH. The first two suspected COVID-19 cases admitted to SLH on Jan. 25, 2020, were Chinese nationals on vacation from Wuhan, becoming the first confirmed COVID-19 cases in the Philippines [6] . The Philippine government implemented travel restrictions on foreign travelers from Hubei province on Jan. 31, and then extended this to include additional countries with COVID-19 cases during February [7, 8] . The DOH conducted contact tracing on all the confirmed cases and released an interim guideline for contact tracing for confirmed COVID-19 cases on February 5, 2020 [20] . The absence of further confirmed cases among foreign nationals suggests that these measures were effective. The third confirmed case was admitted on Mar. 8, more than a month after the first case. No epidemiological link was found between the third case and the first two cases. The third, fourth, and fifth cases all reported a history of international travel. The case admitted on Mar. 10 was the first case suggestive of local transmission. On Mar. 12, the Philippine government expanded the travel ban to visitors from all 65 estimated countries with local transmission [9] . Trends toward confirmed COVID-19 cases not reporting international travel (Fig. 1) and being admitted from the populous area of Manila city rather than other areas (Fig. 2) were observed during Mar. . While only from one hospital, this data suggests the COVID-19 epidemic may have reached Manila city during this time period, as it is likely that symptomatic individuals would have attended SLH rather than another hospital. Increased COVID-19 infections in Manila city are of concern; given it is the most densely populated city in Metro Manila, with 71,263 persons per square kilometer [21] . Small dwelling sizes, social mixing due to extended families, overcrowding in slums, poses a high risk of community transmission and large outbreak in the absence of public health interventions. In order to suppress and mitigate transmission in the Philippines, the government has implemented contract tracing and surveillance, triage systems, increased testing, and improved case management. Enhanced community quarantine has been in place in Luzon island since Mar. 17, 2020 [19] . The effect of these interventions on community transmission and number of severe COVID-19 cases in the context of relatively young population in a tropical climate needs to be carefully assessed. The factors we report to be associated with COVID-19 confirmed cases among suspected cases should be interpreted with caution.
