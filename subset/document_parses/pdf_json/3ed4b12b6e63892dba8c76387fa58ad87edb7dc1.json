In this retrospective cohort study using deidentified administrative claims for Medicare Advantage and commercially insured individuals in a research database we examine over 3.5 million fully vaccinated individuals, including 8,848 individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection, with a follow-up period between 14 and 151 days after their second dose. Our primary outcome was the rate of Covid-19 infection occurring at 30, 60, and 90 days at least 14 days after the second dose of either the mRNA-1273 vaccine or the BNT162b2 vaccine. Sub-analyses included the incidence of hospitalization, ICU admission, and death/hospice transfer. Separate analysis was conducted for individuals above and below age 65 and those without a prior diagnosis of Covid-19. We show that immunization with mRNA-1273, compared to BNT162b2, provides slightly more protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection that reaches statistical significance at 90 days with a number needed to vaccinate of >290. There are no differences in vaccine effectiveness for protection against hospitalization, ICU admission, or death/hospice transfer (aOR 1.23, 95% CI (0.67, 2.25)).",

There are no statistically significant differences between the predicted probabilities of the two vaccines ( Fig. 2B , D) for the composite outcome of hospitalization, ICU admission, death, or transfer to hospice. Adjusted odds ratios for likelihood of infection 30, 60, and 90 days post vaccination (14 days after the second dose) show that the mRNA-1273 vaccine is associated with lower odds of infection. For the unadjusted model with IPTW as sampling weights, the NNV to observe this difference ranges from 1,047 over 30 days to 290 over 90 days (Fig. 3) , signaling superior mRNA-1273 vaccine effects over time in reducing the likelihood of infection. This difference is consistent across all the models considered. However, for severe adverse outcomes (ICU admission, composite ICU admission/death/referral to hospice, or composite hospitalization/ICU admission/death/referral to hospice), while events are rare, no statistically significant differences between the two vaccines were observed ( Fig. S4-6 ). As shown in Fig. 4 , time-to-event analysis assuming right censoring, was performed and provided similar results to the binary outcome results for different model specifications, including for outcomes of infection (aHR 0.69, 95% CI (0.66, 0.72)), composite ICU admission/death/referral to hospice (aHR 0.76, 95% CI (0.50, 1.16)), and composite hospitalization/ICU admission/death/referral to hospice (aHR 0.67, 95% CI (0.51, 0.89)).

These data underscore the need to understand the comparative effectiveness of the available vaccines. Two important questions must be answered to address the comparative effectiveness of the BNT162b and mRNA-1273 vaccines. The first is whether each vaccine is equivalent in its ability to prevent severe disease from Covid-19. The data available from our large population of patients suggest that at 90 days out from vaccination, there is no significant difference between BNT162b and mRNA-1273 in terms of the risk of the composite outcome of hospitalization, ICU admission, or death/transfer to hospice (aOR [95% confidence interval]: 1. Delta infection was of very low prevalence when these data were collected, and therefore unlikely affected our comparative effectiveness results. However, as new VOCs emerge, each of these may have unique characteristics that would impact their ability to evade vaccine-induced immunity. Periodic updates to this analysis will allow us to track the comparative effectiveness of mRNA-1273 and BNT162B in the setting of the emergence of new VOCs, including Delta and Omicron.",

First, the analysis is restricted to commercially insured and Medicare Advantage beneficiaries from a single U.S. insurer, a group that is unevenly distributed across the United States geographically and demographically. Nevertheless, this study reflects a large and comprehensive sample of U.S. vaccinations. Second, we are unable to measure SARS-CoV-2 infection that is not apparent in medical claims or via laboratory testing, which likely results in an overestimate of the vaccines' protective effects. This includes the fact that our \"time-to-infection\" represents date of infection from our data (positive PCR test, or ICD-10 code of U07.1 in claims), rather than the date on which SARS-CoV-2 was contracted. Notably, asymptomatic or mild disease for which an individual did not seek care are not captured. However, serious adverse events, which pose the most strain on the healthcare system and for individuals, are reliably observable in our data and are less affected by diagnosis-dependent biases over time. Finally, we do not include an analysis accounting for calendar time as a proxy to infer the likely variant of infection as this additional confounder would further complicate already-nuanced results. While not undertaken here, further study to understand the relative effectiveness against all variants of concern is needed and will be conducted when our data on infection with Delta and Omicron are more complete. Basic counts are included in Table S8 . This study also has strengths. It represents a geographically and sociodemographically diverse group of 3,966,004 patients, allowing confidence in the estimation of individual-level patient factors associated with documented breakthrough SARS-CoV-2 infection and the resulting serious adverse events.",

To mitigate any potential selection bias, sample propensity scores, signaling conditional probability of receiving mRNA-1273 and BNT162b2, were estimated via multivariable generalized linear model with logit link function and inverse probability of treatment weights (IPTWs) were calculated using stabilization 5, 6 .

We analyzed data both from a binary and time-to-event outcome point of view, each quantifying the association between patient outcomes and vaccine types with different model specifications. Conclusions remain similar, irrespective of modeling framework, highlighting the robustness of our methods. The second question is whether there is a higher incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infections with the BNT162b vaccine compared with the mRNA-1273 vaccine, and here there is a statistically significant difference in favor of the mRNA-1273 vaccine. This difference appears very early post vaccination and increases over time. The NNV with the mRNA-1273 vaccine compared with the BNT162b vaccine to prevent one case of SARS-CoV-2 is 1047 at thirty days post vaccination (aOR [95% CI]: 0.67 [0.63, 0.71]), but is 290 at ninety days post vaccination (aOR [95% CI]: 0.66 [0.60, 0.73]). Although this incremental risk is small at the individual level, it is meaningful at the population level. Our results suggest that for every 1 million individuals vaccinated with the BNT162b vaccine compared with the mRNA-1273 vaccine, this would represent 3,448 additional care-seeking cases of Covid-19 at 90 days.",
