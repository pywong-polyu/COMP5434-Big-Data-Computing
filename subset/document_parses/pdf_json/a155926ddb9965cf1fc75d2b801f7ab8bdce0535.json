            "text": "This study investigated the application of a recurrent neural network for optimising pharmacological treatment for depression. A clinical dataset of 458 participants from specialist and community psychiatric services in Australia, New Zealand and Japan were extracted from an existing custom-built, web-based tool called Psynary . This data, which included baseline and self-completed reviews, was used to train and refine a novel algorithm which was a fully connected network feature extractor and long short-term memory algorithm was firstly trained in isolation and then integrated and annealed using slow learning rates due to the low dimensionality of the data. The accuracy of predicting depression remission before processing patient review data was 49.8%. After processing only 2 reviews, the accuracy was 76.5%. When considering a change in medication, the precision of changing medications was 97.4% and the recall was 71.4% . The medications with predicted best results were antipsychotics (88%) and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (87.9%). This is the first study that has created an all-in-one algorithm for optimising treatments for all subtypes of depression. Reducing treatment optimisation time for patients suffering with depression may lead to earlier remission and hence reduce the high levels of disability associated with the condition. Furthermore, in a setting where mental health conditions are increasing strain on mental health services, the utilisation of web-based tools for remote monitoring and machine/deep learning algorithms may assist clinicians in both specialist and primary care in extending specialist mental healthcare to a larger patient community.",

Hypomania is a period of persistent mild elevation of mood, increased energy and activity, while mania is mood elevated higher than what would be expected in the patient's circumstances [1] . Melancholic depression has been a contentious issue within psychiatric circles, with some viewing the disorder as a dimension of a severe expression of clinical depression (\"melancholia\"), while others believe it is a separate type of depressive disorder [3] [4] [5] . Regardless of its classification, melancholic depression is a severe form of depression with prominent neurovegetative symptoms [3] .",

The study further analysed age-standardised incidence rates (ASR) and estimated annual percentage changes (EAPC) of the 195 countries included in the population study. ASR was found to be significantly increased in 29 countries, slightly increased in 132 countries, slightly decreased in 9 countries and significantly decreased in 9 countries [7] . Interestingly, the number of people with depression increased in all five socio-demographic index (SDI) levels (low, low-middle, middle, high-middle and high); however, the ASR only increased in the high-SDI region [7] . Geographically, the number of people with depression increased in all geographical locations. 93.7% of patients with depression in 2017 were found to have MDD [7] .",

The World Mental Health Japan Survey Second conducted from 2013 to 2015 with a sample size of 2450, randomly selected residents between the ages of 20 and 75 [20, 21] . They found a lifetime prevalence of any mood disorder of 4.57% and 7.21% for men and women, respectively [20, 21] . They also found a 12-month prevalence of any mood disorder of 2.24% and 3.26% for men and women, respectively [20, 21] .

Although a cumulative remission rate of 65.8% was achieved, crucially, 34.2% did not improve with medical interventions for depression [27] . For non-remission patients, it is critical to identify the earliest point at which to stop further medication trials because the longer the time to remission, the less chance a patient has of reaching remission [27] .Optimising an individual patient's treatment plan so that they have the highest likelihood for remission is a needed advancement in psychiatry.",

A number of studies have focussed on scraping social media posts to predict depression for example, using multinomial naive Bayes (with an accuracy of 76.69%) and event-driven tendency warning models (best recall rate of 0.668 and F-measure of 0.624) [34, 35] . Other studies have focussed on analysing electronic health records. Nemesure et al. used a sample of 4184 students who underwent a general health and psychiatric assessment for the diagnosis of MDD and Generalised Anxiety Disorder. A high-level XGBoost model was used to produce an area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) of 0.67, a sensitivity of 0.55 and specificity of 0.7 for major depression [36] . Further studies have used ML/DL techniques to classify, diagnose and grade depression using clinical data, externally validated screening tests and biomarkers [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] [42] [43] [44] .",

These were assessed on the basis of past medical history, liaison with GP and, with permission, collateral history from a relative or carer. All patients consented to their de-identified data being included in the Psynary database for the purposes of ongoing research, and the OptiMA1, 2 and 3 studies were approved by the relevant local ethics committees. OPTIMA patients were instructed to create an online Psynary account and complete a baseline evaluation with the in-person support of a psychiatrist or nurse practitioner and then complete weekly reviews either by themselves remotely or with the help of a nurse practitioner with expertise in mental health. The Psynary database then logged this baseline information which included; past history such as family history, past episodes of depression and other disorders, age of onset, hospital admissions, past deliberate self-harm and past attempted suicide; deliberate self-harm questions including suicidal thoughts intensity, suicidal planning and suicidal attempts and other domains such as alcohol intake, current psychiatric medication (name and dose) previous treatment changes and whether they had electroconvulsive therapy sessions. The Psynary system incorporates the Hypomania Checklist 16 item (HCL-16) [114] , Generalised Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) [115] and Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) [25] scores and generates ICD-10 diagnoses for all major mood and anxiety disorders. It also includes the proprietary main outcome measures of this study, the R8 Depression and R8 Anxiety scores. All of these metrics were used in building the algorithm reported in this article except for the HCL-16. When a patient completed a review, the Psynary database then logged; current psychiatric medication list, current alcohol intake, current deliberate self-harm responses, recent electroconvulsive therapy treatment, R8 Depression, R8 Anxiety, PHQ-9, GAD-7 current scores. All of these metrics were used in the review aspect of the model except for the HCL-16.",

To do this, the medications prescribed by clinicians in all reviews are given as a multi-hot vector.

            "text": "2.2 Implementation of long short-term memory model Neural network models have become the de-facto standard in most machine learning applications. There are several choices of architecture for sequence modelling, most notably recurrent neural networks (RNN), 1-dimensional convolutional networks and attention networks [116] . The advantages of the latter two have largely to do with better gradient propagation and performance with long sequence lengths [116] . The Psynary review data, having short sequence lengths and unidirectional chronological structure, appears to be best suited for the simple-to-implement RNN structure. For this particular application, a long shortterm memory (LSTM) network was chosen due to its ready availability in deep learning libraries and proven effectiveness [117] . The architecture of the model in this study separately processes each sequence of reviews corresponding to each medication using the same LSTM network. We suspect that the patterns learned by networks trained in each medication separately are largely similar, and training an individual network for each medication group would severely reduce sample sizes due to subdivision of the dataset. Using a larger, single recurrent network was empirically found to produce better and more consistent results. Fully connected networks filled in the rest of the picture-they were used for feature extraction from both the baseline questionnaire and reviews, and at the end of the network for the final R8 Depression score and doctor prescription predictions. Training was performed in three steps. The fully connected network (FCN) review feature extractor and LSTM modules were first trained in isolation on the R8 Depression score prediction task. This recurrent model was then integrated into the baseline questionnaire feature extractor and final FCN layers with frozen weights, and the remainder of the model trained. Finally, the entire model was annealed using low learning rates. Due to the low dimensionality of the data, small size of the model and its recurrent structure, GPU acceleration was not used. ",

The sex distribution slightly favoured females (57%) and the median age and age range of the participants were 32.5 and 18 to 73 years, respectively (Fig. 4) . Most of the participants were employed full-time (52.4%), spoke English (98.9%) and did not have the support of a carer (85.2%). The patient's age distribution showed two anomalous data points (ages 2 and 17) which were deleted and considered missing data. The participants' psychiatric characteristics were also interpreted ( Table 3 ). The average R8 Depression raw score was 34.28 out of a maximum of 84 with depression remission considered at a raw score less than 14 [28] . The PHQ-9 score is grouped based on severity into none (0-4), mild (5-9), moderate (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) , moderately severe (15) (16) (17) (18) (19) and severe (20) (21) (22) (23) (24) (25) (26) (27) [25] . The participants' average PHQ-9 score was 16.54 (considered within moderately severe depression) with 59% of the participants considered either moderately severe or severe. The GAD-7 score is grouped into mild (0-4), moderate (5-9) or severe (10-15) anxiety [115] . A total of 354 participants (77.3%) recorded scores reflecting severe anxiety. Furthermore, 326 (71%) participants were considered to have a subtype of unipolar depression and 84 participants (18.3%) were considered to have a diagnosis of a subtype of bipolar disorder .

An analysis of a single medication was made difficult by the large variety of prescribed medication, which subdivided the data into very small subsets. To ameliorate this and to reduce dataset entropy, the data was categorised by medication class, with antidepressants divided into groups based on mechanism of action. Furthermore, many patients were given more than one medication at a time, which made unitary classification incompatible with the desired application of the model. Because the best indicator of remission was the R8 Depression score, regression of this value is a very similar task to binary prediction of remission, with the added benefit of giving a measure of expected improvement.",

The most notable of these are bias caused by the skewed distributions of the data, information gaps caused by the selectiveness of prescribed medications and several layers of survivorship bias. Our dataset comes from patients treated in Australia, New Zealand, and Japan and from clinics with different population profiles. The clinic in Tokyo focuses on primary care of mostly foreign residents and make up the majority of the dataset (85.6%), while patients from Oceania are largely secondary care patients. There is also asymmetric representation of medication types. As there were only two psychiatrists prescribing medications for the participants in this study, the dataset is heavily reliant on the two clinicians' experience which could be a potential source of survivorship bias. Our choices for model design also came with drawbacks. Most notably, the aggregation of medication types, the use of regression over explicit recommendation and the implementation of a recurrent model were decisions that compromise the model in specific ways. The prediction of a medication class is less useful for a clinician than predicting a specific medication, as patient response can vary significantly to medications of the same action type. Throughout a treatment, a patient may be prescribed several different medications of the class, which, as of now, our model cannot distinguish in any meaningful way. A possible solution for future work may be to use a finer category system, possible from learned clusters.",

This was another reason that medications were aggregated by class, eliminating the bias coming from preference to a specific The use of recurrent models in neural networks may be on the decline. Many sequence modelling objectives are now better solved using convolutional or attention networks, such as in the state-of-the-art audio generator WaveNet [121] and for translation tasks in transformer architecture [117] . These options have several advantages over recurrent networks, such as shorter gradient propagation distances, better performance with long sequences and easier training. Our choice of using an LSTM caused, in particular, difficulty in training the network, as the parallel fully connected and recurrent portions did not train at equal rates. Using a different sequence modelling architecture would, however, have cost added complexity and development time that we felt was best allocated to other parts of the model.",

The accuracy of changing to Taliaz et al. is the only published study similar to this one. Using genetic, clinical and demographic data from 1679 STAR*D participants, the team generated a hybrid, multi-step DL binary-response algorithm to predict whether a participant was either a \"responder\" or \"nonresponder\" for citalopram (SSRI), sertraline (SSRI) and venlafaxine (SNRI). This yielded an average balanced accuracy of 70.1% for the final test set, compared to a 46.8% initial response rate for participants with MDD. While they used a wide variety of data to arguably create a more visible clinical picture of the participant, our model was able to perform with an initial accuracy of 49.8% and accuracy of 76.5% after 2 patient reviews while accommodating for several different types of medication classes, subclasses and subtypes of depression.",

In 2015, Korgaonkar et al. investigated objective brain volumetric measures of patients with MDD to reliably predict symptomatic remission with their initial antidepressant medication [96] . Their study found two decision trees that had high probability prediction scores of non-remission and were replicated [96] . These were 1) left middle frontal volume less than 14.8 mL and right angular gyrus volume greater than 6.3 mL which discerned 55% of non-remitters with an 85% accuracy; and 2) fractional anisotropy values in the left cingulum bundle less than 0.63, right superior fronto-occipital fasciculus less than 0.5 which discerned 15% of non-remitters with 84% accuracy [96] . Also in 2015, Williams et al. investigated whether amygdala activation stimulated by emotion was a general or differential predictor of response to escitalopram (SSRI), sertraline (SSRI) and venlafaxine (SNRI) using MRI [97] . Their model classified responders vs non-responders with an overall accuracy, cross-validation accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of 75%, 75%, 77% and 72%, respectively . They found that when adding age to a model that looked at the stria terminalis fractional anisotropy and the cingulate fractional anisotropy, their model had an overall accuracy of 74%, sensitivity of 74% and specificity of 75% [98]. Gong et al. investigated the diagnostic and prognostic potential of pre-treatment structural neuroanatomy using support vector machine (SVM) in patients with non-refractory depressive disorder or refractory depressive disorder (two subtypes of MDD) [99] . Sixty-one patients were prescribed either an SSRI, TCA or SNRI. The diagnostic accuracy, sensitivity and specificity when applying SVM to both grey and white matter images were 65.22% [99] . The prognostic accuracy based on both grey and white matter images resulted in an accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of 69.57% [99] . Finally, Costafreda et al. interestingly investigated the functional neuroanatomy of showing sad faces of different intensities to patients with acute MDD before cognitive behavioural therapy to predict clinical response [100] . They found that prediction of remission from MDD was significant at the lowest and highest intensities of sadness. Both situations had a sensitivity of 71% and specificity of 86% [100] . Our optimisation assessment illustrates that our model is highly comparable to these 5 studies when comparing our sensitivity rate (71.4%). What is very important from our results and cannot be compared to these 5 studies are our precision rate of 97.4%, false positive rate of 2.6% and correct change accuracy of 54.3%. Additionally, when solely comparing model accuracies, our model has an accuracy of 76.5% after 2 patient reviews and performs better than all studies apart from Korgaonkar et al.",
