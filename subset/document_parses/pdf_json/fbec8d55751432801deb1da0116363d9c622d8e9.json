To explore the paradox of the pandemic as proliferation meets obliteration, I alternate randomization with redaction within a riotous essamblage combining essayistic principles of \"prepositional thinking\" with bricolage. Neologisms meet textracts of responses to the 21 prompts of the Massive and Micro experiment. Glossolalalararium Pandemiconium comes with a helping of \"lala\" in a froth of babble, doubt, rage, and whimsy. It is a textual grappling with the shock and awe of the everyday, girded by a notion of \"meaningful irreverence\" that underpins my current research.",

            "text": "The compositional complicity of subject-world is, for me, the first question of autoethnography. It is a way of calling up the textures and densities of worlds of all kinds formed out of this and that-identities, situations, scenes, sensory conditions, bodies, meanings, weights, rhythms, absence. A way of sidling up to the interesting or unbearable atmospheres and events of those worlds. A hinge onto a moment of some world's legibility. (Stewart, 2013, p. 667) In March 2020, I began publishing a neologism a day at a personal blogsite called Mmmmy Corona. When the Massive_Microscopic_Sensemaking Project (hereafter MMSP) 24 began I found new apertures through which to splice the micro-w/rites of my be-musings onto a communal canvas. As Ross Gibson writes, After all, it is from these quotidian montages that epiphanies sometimes spark. And through these tiny fissures in commonsense, so long as you can believe that a logic other than chance or chaos subtends them, you might eventually register some gleams of new understanding about the forces that jostle people and nature in space throughout time. (Gibson, 2015, p. 34) My epiphany of 2020 is that if there are any throughlines to COVID-19, they lie within narratives of capriciousness. This word denotes both sudden unaccountable changes of behavior or mood or else changes arising, unpredictably, according to no discernible rules. To reflect this dynamism, I adopt capriciously queerelous methods, reducing 10,000 words generated in reply to 21 prompts of the MMSP into 21 textracts, under 21 25 neologisms, chosen and distributed at random 26 as sub-headings. The resultant essamblage, 27 with its virulent twin-engines, merges genre-bending notions of the essayistic (Singer & Walker, 2013) with ideas of bricolage as made through working with what lies at hand. 28 In so doing, it illustrates how rhetorical instruments may be used to disrupt and order, clarify and subvert (Murray, 2017, p. 254) .",

It performs my commitment to w/rites of \"meaningful irreverence\" that give shape to my grapplings inside The Great Pause. At the same time, it illustrates potencies of artful creative practice to expose meanings inside the mayhem, rage, fear, and uncertainty of the pandemic and beyond into the massive and long-awaited sociopolitical shockwaves that now ensue.",

It sits within a kaleidoscope of queer subcultures and is best viewed through the screen of \"scenes\"-Murray (2020a). 3. The urge to drink, long before the sun is past the yard-arm, with wine o'clock still many hours away-Murray (2020s). 4. To so simplify one's life as to realize one can live well with fewer choices, fewer decisions, fewer interactions with the world-Murray (2020k). 5.

Travel undertaken without luggage or tickets, wherein, through photos or memories, souvenirs, or reverie, you are transported all the same-Murray (2020t). 10. Turning back into a human being under the influence of time and space-Murray (2020o). 11. The fear of missing out on the feeling of missing out-Murray (2020d). 12. The intrusion of a possibly virus-bearing entity into a sanitary sanctuary-Murray (2020n). 13. The state of almost catatonic exhaustion reached by the end of a 5-day work week in which one has been tele-conferencing for at least 2 hr of each day-Murray (2020w). 14. Destructive and damaging acts taking place under cover of COVID (or Commerce, the Commonwealth or Catholicism), while the people's attention is turned elsewhere and they are COVIDazzled-Murray (2020m). 15. Compound word formed by adding iso-(Greek for \"equal\") to -trope (Greek for turn or way). An iso-trope occurs wherever the word isois used in a significant, metaphorical, or recurring way to speak of #isolife under COVID-19 lockdown.-Murray (2020g). 16. The defining spirit or mood of a period of history as modeled by the behavior of the most virulent virus of its times-Murray (2020p). 17. It was the matter of masculinity rather than the race issue that drew me and my white feminist eye here. I acknowledge this is not how BIPOC communities may interpret these events in America. I admit too that while naming America here gives the sentence more punch than calling upon the United States, it also erases the rest of the Americas both North and South of this Ronageist. Ah, language, you wily wench. 18. Feelings of lethargy induced when one opens one's pantry cupboard to the stockpile of chickpeas, lentils, and kidney beans one has yet to consume under lockdown-Murray (2020i). 19. Cabination: A chemical reaction that may occur within a confined space when cabinfever meets cabinfervour, giving rise to a burst of resplendent creativity-Murray (2020b). 20. The capacity to repeat a routine without ever seeming to tire of it-Murray (2020e). 21. Months of life lost wondering when the Anthropocoronacene will end-Murray (2020v). 22. A temporary interval of quiet, or lack of activity, a pause in which we may settle into accordance, even detente, with the way of the world, just as it is, in this fleeting moment. And then it is gone-Murray (2020j). 23. The capacity of a jigsaw to hold you under its spell until all measures of time, place, meaning, or purpose are lost-Murray (2020h). 24. See Markham and Harris (2020) . 25. The only significance of these numbers is to mirror of the 21-day cycle of the MMSP experiment conducted by Harris and Markham. 26. See www.randomlists.com. 27 .
