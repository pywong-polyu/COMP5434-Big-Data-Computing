So far, there is scarce evidence for the current treatment options available for COVID-19. Vitamin C has previously been used for treatment of severe sepsis and septic shock. We reviewed the feasibility of using vitamin C in the setting of COVID-19 in a series of patients. Methods: We sequentially identified a series of patients who were requiring at least 30% of FiO2 or more who received IV vitamin C as part of the COVID-19 treatment and analyzed their demographic and clinical characteristics. We compared inflammatory markers pre and post treatment including D-dimer and ferritin. Results: We identified a total of 17 patients who received IV vitamin C for COVID-19. The inpatient mortality rate in this series was 12% with 17.6% rates of intubation and mechanical ventilation. We noted a significant decrease in inflammatory markers, including ferritin and D-dimer, and a trend to decreasing FiO2 requirements, after vitamin C administration. Conclusion: The use of IV vitamin C in patients with moderate to severe COVID-19 disease may be feasible.",

Patients were treated in the progressive care unit and medical intensive care unit of Albert Einstein Medical Center, Philadelphia, PA (USA). There was no age cutoff or exclusion criteria used. Patients were either on hydroxychloroquine, methylprednisolone, and/or tocilizumab as part of initial treatment for COVID-19. These were given regardless of vitamin C administration depending on the clinical prerogative of the treating physician. Doses of these medications were not standardized as there was no strong evidence for their use. Vitamin C was administered at a dose of 1 g every 8 h for 3 days. Baseline inflammatory markers such as D-dimer and ferritin were also obtained by chart review and compared before and after administration of the vitamin C regimen. Outcomes such as inpatient mortality and need for mechanical ventilation were also obtained. No formal ethical approval was secured as these medications were relatively safe and already part of the hospital formulary. Off label use of vitamin C however was subject to the usual informed patient consent citing the risks and potential unknown benefits. All patients received care based on the clinical decisions of treating physicians; formal ethical approval from hospital Institutional Review Board was not required.",

Vitamin C together with corticosteroids and thiamine was found to be associated with reduced risk of progressive organ dysfunction, including acute kidney injury, and reduction in mortality in patients with severe sepsis and septic shock [10, 11] . However, evidence seems to be conflicting as a recently published randomized trial found no significant clinical benefit [12] . Meanwhile, available literature describes how severe cases of COVID-19 tend to present with severe sepsis, ARDS, and cytokine storm [13] . Because of the septic shock and cytokine storm picture in severe COVID-19 disease, there are concerns for oxidative or free radical induced injury. Since the prevention and management of oxidative stress could be potentially achieved through large doses of antioxidants, this approach may be applicable to COVID-19 with administration of vitamin C [14] . Even though we did not collect data explicitly, further research could clarify the impact of vitamin C supplementation on renal function and development of renal injury.",

While the use of IV vitamin C might be safe and feasible in patients with COVID-19 with moderate to severe disease, we suspect that the effects on mortality and need for mechanical ventilation might be modest at best.

We cannot establish the true temporal effect of these medications due to the small sample size and lack of a control group. Some confounders including disease severity and natural course of disease should also be accounted for. The dose of vitamin C used in this study is low and treatment duration was short which is generally considered safe and inexpensive. We also cannot determine the extent of interaction of these medications with IV vitamin C and the possible effect of a higher dose of vitamin C. We also did not look at other inflammatory markers, such as C-reactive protein (CRP), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), IL-6, or procalcitonin. We were also unable to take into consideration the use of other medications that may influence relevant outcomes, such as angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor agents.",
