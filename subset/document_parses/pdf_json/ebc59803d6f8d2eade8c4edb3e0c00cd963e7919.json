The recent increase in the number of patients experiencing anaphylaxis worldwide has resulted in a six-fold increase in the incidence of anaphylaxis since 1992, with a recurrence rate of one in three [3, 4] .",

In a survey of 15 university hospitals from 2007 to 2011, 42% of patients experiencing anaphylaxis were classified as serious, raising the importance of anaphylaxis treatment [5] . Several studies have identified the ability to recognize anaphylaxis and use epinephrine in nurses, emergency rescuers, primary care doctors, medical workers, and school nurses, professionals who are among the most likely to encounter patients experiencing anaphylaxis [1, [6] [7] [8] [9] . In those studies, there were significant differences in perception among doctors, nurses, and healthcare personnel regarding anaphylaxis, epinephrine dose, and administration methods [1, 6, 8, 9] . Only a quarter of the medical workers had heard about epinephrine injections [6] , and this knowledge was less common in nurses than in doctors [1, 6, 8] . Although anaphylaxis education is routinely included in the nursing curriculum as part of pathology, adult health nursing, or emergency care in most nursing colleges, nursing students' knowledge of anaphylaxis is very low and should be supplemented by education [7] .",

Recordings and on-site notes were taken throughout the interviews, and participants' attitudes and characteristics were described. In the final stage of the interview, the interviewers revisited and clarified any unclear comments. Data were collected from 10-22 June 2018, and these data were organized from 23 June-30 July 2018 by transcribing the recordings and comparing them with the on-site notes. Until 30 August 2018, researchers continued to read and analyze the original data repeatedly. If there were any differences in interpretation among researchers, the process of reading and reviewing the original data was repeated until consensus was reached.",

Nursing students, however, scored low on anaphylaxis knowledge and primary choice drugs [7] , and only 35.2% of school nurses were found to have been educated about food anaphylaxis [20] . In this context, anaphylaxis should be included in the curriculum to promote healthcare providers in responding quickly to changing medical environments and to improve patient safety and nursing quality.",

Since such diverse educational approaches have positive educational effects, it is necessary to introduce various educational methods to improve the knowledge and practical skills of nursing students. Conceptual learning, audiovisual training, kits and dummies-based practice, simulation, hands-on experience sharing, and case analysis and discussion based on each academic stage may improve students' anaphylaxis awareness and practical ability.",

In addition to comprehensive education covering post-treatment care and longterm management for prevention, students showed special interest in knowing the specific treatment processes such as treatment prioritization, using emergency kits, drug administration, and nursing tailored to individual patients. Anaphylaxis is a medical emergency that requires prompt assessment and intervention to reverse the cascade of reactions leading to death; therefore, most academic societies recommend treating anaphylaxis under the guidance of a standardized protocol [23] . Nonetheless, the management of anaphylaxis is not always straightforward. As it happens in other clinical areas, anaphylaxis manifestation may vary over a wide range of spectra and may not present with stereotyped patterns, mandating customized implementation of the protocol [24] . The best way to understand this complex decision process in anaphylaxis treatment would be systematic, specific, and practical education.",

A previous study showed that more than 85% of physicians in a tertiary hospital emergency department answered correctly when asked about treatments and routes of drug administration for anaphylaxis [8] . In contrast, about 57% of interns, medical students, and nursing students correctly chose epinephrine as the first-line drug for treating anaphylaxis [7] . This difference could be attributed to the relatively common exposure to anaphylaxis in the emergency department. Thus, it is understandable that students, having little chance of confronting anaphylaxis situations, want regular education. Our students stated that education once a year would be preferable to reinforce their memory. There has not been much study on the optimal period of education. Topal et al. [25] found that interns' epinephrine auto-injection skills were sustained for three months after basic training and noticeably decreased when assessed after six months. This may provide some clues as to the optimal period of anaphylaxis education (e.g., every six months).",
