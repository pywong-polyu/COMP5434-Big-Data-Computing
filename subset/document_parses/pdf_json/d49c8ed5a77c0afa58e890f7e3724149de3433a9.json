Inadequate geological knowledge affects not only university students but also the majority of citizens who finish their secondary studies without having learned any basic geological concepts. The insufficient geological training of pre-university teachers who are later expected to teach some geology generates a certain degree of insecurity and fear about teaching geology. Therefore, it is imperative to improve training for trainee teachers to replace usual ways of thinking about geology teaching with new approaches that promote significant geological learning. This research has a dual objective: first, we analyze whether trainee teachers' theses include geoscience content; second, we explore how innovative ideas and practices can be translated for educational purposes and to promote geologically significant learning. Our findings reveal that environmental impacts, plate tectonics and the hydrosphere are concurrent topics in the geosciences. However, trainee teachers in Spain prefer to develop biology units because many of them have training in bioscience fields of knowledge. Traditional education based on the exposition of learning material by the teacher was identified as the main learning environment developed in the trainee teachers' theses. However, the number of innovations incorporated into trainee teachers' theses has increased. Through this process, trainee teachers have a critical role to play: encouraging their future secondary students to develop geology knowledge.",

The sciences are introduced early in secondary schools. In southern Europe (Calonge et al. 2012 ) and most Latin American countries (UNESCO 2019a), biology and geology are the two science disciplines that must share teaching time. However, currently, geology instruction is a limited, compulsory part of science and geography curricula and may be available through additional or optional courses in countries such as Australia (Dawborn-Gundlach et al. 2017 ) and the USA (Lewis 2008) . East Asian countries generally teach earth science through science classes, where it is taught mainly by earth science specialist teachers, and in some countries of Northern Europe, it is mainly only taught through geography courses (King 2013) .",

(2013) , half of all 5-to 7-year-olds (52%) in the 32 countries studied had received compulsory earth science education; four-fifths of 7-to 11-year-olds (80%) were similarly educated, as were more than four-fifths (84%) of 11-to 14-year-olds and nearly three-quarters (74%) of 14-to 16-year-olds. However, only approximately onethird of 16-to 18-year-olds (35%) had received compulsory earth science education. In the USA, secondary earth and space science is most commonly taught at the 8th or 9th grade level, and only approximately 7% of high school students in the USA take earth and space science as opposed to 88% who take biology (Barstow and Geary 2002) . In some countries such as the USA (Lewis 2008) and Spain (Pedrinaci 2012) , geoscience subjects are frequently offered to students who are 'unmotivated and unable to do \"real\" science, such as chemistry and physics'. Geoscience has also been an underrepresented subject in Australia. In the state of Victoria, geology as a year 12 subject ceased to exist after the early 1990s. Although it is still offered in other states, enrolment remains low (Dawborn-Gundlach et al. 2017) . At the Argentine secondary education level, geological content is almost nonexistent within the Priority Learning Nucleus (NAP) of natural sciences for the common cycle of all high schools. Such content is also absent at much of the secondary education level except in orientations in 'natural sciences' and 'environment', which have created the new specific curricular subject of 'earth sciences' (Lacreu 2017) . The 2019 UNESCO International Geoscience and Geoparks Programme for 35 non-Latin American countries finds that earth science coverage in curricula across the globe is variable and shows scope for major improvement in several areas and regions (UNESCO 2019b) . In primary and secondary education in Latin American countries, earth sciences coverage in primary school curricula is limited, and in secondary school, it is not viewed as essential knowledge for the exercise of active citizenship (UNESCO 2019a). Therefore, recently, some international organizations have warned that most secondary school curricula do not include a substantial geology component (Pedrinaci 2014) .",

According to King et al. (2013) , earth science content in textbooks around the world is often factually incorrect and may be presented in uninteresting ways. In the early 2000s, Kali et al. (2003) suggested that earth science education was characterized by a shift towards a systems approach.

True acquisition of knowledge happens only when we add new information to previously acquired understanding. According to the constructivists, there is no single methodology but rather a diversity of useful methods. Learning is an active process. In contrast to learning before doing, Pea (2002) proposed focusing on learning in doing, a model in which learners increasingly focus on reallife practices through conversations and activities involving expert practitioners, educators and peers. In fact, as a major benefit of the use of active methodologies, they help students develop their own capacity to research and assume responsibility for their own learning process, in turn solving problems with their own resources (Regueras et al. 2009 ). When active learning is compared to traditional teaching methods, students demonstrate better comprehension, retain information longer and enjoy their classes much more (Freeman et al. 2014; LoPresto and Slater 2016) . Meirieu (1992) proposed organizing learning through problemsolving situations based on the premise that people only integrate new elements if they serve as a solution for a problem situation. The first step of the learning process involves identifying a problem, analyzing it and developing hypotheses for its resolution. Next, students must assess their own ability to solve it, and they should be able to discuss the problem and summarize what they have learned (ChanLin and Chan 2007) .",

Even if teachers ask a large number of questions per class, the questions posed are consistently of the same kind, mainly recall and management questions. They are typically low-cognitivelevel questions that only require memorization. Therefore, teachers spend a large percentage of their communication time asking questions; however, wait time is essential to student thinking. According to Smart and Marshall (2013) , it is necessary to train teachers to increase the amount of time allotted to student reflection after asking a question and before a student responds. The teacher can then adjust his or her questioning based on student responses to engage students in the higher-order process of critical thinking and reasoning. Questions are an essential component of active learning in science and scientific inquiry; however, students' questions are usually infrequent (Smart and Marshall 2013) .",

Possible reasons for the lack of discussion of socioscientific issues in science classes include (a) the contentious nature of such issues in that they may be analyzed according to different perspectives, do not lead to simple conclusions and often involve a moral or ethical dimension (Sadler et al. 2004 ); (b) many teachers' lack of management skills related to leading classroom discussions and the knowledge required to undertake discussions about socioscientific issues, namely, knowledge about the sociological, political, ethical and economic aspects of the issues at hand; (c) fears of protests from students' parents; and, finally, (d) a possible lack of control over discussions (Stradling 1984) .

One of the objectives of the master's course is for trainee teachers to try to improve these learning environments through innovation. Even so, the trainee teachers experienced many difficulties imagining innovative proposals due to a lack of practical examples provided during their studies. The exposition of learning material by the teacher was still used by the trainee teachers (Table 2) . From our analysis of resources used in the didactic proposals, we observed that the projection of slides (46 cases of 76) in PowerPoint or Prezi format was the most used tool as opposed to classic textbook use (15 cases of 76). The traditional educational approach was based on the exposition of learning material by the teacher in addition to addressing students' problems or doubts followed by evaluated examinations and homework. Currently, electronic books are not widely disseminated in secondary schools, which were reflected in their limited use by the trainee teachers in their didactic themes (Table 2) .",

Research on student cognition has demonstrated that students' prior conceptual knowledge influences all aspects of their processing of information from their levels of information processing and their search for information and comprehension to their thinking and problem-solving (Duit and Treagust 2003) . The first step proposed for each teaching unit/curriculum lessons by the trainee teachers as a teaching and learning strategy was brainstorming. This initial activity could involve the use of an oral or a written questionnaire. However, during brainstorming, the teachers typically asked low-level questions requiring mainly memorization, and the mean wait time given was, on average, 1 s or less (Albergaria-Almeida 2010a). The little time spent answering is one of the handicaps of brainstorming. In the didactic proposals of the trainee teachers, the time interval was between 5 and 15 min during the first class. However, more time was spent when a previous written questionnaire was administered. In this case, the most common interval of time was 30 min of all activity. Wait time is essential to student thinking.",

Multiple choice quizzes appeared in the trainee teachers' theses in 2016, and their use has increased in recent years (Table 3) . Therefore, it can be difficult to achieve the steps described by Cotton (1988) : reading the question, deciphering the meaning of the question, generating a covert response (i.e. formulating a response in one's mind), generating an overt response and In recent years, there has been an increasing emphasis on the role played by students' questions in learning science, as questions are an essential component of discursive activity and dialectical thinking (Albergaria-Almeida 2010b). Only six theses of the trainee teachers used relevant thinking strategies and processes (e.g. hypothesizing, predicting and explaining) in their search for an answer. The literature suggests that identifying inquiry questions is the first step of the inquiry process and describes the characteristics of this kind of question. However, Ferr\u00e9s-Gurt (2017) explained that high school students have difficulty identifying inquiry questions when they make an autonomous inquiry. It has been observed that a conceptual understanding of the phenomenon is a necessary but insufficient element of identifying scientific inquiry questions. The progression from initial information questions such as 'What is\u2026?' or 'Why\u2026?' to adequate inquiry questions such as 'What happens if\u2026?' or 'Might difference be observed if\u2026?' has been monitored, and it has been shown that fluent dialogue between students and teachers enhances this process (Ferr\u00e9s-Gurt 2017). Project-based learning (PBL) is an innovative approach to learning that is gradually being implemented in schools as a relevant thinking strategy designed to stimulate scientific inquiry questions. Therefore, the number of theses that use relevant thinking strategies should increase in future years. As Chin and Osborne (2008) stated, the formulation of a good question is a creative act and is at the heart of doing science.",

Few proposals were made by the trainee teachers with only one role-playing game, one escape room and quiz game, and two cases of trivia games (2) mentioned. The most common type of game cited was gymkhana (4 cases) ( Table 3) . It seems as if the idea of having fun and playing games tends to become less important as students make the transition from primary school to secondary school and then to higher education (Kinchin 2018) . However, anecdotally, it seems that learning is much easier when students are having fun and playing games than when they are sitting and concentrating on their learning.

One reason for this is the limited use of the full potential of digital blackboards in secondary schools and master's classes of the University of Barcelona. This didactic resource has not been installed in the authors' university classrooms. Therefore, trainee teachers cannot practice all digital blackboard functions during their master's degree studies. This fact could determine its application in the proposed teaching units, representing only 6 cases. However, the use of digital platforms such as Moodle has increased in recent years (Table 5) . Moodle is an environment that facilitates the transmission of information and interactive participation both in real time through videoconferences and in deferred time through chatrooms or forums (Duart and Mart\u00ednez 2001) . However, the use of this digital platform has been limited mainly to a reservoir of studies, presentations or videos as indicated by low levels of WebQuest use (14 cases of 76) and the limited use of forums and chatrooms. In recent years, other platforms have appeared, including Google Classroom (2 cases) and Google Drive (4 cases). These digital platforms allow for peer interaction and collaboration (Hogan and Fisherkeller 2005) , and it is the view of the authors that teachers should support all available spaces for the discussion Fig. 5 Column graphs of three types of 'learning environment' observed in the master's theses Fig. 6 Problem-based learning (PBL) in the teacher trainees' didactic proposals. The number of cases is inside the bars of peer knowledge such as email, forums, chatrooms and wikis (DeWitt and Siraj 2010). Google Maps, Google Earth and Google Timelapse (9 cases) could serve as powerful web pages for geology learning and teaching processes. Despite the amount of technological resources available to teachers today, it is significant that paper-based sources (dossiers, cards, notebooks, etc.) are still commonly used among future teaching professionals, representing 62 cases of the cases surveyed.",

The results of Burns and Lohenry (2010) for a university classroom in the USA reveal that mobile phones serve as a source of distraction during class time, and students indicated that they mainly used messaging features. There have also been many studies of the effect of phone ringtones on concentration (Campbell 2006; R\u00f6er et al. 2014 ). However, other educational institutions have rejected the prohibition of the use of mobile phones in the classroom on the premise that their use for pedagogical purposes is positive and because it is impossible to resist technological advances. Tessier (2013) is one example of a study in which students were encouraged to use their mobile phones in an environmental issues course to find data and other information, which they then shared with the class. The students felt that the mobile phones aided their learning, enhanced their enjoyment of the class, improved their success in the course, marginally increased their attendance and were not an important source of distraction. Moreover, mobile phones are currently a necessary tool for many educational games such as Kahoot and Socrative and for QR codes.",

However, only 6 cases used the e-portfolio as a strategy to follow up on the learning and evaluation of acquired competencies. Despite the amount of technological resources available to teachers today, it is significant that paper-based resources (dossier, cards, notebooks, etc.) remain commonly used tools among future teaching professionals. The paper-based resource most used to follow up on learning and evaluation was the dossier, referenced in 47 cases of 76. The personal diary, as a classic but original tool for following up on learning outcomes, was cited in 4 cases.",

            "text": "The present results clearly indicate that this type of analysis has great potential particularly for evaluating trainee teachers' interest in geoscience and for the analysis of techniques, strategies and activities that improve secondary students' skills, knowledge and understanding in the geosciences. Our research findings provide evidence of a direct link between the university studies of trainee teachers (mainly the biosciences) and topics and courses explored in the educational units of the master's theses. Biological topics grouped into three large groups-ecosystems, organism kingdoms and biological systems-were the most frequently selected by trainee teachers in their master's thesis. Moreover, the most frequently chosen compulsory secondary course was the 3rd year course with students of 14-15 years of age and without geologic curricular content. There is a clear need for critical and open discussion between academia and society on the role of geoscience in education. The challenge, perhaps, would be to combine good structural and conceptual teaching of geosciences with permanent links to attractive interesting topics, i.e. making earth sciences relevant to daily life. In addition to the need to provide trainee teachers with hands-on experience and practical learning skills with explicit instructions on how to actively participate in and learn less traditional modes, master's degree classes must also serve as a genuine reference model. To date, traditional pedagogical methods such as the projection of slides or the use of classic textbooks have been the most commonly used throughout trainee teachers' education. However, there has been an increasing emphasis on the use of information and communications technologies such as digital platforms or mobile phones and educational games such as role-playing games, escape rooms, quiz games, trivia games and gymkhana to improve active learning in proposed didactic units. The use of PBL is another successful proposed method, as inquiry is an essential component of discursive and thinking activity necessary to improve active learning in proposed didactic units. Environmental themes reflect the current interests of trainee teachers in the proposed organization of learning through problem-solving situations with social impact. The inclusion of current news articles constitutes an example. However, significantly fewer examples are cited in reference to geology. This study demonstrates good implementation in the design and development of assessment processes to emphasize desired competencies. Peer assessment and self-assessment are two successful tools used by trainee teachers in their master's theses to evaluate competencies acquired by students.",

These new approaches are relevant due to the current COVID-19 pandemic. School and university closures resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic have forced teachers across the globe to scramble to shift their face-to-face classes (laboratory activities, field trips and evaluations) online. This rapid change has left teachers little time to prepare for virtual teaching and learning. New virtual skills and tools will surely be developed by trainee teachers in future years' theses even after the current health crisis no longer in effect.",
