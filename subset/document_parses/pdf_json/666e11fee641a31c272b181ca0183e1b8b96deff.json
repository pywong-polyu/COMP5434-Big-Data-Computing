CSPH, Clinically significant portal hypertension. lower lymphocyte, platelet and hemoglobin, higher total bilirubin, longer prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time (Wilcoxon signed rank test, P < 0.05). During the course of COVID-19, the most frequent complications were abnormal liver function (64.7%), kidney injury (47.1%), and ARDS (29.4%), and all CSPH patients showed abnormal liver function. Notably, one CSPH patient developed esophageal gastric variceal bleeding (EGVB), which is one of the most serious complications. In addition, 66.7% (4/6) of CSPH patients were severe cases, compared with 18.2% (2/11) of non-CSPH patients ( P = 0.025).",

However, for patients with pre-existing liver disease, there may be a greater risk after SARS-CoV-2 infection. For example, Ji et al. reported that non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) patients with COVID-19 had a higher rate of disease progression 7 . Cirrhosis patients tend to be at high risk of COVID-19 due to their specific characteristics 8 . On the blood test findings, many indicators were abnormal, which may be caused by the characteristics of cirrhosis, and these may be markers of the severity of COVID-19, such as decreased platelets and lymphocytes 9 , 10 , which were more obvious in CSPH patients. Consistent with these findings, 35.3% of COVID-19 patients with cirrhosis in our study were severe illness, and the proportion of CSPH patients was 64.7%, suggesting that cirrhosis, especially CSPH, may play an important role in the progression of COVID-19. However, it is encouraging to note that the mortality of in this study was not high, possibly because our center has rich experience in the treatment of cirrhosis and CSPH, as well as in the treatment of other organs in conjunction with the multidisciplinary team. When treating COVID 19 patients with cirrhosis, other complications such as EGVB, heart damage, and kidney damage should also be noted in the control of pulmonary symptoms.",
