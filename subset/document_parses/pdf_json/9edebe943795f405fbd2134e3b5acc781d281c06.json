This number can be much higher for rural veteran women who face additional barriers to accessing specialized mental health services due to isolation and cultural factors. This study reports on a program evaluation of MomMoodBooster, a coach-supported internet-delivered CBT program for the treatment of maternal depression in veteran women. Repeated measures ANOVA, run with this sample of 326 women, demonstrated an overall positive effect size across outcome measures and engagement with no differences found between rural women and their urban counterparts. Some differences between urban and rural participants were found in total and average time spent with coaches as well as ratings of coach helpfulness, possibly indicating some cultural differences between coaches and rural women that need to be addressed. These results and the results of earlier trials suggest that MomMoodBooster can be a valid and efficacious option for reaching under-served veteran populations with specialized postpartum mental health support and is as effective with rural women as with urban women",

Moreover, Appolomio and Fingerhut (2008) reported that 19.5% active duty, exposed to combat, first-time mothers experience postpartum depression. Finally, Schachman and Lindsey (2013) found that 50.7% of mothers (enlisted and civilian sample) with deployed partners experience postpartum depression.",

Military mothers face additional stressors such as the increased isolation of living on base, separation from deployed spouses, comorbid diagnoses of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) (Nguyen et al., 2013) , frequent relocations, working longer into pregnancy, less reported support (Klaman & Turner, 2016) , and increased incidence of sexual assault and sexual harassment (Kintzle et al., 2015) . Although much of the literature addressing women's exposure to trauma and comorbid diagnoses are active military samples, it is reasonable to assume that the impact of these traumatic experiences does not end when military commitment ends and therefore also impacts the experiences of veteran mothers.",

In addition, healthcare providers have trouble recognizing PND and PPD (O'Mahen & Flynn, 2008) , which results in low screening and low diagnosis rates (Ashford et al., 2016) . The barriers of greatest relevance to this paper are long wait times for face-to-face services, particularly specialized services, the supermom myth and stigma (Lee et al., 2016) , and geographical-based barriers (Andrilla et al., 2018) . Rural veteran mothers face additional barriers. The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) Office of Rural Health (ORH) reports that approximately 25% of veterans live in rural communities (Veterans Administration, 2020) . When comparing samples of veterans with diagnosed depression, anxiety or PTSD, rural veterans are less likely than their urban counterparts to receive any mental health treatment (Teich et al., 2017) , face longer wait times between diagnosis and first appointments, and are less likely to receive specialty mental health care (Cully et al., 2010) . In general, rural areas are underserved by mental health professionals (Riding-Malon & Werth, 2014) , rural veterans have less access to care, are more affected by distance barriers, and have lower health-related quality of life (Cully et al., 2010; Weeks et al., 2008) . Unfortunately, more specific information about the unique experiences of women veterans in the perinatal period are not delineated in the rural veteran mental health literature.",

Other investigators argue that rural values of independence and conformity to social norms contribute to lower levels of acceptance of psychotherapy (Fox et al., 1995; Rost et al., 1993) .

Additionally, women are more likely to report sensitive information over the internet (Le et al., 2009 ) because this mode of treatment delivery offers anonymity (Lavender et al., 2016) and flexibility to adapt to specific cultural and identity considerations (Lee et al., 2016) . The literature in support of internet-based interventions has resulted in the Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments (Parikh et al., 2009) and the United Kingdom's Improving Access to Psychological Treatment program (Clark, 2011) recommending web-based interventions as second-line treatments for perinatal depression. iTx may be a viable option for a stepped-care approach (van Ballegooijen et al., 2014) to the treatment of PND and a promising option for reaching rural veteran women who would otherwise not have access to specialized care.",

Additionally, there appears to be a dose-response effect with iTx such that engaging in more sessions correlates with better outcomes. No studies have compared outcomes, attrition, and uptake between urban and rural cohorts. More information is needed in order to understand what aspects of iTx promote initiation, retention and completion for specific populations (Renton et al., 2014) .",

Of course, without a control condition it is not possible to directly attribute change to the MomMoodBooster program itself. Nevertheless, while depressive symptoms are known to change with passage of time, the BADS, for example, has demonstrated strong test-retest reliability, and such scores would not be expected to change spontaneously (Kanter et al., 2007) . Moreover, postpartum depressed women in the treatment as usual condition in the Milgrom et al.

The National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH, 2018) indicated that 60% of rural Americans live in mental health professional shortage areas. With respect to veterans specifically, Teich et al. (2017) indicated that rural veterans with a mental health diagnosis are less likely than their urban counterparts to receive any mental health treatment.

            "text": "As noted earlier, approximately 25% of veterans live in rural America. The MomMoodBooster program reached out to all eligible veteran postpartum women, regardless of rural/ urban residence, and surprisingly, only 17.8% of the 8,435 eligible veteran women resided in rural areas. One potential explanation for this seemingly under-representation of rural veteran women in our overall pool is that the VA database only contained the records of veteran women whose maternity care was paid for by VA. Although VA maternity care coordinators provide prenatal care to pregnant veteran women, VA does not provide obstetrical services. Veteran women invariably receive obstetrical care from non-VA providers who are paid by VA. Many veteran women have private insurance or choose not to afford themselves of VA-supported private care. As a result, women who do not utilize VA-supported private care are not included in the database that served as the basis for recruitment. This raises the possibility that rural veteran women are using VA paid maternity care at a much lower rate than their urban counterparts or the possibility that veteran women of childbearing age are more likely to live in urban areas than veterans as a whole. Furthermore, the data regarding veteran rural/urban residence is reported across genders, so it cannot be determined whether the representation of rural women in this study aligns with veteran women nationwide [U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), 2020]. Participation in the MomMoodBooster program largely tracked the overall representation of veteran women in the pool, suggesting that rural veteran women were not less likely to stay the course through the MomMoodBooster program. There were no differences in response to the MomMood-Booster program between rural and urban dwelling veteran women. In the current context, it is reassuring that rural dwelling veteran women are as likely to participate in and benefit from an online, coach supported program for postpartum depression as urban dwelling women. Cultural issues regarding acceptability of psychotherapy, whether provided face-to-face or in the context of an internet-based intervention, appear not to have significantly impacted the outcomes across rural and urban residing veterans. However, there was one area in which rural and urban dwelling women did differ significantly: time in contact with the phone coach. For both average minutes per call and the total number of minutes across all calls with a coach, rural-dwelling veteran women spent significantly less time. This difference may be at least partially explained by the rural agrarian value system which has been associated with distrust of science and technology (Heath, 2020) and the distinct cultural aspects of rural identity that include a skepticism of outsiders (Slama, 2004) . Time spent with coaches may have also been related to the rural values of self-reliance and stoicism. For example, Robinson et al. (2012) argued that these interpersonal approaches to life mean that consulting a mental health professional carries a great deal of stigma, which is a barrier to receiving services. In one study addressing rural low-income women, the prevalence rate of major and minor depression was 38%, and yet only 2.3% of those with a diagnosis were receiving counseling (Price & Proctor, 2009) . It may be that rural women are less comfortable with discussing psychological symptom management in general or feel reluctant to discuss personal matters with an unfamiliar provider. Rural women may therefore have derived more benefit from the anonymity of the online content than the phone coaching.",

Rural women in our sample may not have engaged as much with coaching because of these relatively more well-developed social support systems. Social support has been inversely associated with depressive symptoms. Ross et al. (2011) found that rural women have higher levels of social network diversity which was significantly related to lower postpartum EPDS scores. With respect to reliance on primary care physicians for mental health care, it is important to note that integration of mental health services into rural primary care settings has been suggested for addressing disparities in access to care. Women have expressed that they prefer to have depression treatment considered part of prenatal care (Bhat et al., 2018) . However, with less than one-fifth of rural communities having local obstetrics care (Nidey et al., 2020) , additional options such as remote care provisions like Mom-MoodBooster may be vital to closing the rural-urban gap. Having demonstrated similar effectiveness for rural women makes this a promising option.",

Fifty percent of program participants completed at least 80% of modules. There were no differences across groups. These rates are somewhat lower than two previous MomMoodBooster trials ( Danaher et al., 2013; Milgrom et al., 2016) , but only a total of 74 postpartum depressed women had been included in these two trials. The number of postpartum depressed women in the MomMoodBooster program was nearly five times that of the two previous two trials together. Moreover, rather than representing just a few communities where the other studies were conducted, women in the VA MomMoodBooster program were very diverse in race, ethnicity, rurality, and geographic locale, and represented 46 of the 50 states and the District of Columbia. Participants had very favorable overall ratings of the program (3.21 on a 4-point scale) and the coaches (3.20 on a 4-point scale), though urban veterans rated coaches more highly than did rural veterans. It will be important for phone coaches and staff to recognize the diversity in postpartum depressed veteran women, reflect on cultural opportunities (Hayes et al., 2015) , and adjust coaching accordingly to maximize participants' engagement in the program.",

Additionally, 2375 women declined to participate. These women were most likely to be feeling well and had no need for the MomMoodBooster program. Another 1966 women were ineligible for different reasons. Other women were eligible at screening but were lost along the way.

Staff reached out by letter to a very large number of postpartum veteran women over a 5-year period, signaling to women whether they were well or experiencing mood symptoms in the postpartum period that the VA recognized their vulnerability and was offering a free mental health program that was accessible to them no matter where they lived. Relatedly, program staff were trained to assess postpartum depression and related conditions, addressing previously reported shortfalls in screening and detection of perinatal mood disorders (Ashford et al., 2016) . The MomMoodBooster program for veteran women recruiting strategy provides a layer of screening otherwise unavailable to postpartum veterans, thereby increasing the chances that women in need of services will have access to much needed support. The national reach of the recruiting strategy opens new possibilities for reaching women in rural locations who might otherwise struggle to connect with specialized services. MomMoodBooster is a efficacious (Danaher et al., 2013; Milgrom et al., 2016) and accessible option that for some may be the sole option for managing postpartum symptoms and for others may be one level of a stepped-care model of treatment for PPD (O'Mahen et al., 2013) . The format of the online content is highly structured and interactive, which, when combined with supportive coaching, increases acceptance and reduces attrition (van Ballegooijen et al., 2014) .",

This suggests that the personal contact with eligible women makes a difference in comfort and willingness to engage in services.
