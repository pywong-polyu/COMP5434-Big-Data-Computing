            "text": "Pneumonia is defined as an inflammatory condition affecting the lower respiratory tract and is considered the leading cause of death due to infections in children under five years of age (1, 2) . S. pneumoniae, a Gram-positive encapsulated bacterium, is a major cause of bacterial community-acquired pneumonia and one of the most important causative agents of invasive disease (3, 4) . S. pneumoniae possesses numerous virulence factors required for a successful colonization of the nasopharynx and for immune evasion (5, 6) . Once the immune response and the mucosal barriers of the host become compromised, S. pneumoniae disseminates to other organs, causing a wide spectrum of diseases, which range from mild as otitis and sinusitis, to severe such as Invasive Pneumococcal Disease (IPD) (7) (8) (9) . IPD comprises bacteremic pneumonia, meningitis and sepsis and is considered an important cause of mortality in children and the elderly, representing approximately 12% of deaths every year worldwide (10) . Although a consistent decrease in the prevalence of pneumonia in children under five years old has been reported due to immunization programs (11) , still 3.7 millions of severe episodes of pneumococcal disease and more than 300,000 deaths in children were estimated worldwide in 2015 (4) . Furthermore, lack of effective vaccination programs in developing countries, serotype replacement of those not included in current vaccines and the continuous emergence of antibiotic resistance make S. pneumoniae a worldwide concern (12) (13) (14) .",

            "text": "During S. pneumoniae lung infection, the immune response of the host plays a critical role in the evolution of the infection (6, 15) . The immune response against S. pneumoniae is characterized by the release of several cytokines and chemokines required for the recruitment of neutrophils, monocytes and lymphocytes to the lungs (5), being neutrophils essential for bacterial elimination (16) (17) (18) . However, given that an appropriate lung function is critical to sustain life in mammals and humans, the immune response against S. pneumoniae in the lung must be tightly regulated to guarantee pathogen elimination and, at the same time, prevent excessive inflammation and tissue damage. To guarantee this requirement, anti-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-10, are produced during infection to modulate the lung inflammatory response (19) and restore the host's immune homeostasis (20, 21) . Previous data published by our group showed that IL-10 is strongly induced in the lungs during the first 48 h after pneumococcal exposure (22) . Results obtained in this study highlight that the prevention of excessive lung damage by IL-10 is critical to promote host survival, but it also might favor bacterial dissemination (22) . Identification of the signals that trigger the early IL-10 production in pneumococcal pneumonia remains unaddressed. However, previous in vitro and ex vivo assays have shown that S. pneumoniae might be involved in the induction of an anti-inflammatory profile in macrophages and dendritic cells, which occurs through cell recognition of CpG motifs in bacterial DNA, pneumolysin, and cell wall components such as peptidoglycan and lipoteichoic acids (23) (24) (25) . However, until now, it is not clear whether these stimuli and these myeloid cells are directly involved in IL-10 production during the first 48hpi with S. pneumoniae. In Klebsiella pneumoniae-induced pneumonia, macrophages, monocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells (M-MDSCs) and neutrophils have been described as the main contributors to IL-10 production during bacterial pneumonia (19, 26, 27) . In fact, using a GFP-reporter mouse during K. pneumoniae lung infection, neutrophils were identified as IL-10-producing cells in lungs during the first 48 h post-infection (19) . These findings are in line with several studies, showing that neutrophils are able to produce IL-10 during infection, indicating that these cells might be playing a role beyond pathogen clearance in pneumonia (28) (29) (30) .",

            "text": "Conventionally, neutrophils have been considered crucial players in pro-inflammatory processes and short-lived effector cells that react to infections and different inflammatory stimuli (31, 32) . That view has changed over the last decade due to the observation that the half-life of neutrophils is on average 5.4 days in humans (33) and by the identification of immunomodulatory and suppressive properties in human and mouse neutrophils, such as IL-10 production (28, (34) (35) (36) . In fact, there is evidence that anti-inflammatory neutrophils, expanded after exposure to bacterial components and suppressed the pro-inflammatory activity of macrophages, dendritic cells and T cells in vitro (30, 37) . Based on the potential immunomodulatory role of neutrophils mediated by the production of IL-10, in the present study we evaluated whether the production of IL-10 by neutrophils recruited to the lungs in response to S. pneumoniae infection downmodulates inflammation of this tissue and promotes host survival. Using a mouse model of infection, our data shows that neutrophils contribute significantly to IL-10 production during the acute phase of S. pneumoniae infection in the lungs, displaying a regulatory role and influencing disease outcome. In addition, given the functional and morphological heterogeneity of neutrophils (38) , we characterized the neutrophilic population recruited to the lungs in response to S. pneumoniae. Consistently with previously published data from our laboratory, we found two neutrophil subsets present in the lungs. We then characterized them in terms of morphology and their ability to produce IL-10, providing new insights on the functional heterogeneity of neutrophils and their roles during infection.",

Furthermore, quantification of IL-10-production by each cell population was performed by analyzing the expression of eGFP ( Figure 1 ). Our findings indicate that neutrophils are the most abundant cells that produced IL-10 either at 24 or 48 h post-infection ( Figure 1A ). Ly6C neg monocytes and eosinophils showed a moderate IL-10 production at 48 h ( Figures 1B, C) . Interstitial macrophages also showed a non-significant upward trend of IL-10 + production ( Figure 1D ). Finally, resident alveolar macrophages, interstitial macrophages, monocyte-derived macrophages, Ly6C + monocytes and DCs did not contribute to IL-10 production during S. pneumoniae infection ( Figure S4 ). IL-10 expression in neutrophils following S. pneumoniae infection was further confirmed by intracellular staining with an anti-IL-10 antibody ( Figure S5 ).

Both of these subsets were rapidly recruited to the lungs during pneumococcal infection, although their biological relevance or their morphological properties were not studied (38) . Here, we confirmed the presence of these two subsets by flow cytometry in S. pneumoniae-infected and uninfected mice. We named these subsets as FSC low (N1: smaller size) and FSC high (N2: larger size) ( Figure 2A) . Then, we aimed to determine whether these populations play different roles during pneumococcal infection. We first evaluated the expression of maturity and activation surface markers during the first 48 hpi, but no significant differences in the expression of surface markers in both populations were observed ( Figure S6 ). Next, we evaluated the ability of each of these subsets to produce IL-10. We observed that FSC high neutrophils significantly produced higher levels of IL-10 at 24 and 48 hpi as compared to FSC low neutrophils, which only showed a mild increase of IL-10 production at 24 hpi ( Figures 2B, C ). An additional morphological characterization of identified neutrophil subsets was performed by TEM in neutrophils sorted by size, using fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS). Our results show that purified neutrophil populations have phenotypic differences in the shape of the nucleus and chromatin condensation, number of granules and autophagy-related structures ( Figure 2D ). Specifically, FSC high neutrophils exhibited a nucleus with decondensed chromatin, while the FSC low subset had a nucleus predominantly constituted by heterochromatin. Moreover, we also observed differences related to the number of intracellular granules present in the cytoplasm as well as the presence of autophagy-related structures, particularly in the FSC high population ( Figure 2E ).",

Results showed that only heat-killed S. pneumoniae, but not a soluble factor present in the BALFs from either infected or uninfected mice, stimulated eGFP expression in neutrophils at 12 h posttreatment ( Figure 3A) . These results were confirmed by ELISA, where IL-10 in the supernatant was detected only in neutrophils stimulated with capsulated bacterium ( Figure 3B) . Additionally, we observed IL-10 production 24h posttreatment in neutrophils infected with the non-capsulated strain (MOI 25) . However, at 24 h, no IL-10 production was observed in neutrophils infected with higher MOI of the noncapsulated strain ( Figure 3B ).

Our data show that cell wall extract did not induced IL-10 production in vitro ( Figure 3B ).

Considering this, we aimed to perform neutrophil adoptive transfer assays into Il10 -/mice (highly susceptible to S. pneumoniae infection) to evaluate the impact of the IL-10 produced by neutrophils in mice survival. We transferred bone marrow-isolated neutrophils from WT or Il10 -/donor mice to Il10 -/recipient mice one day prior S. pneumoniae infection (day -1). Survival rate and clinical parameters were evaluated over the course of ten days after infection. Our data showed that whereas all non-transferred WT mice survived until the end of the experiment and had a low clinical score, non-transferred Il10 -/mice had the highest clinical score and 100% mortality at day 4 post-infection. Surprisingly, recipient Il10 -/mice transferred with either WT or Il10 -/neutrophils improved their survival rate up to 60% ( Figure 4) . The increased survival of individuals at the endpoint of the curve was similar in both groups of Il10 -/transferred mice and no significant differences were observed at any point in survival or score curves between these two groups. To further evaluate whether early transfer of neutrophils to Il10 -/mice improve their defense against S. pneumoniae, bone marrow neutrophils were isolated from IL-10::eGFP mice and subsequently stimulated for 12 h with heat-killed S. pneumoniae (MOI=25), to induce IL-10 production. Prior to adoptive transfer, we assessed IL-10 expression and viability by flow cytometry. At the time of transfer, 10-20% of neutrophils were IL-10 + with a viability of 80% ( Figure S7A ). The transfer of these cells at 12 hpi resulted in an outcome similar to the one observed in mice transferred with neutrophils previous infection ( Figures S7B, S7C) . Moreover, at the end of the experiment (day 10), we observed that Il10 -/mice that received Il10 -/neutrophils had higher numbers of neutrophils in the lungs as compared to Il10 -/mice that received IL-10::eGFP neutrophils ( Figure S7D ). These findings support the notion that early activation of neutrophils observed in recipient Il10 -/mice positively affect disease outcome and host survival, in a mechanism that is independent on IL-10 production.",

The analyses of lung infiltration by flow cytometry showed no significant differences in the number of live neutrophils and monocytes in lungs at 48 hpi among the experimental groups ( Figure 5A) . However, our data shows that transfer of WT neutrophils fully restored the production of IL-10 in the BALF of Il10 -/recipient mice at 48 h, although it did not have a major effect in the production of important proinflammatory cytokines, such as IL-12, IFN-g and TNF-a in the BALFs (Figures 5B-E) . To determine that transferred neutrophils remained in the respiratory tract, 1 x 10 6 bone marrow-derived neutrophils from CD45.1 mouse were transferred into CD45.2 congenic recipient mice. Recipient mice were infected 1-day post transfer and at 24 hpi lungs, BALF, blood and spleen were harvested to determine neutrophil percentages from CD45.1 and CD45.2. As expected, transferred neutrophils in the BALF represented 10% of total neutrophils. In the lung tissue, this percentage was around 2-4% ( Figure S8 ). We also evaluated the expression of some homing markers previously evaluated in lung infiltration (CD31, CD44 and CD62L) (42-44) ( Figure S9 ). CD31 was significantly expressed in CD45.1 neutrophils obtained from lungs, particularly from infected mice, which is consistent with data previously reported for neutrophils in lung undergoing inflammation (44) . CD44 is augmented in BALF, indicating that bone marrow-derived neutrophils change the expression of surface markers in response to infection, even when they are intranasally delivered and come from the bone marrow. Finally, the CD62L marker showed low expression in lungs and BALFs, while it was highly expressed in blood ( Figure S9 ), which is in agreement with previous reports (42) . These results show that intranasally transferred bone marrow-derived neutrophils remained in the lungs for at least 48 h after transfer. Further, homing data suggest that an important quantity of transferred neutrophils remained in the respiratory tract.",

            "text": "Neutrophils have been recently described as important actors of both innate and adaptive immunity due to their plasticity and immunomodulatory properties, including the ability to produce IL-10 during several inflammatory conditions (28, 45, 46) . The modulatory role of neutrophils has been described during sepsis (47, 48) and in chronic infectious diseases, such as tuberculosis and Chagas (29, 49) . In agreement with the literature, here we report the existence of heterogeneous population of neutrophils that produce IL-10 in the lungs during S. pneumoniae infection. We observed that among the myeloid cells recruited to the lungs, only neutrophils showed a significant production of IL-10 ( Figure  1A) . The high number of IL-10-producing neutrophils found at 24 and 48 hpi suggests that these cells are key components in the prevention of exacerbated inflammatory response during the early phase of S. pneumoniae lung infection. It is important to note that the involvement of neutrophils in IL-10 production is different among the broad range of pathogens able to cause pneumonia. For example, in viral pneumonia and tuberculosis, neutrophils are suppliers of IL-10 but the substantial production of this cytokine is produced by interstitial macrophages and T cells (50) (51) (52) . In the case of lung infection caused by Klebsiella pneumoniae, M-MDSCs have the leading role in regulation mediated by IL-10 production (19) . This background contrasts with our findings and lead us to propose that the role of neutrophils as the dominant source of IL-10 production is a distinctive feature of pneumococcal pneumonia. Since S. pneumoniae induces a high influx of neutrophils into the lungs that subsequently would produce IL-10, this could be a host mechanism to prevent inflammatory damage activated by bacterial infection (21, 23, 53) . Considering this possibility, a major aim of this study was to elucidate whether the production of IL-10 by neutrophils is triggered directly by S. pneumoniae or whether is mediated by host factors released in response to the infection. It has been reported that components of the cell wall of S. pneumoniae such as peptidoglycan, lipoteichoic acid and lipoproteins induce IL-10 production in macrophages and monocytes after their recognition by Toll-like receptors 2 (TLR2) and 4 (TLR4) (23, 53, 54) . TLR2 and TLR4 are widely expressed in the surface of neutrophils and are important mediators of IL-10 production by these cells after ligand binding (28, 55, 56) . Here, we provide evidence that neutrophils directly produce IL-10 after S. pneumoniae recognition. First, we observed that neutrophils significantly expressed IL-10 during S. pneumoniae lung infection in vivo, and then we confirmed these findings with in vitro assays. Our data show that IL-10 levels in the supernatant were significantly higher when neutrophils were stimulated with encapsulated S. pneumoniae as compared to neutrophils stimulated with the non-capsulated S. pneumoniae. The different abilities observed for these strains to induce IL-10 production by neutrophils are possible related to the capsule expression. Probably, noncapsulated strain expresses surface PAMPs that promote a proinflammatory profile in neutrophils, and higher bacterial loads could increase the exposure to these PAMPs. This effect could be favoring the establishment of an inflammatory response in neutrophils, blocking the pathways related to the production of IL-10. It is also possible that the capsule could be playing a role in coating the pro-inflammatory PAMPs, allowing only the exposition of molecules that might be stimulating IL-10 pathways in neutrophils due to the polysaccharides present in the pneumococcal capsule, which might be activating the paths necessary to activate an anti-inflammatory response. This point has not been evaluated in S. pneumoniae, but recently it has been reported for polysaccharide A present in the capsule of Bacteroides fragilis (57, 58) . Until now, all of these hypotheses have not been addressed experimentally and further studies are required to clarify which bacterial components are the most relevant at inducing IL-10 production. However, based on our results, we suggest that molecular components of the capsule, such as lipoproteins and even capsule polysaccharides, might be potential inducers of IL-10 in neutrophils.",

After the evaluation of the contribution of neutrophils to IL-10-production during pneumococcal pneumonia, we characterized two neutrophil subsets based on their difference in size (FSC low : small or N1; FSC high : large or N2). Further, flow cytometry analyses performed to evaluate differences in IL-10 production showed a significant difference in IL-10 expression between FSC low and FSC high at 48 hpi only in infected mice. This result is in line with a recent study, where different neutrophils subsets were described in blood and BALFs obtained from children with viral pneumonia (36) .",

However, neutrophil plasticity is also supported by other phenotypical characteristics (41, 46) . In this context, we performed analyses based on images obtained by transmission electron microscopy. We observed that FSC low cells are small, with a considerably high number of cytoplasmic granules, a low number of vacuoles and a nucleus mainly constituted by heterochromatin. On the other hand, FSC high neutrophils are larger cells, have low presence -or absence-of granules and have presence of multiple vacuoles. Furthermore, FSC high neutrophils present a significant euchromatin fraction, suggesting important changes in gene expression which might explain their differences in IL-10 production, as previously reported in macrophages (61) . According to these morphological findings, FSC low and FSC high subtypes display similar characteristics to the ones observed in neutrophil subtypes reported in a systemic inflammatory syndrome in response to intravenous Staphylococcus aureus infection (62). Tsuda and colleagues reported the presence of two neutrophil subtypes, the first defined as PMN-I which appeared as small cells with marked pro-inflammatory and cytotoxic properties, and the second named PMN-II, which looked larger and displayed anti-inflammatory properties, characterized by the . Similarly, FSC low and FSC high subtypes have also been described in cancer, and have been associated with anti-and pro-tumor properties, respectively (34) . Noteworthy, in our study we describe that both neutrophil subsets have the ability to produce IL-10. In this line, our results could be controversial according to the research performed in cancer and systemic infection models, where FSC low like-cells show a very limited ability to secrete IL-10 (37) . In this sense it is important to emphasize that experimental conditions used in our study are completely different to those present in a tumor environment or blood, where probably the neutrophil phenotype is conditioned by their anatomical location (46, 63, 64) . Additionally, most studies characterizing neutrophil phenotypes are based in the results obtained from in vitro tests, which do not allow to evaluate the effect of the \"cell-cell\" and microenvironment interaction occurring in vivo, causing biases to the final phenotype observed (34, 65) . On the contrary, here we provide new insights of neutrophil characteristics in the early stage of pneumococcal pneumonia, where IL-10-producing neutrophils have not been described previously. Moreover, according to the results obtained about the ability of both subsets to produce IL-10, we could speculate that FSC high cells are not a different type of cell, but represent a late stage of FSC low cells, which already have the ability to produce IL-10 (66). This fact has been previously discussed, where other authors have reported that \"bigger\" neutrophils might correspond to cells experiencing an aging process or even might be cells going into apoptosis (30, 67) . However, further complementary analyses based on single-cell sequencing would be required to confirm that FSClow and FSChigh are different cell subsets and to find whether they are playing differential roles during pneumococcal lung infection.",

Neutrophil adoptive assays have previously been described in other inflammatory processes (45, 68) , however our work is the first implementing this assay in pneumococcal pneumonia, based on a protocol previously carried out in our laboratory (19) . Here we observed that transferred WT neutrophils restored IL-10 levels in BALF to similar levels observed in control WT mice, reinforcing the idea that neutrophils are an important source of IL-10 during pneumococcal pneumonia. Apparently, this IL-10 levels did not show a clear impact in lung infiltration with proinflammatory cells as observed in cytometry analyses. Regarding this point, the number of neutrophils in the lungs of untransferred Il10 -/mice is around 1x10 7 neutrophils per lung. Considering that the assay performed required 1x10 6 neutrophils per mouse, which represent around of 10% of the total neutrophils found in lungs during pneumococcal infection, it is possible that the amount of IL-10 producing neutrophils required to prevent inflammatory infiltration is higher. We confirmed this hypothesis by adoptively transferring 1x10 6 bone marrow-derived-neutrophils from CD45.1 mouse into CD45.2 congenic recipient mice. This assay confirmed that the proportion of donor neutrophils that remained in lungs corresponds to less than a 10% of the total neutrophils observed in lungs during pneumococcal infection and 48 h post-transfer.",

Additionally, our results also indicate that IL-10 from WT neutrophils had a great impact in preventing alterations in lung tissue. Histopathological changes were evident in Il10 -/mice after WT neutrophil transfer, which exhibited less damage and better lung architecture as compared to the other Il10 -/experimental groups. These results indicate that the regulatory capacities of neutrophils related to IL-10 production seem to be determinant in the course of pneumococcal murine infection both at a local and systemic level, reinforcing the described dual role of IL-10 in infections (69) . Next, to determine the impact of IL-10 provided by neutrophils in mouse survival, we performed adoptive transfer assays followed by a 10-days survival curve. In this experiment we obtained an increased survival in Il10 -/mice that received neutrophils, independent of their capacity to produce IL-10 ( Figure 4) . Our data suggest that the increased survival in Il10 -/mice transferred with WT or Il10 -/neutrophils is due by the sole addition of na\u00efve bone marrow-derived neutrophils directly to the lungs. To evaluate whether the early transfer of neutrophils to Il10 -/mice improved their defense against S. pneumoniae independently on the production of IL-10, we changed the protocol and this time we transferred prestimulated IL-10-producing neutrophils 12 hpi. Taken together, these results suggest that the solely presence of na\u00efve transferred neutrophils modulates the host response due to alternative mechanisms not evaluated in this study. These mechanisms may involve an improved microbicidal effect by transferred neutrophils or an improved activation of other cell types involved in S. pneumoniae clearance, triggered by transferred neutrophils. Further studies aimed at understanding how neutrophils interact and shape the early response in the lungs against S. pneumoniae are needed.",

            "text": "The reduced lung histopathology observed in Il10 -/mice transferred with WT neutrophils following S. pneumoniae caught our attention and may be an important indicative of the role of IL-10-producing neutrophils in response to this microbe. Several studies have shown that during lung bacterial infection, a balanced inflammatory response that promotes an efficient pathogen clearance with a limited tissue injury is required (19, 70, 71) . In this context, we have previously shown that the production of IL-10 is critical to reduce lung inflammation and to improve host survival, but an early production of this cytokine impairs bacterial clearance (22) . This fact has also been observed in a recent study showing that natural killer (NK) cells play a crucial role in pneumococcal pneumonia through IL-10 production, promoting bacterial growth and invasion to other host tissues after infection (72) . We have extended this knowledge, providing evidence that neutrophils are the main myeloid cell source of IL-10 in response to S. pneumoniae after 48 h of infection. Here we also show that IL-10 production after infection is important to reduce lung histopathology but has negative impact on the ability of the mouse immune system to control bacterial burden. We also show that an early neutrophil recruitment is critical to ensure host survival in a mechanism that is apparently independent of IL-10 production. This finding highlights the plasticity and the complex biology of neutrophils that still remain largely unexplored. Unbiased techniques based on flow cytometry or single-cell RNA-seq may be useful to study the role of different neutrophil subsets in human and mice during infection. In fact, a recent study identified 10 different subsets/cluster of neutrophils in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in COVID-19 patients, with potential implications in disease severity (73) . These differential clusters identified showed significant differences in gene expression, showing a co-existence between anti-inflammatory/suppressive neutrophils and proinflammatory neutrophils, providing a more complete perspective of these cells, and also highlights the complexity of neutrophils during infection. Given the data available, it is possible that, in our model, neutrophils play a dual role in the lungs that, on the one side, protect the tissue from excessive immunopathology through the production of IL-10 but on the other side are required for bacterial clearance and pneumonia resolution. Based on our previous study (22) and the data provided here, we believe that the prevention of exacerbated lung inflammation by IL-10 production might be established following the bacterial clearance to guarantee an effective host defense. In this line and considering that neutrophils produce IL-10 before bacterial elimination, we might explain why WT mice and Il10 -/mice transferred with WT neutrophils present reduced lung inflammation and increased lung bacterial burden and dissemination.",

The origin of this discussion relies on one study that show that human neutrophils are unable to produce IL-10 due to an inactive chromatin configuration that impairs the Il10 transcription (75) . However, recent studies incorporating analyses of circulating neutrophils, have successfully shown mRNA expression and increased levels of IL-10 in response to different pathogens and stimulus, and they also have described at least two different pathways that explain its production (30, 55, 76, 77) . This evidence opens up the possibility that, to some extent, characterization data obtained in our work could be further studied in humans during pneumonia",

One of the main aims of this work was to provide new insights regarding the antiinflammatory response of neutrophils during pneumococcal pneumonia during the first 48 h of the infection. Furthermore, here we provide new morphological and functional data of the different lung neutrophil subsets previously described in our laboratory. Additionally, our findings show that populations of neutrophils found in mouse lungs express IL-10 directly in response to S. pneumoniae, having a key role in the outcome of the pathological process. Finally, our in vitro and in vivo data determined the unrecognized role of IL-10-producing neutrophils in pneumococcal pneumonia. Several studies are needed to translate our findings to humans, although our data may constitute the first step that could eventually translate into novel therapeutic strategies that improve the management of patients with pneumococcal pneumonia and invasive pneumococcal disease.",
