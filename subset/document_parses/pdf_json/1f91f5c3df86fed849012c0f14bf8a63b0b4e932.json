In France, there were 3,053,617 confirmed cases and 73,049 deaths [4, 5] . Based on expert opinion and on data from the literature [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] , the high council of public health (Haut Conseil de la Sant\u00e9 Publique, HCSP) considers that individuals most at risk of developing a serious form of SARS-Cov-2 infection are people aged 70 years and older, patients with cardiovascular conditions (complicated hypertension, stroke or coronary heart disease, heart failure), insulin-dependent unbalanced diabetics or presenting secondary complications, and patients with chronic respiratory disease, chronic kidney failure dialysis or treatment for cancer. Another group considered at risk [11] [12] [13] [14] is patients with congenital or acquired immunosuppression (cancer chemotherapy, immunosuppressive therapy, biotherapy and/or corticosteroids with immunosuppressive dose, uncontrolled HIV infection or with CD4 < 200/mm 3 , those who have had a solid organ or hematopoietic stem cell transplant linked to a malignant hematology during treatment), and individuals with morbid obesity.",

This immunosuppression is caused by the disease and specific treatments such as chemotherapy or surgery. These hypotheses have been confirmed by publications [7] [8] [9] 13, 15] reporting that patients with cancer are three times more likely to develop serious complications from COVID-19 than those without cancer. Wang et al. [13] addressed the severity of complications in patients with malignancy. In the report by Dai et al. [16] , patients with cancer were significantly more likely to require ICU admission, have severe/critical symptoms or die, after adjustment for covariates. Deng et al. [17] also found a significantly higher risk of death for patients with cancer than those without. In contrast, Brar et al. [18] observed that patients with COVID-19 and cancer had similar outcomes compared with matched patients without cancer in two NYC hospitals. Most of these studies are of small size, and their results are not fully applicable to the French population, due to differences in population structure, but also different genetic, behavioral and cultural factors.",

However, they were less often obese or overweight, and they were also less deprived than COVID-19 patients without cancer. These findings add to the existing body of literature, seeing as, so far, few studies have described the comorbidities of cancer patients diagnosed with COVID-19. In another study that included all types of cancer, Kuderer et al. [20] observed a higher prevalence of obesity (19%), but their patients were residing in North America or Spain and may therefore be difficult to compare to the French population studied here. In addition, our population is larger, seeing as it includes children and is restricted to more serious forms of COVID-19, since our entire population was hospitalized. As regards social deprivation, cancer is more frequent in low-income populations in France, with the exception of breast cancer [21] . COVID-19 also affects the most underprivileged. However, our data indicate that COVID-19 patients without cancer were more underprivileged than COVID-19 patients with cancer.

We have shown that patients with hematological cancers had very different outcomes than patients with solid tumors, and they were more likely to die than patients with solid cancer without metastasis.

Other studies [23, 28] have shown that among hematological cancers, acute myeloid leukemia or lymphomas led to a higher risk of death than other clinical forms. The high level of ICU access for hematological cancers also suggests more severe COVID-19 symptoms, which could be due to the treatment of these patients but also to the immunodepression that they experience during treatment and probably throughout their lives after the cessation of curative treatments [24] [25] [26] [27] .",

Admission to ICU was slightly less frequent for patients with cancer than for patients without cancer, but it varied according to the tumor subtype. For instance, a quarter of hematological cancer patients was admitted to ICU, while patients with solid tumours were less often admitted, regardless of metastatic status. More generally, it must be noted that patients with hematological cancer were admitted to ICU more often than other patients with COVID-19, up until the age of 80 years. One probable reason for which COVID-19 cancer patients under 40 years of age were dramatically more frequently admitted to the ICU than other COVID-19 patients is related to the age of patients with hematological cancer, who tend to be younger than patients with other types of cancer. Our study also shows that patients with solid nonmetastatic cancer were more often admitted to the ICU than patients in the same age group (<40 years) without cancer. A second explanation may be that these patients are more likely to have more severe forms of COVID-19 infection. However, even if the national database made it possible to refine the analysis in terms of age classes, due to the smaller group sizes, the confidence intervals of adjusted odds ratios are large for patients younger than 40 years. On the other hand, cancer patients in the oldest age group (>80 years) had a slightly lower percentage of ICU support, although non-significant, which contrasts with their high in-hospital mortality. This could reflect the fact that patients may have been assessed for ICU access in terms of clinical status and prognosis. Overall, whether or not a patient was admitted to an ICU seemed to depend, in addition to age, on the seriousness of the COVID-19 symptoms, which may have increased the likelihood of transfer to the ICU, and on the severity/prognosis of the underlying neoplastic disease, which may have contraindicated admission to the ICU.",

In France, the national hospital database includes information from all private and public French hospitals that treat COVID-19 and cancer patients. The fact that these national data are used for the allocation of hospital budgets encourages high levels of data coherence, accuracy and exhaustiveness. Consequently, this study includes nationwide data for nearly 90,000 hospitalized patients (89,530) with COVID-19, among whom we identified 6201 cancer patients. This study is one of the few providing data on all ages and with complete hospital follow-up, thus including all in-hospital deaths, whatever the length of stay. Moreover, we were able to obtain information on metastatic status for all solid tumours, patient co-morbidities, and a measure of social deprivation. In addition, our data set was complete. While information is sometimes not completed in the discharge abstract when there is no impact on patient care, which is often the case for outpatient care, it was not the case for the considered hospitalisations.",

Moreover, we acknowledge that, despite the collection of nationwide data, the conclusions about cancer in children need to be taken with caution considering the small number of hospitalized cases and the small number of in-hospital deaths and ICU support. Secondly, there was a potential for the misclassification of comorbidities, since they were only identified during the stays for COVID-19, but this misclassification bias is likely to be non-differential for the majority of the comorbidities. Acute and chronic conditions could not always be distinguished, for example, where the same code was used for chronic heart failure and for cardiac decompensation. Another limitation of this study relates to the stage of tumor progression, seeing as we only had information on the metastatic endpoint. We had no information on the ongoing treatment at the time of the COVID-19 episode, which would have helped us to assess potentially induced immunosuppression. For instance, a patient undergoing chemotherapy may have decreased immunity with a higher risk of infection. On the contrary, it cannot be excluded that the drugs used in some conditions (e.g., checkpoint inhibitors or tyrosine kinase inhibitors) might have a therapeutic activity against SARS-CoV2, as suggested by some preliminary in vitro or clinical data. More generally, we had no data regarding treatments, so the impact of other drugs that could influence the severity of COVID-19 in hospitalized patients (e.g., dexamethasone, IL6 inhibitors, or ARA2 inhibitors) was also not assessed.",

To our knowledge, this is the largest study in the world so far, and the only one to provide comprehensive data for an entire country. Our study compares cancer patients with COVID-19 to non-cancer patients with COVID-19. This answers a question that was highlighted by Kuderer et al. in their pioneering work [20] as a fundamental issue for clinical management and the organization of preventive measures and that is not addressed on a large scale elsewhere. In light of our results, the measures suggested by some authors [29] to better protect cancer patients seem to be appropriate. These measures include informing doctors about the specific risks of COVID-19 for cancer patients and using an algorithm that has been developed to screen for COVID-19 in patients undergoing cancer treatment [29] .",
