Concerning the intention to get vaccinated, our results are similar to the results of the longitudinal Coconel study conducted by the Observatoire R\u00e9gional de Sant\u00e9 Provence Alpes C\u00f4te d'Azur [10] . Similar to their results, we observed that men were more prone to get vaccinated than women. Women accounted for the vast majority of our study responders, suggesting that in real-life settings, COVID-19 vaccine acceptance could be greater. In addition, older individuals are more prone to get vaccinated in both studies, this is probably due to a greater perceived risk of getting infected and developing a severe disease in older people. In the same vein, healthcare workers were more prone to get vaccinated or to participate in a vaccine clinical trial than the others, it is probably due, in part, to a greater perceived risk to get infected. Healthcare workers are particularly vulnerable and accounted for 10 % of the infected people in Italy [11] .

Out of the context of the pandemics, the feeling to be at-risk for a disease was not the main motivation to participate in a vaccine clinical trial [7] . Moreover, older age was associated (except in the group over 80 years) with willingness to participate in a COVID-19 vaccine clinical trial, this observation contrast with a previous study about willingness to participate in a vaccine clinical trial [7] .

The proportion of French People favorable to a COVID-19 vaccine can appear low, but we have to put this in perspective with the fact that the vaccine would be a new vaccine, and that vaccine coverage against 2009 H1N1 pandemic influenza was only 11.1 % in France [13] . However, a greater proportion of responders to our survey declared they had been vaccinated against 2009 H1N1 pandemic influenza, so this observation may suggest that the responders are more pro-vaccine than the general population in France, and more often healthcare workers. We observed a similar prevalence of vaccine hesitancy than in a recent study in France, which identified a prevalence of 40 % [9] . One limitation of our work may be the use of social media to recruit study participants. Social media users who use these medias as health information sources are more prone to get vaccinated against seasonal influenza in the United States of America [14] . Furthermore, a great number of healthcare workers (43.6 % of the responders) answered the survey and we observed that healthcare workers were more prone to get vaccinated or to participate in a vaccine clinical trial independently of the perceived risk to get contaminated. However, vaccine hesitancy also affects healthcare workers [15] [16] [17] . In our study sample, vaccine hesitancy affects 29.3 % of the healthcare workers and 39.9 % of the non-healthcare workers.

Among the 1,063 men, 883 (83.1% 95% CI80.8-85.3%) are COVID-19 vaccine acceptors, 1,629 women among the 2,196 responders (74.2 % 95 % CI 72.3-76.0%) are COVID-19 vaccine acceptors (p<0.005). The proportion of vaccine hesitant responders who would probably be willing to get vaccinated against COVID-19 vaccine was 61.9 % (95 % CI 59.1-64.7 %) during the current pandemics. The proportion of healthcare workers willing to get vaccinated was 81.5 %, and this proportion was 73.7 % in non-healthcare workers (p<0.005).Factors associated with COVID-19 acceptance are displayed inTable 2. In multivariable analysis, older age, male gender, fear about COVID-19, be healthcare workers and individual perceived risk remained associated with COVID-19 vaccine acceptance. Vaccine hesitancy was associated with lower acceptance of a COVID-19 vaccine.Willingness to participate in a COVID-19 vaccine clinical trialOne thousand and five hundred and fifty two responders (47.6 % 95 % CI 45.9-49.3 %) will certainly or probably be willing to participate in a COVID-19 vaccine clinical trial. Among the 1.063 men, 634 (59.6 % 95 % CI 56.7-62.5 %) will probably accept to participate in a COVID-19 vaccine clinical trial, this proportion is significantly greater than women (41.8 % 95 % CI 39.7-43.9 %, p< 0.005). The percentage of potential participants in a COVID-19 vaccine clinical trial was 56.8 % (53.4-60.2 %) in the 50-64 years age group, and 58.7 % ( 95 % CI 52.8-64.6 %) in the 65-80 years age group.", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF4": {"text": "Factors associated with COVID-19 vaccine acceptance expressed with odds ratio (ref: reference* p<0.1, ** p<0.005), in multivariable analysis, only variables with a p-value<0.1 in univariate analysis were integrated in the model.", "latex": null, "type": "table", "html": "<html><body><table><tr><td>\u00a0</td><td>Univariate analysis </td><td>Mutivariable analysis </td></tr><tr><td>Gender </td><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td></tr><tr><td>Male </td><td>2.057 (1.773-2.388)** </td><td>1.881 (1.532-2.309)** </td></tr><tr><td>Female </td><td>Ref </td><td>Ref </td></tr><tr><td>Age </td><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td></tr><tr><td>Under 30 years old </td><td>Ref </td><td>Ref </td></tr><tr><td>30-49 years old </td><td>1.043 (0.868-1.254) </td><td>1.518 (1.220-1.888)** </td></tr><tr><td>50-64 years old </td><td>1.797 (1.461-2.211)** </td><td>1.481 ( 1.297-1.690)** </td></tr><tr><td>65-80 years old </td><td>1.941 (1.458-2.585)** </td><td>1.408 (1.229-1.612)** </td></tr><tr><td>Over 80 years old </td><td>0.608 (0.185-1.993) </td><td>1.494 (0.881-2.531) </td></tr><tr><td>Healthcare workers </td><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td></tr><tr><td>No </td><td>Ref </td><td>Ref </td></tr><tr><td>Yes </td><td>1.223 (1.065-1.405)** </td><td>1.540 (1.275-1.860)** </td></tr><tr><td>Chronic medical conditions </td><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td></tr><tr><td>No </td><td>Ref </td><td>\u00a0</td></tr><tr><td>Yes </td><td>1.085 (0.924-1.274) </td><td>\u00a0</td></tr><tr><td>Fear about COVID-19 </td><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td></tr><tr><td>No </td><td>Ref </td><td>Ref </td></tr><tr><td>Yes </td><td>0.895 (0.764-1.048) </td><td>0.928 (0784-1.099) </td></tr><tr><td>Perceived individual risk </td><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td></tr><tr><td>No </td><td>Ref </td><td>Ref </td></tr><tr><td>Yes </td><td> 1.226 (1.061-1.417)** </td><td>1.235 (1.061-1.439)** </td></tr><tr><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td><td>Vaccine hesitancy </td></tr></table></body></html>"}, "TABREF5": {"text": "Table 1: Demographic characteristics of the responders to the on-line survey, data are expressed by n and (%)", "latex": null, "type": "table", "html": "<html><body><table><tr><td>\u00a0</td><td>Univariate analysis </td><td>Mutivariable analysis </td></tr><tr><td>Gender </td><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td></tr><tr><td>Female </td><td>Ref </td><td>Ref </td></tr><tr><td>Male </td><td>1.707 (1.417-2.058)** </td><td>1.878 (1.529-2.306)** </td></tr><tr><td>Age </td><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td></tr><tr><td>Under 30 years old </td><td>Ref </td><td>Ref </td></tr><tr><td>30-49 years old </td><td>1.506 (1.231-1.842)** </td><td>1.532 (1.230-1.909)** </td></tr><tr><td>50-64 years old </td><td>2.246 (1.758-2.870)** </td><td>1.445 (1.259-1.658) ** </td></tr><tr><td>65-80 years old </td><td>2.692 (1.854-3.908)** </td><td>1.395 (1.198-1.624) ** </td></tr><tr><td>Over 80 years old </td><td>5.593 (0.723-43.293)* </td><td>1.412 (0.827-2.412) </td></tr><tr><td>Healthcare workers </td><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td></tr><tr><td>No </td><td>Ref </td><td>Ref </td></tr><tr><td>Yes </td><td>1.574 (1.329-1.864)** </td><td>1.533 (1.269-1.851)** </td></tr><tr><td>Chronic medical conditions </td><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td></tr><tr><td> No </td><td>Ref </td><td>\u00a0</td></tr><tr><td>Yes </td><td>1.196 (0.983-1.455)* </td><td>0.891 (0.713-1.113) </td></tr><tr><td>Fear about COVID-19 </td><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td></tr><tr><td>No </td><td>Ref </td><td>Ref </td></tr><tr><td>Yes </td><td>2.095 (1.757-2.499)** </td><td>2.445 (1.998-2.991)** </td></tr><tr><td>Perceived individual risk </td><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td></tr><tr><td>No </td><td>Ref </td><td>Ref </td></tr><tr><td>Yes </td><td>1.831 (1.549-2.163)** </td><td> 1.510 (1.269-1.851)** </td></tr><tr><td>Vaccine hesitancy </td><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td></tr><tr><td>No </td><td>Ref </td><td>Ref </td></tr><tr><td>Yes </td><td>0.279 (0.236-0.331)** </td><td>0.275 (0.230-0.329)** </td></tr></table></body></html>"}, "TABREF6": {"text": "Table 3 Factors associated with potential participation in a COVID-19 vaccine trial expressed with odds ratio (*", "latex": null, "type": "table", "html": "<html><body><table><tr><td>No </td><td>Ref </td><td>Ref </td></tr><tr><td>Yes </td><td>0.502 (0.433-0.582)** </td><td>0.512 (0.4411-0.595)** </td></tr></table></body></html>"}}, "back_matter": [{"text": "All rights reserved.
