We use the abbreviation R&W throughout. We acknowledge and accept that many are using the phrase 'religious education' or 'RE' to refer to the school subject.) find their voice as leaders. At the heart of the project's successful impact is a steering group which not only manages the programme, but models collaboration across the R&W eco-system. Here we reflect as a team on the process of programme development particularly during the Covid-19 pandemic. We consider what we have learned individually and as a team, and how we each perceive the impact of the programme so far. We use a collective writing method, identifying key themes arising from the different perspectives and draw conclusions. This approach mirrors the way in which the team worked together reflecting the values of the joint funders such as integrity, openness, empowerment, and service. We conclude by offering this model as a way of working strategically across multiple diverse organisations.",

In order to foster engagement and collaboration the main professional groupings working within the subject in England and wales were invited to participate, in particular AULRE, AREIAC, NASACRE, NATRE and the REC. 1 The meeting was convened under the auspices of the charitable foundation Culham St Gabriel's Trust, under the directorship of Kathryn Wright. In recent years there had been other initiatives to develop leadership in the wider R&W community. 2 Kathryn also investigated other leadership programmes such as those run by the Chartered College of Teaching (https:// chart ered. colle ge/ chart ered-teach er/) and the Historical Association's Chartered Teacher Programme (https:// www. histo ry. org. uk/ secon dary/ categ ories/ CTHist) which have strong research foci. Kathryn also drew upon the discourse on theory of change. 3 Culham St Gabriel's Trust has a history of funding projects which explore the relationship between research and practice in R&W. These currently include projects relating to curriculum, technology and the climate crisis. A vital element of the leadership programme was the importance and value of real world research; research rooted in classroom practice. The value of such research is well documented (see for example Baumfield et al., 2013) .",

Thus, there was a desire to work together strategically for the benefit of the whole subject community and a steering group with representatives (where possible) from these different organisations was created.

In order to facilitate both collaboration and allow each voice to be heard, each member of the steering team was invited to share themes and insights that struck them. Each was invited to write in first person and refer to others using first names. Kathryn Wright provided the opening introduction and drew together the conclusions. Our hope is that this article will provide a rich, personal and diverse commentary on the programme and the benefits of collaboration in furthering the cause of R&W.",

I too had a dream over six years ago now when I wrote a paper to the AREIAC Executive (Association of Religious Education Inspectors, Advisers and Consultants) about mentoring and the need to mentor new leadership in our R&W community. Over the last 30 years the usual ways teachers might develop greater levels of leadership in R&W has dramatically changed, as education systems have been altered by government after government. I felt this meant the R&W leadership community was in danger of not sharing the wealth of its combined knowledge and expertise with potential new leaders, or even worse there not being any new R&W advisers. For me the leadership programme pilot has provided a framework for everyone involved-mentees, mentors and the steering group to grow and develop. It may be because I have spent the last year doing my garden in lockdown, but plants need the right soil, environment (some like it sunny, some like shade), nutrients and support to flourish. I believe the strength of this programme comes from us meeting all the needs in different ways for each participant.",

Beginning with excitement and anticipation at the learning ahead often led to a real concern after two or three months about the amount of work ahead and the belief that they were not good enough for such a journey. It can take some people many months to battle through this and come out the other side to achieve success. For some, it does not happen at all and they do not continue with their studies or achieve what they know they are capable of.

An AREIAC conference in July 2019, gave me an understanding of the aims of the REvitalise programme, and an insight into its impact: I had been blown away listening to the participants of the programme talking about their experience; their enthusiasm for the journey they had been on, their newly amplified connection with the subject and the way it had allowed them to think about strategic leadership in the subject were all really infectious! At its heart, the leadership programme aims to help teachers flourish in their classroom practice, curriculum vision, political activism and research awareness. This really connects with my own interests for R&W. What I most enjoyed about my mentoring experience was having the opportunity to open up conversations leading to real growth and development in these areas. The aspect that participants seemed to feel most in need of developing was research awareness and engagment. This is, perhaps, not surprising, given that most teachers are focused on the delivery of their own curriculum: planning, preparing, teaching, marking. That's the day job, and it's full-on, even for teachers who are not full time. What few of us find enough energy for is deep reading and active research. These are luxuries. So, the way in which the programme was able to set up opportunities for mentees to engage in collaborative reading and to plan their own original research was an invaluable feature.",

Pat's evaluation of the unfolding story of R&W, with her analysis on the ideas from some of the leading figures in the subject, provided great material to help us consider where the subject has come from and how it continues to change. This was a great way to start, exploring a serious piece of academic writing which sets out a particular view of the history of RE in English schools. Our next reading assignment was to explore the report Worldviews in Religious Education (Cooling, Bowie, Panjwani, 2020) . This inspired considerable discussion, with participants feeling that there was much material here to share with colleagues in staff professional development or in initital teacher education. Many felt that the approach sat well with the way they already teach R&W, representing a direction in which they believe the subject needs to evolve. One significant question which arose from the conversation was around whether a worldviews approach is too complex for younger learners (e.g. at Key Stage One). There was general agreement that this is not the case, but it will be important to see what research can be done in this area in the coming years. It was suggested that by introducing pupils to a set of technical vocabulary at an early age there is no reason why they cannot engage in complex discussions about a diversity of beliefs, setting a good platform for later understanding.",

This allowed for an interesting dynamic because professionally I am secondary R&W teacher who combines this role as an educational researcher (who specialises in Catholic education). A perennial problem, in my experience in the UK, is that primary school and secondary teachers do not spend anywhere near enough time in professional conversation.

In the initial mentoring sessions exciting plans for offering short papers at AULRE's conference events were mooted. However, we had not factored in the unfolding events related to the Covid-19 pandemic and the ensuing lockdown(s). Our plans for real-life meetings quickly evaporated and the dawning reality that life, including academic conferences were to be postponed or eventually move to be on-line events, began to slowly sink in. Against this context I proposed to my mentee that we create a reading group with the intention of giving a careful reading to a number of academic texts that reviewed the history of Religious Education in England and Wales. Besides the practical advantages of convening an on-line reading group, there were several deeply academic reasons behind the choice of topic. First, in order to orientate my mentee into the academic debates in R&W it is essential to help him navigate his way around their historical roots. Second, there are several emerging researchers who have written excellent academic accounts of the history of the subject in England. These historical narratives have their context in doctoral thesis and as such represent the cutting edge of academic work in the subject. Reading doctoral level work is not something that one typically comes across in routine life as an R&W practitioner. It is a distinctive genre of academic writing. Opening it up to my mentee proved to be an apt way of engaging with more academic aspects of R&W. In practical terms the reading groups spanned over four sessions, meeting every other week. One of the unforeseen benefits of the lockdown is that many of the other Stage One and Stage Two mentees were also able to participate in the reading group. To assist with the discussion and reading, I identified questions designed to critically engage with the text and identify the underlying arguments in the historical narrative. The discussions were engaging and thought provoking, and had the advantage of giving me further opportunities to work with my mentee. As an individual mentor, it was good to also engage with the other participants in the leadership group.",

Justine uses a different metaphor of journey, but again highlights the ways in which participants overcame obstacles and challenges through encouragement and care. Ed uses growth and flourishing metaphors to describe the way in which teachers gained confidence to engage in research. Sean speaks of the power of professional in-depth conversation and helping teachers understand the historical and contextual dimensions of being part of the R&W community. Throughout the reflections, the importance of personal relationship, coming alongside one another and mutual trust are stressed. This applied in each case not only to the participants, but also to the groups of mentors and the steering group. The expectations of the relationship between mentor and mentees were set out clearly at the start, so that a nourishing and supportive approach was cemented. This mirrored the open and transparent virtual space created by the diverse steering group, leading to a 'virtual' ethos within the communities of practice themselves. As Fiona has indicated in her reflections, this form of steering group could be used for other initiatives to bring together diverse voices from across the R&W eco-system, where a hospitable space is created characterised by service, integrity and honesty. In this particular case, the outcome of creating this flourishing environment was that each participant has been able to find their voice as a leader. They are now ready to serve and empower others.
