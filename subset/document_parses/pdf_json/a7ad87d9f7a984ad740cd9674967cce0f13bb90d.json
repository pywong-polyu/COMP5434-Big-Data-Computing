These interventions to induce a price recovery have created a not-so-unreasonable expectation that any future precipitous stock price declines may also elicit a similar response from the central bank, especially during an election year under heavy political pressure. If rising stock prices are considered normal by investors and policymakers, and the latter tend to intervene to engineer a recovery from sharp declines, it does not seem unreasonable to believe (as some do) that the stock market will always go up. This expectation of policy has earned its own moniker of \"central bank put\".",

Figure 2 summarizes the average price data during 16 periods of six low-and six high-liquidity independent sessions that involved a total of 180 human subjects.",

Even in a world of rational investors, not everyone believes that all others are and will be rational; i.e., belief in the rationality of other investor is unlikely to be common knowledge in the investor community.",
