Crucial questions that need to be addressed are the use of formal models of a \"culture of prevention\"; how the interplay of local values, alliances, and co-creational processes can be reflected in other experiences; and evaluation of the culture change itself.",

These efforts are laudable, most of the time leading to the identification of similar or identical ingredients\" (perhaps not surprising since the contributors may share similar academic and network environments). Examples of these ingredients are the translation in the current practice of effective interventions (Heikkil\u00e4 et al. 2020) and envisioning multi-level (system) changes and partnerships (Bollmann et al. 2020; Exner-Cortens et al. 2019; Murphy et al. 2018; Sentell et al. 2018 ). These efforts are courageous, because they use \"cultural models\" as a proactive and conscious process, far from the historically more common inductive process of deriving cultural models to classify and interpret facts and observations. However, I feel the urgency of sharing thoughts on a more fundamental question: why do we need formal models of something so elusive as \"culture-shaping\"? How are we going to use these formal models? The paper by Bollmann et al. (2020) contains valuable hints to address these questions. Perhaps, we should explicitly endorse the challenge that cultural models of prevention should be used to make previsions, not to explain what just happened or to constrain specific actions in a definite frame. As such, they should be theoretically robust but also dynamic and timely. This point is intimately laced to the need for evaluation, which I will address below.",

These communityshared values are so influential in determining the uptake, and the effects of a particular action that claims of similarity of contexts based on the prevalence of behaviors or health care infrastructure are not enough. To clarify, I am not dismissing the transfer of successful experiences. What I am proposing is a comprehensive approach to the exportability of programs, first of all, distinguishing methods from prototypes (Hawkins et al. 2017 ) and (second, but most important) resting on more complex re-creational and co-creational processes (see also point 3 below). This approach may ultimately result in new prototypes, at times quite distant from the original ones. While the initial prototype may continue to serve as an inspirational source, the new prototypes will be the ones with a likely impact on the communities' health.",

Because of this upward shift, prevention scientists are more often called to address social processes.

Again, all contributions in this issue of Prevention Science highlight the need for a sound evaluation at some point in the process of creating a culture of prevention. However, I discern two distinct ways with which this need is felt and addressed. On the one side, evaluation is advocated as a necessary component of a sustainable culture of prevention (Heikkil\u00e4 et al. 2020 ), a practice that transforms the traditional (and in some contexts still dominant) culture of \"no evidence of harm\" (how often assessed, by the way?) into a progressive culture of \"evidence of benefits\" and of \"benefits for investments.\" This task is becoming increasingly demanding, along with the increasing complexity of prevention targets, and requires pioneer methodologic approaches involving triangulation of questions (Munaf\u00f2 and Davey Smith 2018) and cascades of interconnected outcome measures. But there is another discourse on evaluation trickling through the contributions in this issue of Prevention Science, namely, the need to evaluate the progress in \"culture building.\" When do we know that culture has changed? And how do we know that the change is going to stay? What does the balance between rupture and continuity look like? There is no better time than the present one to attend to these questions when collective responses to the COVID-19 pandemic are modeling our \"health culture\" beyond any expectation.",
