After adjusting for confounding factors, adverse reactions to other vaccines, worry about adverse reactions, knowledge of the inactivated vaccine being used in the hospital, taking the vaccine for one's family proactively and receiving an influenza vaccination were significantly related to adverse reactions to both injections in women. In contrast, in men, concerns about adverse reactions independently increased the risk of adverse reactions following either vaccination, and a history of adverse reactions to other vaccines also increased the risk of adverse reactions to both injections.",

Vaccination to prevent severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) infection is considered the most promising approach for controlling the pandemic. As of 1 June 2021, at least 13 different vaccines (across four platforms) have been administered, and six different vaccines have been listed for WHO Emergency Use Listing (EUL) (1), including the Pfizer/BioNtech Comirnaty vaccine, the AstraZeneca vaccine (AZD1222), the Janssen vaccine (Ad26.COV 2.S), the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine (mRNA-1273), the Sinopharm vaccine, and the Sinovac-CoronaVac. These vaccines have been demonstrated to be safe and efficacious. In China, two inactivated virus vaccines (the Sinopharm vaccine and the Sinovac-CoronaVac) were the first approved for mass vaccination. Although vaccines are widely available and vaccination rates are rising, people remain reluctant to get vaccinated immediately. Following a number of severe cases of blood clots after vaccination, some European countries have temporarily suspended AstraZeneca (AZD1222) vaccinations either fully or partially due to fear regarding thrombosis (2) . Therefore, there is an urgent need to monitor and evaluate the safety of post-marketing vaccines as soon as possible.",

Given the natural differences between two genders, women have stronger immune responses to foreign antigens and to selfantigens than men (4) . Sex disparity should be taken into account in treatment and vaccine development. According to experience in monitoring adverse reactions to vaccines, many vaccines have shown sex differences (5, 6) . Women tend to be more sensitive to vaccine reactions and are more prone to frequent and severe adverse effects. However, few studies to date have reported adverse events by sex, and very few analyses have evaluated sex differences in regard to the safety of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines.",

Solicited systemic adverse reactions included muscle pain, fatigue, headache and/or dizziness, fever, vomiting, diarrhea, appetite impairment, nausea, allergic reaction, urticaria, rash, severe fever, lymphadenopathy, cough, throat pain, stuffy, and runny nose. The unsolicited adverse reactions included other adverse reactions with an opentext response option in the questionnaire, such as menstruation, chest pain, and numbness of limbs, which were absent or seldom in the manual. Knowledge of the inactivated vaccine being used in the hospital was measured by the following question: \"What platform of the COVID-19 vaccine do you think is being used in our hospital?\" Attitudes towards the COVID-19 vaccine were tested by the questions \"If conditions permit, will you take the COVID-19 vaccine for your family proactively?\" and \"Are you concerned about adverse effects of the COVID-19 vaccine?\" History of adverse reactions to other vaccines, influenza vaccination, allergies, and underlying diseases was classified as yes or no. Health status and sleep quality before vaccination were categorized as good or bad. Positions were grouped into health professionals (doctors, nurses, medical technicians or pharmacists) and administrative support staff. Overweight and obesity were defined as a BMI greater than or equal to 24 kg/m 2 according to Chinese criteria.",

This study was conducted with 1,107 women and 290 men who worked at a hospital in China during the period of emergency use of the vaccine. Our findings showed that the frequency of overall adverse reactions was higher in women than in men, regardless of whether it was the first or second injection. The most common adverse reaction was localized pain at the injection site, followed by muscle pain, fatigue, and headache and/or dizziness in both women and men. Almost all types of adverse reactions were more common in women than in men. These findings related to sex differences were similar to those observed regarding other vaccines against influenza, hepatitis B, and yellow fever (10) . A systematic review published in 2019 also showed a higher frequency of adverse events in women after influenza vaccination (5), particularly local reactions. A real-world study based on the national post-marketing surveillance data for the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines in the United States found that more females reported adverse events following COVID-19 vaccination, compared to males, but males were more likely to experience serious adverse events, death, and hospitalization than females (11) . More women developed anaphylaxis reactions to the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine in U.S. (12, 13) , UK (14) and Japan (15) . The sex disparity of adverse reactions was also observed following AstraZeneca (AZD1222) Vaccine or BNT162b2 COVID-19 Vaccine in South Korea (16, 17) . A retrospective descriptive study using spontaneous reports showed that thrombotic adverse reactions were associated with the COVID-19 AstraZeneca vaccine, in which approximately Statistically significant values at p < 0.05 are shown in bold.",

            "text": "The pathophysiology of sex differences in adverse reactions following immunization is multifactorial. Clear biological differences between the sexes can usually be attributed to immunological, hormonal, or genetic factors or a combination of the three. Adult females tend to have stronger inflammatory responses to vaccines than males, and these differences may result in both the female-biased efficacy of vaccines and female-biased adverse events following vaccination. Sex hormones modulate the function of immune cells, including \u03b2 cells, which results in differential immune responses between the sexes. Oestrogens have immune-suppressive effects at higher levels and immunestimulant activity at lower levels (20, 21) , while testosterone suppresses innate immune responses at all times. Females have two X chromosomes which carry many genes related to immune mechanisms, while males just have one. Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a functional receptor for SARS-CoV-2, is encoded by its homologous gene (ACE2), which maps on chromosome X (Xp2.22) (22) . Recent research has demonstrated that the angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) receptor is an essential port of cell entry for the spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2 (23) . It has been reported that estrogen (17\u03b2-estradiol) inhibits ACE2 activity, but androgen upregulates the activity of ACE2 (24, 25) . Beyond the biological differences, a growing body of evidence supports gender-based social/behavioral differences in vaccine response, such as different comorbidity rates (e.g. obesity, hypertension, and cardiovascular diseases), smoking and drinking habits, educational levels, and societal roles (10) . A recent study demonstrated that the expression of ACE2 increases under cigarette smoke exposure and inflammatory stimulation (26) . The smoking rate is typically higher among men than among women (50.5 vs. 2.1%) according to the 2018 Global Adult Tobacco Survey (27) . The prevalence of obesity among men was 2.7 times higher than that among women in this study. Women constitute the majority of nurses and caregivers both in hospitals and within families, with 70% of the world's healthcare staff is composed of women. Women were more likely to perceive and/or report adverse reactions compared to men, leading to a higher response rate (28) . In addition, social culture contexts, such as Confucian morals and socialistic norms, will be also related to disparities in health-seeking behavior and reporting adverse reactions between men and women (29, 30) . Despite this recognition, there is little evidence demonstrating these effects. Further research is needed to clarify whether the observed sex differences are primarily due to a disproportionate share of unhealthy behavior between genders or are related to different immune responses or other factors.",
