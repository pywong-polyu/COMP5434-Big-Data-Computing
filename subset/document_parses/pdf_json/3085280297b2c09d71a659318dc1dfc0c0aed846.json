The pathogen showed a rapid spread that led to a global pandemic and a public health emergency of international concern due to the burden on the healthcare system and lack of specific treatments. By April 26th 2020, the COVID-19 outbreak has affected more than 2.8 million people and claimed the lives of more than 190,000 patients around the globe (2) . Patients with cancer are regarded as a more vulnerable population because of their immunosuppressive state induced by the malignancy, therapy, and associated comorbidities (3, 4) . As a result, despite the limited available data, the oncology community has been pro-actively engaged in issuing guidelines to help clinical practice with the goal of decreasing exposure and complication risks from COVID-19 among patients with cancer. For instance, recommendations have emerged to consider on a case-by-case basis, whenever possible, options of delaying/dose reducing treatment, using lower-intensity therapy, postponing unnecessary radiological evaluations, and prioritizing telemedicine (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 168, "end": 171, "text": "(1)", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 523, "end": 526, "text": "(2)", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 701, "end": 704, "text": "(3,", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 705, "end": 707, "text": "4)", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1216, "end": 1219, "text": "(5)", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1220, "end": 1223, "text": "(6)", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1224, "end": 1227, "text": "(7)", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1228, "end": 1231, "text": "(8)", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1232, "end": 1235, "text": "(9)", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "INTRODUCTION"}, {"text": "Hematologic malignancies encompass a wide range of neoplasms, including leukemia, lymphoma, multiple myeloma, myelodysplastic syndrome and myeloproliferative neoplasms, which all account for 10% of all malignancies (10) .

However, the relative contribution of cancer or cancer therapy to their infectious risk of COVID-19 is uncertain given that the majority of patients either had a remote history of cancer, were not on active anticancer therapy, and/or had multiple comorbidities.

Reasons for this higher risk are multifactorial (Table 1) . First, hematologic malignancies are directly tied to an immunocompromised status due to humoral and cellular immune dysfunction (17) (18) (19) (20) . Second, a large number of therapies employed for hematologic malignancies are highly immunosuppressive, even more than standard chemotherapies used for solid tumors. Examples include myelosuppressive chemotherapy for acute leukemia, conditioning regimens for hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT), prolonged use of steroids, lymphodepleting agents used for chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy, and radiation therapy. Third, a high proportion of patients with active hematologic malignancies, especially when on active therapy, are constantly exposed to medical facilities and healthcare staff, which puts them at higher exposure risk. This includes frequent travels and visits for outpatient infusional therapies, laboratory checks or transfusions, longer infusions of certain therapies (anti-CD20 antibodies in lymphoma, daratumumab in multiple myeloma), and the need for hospitalization for other therapies (e.g., induction chemotherapy for acute leukemia). Fourth, many hematologic malignancies occur in older patients (median ages in multiple myeloma, CLL, acute myeloid leukemia, follicular lymphoma, and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma are 72, 70, 68, 65, and 64 years, respectively) with multiple coexisting comorbidities (cardiovascular and lung diseases), which are among the highest risk factors for COVID-19-related morbidity and mortality in large Chinese cohorts (4, 15, 21) . Fifth, clinical care for patients with hematologic malignancies requires more medical resources (equipment and staff) than for other patients due to the high risk nature of their diseases such as the need for frequent and close monitoring, transfusion burden, high rate of elective and urgent hospital admissions, and crucial need for clinical trial enrollment. Therefore, as clusters of outbreaks can overwhelm the healthcare system capacity, the detrimental effect may be even more pronounced on patients with hematologic malignancies. Sixth and last, many patients with hematologic malignancies may be directly harmed by travel restrictions affecting delivery of crucial therapies such as stem cells and CAR products from unrelated donors (22, 23) . On the other hand, a large proportion of patients with hematologic malignancies, especially acute leukemia or transplant candidates/recipients have been adopting social distancing and preventative precautious measures regardless of the COVID-19 crisis, which may have reduced their exposure risk of COVID-19. Moreover, some targeted therapies commonly used in hematologic malignancies, particularly JAK-STAT pathway inhibitors and bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitors (e.g., ibrutinib), have been postulated to have a protective effect in decreasing virus infectivity (24) and abrogating cytokinemediated lung injury, respectively (25) . Clinical trials are ongoing to further investigate the role of such therapies in patients with COVID-19 (NCT04375397, NCT04320277).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 261, "end": 265, "text": "(16)", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 456, "end": 460, "text": "(17)", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 461, "end": 465, "text": "(18)", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 466, "end": 470, "text": "(19)", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 471, "end": 475, "text": "(20)", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 1867, "end": 1870, "text": "(4,", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1871, "end": 1874, "text": "15,", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 1875, "end": 1878, "text": "21)", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 2623, "end": 2627, "text": "(22,", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 2628, "end": 2631, "text": "23)", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 3199, "end": 3203, "text": "(24)", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 3262, "end": 3266, "text": "(25)", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 316, "end": 325, "text": "(Table 1)", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}], "section": "RISK FACTORS FOR COVID-19 IN PATIENTS WITH HEMATOLOGIC MALIGNANCIES"}, {"text": "To our knowledge, at the time of writing this review, only 10 cases of COVID-19 have been published to date in the English literature in patients with hematologic malignancies.

Due to limited testing and screening, little information is known about the incidence of asymptomatic carriers, who maybe as contagious as symptomatic patients (30) (31) (32) . Efforts have been made to triage COVID-19 patients to separate units in order to avoid inpatient cross-contamination to other patients, thus, highlighting the importance of screening strategies. Additional testing strategies have been rapidly developed to better identify patients with COVID-19. Since SARS-CoV-2 is an RNA-virus, reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is the obvious diagnostic test to confirm virus shedding (33) . However, the sub-optimal sensitivity has limited its reliability in clinical practice. The test can be obtained from nasopharyngeal swabs or sputum samples, and results are generally reported within 4-48 h (34). Nasopharyngeal swabs may lack sensitivity after the first week of COVID-19 infection due to the natural history of the disease. The virus was shown to transiently infect the upper respiratory system until it spreads more toward the lungs. This is extrapolated from data showing a higher rate of RT-PCR positivity > 90% on days 1-3 of illness, vs. < 80% at day 6, and vs. < 50% after day 14 (35) . False negatives can also be attributed to the poor quality of the specimen and type of specimen obtained (36) . Another appealing screening strategy is serologic testing of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies to identify persons that are potentially \"immune\" and thus at minimal risk of contagion or complications, both at individual and public health levels (37) . This also has important therapeutic implications by identifying potential candidates to donate blood for the preparation of convalescent plasma, an investigational product in the management of severely ill COVID-19 patients (38) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 292, "end": 296, "text": "(30)", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 297, "end": 301, "text": "(31)", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 302, "end": 306, "text": "(32)", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 753, "end": 757, "text": "(33)", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 1362, "end": 1366, "text": "(35)", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 1474, "end": 1478, "text": "(36)", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 1714, "end": 1718, "text": "(37)", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 1945, "end": 1949, "text": "(38)", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "SCREENING STRATEGIES"}, {"text": "Due to limitations associated with PCR testing, including limited testing capacity, high false-negative rates, and delays in having the results, chest imaging has emerged as a potent diagnostic tool for COVID-19. Chest radiographs have a low sensitivity in early or mild disease and therefore, are not ideal screening tools. In one study, twenty percent of patients had normal chest radiographs at any point during the course of their illness (39) . In contrast, chest computed tomography (CT) scan is more sensitive, especially in the presence of typical findings, such as bilateral, peripheral patchy ground-glass opacities, predominantly in the lower lobes (33, 40, 41) . Although the American College of Radiology recommends that chest CT scan be reserved for symptomatic patients with suspected COVID-19-related complications and discourages its use for screening purposes, these guidelines may not be applicable for patients with cancer, especially hematologic malignancies undergoing immunosuppressive therapies (42) . Since many radiological findings may be seen with other etiologies such as opportunistic infections or drug-induced pneumonitis, the role of radiologists is primordial in confirming diagnosis of COVID-19 (43) . Vascular thickening, and peripheral distribution seem to be more characteristic of COVID-19 than other viral infections (44) . The concordance between PCR and CT scan has been addressed in a Chinese cohort from the Wuhan region of 1,014 patients with suspected COVID-19. Ninety-seven percent of patients had positive CT scans. However, important observations were notable. Initially, CT scan was more sensitive in detecting early infections (88%, compared with 59% with PCR). Moreover, CT scan was better in assessing recovery; 42% had signs of radiological improvement before RT-PCR turned negative (33) . Therefore, CT scan may have a higher yield than PCR for diagnosis and monitoring. Similar findings were shown by Fang et al. (40) (chest CT sensitivity of 98 vs. 71% with PCR; p < 0.001).

Artificial intelligence (AI) techniques may increase the sensitivity and specificity of imaging tools to screen for COVID-19 infections (46) . Deep learning techniques have been successfully used to differentiate bacterial and viral infections with specific lung injuries, suggesting that it could be a promising tool for the diagnosis and screening of COVID-19 (47, 48) . AI can improve image acquisition through automation of the scanning procedure and reshaping of the workflow, which would limit the human-to-human contact and avoid virus transmission. These techniques can also increase the accuracy of the COVID-19 diagnosis through the delineation of suspected infection on chest CT scan and radiography with different segmentation methods (49) .

The outbreak has added a large burden to the complexity of cancer care in hematologic malignancies on many aspects. Balancing the management of COVID-19 and its complications and management of cancer is particularly challenging in patients with hematologic malignancies, especially when treating with curative intent, which is often the case in many blood cancers. In the context of limited available scientific data in a such young and rapidly evolving field, physicians are left for now with their clinical judgement, educated guesses and consensual expert opinions (Figure 1) . Until the advent of effective anti-viral therapy or vaccines, preventative behavioral strategy remains our best model to help protect our patients. Screening for asymptomatic carriers and immune persons has a central role in optimizing mitigation strategy to maintain safety at individual and public health levels.
