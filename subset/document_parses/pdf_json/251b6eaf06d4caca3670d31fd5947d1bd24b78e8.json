            "text": "Daily-life conversation relies on speech perception in quiet and noise. Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, face masks have become mandatory in many situations. Acoustic attenuation of sound pressure by the mask tissue reduces speech perception ability, especially in noisy situations. Masks also can impede the process of speech comprehension by concealing the movements of the mouth, interfering with lip reading. In this prospective observational, cross-sectional study including 17 participants with normal hearing, we measured the influence of acoustic attenuation caused by medical face masks (mouth and nose protection) according to EN 14683 and of N95 masks according to EN 1149 (EN 14683) on the speech recognition threshold and listening effort in various types of background noise. Averaged over all noise signals, a surgical mask significantly reduced the speech perception threshold in noise was by 1.6 dB (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.0, 2.1) and an N95 mask reduced it significantly by 2.7 dB (95% CI, 2.2, 3.2). Use of a surgical mask did not significantly increase the 50% listening effort signal-to-noise ratio (increase of 0.58 dB; 95% CI, 0.4, 1.5), but use of an N95 mask did so significantly, by 2.2 dB (95% CI, 1.2, 3.1). In acoustic measures, mask tissue reduced amplitudes by up to 8 dB at frequencies above 1 kHz, whereas no reduction was observed below 1 kHz. We conclude that face masks reduce speech perception and increase listening effort in different noise signals. Together with additional interference because of impeded lip reading, the compound effect of face masks could have a relevant impact on daily life communication even in those with normal hearing.",

Access to lip reading cues has a positive effect on speech understanding in background noise, especially for people who have hearing impairment [8] . The speech reception threshold (SRT) in background noise can be improved by 3-5 dB if the face is visible [9, 10] .",

Simple medical masks, such as those used in operating rooms, reduce the spoken language level by 3-4 dB in the high-frequency range of 2000-7000 Hz, and N95 masks reduce the level by about 12 dB [11] . A decrease of 12 dB has also been measured for surgical masks [12] . Although speaking through face masks alters the speech signal, some specific features of voice quality features (e.g., harmonic-to-noise ratio, temporal pattern) remain largely unaffected [13] . The sound pressure level of spoken language is reduced mainly at frequencies \ufffd2000 Hz, so that the resulting signal would be similar to that for listeners having who have slight high-frequency hearing loss [14] . In a recent study of health workers, the speech perception threshold was increased by 12.4 dB if the speaker used an N95 mask and a face shield [15] .",

However, studies making this assessment did not measure the speech perception threshold (SRT) in noise, i.e., the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) that results in 50% speech recognition. SRT is widely used in the clinical routine as a sensitive diagnostic tool. In this study, we used the Oldenburg sentence test (OLSA), which presents lists of unpredictable fiveword sentences (name-verb-numeral-adjective-object) to the listener in a background masker with different SNRs [18] . Depending on the number of words (score) correctly repeated by the listener, the SNR is increased or decreased for the subsequent sentence presentation. The adaptive procedure converges on the SNR that corresponds to a 50% correct score, defined as SRT 50 .",

In hearing-impaired listeners, speech perception in noise would be more affected by face mask-related declines in sound pressure levels because of the reduced amplification by the outer hair cells, resulting in a smaller dynamic range [6, 8, 19, 20] . In hearing-impaired individuals, speech perception in noise also is reduced to an increased pure-tone threshold in quiet [21, 22] , mainly attributable to a reduced cochlear amplifier function. Other than in conductive hearing loss, hearing aids can compensate only partially for impaired hair cell function. Therefore, reduced speech level in noise would particularly affect daily life communication in hearing-impaired listeners. For such \"pseudo hearing impairment\", hearing amplifiers that compensate for these deficits are required, especially for vulnerable occupational groups and social groups [23] . Specific recommendations for educational settings also aim to compensate for the negative aspects of mouth and nose protection [24] .",

Those studies used live voice, whereas studies using audio-only recordings made with medical masks showed no significant effects on speech intelligibility [6, 16, 17] .

Spectral differences in recordings with a surgical mask (bold lines) or an N95 mask (thin lines) for all used noise signals compared with the unmasked recordings. At frequencies above 1 kHz, some mask tissue reduced the amplitudes by up to 8 dB. A surgical mask reduced the amplitudes at frequencies above 2 kHz, but a reduction was already measurable at frequencies already above 1 kHz for the N95 mask. The current findings indicate that a face mask induced SRT reductions consistently across three different noise types. Without a mask between the speaker and the listener, the measured SRT was better than the normative range of the used speech-in-noise test for signal and noise both presented from the front (S 0 N 0 ) [18] . Use of masks still resulted in SRTs being within that reference value range. In daily life situations, the noise source is not fixed and would potentially be in front of the listener in many scenarios. In such cases, the baseline SRT would already be worse as compared to the used configuration with noise from behind (S 0 N 180 ). Because only the speech signals would be affected by a face mask in those situations, speechin-noise perception SRTs would be even lower, i.e., worse, than measured in the present study.",

The face masks increased the absolute threshold (SNR cut ) of the hearing effort function, which reflects increased listening effort. The observed effect of the masks on listening effort was of the same magnitude as the speech perception threshold in noise. Low-pass filtering, such as that caused by face masks, would be expected to reduce the audibility of high-frequency portions of spoken speech, such as consonants and sibilants, or at least to increase the listening effort. Face masks increase the effort that the speaker must make, as well, with symptoms of vocal fatigue, discomfort, and coordination of speech and breathing [30] . To the listener, an increased communication effort would therefore be expected because of the face masks and alter the interpersonal components of communication.",

The reported acoustic measurements, however, showed a clear modification of speech signals, which can explain the observed subjective results. An influence of habituation and training on the SRT of the matrix test we used was reduced by randomizing the experimental conditions and starting with training lists. In daily life, the sight of a speaker who uses a face mask could potentially increase the subjective perceived listening effort because of the missing lip reading and other visual, e.g. emotional cues of face-to-face communication. The results of this study, however, showed no evidence for an increased listening effort because of the masks alone.",

Distributions of speech perception in noise SRT 50 for the Oldenburg Sentence Test (OLSA) presenting speech and noise signals from a female speaker (A) and a male speaker (B), or a female speaker in International Speech Test Signal (ISTS) (C).
