This decision allowed the implementation of vaccination programs against COVID-19 in the EU Member States. According to the EU Vaccines Strategy, the EU Member States launched the joint purchase of COVID-19 vaccines to secure supplies and facilitate the rollout of vaccines [2] . The European Commission has signed the Advance Purchase Agreements with individual COVID-19 vaccine producers on behalf of Member States, wherein the volume of orders was proportional to the number of inhabitants of individual EU Member States [3] . According to the EU Vaccines Strategy, by summer 2021, Member States should have vaccinated a minimum of 70% of the entire adult population, in order to achieve herd immunity [2] [3] [4] . While vaccine deliveries depended on the EU Agreements, the organization of COVID-19 vaccination programs, methods of promotion as well as priority groups for COVID-19 vaccination differed between EU Member States [2, 4] .",

The Program specified the rules of vaccination and places in which the vaccination was to take place as well as the order of vaccination of individual subpopulations [4] . The rules of the Program have changed with the new EMA recommendations as well as the recommendations of the national public health authorities [1, 5] . In Poland, the healthcare and social workers were among the first to be vaccinated against COVID-19 in Poland. On 27 December 2020, the first Polish citizen-a nurse from the largest COVID-19-dedicated hospital-was vaccinated against COVID-19 [6] . In January 2021, an age-based program was applied. Vaccination of older adults began on 25 January 2021, with priority for registration for people over 80 years of age. In the following weeks, individual age groups (by year of birth) had an opportunity to register for COVID-19 vaccination. On 10 May 2021, all Polish inhabitants aged 18 and over could register for a COVID-19 vaccination [4, 5] .",

Moreover, in Poland, there is a formalized and structured anti-vaccination movement, which tries to abolish mandatory childhood vaccination. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the anti-vaccination movement also questioned the importance and safety of vaccination against COVID-19 [9, 10] . Identification of the factors associated with negative attitudes towards the COVID-19 vaccine will allow for the implementation of educational activities that build confidence in vaccination. Moreover, these data may be the basis for identifying best practices in the promotion of vaccination against COVID-19 in EU countries, with particular emphasis on the Central and Eastern Europe.",

Negative attitudes towards the COVID-19 vaccine were also relatively frequent in the group of people with three or more children-(51%; 95% CI: 38.2-65.7%).

This political party is the only political party in the Polish Parliament (Sejm) that publicly supports the anti-vaccination movement in Poland [12] . The leaders of the anti-vaccine movement took part in the 2019 parliamentary elections with the support of this right-wing political party (joint slate) [9, 12] . Moreover, political leaders of this political party publicly denied the importance of anti-epidemic measures to mitigate the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infections and presented negative attitudes towards vaccination against COVID-19, which may cause vaccine hesitancy among inhabitants of Poland. Our analyses did not reveal any associations between the support of other political parties and the negative attitudes towards COVID-19 vaccines. Our findings confirm the significance of the impact that politicians' statements have on social attitudes towards vaccination against COVID- 19. This study showed that living in rural areas or cities below 100,000 inhabitants was associated with higher odds of refusing the COVID-19 vaccination. This observation may result from the fact that due to the population density, level of urbanization and industrialization, the number of COVID-19 cases and COVID-19-related deaths reported in rural areas and smaller towns was lower compared with large urban centers [13, 14] . Due to the differences in the dynamics of COVID-19 pandemic between rural and urban areas, the percentage of respondents who declare fear of COVID-19 and subsequent willingness to vaccinate against COVID-19 among those who lived in these areas may be lower than that among inhabitants of large cities, where the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection (e.g., in public transport or in a shop) seems to be higher [15] .",

We can hypothesize, that misinformation about vaccinations, the presence of new variants of the virus, with reduced vaccine effectiveness, and the lack of fear of coronavirus, especially during the holiday season in Poland (June-August), resulted in lower uptake of the COVID-19 vaccine than declared in April, when the third wave of the COVID-19 pandemic peaked.",
