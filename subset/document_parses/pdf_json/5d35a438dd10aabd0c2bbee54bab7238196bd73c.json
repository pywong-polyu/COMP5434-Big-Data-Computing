            "text": "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID- 19) , an infectious disease caused by a novel coronavirus (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 or SARS-CoV-2), has created an unprecedented global health and economic crisis. By the end of 2020, confirmed COVID-19 cases surpassed 84 million globally, resulting in over 1.8 million deaths. COVID-19 patients can experience a range of manifestations, from being asymptomatic, to having mild, moderate, severe symptoms, to having a critical illness. Growing evidence shows that COVID-19 is a vascular illness, not solely a respiratory disease. Histopathological examinations of post-mortem tissues of COVID-19 patients have revealed (1) diffuse alveolar damage with perivascular infiltration of inflammatory cells [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] , (2) extensive damage to the lining of blood vessels throughout the body 6-8 , (3) severe endothelial injury and widespread thrombosis in the lungs, heart, liver, kidney, and small intestine 1,5-8 , (4) viral particles in endothelial cells (ECs) of the glomerular capillary loops 6 , and (5) caspase-3-positive apoptotic ECs in the lung and intestine tissues 6 . In addition, a recent study has shown that COVID-19 patients in intensive care units (ICUs) have higher counts of circulating ECs (CECs) than non-ICU patients 9 . CECs are stressed cells detached from injured blood vessels, thereby indicating severe vascular injury 10 .",

Elevated circulating concentrations of IL-6, IFN-\u03b3, IL-8, IL-18, TGF-\u03b2, IP-10, MCP-1, and MIG have been reported in SARS patients when compared with healthy controls (HCs) 20, 21 . Circulating IL-6 levels are also elevated in COVID-19 patients and are cited as evidence of COVID- 19 CCS 22, 23 . However, the levels of IL-6 and other inflammatory cytokines such as IL-8 are significantly less elevated in patients with critical COVID-19 than the values typically reported in patients with CSS such as septic shock with and without acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) 24 . Indeed, the concentrations of IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-\u03b1, three of the most important inflammatory mediators in human diseases with CSS 25 , in COVID- 19 patients are similar to those found in ICU patients with cardiac arrest or trauma, conditions that are not notable for cytokine storms 24 . These findings bring into question whether a cytokine storm occurs in COVID-19, and whether IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-\u03b1 act as key inflammatory mediators for fatal manifestations in patients with severe or critical COVID-19 25 . Our results echo recent NIH guidelines that note there are insufficient data to recommend IL-6 inhibitors for the treatment of COVID-19 26 . In fact, efforts to combat cytokine storm in patients with severe COVID-19 have proven unsuccessful 27 .",

Viral entry is also facilitated by transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) and neuropilin-1 (NRP1) 31, 33, 34 . ACE2, TMPRSS2, and NRP1 are highly abundant on the lung alveolar type II epithelial (AT2) cells, rendering AT2 cells highly susceptible to productive SARS-CoV-2 infection 33, [35] [36] [37] . ACE2, TMPRSS2, and NRP1 are also expressed on the surface of ECs 33, 35, [38] [39] [40] , albeit at lower levels than in AT2 cells 33 , suggesting that these molecules may facilitate direct SARS-CoV-2 infection of ECs. Indeed, SARS-CoV-2 particles were observed in ECs in kidney tissues from COVID-19 patients 8 . However, a recent unreferenced preprint reported that ECs derived from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), human lung microvascular ECs, and human aortic ECs did not have detectable mRNA of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 and were resistant to SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro 41 . Although this study shows results that are not consistent with both their own report 42 and previous studies 33, 35, [38] [39] [40] , it highlights the need for further research on the pathogenic mechanisms underlying vascular injury in COVID-19.",

Surprisingly, matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1) and vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A), not conventional inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, were two of the most unambiguously elevated inflammatory factors in hospitalized COVID-19 patients when compared to mild/moderate cases or HCs. Spearman correlation analysis revealed that the plasma levels of MMP-1 and VEGF-A in hospitalized COVID-19 patients were positively correlated, suggesting that there may be an interaction between MMP-1 and VEGF-A in COVID-19. Given that excessive MMP-1 plays a central role in tissue destruction in a wide variety of vascular diseases and that elevated VEGF-A, an EC activation markers, increases vascular permeability 43 , we further studied MMP-1 enzymatic activity and other EC activation markers including soluble forms of CD146, intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1), and vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1) in our cohort of COVID-19 patients and HCs. We performed correlation analysis among plasma levels of MMP-1, EC activation markers, and inflammatory cytokines/chemokines, MMP-1 enzymatic activity, and patients' demographics and clinical parameters. We found that excessive MMP-1 and hyperactivation of ECs occurred in COVID-19 patients and were correlated with the severity of COVID-19.",

The term \"cytokine storm\" was first coined to describe the excessive release of inflammatory cytokines by immune cells in graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) 49, 54, 55 . Since then, CSS has been reported in a wide range of other human diseases including cancer patients undergoing chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy 56, 57 , pancreatitis 58 , multiple organ dysfunction syndrome 59 69 . In HCs, mean levels of circulating IL-6 have been reported to be <5 pg/mL 70 , which can be increased to >10,000 pg/mL in cancer patients on CAR T cell therapy 69 . The substantial elevation of IL-6 and its correlation with disease severity have resulted in IL-6 inhibitors such as sarilumab, siltuximab, and tocilizumab becoming therapeutic agents that can effectively treat CSS-associated diseases 69, 71 . Circulating IL-6 levels are also elevated in COVID-19 patients and is cited as evidence of COVID- 19 CCS 22, 23, 66, [72] [73] [74] [75] [76] [77] [78] . However, as previously reported, elevated IL-6 levels in COVID-19 patients are minuscule compared to those found in individuals on CAR T cell therapy and other CSS-associated diseases 25 , suggesting that IL-6 does not act as a key inflammatory mediator for fatal manifestations in patients with severe or critical COVID-19 25 . In line with this finding, IL-6 inhibitors are not recommended to be used as therapeutic agents for the treatment of COVID-19 as noted by NIH guidelines 26 . Our results provide evidence that explains why efforts to combat cytokine storm have proven unsuccessful in severe COVID-19 patients.

The risk for severe illness with COVID-19 increases with age, with older adults at highest risk 53 . Other demographic factors such as gender and race have been also linked with risk for the severity of COVID-19 illness. We found that excessive MMPs and/or circulating markers of EC activation increased with age or were higher in hospitalized male COVID-19 patients (Figure 3 ), but not affected by race ( Figure 3 ). However, we realize that our sample size of hospitalized COVID-19 patients, after splitting into 2 demographic groups, is too small to make statistical inferences.

Spearman correlation analysis revealed that the plasma levels of MMP-1 and VEGF-A in hospitalized COVID-19 patients were positively correlated (Figure 1B), suggesting interactions between MMP-1 and VEGF-A in COVID-19. MMP-1 is an interstitial collagenase capable of degrading collagen types I, II, and III, and plays a critical role in vascular remodeling and vascular diseases 79,80 . In addition, MMP-1 acts as a potent agonist for protease-activated receptor-1 (PAR1) 81 , a G protein-coupled protease-activated receptor, on the surface of a variety of cell types such as ECs 81-83 , platelets 81,84,85 , and macrophages 86,87 . MMP-1/PAR1 signaling plays a paramount role in EC function 81-83 . Hyperactivation of MMP-1/PAR1 signaling in ECs leads to a decreased endothelial barrier function and promotes adhesion of inflammatory cells to ECs 88-90 . MMP-1/PAR1 signaling can increase expression of VEGF receptor-2 (VEGFR2) 91 , the main receptor for VEGF-A 92 , on ECs. The increased VEGFR2 binds VEGF-A, resulting in increased activation of ECs. We found that the levels of MMP-1, VEGF-A, and MMP-1 enzymatic activity were significantly elevated in the peripheral blood in hospitalized (severe/critical) COVID-19 patients compared to mild/moderate cases or HCs (Figure 2), suggesting that MMP-1/PAR1/VEGFR2/VEGF-A signaling may be in a hyperactivation state in ECs in COVID-19",

Thus, there is an urgent need to study the profile, expression, and activity of MMPs in SARS-CoV-2 infection and the role of excessive MMPs in the pulmonary and systemic endothelialitis and vascular injury in COVID-19 patients.
