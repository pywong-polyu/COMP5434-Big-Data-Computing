This study was designed to determine the potential of transfusion-transmitted malaria (TTM) by detecting malaria antigens and parasites in recipients of infected donor blood. After successful blood transfusion, remnants of transfused blood were screened for Plasmodium falciparum HRP2 antigen and parasitemia using CareStart malaria RDT and 10% Giemsa stain microscopy respectively according to established protocols. Recipients of microscopy detectable P. falciparum in infected blood who tested negative for malaria by both microscopy and mRDT prior to receiving infected donor blood were followed up weekly for 35 days. Donor P. falciparum antigenemia and parasitemia were 12.1% and 8.4%, respectively, while the prevalence of blood recipient parasitemia was 3.2%. Blood stored for 2-5 days recorded mean parasitemia higher than those stored for a day and after 5 days. Additionally, parasitemia was observed in all follow-up days with marginally high frequencies in days 7, 14, and 35. There was no association between the attributes (storage days, blood group, and parasite count range) of the infected donor blood units and the characteristics of blood recipients with post-transfusion parasitemia. This study provides baseline data on TTM in Ghana. However, further studies should establish the genetic relatedness of the implicated parasites since new infections and/or recrudescence of previous infections could account for this observation.",

Due to this gap in blood transfusion practice, several studies have reported varying prevalence rates of Plasmodium sp. infection in either prospective blood donors or donor blood units, across the world (Owusu-Ofori et al. 2016; Oladeinde et al. 2014; Alemu and Mama 2018) . P. falciparum, P. vivax, P. malariae, and P. ovale have been detected in blood donors, hence implicated in transfusion-transmitted malaria (TTM) (Kitchen et al. 2005) . These blood donors are most likely to harbor these malaria parasites, albeit at low densities (Faruk et al. 2017) , which could later be transfused to patients, who may require transfusion. Most blood transfusion recipients, including pregnant women, children under 5 years of age, and immunocompromised patients, are vulnerable and susceptible to severe forms of any infection, including P. falciparum, hence at higher risk of TTM.",

For this reason, the parasite could establish an infection in a recipient of such infected blood, if the recipient had no or partial immunity to the parasite (Ademolue and Awandare 2018).

Therefore, this study was designed to determine the proportion of recipients of donor blood units contaminated with microscopically detectable P. falciparum that developed malaria parasitemia within 35 days of receiving such unit(s) of donor blood and to determine the attributes, namely, storage days, blood group, and parasite count range, of donor blood units that resulted in recipient parasitemia on follow-up testing.",

P. falciparum antigenemia and parasitemia were observed in all blood types, although at varying frequencies, except blood type A negative. In all cases, P. falciparum microscopy agreed with P. falciparum HRP2 antigenemia. Twenty-four (68.6%) of the 35 donor blood units of blood group O positive blood type were positive by microscopy. Regarding blood group A positive, 9 (75%) of the 12 donor units with P. falciparum antigenemia were positive microscopically. Similarly, 7 (58.3%) of the 12 of the donor blood type B positive with P. falciparum antigenemia were positive by microscopy. All numbers of donor blood units with blood groups O negative and B negative to P. falciparum antigenemia were positive microscopically. Majority of donor blood units were whole blood (92.5%); the rest were concentrated red blood cells. The prevalence of P. falciparum antigenemia and parasitemia in the whole blood units was 62 (10.9%) and 45 (7.9%), respectively. The prevalence was lower in concentrated red blood cells, where 7 (1.2%) and 3 (0.5%) P. falciparum antigenemia and parasitemia were found, respectively. Over 90% (528/571) of the donor blood units were banked for just one day. While 83 (14.5%) donor units were banked for between 2 -5 days, 36 (6.3%) donor units were banked for more than 5 days. Prevalence of P. falciparum antigenemia and parasitemia in donor blood stored for 1 day was 9.1% and 6.5% respectively. Blood banking for 2-5 days yielded a prevalence of 1.9% and 1.2% for P. falciparum antigenemia and parasitemia, respectively. P. falciparum antigenemia and parasitemia prevalence reduced with prolonged storage. P. falciparum parasitemia was not detected after 18 days of storage (Table 1) .",

            "text": "This study provides preliminary evidence of probable transfusion-transmitted malaria (TTM) among recipients of Plasmodium falciparum-infected donor blood. This baseline data is essential because Plasmodium sp. infection is common in blood donors and donor blood units, especially in donors from malaria endemic regions (Garba et al. 2016; Antwi-Baffour et al. 2019; Schindler et al. 2019 ). This causes the presence of P. falciparum in donor blood units with possible transmission to blood recipients, if the contaminated blood is not excluded from clinical use (Olawumi et al. 2015) . Individuals mostly at risk of TTM are blood recipients living in malaria nonendemic regions with partial or no anti-parasite immunity (Verra et al. 2018) . It is in view of the foregoing that this study was done to assess malaria parasitemia in recipients of P. falciparum-infected donor blood. It is reported herein that 14 out of 48 recipients of infected donor blood with microscopically detectable malaria parasites developed malaria parasitemia; hence, TTM is suspected in these blood recipients. Majority of the recipients with microscopically detectable malaria parasitemia received donor blood that were stored for only a day (71.4%) and donor blood of group O rhesus D positive (50%). Interestingly, even though the recipients received various quantities of malaria parasites, the majority of the post-transfusion infection was observed in recipients of parasites within the range 100-499 million parasites per unit of blood (57.1%) compared to donor units of contaminating parasites of 500 million or more. It is not surprising to observe that blood stored for just a day yielded P. falciparum parasitemia in most of the recipients. This is because P. falciparum has been reported to remain intact for up to 28 days but viability is lost after 14 days storage at 4 \u00b0C (Chattopadhyay et al. 2011 ). However, it was intriguing to observe that mean parasitemia in the donor blood was higher in 2-5 days of storage compared to mean levels after storage for a day. Although marginally, this observation may be due to the vast differences in the baseline parasitemia levels (which was not possible to determine in this study since the remainder of donor blood was used for this study). However, parasitemia was significantly reduced in donor blood stored for over 5 days. Reduction in parasitemia after 5 days of blood storage at 4 \u00b0C has previously been reported (Chattopadhyay et al. 2011) . It is currently unknown why transfusion of high quantities of parasites per unit of blood did not correspond to high infectivity in the recipients. Regardless of that, most of the recipients with suspected TTM were females (87.5%), recipients with blood group O (53.1%), and anemic recipients (65.6%). Though, post-transfusion parasitemia did not statistically associate with these variables. In contrast to the findings in this study, males have been reported to be more susceptible to infectious diseases than females (Klein 2000; Altamimi et al. 2020; Bunders and Altfeld 2020; Migliore et al. 2021 ). The only attributable reason to this observation of the high incidence of P. falciparum infection in female blood recipients was that disproportionately more female blood recipients than male blood recipients were encountered during the study. Despite the lack of association with post-transfusion parasitemia, there is an attempt to provide reasons why posttransfusion malaria parasitemia was disproportionately higher in anemic patients. This observation could be due to compromised immunity associated with anemia. Hassan et al. 2016 reported significantly lower IgG levels, IL-6, and phagocytic activity in anemic patients. Similarly, it has also been established that anemia, especially iron deficiency anemia, increases susceptibility to infectious diseases (Beard 2001) . Individuals with blood groups A and B were found to be highly susceptible to P. falciparum infection in several studies (Panda et al. 2011; Afoakwah et al. 2016) . However, in this study, the frequency of incidence of P. falciparum infection was found to be high in blood group O. This could be due to the high number of blood recipients of blood group O (49.5%). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the mean parasitemia in blood recipients of blood group O was less than that in recipients of group A (2068 vs. 3859 parasites/\u00b5L of blood). This confirms that blood group A is very susceptible to P. falciparum infection than blood group O (Panda et al. 2011; Afoakwah et al. 2016 ).",

This could mean that P. falciparum established infection as soon as transfusion was completed while others delayed until after a month. This observation could be possible since, unlike P. falciparum transmission through mosquito bites, infected blood transfusions directly release the malaria parasite in the recipient's bloodstream (Garraud 2006 ) and within 8-29 days later, which is the incubation period for TTM (Dover and Schultz 1971), TTM could occur. For this reason, detection of malaria parasites up to 35 days is not impossible. Because as few as 10 infected red blood cells have been shown to be infectious (Verra et al. 2018) , hence, transfusion of a mean parasitemia of over 600 million parasites in an infected donor blood could be potentially infectious as observed in this study.",

This implies that donor P. falciparum contamination could potentially be transmitted to all categories of blood recipients.

Even though all infected blood recipients were negative by mRDT, the technique has been found not to be able to detect P. falciparum antigens in infections with parasitemia less than 50 parasites/\u00b5L of blood (Wongsrichanalai et al. 2007; Okell et al. 2009 ).
