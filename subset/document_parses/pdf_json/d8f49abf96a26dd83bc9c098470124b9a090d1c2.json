These individuals, and some younger adults with inherently short HCTL, might be at a higher risk of developing COVID-19 T-cell lymphopenia and severe disease.",

(iii) A single na\u00ffve T cell can clonally expand and through 20 successive replications it generates a maximal CS (MCS) of 2 20 (\u00bb one million) memory T cells; this value was estimated based on the \u00bb 1.4 kb TL difference between circulating na\u00ffve and memory T cells and the \u00bb 0.07 kb telomere shortening per replication of T cells. 23 (iv) Most memory T cells are formed in response to new antigens during childhood and early adulthood, 24 when HCTL is comparatively long, 25\u00c027 enabling the achievement of MCS. (v) Due to age-dependent TL shortening, a na\u00ffve T-cell TL reaches the \"telomeric onset\" (TL O = 6.4 kb) at \"age of onset\" (X O ). Until X O , a na\u00ffve T cell can generate MCS. After X O , a na\u00ffve T cell can generate only a limited clonal size (LCS < MCS), as the TL of the clonal cells converges to the TL B . Table 1 displays the parameters used to construct the model and examine its ramifications. We denote the maximal TL shortening due to clonal expansion as D max and the TL shortening per replication as r. We define CS by the number (N) of T-cell replications producing CS \u00bc 2 N . As a clone expands, telomeres of its T cells progressively shorten, i.e., D \u00bc rN, where r is the telomere shortening due to T-cell replication. Prior to X O , the maximum number of T-cell replications in clonal expansion is N max \u00bc D max =r \u00bc 20. After X O , the number of T-cell replications in clonal expansion is N \u00bc \u00f0TL X \u00c0 TL B \u00de=r, where X designates age and the corresponding age-dependent TL of a na\u00ffve T cell is TL X \u00bc TL 20 \u00c0 g\u00f0X \u00c0 20\u00de, where g is the TL shortening in the na\u00ffve T cell each year. The resulting X O is the number of years it takes for a na\u00ffve T cell to reach TL O . These onset measures are defined:",

As TL differences among leukocyte lineages within the individual are far smaller than the inter-individual HCTL variation, 33 T-cell TL largely mirrors HCTL. Fourth, the TL signal for cessation of cell replication originates from the shortest telomeres in the nucleus and not their mean TL. 34, 35 Using the Telomeres Shortest Length Assay (TeSLA), a method that tallies and measures the shortest telomeres, 36 a recent study showed that in patients with COVID-19 the shortest telomeres in peripheral blood mononuclear cells were associated with low lymphocyte counts. 12 The principles that drive our model thus likely apply to the T cell's shortest telomeres.",

However, once X O is reached, the ability of T cells to expand clonally declines in an exponential manner, i.e., 2 20 ! 2 19 ! 2 18 ! 2 17 , etc. Since T-cell TL shortens at a pace of 0.03 kb/year and by 0.07 kb/replication, the Tcell clonal expansion capacity drops by half every 2.3 years past X O .

For instance, TL-mediated replicative ageing is probably inconsequential during the 2, 3-year lifespan of mice, (TL O = 6.4 kb), TL is insufficient to produce MCS because a full clonal expansion drops TL below the telomeric brink (TL B = 5 kb). The TL O is reached at different ages of onset (X O ), i.e., an older age for T-cells with long T-cell telomeres and younger with T-cells with short telomeres. The age-dependent T-cell TL shortening (0.03 kb/year) for T cells with mean, long, and short telomeres at TL 20 is shown by the lines. (c) shows that the T-cell CS is partitioned by the X O into plateau and slope regions. T cells with mean, long, or short TL 20 achieve MCS on the CS plateau, but their CS exponentially collapses (slope) once their TLs shorten below TL O and exceed X O (at different ages). considering their long telomeres (mean TL > 30 kb) and robust activity in their somatic cells of telomerase, the reverse transcriptase that elongates telomeres. In contrast, the average human TL at birth is only \u00bb 9.5 kb. 27 As telomerase activity is repressed in replicating human somatic cells, their short telomeres experience further age-dependent shortening after birth. Although na\u00ffve T cells have some telomerase activity, it is insufficient to prevent their age-dependent telomere shortening, and ageing may thus undermine the T-cell clonal expansion in many older humans.",

            "text": "We acknowledge limitations: The model draws on HCTL data from populations comprising principally whites of European ancestry in high-income countries. It should also be tested in populations of different ancestries and in low-and middle-income countries. That said, we anticipate that the principles of the model will hold, although the X O and TL O might shift up or down depending on specific populations and geographical regions. The TL difference between na\u00ffve T cells and memory T cells likely reflects the clonal expansion in response to not only a single encounter but multiple encounters with a given antigen and its cross-reactive antigens. Thus, the MCS and LCS definitions in absolute T-cell numbers might be off the mark. Of note, however, the MCS and LCS can be expressed in the model in relative units of MCS (i.e., 0.5 MCS, 0.25 MCS, etc.) rather than absolute units (numbers of T cells), yielding identical results. Therefore, the principles of our model are likely to hold notwithstanding the above limitations. Finally, our model focuses on telomere length dynamics in limiting T-cell clonal expansion through mechanisms that trigger replicative senescence. However, independent mechanisms might limit T-cell clonal expansion through pathways that lead to T-cell exhaustion. Typically, this exhaustion is associated with the upregulation of the programmed cell death (PD-1) pathway, 54 but de novo DNA-methylation might also promote T cell exhaustion. 55 In conclusion, while our model is clearly an oversimplification, it highlights an overlooked effect of ageing within the very complex system of T-cell regulation. 53 The insight generated by our model might set the stage for measurement of TL parameters not only in older adults but also the general population, helping to identify, regardless of age, individuals vulnerable to severe COVID-19 because of short T-cell telomeres. These individuals might show, in addition, an early waning immunity after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination, facilitating the evolution of novel variants of the virus. 56 Finally, the ramifications of these conclusions go beyond the influence of TL on T-cell response to SARS Cov-2 infection and vaccination against the virus. They suggest that TL might be a limiting factor in immunotherapies whose efficacies depend on clonally expanding (in vivo and in vitro) transplanted hematopoietic cells, chimeric antigen receptor T cells, and tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes.",
