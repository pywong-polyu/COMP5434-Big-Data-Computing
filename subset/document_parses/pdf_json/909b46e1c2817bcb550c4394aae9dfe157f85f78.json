Here we describe our experience and assess the quality of an online training format based on participant outcomes for the first three modules of a planned series of online ART training. Materials and Methods: Materials and Methods: These modules included manual semen analysis, sperm morphology and ancillary semen tests (testing for leukocytospermia, sperm vitality, and anti-sperm antibody screening). The virtual format consisted of lecture presentations featuring laboratory protocols with corresponding video demonstrations of routine techniques and best practices. Practical scenarios, troubleshooting, and clinical interpretation of laboratory results were also discussed. At the end of each module, an optional multiple choice question test was held as a prerequisite to obtain certification on the topics presented. Course quality was assessed using participant responses collected via online surveys.

In the United States alone, infertility affects 9.5% of men [2] . The clinical evaluation of male infertility is based on the semen analysis where the results can significantly influence the diagnostic interpretation and management. While many clinicians rely on semen parameters as a surrogate marker of a man's ability to father a child, the results of semen analysis should, however, be interpreted with caution considering its inherent limitations [3, 4] .",

            "text": "A properly performed semen analysis and an adequate clinical examination of the male along with questions regarding current medical conditions and lifestyle circumstances that could affect sample quality, can provide valuable information related to a man's fertility potential. This information facilitates a better understanding of the physiology of the reproductive organs and the underlying causes of dysfunction [5] [6] [7] . However, manual semen analysis has its inherent challenges associated with high subjectivity, lack of standardization, inadequate quality control and quality assurance, as well as inadequate assessment of competency, and training of laboratory personnel performing the test [7, 8] . Unlike sperm concentration and motility, sperm morphology has even more subjectivity in reporting the results, with increased intra-and intervariability [8] [9] [10] . Therefore, quality control is imminent in preventing such variations and retaining uniformity in all assessments by all operators. This includes preanalytical (test requisition, correct sample collection, delivery of sample), analytical (mixing and loading of sample, correct preparation of smears or calculation of results), and post-analytical (correct reporting of results to the clinician) indicators. To minimize errors, daily, weekly, or monthly quality control of reagents and equipment is imperative. It is also important to identify and document the sources of error in sperm concentration, motility, and morphology. Several factors are responsible for variation in the results of sperm morphology, including differences in the methods used to prepare and stain specimens, differences in proficiency among technicians, and inherent differences in classification criteria and methods [11] . Thus, it is essential to have step-by-step protocols (Standard Operating Procedures), conduct training, and assess the performance of laboratory personnel using proficiency testing material and test competency assessments at regular intervals [6, 12] .",

The performance of the trainee in semen analysis can be successfully evaluated by both the assessment of competency in adequately performing semen analysis and the assimilation of information delivered by multiple choice question (MCQ). In the past eighteen years that the hands-on assisted reproductive technology (ART) training program has been running at the American Center for Reproductive Medicine (ACRM), over 200 candidates from more than 45 countries have been successfully trained. ACRM's ART training program focuses on teaching candidates the newest practical techniques in both routine and advanced andrology. The Case Western Reserve University has recognized this ART training program with a Scholarship in Teaching Award. Most trainees found the program to be invaluable in terms of theoretical background and hands-on guidance, received by expert instructors at a pace that was best suited for their individual abilities.",

Similarly, the use of Dropbox for sharing written instructions, organization of practice sessions, sharing of the most frequently asked questions (FAQs), translation of the shared information into different languages, creation of short informative video clips, and voice messages were rated as either useful or very useful by more than 80% of the participants (Fig. 2) . Although sharing of information using various electronic platforms was generally rated as very good or excellent by more than 80% of the participants, the preferred platforms appeared to be WhatsApp with a rating of 86%, Dropbox (85%), and WebEx (81%) (Fig. 3) . Overall, analysis of the responses related to the technological tools used in the online ART course showed that 51.7% of participants found this program to be very useful and the digital delivery methods had completely met their purpose. Moreover, 33.0% had found these tools to be helpful and very good, although 11.9% found them neutral and good. More than 70% of the participants regarded the fol- lowing aspects of program as either very good or excellent: 1) participants' level of interest in participating in the modules, 2) experience preparing for the courses, 3) course coordinators support, 4) ability to adjust to a completely online course, 5) timing and duration of the course, 6) choice of course faculty, 7) opportunity to ask questions, 8) level of interest to participate in future courses, 9) short videos about the lecture topics, 10) lectures given by the ACRM faculty/guest speakers, 11) discussion of updates in current clinical practice, and 12) MCQ assessments to improve learning (Fig. 4) .

These pre-module reading materials were carefully curated by the ACRM for each specific module based on the importance and applicability of the resource material. There were several reasons for sharing the resources ahead of the course session. First, it allowed registered participants from mixed levels of competence to familiarize themselves with the key concepts that were going to be discussed during a particular ART training module. This approach prescribes to the cognitive load theory which describes how new learners possess a working memory with a limited capacity to process new information, while those who already have some prior knowledge on a topic advance by linking new information to pre-existing knowledge [17] . Thus, learners who are novices in a subject matter are quickly overwhelmed when exposed to vast amounts of new terminology and concepts in lectures. These learners usually end up relying on mere surface learning [18] . Moreover, having early access to the pre-module learning resources presented the participants with a sufficient window whereby to read and better understand the subject www.wjmh.org matter at their own time and convenience. This could facilitate a deeper understanding, activate the appropriate knowledge connections that the participants may have initially lacked and steer their attention towards capturing information more comprehensively during the actual online session. As such, participants who engaged with the pre-module reading material could potentially have found it 1) beneficial in making the course topics easier to understand and follow, and 2) helpful in connecting with the new concepts in a more meaningful manner [17] .",

Furthermore, only a moderate percentage of participants were from English-speaking countries. To limit this bias, the survey was extensively revised by a pool of international coordinators as well as collaborators with large experience in teaching, to make each question understandable and unambiguous to an international audience. In future, the survey questions may also be translated into the first language of the participants in order to avoid comprehension bias.",

We have shown that the online training for certain ART-related modules can be conducted by means of providing expert-led video demonstrations, power point presentations, clinical lectures, and online interactive e-learning activities. Moreover, complex issues in reproductive biology could be covered by interplay of both laboratory and clinical professionals. The application of several online-based communication tools such as WhatsApp, Dropbox and Cisco WebEx were instrumental in implementing the web-based delivery model.",

The impact of having a virtual modality in place of hands-on learning for ART laboratory professionals during the COVID-19 requires further investigation to determine its effectiveness by comparing to the traditional approach. This comparison will help improve the current strategies for teaching and learning in specialized fields like Andrology. In fact, the inclusion of the best features from both hands-on and e-learning approaches will enhance the design and the implementation of future teaching strategies.",
