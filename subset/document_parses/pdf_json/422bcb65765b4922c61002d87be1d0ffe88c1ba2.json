A patient presented a severe episode of immune thrombocytopenia (< 10 \u00d7 10 9 /L) 20 days after admission for a critical COVID-19. This thrombocytopenia was associated with a life-threatening bleeding. Response to first-line therapies was delayed as it took up to 13 days after initiation of intravenous immunoglobulin and high-dose dexamethasone to observe an increase in platelet count. COVID-19 may be associated with late presenting severe ITP. Such ITP may also be relatively resistant to first-line agents. Hematological manifestations of COVID-19, such as the ones associated with life-threatening bleeding, must be recognized.",

He was mechanically ventilated with lung protective ventilation and prone positioning and was sedated with propofol, fentanyl and cisatracurium infusions. He received ceftriaxone, azithromycin and a thromboprophylaxis with unfractionated heparin. His disease was complicated by acute kidney injury (creatinine rising up to 689 \u03bcmol/L) that required renal replacement therapy and by a methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus ventilator-associated pneumonia treated with a 2-day course of empirical piperacillin-tazobactam and 6 days of cefazolin. On the 20th day, the patient was spontaneously breathing on pressure support ventilation with an inspired concentration of oxygen of 35%. Since he developed ICU-acquired neuromyopathy, a tracheotomy was performed to facilitate weaning of mechanical ventilation. During the procedure, abnormal bleeding from the tracheotomy site and the left main stem bronchus was noticed. We observed afterwards that the platelet count had dramatically fallen from 311 \u00d7 10 9 /L the day before to 23 \u00d7 10 9 /L with stable other blood cell counts ( Table 1 ). The patient did not have any skin purpura.

We also administered several platelet and red blood cell transfusions as well as intravenous tranexamic acid. Due to bleeding and clotting causing complete atelectasis of his left lung and thus severe hypoxemia, he required several daily endobronchial clot removal procedures. The bleeding finally stopped with the aforementioned high platelet transfusion support, although we did not observe any improvement in the platelet count at ITP day 5. In spite of 4 days of optimal first-line therapy, the patient still presented profound thrombocytopenia requiring continuous platelet transfusion support (Table 1) . We then decided to proceed with second-line agents and administered romiplostim daily from ITP day 5-14 and a dose of vincristine on ITP day 9. We also administered pulse doses of 500 milligrams of intravenous methylprednisolone daily from ITP days 10-13 (Table 1) . We did not consider splenectomy as an appropriate treatment at this stage of the disease.

The observed thrombocytopenia was relatively resistant to first-line therapies and additional therapies such as romiplostim, an erythropoietin (TPO) receptor agonist, and low-dose vincristine were administered. Thrombocytopenia finally started to improve after 10 days of treatments. Although the patient presented life-threatening bleeding, he improved and survived this episode.",

            "text": "The patient had received several days of penicillin-based treatment and cephalosporins. However, we do not believe that his thrombocytopenia was an adverse effect of the antibiotic treatments due to the rapidity and the severity of the platelet fall. Rare cases of antibiotic associated ITP have been described, but the thrombocytopenia seemed to recover quickly after the agent had been stopped [7] . Besides, cefazolin was not specifically one of them. Different hematologic abnormalities have been observed in COVID-19 patients. Most of them have resulted in a hypercoagulable state causing thrombotic complications [8] . Nevertheless, mild thrombocytopenia has been observed in up to one third of patients with COVID-19 [1] . A recent study described characteristics of patients presenting with delayed (14 days after symptom onset) SARS-CoV-2 associated thrombocytopenia [9] . Although observed thrombocytopenias were associated with a longer hospital stay and a higher mortality, they were mild and transient (lasting less than 7 days) and not associated with bleeding [9] . These thrombocytopenias were likely multifactorial and etiologies 30 -such as decreased bone marrow production and immune destruction were proposed. Most of them were probably not ITP. Such mild thrombocytopenia has also been described in ARDS of pulmonary and extra-pulmonary etiologies and has also been associated with higher mortality [10] . Very few reported cases of hematological manifestations of COVID-19, such as our case, led to severe bleeding complications. Although four cases of COVID-19 ITP have already been reported, most of them occurred early after COVID-19 disease onset and responded well to first-line agents [5, 6] . One of the recently published cases presented a similar thrombocytopenia timeline to our case [6] . This patient presented a severe thrombocytopenia at day 12 of hospitalization while under anticoagulants for a pulmonary embolism for 48 h. He presented an important hemorrhagic episode, only received platelet transfusions to treat thrombocytopenia and died within 24 h, precluding any further observation [6] . Although our case shares with this case the late presentation characteristic, ours is the only one that presented itself with life-threatening bleeding and intracerebral hemorrhage solely due to such a late occurring severe thrombocytopenia. Furthermore, it is the first case of COVID-19 associated ITP showing relative resistance to first-line ITP agents, as all other reported cases presented platelet count improvement within few days after IVIG administration [5, 6] . Although we administered therapies that have been previously used to increase platelet production in refractory cases that are at high risk of bleeding, we believed we observed a late response to first-line agents, since second-line agents did not have time to show any significant clinical effect [4, 11] .",

Amongst reported COVID-19 associated ITP cases, including ours, bleeding is frequently reported [5, 6] . This observation may be either related to specific pathophysiological characteristics of the disease or to a reporting bias but needs further attention. We also observed a relative time lag in the clinical response to ITP first-line agents in our case. This relative lag may be caused by the underlying disease severity and its associated high antibody load but may also be related to the ongoing bleeding that may have contributed to platelet consumption and loss of the administered IVIG. Although it is not unusual for ITP to start to improve after 7-10 days of treatment, such a late response is not common [4] .",
