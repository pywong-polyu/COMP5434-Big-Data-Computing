UC-MSCs may have beneficial effects in patients with severe COVID-19 by modulating immune responses and altering the immunopathogenic cytokine storm. 30-32 The cells used in this trial were derived from the subepithelial lining of the umbilical cord and can be rapidly expanded for clinical applications under strict Good Manufacturing Practice conditions. 37 UC-MSCs were reported to be safe in clinical trials in other disease states and have been safely administered across histocompatibility barriers. 44-46 Because of their immunomodulatory functions, UC-MSCs have already been tested in the treatment of autoimmune and inflammatory disorders. Clinical applications using UC-MSCs processed at our cGMP facility have been authorized by the FDA in subjects with T1D (IND#018302) and Alzheimer's disease (IND#18200). Several clinical trials have been conducted to test MSCs as treatment of ARDS, mainly focused on determining safety. 25-29 Variable results have been reported, possibly because of differences in trial design and quality of the cell product used. Improved outcomes were recently reported in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia treated with angiotensin converting enzyme -2 (ACE-2)-negative MSCs. 30 Additional pilot studies of UC-MSCs for COVID-19 also reported promising results. 31-33 Based on previous encouraging results by other groups, 30-33 our experience with cell therapy clinical protocols, and the urgent need to develop effective therapeutic strategies, the purpose of this RCT was to determine safety and explore efficacy of UC-MSCs for treatment of subjects with ARDS secondary to COVID-19 (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT04355728). The current report presents, for the first time, the results of a double-blind, phase 1/2a RCT testing UC-MSCs in 24 subjects with COVID-19 and ARDS. There was overall balance in the distribution of baseline characteristics, comorbidities, or concomitant treatments between the groups. No serious adverse events related to UC-MSC infusion were observed. There was no observed difference in number of subjects experiencing infusion-associated adverse events. At 28 days after the last infusion, patient survival was 91% in the UC-MSC group and 42% in the control group (P = .015).

The only differences observed at baseline, in body mass index and obesity, would be expected to worsen COVID-19 outcomes in the UC-MSC treatment group.47,48 The viral load at baseline did not differ significantly between the UC-MSC treatment and the control group. An important change in inclusion criteria is worthy of discussion. The study was initially designed to enroll patients receiving invasive mechanical ventilation. At the time of study inception, there were concerns regarding the potential for high flow oxygen therapy and noninvasive mechanical ventilation to increase aerosolization and infection risk in health care workers. Such concerns led practitioners to avoid these therapies and prompted infection control leadership to restrict them in our study sites. Subsequent studies called these concerns into question,49 and high flow oxygen became broadly used. At that time, it appeared appropriate to include in our trial patients of similar disease severity but who were being treated with a different modality, and on 22 June 2020, we made a change in our inclusion criteria to reflect this. Subsequent studies have shown that high flow oxygen therapy is associated with a reduction in the proportion of patients who receive invasive mechanical ventilation, but no difference in mortality.12 This supports the idea that the change of inclusion criteria did not necessarily alter the severity of patients enrolled but rather just reflects the secular trends and treatment patterns in the care of patients with a novel disease.The inferences we make from the efficacy results observed in this phase 1/2a trial in 24 subjects, including the outcome of survival, are still subject to limitations of sample size and potential bias because of factors we were not yet aware of. However, results do provide preliminary evidence of a remarkable effect, which substantiates the need for further investigation in a larger, stratified, and adjusted clinical trial. In addition, based on our results and those from previously reported clinical trials, synergistic combination strategies could be explored, with agents that have shown a beneficial effect at similar stages of COVID-19 disease progression, such as dexamethasone11",
