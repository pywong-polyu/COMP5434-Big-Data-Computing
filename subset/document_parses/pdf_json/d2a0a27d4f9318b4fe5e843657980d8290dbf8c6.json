It immediately implemented the following strategic human resource management measures (SHRMMs) for COVID-19 epidemic (Table): 1. Middle managers (non-clinical and clinical supervisors) must attend daily epidemic prevention contingency meetings, so they can remain up to date with the latest international and domestic epidemic and prevention approaches. A total of 179 meetings were held with 12 399 recorded attendances, and an average of 69.27 attendances per manager. 2. Clinical directors are encouraged to serve as on-site epidemic prevention commanders at the main entrances and exits for 2-hour shifts. This is to enable clinical directors to understand the implementation of EPMs and to advise and assist frontline staff who face an influx of patients, especially suspected COVID-19 cases. Clinical directors have served as on-site epidemic prevention commanders, with an average of 2.45 rotations per person. 3. Administrative service managers are required to walk around the hospital during their workday so that they have a firstperson perspective on hospital practice. Under the current rotation system for middle managers, supervision and implementation of epidemic prevention work at the entrance will be expanded. Administrative service managers will serve as first-line commanders, assisting the hospital COVID-19 response team to monitor the implementation of various EPMs, resolve disputes, and provide on-site feedback for adopting rolling EPMs. A total of 825 middle managers took part in on-site command work, with an average of 13.75 rotations per person.",
