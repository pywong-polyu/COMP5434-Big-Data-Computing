            "text": "Aim: As the COVID-19 pandemic evolves, human milk banks world-wide continue to provide donor human milk to vulnerable infants who lack access to mother's own milk. Under these circumstances, ensuring the safety of donor human milk is paramount, as the risk of vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is not fully understood. Here, we investigate the inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 in human milk by pasteurisation and the stability of SARS-CoV-2 in human milk under cold storage. Methods: SARS-CoV-2 was experimentally inoculated into human milk samples from healthy donors or into a control medium. Triplicates of each sample were layered onto uninfected cells after Holder pasteurisation (63 C for 30 min), heating to 56 C for 30 min, or after 48 h of storage at 4 C or \u221230 C. Infectious titres of virus were determined at 72 h post-infection by endpoint titration. Results: Following heating to 63 C or 56 C for 30 min, replication competent (i.e. live) SARS-CoV-2 was undetected in both human milk and the control medium. Cold storage of SARS-CoV-2 in human milk (either at 4 C or \u221230 C) did not significantly impact infectious viral load over a 48 h period. Conclusion: SARS-CoV-2 is effectively inactivated by Holder pasteurisation, suggesting that existing milk bank processes will effectively mitigate the risk of transmission of SARS-COV-2 to vulnerable infants through pasteurised donor human milk. The demonstrated stability of SARS-CoV-2 in refrigerated or frozen human milk may assist in the development of guidelines around safe expressing and storing of milk from COVID-19 infected mothers.",

Expressed milk may theoretically become contaminated from maternal respiratory secretions or via skin, although there is no evidence to suggest that breast milk is a means of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 to infants. Respiratory transmission from mother to infant remains the more likely transmission route. Consistent with available data, international guidelines recommend mothers with COVID-19 continue to provide breast milk for their babies as the benefits of breast milk outweigh risks of virus transmission. 2 Although low, the potential risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission through human milk is concerning for milk banks globally. 1 Here, we investigate the inactivation by pasteurisation of SARS-CoV-2 experimentally inoculated in to human milk and the stability of SARS-CoV-2 in human milk under cold storage (freezing or refrigeration).",

The TCID 50 is a standard measure of infectious virus titre. Triplicates of each sample were layered onto uninfected cells after being subjected to Holder pasteurisation (63 C for 30 min), under-pasteurisation (56 C for 30 min) or were unpasteurised. Endpoint titration of samples was performed on Vero cells in sextuplicate, and theTCID 50 determined at 72 h post-infection using standard methods. 6 Freshly expressed milk from two donors and MEM (control) was similarly inoculated with SARS-CoV-2 to assess virus stability under cold storage conditions. Infectious titres of samples were measured at the time of inoculation, and after 48 h of storage at 4 C or \u221230 C.

Holder pasteurisation (62.5 C for 30 min) is the most common pasteurisation method among milk banks world-wide, and has been shown to inactivate most enveloped viruses, including MERS-CoV 9 and SARS-CoV-1. 10 Our findings confirm that SARS-CoV-2 in human milk can be effectively inactivated by Holder pasteurisation, and that existing milk bank processes will effectively mitigate the risk of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 to vulnerable infants through PDHM. These findings are consistent with a recent study that reported SARS-CoV-2 is inactivated by heat treatment, 10 in different matrices. It should be noted that our study involved experimental inoculation of SARS-CoV-2 in to human milk, and thus may not be fully representative of the behaviour of the virus if present in the breast milk of a mother with COVID-19. However, the high infectious titre of virus used for inoculation of samples in the current study is representative of a worst case scenario, if virus was found to be present in human milk.",

Infectious titres were determined in triplicates of each sample that were subjected to Holder (63 C) pasteurisation (ND), under-pasteurisation (56 C) (ND) or were unpasteurised (black). (b) Stability under cold storage conditions. Freshly expressed breast milk (n = 2) or MEM (n = 3) was inoculated with SARS-CoV-2. Infectious titres of samples were determined at 0 h post-inoculation (black), and after 48 h of storage at either +4 C (grey) or \u221230 C (blue). Infectious titres for all experiments were determined using endpoint titration on Vero cells in sextuplicate. Error bars indicate the standard error of the mean.
