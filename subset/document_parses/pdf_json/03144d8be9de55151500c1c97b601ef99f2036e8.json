            "text": "Detection of nocturnal seizures in epilepsy patients is essential, both for the quick management of the seizure complications, and for the assessment of the ongoing seizure treatment. Traditional seizure detection products (e.g., wearables), however, are either very costly, uncomfortable, or unreliable. In this paper, we then propose to utilize everyday WiFi signals for robust, fast, and non-invasive detection of nocturnal seizures. We first present a new and rigorous mathematical characterization for the spectral content/bandwidth of the WiFi signal, measured on a WiFi device placed near a sleeping patient, during different kinds of sleep motions: seizures, normal movements (e.g. posture adjustments), and breathing. Based on this mathematical modeling, we propose a novel pipeline for processing the received WiFi signals to robustly detect all nocturnal non-breathing movements, and then classify them into normal body movements or seizures. In order to validate this, we carry out extensive experiments in 7 different typical bedroom locations, where a set of 20 actors simulate the state of having seizures (total of 260 instances), as well as normal sleep movements (total of 410 instances). Our proposed system detects 93.85% of the seizures with a mean response time of only 5.69 seconds since the onset of the seizure. Moreover, our proposed system achieves a probability of false alarm of only 0.0097, when classifying normal sleep movements. Overall, our new mathematical modeling and experimental results show the great potential the ubiquitous WiFi signals have for detecting nocturnal seizures, which can provide better support for epilepsy patients and their caregivers.",

            "text": "Epilepsy is a neurological disorder that causes a patient to have different kinds of seizures. It has gained a lot of attention in the public health domain since it is one of the most common neurological disorders, causing a large number of people to suffer from persistent health and socioeconomic issues. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that 50 million people around the world suffer from epilepsy, as of 2019 [1] . Epilepsy is treated using different Anti-Epileptic Drugs (AEDs), depending on the specific type of seizure it is causing. Assessment of the ongoing seizure treatment requires the caregivers of the patient to continuously monitor and document the seizures (i.e., their frequency and duration). Seizures which take place during night sleep (medically known as Nocturnal Seizures) then pose a higher risk for epilepsy patients, since they can go unobserved by the caregivers [2] . This necessitates the need for in-home seizure monitoring devices that can detect nocturnal seizures in epilepsy patients and alert their B caregivers. The presence of a caregiver during a seizure is also very important so that they can help the patient, prevent them from falling, administer rescue medications (if necessary), and/or call for medical help if the seizure is lasting for too long. Moreover, patients who continue to have unattended nocturnal seizures have a higher risk of death due to the complications caused by the unattended seizures, a condition that is medically known as Sudden Unexpected Death in Epilepsy (SUDEP) [2] . SUDEP has been found to usually follow a specific type of seizures called tonic-clonic seizures, which happens more frequently than other types during sleep [3] . Tonic-clonic seizures are characterized by a tonic phase, in which the body muscles stiffen for a few seconds, followed by a clonic phase, in which the body muscles rapidly and rhythmically jerk for 1-3 minutes [4] . 1 In order to detect nocturnal seizures, several products have been made available, such as smart watches [5] , smart mattresses [6] , and cameras [7] . Smart watches measure the acceleration of the wrist to detect violent jerky movements, while smart mattresses measure the changes in the pressure on the mattress. However, the large cost of these products prohibits their widespread use. For instance, smart watches (e.g., Apple Watch and Embrace2 [5] ), and the MP5 bed motion monitoring unit [6] all cost more than $250 per unit. Moreover, the comfort of patients and the reliability of detection of some of these products have been questioned by several studies, as we shall discuss in Sec. II.",

Using everyday RF signals, i.e. WiFi signals, for such a task has several advantages. First, it is an affordable solution when compared to the high cost of existing approaches. It is also contactless since it does not require the patient to wear any device or have units installed under their mattress. Moreover, an RFbased system, unlike cameras, does not require any lighting conditions to accurately achieve its task. In this paper, we then propose to use a pair of WiFi transceivers to detect nocturnal seizures. More specifically, we propose a robust, fast, and theoretically-driven approach to process the WiFi Channel State Information (CSI) measured on a WiFi receiver device placed near a sleeping patient, in order to extract their motion information and decide whether the motion indicates a seizure or not. By \"robust\", we mean that our proposed framework has a very low probability of false alarm, i.e., it has a very low probability of declaring a seizure when there is none, while detecting all the seizures with a high probability. This is important as the sleeping person may have several normal body movements, such as pose adjustments, and they should not be classified as a seizure. By \"fast\", we mean that our system detects a seizure in a very short time since its onset, in order to alert the caregiver in a timely manner. Finally, by \"theoretically-driven\", we mean that our proposed approach is backed by a new and rigorous mathematical characterization of the spectral content of the received signal during sleep-related movements: seizure, normal body movements, and breathing.",

We develop a novel and rigorous mathematical model for the received CSI squared magnitude signal as well as the CSI antenna phase difference during different kinds of motions relevant to sleep: seizure, normal body movements, and breathing. More specifically, we first show that both the WiFi CSI squared magnitude and phase difference signals are frequency-modulated by the body motion. We then show our main theoretical contribution: to mathematically characterize the spectral content/bandwidth of the WiFi CSI signal during the aforementioned motions. Based on this new spectral analysis, we then show that the bandwidth of the received WiFi signal can be used to robustly and efficiently differentiate seizure events from normal sleep movements. 2. Based on our theoretical analysis, we propose a new pipeline for the detection of nocturnal seizures using WiFi CSI, which consists of the following 3 steps. First, our data pre-processing pipeline denoises the raw measured CSI and selects the least noisy data streams of different receiver antennas/subcarriers using our spectral analysis findings. Then, our event detection algorithm detects any kind of non-breathing motion, based on the spectral content of the denoised CSI. Finally, an event classification algorithm decides whether a detected event is a seizure or normal body movement, based on the bandwidth of the WiFi signal during the event. 3 . In order to validate our proposed framework, we carry out extensive experiments on 20 test subjects (5 females and 15 males) in 7 different locations of typical bedrooms, where the subjects act out seizures and normal sleep movements while we collect WiFi CSI data. In total, we collect 260 different seizure instances and 410 different normal non-breathing sleep movement instances. Our system was able to detect 93.85% of the seizures with an average response time of 5.69 seconds since the onset of the seizure, which is much less than the state of the art, as we shall see in Sec. VII. Moreover, in terms of false alarm rate (the probability that a normal sleep event is classified as seizure), our system had a false alarm probability of 0.0097, which indicates its robust performance. We further study the impact of varying several different parameters (e.g., TX/RX positions) on the performance of our proposed system. Overall, our results establish that our proposed mathematically-motivated system is fast and robust and is also independent of person's pose/orientation.",

Other researchers utilized the CSI phase difference between receiver antennas to achieve the same task [17] , [18] . None of such RF-based existing work, however, is on seizure detection. Nevertheless, our findings can have a significant impact on such work for the following reason. All the existing WiFi CSI-based breathing rate estimation work assume that the bandwidth of the received CSI signal, in the vicinity of a person who is breathing normally, is the same as the breathing rate. In order for us to develop a robust nocturnal seizure detection system, we also need to fundamentally understand and characterize the spectral content of normal breathing in this paper. As we shall see, using our proposed rigorous mathematical analysis, the bandwidth of the WiFi signal caused by normal breathing is not necessarily the same as the breathing rate and can be higher. As such, this paper can contribute to the ongoing research that is using breathing signals for other health monitoring applications. In fact, our mathematical analysis can immediately explain the observation made in [16] that the quality of the breathing rate estimation, which was designed assuming the signal bandwidth is the same as the breathing rate, degrades at some locations relative to others. Similarly, it can explain the unexplained frequency peaks that were observed in [19] and were attributed to noise.",

Most seizure detection algorithms in the literature rely on the detection of the motion of the clonic phase of the tonicclonic seizure via accelerometry [20] , [21] , [22] , and/or video analysis [23] , [24] . In accelerometry, a wearable accelerometer is attached to one or more of the patient's body parts, such as wrist, ankle, and/or chest. In addition to their high cost, wearable devices are usually not well tolerated by certain groups of patients, such as children and people with intellectual disabilities, who usually try to dislodge the devices [24] . Furthermore, the authors of [25] concluded that commercial wrist-worn watches have a seizure detection accuracy of 89.7%, which is not very high. Video-based seizure detection has shown good detection accuracy of more than 95%, but with a high false alarm rate of 0.78 events per night [24] , [23] . However, video-based detection requires a clear unobstructed view of the patient with good lighting conditions, which may not always be possible, and further invade the patient's privacy. Overall, an accurate, non-invasive, comfortable, and affordable way of detecting nocturnal seizures is lacking, which is the main motivation for this paper.",

For instance, [26] , [27] study the duration and rate of normal events during sleep, using accelerometry and video analysis, concluding that these events typically happen at a rate of 3 events per hour, last for an average of 8 to 10 seconds, and can go up to 15 seconds.

We first derive closed-form expressions for the WiFi CSI squared magnitude and the WiFi CSI phase difference signals, during a generic motion pattern of the body, in this part. In Sec. IV, we then use this model to provide a new and rigorous mathematical analysis of the spectral content of the WiFi signals during specific kinds of sleep motions relevant to this paper, i.e., breathing, seizures, and normal sleep movements.

Consider the ellipse whose foci are the Tx and Rx, which passes through the person's body, \u03c6 is then the angle between the line connecting the person to the Tx (or Rx) and the perpendicular line to this ellipse at the point that it passes through the person's body (see Fig. 1 ). v(t) is the instantaneous speed component of the body motion along the perpendicular line to the ellipse, and \u03bb is the wavelength. Note that the value of \u03c8 depends on the scene configuration, i.e., the relative location of the bed with respect to the Tx and Rx, and does not depend on the person's posture and orientation while sleeping. In other words, if the width of the bed is small as compared to the Tx-Rx distance, or the person does not drastically move from one side of the bed to the other (which is common in practice), the sleeping person's general location with respect to the Tx and the Rx does not drastically change, and hence, \u03c8 can be taken as a constant and can be calculated only once upon Tx-Rx placement.

By applying this to Eq. 7, we can then estimate the bandwidth as follows: BW = (\u03b2 \u2032 +1)f o for \u03b2 \u2032 \u2265 1 since some even and odd terms are both present for \u03b2 \u2032 \u2265 1 and terms can be compared accordingly within each even and odd groups. When \u03b2 \u2032 < 1, however, the previous result implies that the term n = 1 is the only dominating term in the spectrum of y(t). However, due to the different scaling factors of the even and odd terms in Eq. 7, there could exist cases (e.g., small \u2206\u00b5) where the term corresponding to n = 1 is suppressed by the sin(\u2206\u00b5) factor. In such cases, even though J 2 (\u03b2 \u2032 ) is small as compared to J 1 (\u03b2 \u2032 ), cos(\u2206\u00b5)J 2 (\u03b2 \u2032 ) can be comparable or larger than sin(\u2206\u00b5)J 1 (\u03b2 \u2032 ). Higher order terms can always be neglected with respect to the first two terms. Hence, the bandwidth of y(t) for the case of \u03b2 \u2032 < 1 is 2f o .",

As mentioned earlier, our received signal y(t) has a close resemblance to an FM signal, except for the \u2206\u00b5 terms. As such, our bandwidth analysis has some resemblance to Carson's derivations except for the impact of \u2206\u00b5.

Hence, they assume that the received signal has the same spectral content/bandwidth as that of the physical chest motion (i.e. they take BW br to be f o,br ). However, Theorem 2 shows that the received WiFi signals can have a spectral content that is different from the physical breathing rate, depending on the value of \u2206\u00b5, with a maximum bandwidth of 2f o,br . To see this in effect, Fig. 2 shows the phase difference of the measured WiFi signals between the Rx antennas in a sample experiment, where a person was breathing with a frequency of f o,br \u2248 0.18 Hz. It can be seen that while the measured phase difference between antennas 3 and 1 of the Rx has a sinusoid-like pattern similar to that of the breathing motion, the phase difference between antennas 2 and 1 (due to having a different \u2206\u00b5) is experiencing a different pattern, which has a strong frequency component at 2f o,br .",

Several medical studies have been conducted to analyze body motion during a tonic-clonic seizure through data obtained by accelerometry. These studies have found that during the clonic phase of a tonic-clonic seizure, the body muscles rhythmically stiffen and 3 In our experiments, we use WiFi channel 48 (fc = 5.24 GHz) in a setup in which \u03c8 \u2248 1 (see Sec. VI for the detailed scene configuration). Extension to different values of \u03c8 is straightforward, as we shall discuss in Sec. VII-B where we show experiments with different \u03c8s. Hence, we set \u03bb = 5.72 cm and \u03c8 = 1 for our numerical calculations in the rest of the paper up to Sec. VII-B. relax with a frequency f o,sz between 1.5 and 5 Hz [36] , [37] , [20] , thus making a sinusoid a good approximation for v(t). Therefore, Eq. 7 also characterizes the frequency spectrum of the WiFi CSI during a seizure. In order to find the value of the parameter v max , and thus \u03b2 \u2032 , we have looked extensively into the medical literature on seizures. Several papers have found that the maximum acceleration, a max , of the body parts during a tonic-clonic seizure typically exceeds 15 m/s 2 [21] , [22] . Since v(t) is sinusoidal, then v max,sz = amax 2\u03c0fsz , and a lower bound for the value of v max,sz can be calculated as v max,sz \u2265 15 2\u03c0\u00d75 = 0.48 m/s. Based on the aforementioned seizure motion parameters, one can estimate a lower bound for the bandwidth of the WiFi CSI during a seizure using Theorem 2 as BW sz = (\u03b2 \u2032 sz + 1)f sz = \u03c8vmax,sz \u03bb + f o,sz . More specifically, by using WiFi channel 48 and \u03c8 = 1, v max,sz = 0.48 m/s and f o,sz = 1.5 Hz, a lower bound for the bandwidth of the WiFi signal during the seizure is estimated as BW sz \u2265 9.9 Hz. Note that the aforementioned characterization of the CSI bandwidth during a seizure assumes that the motion of at least one body part is aligned with (or has a strong component on) the perpendicular line to the Tx-Rx ellipse of Fig. 1 . This assumption is practical since the uncontrolled muscle jerks during the seizure result in the body parts moving randomly in all different directions. Moreover, it has been shown in the medical literature that a patient's body posture can change to many different positions during a seizure [38] . Therefore, there will at least be one body part whose motion direction is aligned with the perpendicular line to the Tx/Rx ellipse.",

Fig. 3 shows the block diagram of our proposed system, which starts by preprocessing the WiFi CSI input data to denoise the measured CSI signal and extract the part that carries the information about the human motion. Then, the denoised signal is passed to an event detection module, which decides whether the person is moving or is staying still. In case a movement event is detected (other than breathing), the CSI data during the event is then forwarded to an event classification module, which determines whether this event is a normal sleep event or a seizure. In the latter case, the system alarms the caregiver to take the necessary action. We next describe each of these components in details.",

In this paper, we consider off-the-shelf WiFi devices that can be used to extract the complex WiFi CSI information, e.g. Intel 5300 or Atheros AR9580 WiFi cards. In any of these devices, the receiver has N R receiver antennas, which measure the WiFi CSI information on N sc subcarriers. Therefore, we extract a total of N R \u00d7N sc CSI squared magnitude streams, and (N R \u22121)\u00d7N sc phase difference streams (i.e. the phase difference between each antenna and antenna 1, for all the N sc subcarriers). In total, we get N D = (2N R \u2212 1) \u00d7 N sc data streams that can be used to extract the motion information. The Intel 5300 WiFi card, for instance, has N R = 3 receiver antennas and N sc = 30 subcarriers, resulting in a total of N D = 150 data streams carrying the motion information of the body. We next show how we process these N D data streams to extract the informative part about the body motion.",

However, relying solely on event duration for deciding whether the event is a seizure or not induces an unfavorable delay in the system response, as the system would have to wait for a relatively long period of time before declaring an event as a seizure, which can lead to undesirable complications for the patient. It is then crucial to analyze the detected events in terms of their frequency content, using the analysis and parameters derived in Sec. IV, in order to have an early and robust detection. We next describe our event classification algorithm. First, any event whose duration is less than a tolerable value T min is declared as a normal event. This step is important to avoid the unnecessary computational overhead of analyzing very short events, such as sleep jerks or very quick limb movements, since it is almost impossible for a tonic-clonic seizure to have such a short duration [37] . It is noteworthy that this comes at the expense of a small delay in the response time, since a seizure would only be declared at least T min after its onset. As a design choice, we set T min = 5 sec for our system implementation. We will show the effect of varying T min on the system performance in Sec. VII.",

The other laptop (the Rx) uses CSItool [41] to measure the CSI data of 30 WiFi subcarriers on 3 Rx antennas. The CSI magnitude data and the phase difference data with respect to antenna 1 (i.e. \u03b8 2 (t) \u2212 \u03b8 1 (t) and \u03b8 3 (t) \u2212 \u03b8 1 (t)) are then logged and processed offline using MATLAB.

In all the locations, we start by placing the Tx and Rx on two different sides of the bed on which the test subject lies down (with Tx-Rx distance of \u223c 2.5 m). The antennas of the Tx and Rx are both elevated by 70 cm above the bed level. We then study the impact of different Tx/Rx configurations in Sec. VII.

In total, the number of subjects participating in each of the 7 locations are 11, 6, 4, 2, 1, 1, and 1 subjects, respectively. 6 Each participant was consensually trained on how to simulate a tonic-clonic seizure and shown public online YouTube videos explaining how tonic-clonic seizures look like. It is worth noting that seizure acting is a common practice in medical schools, where healthy persons (known as standardized patients) are recruited to act out different medical conditions to provide introductory training opportunities for medical students [42] , [43] . Hence, testing a system on simulated seizures is an important step towards more advanced clinical trials. For each subject, the receiver starts logging the CSI data when the subject is in a sleep state (only breathing and in any generic position) for at least 15 seconds (part of which to be used as one-time calibration data). Then the subject starts simulating seizures and normal sleep movements. Each seizure instance is simulated for at least 20 seconds. 7 In total, each participant does 10 seizure simulations per location, resulting in a total of 260 independent instances of seizure data across all the locations. Similarly, each subject performs several normal non-breathing sleep movements spontaneously in each experiment. By observing the subjects' movements, they included posture adjustments (e.g. switching from lying on their side to lying on their back), limb-only movements (e.g. stretching or tucking the knee), scratching, stretching, coughing, sneezing, and sleep jerks. Overall, we collected a total of 410 independent normal sleep events from all subjects in all the locations. 8 Performance Metrics: We test the performance of our system according to the following two performance metrics: Algorithm Parameter Values: We set the following values for different algorithm parameters, T cal = 13 sec, T ED win = 2 sec, T EC win = 4 sec, T min = 5 sec, K = 15, and q = 2. The optimum classification threshold, f th , is then found based on our proposed mathematical framework to be f th = 8.85 Hz, as shown in Sec. IV. It is worth stressing that this threshold is found based on our rigorous theoretical characterization of the bandwidth, and not based on empirical data. The effect of varying some of these parameters on system performance is shown in Sec. VII. 7 An actual tonic-clonic seizure can last for 1 to 3 minutes. However, it is a physically-challenging task for a healthy person to simulate it for such a long time. 8 Sample data files and detection/classification codes are available in this URL https://doi.org/10.21229/M9ZT09 ",

Overall, our results show the robustness of our proposed system, in terms of achieving a very good seizure detection rate, probability of false alarm, and a fast average response time of 5.69 seconds to detect a seizure, while being non-invasive, and privacy preserving. We note that part of the contribution of this paper was also to develop a new mathematical model that can enable seizure detection using WiFi signals, while most of the existing work is mainly either testing an existing product, or utilizing straightforward modalities, e.g. accelerometry. Furthermore, our approach is the only privacy-preserving one that is also non-invasive. While our results are based on simulated seizures, they constitute a strong proof-of-concept for our proposed idea/mathematical models, which shows how RF signals (e.g. WiFi) can be used as a non-invasive, robust, and affordable alternative for nocturnal seizure detection. Hence, our proposed algorithms serve as a basis for a system that can be subsequently tested in clinical settings, towards the ultimate goal of making such technology available to the public.",

It can be seen that SDR decreases (becomes worse) when increasing f th , since more seizure events can go undetected due to their bandwidth being less than the higher f th . On the other hand, increasing f th improves P FA , since it becomes less likely for the bandwidth of the WiFi signal during a normal sleep event to exceed a higher f th .

On the other hand, increasing T min improves P FA , since a higher portion of the normal events are declared normal by default due to their short duration. It can be seen that the chosen value of T min = 5 sec strikes a good balance in the MRT-P FA tradeoff. It is worth noting that SDR does not change as a function of T min in Fig. 7 , and as such is not plotted.

Such a configuration can be of particular interest in practical situations in which one side of the bed is not accessible, e.g. if the bed is placed next to a wall. The distance between the Tx and the Rx is 2 m, and both are elevated by 70 cm above the bed level. This setup results in \u03c8 \u2248 1.4, which will result in BW sz \u2265 13.23 Hz, and BW nm \u2264 10.06 Hz using our mathematical derivations. We thus use f th = 13.23+10.06 2 = 11.64 Hz for this configuration. On the other hand, in C#3, the Tx and Rx are placed on two different sides of the bed, with a Tx-Rx distance of 3.6 m, while they are elevated by 70 cm above the bed level.

We summarize the evaluation results of these experiments in Table III .

In such a case, the event detection module detects any movement done by any of the sleeping persons. In order to test this, we conducted a 10-minute experiment where two people lie down next to each other on a bed. Person 1 simulates seizures at the 6 and 9-minute marks. Otherwise, both people frequently simulate normal sleep movements. As such, there are a number of instances where both people move at the same time, or one person moves normally while the other one is simulating a seizure. Fig. 8 (top) shows the PCAdenoised stream p(t), in which perturbations are clearly visible whenever either persons engages in any kind of movement, while Fig. 8 (bottom) shows the bandwidth of the WiFi signals during the detected events. It can be seen that the bandwidth exceeds f th for an extended period of time only during the seizure instances, which are correctly classified as seizures, even though the second person was moving during the second seizure instance.

VII-C, we have shown that our proposed system is robust to movements by other sleeping people in the same environment, since their normal sleeping movements have the same characteristics as those of the patient. Next, consider the case where other simultaneous movements happen, such as those of a walking person. The spectrogram of the signal reflected off of a walking person has specific characteristics. Thus, as part of future work, one can study the differentiability of the signals induced by walking from those induced by seizures. Furthermore, the reflected signals off of other moving targets can also be filtered out at the Rx by exploiting more signal dimensions. For instance, multiple antennas at the Rx can separate the received signals based on their Angle-of-Arrival (AoA).",

We then utilized this analysis to design a robust seizure detection system, which detects all non-breathing body motion events and classifies them, based on their spectral content, to normal movements and seizures. We experimentally validated our proposed system using WiFi CSI data collected from 20 actors in 7 different locations, where they simulated a total of 260 seizures as well as 410 normal sleep movements. Our proposed system achieved a very low probability of false alarm of 0.0097, while being very responsive to seizure events, detecting 93.85% of the seizure instances with an average response time of only 5.69 seconds.
