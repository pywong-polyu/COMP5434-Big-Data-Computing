The way the virus spreads inside hosts, and how this spread interacts with host immunity and physiology, is likely to determine variation in health outcomes. Decades of data and dynamical analyses of how other viruses spread and interact with host cells could shed light on SARS-CoV-2 within-host trajectories. We review how common axes of variation in within-host dynamics and emergent pathology (such as age and sex) might be combined with ecological principles to understand the case of SARS-CoV-2. We highlight pitfalls in application of existing theoretical frameworks relevant to the complexity of the within-host context and frame the discussion in terms of growing knowledge of the biology of SARS-CoV-2. Viewing health outcomes for SARS-CoV-2 through the lens of ecological models underscores the value of repeated measures on individuals, especially since many lines of evidence suggest important contingence on trajectory.",

Leveraging known aspects of viral biology (e.g., in vitro replication indicates that the eclipse period, or interlude separating cell invasion to virus production, is approximately 6 to 8 hours), trajectories of viral load can be used to estimate R 0 and the serial interval for within-host spread (S1 Text). To date, such approaches place the within-host R 0 of SARS-CoV-2 between 3 and 8 [12, 13] , and potentially as high as 20 in the lower respiratory tract where this has been estimated separately [14] . Assuming a serial interval of less than a day, this indicates very rapid growth of the number of infected cells-more than tripling every day.",

            "text": "The magnitude of R 0 also provides an approximation for the threshold for \"herd immunity,\" or the proportion of the susceptible pool that must be removed for the incidence of infection to start declining (S1 Text). Within-host, target cells can be removed from the susceptible pool by direct viral damage to the epithelial cells of the respiratory tract, or \"friendly fire\" from the immune system, as described for influenza [15] . Striking lung damage observed even in asymptomatic, SARS-CoV-2-positive individuals [16] suggests that loss of target cells could be sufficient to slow (although perhaps not stop) within-host viral spread. Uninfected cells can also be \"removed\" from the susceptible pool by the effects of the type 1 interferon pathway, a fast-acting early signaling cascade associated with innate immunity that causes cells to become refractory to infection [17, 18] . In influenza in ponies, more than half the susceptible cells are estimated to be able to become refractory within 2 to 3 days [11] ; importantly, this immune pathway seems to be often impaired by SARS-CoV-2 [19] . For a within-host R 0 between 3 and 8, between 60% and 80% of the uninfected target cells would have to be resistant or otherwise made refractory for viral loads to start to decline (by analogy with the threshold for herd immunity) because 1 infected cell results in less than 1 new infected cell assuming that target cell availability is the key driver of viral spread. However, models also suggest that SARS-CoV-2 disseminates slowly through different regions of the lungs (driving the long duration of infection in some individuals) [14] , so that relatively spatially restricted depletion of target cells to 60% or 80% could effectively slow or prevent spread.",

Susceptible depletion (declining blue line) eventually means that the proportion infected ceases to grow (herd immunity threshold). Early events (e.g., earlier virus detection via TLR7 in females) will have disproportionate effects on the trajectory of viral growth by compounding impacts on exponential growth. (B) Predator-prey models also broadly reflect consumer resource models, here with parameters illustrating population cycling (rabbit populations collapse as wolf populations (and thus predation) increase; but once rabbit numbers are too low to sustain wolf populations, these in turn collapse, and so on). Within-host, such compensatory dependence could explain similar peak viral loads (prey) across hosts (males and females) with different immune system features (predators), although repeated cycling as depicted here is likely to be rare. (C) In collective action models, simple rules at the individual level result in population level information integration (e.g., fish schooling). This might shape immune cell population coordination (e.g., CD4 T-cell fate selection), and disruption of this signaling could contribute to immunopathology; and (D) Alternative Stable States emerge if gradual changes push the state of the community (or immune system) to contexts that complicate return to initial conditions. Here, pro-inflammatory cytokines show accelerating and then staturating growth beyond a threshold of viremia (purple line abruptly increases then flattens) while anti-inflammatory cytokines grow consistently (black line curves smoothly upwards). The growth and decline in the inflammation are equal at the 3 points where the lines intersect. At 2 of these (circles), inflammation grows if it falls, and shrinks if it increases, indicating stable equilibria that may be hard to escape; the square represents an unstable tipping point. Small differences in the timing and magnitude of viremia/the inflammatory response might push some individuals above this tipping point while others remain below, driving very divergent health outcomes in otherwise similar individuals.",

The top panel broadly maps a set of potential immune responses, roughly corresponding to recently described immunotypes [5] : Detecting and responding early (e.g., via early activation of type I Interferons) leading to early resolution, a delayed but ultimately successful response (e.g., via moderate Type 1 T cell activation), or an aberrant response resulting in hyperactivation (e.g., cytokine storms and exhaustion of lymphocytes) and the most severe forms of disease. Hosts of different sexes or ages might differ in propensity to follow the possible trajectories suggested in the top panel. For example, strong early detection and response in females or younger individuals (purple arrow labeled 1) could result in lower early viral loads. Despite delayed control, males or older individuals might still be able to regain the lost ground by successful development of cellular immunity (purple arrow labeled 2); if this response is greater for greater viral loads, this could ultimately result in similar scales of viral load in both slow and fast responding individuals around the peak of viral load. Finally, exhaustion/hyperactivation (of adaptive and innate arms of the immune system, respectively), potentially shaped by events early during infection (\"path dependence,\" such as failure of early interferon defenses or by comorbidities), could result in slower clearance in males or older individuals (purple arrow labeled 3 would correspond to females/younger individuals).",

The metaphor of (specialist) predator-prey dynamics (Fig 1B) is inaccurate at a basic level: The survival of the predators is not directly contingent on consuming the prey, and \"affinity maturation\" in B cells allows predators to become more efficient at capturing prey over short time-scales. Yet, such coupling of \"predator\" (immunity) abundance to \"prey\" (virus) abundance could benefit the host: If immune cells are recruited and expanded only in the presence of the pathogen, fewer resources might be wasted, and the design required is relatively trivial.

Compensatory growth in immune effectors might drive this convergence to the same peak, by analogy with the \"paradox of enrichment\" principle from ecology. For example, a reported correlation between natural killer cells and viral load in SARS-CoV-2 [33] could lead to individuals with early high viral loads (e.g., males) having concomitant growth in immune effectors like natural killer cells that reduce viral load-and this could bring viral load in males in parity with females by the time of the peak.

Increasing evidence of unexpected disjunctions in the sets of immune cell communities detected in patients with the most severe cases suggest that one of the reasons that SARS-CoV-2 pathology emerges is because this virus is somehow disrupting mechanisms underpinning coordinated behavior [38] , with bad outcomes associated with, for example, T-cell-independent B cell responses. Signatures of such disruption might be evoked by reversal of expected sex differences, with, for example, greater antibody responses in males for SARS-CoV-2 [42] , which is at odds with data from a wide range of pathogens and vaccinations [24] .

Although elevated levels of the cytokine interleukin 6 (IL-6) are often identified as a key correlate, SARS-CoV-2 levels of IL-6 generally fall far short of those noted in influenza cytokine storms [43] . This may be because IL-6 is a correlate rather than a driver of the associated inflammation, but it might also reflect the more nuanced issue that a \"cytokine storm\" is likely to denote a path-dependent outcome, i.e., one that depends not just on the state of a system, but also the history of how the system got to that state, and thus is hard to measure using a single quantity like IL-6 at a single time point.",

The schematic in Fig 1D suggests that this could arise if early in the infection, interferon is helping the immune system reach a first protective equilibrium, where inflammation drives down viral incidence without causing too much damage, and low viral load then mutes subsequent immunological activity; whereas later, interferons are forcing the system to stay at the second problematic equilibrium associated with significant levels of immunopathology. This might also help explain the fact that B and T-cell populations remain elevated an entire week in severe cases of SARS-CoV-2 [38] , by contrast with the few days that tend to follow other viral infections or vaccination; the immune system has been caught in a problematic and self-reinforcing stable state and remains there.",

Such small differences either in viral load or in the individual inflammatory context (x and y axes, Fig 1D) might drive the extraordinary variety in health outcomes observed in SARS-CoV-2. As individuals age, levels of inflammation also tend to increase [51] shifting individuals up the y axis on the inset on Fig 1D; and worse outcomes for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) might therefore be more frequent. Higher innate immune cytokines led to worse outcomes relative to healthy volunteers in females over males [6] , in line with more active female immune systems. Conversely, overall, viral loads seem pretty similar between the two sexes [31] and between symptomatic and asymptomatic infections [52] , although symptomatic males might have slightly higher loads than asymptomatic males [53] , aligning with the possibility that male symptoms are associated with a failure to control the infection, that might tip them over into a stable state associated with worse health outcomes. Duration of viral shedding might also be longer in males [37, 54] and associated with worse health outcomes [35] , potentially also by allowing the transition to an alternative stable state.",

Further, a key feature of alternative stable states may be path dependence-i.e., the history of states matters as much as the current state-underscoring the value of longitudinal data, or repeated measures on an individual, in teasing apart drivers of pathology. Considering potential ecological drivers also illustrates ways in which drivers of variation might be elusive. If much of the surprising deregulation and lack of coordination across adaptive immunity recorded [38] is rooted in disruptions to features driving collective behavior, measurement is likely to be very challenging. Collective behavior will rely on transient interactions and plasticity at the individual cell level that may prove very hard to measure.",

Placing these refinements within the broader population context, models could also be adapted to calibrate the role of protection associated with previous exposure to coronaviruses, via cross-reactive antibodies or T cells [55], of relevance for vaccination and its consequence. Our focus here has been on ecological modeling, but an evolutionary ecology perspective will grow in importance as deployment of vaccines generates important selection pressures on the pathogen. The apparently weak association between symptoms and transmission for SARS-CoV-2 suggests that virulence evolution in the wake of selection via vaccination [56] is relatively unlikely, but data-informed models may help bound the range of possible outcomes.",

An analysis focused on the tractable feedbacks (e.g., target cell depletion and viral load-dependent recruitment of natural killer cells) may obscure the role of the harder to measure and perhaps undefined feedbacks. Importantly, these dynamical processes might all effectively cancel out, such that the most practical approach to probing the immune context to better understand pathology in SARS-CoV-2 and project treatment strategies is simply to identify early cytokine profiles that have been largely shown to dictate disease progression [5] and use these to guide delivery of, e.g., interferons or catch later progression into immunopathology to deliver immunosuppressants [57].",
