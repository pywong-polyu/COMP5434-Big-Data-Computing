            "text": "The novel coronavirus pandemic has spread over in 213 countries as of July 2020. Approximately 12 million people have been infected so far according to the reports from World Health Organization (WHO). Preventive measures are being taken globally to avoid the rapid spread of virus. In the current study, an in silico approach is carried out as a means of inhibiting the spike protein of the novel coronavirus by flavonoids from natural sources that possess both antiviral and anti-inflammatory properties. The methodology is focused on molecular docking of 10 flavonoid compounds that are docked with the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, to determine the highest binding affinity at the binding site. Molecular dynamics simulation was carried out with the flavonoid-protein complex showing the highest binding affinity and highest interactions. The flavonoid naringin showed the least binding energy of \u00c09.8 Kcal/mol with the spike protein which was compared with the standard drug, dexamethasone which is being repurposed to treat critically ill patients. MD simulation was carried out on naringin-spike protein complex for their conformational stability in the active site of the novel coronavirus spike protein. The RMSD of the complex appeared to be more stable when compared to that of the protein from 0.2 nm to 0.4 nm. With the aid of this in silico approach further in vitro studies can be carried out on these flavonoids against the novel coronavirus as a means of viral protein inhibitors. \u00d3 2020 The Author(s).

The deadly scenario of COVID-19, started in the month of December 2019, was unraveling in Wuhan city of China and spread across the globe like a wildfire. In the month of January, WHO declared the outbreak as global emergency (Cascella et al., 2020) . According to the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV), Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the present reference name for the virus (Y. Wu et al., 2020b) . Compared to the 2002 SARS epidemic, COVID-19 is apparently less lethal but far more contagious as it spreads with ease among individuals. This novel coronavirus is believed to have instigated as a zoonotic virus that has mutated or adapted to human pathogenicity . The coronaviruses are enveloped single-stranded RNA viruses that can cause several symptoms including fever, troubled respiration, pneumonia and inflammation of the lungs. There are six known coronaviruses, other than SARS-CoV-2, in humans: HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, SARS-CoV, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-HKU1, and MERS-CoV (Adhikari et al., 2020) . It has been officially declared by the WHO as an international public health emergency of concern. Higher transmissibility and pandemic risk levels were found to be higher than SARS-CoV, as the effective reproductive number (R) of ) was estimated at the early stage to be higher than that of . Early patterns of the Covid-19 pathogen have shown similarity to the viral agents of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), the two major coronaviruses that had caused pandemics over the last two decades. Since emerging in China in December 2019, Covid-19 has spread across the globe like a wildfire, claiming approximately 10,25,700 deaths and infecting more than 34 million people (Fig. 1) as of 2nd October 2020 (WHO Weekly operational update and Epidemiological update October 2020 reports).",

However, for some CoVs, full ensemble of structural proteins is not necessarily a requirement to form a complete, infectious virion (Schoeman and Fielding, 2019) . The clinical response spectrum of SARS-CoV-2 is quite broad, ranging from completely asymptomatic to death suggesting variability in either the configuration or the number of ACE-2 targets from person to person. The S1 subunit of the spike protein of coronavirus contains the receptor-binding domain that attaches the virus to the ACE-2 receptor molecule on the host cell membrane. ACE-2, angiotensin converting enzyme-2 is a transmembrane zinc metalloprotein found in the lungs, GI tract, kidneys and blood vessels (Li, 2016) .",

This domain also consists of a membrane-fusion subunit S2 which is activated by the S1-ACE2 binding and helps to fuse the virus to the host cell, resulting in the entry of viral genome. The other two segments are-a short intracellular tail and a single-pass transmembrane anchor. The spike protein has thus been the focus of vaccine and antiviral drug development (Ou et al., 2020) .",

The new guidelines from the Chinese health authorities outlined three main COVID-19 transmission routes: 1) droplet transmission, 2) contact transmission and 3) aerosol transmission. If respiratory droplets are swallowed or inhaled in close proximity by people nearby, droplets transmission occurs; contact transmission arises if a person touches a viruscontaminated surface and then touches the 'T-zone' on their face, primarily the eyes, nose or mouth; and aerosol transmission can happen when respiratory droplets blend in the air, form aerosols and cause infection in a considerably confined area when a large portion of aerosols is inhaled into the lungs. The critically ill patients apart from respiratory failure have other common features which include-elevated inflammatory parameters (CRP, etc.) , diminished lymphocytes in lymphoid organs, unrestrained release of pro-inflammatory cytokines (cytokine storm) and multiple organ failure (R.

Due to the urgent nature of the pandemic, several companies and researchers are working on the development of COVID-19 related therapies. There are drugs that have been repurposed and have gained emergency use authorization (EUA) from the FDA. Recently WHO welcomed the initial clinical trial results from the United Kingdom that show dexamethasone, a corticosteroid has the potential to save lives of critically ill SARS-CoV-2 patients who have cytokine storm leading to ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome) (Horby et al., 2020; Robinson, 2020) . It exhibits both immunosuppressive and anti-inflammatory effects and halts two phases of inflammation-migration of immune cells and vasodilation. Compounds having such properties also inhibit over activation of macrophages which is one of the main culprits of SARS-Cov-2 . Such chemical-based drugs can initiate many side effects in human body. Usage of dexamethasone for a longer period of time can weaken the capability of body's adrenal glands for producing corticosteroids (BC Cancer Agency, 2014) . For this reason, natural sources need to be promoted that can act as a safe alternative to these drugs (Xian et al., 2020) .",

            "text": "Flavonoids from natural sources have gained extreme importance in the field of research because of their versatile benefits. Several flavonoids have shown to have anticancer activities, antiinflammatory activity, antimicrobial activity, antioxidative activity and few flavonoids also exhibit antiviral property (Cushnie and Lamb, 2005; Kumar et al., 2020; Zandi et al., 2011) . For this study, few flavonoids have been listed out having both anti-inflammatory as well as antiviral properties which exhibited high binding affinity with the spike protein of the SARS-CoV-2 (Cheng et al., 2020; Rathee et al., 2009; Stebbing et al., 2020; Zakaryan et al., 2017) . Function of enzyme systems involved in the generation of inflammatory processes can be affected by the flavonoids (Middleton and Kandaswami, 1992) . They can be classified into various classes such as flavones, anthocyanidins, flavonols, isoflavonoids, flavanones etc. that vary in the oxidation levels and pattern of replacement of the pyrene ring, while within each class individual compounds vary in the substitution of benzene rings. Specific flavonoids have been reported to have exhibited antiviral and anti-inflammatory property very effectively (Dai et al., 2019; Middleton and Kandaswami, 1992) . Table 1 gives the list of compounds to carry out virtual screening to look for the best flavonoid compound having the highest binding affinity with the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. A bioinformatics approach can help predict the interactions of the listed flavonoid compounds with the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. These Interactions are carried out by molecular docking process of the small ligand molecules with the neighboring amino acid residues of the receptor protein (Hosseini and Amanlou, 2020) . These docked compounds can be analyzed based on the estimated binding energy, bonded and non-bonded interactions. Lesser the binding affinity, the more strongly the target molecule and the ligand are attached to and bind to one another (Radwan and Alanazi, 2018) . Molecular dynamics simulation for the best docked protein-ligand complex was carried out to simulate the atomic motions based on Newton's second law for determining the stability of the complex. There are several force fields that govern the molecular dynamics such as AMBER and CHARMM (Abraham et al., 2015) .",

It showed the movement of the ligand within the binding pocket in 1 ns. The plots were made using QtGrace software. Fig. 9 shows the RMSD graph comparing RMSD plots of spike protein bound to naringin ligand and the spike protein without any bound ligands. For the complex, RMSD ranges from 0 to 0.5 nm and for the protein the variation was in range from 0 to 0.42 nm which was comparatively lower. The RMSD of the complex appeared to be more stable when compared to that of the protein from 0.2 nm to 0.4 nm. Root Mean Square Fluctuations (RMSFs) of the docked complex and protein were analyzed to characterize the fluctuations of residues during the 1 ns MD simulation (Fig. 10) .

Naringin compound showed the highest binding affinity of all with the active site of the spike protein and hence further molecular dynamics simulation was conducted on this complex using GROMACS to study the dynamic characteristics. Analyzing the graphs obtained from 1 ns simulation, we concluded that the complex was stable for a time period but not throughout the simulations. By exploring several ligand properties, protein-ligand interactions and the protein stability, the docking study was validated by molecular simulations. Further in vitro analysis can be carried out to prove the effectiveness of naringin flavonoid extracted from natural sources as an inhibitor of the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2.
