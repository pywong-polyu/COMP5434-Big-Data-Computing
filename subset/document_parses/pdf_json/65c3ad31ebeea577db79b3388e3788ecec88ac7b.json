First, dementia tends to have severe mental and behavioral symptoms. Second, due to less activity and long-term bed rest, the incidence of serious complications, such as pressure ulcers, lung infections, and cardiopulmonary insufficiency, is higher in dementia patients than in nondementia patients. Last but not least, inflammation might play an important role in the pathogenesis of dementia [6] [7] [8] . Inflammation is a characteristic of Alzheimer's disease (AD; the most important cause of dementia). AD dementia patients also have different degrees of inflammation [9] . Chronic inflammation is a common feature of various types of vascular dementia (the second most important cause of dementia) [10] . In addition to amyloid protein, inflammatory molecules, including acute inflammatory reactants and inflammatory cytokines, have been found in the cerebrospinal fluid of dementia patients [11] . Peripheral infection will also aggravate the onset and development of AD [12] . However, in another study [13] of general patients with COVID-19, patients with severe cases tended to have higher leukocyte counts and neutrophil-lymphocyte ratios. Therefore, the persistent inflammatory state of dementia patients may be the cause of the increased peripheral blood WBC and neutrophil counts in dementia patients with COVID-19.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 511, "end": 514, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 515, "end": 518, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 519, "end": 522, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 690, "end": 693, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 821, "end": 825, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 1015, "end": 1019, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 1095, "end": 1099, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 1128, "end": 1132, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "At present, there is not enough evidence to support that the renal function damage of dementia patients with COVID-19 is worse than that of patients with other mental disorders. In our study, the inflammatory AGING response of patients with mental disorders was associated with renal impairment, but this phenomenon was not statistically significant in patients with dementia. Therefore, the increase in BUN levels may not be unique to patients with dementia with COVID-19. It may be that these patients have severe symptoms, which lead to damage to renal function. Of course, due to the limitation of the sample size of dementia patients, the trend of the correlation analysis may be masked.
