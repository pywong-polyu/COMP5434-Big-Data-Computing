It is a rare cause of thrombotic microangiopathy characterized by microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (MAHA), severe thrombocytopenia and high risk for ischemic end organ damage secondary to formation of platelet-rich thrombi in the microvasculature (1, 2) . These microthrombi occur in the setting of inadequately cleaved von Willebrand factor (VWF), caused by the absence or severe deficiency of ADAMTS13 (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with a thrombospondin type 1 motif, member 13) activity. ADAMTS13 is a plasma protein first characterized in 2001, that under normal circumstances cleaves von Willebrand factor (VWF) into smaller multimers (3, 4) . Prevention or reversal of end-organ ischemia in TTP is achieved by re-establishing adequate ADAMTS13 enzyme activity, and thereby appropriate VWF cleavage. TTP can be caused by an inherited deficiency of ADAMTST13 activity, resulting in congenital TTP (cTTP). More commonly, however, TTP is due to an acquired deficiency of ADAMTS13 activity resulting from autoantibody-mediated inhibition of plasma ADAMTS13 activity, referred to as immune-mediated TTP (iTTP). Classical forms of TTP may be more readily identified; but atypical presentations of either cTTP or iTTP present significant diagnostic and management challenges. In this review, we discuss the clinical presentation, diagnostic work up and most up to date therapeutic interventions for TTP, a rare but potentially fatal hematologic disease. We highlight the role of genetic testing to differentiate cTTP and iTTP. To illustrate potential diagnostic and therapeutic challenges, we will refer to two cases, both adolescents, presenting with acute hemolytic anemia and thrombocytopenia, ultimately diagnosed with TTP but requiring very different management strategies.",

Severe ADAMTS13 deficiency leads to accumulation and aggregation of platelets via ultra-large VWF multimers. Von Willebrand factor, a glycoprotein required for platelet adhesion, is secreted as ultra-large multimers and stored as such until released into circulation upon vascular injury or endothelial cell activation. Under normal physiological circumstances, ADAMTS13 in peripheral circulation facilitates proteolysis of ultra large VWF multimers into smaller forms to prevent abnormal or disorganized activation, with excessive platelet binding. In TTP, however, ADAMTS13 activity is absent or significantly decreased, leading to abnormal platelet adhesion and aggregation due to uncleaved, ultra large VWF multimers, causing formation of diffuse microthrombi within peripheral vasculature (5) (see Figure 1 ). In most cases (>95%), absence of ADAMTS13 activity is due to acquired autoantibodies against ADAMTS13, inhibiting its proteolytic activity. In a minority of patients (<5%), ADAMTS13 deficiency is due to biallelic mutations within the ADAMTS13 gene leading to an inherited chronic deficiency of ADAMTS13, termed congenital TTP (cTTP).",

Immune mediated TTP (iTTP) represents the vast majority of TTP cases (>95%), generally presenting in late adolescence and early adulthood. Women are more frequently affected than men (~2 to 1). Possible risk factors or triggers that have been linked to iTTP include infections, medications, pregnancy, known autoimmune disease, or evidence of underlying autoimmunity (5) . Congenital TTP (cTTP), also referred to as Upshaw-Schulman syndrome (USS), is a very rare autosomal recessive disorder caused by biallelic homozygous or compound heterozygous variants within the ADAMTS13 gene, leading to severely decreased or absent proteolytic activity. More than 200 ADAMTS13 variants across all ADAMTS13 protein domains on chromosome 9 have been identified in patients with cTTP (including missense, non-sense, splice site, and frameshift mutations). Clinical phenotype of cTTP can be quite heterogeneous. Classically, cTTP is thought to present early in childhood; however, more recent case studies have reported patients with milder or even absent clinical signs of disease in childhood but later developing clinically evident hemolysis or small vessel ischemia. Certain pathologic mutations, specifically p.R1060W homozygosity, have been shown to result in residual ADAMTS13 activity, around 5-10% of normal plasma levels, more frequently resulting in this 'late onset' cTTP (6) . Like iTTP, active thrombotic microangiopathic events in these patients seem to be triggered by an additional exogenous or endogenous event such as medication use or a state of physiological stress, including pregnancy or infection (7) . Importantly however, unlike those with iTTP, all patients with cTTP are at significantly increased risk for transient ischemic attack (TIA) and overt stroke starting at a young age, with up to 20% lifetime incidence of stroke given potential long term ADAMTS13 deficiency (8, 9) .",

However, it is important to note that a higher proportion of pediatric cases represent an initial episode of cTTP highlighting importance for molecular diagnosis. Based on data from the national Registry of the French Reference Center for thrombotic microangiopathies, approximately 35% of newly diagnosed TTP cases in childhood are attributed to cTTP and may present at any age, from neonate to adolescent (10) . Pediatric acquired or immune mediated forms of TTP generally present in late teenage years (11) . Mortality for untreated TTP, both in pediatric and adult patients, approaches 90%.

Some estimates suggest that up to 60% of patients will have neurological symptoms at presentation, ranging from headache to overt stroke or seizures, and up to 25% may have evidence of cardiac or mesenteric ischemia. Renal manifestations however are typically isolated to proteinuria and/or hematuria, with acute renal failure an unusual finding at the time of diagnosis. Based on reports from the Oklahoma TTP registry, the majority of patients with acute iTTP present with a platelet count of <20 x10^9/L, hematocrit <30% and normal to minimally elevated serum creatinine, a finding particularly helpful when differentiating TTP from other forms of TMA, most notably hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) (12, 13) . Because the signs, symptoms, and laboratory markers overlap with other thrombotic microangiopathies, the distinction of a TTP diagnosis relies on determination of ADAMTS13 activity (2, 14) . This is the only biologic marker specific to TTP, and diagnosis is confirmed when ADAMTS13 activity is found to be <10%. However, ADAMTS13 activity levels are often not readily available at the time of presentation in a patient with evidence of MAHA; and in the vast majority of clinical scenarios, the clinician must decide to initiate risky but life-saving therapy before having laboratory confirmation of a TTP diagnosis.",

In physiologic conditions, ultralarge VWF multimers released from endothelial cells are cleaved by ADAMTS13 in smaller VWF multimers, less adhesive to platelets. In TTP, because of the absence of functional ADAMTS13 (either absent by congenital defect or inhibited by specific autoantibodies), ultralarge VWF multimers are released into the blood and bind spontaneously to platelets to form aggregates within the arterial and capillary microvessels. The VWF platelet aggregates are large enough to form microthrombi inducing tissue ischemia, platelet consumption, and microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (schistocytes on blood smear).This figure was originally published in Blood, and re-printed with permission here.

Traditional assays such as ELISA and FRETS-VWF73 are done via incubation of test samples with standard human plasma at varying concentrations, using a standard mixing study. These allow for identification of antibodies leading to ADAMTS13 inhibition in vitro. However, two major limitations of these panels exist: false negatives as well as false positives are possible, particularly with collagen-binding based inhibitor panels as they do not allow for identification of non-inhibitory or nonneutralizing antibodies. These are antibodies that do not lead to proteolytic inhibition in vitro; however, in vivo they lead to severe ADAMTS13 activity deficiency by affecting normal interaction with endothelium or other cellular and plasmatic modulators essential for in vivo activity (19) (20) (21) (22) .

Inhibitor testing suggested the presence of protease inhibitor (0.9 Bethesda equivalent units, reference range <0.4). Given a high suspicion for iTTP he was immediately initiated on frontline therapy for iTTP (described below). However, he did not exhibit desired response, as he had no significant improvement in hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, or overall functional status.

Caplacizumab, a novel agent, has been shown to provide an important therapeutic role in management of iTTP by targeting a portion of the underlying pathophysiology at play. Caplacizumab is a humanized bivalent variable-domain-only immunoglobulin fragment that targets the A1 domain of VWF (30) .

International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) guidelines support the use of upfront caplacizumab for management of iTTP in adults based on the clinical trials described, despite some potential bleeding risks, still to be defined (33, 34) .

In addition, an international registry-based review has shown that despite regular prophylaxis with FFP patients remain at relatively high risk for recurrent episodes of TTP, particularly pediatric patients (35) . Several studies have explored the use of intermediate-purity factor VIII concentrates for both treatment and prophylaxis in congenital TTP, as certain commercially available products have been shown to contain high amounts of ADAMTS13. Use of such products would potentially allow for less frequent infusions, in-home administration, smaller infusion volumes, and decreased risk of blood-born infections or transfusion-related reactions when compared to standard FFP administration. Several case series report their successful use for this population (36, 37) . Studies have analyzed functional and immunoreactive ADAMTS13 in several commercially available products in the US and EU and identified two products (Koate-DVI \u00ae and Alphanate \u00ae ) with high ADAMTS13 activity: 900% and 200%, respectively, compared to activity of 100% in normal pooled plasma, making these products a viable alternative for patients with cTTP (38) . Once molecular diagnosis of cTTP was made for our patient in case 1, immunosuppressive therapy was discontinued and a replacement approach was utilizedinitially with fresh frozen plasma (FFP), and subsequently with the ADAMTS13-containing factor 8 product Koate-DVI \u00ae .
