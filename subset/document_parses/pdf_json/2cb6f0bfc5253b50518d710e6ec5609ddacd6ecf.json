We herein report a rare presentation of complicated sinusitis with pre-septal cellulitis and hard palatal necrosis in a COVID-19 patient. A 52-year-old male was admitted to the hospital with typical COVID manifestations where he had two successive COVID-19 positive swabs. During his admission, he developed symptoms of right orbital complications of sinusitis along with both clinical and radiological evidence of ipsilateral hard palatal necrosis. Imaging confirmed a diagnosis of right pan-sinusitis complicated with right pre-septal infection and hard palatal bony defect on the same side. Our case focuses on the possible association between these manifestations and the known thromboembolic complications of COVID-19. Ongoing management of such complicated rare cases should be through multidisciplinary team.",

In addition, there was radiological bony erosion of the floor of nose on the right side (Fig. 3) . No orbital involvement was noted. After multidisciplinary discussion, he was taken to the theatre the following day where he underwent right ethmoidectomy, uncinectomy and wide middle meatal antrostomy. The right sphenopalatine artery was found thrombosed (Fig. 4) . This was combined with transoral resection of the right palatine process of maxilla. A sample of the discharge was sent for bacteriologic and fungal smear and culture. Immediate palatal reconstruction was performed using a temporary obturator which was replaced 2 weeks later by a permanent one. The smear was negative for both bacterial and fungal elements, and no growth was reported in the culture. The patient's general condition improved and was discharged 4 days later. has been shown to be a multi-systemic disease rather than just a respiratory system infection. One of its main pathophysiological mechanisms is the occurrence of a generalized pro-thrombotic state with resultant microvascular and macrovascular thromboembolism. Han et al. noted that coagulation parameters such as raised D-dimers, fibrin degradation products and fibrinogen correlate with the severity of COVID-19 infection. Also, these parameters were noted to be elevated in milder forms of the disease compared with healthy controls [3] . The mechanism of thrombophilia in SARS-CoV-2 infection is not fully elucidated; however, some putative mechanisms were proposed, including a pro-coagulable cytokine storm, viral tropism for angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors in vascular endothelium and raised antiphospholipid antibodies. Reports of pulmonary embolisms, deep vein thrombosis, cerebral infarction and cerebral venous sinus thrombosis associating COVID-19 infection are increasing in recent literature [4] . In our patient, we have found the right sphenopalatine artery completely thrombosed intraoperatively, and we presume that the right internal maxillary artery, its descending palatine branch or both have also been thrombosed explaining the patient's extensive hard palate necrosis.",

Turbin et al. reported two cases of COVID-19-associated complicated sinusitis with orbital cellulitis. One case developed along a sub-periosteal collection, while the other demonstrated superior ophthalmic vein thrombophlebitis. In both patients, bacterial and fungal smears and cultures remained repeatedly negative [5] . Similarly, our reported patient showed negative bacterial and fungal culture and smear. Albeit, it is uncertain whether SARS-CoV-2 was the sole cause of sinusitis or a contributing factor, the temporal association, normal procalcitonin level and negative bacteriologic and fungal cultures suggest a major role of the virus in its development.",
