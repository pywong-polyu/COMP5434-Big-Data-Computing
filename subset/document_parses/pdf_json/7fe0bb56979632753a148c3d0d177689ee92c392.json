            "text": "Results: Among the 510 candidates who responded, 62.2% applied for medical specialties, 20.2% applied for surgical specialties, and 17.6% applied for critical care and emergency specialties. Most respondents (61.2%) never had previous experience with web-based video conferences. Most respondents (80.2%) used the Zoom application to conduct the current E-interviews, whereas only 15.9% used the FaceTime application. 63.3% of the respondents preferred E-interviews over in-person interviews, and 60.6% rated their experience as very good or excellent. 75.7% of the respondents agreed that all their residency program queries were adequately addressed during the Einterviews. At the same time, 52.2% of them agreed that E-interviews allowed them to represent themselves accurately. 28.2% felt no stress at all with their E-interviews experience, while 41.2% felt little stressed and only 8.2% felt highly stressed. The factors that were independently and inversely associated with applicants' level of stress with E-interviews experience were their ability to represent themselves during the interviews (p = 0.001), costsavings (p < 0.001), their overall rating of the E-interviews quality (p = 0.007) and the speed of the internet connection (p < 0.006). Conclusion: Videoconferencing was implemented on an urgent basis during the COVID-19 pandemic in the medical residency application process in Saudi Arabia. It was perceived as an adequate and promising tool to replace in-person interviews in the future. Applicants' satisfaction was mainly driven by good organization, costsaving, and their ability to present themselves. Future studies to enhance this experience are warranted.",

In fact, interviews yield several pieces of information regarding the applicants that would not be found in their resumes or personal statement and were a chance for the interviewee to see the institution to which they are applying. Several elements other than the portfolio of the applicants should be considered in which every residency review committee will look for in every applicant; these elements include communication skills, attitude, reasons of interest in the specialty and center, honesty, and problem-solving skills, which are best evaluated through personal interview. Alternatively, on-site in-person interviews have many downsides due to cost, travel plans, and time management for both parties. Applicants who are usually from different cities need to fit up to 10 interviews in their tight schedules in a short period together with their own educational and work duties. The other obstacle is the cost of attending all offered interviews, especially if it requires traveling to several cities [1] .",

The SCFHS is the national regulator of postgraduate medical training that involves application, nomination, interviewing, matching, supervising and assessing training programs, qualifying trainees and setting standards for the practice and development of health professions; issuing registration cards and professional classification certificates for all healthcare practitioners in Saudi Arabia. Facing the challenge of infection prevention practices (social distancing and crowd avoidance) during the pandemic, SCFHS decided to substitute face-to-face interviews with E-interviews to reduce the risk of exposing interviewing staff and applicants, who are both healthcare workers and the potential risk of spreading the disease in different health institutions and its disastrous sequelae.",

Comparing in-person interviews with E-interviews, 35.7% of the applicants in our study noted that each of them saved more than 500 SR ($133) without considering saving from the centers' side. Additional cost-saving was one of the independent variables associated with high applicants' satisfaction with Einterviews. A previous study of residency program webbased interview was less costly by a mean of $171 /applicant than in-person interviews [9] . The cost is even higher in other countries, with residency applicants traveling for a median of 3 weeks and spending approximately $4000 [1, 10] .

Furthermore, as some remote interviews might be necessary for some situations, it will reduce the information obtained during the interview.

Two of the three applicants (66.7%) found it helpful, whereas, among the respondents of this study, 22% perceived it as helpful. While our Einterviews were prepared and conducted in an urgent matter, due to the pandemic crisis, future events could benefit from structured preparatory material and training for the E-interviews. Providing applicants with adequate information about this type of interview was performed in other studies and probably eased the interview flow. Furthermore, technology testing and registering software accounts ahead of time were recommended by Aparna Joshi et al. to avoid any obstacles on the event day [20] . They also recommended hiring a technology assistant to intervene whenever needed. Orientation pertaining to cybersecurity, identity theft, teleconferencing fatigue and others are among other important aspects that need to be targeted in E-interview participants. Many factors have hindered the E-interviews experience for applicants; the most encountered factor was a slow or interrupted Internet connection, followed by the absence of clear instructions and the lack of previous experience in teleconferencing, whereas others faced difficulties like not receiving clear emails from the program directors.",

Shah et al. have suggested preventing such problems by establishing a protocol for troubleshooting before the actual interview. They provided written instructions for establishing a software account a month before the videoconference interview, conducting a test call with the program coordinator to verify a successful connection during the preceding week, and offering faculty members who were unfamiliar with the technology a 5min tutorial on the day of the interview [6] .",
