PN mainly affects the skin with poikiloderma, hyperkeratotic nails, generalized hyperkeratosis on palms and soles, and neutropenia. Other less frequent features may be present including short stature, recurrent pulmonary infections, hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, dysmorphisms, hepatosplenomegaly, and laboratory abnormalities (1) . Prognosis strongly depends on recurrent infections and on the risk of developing hematological and skin cancers. Cancer has a significant impact on mortality. Ninety percent of patients with PN have recurrent respiratory issues. Children are typically affected by recurrent otitis media and sinusitis. Several lung conditions can be observed, including infections, bronchiectasis, abscesses, and granulomas, which severely impact on morbidity. Moreover, although frequency of infections reduces dramatically after the first decade, bronchiectasis, productive cough, and reactive airway disease remain during adulthood (1) .",

At 4 months of life, he developed bronchiolitis and, soon after, was referred to our hematology unit due to persistence of neutropenia. At that time, splenomegaly was already present. Following Italian guidelines, he underwent several tests to exclude postinfection, druginduced, autoimmune, and cyclic neutropenia (3). Bone marrow examination showed no arrest of myelopoiesis maturation at the promyelocyte stage (a marker of severe congenital neutropenia) and no infiltration by leukemic or Gaucher cells. Dermatitis was noted at around 5 months and progressively worsened, causing the child to be referred to our dermatology unit.",

Several Civatte bodies were present, as highlighted by high molecular weight cytokeratin (HMW-CK) immunostaining ( Figure 3B) . The second specimen showed histological features compatible with the diagnosis of cutaneous mastocytosis, including a dense cellular infiltrate occupying the superficial dermis; the cells were characterized by moderately abundant, amphophilic, and finely granular cytoplasm and oval-shaped nuclei with clumped chromatin; immunohistochemical investigation demonstrated positivity for CD117 (c-Kit) (Figures 3C,D) . At 8 months of age, a motor developmental delay was diagnosed, and psychomotor rehabilitation was started. The infant was able to sit by 9 months and walk by 18 months.

Recently, at the age of 2.8 years, he had coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) with very mild flu-like symptoms and without complications. One month after a negative molecular test result for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), he received the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine. Five days later, he was admitted because of fever (T max = 39). Hyperferritinemia (3,336 ng/ml), slightly high C-reactive protein (2.31 mg/dl), and neutrophil count reaching 2,000 cell/L were documented. Thoracic radiography excluded pneumonia, abdominal ultrasound simply confirmed the previously noted splenomegaly, urine culture was negative, and procalcitonin value was normal. He was treated with intramuscular ceftriaxone for 5 days and subsequently with oral cephalosporin for 5 more days, with resolution of fever 36 h after the first antibiotic dose. After 10 days of antibiotic therapy, ferritin had decreased to 750 ng/ml and neutrophil count to 600 cell/L. At the last examination, at 2 years and 10 months, his weight was 11.6 kg (\u22121.5 SD), height was 90 cm (\u22121.3 SD), and cranial circumference was 49 cm (just below the median value), compatible with a growth delay.

            "text": "PN (namely Clericuzio-type poikiloderma) is an extremely rare autosomal recessive disease resulting from mutations in USB1 and characterized by a combination of poikiloderma and neutropenia, mainly causing severe respiratory infections. Poikiloderma occurs early in childhood, presenting with the typical features of a reticulated erythema and hyperpigmentation-delimiting hypopigmented atrophic areas. While poikiloderma predisposes to the rare occurrence of skin cancer, respiratory infections and bronchiectasis may be life threatening and lead to a poor prognosis. Patients are prone to develop myelodysplastic syndrome and, rarely, acute myelogenous leukemia in adult age. A wide spectrum of other signs may be observed in PN including hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, osteopenia, hepatosplenomegaly, and other uncommon features (1, 2, (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) (17) . Here, we describe the onset and clinical history of PN, providing useful information for clinicians facing this very rare disease. Our case fits the typical PN phenotype. As expected, postnatal growth delay was present (1) . Neutropenia occurred in the first year of life and was due to dysmyelopoiesis only affecting the granulocyte lineage. The patient also presented mild developmental delay likely related to his perinatal history and suspected hypoxic brain damage rather than the PN diagnosis. While some degree of early developmental delays are reported, intellectual disability has not in fact been associated with PN. Congenital heart defects are not usually present in PN. One patient described by Colombo et al. (8) presented pulmonic stenosis and prolonged QT at ECG; the authors reported a congenital heart defect in another child although without specifying the type. Whether heart findings are incidental or associated with PN needs to be elucidated. In any event, no patients carrying the c.243G>A variant had heart problems. We observed mild, yet persistent elevation of aminotransferases and ferritin as well as splenomegaly and recurrent mild airway infections. Observed facial somatic features of patients with PN included prominent forehead, depression of nasal bridge, midfacial retrusion, and sparse eyelashes and eyebrows. Our patient does not present any particular dysmorphism.",

In addition to poikiloderma, extensively described above, other cutaneous presentations can be observed in PN, such as photosensitivity, pachyonychia, keratoderma of palms/soles, calcinosis cutis, and atrophic plaques (1). In particular, photosensitivity manifests as higher susceptibility to development of acute and chronic damage following sun exposure, thus necessitating the use of sunscreens and physical protections in patients with PN (1). Pachyonychia and palmoplantar keratoderma refer to thickening of nail plates and of the skin of palms/soles, respectively. Both are observed in various skin conditions and cannot be considered specific to PN. Finally, calcinosis cutis and atrophic plaques may be regarded as a direct consequence of poikiloderma (1). Specifically, calcinosis cutis presents with small firm papules or nodules located on elbows, knees, and pinnae, or, rarely, more diffusely.",

Cutaneous mastocytosis (CM) is a common type of mastocytosis, mostly seen in children, with a broad variety of clinical findings, ranging from more frequent cutaneous maculopapular mastocytosis and mastocytoma to rarer telangiectasia macularis eruptiva perstans and diffuse mastocytosis (22) . The incidence of CM is not precisely known, but in the one and only study available, it was found to be 1 per 500 children presenting to pediatric dermatology clinics (23) . CM has an indolent course in childhood and can be considered a benign disease with exceptional systemic signs or symptoms, such as gastrointestinal and cardiovascular symptoms mostly caused by abundant histamine release by mast cells. Due to the hyperproduction of histamine, children with CM experience cutaneous manifestations, including mainly pruritus, erythema, red dermographism, flushing, hives, and Darier's sign, namely, the enlargement and swelling (rarely blistering in the first months of life) of lesions after induced or spontaneous rubbing. Serum tryptase levels may be considered a good marker of systemic involvement of mastocytosis, with a threshold of 20 ng/ml. Prognosis of CM is good, as the disease usually spontaneously resolves by adolescence or adulthood. Treatment with antihistamines and corticosteroids may be necessary for symptom control, and educational information could be useful in limiting Darier's sign elicitation and excessive histamine release (22) .",

            "text": "The association between PN and CM has never been reported before in the literature and could be considered casual, given the relatively common occurrence of mastocytosis in children. It could be argued that a subclinical immunodeficiency might be a triggering factor of mastocytosis in our patient, although this hypothesis seems highly unlikely, as most pediatric mastocytoses are not secondary to immunodeficiency but often to KIT mutations found outside exon 17. Apart from the Clericuzio type of PN, no other forms of syndromic poikiloderma have been associated with mastocytosis. On this basis, we are confident that in our patient, the association was likely coincidental. Notably, bone marrow biopsy excluded a systemic involvement of mastocytosis, which was in any event Frontiers in Medicine | www.frontiersin.org highly improbable given the patient's age and his low levels of serum tryptase. In previously reported cases carrying the c.243G>A mutation in USB1, poikiloderma, persistent neutropenia, recurrent infections, palmoplantar keratoderma, pachyonychia of the great toenails, and photosensitivity are constant features, as expected ( Table 1) . Elevation of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and ferritin levels are also frequent (75% of cases), followed by dental problems and growth failure or short stature. It is worth reporting that neutrophil values appropriately rise (although without achieving levels higher than normal) during infections in at least 60% of patients. Mechanisms leading to this phenomenon should be further studied in order to identify potential molecular pathways and targeted drugs able to increase neutrophil count and hopefully reduce the frequency and severity of infectious diseases. Two sisters described by Porter et al. (20) were diagnosed with cancer; almost all the other cases were very young at the time of presentation. Thus, the risk of developing cancer still needs to be quantified in all such patients.",
