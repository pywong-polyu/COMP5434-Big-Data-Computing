In fact, based on a study by Manyika et al. (2017) , \"technological unemployment\" is expected to reach 800 million jobs by the end of the decade. The optimists predict that new technologies will significantly boost productivity through their impact on energy efficiency, transport (e.g., autonomous vehicles), medicine, and mass production due to the adoption of 3D printing (Dervis, 2014) .",

            "text": "Hand in hand with technological change goes the issue of the creation of oversized technology companies (Big Tech). As happens in the case of banks, size itself is not a problem, but their vast size makes regulatory management and policy-making very difficult. Therefore, Big Tech requires special treatment. Their complexity touches on a number of issues, such as the shift in investment from tangibles to non-tangibles, intellectual property, and brands, and the unequal wealth reallocation (with its consequent political impact, populism, etc.). The latter because of the standard financial practice of increasing shareholder wealth while at the same time stifling start-ups (due to the acquisition strategies of Big Tech) and, by extension, affecting employment. Dervis (2014) distinguishes optimists and pessimists on the basis of their views on four different issues: (a) economic growth and the global economy; (b) income distribution, particularly in the case (Piketty, 2014) where capital becomes a substitute for work (exempted high-skilled work), taking into account that educational systems need time to foster new skill sets but with wage differentials increasing in the meantime; (c) the impact of further automation on employment, since people can thus be \"released\" from mundane jobs; and (d) climate change and possible constraints on natural resources, which may hinder long-term growth or may lead to a transition to green energy economies, reinforcing another technological revolution capable of increasing social prosperity. Brynjolfsson and McAfee (2014) argue that the potential of new technologies is equivalent to the potential of past technologies and can transform the economy. Their optimism stems from their belief in the unlimited possibilities of innovation. More specifically, from the fact that even low-cost devices can now communicate with each other, that new technologies are able to respond to the amount of digital information being generated and that machines nowadays have high computing power.",

            "text": "A basic premise, commonplace among many pessimistic analysts, is their assessment of a slowdown in technological development, including the benefits of economic convergence for developing countries (Rodrik, 2013) . Their main objection to the optimists is that the latter place too much faith in the market operation and its \"ability\" to correct problems. Gordon (2012) notes that the US's rapid economic growth over the last 250 years, may represent a unique event in world history, which will not be repeated anytime soon. He agrees with Krugman (1990) , who argues that slow growth during the period 1973-1990 was a harbinger of a new, more pessimistic future, and where the earlier high expectations of Americans will come down to earth. In addition, he emphasizes that US productivity has fallen significantly since 1970 and that economic growth will slow. In fact, he estimates that over the next decade growth rates will decrease significantly because the innovation impact has been smaller and more limited than previously, particularly since transport and energy technologies have changed little in the last half century. He argues that the high economic growth rates of the previous century were the product of the second industrial revolution , where the discovery and use of new technologies structurally altered economic activity and society (electricity, water, and sanitation, the internal combustion engine, radio and telephone, chemicals and oil, etc.). As such, the economic consequences of this earlier period were considerably more significant than those of the first industrial revolution-the era of the steam engine and railroads-but also more significant than those of the third industrial revolution-the information age and the internet. Rodrik (2013) argues that growth will remain low at best. He believes that the global economy is entering a new phase in which future growth will not be the same as in recent decades, especially for East Asia countries where high growth rates will be difficult to be maintained. He believes that the distance between developed and developing economies is likely to decrease significantly relative to the levels of the last two decades, with developing countries continuing to grow faster than developed ones, but with economic convergence mainly be due to slower growth in developed countries. Jones (2009) believes that the level of innovation will decline significantly in coming years since, as he argues, technological development is expected to significantly and continuously increase the stock of knowledge, resulting in reduced opportunities for innovation by future generations due to technological and cognitive constraints. And while this problem may be compensated for by greater investment in education, but to the detriment of experience, the resulting lack of on-the-job training may lead to reduced innovation at individual level as a greater reliance on teamwork will have a negative impact on economic growth. This is one of the reasons for the lack of growth in productivity witnessed in recent decades, despite an enormous growth in collective research. Jones (2009) stresses that such barriers to knowledge change the nature of innovation, leading to negative consequences for long-term economic growth.",

High debt accumulation burdens deprive future generations of resources. Of course, this applies in cases where debt is channeled toward current consumption. If it is invested, the question then becomes one of investment returns. If investment return is lower than cost, this represents a preference for the present relative to the future, in which case the problem is essentially the same. Blanchard (2019) notes that, since 1980, US government bond yields have been falling steadily, they are now below the nominal rate of economic growth and are expected to remain at correspondingly low levels over the medium term. Asked about the impact of low interest rates on government debt policy, he notes that if the interest rate paid by the government is less than the growth rate, then the intertemporal budget constraint facing the government no longer binds. Thus, when borrowing costs remain below the gross domestic product (GDP) growth rate, debt (as a percentage of GDP) decreases through the debt rollover.",

However, continuing to work from home for professions where this is possible may involve maintaining employee performance, in some cases, or even increasing it. In general, however, teleworking in the midst of the coronary epidemiological crisis (Morikawa, 2020) seems to reduce productivity, as in many cases there is not the necessary technical infrastructure and familiarity to support employees from home, while at the same time the physical presence of employees and the sometime necessary access to an office environment cannot be completely replaced. Additionally, many employees do not have a properly designed workplace or favorable conditions to work remotely in the same efficient manner.

According to Johnson and Papageorgiou (2018) the process of development, and possibly convergence, is not a smooth one and is characterized by significant variations among countries. This should come as no surprise, since the concept of convergence is merely a theoretical construction that characterizes part of the broader dynamic development process. It appears, therefore, that recent optimism surrounding rapid and sustainable convergence is unfounded (Johnson & Papageorgiou, 2018) .

Since the birth of the Greek state, however, economic growth has been accompanied by a series of national, social, and macroeconomic crises (Kalafatis, Demathas, & Petrakis, 2011) . These have affected capital accumulation, labor development, and all the other factors of production and thereby influenced both the quantitative and qualitative characteristics of Greek economic growth, as well as attendant social attitudes and stereotypes in Greek society. Greek income per capita in the 1980s was lower than in countries such as Germany and Italy, but not by a large amount. According to the theory of convergence, the Greek income per capita and these countries should have converged. Instead there was a divergence (Fig. 7 .5) in income per capita, a trend that has become even more marked since the 1980s and which has clearly increased further since 2008, even though these countries were and continue to be important trading partners of Greece. Rodrik (2011) , with regard to economies' convergence, tried to explore whether the difference in growth between the developed and developing world can continue and, in particular, whether developing economies can continue the rapid growth they have experienced during the last decades of the twentieth century. He points out that growth in the developing world should depend not so much on the growth of the developed economies themselves, but on the difference in productivity levels between developed and developing countries, the so-called convergence gap, which remains quite large.",

The reason for this is that faster productivity growth boosts agents' expectations of future income, inducing them to spend more in the present (Lorenzoni, 2009 ). This result creates a positive relationship between increased productivity and employment. However, the Covid-19 pandemic negatively affects expectations for future productivity growth resulting in a demand-driven recession (Fornaro & Wolf, 2020) with reduced employment and manufactured output.",

When demand is high, the return on investment is high, and vice versa. Thus, there is a positive relationship between productivity growth and aggregate demand. Suppose the pandemic creates a negative shock. The initial shock to supply reduces demand but now lower demand pushes businesses to reduce investments, a fact which in turn creates a drop in productivity growth. In turn, lower productivity growth creates a further drop in demand, which again reduces productivity growth. So, a vicious circle is created, a supply-demand doom loop that strengthens the impact of the initial shock on employment and productivity growth.",

The horizontal part of the AD curve (Fornaro & Wolf, 2020) relates to a case where monetary policy is limited by zero interest rates and the economy faces liquidity traps. In this event, a negative productivity shock shifts the supply curve downward and creates two equilibrium points where the economy is in a liquidity trap and both growth and employment are depressed. This second equilibrium can then be thought of as a stagnation trap (Benigno & Fornaro, 2018) . At which of the two equilibrium points the economy will be located at depends on the expectations of economic agents. Pessimistic animal spirits can push the economy into a stagnation trap.",

Also, the speed with which economies will recover will play an important role, as the stronger the recovery, the more implemented policies will seem procyclical. Finally, China's role in the global economy has changed, and with deflationary exports in the past, it is likely to develop into an element of inflationary pressure in the future.",
