A multi example learning student engagement assessment method based on a one-dimensional convolutional neural network is proposed. Based on the conceptual composition of student engagement, head posture, eye gaze, and eye-opening and closing states and the most used facial movement units are used as visual features. For feature extraction, the proposed view of relative change features, based on the video features extracted from the Open Face toolset, the standard deviation of the distance between adjacent multiple frames relative to the center point of the three visual features is used as the relative change features of the video. This results in the phenomenon that students are highly motivated in the early stage and significantly increase the rate of absenteeism in the later stage. With the development of information technology injecting new vitality into educational innovation, many researchers have introduced computer vision and image processing technology into students' online learning activities, and understand students' current learning situation by analyzing students' learning status. There are relatively few studies in this area in classroom teaching. Considering the low relative position correlation of the features in the examples, the examples are analyzed using a one-dimensional convolutional neural network to obtain the example-level student engagement, and a multi-example pooling layer is used to infer the student engagement in the video from the example-level student engagement. Finally, the experimental method is used to apply the student classroom attention evaluation detection system to actual classroom teaching activities, and the effectiveness and accuracy of the design of the student classroom attention evaluation detection system are investigated in depth through specific applications and example analysis, and the accuracy of the method of this paper is further verified by communicating feedback with teachers and students in the form of interviews.",

However, there are also some problems with online classroom teaching, because of the weak constraint of online teaching, resulting in the phenomenon of students' high motivation in the early stage and significantly higher absence rate in the later stage [1] . Make synchronized classroom videos more fun, interactive, and experiential. For Internet education, it is very necessary to use deep learning computer vision technology to improve the quality of Internet education courses. Therefore, the introduction of intelligent technology to collect students' learning behaviors, analyze students' learning situations, and make comprehensive process evaluation of students, based on the evaluation results, teachers can understand students' learning situation in time and adjust teaching contents and strategies according to the right remedy, which is of great research value to improve students' overall learning quality [2] . The use of a manual recording of teaching videos has great limitations for many recordings, and the recorded video is only a single, boring record of the classroom. Therefore, automation, intelligence, and interactivity of the recording process are of great importance for synchronous classroom recording. The application of an intelligent and automatic recording system can better record the teacher's lecture, students' listening, and students' interaction with the teacher, making the synchronous classroom video more interesting, interactive, and experiential. For Internet education, it is necessary to use computer vision technology of deep learning to improve the quality of Internet education courses.",

For the students, by paying attention to the teacher's head posture, they can understand the teacher's attention direction in time to realize the information interaction between the teacher and the students [3] . In addition, psychological studies have found a correlation between the direction of human head posture and psychological state. The study of students' head posture has become an important research direction to focus on the change of students' learning status, and through the study of students' head posture, we can understand students' learning status and make early decisions to promote students' development.

With the development of machine learning, computer vision, deep learning, and other technologies as well as hardware devices, we can take different forms of information captured by the camera as an input to the computer, and through a series of algorithms such as deep learning and computer vision, the computer can have the ability to understand the information like a human, to obtain the results we need. In this paper, we use machine learning and deep learning methods to visually detect the lecturer and rising students in the classroom to restore the classroom teaching more realistically, which has a very positive effect and impact on the synchronous classroom on the Internet. The time and space separation of teachers and students is a significant feature of AI online education, which has advantages and disadvantages, bringing us a convenient new type of education, but also creating the problem of difficulty to evaluate the effectiveness of education. We know that the evaluation of classroom teaching effect can be determined by students' status, and in the classroom context, students' concentration on the classroom is the primary requirement for education, so concentration judgment becomes one of the necessary ways to monitor the classroom effect. By judging students' concentration in the video content, we can solve the problem of unmonitored students' status in the classroom, and effectively detect when students do not appear in front of the camera or doze off during the class. Therefore, concentration detection has great research significance for the part of emotional deficiency in the process of online education.",

The video and caption layout are used as independent variables based on the MOOC teaching interface to analyze students' attention problems in online education mainly through eye movements. Eye movement recognition combined with expression recognition to count eye blinks and pupil changes to determine the learners' wakefulness, interest, and pleasure levels, and thus evaluate the classroom [6] . The same study analyzes students' eye movements and concentration levels, and they use specialized eye-movement equipment to obtain information. This type of method has good results, but since ordinary camera equipment cannot capture eye and pupil movements, a major feature of this type of method is that it requires professional equipment to obtain students' eye characteristics and track eye rotation to determine the learners' activity level, so it has some reference value in experimental settings and specific scenarios. However, this type of method has some limitations because online education using objects may use different devices [7] .",

The face detection method based on a priori knowledge is to apply certain face detection rules and methods to accurately describe the features of various faces and their interrelationships. For example, if two facial features of a person exist in a face image at the same time, and in the face, a priori features it is usually assumed that a nose, a mouth, and a set of symmetrical eyes will exist on the face [12] . This detection method has certain problems, it relies on clear machine recognition rules, and the establishment of machine recognition rules is a complex process, if the face detection rules formulated too strictly, it may directly cause the failure of face detection because it cannot pass all the rules; if the face detection rules are vague and too general, some wrong information may be accepted to affect the detection accuracy. Moreover, the external environment factors are diverse, and it is impossible to apply a unified detection rule to describe all face information. Therefore, this research method can only be used for face detection under some simple backgrounds and fixed poses. Since the face detector was proposed, methods such as integral map, and cascade structure have rapidly become the main tools for face detection. There are certain problems with this detection method.

Finally, teachers and students agreed that the student classroom attention evaluation detection system is easy to operate and use with high accuracy, which is a good facilitator for classroom teaching, as shown in Figure 7 .",

Through interviews with students, it was learned that the students watched the video playback after class and believed that the evaluation results of the students' 9 Occupational Therapy International classroom attention evaluation and detection system were in line with the current learning state and had high accuracy. Individuals with higher psychological resilience tend to treat life's unsatisfactory changes as special tests, and they are optimistic about such changes. Optimism is an individual's positive cognitive evaluation, not only in the face of sudden change situations, but they also show a positive expectation when faced with the teacher role, as shown in Figure 8 .",

For example, the 4 videos, with more eyes closed in contemplation, is characterized by the fact that although the proportion of eyes in the closed state is larger, it cannot be judged singularly as having entered fatigue because its mouth does not show the performance in the related fatigue state. In addition, the fifth video characterized by a lower proportion of frames with eyes closed, but the frequency of yawning was obviously higher, and the mouth opened and closed widely for 50 consecutive frames, so it could judge to be fatigued. In this experiment, a total of 50 video streams to be tested were input, each of which was 20 seconds, either in fatigue or in normal, and 46 videos were judged correctly, with an accuracy rate of 92%, achieving the expected goal of the experiment.",

Therefore, it can be judged that it belongs to the fatigue state. In this experiment, a total of 50 video streams to be tested were input, each of 20 seconds, either in fatigue or normal, 46 videos were judged correctly, the accuracy rate was 92%, and the expected goal of the experiment was achieved. The face detection module is responsible for recognizing whether there is a human face in the video, eliminating excess noise interference, and locating the detected face feature points, while the fatigue detection module is responsible for recognizing the changes in students' eyes and mouths, determining whether students are fatigued, and then analyzing the students' concentration level. The system is tested and evaluated to understand the accuracy and real-time performance of the analysis system, and then two strategies are proposed to improve the realtime performance and accuracy of the system. In this paper, the cascaded convolutional neural network is used to accurately locate the facial feature points of the face, which provides a strong guarantee for the estimation of students' head posture. Four student classroom emotional features are proposed based on the emotional changes of students' classroom learning, and the comprehensive evaluation and analysis of students' attention are realized by combining the changes of students' head posture and facial expression features. The experimental results and analysis show that the system has good accuracy and stability, and at the same time can effectively analyze students' attention in a classroom environment, which provides a research direction for the modernization of education and more software into the classroom environment.",
