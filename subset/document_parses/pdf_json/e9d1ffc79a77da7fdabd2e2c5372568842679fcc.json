            "text": "Governments, Healthcare, and Private Organizations in the global scale have been using digital tracking to keep COVID-19 outbreaks under control. Although this method could limit pandemic contagion, it raises significant concerns about user privacy. Known as \"Contact Tracing Apps\" , these mobile applications are facilitated by Cellphone Service Providers (CSPs), who enable the spatial and temporal realtime user tracking. Accordingly, it might be speculated that CSPs collect information violating the privacy policies such as GDPR, CCPA, and others. To further clarify, we conducted an in-depth analysis comparing privacy legislations with the realworld practices adapted by CSPs. We found that three of the regulations (GDPR, COPPA, and CCPA) analyzed defined mobile location data as private information, and two (T-Mobile US, Boost Mobile) of the five CSPs that were analyzed did not comply with the COPPA regulation. Our results are crucial in view of the threat these violations represent, especially when it comes to children's data. As such proper security and privacy auditing is necessary to curtail such violations. We conclude by providing actionable recommendations to address concerns and provide privacy-preserving monitoring of the COVID-19 spread through the contact tracing applications.",

Thus, understanding users' data privacy, especially for the technological devices they use, such as smartwatches, mobile devices, wearable Internet of Things (IoT) devices, and smart tablets, is very critical [1] , [2] , [3] , [4] , [5] . These devices have infiltrated everyone's daily lives, especially when it comes to mobile devices and are used for multiple day-to-day activities [6] . According to the GSMA Intelligence report in November of 2019, 91% of United States consumers own a Smartphone device [7] . These smartphone devices are connected through Cellphone Service Providers (CSPs) who enable the network connections to communicate and provide the internet connectivity to utilize several smartphone features [8] . Given the nature of modern inter-connected communication, these CSPs obtain a lot of personal data from different types of interactions [9] . Thus, providing transparency, and ensuring user trust in the privacy policies implemented by these CSPs are of the utmost importance [10] . The recent class-action lawsuit against CSPs for selling user historic movement records to third parties further proves the criticality of such situation [11] .",

Among these are the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) and the New York SHIELD Act (Stop Hacks and Improve Electronic Data Security). Additionally, the United States protects children's data rights through the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (COPPA) and the health data rights of insured patients under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA).

The GDPR applies to any company servicing European citizens and residents; as such, CSPs should be following the regulations provided by the GDPR for European citizens, if not all their users, despite the location of the EU citizens on which they are based. Another national legislation, the Lei Geral de Prote\u00e7\u00e3o de Dados Pessoai(LGPD), is enforced in Brazil and for its citizens worldwide [32] . The LGPD was heavily influenced by the GDPR and enforces similar regulations regarding MLD [33] .

After that, we evaluated how the CSPs comply with these regulations, especially when it comes to MLDs.

From data collection to data handling, utilizing a privacy framework is an integral part of constructing a thorough, transparent, and user-focused privacy policy, as well as judging a privacy policy's effectiveness. Along these lines, Liu proposes a framework for location data privacy founded on location anonymization where they looked into several security-and privacy-focused algorithms such as Kanonymity [45] . A similar concept was introduced by Beresford and Stajano [46] with a location privacy protecting framework, based on frequently changing pseudonyms that allow users to be anonymous. They detailed the effectiveness of providing noise into the data set to avoid identification of users based on precise location and user data.",

The proposed generalized framework is used for both designing a privacy respecting system as well as evaluating the privacy impact of existing systems. In a different approach, Ahamed et al. proposes the elimination of third party location anonymizers through the use of probabilistic anonymity that is calculated based on historic Wi-Fi Access Point data [48] . The purpose being keeping data from being passed between parties unnecessarily, and instead approach the storage of location data only as Wi-Fi access point locations. In theory this will allow data subjects to maintain anonymity from the get-go. On the other hand, Lee et al. suggests using a location privacy preserving mechanism which receives actual location events and outputs observations or manipulations of this event [49] , the goal being to maintain data obfuscation even after an adversary has gained access to the data, allowing for anonymity.",

Though colloquially many might mention that privacy and security are inversely proportional, this is not true. Thus, in this framework, the author details on the development of security measures throughout the life-cycle of the data which the users want protected. 6) Visibility and Transparency: While discussing on some auditing protocols, the author says that organizations should be \"operating according to the stated promises and objectives\" . This is also critical from the legal perspectives. 7) Respect for User Privacy: This is extremely critical from multiple vectors, such as the user side, ethical and legal perspective, as well as software development perspective.

Less frequently, MLD is provided by a data subject, however it is important to note that this location data is usually in the form of a data subject's zip code and home address and is not active MLD (precise location). It is vital that this information is included in a CSP's privacy policy, because the majority of MLD is collected in an automated way, and it is often easy for consumers to forget about these processes. Furthermore, MLD received by most CSPs is anonymized in aggregate reports, but fewer CSPs retained the MLD only as long as needed , which can be concerning. In fact, privacy policies often do not go into specifics in regards to data processing or protection, as such it is difficult for the users to assess how effective and thorough any of the details mentioned in the privacy policies are.",

All but one CSP privacy policy analyzed in this study state that they will provide MLD to emergency or legal services if requested. Currently, this is being used primarily to convict criminals by placing them at the scene of a crime, or by emergency response teams to locate a person in need of help 1 .

If CSPs wish to use MLD for contact tracing, it would be most advantageous and regulation compliant to adjust their privacy policy in order to keep each data subject informed.
