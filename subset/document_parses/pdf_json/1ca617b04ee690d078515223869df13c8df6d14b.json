We aimed to investigate the role of cardiac and lung ultrasound, together with clinical variables, to propose a simple score to help predict short-term mortality in these patients. Material and methods: We collected clinical and laboratorial data, and a point-of-care cardiac and lung ultrasound was performed in the first 36 h of admission in the ICU. Results: Out of 78 patients (61 \u00b1 12y-o, 55% male), 33 (42%) died during the hospitalization. Deceased patients were generally older, had worse values for SOFA score, baseline troponin levels, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), LV diastolic function, and increased epicardial fat thickness (EFT), despite a similar prevalence of severe lung ultrasound scores. Based on the multivariable model, we created the POCOVID score, including age (>60 years), myocardial injury (LVEF<50% and/or usTnI>99til), and increased EFT (>0.8 cm). The presence of two out of these three criteria identified patients with almost twice the risk of death. Conclusions: A higher POCOVID score at ICU admission can be helpful to stratify critical COVID-19 patients with increased in-hospital mortality and to optimize medical resources allocation in more strict-resource settings.",

The lung injury is the leading complication requiring intensive care for COVID-19 patients, with intensive care units (ICU) mortality reaching 41.6% [2, 3] . Worse prognosis with aging could be attributed to a senescent immune system response [4] , and the presence of clinical comorbidities. A wider set of risk factors, including cardiac injury [5, 6] , has been associated with more severe disease [7] . Obesity is particularly relevant for disease severity, as seen in the inverse association between BMI and age in ICU hospitalizations [8] . Beyond the presence of associated comorbidities, potential mechanisms attributed to the obesity effect on COVID-19 severity are the impairment of respiratory mechanics, and a worse immune response in the presence of a proinflammatory state [9] . Visceral fat has a high inflammatory activity, which might help triggering the cytokine storm seen in the inflammatory stage [10] . Epicardial adipose tissue is an ectopic fat depot related to total visceral fat [11] and previous studies suggested that EAT volume could be associated with severe forms of COVID and COVID myocarditis [12, 13] . However, the integration of all these risk factors is not easily applicable to risk-stratify patients at bedside care.",

            "text": "The COVID-19 patients' mortality requiring ICU assistance is very high, and simple and quick patient stratification may help to optimize patient care. This is particularly sensitive during COVID-19 pandemic, in which efficient allocation of resources can be crucial for patient care and hospital management. Notably, the mortality rates in our institution were similar to the previously reported in a metaanalysis that included 10,150 patients from centers across Asia, Europe, and North America [3] , but lower than the numbers recently published from a Brazilian analysis (hospital mortality in the Southern Brazil was 55.5%) [21] . Despite originating from a reference hospital, these numbers suggest the characteristics of our sample are likely to be representative of a wide range of medical institutions involved in COVID-19 care during the pandemic. There is already a large body of evidence reinforcing our findings, which state that old age is one of the main determinants of worse prognosis in COVID-19 patients [22] . Although more recent data suggest a higher number of younger patients with critical COVID-19, hospitalizations and disease lethality is highly dependent on age [23] .",

In a prospective multicenter survey, including 1216 patients, 38% of COVID-19 patients presented LV impairment in the hospital setting [25] and a systematic review showed that most COVID-19 myocarditis has reduced LVEF [26] . However, LV dysfunction cannot be attributed to COVID-19, since preexistent cardiac disease is not adequately documented in a relevant proportion of patients. Jain et al. demonstrated that, despite 35% of the patients have presented LV dysfunction in the hospitalization, only about 10% could be related to COVID-19 [27] . Moreover, myocardial injury could be a consequence of multisystem organ dysfunction and not the primary cause of death.",

It has been proposed that visceral fat is a reservoir of SARS-Cov2, facilitating viral spread and increasing immune response activity [30] . Deng et al. suggested that visceral adiposity is a risk factor for COVID-19 complications in young adults [23] . Then, Iacobelis et al., studying 41 elderly hospitalized COVID-19 patients found differences in EAT density from computed tomography (CT) across the disease severity [31] and Abrishami et al. showed that EAT density was associated with higher mortality (n = 100) [32] . Recently, Grodecki et al. showed that EAT measures from CT were independently associated with extent of pneumonia, clinical deterioration, and death [12] , suggesting that this tool may be used in clinical risk stratification. Although thoracic CT is routinely performed in COVID-19 patients, the EAT estimation with EFT measured at bedside cardiac ultrasound may help to estimate the risk profile in patients with critical illness.",

This finding could be attributed to the extension of lung compromise in our critical COVID-19 patients. The main reason for ICU admission was respiratory failure, which is strongly related to the extension of lung involvement [33, 34] . Similarly, the assessment of patients in the more severe spectrum of the disease may justify the prognostic insensitivity of right ventricular echocardiographic parameters, which have been associated with COVID-19 severity in other studies [25] . To this point, few studies proposed scores that predict clinical outcomes in COVID-19 patients. Some studies included clinical risk factors as predictors of disease progression [35] , but do not integrate clinical, laboratorial and ultrasound bedside features into one score [36, 37] . This is the first study that includes epicardial fat tissue as a marker of disease activity, giving it a pivotal role of echocardiographic analysis in critical COVID-19.",

Moreover, our study completed the inclusion of patients in the early stage of the pandemic period which could potentially limit the generalizability of our results in the vaccinated population and in the presence of emergent mutations in COVID-19. These results should be interpreted cautiously due to the relatively small sample size and pending external validation. A potential limitation is that bedside ultrasound image acquisition quality is dependent on examiners' skills, and it is expected technically difficult due to patient's body habitus, positioning, and ICU complex support equipment. This could lead to an increased proportion of non-diagnostic exams. However, that does not seem to be a serious limitation, as our data were acquired by two examiners, still in ICU training, who were not echocardiographers.",
