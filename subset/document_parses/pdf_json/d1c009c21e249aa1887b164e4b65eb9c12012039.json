            "text": "The novel Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a highly contagious virus and has spread all over the world, posing an extremely serious threat to all countries. Automatic lung infection segmentation from computed tomography (CT) plays an important role in the quantitative analysis of COVID-19. However, the major challenge lies in the inadequacy of annotated COVID-19 datasets. Currently, there are several public non-COVID lung lesion segmentation datasets, providing the potential for generalizing useful information to the related COVID-19 segmentation task. In this paper, we propose a novel relationdriven collaborative learning model to exploit shared knowledge from non-COVID lesions for annotation-efficient COVID-19 CT lung infection segmentation. The model consists of a general encoder to capture general lung lesion features based on multiple non-COVID lesions, and a target encoder to focus on task-specific features based on COVID-19 infections. Features extracted from the two parallel encoders are concatenated for the subsequent decoder part. We develop a collaborative learning scheme to regularize feature-level relation consistency of given input and encourage the model to learn more general and discriminative representation of COVID-19 infections. Extensive experiments demonstrate that trained with limited COVID-19 data, exploiting shared knowledge from non-COVID lesions can further improve state-of-the-art performance with up to 3.0% in dice similarity coefficient and 4.2% in normalized surface dice. In addition, experimental results on large scale 2D dataset with CT slices show that our method significantly outperforms cutting-edge segmentation methods on all evaluation metrics. Our proposed method promotes new insights into annotation-efficient deep learning for COVID-19 infection segmentation and illustrates strong potential for real-world applications in the global fight against COVID-19 in the absence of sufficient high-quality annotations.

[28] propose a U-Net based segmentation network to incorporate To exploit shared knowledge from non-COVID-cases, an additional data flow in orange is adopted. By regularizing feature-level relation consistency of given input, the model is encouraged to explore semantic information from both COVID-19 and non-COVID cases. Since the general encoder is applied to utilize non-COVID data and assist in the learning of COVID-19 segmentation as an auxiliary branch, we only employ the skip connections between the target encoder and shared decoder for the fusion of multi-scale features as shown in the top right corner. spatial and channel attention for better feature representation. Other than fully supervised learning, Zheng et al. [29] develop a weakly-supervised approach to investigate the potential for automatic detection of COVID-19 based on patient-level label. Fan et al. [30] present a lung infection segmentation network for 2D CT slices with semi-supervised strategy. Wang et al. [31] propose a noise-robust framework to learn from noisy labels for the pneumonia lesion segmentation task. Yao et al. [32] use a set of operations to synthesize lesion-like appearances for label-free segmentation. Ma et al.

As shown in Table III , it is observed that all our methods can achieve better performance on all metrics compared with fully supervised methods, showing the effectiveness of our method. Besides, the usage of L G rc and L T rc can both further improve the segmentation performance compared with baseline. When removing the target relation consistency, the average segmentation performance of five folds is degraded by 0.4% and 0.2% on DSC and NSD, respectively. The result proves that the usage of target relation consistency loss L T rc can enforce the target encoder to be more discriminative, so as to improve the segmentation performance. However, the improvement is susceptible to the domain difference. Besides, we also conduct experiments of our backbone by removing the general relation consistency loss L G rc . In this way, the general encoder is frozen and are not updated during the training procedure, which means that the knowledge transfer is not available. The experimental results demonstrate that the average segmentation performance is degraded by 0.6% and 0.3% on DSC and NSD, showing the importance of knowledge transfer in our collaborative learning scheme. Some segmentation results of our method and 3D nnUNet are illustrated in Fig.3 for visual comparison. As shown in the figure, our method can generate segmentation results with Note: * denotes the results from [18] where additional non-COVID datasets are used. more accurate boundaries in Fig.3 (a)(b) , and less segmentation mistakes in small infection areas in Fig.3 (c)(d)(e).

Besides, as a simple and intuitive approach, pre-training segmentation models on non-COVID cases and fine-tuning on COVID-19 cases are utilized as comparison results for learning from both COVID-19 and non-COVID cases. The quantitative experimental results are shown in Table IV . From the results, we can observe that transferring pre-trained models to COVID-19 infection segmentation tasks can generally improve the performance of training from scratch with only COVID-19 cases on most experiments, and using multi-lesion is superior to single-lesion when more general representations can be utilized to help COVID-19 infection tasks, with 2.3% and 1.7% improvements in DSC and NSD, respectively. However, these transfer learning methods show instability under different data distribution in five-fold cross validation experiments. The rationale is that the transfer ability largely depends on the domain difference between datasets. When there exists a large domain distance between non-COVID and limited COVID-19 training cases, transfer learning may somehow mislead the learning procedure.",

However, their workflow is still based on transfer learning, that training a network first on non-COVID cases and then on COVID-19 cases with foregoing pre-trained parameters. The main limitation is that the learning procedures of two tasks are separate. Therefore, the shared knowledge of non-COVID and COVID-19 cases cannot be fully exploited. It is observed that our method takes advantage of collaborative learning between two encoders and interactively improves the overall learning procedure. As a consequence, our method achieves higher segmentation performance with an averaged DSC of 70.3% and averaged NSD of 74.2%. Comparing with training from scratch, exploiting shared knowledge from non-COVID lesions can achieve further improvements with up to 3.0% in DSC and 4.2% in NSD.

Some previous studies also highlight the usage of non-COVID lung lesions [18] , [42] . However, these existing approaches merely focus on investigating the transferability in COVID-19 infection segmentation. Although their results reveal benefits of pre-training on non-COVID datasets, the improvement is limited when shared knowledge between COVID-19 and non-COVID lung lesions cannot be fully utilized. Our experiment reveal that the proposed collaborative learning scheme can effectively exploit shared semantic information by regularizing the consistency between extracted features and promote the training procedure in the absence of sufficient high-quality COVID-19 data. In addition, our scheme can be extended to utilize unlabeled COVID-19 data for feature relation regularization. Experimental results show that even without annotations, our method can use unlabeled scans to explore feature relation and achieve more consistent and robust learning. Fig.7 presents an example of challenging cases for COVID-19 lung infection segmentation. Although our method can achieve significant improvement by exploiting knowledge from non-COVID lesions, the limitation still exists. We observe that comparing with ground truth, there are still some mis-segmented areas when encountering challenging cases with multiple irregular infections. As a near future work, we intend to explore how to achieve more robust and reliable knowledge transfer. In addition, we also plan to extend our method to other medical image segmentation tasks to explore the usage of out-of-domain datasets for annotationefficient deep learning, thus enhancing the applicability of these methods in real-world applications.",

Specifically, the model consists of two encoders with the same architecture and a shared decoder. The general encoder is adopted to capture general lung lesion features based on multiple non-COVID lesions and the target encoder is adopted to focus on task-specific feature of COVID-19 infection. To exploit shared knowledge from non-COVID lesions, we develop a collaborative learning scheme to regularize the relation between extracted features of given input for the training. We present a set of experiments on 2D slices and 3D volumes based on three COVID-19 datasets and two non-COVID datasets. Experimental results reveal clear benefits of utilizing non-COVID lesions in the absence of sufficient COVID-19 annotations to train a robust segmentation model. Moreover, we provide a semi-supervised learning solution to utilize the unlabeled COVID-19 cases for feature relation regularization and achieved performance improvements. Among all comparison experiments, our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods and illustrates strong potential for real-world applications in the global fight against COVID-19. ",
