[6] Life-threatening COVID-19 presentations are commonly characterized by acute respiratory distress syndrome, multiorgan failure, hyperinflammatory responses and thromboembolic manifestations, among others. [7] Therefore, it is comprehendible that the mortality rate in severe and critically ill COVID-19 patients is high, [8] particularly when complemented with poor prognostic factors such as comorbidities, elevated inflammatory biomarkers and old age. [3, 7] The variability in presentation necessitated the development of risk stratification tools that would allow early identification of COVID-19 patients at higher risk of mortality, using readily available objective criteria. [8] [9] [10] Accordingly, Knight et al. [8] utilized The International Severe Acute Respiratory and emerging Infections Consortium (ISARIC) World Health Organization Clinical Characterization Protocol to develop and validate such a tool, the ISARIC 4C mortality score (hereafter referred to as ISARIC), which likely outperforms other risk stratification models. [11] The ISARIC mortality score utilizes variables that are readily available on hospitalization, thereby avoiding reliance on parameters such as radiological imaging or those that only become available after ICU admission. [12, 13] The model has been demonstrated to have a high discriminatory ability for in-hospital mortality and categorizes patients into four categories of severity with a uniformly increasing mortality risk [Supplementary Table 1 ].",

For the pandemic, almost half of the beds were converted to single rooms, and all beds are fully equipped with capabilities of invasive and noninvasive monitoring and ventilation. The admission criteria of COVID-19-positive patients to the ICU were broad, as the center serves as a COVID-19 referral center of the region. COVID-19 was confirmed by nasopharyngeal reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and patients were admitted if they had any of the following: supplemental oxygen of any kind to maintain peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO 2 ) \u226592%, mechanically ventilated, any level of consciousness disturbance or respiratory rate \u226528 per minute. The criteria were the same during both waves of COVID-19 and in line with the COVID-19 management recommendations of the Saudi Ministry of Health.

Although this is uncommon in external validation studies, higher AUCs were similarly reported by van Dam et al. [9] (AUC = 0.84; 95% CI: 0.79-0.88) and Wellbelove et al. [18] (AUC = 0.83; 95% CI: 0.71-0.95). Other studies have reported AUC values similar to the validation study [19] or lower. [10] This variation among studies -although minimal -utilizing the same prediction model may be a reflection of the variations in the studied populations, with regard to their demographic characteristics, clinical severity and sample size. For example, in our study, various ethnic groups were included, the age range was wide (from 18 to 104 years) and there was an unequal gender distribution (males: 76.3%). Furthermore, our cohort included only patients admitted to the ICU, which means that they presented a more critical picture of the disease, while the original study enrolled all hospital admissions. Regardless of those variations, all studies in the literature, including ours, found , that is, a directly proportional relationship between mortality risk and increase in score. This reflects that the model performs optimally, especially when considering that the higher mortality rates were higher within all groups in our study compared with the original study. [8] In our analysis, the optimal cutoff value associated with Youden's index was a score >9, with this value correctly classifying 72.7% of the cohort.",

This is also reflected in the fact that our study had a higher mortality rate compared with the study by Knight et al. [8] (38% vs. 32.2%, respectively). One of the most important diagnostic parameters is NPV, which indicates the probability of survival in patients with scores \u22649. In our model, NPV was 80.2% (95% CI: 78.2-82.4), which provides a reasonable risk probability to guide clinical decision making; this discrimination was supported by our finding of a significantly higher survival of patients with scores \u22649, shorter ICU LOS, and lower mortality.",
