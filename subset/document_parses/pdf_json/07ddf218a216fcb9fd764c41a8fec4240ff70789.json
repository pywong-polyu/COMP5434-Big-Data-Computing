High specific antibodies are powerful tool for the development of immunoassay and providing passive immunotherapy against SARS-CoV-2 and expected with large scale production. SARS-CoV-2 S1 protein was expressed in E. coli BL21 and purified by immobilized metal affinity chromatography, as antigen used to immunize hens, the specific IgY antibodies were extracted form egg yolk by PEG-6000 precipitation, and the titer of anti-S1 IgY antibody reached 1:10,000. IgY single chain variable fragment antibody (IgY-scFv) was generated by using phage display technology and the IgY-scFv showed high binding sensitivity and capacity to S1 protein of SARS-CoV-2, and the minimum detectable antigen S1 protein concentration was 6 ng/\u00b5L. The docking study showed that the multiple epitopes on the IgY-scFv interacted with multiple residues on SARS-CoV-2 S1 RBD to form hydrogen bonds. This preliminary study suggests that IgY and IgY-scFv are suitable candidates for the development of immunoassay and passive immunotherapy for COVID-19 to humans and animals.",

There are no specific drugs available for COVID-19 at present (Le Bert et al. 2020; Long et al. 2020) . The pathogen, SARS-CoV-2, is positive-sense singlestranded RNA virus with a genome of approximately 30 kbp encodes four structural proteins, including spike, envelop, matrix and nucleocapsid (Kim et al. 2021) . The spike (S) protein comprises two components: S1, which contains the distinct receptor binding domain (RBD); S2, which contains the fusion peptide. The viruses enter the host cells through the interaction of the RBD with host cell receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) . Antibodies against the S1 subunit, particularly targeting to RBD, are expected to prevent the viral particle surface protein from binding to the ACE2 receptor, thus preventing viral invasion (Parray et al. 2020) . Therefore, the SARS-CoV-2 S1 protein has been accepted as ideal target for antibody and vaccine design (Premkumar et al. 2020; Parray et al. 2020) . Furthermore, antibodies are the powerful tool for the development of point-of-care testing (POCT) immunoassay in SARS-CoV-2 analysis, the desired method should be accurate, specific, rapid, robust and inexpensive (Seo et al. 2020; Kim et al. 2021) .",

Furthermore, in the recent decades, monoclonal IgY, particularly the IgY-scFv can be generated by using the phage display technology to better combine the biological superiorities of both IgY and recombinant antibody fragment (smaller size), is gaining increasing attention and application (Lee et al. 2017) . The chicken monoclonal IgY-scFv has a high binding capacity to targeted pathogens (Chi et al. 2002; Wang et al. 2006; Pavoni et al. 2006) , and it can overcome the difficulties in generating highly specific monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) from the traditional way of antibody generation, such as advantages of low cost and high yield (Groves and Morris 2000) . Our previous studies demonstrated that IgY-scFv can be generated and applied in different immunoassays for the detection of small molecules gentamicin (Li et al. 2016 ) and large molecules CPV-VP2 (Ge et al. 2020) in the veterinary practice. It has been reported that scFv antibodies generated by using phage display technology has high neutralizing effect against SARS-CoV infection (Sui et al. 2004; Kang et al. 2006) .",

The large phylogenetic distance between mammals and birds allow IgY antibodies to recognize certain mammalian conserved protein epitopes (H\u00e4dge et al. 1980; Zhang et al. 2017; P\u00e9rez de la Lastra et al; . The neutralized IgY antibodies, particularly the polyclonal IgY, as a potential passive immunization intervention against infections of emerging pathogens, including SARS-CoV-2, and safely used as a nasal, oral spray and gargle. In addition, IgY does not interact with mammalian Fc receptors or activate the mammalian complement system, so it can avoid triggering antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of disease and complement-mediated adverse inflammatory responses (Kovacs-Nolan and Mine 2012), therefore, it could be beneficial to administer neutralizing IgY (or, after genetic modification) intravascularly to treat SARS-CoV-2 infection (Lee et al. 2010; Lu et al. 2020) . In this study, the chicken polyclonal IgY prepared can significantly inhibit the entry of SARS-CoV-2 virus into cells in vitro (Data not shown, Chinese Patent No. CN113402603A). The global effort to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infections will have to continue for some period, IgY antibodies from hen egg yolk could be a good alternative because of their viability for large-scale commercial production and the relative non-invasive methods used to prepare them.",
