Currently, many challenges influence the development of the PHW worldwide, including population aging, the burden of non-communicable diseases (NCDs), health inequalities in a globalized world, migration and its related consequences for the health sector and social welfare systems [2] [3] [4] . All these challenges are imposed on the design of rational and evidence-based strategies for planning and developing a PHW capable of dealing effectively with public health (PH) problems. A PHW, depending on the specific country context, exhibits different qualifications, job profiles, availability and requirements for career paths and, importantly, remuneration schemes. There is a growing consensus that even between neighboring countries, the impact on labor market participation and recruitment in the PH sector is not comparable [5, 6] . The situation is much more complex in those countries of the World Health Organization (WHO) European Region characterized by civil unrest and armed conflicts, including Ukraine.",

Next to the current health care reforms, there is also an ongoing process of PH legislation development in the country [10] . The available PH program descriptions are often challenging to interpret, and clear links between the specific objectives and expected (long-or short-term) goals are not always straightforward [11] . One of the main objectives of new reforms is shifting from treatment policy to strengthening and maintaining health and preventing diseases. Building such a PH system will be one of the requirements of the Association Agreement between Ukraine and the European Union. The goal will be to create a system where every head of the central authorities and local executive authorities will consider the consequences of their decisions on PH conditions [12] .",

It is also a practical approach when various interests are involved in complex and multi-faceted systems. Policy analysis is considered a generic name, and it is gaining increasing prominence, although it is not considered a unified field of study yet [16, 20] . Conventionally, policy analysis denotes a wide array of methods and instruments employed to evaluate the characteristics and features of established policies [16] . Many approaches available to date display the attempts to carry out the policy analysis. However, the practical aspects of policy analysis in PH in developing countries or countries facing major policy reforms are still lacking [21] . Therefore, policy analysis may constitute a valuable tool in PH to investigate highly contextualized issues and challenges [22] . The main concern of policy analysis relates to the outcomes of health policies, including the effects and impact on the population [16] . Deborah Stone [23] described policy analysis as a process that always contains a political aspect. There seems to be a gap between the various policy actors' specific interests in the process of policymaking as such and policy implementation. Sometimes, new policies stay within the formal requirements simply because of the apprehensive attitudes of some influential policymakers [24] . Due to its intersectorality and often unclear position within the health and social care system, the PHW is seemingly a topic which yields itself to policy analysis.",

Once the policy options are identified, practical steps toward its implementation can be taken. The practicality and effectiveness of any policy or policy steps can be evaluated by applying the questions clarifying implementation needs and possibilities. For example, Fretheim et al. [17] defined four entry questions for a policy to be implemented: \"What are the potential barriers to the successful implementation of a new policy?\"; \"What strategies should be considered in planning the implementation of a new policy to facilitate the necessary behavioral changes among healthcare recipients and citizens?\"; \"What strategies should be considered in planning the implementation of a new policy to facilitate the necessary behavioural changes in healthcare professionals?\" and \"What strategies should be considered in planning the implementation of a new policy to facilitate the necessary organisational changes?\" [17] .",

Due to the complexity of the information and the diversity of the concepts, authors examined the scientific and gray literature. The combined search strategy resulted in the identification of the common nine measures. The complete set included (1) alignment between the 10 Essential Public Health Operations (EPHOs); (2) regulations and norms; (3) capacity assessment; (4) datasets and databases; (5) workforce development strategies, planning and management; (6) education, training, core competencies and models; (7) licensing, accreditation and credentialing; (8) forecasting strategies for enumerating and quotas and (9) ethical and professional codes of conduct.

It stresses the importance of PH throughout the country by leadership and effective oversight of operations performance. However, the framework cannot thoroughly do \"justice\" to the complexity of the diverse processes, actors and institutional conditions that affect PHW development. Instead, it should be considered a \"guiding light\" to operationalize a possible assessment, leading to quality improvement of the PHW. As such, policy analysis was not performed; instead, the analysis attempted to show \"what and how\" could be done and the means of overcoming the barriers based on the solutions proposed by policy analysis tools.

First, a typical problem involved with this type of process is that decision makers often ignore various types of policy analysis [16, 32] . Furthermore, decisions are usually made in a group setting rather than by individuals [29, 33] . Additionally, a policy analysis report is only one source of information that decision makers rely upon, whereas many other competing values influence decision makers in their pressing work [34] . More importantly, different stakeholders are involved with various types of policy analysis. In our analysis, we examined several policy analysis approaches without conducting policy analysis ourselves. We suggest undertaking a policy analysis to further develop a PHW strategy in Ukraine. Therefore, decision makers and politicians in Ukraine may be confronted with competing studies based on similar or other data and presenting them with contrasting assumptions, alternatives, criteria and conclusions [33, 35, 36] .",

It seems that there is no explicit protocol and communication strategy concerning who, what and how. As a result, there is insufficient understanding of the needs and expectations of various actors and stakeholders. (5) The health communication and knowledge translation to society, including essential health messages (e.g., immunization), seemed ineffective or insufficient. (6) Identified problems were also related to data collection modalities, data linking, interpretation and presentation.
