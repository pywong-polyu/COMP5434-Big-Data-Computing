Fast and accurate African swine fever virus (ASFV) antigen detection is very important for ASF prevention. This study aims to establish a new detection method for detection ASFV antigen using time-resolved fluorescence immunoassay (TRFIA) in the nose and mouth discharge. A double antibody sandwich TRFIA method was optimized and established. Recombinant P30 recombinant antigen was captured by its antibodies immobilized on 96-well plate, and then banded together with another detection antibodies labeled with Europium(III) (Eu 3+ ) chelates, finally timeresolved analyzer measured the fluorescence intensity. The performance of this TRFIA (sensitivity, specificity and accuracy) was evaluated using the clinical samples and compared with the nucleic acid testing method. The sensitivity of this TRFIA was 0.015 ng/ mL (dynamic range 0.24-500 ng/mL) with high specificity. The recovery ranged from 92.00 to 103.62 %, the inter-assay CVs ranged from 5.50 to 11.96 %, and the intra-assay CVs was between 5.20 and 10.53 %. Additionally, the cutoff value was 0.016. TRFIA took only 45 min to generate results, and its detection capability comparable to the nucleic acid detection. This study developed a TRFIA method that could be used for qualitative/quantitative detection of ASFV antigen in pigs nasal discharge, which has high sensitivity, specificity and accuracy. This TRFIA provides a new method for rapidly screening ASFV infection in pigs industry.",

ASF has caused major economic losses, limited pig industry and even threatened food security in affected countries. ASF has erupted and spread in Poland, Lithuania, China, Latvia, Belarus, USA and the Russian Federation etc. [3, 4] . Unfortunately, there is currently no effective antiviral drug or vaccine against ASFV [5] . Stamping out and movement control are the mainly control measures. Currently, the diagnostic methods for ASFV include nucleic acid detection, ASFV antigen detection and ASFV antibody detection (ELISA method), and establishment of new ASFV diagnostic technology is urgently needed [6, 7] .",

But most of them are qualitative and with narrow detection ranges. Although the PCR method is the gold standard for various types of virus detection, only a few PCR-based ASF diagnostic assays have been previously described for detection and identification of ASFV [17, 18] . This may be because the PCR method requires relatively high technical personnel and equipment. At present, various new methods have been established and applied in ASF screening. LAMP is an alternative to traditional PCR, which requires a shorter reaction time, higher specificity and has a lower cost [19] . James et al. developed a loopmediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay, and it is a simple-to-use and inexpensive molecular assay format for ASF diagnosis. There was good concordance between the LAMP assay and real-time PCR in clinical samples [20] .",

Compared with ELISA, TRFIA has higher sensitivity and wider measurement range. Schr\u00f6der and Kuhlmann found that the use of a TRFIA significantly improved the quantitative detection of tetanus antitoxin over that of the ELISA technique, and the wide measurement range of TRFIA enabled fast examination of large numbers of serum samples without the need for repetition [23] . In this study, a novel TRFIA methodology was developed for the quantitative determination of ASFV antigen in pigs nasal discharge. The comparison experiment found its detection performance is equivalent with LAMP-based kits (Chinese Academy of Inspection and Quarantine, Beijing, China, No. 11 new veterinary drugs). The result shows that TRFIA is a promising detection method, which has better performance than ELISA and real-time PCR.",

The assay was based on an double-antibody sandwich immunoassay format, and performed in 96-well plates. The sensitivity of this TRFIA is 0.015 ng/mL (dynamic range 0.24-500 ng/mL). There is very low cross-reaction with 5 interferents. The recovery ranged from 92.00 to 103.62 %, the inter-assay CVs ranged from 5.50 to 11.96 %, and the intra-assay CVs was between 5.20 and 10.53 %, which means this TRFIA has high accuracy. Additionally, we calculated the cutoff values using 110 nasal discharge samples of the healthy pigs. When antigen concentration \u2265 0.016 ng/mL, the sample (pig) may be ASFV positive. Compared with the nucleic acid method, \u03c72 test showed the detection performance of TRFIA is equivalent. Importantly, the main advantage of this TRFIA is in quantitative detection (not just qualitative detection). The cutoff values provide the basis for qualitative screening, and the drawn standard curve realizes quantitative detection for ASFV.",
