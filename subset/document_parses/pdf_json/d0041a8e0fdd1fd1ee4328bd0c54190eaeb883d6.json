            "text": "Face masks have been widely employed as a personal protective measure during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, concerns remain that masks create a false sense of security that reduces adherence to other public health measures, including social distancing. This paper tested whether mask-wearing was negatively associated with social distancing compliance. In two studies, we combined video-observational records of public mask-wearing in two Dutch cities with a naturalexperimental approach to evaluate the effect of an area-based mask mandate. We found no observational evidence of an association between mask-wearing and social distancing but found a positive link between crowding and social distancing violations. Our natural-experimental analysis showed that an area-based mask mandate did not significantly affect social distancing or crowding levels. Our results alleviate the concern that mask use reduces social distancing compliance or increases crowding levels. On the other hand, crowding reduction may be a viable strategy to mitigate social distancing violations.",

Only one field experimental study found conditional support of risk compensation, e.g., with men keeping less distance to masked confederates 18 . Comparatively, studies relying on other methods tend to offer more mixed evidence 19, 20 . For example, one survey study found that mask-wearing was linked with greater concern about avoidance of others in public places 21 , while a quasi-experimental survey study found fragile evidence that mask use may occasionally elicit risk compensation by reducing the engagement in physical distancing 20 . Further, difference-in-differences studies relying on geo-tracked mobility data found that compulsory mask policies did not affect community mobility 22 and, conversely, that such mandates lead to less stay-at-home compliance 4 . Overall, the literature offers a somewhat mixed picture of the link between mask use and social distancing, although it is also noteworthy that field-experimental evidence relying on direct records of real-life mask use and social distancing behavior tend to agree in rejecting the hypothesis. Following this lead, the current study applies an alternative method to provide high-resolution data on real-life public behavior: video-assisted naturalistic observation 23 . Specifically, across two studies-one observational and one that includes a natural experiment in two major Dutch cities-we used video footage to examine mask use and distancing behavior in public outdoor settings during the COVID-19 pandemic. We tested the individual-level expectation of the risk compensation theory that mask-wearers keep less distance, as well as the parallel expectation at the aggregated level that an areabased mask mandate would make public places more crowded. We note that the study is exploratory in nature (in that an analysis plan was not pre-registered), but we stress that we strived to minimize the number of researcher degrees of freedom in the analysis and were committed to reporting our results irrespective of null findings 24 .",

Given that manual video coding is very laborintensive, we selected 60 h of recording from this wider sample 25 , which conformed to the following inclusion criteria: The clips were recorded by a single camera to minimize between-context heterogeneity. This camera should have a high recording quality (e.g., brightness, resolution), allow for continuous observation of pedestrians from a long distance, and be located in an outdoor pedestrianized street typical for Amsterdam (no side roads, traffic lights, crossings, and pedestrians only, see osf.io/j7guw for street drawings). Further, data should be recorded during the first wave of the pandemic (i.e., May 21, 24, 28, 30, and June 4, 2020) , the day hours (to ensure the recording brightness), and cover both week-and weekend days (i.e., three Thursdays, one Saturday, one Sunday) and their varying behavioral routines 26 .",

This step was motivated by increasing infection numbers in both cities 43 .",

Because the municipalities wanted an experimental evaluation, they did not implement the mandate in all eligible areas. Therefore, we selected control areas from a wider list of areas considered for treatment but eventually remained untreated. In sum, we selected three treatment areas and three comparable control areas, which had the best-quality public security cameras installed. Practically, the mask mandate was announced by onsite signs, municipal workers informing visitors and handing out masks during the first weeks, and police reprimanding or fining non-compliers for 1 day during the third week. Further, the mandate was heavily debated on national media. www.nature.com/scientificreports/ We collected around 500 h of recordings, recorded from the end of July throughout August 2020. The raw footage covered 13 days (Wednesdays, Saturdays, one Sunday), with four days of pre-intervention baseline measures (July 22, 25, 29, and August 1), and nine post-intervention days (August 5, 8, 12, 15, 19, 22, 23, 26, 29) . From this sample, we randomly selected 78 30-min segments, across which a team of twelve trained research assistants observed 423 persons (167 with and 256 without a mask) entering and leaving the scene, with an average person observation time of 23 s (SD = 17.8). Finally, at randomly selected time points across the treatment and control areas, we further took 358 records of crowding and 342 records of the proportion of people wearing a mask. Additionally, we conducted onsite observations in treatment areas to document how the mandate was implemented in practice (e.g., were the onsite signs announcing the mask mandate clearly visible) 44 .",

This decision was informed by the experience of training the coder team, with excises of independent double coding suggesting that the codebook was transferable to the new study context. However, it should be mentioned that the study contexts were not identical. Not all areas in Study 2 had street tiles-used as a \"ruler\" to assess social distancing in Study 1-and in these areas, the coders thus relied on alternative reference objects measured onsite. Finally, we note that the 1.5-m distancing measure has since been interrater reliability tested twice, both in areas without and with different types of tiles layers; in both evaluations, we reached excellent scores replicating those found in Study 1 (i.e., AC 1 = 0.97, AC 1 = 0.98 45 ). Figure 1 shows that the key regression results of Study 2 were similar to Study 1: Mask use was again not associated with social distancing (\u03b2 = 0.03, CI 95% [\u2212 0.05, 0.10], p = 0.511), with a Bayes factor offering strong evidence for the absence of this association (BF 01 = 17.0). Also, people crowding was positively associated with social distancing violations (\u03b2 = 0.18, CI 95% [0.10, 0.26], p < 0.001). These results remained unchanged after controlling for whether the persons were in an area where mask-wearing was voluntary or mandatory. To minimize the risk that Study 1 and Study 2 were underpowered to identify a potential minute effect of masks on distancing when estimated separately, we analyzed a dataset pooled from the two studies 46 . This analysis confirmed the non-significant result of masks (\u03b2 = 0.01, CI 95% [\u2212 0.04, 0.07], p = 0.584, BF 01 = 25.5).",

A manipulation check found that the area-based mask mandate increased the proportion of mask-wearing by more than 30 percentage points (second difference = 0.32, p < 0.001), suggesting a relatively successful implementation of the treatment. The predicted probability of mask-wearers in the pre-intervention treatment condition was 3% and 39% in the post-intervention condition. The non-complete adherence to the mandate corresponded with our field observations conducted in the treatment areas, suggesting some uncertainty about where it was obliged to wear a mask (e.g., the signs announcing that you entered a mandatory mask zone could be overlooked; plausibly, this may have impacted one of the included cameras, which was placed at the fringe of a zone).",

The current observational and experimental studies-examining both voluntary and mandatory mask settings-also rejected this hypothesis. As such, our findings add valuable information to the literature suggesting that face mask-wearing is not likely to lead to a reduction in social distancing compliance or an increase in crowding levels due to a false sense of security. With accumulating evidence that mask-wearing is efficient in reducing the spread of coronavirus 51 , the current results add to the view that this beneficial mask effect is unlikely to be \"canceled out\" by an adverse risk compensation effect of masks-wearing in public settings.",

This result indicates that the literature has been overly focused on individual-level predictors of social distancing violations (e.g., risk compensation, age, norms) at the expense of analyzing the \"situational opportunity\" for violations afforded by people crowding 26 . A practical implication of this argument is that COVID-19 interventions towards social distancing violations may find utility in crowd control 52 and in targeting infrastructural surroundings that shape public crowding 53 . In doing so, however, it should be kept in mind that the risk of coronavirus transmission is lower in outdoor than indoor settings 54 . As such, crowd control interventions may be most relevant for enclosed semi-public places (e.g., train stations, shopping malls) where some prior research also finds that crowding decreases interpersonal distance 55 .",

Another limitation is the between-subject design-especially in the non-experimental Study 1-which cannot separate the effect of mask-wearing from the potential selection-effect that mask-wearers are more (or less) conscientious persons and willing to distance. For example, the willingness to distance varies for some persons across the pandemic 56 , as plausibly indicated by the circumstance that the compliance level was higher during the first wave (Study 1) than during the second wave (Study 2).",
