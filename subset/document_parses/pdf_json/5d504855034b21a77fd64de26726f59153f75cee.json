Stromectol (ivermectin 3 mg) and its generics (Arrow Lab, Biogaran, Gerda, Mylan, Pierre Fabre, Sandoz, Zentiva) are mainly distributed in Europe and North America. In Europe, ivermectin is labeled for the treatment of strongyloidiasis, diagnosed or suspected infection with Wuchereria bancrofti (the filarial nematode causing lymphatic filariasis) or O. volvulus (the filarial nematode causing onchocerciasis), and human sarcoptic scabies. In North America, ivermectin is labeled for the treatment of strongyloidiasis and onchocerciasis. Ivermectin is also used off-label in certain cases of acarodermatitis (skin inflammation due to bites of parasitic mites), rosacea and loiasis (the disease caused by the filarial nematode Loa loa) [1, 2] . In African countries, ivermectin is distributed at single oral doses of 150-200 \u03bcg/kg as part of onchocerciasis and lymphatic filariasis elimination programs (the drug, registered under the name of Mectizan for these indications, is donated by Merck & Co., Inc.). It is used as preventive chemotherapy, i.e. distributed annually (sometimes biannually) using a mass drug administration strategy, i.e. to the entire eligible population of the target communities without individual diagnosis.",

            "text": "Ivermectin is a derivative of avermectins. It acts mainly by binding to the glutamate-dependent chloride channels of invertebrate nerve and muscle cells, causing an increase in membrane permeability leading ultimately to neuromuscular paralysis and death of certain parasites. In subjects with high densities of microfilariae (mf, the larval stages of the filarial parasites) in the skin or the blood, ivermectin is able to induce complex inflammatory reactions called Mazzotti reactions which include pruritus, rash, fever, malaise, lymphadenopathy, arthralgia, tachycardia, hypotension, edema and abdominal pain [3, 4] . These reactions reflect the inflammatory phenomena associated with the destruction of mf by the drug. Since the early 1990, ivermectin has been known to cause potentially fatal encephalopathies in individuals with very high microfilarial density of L. loa in the blood (loiasis is endemic only in Central Africa) [5, 6] , also referred to as \"Possible/Probable L. loa encephalopathy temporally related to Mectizan\" (PLERM). PLERM can occur in subjects with L. loa microfilarial density >10,000 mf/mL if measured before treatment or >1,000 mf/mL if measured after treatment [7] . Since then, few studies have been conducted to investigate the frequency of these Loa-related adverse drug reactions (ADR) and the mechanisms by which they occur [8] .",

The search identified 52 ivermectin-related ICSRs entered into VigiBase by the pharmacovigilance system of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) between 2009 and 2013. All patients had central and peripheral nervous system disorders. The mean L. loa microfilarial density measured after treatment in these patients was 2149.1 mf/mL, and 61% of them had microfilarial density below 1000 mf/mL, suggesting the possible occurrence of PLERM at low microfilarial density. Another search of the VigiBase was conducted in 2016 to identify serious neurological adverse events other than PLERM after ivermectin administration. The authors found 28 cases of suspected neurological serious ADRs (sADRs) following ivermectin treatment for diseases other than onchocerciasis (10 for scabies, 8 for acarodermatitis, 3 for strongyloidiasis, 5 for lymphatic filariasis, 1 for myiasis and 1 for taeniasis) [10] . This study raised questions about the mechanisms underlying the appearance of these neurological effects. To our knowledge, these studies are the only two that have used a pharmacovigilance database to evaluate the occurrence of post-ivermectin ADRs and they have focused exclusively on neurological events.",

An ICSR is an anonymized report for a single individual who experienced adverse event(s) that may be linked to the use of one or more drugs. ICSR contains sociodemographic information (age, sex, reporter qualification, country of origin, year of report), information about the drug administration (frequency, dosage, comedication) and information about the reported adverse event. The latter include the seriousness according to the criteria of the International Council for Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH) [27] , adverse event verbatim description and associated terms from the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (Med-DRA) developed by the ICH. All reports of suspected sADRs associated with antinematodal drugs (Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical [ATC] code P02C) from December 2003 (first ever report of ivermectin-associated suspected sADR recorded) up to July 15, 2020 were extracted.

In contrast, benzimidazoles have little short-term effect on the mf of any filarial species, and thus do not induce Mazzotti reactions, but impair the production of new mf by the adult female worms. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved product information for ivermectin mentions that \"Rarely, patients with onchocerciasis who are also heavily infected with Loa loa may develop a serious or even fatal encephalopathy either spontaneously or following treatment with an effective microfilaricide.\" [2] In our study, we confirmed the findings of a previous analysis of the data in VigiBase [10] which identified encephalopathies reported with ivermectin also outside of SSA where L. loa is not endemic. In addition, we quantified this association by estimating aRORs for ivermectin-induced encephalopathy. aROR was higher in the SSA countries than in the RoW but both were significant, demonstrating a strong global safety signal. Another recent publication described the case of a 13 years old boy presenting a progressive encephalopathy after a single oral dose of ivermectin given at 230 \u03bcg per kg, i.e. only slightly higher than the dose used for ivermectin mass drug administration for onchocerciasis (150 \u03bcg/kg) and lymphatic filariasis (200 \u03bcg/kg) control or to prevent scabies infection (200 \u03bcg/kg). The authors found that the patient was a carrier of non-sense mutations in the gene coding for the ATP-binding cassette subfamily B member 1 (ABCB1) transporter which is known to efflux ivermectin from the brain. These mutations can lead to neurological adverse reactions induced by ivermectin [32] . Our results are therefore consistent with the literature and support the evidence of post-ivermectin serious neurological ADRs in some people not infected with L. loa. The clinical presentations of Loa-related and non-Loa-related post-ivermectin neurological ADRs are summarized in Table 7 .",

By identifying a strong disproportionality signal between ivermectin and benzimidazole drugs or all other antinematodal drugs, our study suggests that ivermectin may be associated with a higher risk of toxidermias than other antinematodal drugs. We also found in VigiBase two types of toxidermia that were never mentioned in the literature: 9 cases of DRESS and 2 cases of acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis after ivermectin intake. These findings could be of great interest for clinicians considering ivermectin treatment in patients at risk for these sADRs or assessing the causality of ivermectin in the development of a toxidermia.",

Second, analyses were performed with adjustment for several potential confounders such as origin, gender, age and period of notification. Third, nearly all results of our principal analysis were confirmed in our sensitivity analyses considering all antinematodal agents.

            "text": "Limitations of this study include the concern about under-reporting of suspected ADRs and differences in the under-reporting between different countries as well as the lack of information on the number of drug administrations, which is a major disadvantage inherent in studies using pharmacovigilance databases [33, 34] . Although under-reporting may be less important since we focused on serious ADRs (which are more likely to be reported) [35] , our analyses cannot measure the real risk of ADR but only the differences in reported events. Indeed, subjects in the control group (non-cases) are not healthy controls but patients with other various reported ADRs and pharmacovigilance data do not consider the total amount of patients exposed to the drug. Nevertheless, there is no apparent reason that, in a specific region, ADRs would be more or less reported with ivermectin than those occurring after treatment with benzimidazole drugs or other antinematodal drugs. By analyzing real-life surveillance data, disproportionality analyses have demonstrated their usefulness for detecting drug risks [36, 37] . Anyway, these results should be taken with caution because of potential missing information. Pharmacovigilance systems are not yet well established in SSA countries. In 2017, only 30% of these countries had specific procedures for the monitoring of ADRs and only 28% had a platform for coordinating pharmacovigilance activities at the national level [38] . Cases of serious adverse events occurring during the ivermectin mass drug administration organized by the onchocerciasis and LF control programs have to be reported by the countries to the Mectizan Donation Program, but the extent to which all relevant observations are recorded in the rural areas where onchocerciasis and LF are endemic and then passed on to the central level is unknown as is the extent to which they are reported into the WHO VigiBase. For example, we found no cases from Cameroon even though ivermectin mass drug administration programs have been ongoing there for 30 years, and many cases are known to have occurred since the early 1990s [39] . In addition, the first case of a post-ivermectin ADR was reported in Vigi-Base in December 2003 while the first reported death after ivermectin was reported by the WHO Drug Information in 1991 [40] . We consider it likely that availability of complete data from SSA would show more cases associated with ivermectin use and would increase the strength of the safety signals we identified. In addition, a notoriety bias (selection bias in which a case has a greater chance of being reported if the drug is known to cause, thought to cause, or likely to cause the event of interest [41] ) could be considered for reports of encephalopathy in SSA given that the first cases of encephalopathies involving ivermectin led to complications in the early mass drug administration campaigns for elimination of onchocerciasis. However it is unlikely that such bias exist for two reasons (i) in SSA countries, ivermectin is distributed as part of mass treatment organized by the Ministries of Health, and those of L. loa-endemic countries might be less inclined to report post-ivermectin sADRs because the cases are not regarded as exceptional and (ii) we also found a strong disproportionality signal in the RoW which is not being affected by this bias. Our analyses identified serious ADRs that can be associated with ivermectin use that to date have received little, if any attention. As ivermectin is currently widely used off label, especially in Latin America, to control COVID-19 without strong evidence for beneficial effect [42] , this study is timely to describe the various suspected sADRs to which this population is potentially exposed even in the absence of onchocerciasis and loiasis endemicity. While ivermectin's excellent safety profile is the basis for mass drug administration campaigns and progress towards elimination in particular of onchocerciasis, one must remain aware and vigilant about the sADRs it may possibly induce.",
