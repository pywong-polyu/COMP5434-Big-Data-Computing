We report the clinical data, together with a detailed genotype description, immunological analyses, and related expression of the ATM protein. We show that the presence of some residual ATM kinase activity leads to the clinical phenotype variant A-T that differs from the classical A-T. Our data illustrate that the diagnosis of the variant form of A-T can be delayed and difficult, while early recognition of the variant form as well as the classical A-T is a prerequisite for providing a correct prognosis and appropriate rehabilitation and support, including the avoidance of diagnostic X-ray procedures, given the increased risk of malignancies and the higher risk for side effects of subsequent cancer treatment.",

It belongs to the group of genome instability syndromes that, like A-T, show an unusual sensitivity to ionising radiation and a cancer susceptibility. Its onset is often seen in infancy with cerebellar ataxia being the principal feature (1) . Ocular telangiectasias develop later but are usually apparent by age 10 years. Due to the progressive course of the disorder, a wheelchair is usually required for mobility by early teen age (2) . Clinical suspicion can be confirmed by measuring the serum alpha-foetoprotein (AFP), which is an easily detectable and reliable biological hallmark of the disorder.",

Indeed, the abovementioned cardinal clinical features might be only partially present depending primarily on the particular type of identified ATM mutations and the amount of residual ATM kinase activity. The current expansion of the original phenotype is also closely linked with the ongoing discoveries of the multiple and versatile roles of the ATM protein that go beyond its critical role in maintaining the genomic integrity (3, 4) . Indeed, ATM is also important in cell homeostasis, synaptic trafficking and early neurodevelopment by promoting neurogenesis and migration. The neurodegenerative features in adult neurons reflect the DNA damage during oxidative stress, which progresses with age (3) (4) (5) .",

Therefore, the name A-T can be misleading as both ataxia and telangiectasia can be absent in some patients retaining a low level of ATM kinase activity. In those patients, designated AT variants, the neurological presentation does not necessarily include cerebellar features at the forefront and might be essentially extrapyramidal (i.e., dystonia, choreoathetosis, resting tremor, parkinsonism and myoclonus) or mixed, with little to no systemic features and no immunological impairment (6, (9) (10) (11) .",

Despite these distinctive features, the risk of malignancy is significantly increased in both types of A-T, with common haematological involvement in the first two decades of life and increased risk of solid organ malignancies during young adulthood (13, 14) , making crucial an early recognition that will enable proper management and follow-up (14, 15) .",

He was first seen at our developmental clinic at 19 months of age, because his motor milestones were delayed while his cognitive function was preserved. He sat at 6 months and started standing and shuffling at 7-8 months. Despite his initial progress, he did not achieve independent walking before 18 months and started falling a month later. He also demonstrated difficulty in drinking and had started to drool. The parents also noticed bizarre posturing of the arms and hands. He was referred to the neurology outpatient clinic at 20 months. Brain MRI was unremarkable, and a primary dystonia was first suspected. A few months later, mild hand tremor along with an ataxic gait led however to a broader workup. The finding of extremely low serum IgG in association with elevated AFP (89.7 mcg/l) raised the suspicion of A-T. This was confirmed by genetic analysis revealing compound heterozygosity for likely pathogenic and pathogenic variants in the ATM gene (NM_000051.3), c.2455T>C;(p.Cys819Arg), and c.8264_8268del;(p.Tyr2755CysfsTer12), respectively. Each parent is heterozygous for one of the variants identified. A lymphoblastoid cell line showed no detectable ATM protein and therefore no kinase activity ( Figure 1, lane 6) . The immunologic workup revealed a severe immunodeficiency resulting in an almost complete absence of IgG and IgA and decreased T and B cells, but normal T cell lymphocyte function with anti-CD3 and tetanus toxoid. There was no history of recurrent and frequent infections. At the age of 2 years, he started on monthly intravenous immunoglobulin substitution at 2 years old and later switched to subcutaneous immunoglobulins. He was initially treated with prophylaxis cotrimoxazole, which was later discontinued because of profound neutropenia. Every winter, he could not attend the day care program because of recurrent upper respiratory viral infections, with difficulty to regain weight. So far, he has not suffered any severe infection. At present, he walks independently for short distance, despite persisting ataxia and dystonic posturing. His disease is globally stable, and he continues to attend mainstream school with additional care. Concerning the nutritional aspect, he was put on enteral nocturnal feeding at 4 years because of failure to thrive due to poor appetite and caloric intake. He also suffers from chronic constipation requiring daily laxatives. SARA and ICARS were not performed at diagnosis due to an age limit. During the last follow-up visit, both scores were 14 and 41, respectively. Patient 2 ( Table 1 ) is a 29-year-old male born to nonconsanguineous Kurdish parents. He was known with a long history of non-progressive movement disorders since early childhood in the setting of preserved intellectual abilities. During adolescence, the combination of mild dystonia and axial myoclonus of the upper trunk led first to consideration of the diagnosis of myoclonus dystonia syndrome, which could not be genetically explored at that time. During a visit at the adult movement disorders clinic at the age of 22 years, a new onset of mild resting and intentional tremor in association with mild parkinsonian features prompted to repeat a brain MRI as well as a DaTscan in order to detect any abnormalities within the nigrostriatal pathways. Structural brain imaging revealed a global cerebellar atrophy that, in retrospect, was present to a much lesser degree 10 years earlier and had been overlooked. The DaTscan was fully normal. In addition, a chronic axonal s e n s o r i m o t o r n e u r o p a t h y w a s d e m o n s t r a t e d o n electrophysiological studies in spite of minimal peripheral nervous system manifestations. Exome sequencing with targeted bioinformatics analysis on a panel of 1,400 genes implicated in various neurological disorders showed a compound heterozygosity for two likely pathogenic variants in the ATM gene (NM_000051.3), c.6047A>G;(p.Asp2016Gly) and c.6385T>G;(p.Tyr2129Asp). Each parent is heterozygous for one of the variants identified. The AFP level was at 78 mcg/l. Functional studies of the ATM kinase protein showed a low level of ATM which also retained a reduced level of ATM kinase activity/signalling (Figure 1, lane 12) . The immunological workup revealed low IgG/IgA/IgM, despite normal vaccine antibody, lymphocyte subpopulation, and function. His infectious history was unremarkable. He developed a Type I diabetes at 27 years of age. At the last visit, in August 2020, he had dysarthria, mild axial dystonia, some choreic movements, resting tremor of the right upper limb and minimal ataxia only apparent at tandem gait. He is still walking normally. He is now undertaking postgraduate studies in a foreign country. A variant form of A-T was retained as the likely diagnosis. SARA and ICARS at the time of diagnosis were 3 and 4 respectively, while they were 10 and 11 respectively at the last follow-up visit.",

On clinical examination, he exhibited intermittent dystonic postures of the extremities, gait ataxia and mild dysarthria. Cognitive development was normal. No ocular telangiectasia and oculomotor apraxia were noted. An elevated AFP serum level (134 mcg/l) was identified. The clinical suspicion of A-T was confirmed by genetic analysis revealing a compound heterozygosity for two pathogenic and likely loss-of-function variants in the ATM gene (NM_000051.3), c.790delT; (p.Tyr264IlefsTer12) and c.103C>T;(p.Arg35Ter). Each parent is heterozygous for one of the variants identified. Functional studies of the ATM kinase protein showed absence of detectable ATM protein and also no activity/signalling (Figure 1, lane 10) . The immunological workup showed decreased B and T cell subset counts but normal mitogen-stimulated lymphocyte proliferation as well as immunoglobulin serum levels. His history of infections was unremarkable. Currently, he suffers from drooling, and his walking is difficult because of increasing ataxia and involuntary movements.

The six patients described here illustrate the phenotypic variability of A-T that can present in childhood with prominent extrapyramidal features, with or without cerebellar ataxia. Pure extrapyramidal symptoms, which are uncommon in the course of classical A-T, suggest possible differences in neuronal vulnerability and pathway involvement between the classical and variant forms of the disease (8) .

This was likely to have been derived from the c.6385T>G; (p.Tyr2129Asp) mutant protein in patient 2 as the second mutant protein c.6047A>G p.(Asp2016Gly) has been observed in another A-T patient who do not have any ATM activity/ signalling (not shown). In patients 4 and 5, it is the mutant protein c.6154G>A;(p.Glu2052Lys) that provides the activity/ signalling. While there is a clear increased phosphorylation of three targets (Smc1 ser966, KAP-1 ser824 and Nbn ser343, the increase is less obvious in this instance for CREBser121, hence the reason for using several targets. These are both mutations that can plausibly be associated with some expression of ATM and some retained kinase activity/signalling. These cases were diagnosed in young adulthood as their phenotype was much milder than the others. Moreover, they show a much more indolent course with minimal progression over two decades (18) . These cases fit the clinical-biological picture of variant A-T and highlight the possibility that the more residual ATM kinase activity is present, the milder the neurological features may be, often with prominent extrapyramidal features and longer preserved ambulation (7, 8) . The presence of residual ATM kinase activity is also associated with mild axonal polyneuropathy, late-onset anterior horn cell degeneration and adult-onset oculomotor apraxia that can mimic other neurological disorders (11, 14) . In addition, patients with the A-T variant might not exhibit oculomotor and bulbar signs (11) . ATM pathogenic variants, mainly truncating or severe missense mutations, found in patients 1 (missense p.Cys819Arg), 3 and 6 respectively resulted in complete absence of ATM protein and thus no kinase activity. The history of infections of these patients was unremarkable although some had immunological impairment, such as lymphopenia, hypogammaglobulinemia and in one of them even the absence of B cells and very low T cells ( Table 1) . These three patients were all diagnosed in early childhood because of movement disorders with marked ataxia, variable extrapyramidal features and rapid deterioration of neurological impairment. Although the cerebellar and neurological degeneration progresses in classical A-T, it has been suggested that immune deficiency remains relatively stable over time (19) . ATM is crucial for lymphocyte development that relies on doublestrand break repair, such as V(D)J and class-switch recombination of immunoglobulin genes.",

            "text": "In approximately 70% of classical A-T patients, ATM deficiency results in PID with highly variable features. Defective cell-mediated immunity (T-cell lymphopenia with reduced function of CD4+) is found in almost all patients, whereas deficiency in humoral immunity is more variable (decreased or absent of serum IgA, IgE, IgG2 and IgG4 levels, deficiency of specific antibody responses and gammopathy). The most frequent defect in the immunoglobulin profile is related to IgA and IgG2 deficiencies, which are diminished in 50% and 80% of cases, respectively (9) . An estimated 10% of A-T patients have decreased IgA and IgG levels with normal to increased IgM levels, which is referred to as \"hyper IgM phenotype\" (3, 15, 19) . In our cohort, we observed a mild to severe hypogammaglobulinemia, often low B and T cells but normal lymphocyte function. In line with the literature, we also noted a discrepancy between laboratory immunological abnormalities and the relative seldom increased vulnerability to systemic bacterial and severe viral or opportunistic infections, even before IVIG was started without antibiotic prophylaxis (20) . Nevertheless, mild sinopulmonary infections occur quite frequently and could be explained by the presence of swallowing difficulties, pharyngeal/thoracic muscle weakness and abnormal injury repair in a setting of immune dysregulation (3, 15, 19, 21) . Lung disease is present in more than 70% of A-T patients, and 50% of them die in adolescence from respiratory failure in a context of irreversible parenchymal damage (emphysema, bronchiectasis and interstitial lung disease/pulmonary fibrosis) (3). The majority of patients with a mild A-T variant present themselves with normal immunological capacity (15) . It was suggested that the residual ATM kinase activity mainly resulted in a less severe immunological phenotype than in patients without ATM kinase activity (8) . Our three patients each carried a missense mutation that resulted in expression of some mutant ATM with some retaining kinase activity. The presence of decreased immunoglobulins with normal T/B cells, in the older patient 2, could be explained by a lower residual ATM kinase activity than in the others with the mild A-T variant, in a setting of age-associated immune deterioration. The subclinical antibody deficiency in young patients with the A-T variant might become clinically apparent with progressive aging of the immune system due to the lack of ATM protection (19) . The titres of the vaccinespecific antibodies against tetanus, diphtheria, varicella, measles and pneumococcus were measured in 5 patients, except the one who had no B-cells (patient 1). All had high tetanus/diphtheria/ measles-specific antibody levels. Varicella-specific antibody levels were negative in the younger patient; we therefore recommended him the Varicella vaccine ( Table 1) . Differences between the specific antibody levels against pneumococci could be explained by the different exposures to different pneumococcal serotypes and the time of vaccination in relation to the blood tests. Pneumococcal 13-valent conjugate vaccine (PVC 13) is recommended in these patients to reinforce protection against possible invasive pneumococcal diseases. A-T patients are expected to respond well to vaccination with decreases in specific antibody levels over time. Some expert guidelines recommend vaccination of all A-T patients with PVC 13 followed by the 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine every 5 years (15, 21) . In A-T, the use of live vaccines is safe except for severely reduced T-cell numbers (CD4 < 500/mm 3 ; CD8 < 300/mm 3 ). Non-live vaccines are recommended in A-T as part of routine childhood vaccination programmes, except for patients receiving immunoglobulin replacement therapy. Annual vaccination with inactivated influenza vaccine and currently COVID-19 vaccines is recommended for all patients with A-T (15). Our mild and classical A-T patients, even those without B cells and very low T cells, tolerated well their MMR and varicella vaccine in infancy, showing a normal function of their cells.",

Assay showing the presence or absence of ATM in cells from each patient and whether this was associated with some activity/signalling ability. Cells were either irradiated (IR) with 2-Gy x-rays or not irradiated. The left-hand section show the results of the three classical patients, the middle section the results of variant patient 2, and the right-hand section the results of variants 4 and 5.Left-hand section, lanes 1 & 2-positive control. (A) Cells from a normal individual showing presence of ATM protein (B) and normal ATM activity/signalling showing phosphorylation of the targets SMC1 ser966 (C), KAP-1 ser 824 (E), Nbn ser343 (G), and CREB ser121 (I). There is a strong signal for each of these in lane 2 after activation. The total levels of SMC1, KAP-1, Nbn, and CREB are also shown in (D, F, H, J), respectively. Lanes 3 and 4-negative control. Cell lysate from a classical A-T patient with mutations ATM, c.1355delC; p.(Thr452AsnfsTer21) and c.3802delG; p.(Val1268Ter). Both are frameshift mutations leading to instability and loss of the ATM from both alleles. There is no differential phosphorylation of these targets in this patient's cells inane 4-consistent with the patient having A-T; there is no ATM (B). Lanes 5 and 6 show cell lysates from patient 6, lanes 7 and 8 lysates from patient 3, and lanes 9 and 10 lysates from patient 1. Just as with the negative control (lane 4), lysates from these three patients show absence of ATM protein (B) and absence of a differentially increased phosphorylation induced by irradiation, as indicated by absence of phosphorylation of SMC1 ser966, KAP-1 ser824, Nbn ser343, and CREB ser121 in lanes 6, 8, and 10, respectively. Middle section: lanes 11 and 12 show lysates from the same normal control as in lanes 1 and 2. Lanes 13 and 14 are cell lysates from the same classical A-T patient as in lanes 3 and 4. Lanes 15 and 16 are lysates from variant patient 2. (B) confirms that the lysate shows a low level of ATM protein. In contrast with the negative control (lane 14), this lysate shows a clear low level of ATM kinase activity/signalling as indicated by the presence of some moderate phosphorylation of SMC1 ser966, KAP-1 ser824, Nbn ser343, or CREB ser121 in lane 16. Right-hand section, lanes 17 and 18 and 19 and 20 are lysates from variant patients 4 and 5. The positive and negative controls have been removed but were the same as in lanes 1-4 and 11-14. (B) confirms that the variant lysates show a low level of ATM protein. In contrast to the negative controls in lanes 4 and 14, these lysates also show a clear low level of ATM that has some retained kinase activity/signalling as indicated by the presence of moderate phosphorylation of SMC1 ser966, KAP-1 ser824, and Nbn ser343 in particular.",
