At first glance, some symptoms may seem obvious in a lethal viral infection affecting the lungs, like breathlessness and respiratory secretions. However, other symptoms such as nausea, delirium, pain and anxiety are frequently seen near death in other conditions. It was not known how common those symptoms would be in hospitalised patients dying from COVID-19 or how well such symptoms could be alleviated. Little was known about the effect of our regular end-of-life care strategies, including drugs for symptom management in hospitals, for patients dying from COVID-19. However, emerging data show that the presentation of COVID-19 is diverse in both severity and symptoms.",

Furthermore, there were restrictions on family visitation up until the time when the patient was immediately dying. This made it more difficult to provide optimal end-of-life care [5, [12] [13] [14] . The restrictions on family visitation were aimed at minimising spread of the disease but were also related to a shortage of personal protective gear.",

A person might be in a palliative stage, for example, due to a metastatic cancer disease with limited survival prospects in the long run. Still, the same person might have realistic chances to recover from COVID-19, which makes decisions more complicated in the face of a new disease with partly unknown trajectory, at least in the individual case [29] . However, in this study, we only selected patients whose death, according to hospital staff, was expected and foreseeable. Therefore, symptom control and comfort should have been main priorities. a \"Don't know\" was an optional answer for the questions on symptom occurrence, and these responses were excluded from the analysis. Therefore, numbers do not sum to group totals Intravenous fluids administered during the last days of life may lead to complications such as pulmonary oedema and increased breathlessness [30] . Discontinuation of intravenous fluids such as artificial hydration and nutrition is generally recommended near end of life [1] . Slightly more patients dying from COVID-19 were prescribed parenteral administration of fluids and/or nasogastric feeding (37%) compared to patients dying in hospitals during 2019 (35%). This can possibly reflect prognostic uncertainty for COVID-19 and is perhaps also a product of the debate in Sweden during spring 2020 on whether elderly people with multiple diseases received appropriate care for COVID-19.",

The SRPC collects data about endof-life care with an established method and contains data about more than 60% of all yearly deaths in Sweden since 2012.

Therefore, numbers do not sum to group totals collection for this patient category early in the pandemic. During the study period, PCR tests to verify the COVID-19 diagnosis were limited. Therefore, some of the patients included in this study had only a clinical diagnosis. Furthermore, for patients with multiple diseases reported to the SRPC, we cannot determine whether COVID-19 was the underlying or a contributing cause of death. We have not been able to access Swedish official cause of death data, as these are added from the National Board of Health and Welfare to the SRPC with a delay of more than 12 months. However, we have used a definition similar to that of the Public Health Agency (Folkh\u00e4lsomyndigheten), which reports deaths for people with a reported COVID-19 diagnosis during the last 30 days as a death from COVID-19 [9] .",
