Without an existing effective medical therapy, vaccines are urgently needed to avoid the spread of this disease. In this study, we propose an in silico deep learning approach for prediction and design of a multi-epitope vaccine (DeepVacPred). By combining the in silico immunoinformatics and deep neural network strategies, the DeepVacPred computational framework directly predicts 26 potential vaccine subunits from the available SARS-CoV-2 spike protein sequence. We further use in silico methods to investigate the linear B-cell epitopes, Cytotoxic T Lymphocytes (CTL) epitopes, Helper T Lymphocytes (HTL) epitopes in the 26 subunit candidates and identify the best 11 of them to construct a multi-epitope vaccine for SARS-CoV-2 virus. The human population coverage, antigenicity, allergenicity, toxicity, physicochemical properties and secondary structure of the designed vaccine are evaluated via state-of-the-art bioinformatic approaches, showing good quality of the designed vaccine. The 3D structure of the designed vaccine is predicted, refined and validated by in silico tools. Finally, we optimize and insert the codon sequence into a plasmid to ensure the cloning and expression efficiency. In conclusion, this proposed artificial intelligence (AI) based vaccine discovery framework accelerates the vaccine design process and constructs a 694aa multi-epitope vaccine containing 16 B-cell epitopes, 82 CTL epitopes and 89 HTL epitopes, which is promising to fight the SARS-CoV-2 viral infection and can be further evaluated in clinical studies. Moreover, we trace the RNA mutations of the SARS-CoV-2 and ensure that the designed vaccine can tackle the recent RNA mutations of the virus.",

(B) In silico vaccine design by DeepVacPred framework. By replacing the many predictions, evaluations and selections with a DNN architecture inside the DeepVacPred framework, we are able to directly predict a very small number of potential vaccine subunits within a second and start the following evaluation and vaccine construction on a much smaller amount of data. www.nature.com/scientificreports/ the one step of B-cell epitope prediction, and when it comes to T-cell epitope prediction, a different tool such as NetMHCpan 26 is needed. No current tool is able to conduct multiple predictions and comprehensively analyze the results for us at once to directly identify the best vaccine subunits for further construction and evaluation. To overcome the above challenges of the in silico vaccine design, we propose DeepVacPred, a novel AI-based in silico multi-epitope vaccine design framework. We successfully replace the multiple necessary predictions and the comprehensive evaluations with a deep neural network (DNN) architecture. When the DNN takes one peptide sequence as input, it can then judge whether this input sequence can be a potential vaccine subunit. In the DeepVacPred framework, the number of potential vaccine subunits can be firstly reduced to around 30, then further evaluation and vaccine construction is done on the predicted subunits by reliable and popular in silico methods to construct the final vaccine. Our novel approach aims to achieve a much better efficiency of the in silico vaccine design.",

A fragment with multiple merits can be selected as a subunit of the final vaccine. For example, an ideal subunit should contain multiple B-cell epitopes and T-cell epitopes and it should have high antigenicity to trigger human protective reactions 22, 23 . These merits can be predicted by in silico approaches and currently there are numerous in silico vaccine design tools. However, these tools are designed to address only one of the several predictions at a time. Consequently, researchers have to overcome the time-consuming tasks of analyzing each individual prediction result from different tools while adopting a comprehensive view of the vaccine design.

The DeepVacPred framework further predicts the T-cell epitopes at these locations and discards the subunits which have less than 8 T-cell epitopes 36 . After this prediction, our DeepVacPred provides us with 26 potential vaccine subunits for further evaluation and construction (see Table 4 ). These subunits are very likely to contain B-cell epitopes and multiple T-cell epitopes. They are also very likely to have high antigenicity and low allergenicity. We start the following in silico vaccine design process directly from the predicted 26 vaccine subunits, which is very efficient.",

To avoid potential autoimmunity, we perform a BLASTp screening against the Uniprot database on those 11 vaccine subunits. A subunit with a higher-than-35% identity will be considered as homologous protein with human proteome. Among the 11 vaccine subunits we choose for the final vaccine construction, none of them show high degree of homology with the human proteome. The final vaccine contains an adjuvant, 50S ribosomal protein L2 49,50 (accession no. AXI95322.1), to improve the immune response 51 , linked with the amino (N) terminum of the multi-subunit sequence through an EAAAK linker 52 . The multi-subunit sequence has a CTL multi-epitope peptides region followed by an HTL multi-epitope peptides region. The CTL region is constructed by 6 subunits which have better performance in the CTL epitopes prediction. AAY linkers 52 are used in this region to fuse the subunits. The HTL region is constructed by 6 subunits which have better performance in the HTL epitopes prediction. GPGPG linkers 52 are used in this region to fuse the subunits. The two regions are linked through a GPGPG linker. In addition, Subunit 5 is used twice in both CTL and HTL region for its good performance in both CTL and HTL epitope predictions. In the end, a 6xHis tag is added at the C-terminal to Antigenicity, allergenicity and solubility evaluation. The antigenicity of the final multi-epitope vaccine sequence is evaluated by the Vaxijen 2.0 online server 34, 54 and the AntigenPro server 55 . We also evaluate the antigenicity of each vaccine subunit, including the adjuvant (see Table 9 ). The Vaxijen score for the whole final vaccine is 0.5705 with a virus model at a threshold of 0.4, suggesting a high antigenicity of our final vaccine. The AllergenFP 1.0 server and AllerTOP 2.0 server 56 predict the final vaccine and its every subunit to be non-allergenic (see Table 9 ).

In this model, 100% (694) amino acids in the final vaccine are modeled in four domains. The P-value quantifies the likelihood of the predicted model being worse than other models generated randomly. The P-value for this model is calculated to be 4.13 \u00d7 10 \u221214 , which is a very low value, suggesting high quality of this 3D model. The unnormalized Global Distance Test (uGDT) score measures the absolute model quality.

The predicted B-cell epitopes are highlighted in yellow, showing good surface accessibility. Global Distance Test-High Accuracy (GDT-HA) score measures the similarity between two protein structures. The GDT-HA score between this refined model and the initial model reaches a high value of 0.900, indicating that they have high similarity. The distance between atoms is measured by the Root Mean Square Deviation (RMSD) score. Lower RMSD value suggests better stability and usually an RMSD score ranges between 0 and 1.2 is acceptable. This model has an RMSD score of 0.580. Such RMSD score indicates stable protein structure. Molprobity score reflects the crystallographic resolution of the model. The MolProbity score of our identified vaccine model is 2.618, which is much lower than the initial model, showing that the refinement has lowered the critical errors of the 3D model. The Clash Score reflects the number of unfavorable all-atom steric overlaps and the refinement reduced the clash score of the model from 137.8 to 33.5, improving the model stability to a high level. The Ramachandran plot score represents the size of energetically favoured regions and usually a value greater than 85% is acceptable.

In this study, we selected a part of known epitopes and protective antigens to form the dataset and use it for training the DNN architecture. We use the simple bridging of one B-cell epitopes and one T-cell epitopes. With a more comprehensive dataset and more possibilities of epitope combinations, we will be able to develop a better, more comprehensive and quicker vaccine design tool. In spite of limited available datasets, the current framework can still deal with most of the situations now and provide an efficacious vaccine design.",
