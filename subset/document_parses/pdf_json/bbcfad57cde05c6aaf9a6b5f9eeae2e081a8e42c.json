Due to the scarcity of information about the new virus and the absence of specific and effective vaccines and antivirals for the prevention and treatment of the disease [6, 7] , the response to the COVID-19 pandemic at the local and global levels was initially grounded on non-pharmacological interventions that included, among others, social distancing and isolation measures, isolation of patients and screening of their contacts, and lockdown [8] [9] [10] . Previous epidemics showed that, while the interventions remained in force, mortality was reduced but, when they were withdrawn or relaxed, transmission was increased [11] .",

According to the method's criteria, we selected 15 MSM with different characteristics in each country. The following was used to classify these initial participants (seeds): place of residence (we chose the most populous state/district in each of the countries' regions), race (Caucasian/nonwhite), age (young, adult, or older adult), and schooling level (high school, undergraduate or graduate). Each seed received a link to the research and was instructed to invite at least 5 MSM from their social network until a significant sample was obtained within two months. To identify the seeds, we used the time location sampling (TLS) technique, changing the location to have access to the seeds [28, 29] . The two most popular geographic location-based dating apps (Grindr \u00ae and Hornet \u00ae ) [30] were used, and a direct approach through chat with online users who met the inclusion criteria and sample diversification was implemented.

Particularly, the MSM living in Brazil presented almost twice the chances of at-risk sexual exposure to HIV infection when compared to those living in Portugal. This can be explained by the fact that in Brazil, unlike the Portuguese scenario, there has been total lack of control of the pandemic for more than a year [32] , which was also verified at the time of data collection. For this country, even with the start of immunization against COVID-19, the speed at which it is taking place (less than the ideal) can compromise control of the pandemic and favor the emergence of variant strains, especially among the younger age groups with complete absence of immunization. Added to this, there is the instability in the management of the pandemic since its outbreak, which has recently culminated in a judicial inquiry commission against the federal government.",

In an unexpected scenario, in which their usual social supports (family and friends) have limited, and sometimes precluded contact, the search for a routine health monitoring is in a second place, but does not hinder the search for sexual experiences. In a risk compensation logic [40, 41] , the already known barriers to accessing health services (fear, stigma, and welcoming) are added to the risk of being exposed to COVID-19, in contrast to the pleasure and release offered by sex in a stressful situation. It is important to point out that failure to comply with the social distancing measures does not exempt MSM from the concern about at-risk exposure to HIV infection, since the behavior is an attempt to reduce the deleterious effects of the pandemic [18, 23, 42, 43] .",

Our data show that the MSM with a previous history of at-risk sexual exposure presented 8 times more chances of repeating it. It is important to notice how this reveals that social distancing did not create these behaviors, but increased them, although new studies of a longitudinal nature can investigate this trend and provide more robust findings. It is therefore necessary to understand how, in pandemic phases, in which access to the health services can be severely affected, such as in Portugal in the months prior to data collection, it is possible to continue guaranteeing this population access to post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) as well as other risk reduction measures.",

Regarding this, a number of studies [17, 44] have shown, for example, the adoption of PrEP as the strategy of some MSM to mitigate SARS-CoV-2, which is considered inefficient. In this study, MSM who have already presented COVID-19 symptoms seem to have felt more engaged in practicing unprotected anal sex, probably because of the sense of safety given by their immunological memory. Although durable immunity against secondary COVID-19 disease is a possibility [45] , relaxation of the preventive measures and contact is not indicated, considering the possibility of reinfection and new strains/variants.",

Furthermore, the survey instrument was only used to conduct sampling during COVID-19 preventative measures and due to the lack of studies addressing the topic in the literature, comparisons had to be made with previous studies that used different instruments. The data were collected online, with self-reported information, being impossible to verify their veracity, and they only represent those with access to Internet.

With a more racially and economically diverse sample, we may expect to observe greater variation in the negative experiences with COVID-19 (in terms of increases in structural vulnerability) [49] .

This is a concerning trend that needs to be studied in more depth.
