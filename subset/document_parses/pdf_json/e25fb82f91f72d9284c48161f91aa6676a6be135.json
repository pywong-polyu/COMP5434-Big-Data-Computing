Theoretically, by employing choice functions, we show that (i) both MR and JSA result in no in-group blocking pairs, and (ii) JSA is weakly group strategy-proof, ensures that at least one disadvantaged is not worse off, and when reservation quotas are carefully chosen then no disadvantaged student is worse-off. We show that each of these properties is not satisfied by DISC. In the general setting, we show that there is no clear winner in terms of the matchings provided by DISC, JSA and MR, from the perspective of disadvantaged students. We however characterize a condition for markets, that we term high competitiveness, where JSA dominates MR for disadvantaged students. This condition is verified, in particular, in certain markets when there is a higher demand for seats than supply, and the performances of disadvantaged students are significantly lower than that of advantaged students. Data from NYC DOE satisfy the high competitiveness condition, and for this dataset our empirical results corroborate our theoretical predictions, showing the superiority of JSA. We believe that the discovery program, and more generally affirmative action mechanisms, can be changed for the better by implementing the JSA mechanism, leading to incentives for the top-performing disadvantaged students while providing many benefits of the affirmative action program.",

A blocking pair is a pair of student s 1 and school c 1 that prefer each other to their matches, thus violating the priority of student s 1 at school c 1 and creating dissatisfaction among students and schools. Moreover, we find that this program benefits lower-performing disadvantaged students more than top-performing disadvantaged students (in terms of their rankings of their assigned schools), thus unintentionally creating an incentive to under-perform. See Figure 2 for a depiction of our empirical analysis, where top-performing students (with ranks 0 \u223c 500) attend less preferred schools under the discovery program, unlike low-performing students (rank 500-1000) who get matched to better ranked schools (lower numeric rank is better). These drawbacks of the discovery program are not simply an artifact of the data from NYC DOE, but are, as we show theoretically, properties about the current implementation of the discovery program. Therefore, our goal in this paper is to explore other affirmative action mechanisms, so that we can propose practical modifications to how the discovery program is implemented, while alleviating the above-mentioned drawbacks.",

This mechanism has been well studied in the literature (see, e.g., Hafalir et al. (2013) ).

As one can immediately see from the table, the current implementation of the discovery program does not satisfy any of the attractive features we investigate, yet the other two affirmative action mechanisms, MR and JSA, satisfy all these properties. This is even true when all the schools rank students in the same order, as in the NYC SHS admission market where students are ranked based on their SHSAT scores. We additionally demonstrate these findings empirically by computational experiments using the admission data on NYC SHSs (the details can be found in Section 5). These results suggest that the discovery program could benefit by replacing the current implementation with either minority reserve or joint seat allocation. This result calls for a direct comparison of those mechanisms. We say that a mechanism A (weakly) dominates another mechanism B for disadvantaged students if A places all disadvantaged students in schools they like at least as much as the schools they are placed in by B. Our results from Table 1 seem to suggest that the discovery program mechanism could be dominated by either minority reserve or joint seat allocation.

On the other hand, for minority reserve, the numbers of disadvantaged students admitted match exactly the reservation quota. This is because after disadvantaged students take up the reserved seats, the remaining disadvantaged students cannot compete against advantaged students for the general seats and are thus not admitted. The phenomenon is exactly the high competitiveness condition we discussed in Section 4.2 and is particularly true for our dataset since the number of students are much higher than the number of available seats, and disadvantaged students are performing systematically worse than advantaged students, as one can see in Figure 3b .",

This is consistent with our discussion in Section 3 (see Table 1 ). We further investigate who are the disadvantaged students that are worse off under the discovery program, and we show the results in Figure 2 . Interestingly, the disadvantaged students who are performing relatively well are the ones who are being admitted to schools they prefer less (dots on the upper left side of Figure 2 ). These are essentially the disadvantaged students who are assigned to general seats during the first stage of the discovery program mechanism. Because there are fewer seats during the first stage of the discovery program mechanism (as compared to the no affirmative action mechanism), the competition is fiercer and thus, these disadvantaged students got assigned to worse schools. Not only does this phenomenon imply that the discovery program mechanism is unfair to these well-performing disadvantaged students, but it also hints at a situation where students have the incentive to under-perform in the admission exams. This certainly is in sharp contrast to the purpose of education and should not be a consequence of any applicable mechanism.",

The condition on the the equal probability of each school appearing first in preference lists apply, for instance, in classical random markets, such as Knuth et al. (1990) , Pittel (1989 Pittel ( , 1992 . q R > n log n applies when there are few schools compared to the number of seats, while the condition on the relative rankings of students applies when disadvantaged students perform systematically worse than advantaged students. For a comparison, in the data from NYC DOE, we have that the average reservation quota is q r = 208 > n = 8, the average number of seats at each school is q = 635, n + n(q \u2212 q R ) = 3424, and q R n = 1664. Omitting from the comparison the terms logarithmic and sublogarithmic in n (n = 8, hence they would only help the hypothesis of Theorem 7 to be satisfied), we see that the 1664-th ranked disadvantaged student performs at par with the 6848-th advantaged student, hence well within the hypothesis of the theorem.",

To prove the proposition, instead of carrying out the deferred acceptance algorithm as we introduced in Section 2 based on Roth (1984) for choice function models, we consider an equivalent execution of the algorithm when choice functions C are responsive. This algorithm was introduced by McVitie and Wilson (1971) and it similarly runs in rounds. The algorithm starts with all students unmatched. In every round, one student s who is not (temporarily) matched applies to his or her most preferred school c that has not yet rejected him or her. Let S c denote the set of students c has temporarily accepted at the end of the previous round. School c temporarily accepts C c (S c \u222a {s}) and rejects the rest. Note that during the algorithm, at every round, the student s can be arbitrarily selected. Hence, we now consider a particular execution of the algorithm on the auxiliary instance (i.e., the order in which students are selected). The execution has three stages, and they match exactly to the three stages of the discovery program mechanism. In the first stage, the algorithm can only select students who would apply to schools of type c . Since after this stage, students will only apply to schools of type c , the students who are temporarily matched in the first stage would not be rejected in later stages. That is, the temporary assignment at the end of the first stage becomes permanent, and it is matching \u00b5 DISC 1 . For the second stage, the algorithm can only select disadvantaged students. Since schools of type c prefers disadvantaged students to advantaged students, the temporary assignment at the end of the second stage is also permanent and it corresponds to \u00b5 DISC 2 . In the last stage, the algorithm continues without restriction until it terminates. Since there are only advantaged students applying to schools of type c at this final stage, the matching finalized at this stage is \u00b5 DISC 3 .",

We first show that matchings in the original instance I 1 := (G, >, q) and matchings in the auxiliary instance I 2 := (G aux , > JSA-a S , > aux C , q) can be transformed from each other. One direction is straightforward. Given a matching \u00b5 2 in instance I 2 , its corresponding matching \u00b5 1 in instance I 1 has \u00b5 1 (s) = \u03c9(\u00b5 2 (s)) for all students s \u2208 S. For the other direction, let \u00b5 1 be a matching in instance I 1 , we can construct its corresponding matching \u00b5 2 in instance I 2 as follows. For every school c, \u00b5 2 (c ) = max(\u00b5 1 (c), > c , q G c ) and \u00b5 2 (c ) = \u00b5 1 (c) \\ \u00b5 2 (c ). Let \u03c8 denote the above mapping from matchings in I 2 to matchings in I 1 , and let \u03c8 \u22121 denote the above mapping for the reverse direction. By construction, a matching \u00b5 of I 1 is stable in I 1 if and only if \u03c8 \u22121 (\u00b5) is stable in I 2 . Therefore, the student-optimal stable matching in I 1 can be obtained from the student-optimal stable matching in I 2 via mapping \u03c8 \u22121 , and the claim follows.",

Since students are not asked to report their preferences over different types of seats, we can only make some inferences based on the pattern of the preferences submitted by students. For the second reason, recall that in Section 4.3, we show how different mechanisms expand differently students' original preferences over schools to their preferences over reserved and general seats. Hence, our observations aim to shed some light on the validity of these expansions. For the following discussion, we forgo the assumption that participation in the summer enrichment program does not affect students' preference for schools.",

Hence, for students residing in Staten Island, since transportation to other boroughs are extremely limited and lengthy, it is reasonable to assume the school-over-seat hypothesis when comparing Staten Island Tech to any other specialized high school. From the same type of tables for other school districts which we include in Appendix F, we observe similar patterns: students in district 10 strongly prefers Bronx Science (B) and students in district 29 strongly prefers Queens High School for the Sciences at York (Q).

All students prefer school c 1 to c 2 . Both schools have priority order s M 1 > s m 1 > s m 2 . Then,That is, the matching under any of the mechanisms with affirmative action Pareto dominates the matching obtained without affirmative action for disadvantaged students.Example 5. Consider the instance with students S M = {s M 1 , s M 2 }, S m = {s m 1 , s m 2 } and schools C = {c 1 , c 2 }. Both schools have a quota of 2 and a reservation quota of 1. All students prefer school c 1 to c 2 , and all schools have priority order s M 1 > s m 1 > s M 2 > s m 2 . Then,Note that the reservation quotas is a smart reserve. Disadvantaged student s m 2 strictly prefers \u00b5 DISC to the other matching, while s m 1 strictly prefers the other matching to \u00b5 DISC .The quotas and reservation quotas of schools, and the preference lists of students are given below.To see that the reservation quotas is a smart reserve, the matching under the no affirmative action mechanism isThe matchings under minority reserve and joint seat allocation are:Disadvantaged student s m 1 and s m 2 are indifferent between \u00b5 MR and \u00b5 JSA , s m 3 strictly prefers \u00b5 MR to \u00b5 JSA , but s m 4 strictly prefers \u00b5 JSA to \u00b5 MR .Appendix C: Missing Proofs C.1. From Section 3.2Proof of Proposition 2. The substitutability property was shown in Hafalir et al. (2013) , but we include the proof here for completeness. Let S 1 \u2286 S be a subset of students, s \u2208 C MR c (S 1 ) be a student selected by the choice function, and S 2 be a subset of students such that s \u2208 S 2 \u2286 S 1 . We want to show that s \u2208 C MR c (S 2 ). Consider the following two cases. The first case is when s \u2208 S R 1 . Here, it is immediate that s \u2208 S R 2 := max(S 2 \u2229 S m , > c , q R c ) since S 2 \u2229 S m \u2286 S 1 \u2229 S m and thus, s \u2208 C MR c (S 2 ).The other case is when s \u2208 C MR c (S 1 ) \\ S R 1 . Our argument for the first case implies that S R 1 \u2229 S 2 \u2286 S R 2 and thus, we have S 2 \\ S R 2 \u2286 S 2 \\ S R 1 \u2286 S 1 \\ S R 1 . Hence, we also have s \u2208 C MR c (S 2 ). Next, for consistency, let S 2 be a subset of students with C MR c (S 1 ) \u2286 S 2 \u2286 S 1 , and we want to show that C MR c (S 1 ) = C MR c (S 2 ). By the definition of the choice function, it is clear that S R 1 = S R 2 since S R 1 \u2286 S 2 . With the same reasoning, we additionally have max(. Therefore, the claim follows. Lastly, for q c -acceptance, we first have that |C MR c (S 1 )| \u2264 |S R 1 | + q c \u2212 |S R 1 | = q c , where the inequality follows directly from the definition. It remains to show that when |S 1 | < q c , we have C MR c (S 1 ) = S 1 . This is immediate from the definition of the choice function.Proof of Propsoition 4. Assume by contradiction that (s, c) is an in-group blocking pair for \u00b5 MR .Let s be the student in the same group as s such that s \u2208 \u00b5 MR (c) and s > c s . Then, by definition, which means (s, c) is a blocking pair for \u00b5 MR . However, this contradicts stability of \u00b5 MR .",

First, for substitutability, let s \u2208 C JSA c (S 1 ) and let S 2 be a subset of students such that s \u2208 S 2 \u2286 S 1 . We want to show that s \u2208 C JSA c (S 2 ) and we consider the following three cases. The first case is when s \u2208 S G 1 . In this case, it is immediate that s \u2208 S G 2 := max(S 2 , > c , q G c ) since S 2 \u2286 S 1 . This first case in particular implies that S G 1 \u2229 S 2 \u2286 S G 2 and thus, S 2 \\ S G 2 \u2286 S 2 \\ S G 1 \u2286 S 1 \\ S G 1 . Hence, in the second case where s \u2208 S R 1 , we similarly have s \u2208 S R 2 := max(S 2 \u2229 S m \\ S G 2 , > c , q R c ). Note that this argument for the second case also implies that. Therefore, in all these three cases, we have s \u2208 C JSA c (S 2 ) and thus C JSA c is substitutable.Next, for consistency, let S 2 be a subset of students with C JSA c (S 1 ) \u2286 S 2 \u2286 S 1 , and we want to show that C JSA c (S 1 ) = C JSA c (S 2 ). By the definition of the choice function, it is clear thatWith the same reasoning, we additionally have that max(. Therefore, the choice function is consistent. Lastly, for q c -acceptant, we first have that |C JSAwhere the inequality follows directly from the definition. It remains to show that when |S 1 | < q c , we have C JSA c (S 1 ) = S 1 . This is immediate from the definition of the choice function.Proof of Proposition 6.
