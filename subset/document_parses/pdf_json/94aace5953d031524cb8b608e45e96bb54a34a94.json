            "text": "Background: Disruption of alveolar epithelial cell (AEC) differentiation is implicated in distal lung diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, and lung adenocarcinoma that impact morbidity and mortality worldwide. Elucidating underlying disease pathogenesis requires a mechanistic molecular understanding of AEC differentiation. Previous studies have focused on changes of individual transcription factors, and to date no study has comprehensively characterized the dynamic, global epigenomic alterations that facilitate this critical differentiation process in humans. Results: We comprehensively profiled the epigenomic states of human AECs during type 2 to type 1-like cell differentiation, including the methylome and chromatin functional domains, and integrated this with transcriptomewide RNA expression data. Enhancer regions were drastically altered during AEC differentiation. Transcription factor binding analysis within enhancer regions revealed diverse interactive networks with enrichment for many transcription factors, including NKX2-1 and FOXA family members, as well as transcription factors with less well characterized roles in AEC differentiation, such as members of the MEF2, TEAD, and AP1 families. Additionally, associations among transcription factors changed during differentiation, implicating a complex network of heterotrimeric complex switching in driving differentiation. Integration of AEC enhancer states with the catalog of enhancer elements in the Roadmap Epigenomics Mapping Consortium and Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) revealed that AECs have similar epigenomic structures to other profiled epithelial cell types, including human mammary epithelial cells (HMECs), with NKX2-1 serving as a distinguishing feature of distal lung differentiation.",

While environmental factors are established contributors to the development and progression of distal lung diseases [4] [5] [6] , little is understood about how the underlying epigenetic architecture of the adult lung is disrupted in these disease processes. The distal lung epithelium is comprised of two main epithelial cell types, alveolar epithelial type 1 (AT1) and type 2 (AT2) cells, each with distinct physiological roles, morphology, and molecular profiles [7] . Understanding the molecular interrelationship between these two diverse cell types and the distinct role each cell type plays in disease initiation and progression is key to developing approaches to combat diseases of the distal lung.",

Previous studies have examined general epigenetic activation and repression states [8] , and specific transcription factor interactions with chromatin state [13] ; however, there has been no systematic profiling of global epigenomic alterations during AEC differentiation to date. Gene expression can be regulated by either activation or repression. Enhancers are epigenetic regulatory elements that can act at great distances from their target promoters to control activation of gene expression, and can also play a key role in cell type specification and regulation of disease processes [14] . They are characterized by a nucleosome-depleted stretch of DNA that allows for transcription factor binding. This exposed DNA region is flanked by well-positioned nucleosomes decorated with post-translational modifications indicative of active enhancer activity. Specifically, nucleosomes at the site of active enhancers show co-occurrence of histone 3 lysine 27 acetylation (H3K27Ac) and histone 3 lysine 4 monomethylation (H3K4me1). Open DNA regions within the center of the enhancer region can be interrogated genome-wide using Formaldehyde-Assisted Isolation of Regulatory Elements (FAIRE), followed by massive parallel sequencing [15] . The open region identified by FAIRE is commonly bound by transcription factors that function to regulate downstream target gene expression levels. Often these regions are also found to be depleted of CpG methylation [16] .",

The 2D model of alveolar epithelial cell differentiation has been in use for over 35 years [17, 18] , and has been extensively used by the field [19] to discover and characterize markers of AT2 and AT1 cells [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] , which have subsequently been confirmed by recent single cell consortia findings using primary cells [11, 26] . The 2D model of AEC differentiation has also paved the way for understanding alveolar responses to injury [27, 28] , environmental exposures [29] , cellular transport properties [30] , and alveolar repair [31] . Strikingly, results initially derived using this model system have been verified in vivo, such as the plasticity of AT1 cell differentiation [32] [33] [34] , which was confirmed later using mouse models [34] [35] [36] [37] , as well as in the more recently developed 3D organoid model of alveolar formation [34, 38] . It has been over 14 years since this model was translated into human tissue systems [39, 40] and the results generated from studies utilizing this model have shown a high degree of relevance to human lung differentiation and disease [27, 41] . AEC grown in the 2D model are also able to form tight epithelial monolayers consistent with the in vivo lung, which can be measured by transepithelial resistance [18] , a property that is not quantifiable in the 3D organoid model. In sum, this model results in AT1-like cells, which recapitulate many of the gene expression patterns, physiological behaviors, and morphological characteristics of AT1 cells found in vivo [42] [43] [44] .",

We focused our study on enhancers as the epigenetic elements that most influence gene expression during differentiation, and within them we found enrichment for high-confidence transcription factors predicted to bind to these regions and that likely act in concert to direct AEC differentiation. We then utilized the compendium of enhancer signatures across the spectrum of human tissues to identify enhancers and associated transcription factors that were specific for human alveolar epithelial AT2 and AT1-like cells, which can be of future utility in the generation of cell-type specific models of diseases arising from the alveolar epithelium. We present herein a comprehensive profile of epigenetic alterations that occur during AEC differentiation and describe their influence on coordinated gene expression patterning to determine phenotypic transitions between AT2 and AT1-like cells and direct the acquisition of an AT1-like cell fate.",

AT2 cells were extracted from explant donor lungs that had no prior evidence of chronic lung disease and allowed to differentiate into AT1-like cells in vitro over the course of 6 days utilizing well-established protocols [8, 46] . Preestablished quality control measures ensured that the AEC differentiated appropriately in 2D culture (Fig. S1 ). Next, the AT2 cell population (D0), transitional AEC (D4), and AT1-like cells (D6) underwent DNA isolation for whole genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) (1 million cells each), chromatin fixation for ChIP-seq (5 million cells each ChIP) and corresponding RNA isolation for bulk RNA-seq (1 million cells each) to correlate altered epigenetic states with changes in gene expression from the same population of cells. RNA-seq from the 2D AEC differentiation model underwent differential expression analysis (Fig. 1A) which demonstrated that known AT1 and AT2 cell markers were enriched in the D6 AT1-like cell population. Additionally, genes differentially expressed in the 2D AEC differentiation model were compared to recently published single cell RNAseq datasets generated by three separate consortia (Fig.  S2) . Concordance between the 2D AEC differentiation model and AT1/AT2 cell markers within primary human and mouse lung single cell analysis was highly significant (p < 2.2 e-16 for all three consortia findings), and 62 genes were identified as AT1 cell enriched across four datasets (Supplemental Table 1 ), including known AT1 cell genes AGER, CAV1/CAV2, CLDN18, CLIC3/CLIC5, GPRC5A, HOPX, IGFBP7, PDPN, RTKN2, SEMA3B/ SEMA3E, and SPOCK2 [7, 10, 34, 42, 47] .",

During the ChIP process, nonprotein bound DNA fragments in the supernatant were collected as \"free DNA\" and profiled using FAIRE-seq to determine open genomic regions. Inspection of the ratio of peak enrichment to input background revealed that the ChIP-seq data were of acceptable quality for subsequent data analysis (Figs. S3-S5). We also determined whether maximal peak occupancy was reached by subdividing ChIP-seq datasets and re-performing peak calling analysis to generate a curve for determining maximal peak occupancy (Figs. S3-S5). Our samples had reached the plateau for the number of peaks called, indicating that our sequencing depths were sufficient and had captured the vast majority of the binding sites for the given antibodies. Of note, data quality as measured by peak enrichment from Donor 1 was slightly better than Donor 2, and was therefore used as the discovery dataset, with Donor 2 used as the validation set. The genomic distribution of each epigenetic signature was then mapped back to the hg19 genome and the correlation between samples and the distribution of each mark was determined ( Fig. 1B) .",

Unmethylated regions (UMRs) have less than 10% methylation levels, extend over regions > 10 kb, and have been associated with loci important for cell fate determination [48] [49] [50] . Low-methylated regions (LMRs) have between 10 and 30% methylation levels and are associated with active enhancers [51] . Partially methylated domains (PMDs) have between 30 and 70% overall methylation levels, tend to stretch for many kilobases (kb), and are associated with polycomb complex and facultative heterochromatin [52] . The last category which is not explicitly defined by MethylSeekR comprises fully methylated domains (> 70% methylated) which are associated with constitutive heterochromatin. We integrated our WGBS domain data with the ChIP-seq data using the Diffbind package in R to calculate and visualize a correlation matrix of peak overlaps and found that partially methylated regions (PMRs) in AECs were more closely associated with the repressive chromatin mark H3K27me3 and the insulator CTCF (Fig. 1B) . CTCF acts as a long-range homodimeric insulator that regulates three-dimensional chromatin structure [53, 54] . Each mark within this group clustered with itself rather than clustering together by differentiation day, indicating that these marks did not undergo major shifts during AEC differentiation.",

We compared the gain or loss of each epigenetic mark profiled against changes in the HOMER-annotated nearest neighbor gene expression as a rough measure of association, with the caveat that enhancers can often target genes across great distances and in addition the rate of nearest-neighbor enhancer interaction varies across tissues and development [56] (Fig. 1C) . We observed that loss of H3K4me1, H3K27Ac, H3K9Ac, FAIRE, and gain of H3K27me3 were all highly significantly correlated to loss of nearby gene expression from differential RNA-seq analysis during differentiation (blue, all had p < 3.3 \u00d7 10 \u2212 5 ). Loss of LMR signal was also significantly correlated to loss of gene expression, albeit to a lesser extent than the other marks (p < 2.0 \u00d7 10 \u2212 4 ). The gain of H3K27Ac, H3K9Ac, and H3K79me3 were significantly correlated with increases in expression of nearby genes (red).

We saw a significant enrichment of FAIRE signal at the center of each predicted enhancer, indicating that open regions were centered around transcription factor footprints as previously reported [57] [58] [59] . In addition, we saw a bimodal distribution of H3K4me1 and H2K27Ac spaced~+/\u2212 100 bp from the center of the peak, indicating nucleosomal positioning consistent with known enhancer elements as well as enrichment of enhancerassociated marks. The enrichment signal faded at~+/\u2212 2000 bp from the center of the peak, indicating that, on average, epigenetic signals for enhancer regions extended no further than~4 kb. As FAIRE data most closely capture TF binding footprints in between the enhancerdecorated nucleosomes, we utilized the FAIRE data in both AT2 (D0) and AT1-like (D6) cells to examine the relative enrichment for all predicted TF motifs contained in the HOMER database (Fig. 2B) . We observed that the motifs for the TF FOS and, to a lesser extent, similar members of the AP-1 family, were the most statistically significant in the AT2 cell FAIRE regions. In contrast, we identified several TF motifs that were highly significantly enriched in AT1-like FAIRE samples, most prominently TEA domain family member -1 (TEAD1). Notably, there were several TF motifs enriched in both cell types, such as forkhead box protein A1 (FOXA1), indicating that FOXA1 may exert its function as a pioneering TF in both cell types. To identify those motifs which demonstrated cell-type preference, we performed subtractive analysis between AT1-like and AT2 cell motif enrichment (Fig. 2C ). This demonstrated that the TEAD motifs were much more significantly enriched in the AT1-like cell motifs consistent with recent reports [13] . FOS was the most significantly enriched motif in the FAIRE open regions of AT2 cells. We previously observed FOS motif enrichment in genomic regions that were open and decorated with H3K9Ac in AT2 cells that then became closed and covered in the H3K27me3 repressive mark in AT1-like cells during AEC differentiation [8] .",

Comparison of these predicted altered binding sites with gene expression changes throughout differentiation yielded subsets of TFs where motif enrichment in enhancers decreased along with loss of TF expression (Fig. 2E ). This set of TFs included CCAAT-enhancer binding protein delta (CEBPD), nuclear factor kappa-B (NFKB), FOS and activating transcription factor-3 (ATF3). Consistent with these results, our previous work demonstrated a decrease of NFKB and FOS signaling during AEC differentiation [8] . In contrast, we observed increased RNA expression during AEC differentiation and increased motif enrichment for FOXA1, FOXA2, signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT1/STAT3/ STAT6), nuclear factor 1 (NF1), transcription factor 3/12 (TCF3/TCF12), and TEAD1 (Fig.  2E ).

TFs with strong signals near the center of a FAIRE peak [62] , that can displace histones and create the FAIRE open region signal, would be detected using this method,. However, we also observed this method working for non-pioneering TF, such as TEAD1 on D4 (purple) and D6 (red). Conversely, lack of a discernable peak near the center of the FAIRE region would argue against a functional relationship between the FAIRE open region signal and TF binding, as we observed for TEAD1 in AT2 cells (blue). We then ranked all TFs from smallest footprint to largest footprint as a measure of predictive strength of involvement (Fig. 2G ). We observed that the HOMER calculated p value did not perfectly correlate to peak enrichment at the center of the FAIRE peak, arguing that using only the p value calculations to assign involvement of a TF may over-interpret the involvement of a given TF in the pathway being studied. Using enrichment at the center of the FAIRE peak as a metric for ranking TFs, we observed the pioneering TF FOXA1 as the top-enriched candidate in FAIRE-marked open regions in D0, D4, and D6 cells. Overall, D4 and D6 motif enrichment for these top factors was highly correlated, with the notable exceptions of NFkB and TCF12. Additionally, TEAD showed the largest change between D0 and D4/D6. In sum, we identified several TFs that are predicted to regulate enhancer dynamics and cellular phenotype during AEC differentiation. These results suggest that rather than a single factor, a network of TFs is coordinated in a temporal fashion to orchestrate AEC reprogramming and gene expression changes requisite for AT1-like cell fate.",

            "text": "To confirm our observations that a large number of TFs were significantly enriched in AEC enhancer regions and associated with distinct sets of differentially expressed genes during differentiation, we applied knowledge from the biochemistry field about the spacing between heterodimeric TF complexes that bind site-specifically to DNA to understand how TF families were changing their associations during AEC differentiation. The majority of characterized TF heterodimeric interactions are thought to occur between binding partners that rest on DNA within 50 bp of each other, based on many decades of steric and mutational analyses [63] [64] [65] . Therefore, we began by running HOMER transcription factor binding site (TFBS) prediction on AT2 and AT1-like enhancer regions. Next, we annotated where all of the top 100 significantly enriched motifs in each cell type sat within their respective enhancers. In many cases, multiple instances of a given motif were found in a given enhancer region. To reduce overrepresentation of these regions, we set a cut-off of up to 10 motif instances in a given enhancer, which encompassed over 99% of all significantly enriched TF motifs from our initial list of top 100, hereafter referred to as the \"Interrogated Motif\" (Fig. 3A ). Next, we ran HOMER on the 100 bp region surrounding the Interrogated Motif to determine which TF families occurred as \"Associated Motifs\" within that The resultant heatmaps, showing the Interrogated Motifs as columns and Associated (secondary) Motifs as rows, showed several TF motif associations, but overall there was a large divergence in Associated Motif associations over days in culture. As expected, family members with a similar core motif sequence displayed similar enrichments for Associated Motifs, i.e., all ETS family members with the core CAGGAA sequence were predicted to have similar Associated Motif partners. This resulted in clusters of blue colored-Associated Motif families that were associated with the primary motif. Interestingly, AP1 and MAF family members share the same core TGAxxTCA sequence but differ widely in their Associated Motif association (Fig. 3B ). AP1 family members were tightly associated with ETS, FOX, and members of the basic Helix-Loop-Helix family, whereas significant association of nuclear receptors (NRs) as Associated Motifs was only observed in MAF family member Interrogated Motifs. ETS family members, and in particular Evt5, have been shown to regulate AT2 cell fate as well as FOX factors, validating these findings [66, 67] . Also, in AT2 cells, TEAD family member Associated Motifs with a core sequence GGAAT were found nearby AP1 family Interrogated motifs. This is in contrast to FAIRE results, which showed enrichment for TEAD family members within FAIRE regions only within AT1like cells.",

Some families, such as TCF and SMAD that were not detected in AT2 cells, were now significantly associated with multiple Interrogated Motifs. Beyond this, many families of TFs split, so that different family members, with a nearly identical core binding sequence, showed drastically altered associations with Interrogated Motifs on D4.

First, we isolated the AP1/MAF family of TFs which had the highest overall significance at each day, and were located centrally in the network analysis. AP1/ MAF family members share a core GATxxxTCA motif, however specificity for flanking and intervening sequences around these core nucleotides varies widely within the TF family. Plotting motif significance within enhancers at each timepoint of AEC differentiation against their overall expression level allowed us to visualize how their enrichments were changing over time in culture (Fig. 4A) . We observed that FOS and ATF3 were the most highly expressed AP1/MAF family members at D0, with decreased expression on D4 and D6. In contrast, FOSL2 and to a lesser extent JUNB expression increased over differentiation while simultaneously increasing in motif significance. For the rest of the AP1/ MAF family, expression was either negligible (ex., BACH2), or despite expression changes during differentiation their motif enrichment remained relatively constant (ex., NFE2L2, MAFB, MAFF).",

Overall there were slight decreases in significance for FOXA1 and FOXO3 motif enrichment by days in culture, despite increasing expression of these factors, whereas FOXP1 motif enrichment increased dramatically even though there was no change in RNA expression.

While HOXB13 was the factor with predicted highest associated motif significance (Fig.  4I) , we did not observed expression of HOXB13 in 2D AEC RNAseq. This may indicate that other Homeobox family members with similar core binding sequences are responsible for this signature. We also observed increased association between FOXP1 and SOX4 on D4 and D6.

It is known that FOXA1 can translate epigenetic signatures into enhancer driven lineage-specific transcriptional patterns by acting as a pioneering transcription factor to open chromatin and coordinate cellular differentiation [79, 80] . Therefore, we decided to study the predicted binding behavior of FOXA1 in relation to other TFBS motifs within enhancers. The typical nucleotide spacing of TFs bound together in a heterodimeric complex is between 1 and 50 bp depending on the factors involved [63] [64] [65] . To further characterize which of the identified TFs might associate with FOXA1 to maintain AT2 cellular identity or redirect FOXA1 to alternate enhancers to promote AT1-like differentiation, we gathered +/\u2212 50 bp from the predicted FOXA1 binding site within cell-type specific enhancers and re-ran the HOMER motif analysis, excluding FOXA1 as it was a criterion for sequence selection. We found that in AT2 cells, FOXA1 motifs co-occur alongside ETS family member motifs with high statistical significance (Fig. 5A) . This predicted association shifts in AT1-like cells, where TEAD family members and MEF2C are highly significantly enriched motifs alongside FOXA1. Consistent with these observations, we saw a decrease in ETS1 expression and increase in MEF2C during AEC differentiation, providing a possible mechanism for FOXA1 transcriptional heterodimers based on relative expression levels of cofactors. In addition, we observed enrichment of NKX2-1 and NFI in proximity of both AT2 and AT1-like FOXA1 predicted motifs.",

Further, the physical interaction between FOXA1 and NKX2-1 has been observed previously in AEC [82] , bolstering confidence that our analysis is identifying transcription factor complex interactions that influence epigenetic enhancer state alterations during AEC differentiation. To further characterize this relationship, we analyzed the distance from FOXA1 motifs to enriched TFBS in AT2 cells (Fig. 5B ) and AT1-like cells (Fig. 5C) . Strikingly, we observed a high degree of enrichment for NKX2-1 motifs \u2212 40 bp away from the predicted FOXA1 binding motif in both AT2 and AT1-like cells, which could indicate an interactive relationship between the two throughout AEC differentiation as previously reported [82] . In addition, we observed enrichment of the FRA1/FOSL1 motif at the + 20 bp position from the FOXA1 motif in AT2 cells, as well as a high level of enrichment for the MEF2C motif at the \u2212 10 bp position in AT1-like cells.

AT2 cells have been thoroughly studied as a cell population that can give rise to lung adenocarcinoma [83] [84] [85] . While using a lung cancer cell line model is not ideal for studying differentiation of normal human cells, it is the only publicly available model of human lung origin where ChIPseq for FOXA1, NKX2-1, and both enhancer marks H3K27Ac and H3K4me1 have been generated with high enough quality for downstream analysis [86, 87] . We defined enhancers in A549 cells using the same criteria as in AEC, namely > 50% overlap of H3K27Ac and H3K4me1 peaks. The epigenome is known to be heavily dysregulated during the carcinogenic process, so we further subclassified enhancers in A549 cells by > 50% peak overlap with our previously defined AEC enhancers. This resulted in enhancers of three categories: A549 enhancers that were also present in AT2 cells (1500 regions, 5.2% of total A549 enhancers); A549 enhancers that were also present in AT1-like cells (9678 regions, 32.8% of A549 enhancers); and A549 enhancers that were uniquely present in the cancerous cell line (18,303 regions, 62% of A549 enhancers) and may therefore may represent dysregulated enhancer activity. We did not detect discernable differences in TFBS motif enrichment between subsets of A549 enhancers based on their overlap with enhancers in AT2 and AT1-like cells (Fig.  S6) . To determine TF occupancy within these categories of enhancers, we reanalyzed ChIP-seq data for endogenous FOXA1 originally generated by the ENCODE Consortium [88] , and a separate study that determined occupancy for ectopically expressed NKX2-1 in A549 cells [89] . Unfortunately, publicly available MEF2C and FRA1/FOSL1 ChIPseq datasets were not available in lung-derived cell lines.",

For shared A549-AT2 enhancers, 39.6% had co-occupancy of NKX2-1 and FOXA1 (Fig. 5D) . Similarly, NKX2-1 and FOXA1 peaks were co-occurrent in 34.3% of A549-AT1 enhancers.

Together this indicated that cooccupancy of FOXA1 and NKX2-1 within \"normal\" AEC enhancers occurred approximately three times more often than within A549 cancer-specific enhancers. Indeed, almost 60% of cancer-specific A549 enhancers lacked any binding for FOXA1 or NKX2-1 (Fig. 5D) , suggesting that the colocalization of FOXA1 and NKX2-1 observed in A549 cells is primarily driven by enhancers preserved in normal tissues.",

In AT2 cell-type enhancers that are also present in A549 cells, FOXA1 and NKX2-1 exhibited enrichment that was spread across the central 500 bp of the enhancer peaks (Fig. 5E ). In contrast, AT1like cell enhancers also present in A549 cells showed a high degree of enrichment for both factors toward the central 100 bp of the enhancer peaks. Based on known binding dynamics for TFs within enhancers, we would expect TFs involved in activation and maintenance of the active enhancer to be clustered toward the center of the enhancer region (Fig. 5F ). In cancer-specific enhancers in A549 cells, there was far less enrichment for both NKX2-1 and FOXA1, with no obvious differences in TF position relative to the center of the peak (Fig.  5G) . Intriguingly, the NKX2-1 and FOXA1 datasets both exhibited a dip at the exact center of the peak for AEC-shared enhancers, which may be due to the presence of another factor. To investigate what factor might be bound there, we extracted the central 100 bp from those AT1-like enhancers shared with A549 cells that also were co-occupied by NKX2-1 and FOXA1. JunB (p = 3.2 \u00d7 10 \u2212 16 ) and MEF2C (p = 1.4 \u00d7 10 \u2212 8 ) were the predicted factors to bind this center-of-the-peak region.

To investigate this, we utilized publicly available high-quality ChIP-seq datasets from normal tissues profiled by the ROADMAP epigenomics project (76 samples) and ENCODE (6 samples) [88, 90] . To define what an enhancer was across multiple tissue types, we used the criterion that each cell type needed to have high-quality ChIP-seq data for H3K27Ac and H3K4me1. The H3K27Ac peaks in each cell type were then filtered to include only those that had > 50% overlap with H3K4me1 peaks in the same cell type.",

Therefore, to explore the similarities and differences between these tissues, we wanted to determine if the transcriptional conetwork of TFs associated with FOXA1 was common to both or if instead, FOXA1 transcriptional networks varied between these tissues. To do so, we evaluated motif enrichment within 50 bp of FOXA1 predicted sites in primary human mammary epithelial cell (HMEC) enhancers, repeating the process that was undertaken in Fig. 3A . In total, 45% of AEC enhancer regions overlapped with HMEC enhancers, suggesting that although HMECs were the most closely related cell type studied, there was still considerable variation between their epigenetic states. 53% of all enhancer peaks in HMECs contained the predicted FOXA1 binding motif. Motif enrichment analysis was then re-run on the 100 bp surrounding the predicted FOXA1 binding sites in HMEC enhancers. Because enhancer regions were selected based on the presence of FOXA1, FOX family motifs with similar sequence to FOXA1 were eliminated from the subsequent analysis. A three-dimensional scatter diagram of enrichment measurements for all available TFBS motifs in AT2, AT1-like, and HMEC enhancer regions was performed to visualize similarities and differences between these three cell types (Fig. 6B) . Enrichment for FOS/JUN (AP-1) motifs was observed in proximity to FOXA1 in all three tested cell types (grey circle), indicating that partnering between FOXA1 and FOS/JUN factors may play a conserved role in epithelial cell types. A separate cluster of TFBS motifs enriched in AT1-like cells and HMECs also emerged (blue circle), which included PIT1, POU2F3, and NF1. NF1 is a known binding partner of FOXA1, whereas POU2F3 and PIT1 are involved in cellular fate determination. This could be reflective of the role these factors play in cellular differentiation [92] [93] [94] . Lastly, a separate cluster of TFBS enriched in AT2 and AT1-like cells but not HMECs was observed (green circle). This included NKX2-1, a known lung-specific lineage factor that is critical for lung specification, as well as TEAD family members and MEF2C. Therefore, we have identified a high confidence set of transcription factors that appear to act in concert to coordinate AEC differentiation in vitro and distinguish between lung and breast enhancer identity.",

The considerable variation in enhancer location across all tissues present in ROADMAP/ENCODE and the observation that enhancer regions best recapitulated the epigenetic signature of differentiating AECs gave rise to the idea that we could utilize publicly available datasets on enhancer locations to define AEC cell-specific enhancer signatures for both AT2 and AT1-like cells. To do so, the entire complement of ROADMAP [90] and EN-CODE [88] enhancers for the 82 normal cell types across many organ types was merged to create one master list containing all regions within the human genome identified as enhancers, which we will refer to as the \"enhance-ome\". Cancer-derived enhancer signatures were omitted due to their potential perturbation by the carcinogenic process. The locations of AT2 and AT1-like cell enhancer regions were then compared to the enhance-ome. AECs had 41,145 active enhancers at 9% of all identified normal enhance-ome regions (Fig. 6C) . Of those 41,145 sites in AECs, 92% were also considered enhancers in ROADMAP and ENCODE data sets, providing us with a high level of confidence that our AECdefined enhancers were consistent with observations from other sources. Within the enhancers present in AEC but not in ROADMAP or ENCODE, 295 enhancer regions were active in both AT2 and AT1-like cells (termed AEC), 1277 enhancer regions were only active in AT2 cells (ie., not present in AT1-like, ROADMAP or ENCODE), and 1706 enhancer regions were only present in AT1-like cells.",

H3K27Ac peak enrichment was centered similarly between Donor 1 and Donor 2 in both AT2 and AT1-like samples (Fig. 6D) ; however, the overall enrichment was lower for the biological replicate from Donor 2. Subsetting the AT2 cell-specific and AT1like cell-specific peaks from Donor 1 to overlap with peaks called from Donor 2 resulted in identification of 145 AT2 cell-specific and 92 AT1-like cell-specific high-confidence enhancers (Fig. 6E ). In addition, we also sought to characterize associations between enhancers and target gene expression, often called \"enhancer-gene pairs\". To do so, we utilized both nearest-neighbor (Fig. S8A) , and GTEx-annotated SNP-gene associations where SNPs were located within enhancers (Fig. S8B) . Nearest-neighbor analysis included all AT2 and AT1-like enhancers and loss or gain of a nearby enhancer trended toward respective changes in nearby gene expression, though many exceptions existed. In contrast, GTEx-associated enhancer-gene pairs were limited by the necessity of having a SNP located within the enhancer. Of the 145 AT2 cell-specific enhancers, 61 (42%) had SNPs located within them. Of the 92 AT1 cell-like specific enhancers, 77 (84%) had SNPs located within them and several had multiple SNPs per peak. GTEx recognized 69% of AT2 cell enhancer regions containing rsIDs and 76% of AT1-like cell enhancer region containing rsIDs. Of those, 16 SNPs in AT2 cells and 125 SNPs in AT1-like cells were significantly correlated with alterations in gene expression for at least one gene in lung tissue. Again, multiple SNPs within the same or nearby enhancer regions were functionally linked to the same gene or multiple genes; therefore, we identified 19 AT2 cell specific enhancer-gene pairs and 54 AT1-like enhancer-gene pairs utilizing GTEX, for a total of 73 AEC enhancer-gene pairs (Supplemental Table 2 ). In general, most enhancergene pairs based on GTEx SNPs did not show changes in gene expression during AEC differentiation ( Figure S8B ). Only 19 genes from the GTEX enhancer-gene pair analysis had significantly altered expression during AEC differentiation with log2 fold changes in gene expression that matched the direction of enhancer activity (Supplemental Table 3 ). Ranking the enhancer-gene pairs that occurred using both methods, the top enhancer-gene pair in AT2 cells was at the surfactant protein A1 (SFTPA1) locus, a known AT2 cell-specific gene ( Figure S9, left) . The top AT1-like cell type specific enhancer identified was linked to aminoadipic semialdehyde synthase (AASS), which catalyzes lysine degradation. Lysine is an essential amino acid required for protein production and synthesis in lung is thought to be downregulated to confer partial resistance to viral infections [95] . Since AT1 cells comprise the majority of the epithelial surface, they likely play an important role in viral immunity.",

To address this, we analyzed the distribution of TFBS motifs within the AT2 and AT1-like cell-type specific enhancers and found that all of the AT1-like cell-type specific enhancers had motifs for at least one of the TFs that were identified as associated with FOXA1 in AT1-like cells. The majority of AT1-like cell-specific enhancers had predicted motifs for all three TFs: FOXA1, NKX2-1, and MEF2C (Fig. 7A) . Many of the AT1-like cell-specific enhancers had predicted motif distributions consistent with the TF spacing we observed previously, consistent with what is known about the interaction of these TFs in the literature (Fig. 7B) . To determine the relationship between FOXA1 and NKX2-1 positioning in AT1-like cell type-specific enhancers, relative FOXA1 and NKX2-1 ChIP-seq tag density enrichment was plotted across the 92 AT1-like cell-specific enhancers from the publicly available A549 datasets (Fig. 7C) . We observed that staggered spacing between FOXA1 and NKX2-1 peak summits offset was larger in the ChIP-seq data than from motif prediction (190 bp in ChIP-seq vs 40 bp in motif prediction), which may be due to a loss of resolution in the ChIP-seq due to fragmentation size of the ChIP libraries. To determine if expression levels may in part explain the presence of these factors at AT1-specific enhancer sites, we plotted RNAseq reads for each of the three identified TFs that were enriched in AT1-like (D6) enhancer peaks, FOXA1, NKX2-1 and MEF2C, as a function of time (Fig. 6D) . We observed that, while FOXA1 and NKX2-1 are expressed in AT2 (D0) cells, their expression increases dramatically during 2D AEC differentiation (Fig. 7D) . MEF2C expression in AT2 cells is negligible, and similarly increases expression throughout days in culture. Indeed, relatively higher levels of NKX2-1 have been observed previously in AT1 cells vs. AT2 cells in the IPF Cell Atlas (Fig. S10,  97) . Previous studies in mice have also established a critical role for NKX2-1 in maintenance of AT1 cell fate [37, 96] . Our results suggest the association of FOXA1, NKX2-1, and MEF2C may act in a cooperative heterotrimeric TF complex which binds to AT1-like enhancers as part of a coordinated effort to differentiate the alveolar epithelium, which is reflected in concomitant alterations to the epigenetic state to mediate cellular fate determination. While this heterotrimeric complex may be important for AEC differentiation, it is but one of many interactions that occur among over a dozen families of transcription factors to facilitate this process.",

We found that the enhancer-associated epigenetic signatures of FAIRE open regions, H3K27Ac and H3K4me1 peaks were most closely associated with changes in gene expression during AEC differentiation. Exploring this linkage further, we found that the composition of predicted TFBS motifs changed dramatically during in vitro AT2 to AT1-like cell differentiation, with some TFs (e.g., FOS, ETS1, and NKFB1) enriched in AT2 cell maintenance losing expression and simultaneously having decreased predicted binding to enhancer regions in AT1-like cells. In addition to TEAD family members [13, 72] , we also found that others, including MEF2C, increased in expression and had corresponding increases in predicted TF binding when transitioning to an AT1-like cell fate. In contrast, there were several TFs (e.g., SNAIL, TWIST, GLI family members, and several but not all ZNF family members) whose predicted binding did not appreciably change in either FAIRE open regions or enhancers during differentiation.",

This may be accomplished by switching TF heterotrimeric complex members during differentiation, as we observed differential enrichment for FRA1/FOSL1 and MEF2C in AT2 and AT1-like cells, respectively. This heterotrimeric complex member switching could facilitate alternate enhancer target localization or alter the function of the complex. Interestingly, the previously reported NKX2-1:FOXA1 interaction at the SFTPC promoter was deemed inhibitory, turning off SFTPC expression in AT2 cells [82] , whereas we observe these predicted interactions in regions bearing epigenetic marks characteristic of \"active enhancers\" associated with transcriptional activation. Additionally, it has been previously reported that loss of NKX2-1 can direct the FOXA1/FOXA2 TF axis to alter cell fate from lung to stomach phenotypes [97] , specifically for AT1 cells [37] . Our analysis provides a basis for connecting these disparate lines of evidence: namely, that beyond the known role of NKX2-1 in establishment of the lung endodermal lineage from thyroid [98, 99] , and the role of FOXA1 in lung branching morphogenesis [67] , the FOXA1:NKX2-1 interaction may be pivotal in regulation of epigenomic fate during AEC differentiation.",

These findings are consistent with several recent publications in both mouse and human indicating a role for YAP signaling in driving AEC differentiation [13, 72] . However, our results indicate that the interactions that determine cell fate during AEC differentiation are likely more complex than a single TF or TF interaction, and rather involve a shift in an entire network of TFs and enhancer activation in AT2 vs AT1 cells.",

In contrast, enrichment for FRA1/FOSL1 was observed at + 20 bp downstream of the FOXA1 motif. Therefore, FRA1/FOSL1 interaction with FOXA1 may play a critical role in multiple organs. Follow-up work in mouse models will be important to determine if conditional knockout of FRA1/FOSL1 is able to recapitulate the deleterious effects on branching morphogenesis seen in FOXA1/FOXA2 double knockout mice [67] .",

Throughout the paper, we refer to specific TFBS as enriched based on HOMER motif predictions; however, in the absence of confirmatory ChIP-seq (DNA occupancy) and RNA-seq (expression) data, these motifs could be bound by any one or multiple TF family members with similar DNA binding preferences. For example, the FOXA motif is nearly identical for all three FOXA family members (FOXA1, FOXA2, and FOXA3), limiting occupancy predictions based purely on motif enrichment to a family of related TFs rather than implicating a specific TF. Complicating the interpretation of FOXA motif enrichment is their known compensatory roles in branching morphogenesis of the lung and alveolar epithelial differentiation [67] . Another is the known role of Etv5 in AT2 cell fate maintenance [66] . Etv5 is a member of the ETS family of TFs, and while there is no specific entry for Etv5 in HOMER, the high levels of enrichment for ETS family members during AEC differentiation and their shared TFBS recognition is consistent with the known role of this ETS family member in alveolar fate determination.",

These epigenetic signatures are being made publicly available to further understanding of the alveolar epithelial cell differentiation process with particular emphasis on how epigenetic signatures dictate the coordinated pathways that result in altered cellular fate [7, 35] . AEC differentiation in vitro from purified adult human, rat, and mouse AT2 cells is considered a model of wound healing [100, 101] , as adult AT1 cells must be replenished after exposure to and damage from a slew of particulate and chemical insults present in the air we breathe [102] . The ability of the TFs we have identified to facilitate this process may be affected by these environmental insults, leading to disrupted AEC differentiation and wound healing. This can in turn manifest as diseases of the distal alveolar epithelium, such as IPF, COPD, and lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). Importantly, many of the transcription factors we have identified in this study have known roles in these disease processes. Specifically, FOXA1 plays a significant role in non-small cell lung cancer [103] , MEF2 family members have a role in lung carcinoma [104, 105] , TEAD family members have known roles in carcinogenesis of epithelial tissues [106] , and NKX2-1 has a long history of involvement in lung cancer, COPD and IPF [87, [107] [108] [109] [110] . Understanding the relationship between disruption of the epigenetic state during AEC differentiation and the development of lung diseases could open up an entirely new avenue of therapeutic options for these often-fatal diseases.",

Lungs were processed within 3 days of death. AT2 cells were isolated from cadaveric human lungs that were declined for donor transplantation. Donor 1 was a 62-year-old Caucasian male. Donor 2 was a 25-year-old Caucasian male. Donor 3 (used for RNA only) was a 73-year-old Caucasian female. None of the donors died from lungrelated injury or complications. We selected the lobe of the lung that had no obvious consolidation or hemorrhage by gross inspection. The lung tissue processing protocol was modified from previously published reports [8, 111] with the following modifications: Enhanced selection of epithelial cells was performed by using CD326 (EpCAM) beads (Miltenyi Biotec #130-061-101) and rotating the cells for 10 min at 4\u00b0C followed by 20 min at RT. Cells were collected by magnetic selection using LS columns (Miltenyi Biotec #130-042-401). AT2 cell purity was determined by staining of cytospin preparation with NKX2-1 (1:100, Leica Biosystems, Cat # NCL-1-TTF1). Donor 1 was 83% positive, Donor 2 was 96% positive, and Donor 3 was 79% positive, however, not enough cells were collected for chromatin profiling of this third lung, so the sample was used for RNA-seq only. For harvesting chromatin, AT2 cells were plated at 4 \u00d7 10 6 cells per well in 6-well Corning plates (Primaria) and incubated at 37\u00b0C in 50:50 DMEM high glucose: DME-F12 media supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). For harvesting of DNA and RNA, AT2 cells were seeded on collagencoated transwell-COL inserts (Corning, #3493) at a density of 1 \u00d7 10 6 /filter. 1 million cells were used for DNA and RNA extraction, 2-5 million cells were used for chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP-seq) of histone marks, and 10 million cells were used for CTCF ChIP-seq.",

Briefly, total cell RNA was DNase I digested and then subjected to ribosomal RNA depletion with the Ribominus\u2122 Eukaryote v2 kit (Life Technologies, # A15020, Grand Island, NY). Libraries were constructed with the TruSeq RNA Sample Prep Kit v2 (Illumina # RS- and underwent Illumina HiSeq 2000 pairedend sequencing (2 \u00d7 50 bp) according to the manufacturer's instructions as previously reported [59, 112] . Resultant 50 bp paired end FASTQ files were trimmed to remove adapters and realigned to the hg19 genome using Bowtie 2 [113] . Mapped reads were then assembled into transcripts using TopHat v2.0.12 [114] . Resultant reads per kilobase of gene per millions mapped (RPKMs) were used for downstream analysis. Statistical analysis of differential gene expression and correction for covariates including patient sex was performed in DESeq2 [115] , and genes located on either the X of Y chromosome were removed due to sex-specific effects on those genes. For whole genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS), DNA was isolated and library preparation was performed at the USC Epigenome Core. In brief, libraries were plated using the Illumina cBot and run on the Hi-Seq 2000 according to manufacturer's instructions using HSCS v 1.5.15.1. Bisulfite-treated DNA underwent Paired End 100 cycling. Image analysis and base calling were carried out using RTA 1.13.48.0. Deconvolution and fastq file generation was carried out using CASAVA_v1.7.1a5. Alignment to the genome was carried out using bsmap V 2.5 [116] . Aligned .bam files were visualized using IGViewer V2.3.40 (Broad Institute, Cambridge MA). Reads were then aligned to the hg19 bisulfite genome and CpG methylation levels and SNPs were determined genome-wide using BisSNP [117] . Methylation domains for each time point during differentiation were calculated using MethylSeekR [16] .",

Human GRAMD2 enhancer primer sequence: Forward 5\u2032-GGTCTCCTGATTTC CTGATG \u2212 3\u2032, Reverse 5\u2032-AGGCTGACTTCTCACT ATTC-3\u2032.

ROADMAP peaks were previously called using MACS v2.0 [125, 126] . Overlapping H3K27Ac and H3K4me1 regions for each cell type were defined as H3K27Ac peaks with > 50% overlap with H3K4me1. Individual cell type enhancers were then merged into one large enhancer dataset for all cell types (i.e., the \"enhance-ome\"). ROADMAP lung organ data was the only tissue excluded from analysis because AEC are part of the lung. AEC peak calling was performed again using MACS v2.0 for consistency with Roadmap and ENCODE, with a pvalue cut off for detection of 1e-3. AEC input DNA was used as background with local bias correction of 5 K and 10 K in the cell type data included. Differential occupancy of AEC enhancer peaks was determined using the UCSC table browser [127] . Peak height was calculated using the area under the curve between the background level and maximal enrichment point along the curve.",

Bigwig files of RNA-seq and ChIP-seq data from AEC cells are shown, along with regions called peaks directly below the bigwig track. Two regions were identified within the locus as AT1-like cell type specific enhancers. Roadmap (76 samples) and encode (6 samples) peaks were condensed into bed files and merged to create one master enhancer track for non-AEC cell types (presence or absence at any given base).

E) Supervised clustering analysis of gene expression changes for the indicated transcription factors during AEC differentiation. Purple = high expression, green = low expression, each column color scaled by standard deviation within the row.
