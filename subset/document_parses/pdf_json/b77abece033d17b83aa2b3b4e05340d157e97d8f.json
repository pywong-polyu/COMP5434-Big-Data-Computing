However, the results from several clinical trials assessing the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine in COVID-19 failed to reach a consistent conclusion [1, [3] [4] [5] . The use of hydroxychloroquine in rheumatic disease was not exactly the same with its use in these trials in terms of duration, doses, and patient immune status. There have been no studies reporting the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine in COVID-19 in rheumatic patients. Here, we report a family cluster of SARS-CoV-2 infections that occurred in January 2020. In this family of five, three adult members successively developed respiratory symptoms and later tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, while the other two members, both of whom were taking hydroxychloroquine and leflunomide for the treatment of RA, showed no signs of infection during the observation period (February 1st to March 7th, 2020). One week after the family dinner for the celebration of this traditional Chinese festival, fatigue escalated in P1 and symptoms of cough, mild dyspnea, and low-grade fever appeared. Leukocytopenia was observed, and SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in throat swab samples collected from P1 on February 13th, 2020 (Figure 1(B) ). After admission to a mobile cabin hospital designated for the treatment of mild to moderate COVID-19 patients, multiple ground glass opacities (GGO) in both lower lobes were observed on her chest computed tomography (CT). By the end of January 2020, symptoms of viral pneumonia, including cough and low-grade fever, appeared in the son (P4) and daughter-inlaw (P5) of P1. Subsequent laboratory tests of SARS-CoV-2 RNA and chest CT confirmed their infection with this dangerous virus (Figure 1 (B)).",

            "text": "Chloroquine is able to interfere with terminal glycosylation of ACE2, the entry receptor of SARS-CoV-2 [9, 15] . In addition, it increases endosomal pH required for virus/cell fusion. In in vitro cell culture system, both hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine have shown a potent anti-viral activity on SARS-CoV-2 [1, 2] . Recently, in a randomized trial involving 22 COVID-19 patients, Gautret et al. reported that hydroxychloroquine accelerated the clearance of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA [3] . It is noteworthy that hydroxychloroquine was administered as a treatment after the onset of COVID-19 in this study. Whether preventive use of hydroxychloroquine could provide protection on SARS-CoV-2 infection remains elusive. Leflunomide has shown anti-viral effects in patients infected with CMV [16] and transplant recipients with BK virus [17] and HPV virus [18] . However, leflunomide has been associated with increased interstitial lung disease, especially in those with prior methotrexate use and pre-existing interstitial lung disease [19] . Therefore, the potential benefits of leflunomide in COVID-19 pneumonia have not been reported and remain questionable. Patients with rheumatic disease routinely take immunosupressive anti-rheumatic agents to control the disease progression and thus usually are immunocompromised and susceptible to infection. Given the preliminary evidence shown in the in vitro and pilot trial [1] [2] [3] , there were a number of randomized controlled clinical trials register to evaluate the safety and efficacy of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine in the treatment of COVID-19. However, the results from the clinical trials currently available failed to reveal a definite answer to the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine in COVID-19 [1, [3] [4] [5] . In these trials, hydroxychloroquine was given at doses of 400-1200 mg/day for 5-14 days. Unlike those trials assessing the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine in COVID-19, patients with rheumatic disease such as RA were taking hydroxychloroquine usually at a low dose for a long time. Higher doses of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine have been shown to have cardiotoxicity in COVID-19 patients [20, 21] . However, hydroxychloroquine, when used alone in patients with RA, was comparable in terms of safety to other DMARD drug such as sulfasalazine [22] . In this report, the two RA patients on regular antirheumatic medication were protected from infection of COVID-19 after daily close contact with P1 who transmitted the virus to all the other adults in the family. Given the same RA disease history and anti-rheumatic treatments, it is possible that one or some of the medications they were taking confer them protection in this family cluster of infection. This is consistent with our recent findings that patients with rheumatic diseases were at a higher risk of COVID-19 infection while preventive use of hydroxychloroquine may reduce this risk in these patients compared to other immunosuppressive DMARDs [23] . A study by Pablos et al. [24] also showed that patients with rheumatic disease on csDMARDs had a lower prevalence of COVID-19 compared to those on targeted synthetic DMARDs, which is possibly due to the frequent use of antimalarials. It is noteworthy that hydroxychloroquine may not alleviate the disease severity once infected with SARS-CoV2, although it may have beneficial effects on COVID-19 susceptibility. Several studies including a recent retrospective observation on 600 patients with rheumatic disease and COVID-19 showed no beneficial effect of antimalarial agents on improving COVID-19 severity once infected [25] . Other possibilities such as the awareness of personal protection against infections should also be considered. For example, patients on immunosuppressive medication may be more cautious about infections and may take extra protections against infections. Further studies on protection against infections in these patients are required to provide direct evidence.",
