Documented barriers in these processes nationwide include unavailable online information (n = 11), restrictions mandating agents to be family members (n = 7), physician affidavits or signatures (n = 9), and notary or witness signature requirements (n = 15).

The confluence of the November 2020 election and COVID-19 emphasized the importance for patient and provider awareness of remote voting mechanisms that may both ensure access to voting for hospitalized voters and ameliorate the viral transmission risks by providing an alternative to in-person voting. However, to the best of our knowledge, there has been no nationwide assessment of emergency absentee voting processes or election changes nationwide due to COVID-19. Consequently, in the present study we aimed to a) profile state-by-state details and national trends in \"emergency absentee processes\" available to hospitalized voters and b) summarize changes in all 50 states' overall voting processes in light of COVID-19.",

For the 39 emergency absentee voting processes nationwide, the emergency absentee period most commonly began within 24 hours following the normal absentee application deadline. Only 28 states had publicly available information on their board of elections website outlining the state's specific protocol. The procedure for obtaining and voting through an emergency absentee ballot entails three steps. First, a hospitalized voter must fill out an initial emergency absentee application. Twenty-five states allow applications to be directly downloaded from the board of elections website, but the remaining states necessitate contacting a local election official to obtain an application. Moreover, nine states mandate a physician signature or affidavit on the application, attesting to the voter's hospitalization (Supplementary Table 2 ). The voter must subsequently return their filledout application to their local election official (Table) . The most common submission method is through an authorized agent (38 states), wherein the voter appoints an \"agent,\" a representative designated for delivering the application in person ( Figure 1E ). Seven states mandate that a voter's agent must be a family member, but anyone, such as a healthcare worker, may serve as an agent in the remaining 31 ( Figure. 2A). Additionally, 29 states do not limit the maximum number of applications a single agent can process ( Figure  2B ). Twenty-five states alternatively allow for applications to be submitted by mail, and 21 states have electronic submission methods such as email, fax, or phone requests. Applications must be returned by a specific deadline, which may fall 24-48 hours earlier than the eventual ballot return deadline (Supplementary Figure A) .",

First, healthcare workers may strive to educate themselves on the specific absentee and hospitalized voting procedures for their statesuch as absentee ballot requirements and deadlines as well as methods of ballot and application delivery, especially given substantial interstate heterogeneity -and counsel interested patients accordingly, particularly those expressing concerns about missing an election due to their hospitalization. Healthcare workers should navigate the topic of voting with their patients akin to obtaining informed consent for a procedure, and they should respect a patient's decision to abstain from voting. Hospitals may also seek to expand patient knowledge by distributing informational flyers and codifying discussions of emergency voting into care encounters, such as social work consultations.",

Hospitals may also target volunteer recruitment toward this specific purpose. Fourth, hospitals may seek to partner directly with their local election body to establish a formalized process for patients to undertake absentee voting, a communication line for any troubleshooting or process updates, and institutional experience across election cycles.

The pandemic also limited the operation of emergency absentee voting in several states. For example, to mitigate risk six states canceled the use of in-person teams but two (Arizona and Rhode Island) reported implementing teams using sworn-in healthcare workers to deliver ballots. It is conceivable that increases in hospitalizations due to COVID-19 increased the utilization of emergency absentee voting processes, but limited data in emergency ballot counts for most states limited analysis of this.
