All western countries have regulated the management sector of this resource (Integrated Water System -SII), regarding both its distribution as well as the purification and collection of sewage waste. Italy has also moved towards privatizing its management, proposing a collaborative mechanism between the public regulatory Authority and the private operator. The investments for the maintenance and development of the asset are therefore supported by the private investors. The model proposed in this work is based on the use of AHP to encourage the conciliation of opposing interests and rationalize a rather complex regulatory phase. It facilitates the selection of technical investment alternatives for the improvement of the SII supply standards.",

This proposal must contain the Intervention Program (PoI) which details the investments that the Operator will have to make within the regulatory four-year period identified by the Authority. This is an instrument with public matrix priority objectives (social, economic and environmental of the community concerned), all borrowed from the PDA (Area plan defined by the EGA) but with careful consideration of the business aims of the Operator, however relevant for the financial sustainability of the management model [9] [10] [11] . While the law attributes the responsibility for the tariff proposal to the EGA, the necessarily concerted scope of the tariff construction process is evident, in a close comparison between the public and private operators. These principles are contained in Authority regulatory directives such as 643/2013/R/idr, 664/2015/R/Idr and 917/2017/R/Idr (Technical Quality Regulation -RQTI). ARERA absorbs the European guidelines within the tariff proposal, requesting, for the analysis of intervention programs, the explicit definition and evaluation of investment alternatives in order to solve the critical issues identified in the area of competence.

ARERA in the Resolution 3/2014-DSID identified 40 critical issues, classified into 7 thematic areas, to which each EGA had to trace the problems encountered in its area of competence. Subsequently, with the Resolution 2/2016-DSID, the classification of the critical issues was more detailed by presenting 8 Areas, 57 Sub-areas and 137 critical issues. The EGA remains, however, free to measure them according to its own performance indicators. In recent years, the Authority, with the Resolution 1/2018-DSID, changed the classification of the critical issues again. The current overall classification structure is shown in Fig. 1 . There are Areas regarding management problems (for example: criticalities referred to the management of the relationship with final users) and others regarding technical problems (for example: problems regarding wastewater treatment). Each Area includes several Sub-Areas and finally, each of the Sub-Areas includes the critical issues. For example, the DIS Area -Critical issues in the distribution includes the Sub-Areas DIS1 -Inadequacy of the distribution infrastructures, DIS2 -Pressure problems, etc. Than, the Sub-Area DIS1 presents the critical issues DIS1.1 -Partial or total absence of the distribution networks, DIS1.2 -Inadequate physical conditions of the networks and distribution systems, etc.",

Firstly, the model outlines an original way of selecting the best project alternatives a Mi to solve the problems of the Service. Second, the model allows to identify project alternatives that may have relevance for more than one criticalities, thus rewarding multi-objective technical solutions. Moreover, it introduces three new criteria, as compared to those proposed by the national Authority, able to define the economic and financial range of the project solutions. The third reason is that the model configures a final hierarchical rout of the interventions selected a Mi , with respect to the needs set out by the EGA in the PDA, capable of guiding the negotiation between the EGA and the Operator currently compulsory between the community interests and business objectives. Among the a Mi defined to resolve the various c i , some are more oriented in favour of the public operator, while others in favour of the private one. It is obvious that each Operator tends to privilege the investment in those segments (for example, water compared to sewerage) or in those activities (for example, the reduction of losses due to populous agglomerations compared to the construction of a new network branch useful for a small urban fraction) which have a higher and more immediate financial profitability [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] . Figure 2 show the logic of the first and second objectives of the hypothesized model. The third goal of the model is incorporated in the implementation of the first two ones. It can be useful to independently represent it, because in the current legislation, there is no reference to similar temporal hierarchization of the interventions to be executed in the PoI. So, this step is completely original with respect to legal indications. However, this study does not explicitly take this into account, postponing it for a later study.",
