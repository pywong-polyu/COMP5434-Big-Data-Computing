The three referral hospitals are located in geographically strategic locations in the west, east and the central regions. Specific COVID-19 management hospitals are designated across the country while the majority of the confirmed cases were treated at the Jigme Dorji Wangchuck National Referral Hospital, Thimphu [1] .",

As of 2019, there were approximately 180 Bhutanese medical students in Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and India [3] . These students are fully or partially funded by the Royal Government while some are privately funded. The duration of undergraduate medical training is five years in Sri Lanka and four years in Bangladesh and India, followed by one-year internship programme.

With clinical rotations cancelled, online teaching-learning modules were rapidly adopted in many colleges and has been particularly useful to international students who returned to their home countries [4, 5] . The pandemic situation has brought significant changes to medical education including their transition from students to doctors [6, 7] . While some regulatory bodies have called for early graduation and registration of medical students for meaningful participation in the present pandemic, others have cautioned against taking up roles beyond their competence [8, 9, 10] . In Italy, at the height of health crisis when the health system was overwhelmed, medical students were fast tracked and recruited as doctors [11] . The urgency to recruit young health workers in the ongoing pandemic is also due to higher complication rates and mortality reported among older healthcare workers [10, 11] . This has led to a tension between safeguarding education and responding to the demands on health service [7] . In countries where there are shortages of health human resources, medical students have been employed in various capacities in response to the pandemic.",

It has been suggested that in places where there are acute shortages, medical students may be tasked with care of routine patients to free the other health workers for COVID-19 management [10, 11] . In our study, the students could not identify whether they should shoulder clinical job responsibilities or take on communications and advocacy work and only 13% believed that they can make meaningful contributions. In a study in Turkey, a quarter of the students (24.3%) reported that they are not competent to handle clinical responsibilities whereas others reported that they would be happy to work in the emergency department [16] . The engagement of medical students in healthcare settings is advisable only after a thorough assessment of student's readiness and the severity of needs and shortages in the health system. It is suggested that medical students can assist with routine outpatient clinical care, care of chronic patients and routine antenatal checks of pregnant women. Many of these tasks can be performed via telemedicine and involves no risk of infectious transmissions. Medical students in advanced stages of training may be engaged in inpatient care.",

The proportion of medical students who had received training on the use of personal protective equipment was very low: 4% in our study, and 7% among final year students in Turkey [16] . If the government were to engage medical students in clinical settings, proper inductions, training on the infection control measures and the use of PPEs and clear guidance on working within their competencies are required [7, 22] . It is suggested that medical students be given targeted volunteering opportunities that supplement their educational needs and specific learning objectives [7] . Experience from Denmark shows that after adequate training on infection control and emphasis on the role of medical students in the pandemic emergency healthcare workforce, two thirds of students had volunteered to work in pandemic emergency departments [22] .
