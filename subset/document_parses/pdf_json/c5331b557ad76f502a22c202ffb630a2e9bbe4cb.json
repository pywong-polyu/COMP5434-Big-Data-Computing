Based on our study of an emergency department that was disrupted by the threat of the Ebola virus in 2014, we develop a process model to explain how a place of social inclusion can be maintained by custodians. We show how these custodians-in our fieldsite, doctors and nurses-experience and engage in institutional work to manage different levels of tension between the value of inclusion and the reality of finite resources, as well as tension between inclusion and the desire for safety. We also demonstrate how the interplay of custodians' emotions is integral to maintaining the place of social inclusion. The primary contribution of our study is to shine light on places of social inclusion as important institutions in democratic society.

At the local level, the accessibility of any particular site that is a place of social inclusion-for example, a local emergency department or public school-may be affected by factors such as population growth, income inequalities, natural disasters, and social ills like poverty, illiteracy, homelessness, and poor physical and mental health. Gun shootings occur in local schools, terrorists attack citizens in public open places, crime and violence assail neighborhoods, and pandemics and infectious diseases spread across national borders and within local communities, as the 2020 pandemic of coronavirus disease showed while we were finalizing this research.

While institutional scholars have rarely postulated meaningful relationships between places and institutions (see Lawrence and Dover, 2015 , for an exception), Scott's (2014) definition implies that a place should be conceptualized as an institution. A place is regulated by laws, rules, and codes of conduct that seek to control and order how people interact with and in that place. A place is supported normatively by values and beliefs that define what inhabitants should strive to attain and how. Finally, a place will evoke shared meanings and ''a way of seeing, knowing and understanding the world'' that is cognitively and affectively accepted by people who inhabit that place (Cresswell, 2014: 11) .

As one doctor put it, ''The public hospital ED is the ultimate environment . . .

For Australian people in marginalized and vulnerable groups-such as the homeless, mentally ill, drug or alcohol addicted, and socially disadvantaged-the public ED is often ''the one place where these guys can get looked after'' (D31). Public EDs in Australia ''are the safety net for vulnerable people . . . whatever's going on [in society] we become that place'' (D21). At the same time, there is broad recognition that public EDs provide care that is not only socially inclusive but of high quality.

As a local place of social inclusion, the ED is expected to be ''the saving place for so many people who come [here to make claims] for all sorts of reasons'' (D1). Yet the data indicate that the combination of societal institution and local place has consequences that make this accomplishment difficult. The ED is geographically and materially bounded because the government has assembled a finite stock of resourcesstaffing, beds, equipment, diagnostic technologies, and other supplies-at the local place to respond to citizens' claims. This creates a tension between the institutional value of inclusion and local resources. A nurse described this value tension: ''Everyone is entitled to health care, but you've only got this much resource and you've got this [gestures with hands to indicate volume of people presenting to the local ED]-how do you match them?'' (N6). A second value tension concerns local safety. At the societal level, the ED as a place of social inclusion ''should at least be a safe place to come'' (fieldnotes).

A radiologist suggests using a contrast dye with the CT scan, but this means P will need a bed for longer, and Dr S is not convinced the dye is medically warranted. After the scan, Dr S moves P to the ED's short stay unit for 24 hours with a plan that if the vomiting and pain settle down, P will be discharged and given a follow-up appointment with a hospital outpatient clinic. If symptoms persist, P will be reviewed by surgeons for an operation. (Fieldnotes) This example illustrates how custodian work occurs through resource rationing. The doctor and nurse evaluate the basis for the claim as an immediate health need. Perceiving that the ED has adequate resources to resolve this need, they experience low tension between the institutional value of social inclusion and the local ED's finite resources. They allocate appropriate, but not excessive, resources and emotional energy to meet the need underlying the claim (staff time and expertise, investigation, equipment, 24-hour bed, empathy), which maximizes the ED's ability to respond to other claims. Had this been a pay-for-service private ED rather than a place of social inclusion, the doctor would not have had to think about how ''ordering a CT scan may delay another CT scan for another patient-you have a different [responsibility]'' (D44). A doctor who worked in both the fieldsite ED and a private ED explained, ''I will make different decisions on what I do in the public sector and private sector because I know there is different access and availability in the . . . resources'' (D34). Table 2 presents examples of these microprocesses in which custodians apprehend a claim as an immediate or recurrent health need, experience low tension between social inclusion and finite resources, and meet the need by rationing resources. Examples of claims for immediate needs included new symptoms that a person was experiencing such as back pain, acute exacerbations of pre-existing conditions such as diabetes, and diagnostic puzzles such as multiple sclerosis. Claims for recurrent needs involved the repetition of a past illness or behavior, such as unchanged chronic illness or frequent attendance for non-emergency claims. Doctors and nurses responded to claims for recurrent needs by allocating ''the bare minimum'' (D20) resources because they were ''obliged to sort out [the claim] enough to allow the patient to go home in some sort of safe and dignified manner'' (D22).

Participants reflected that resource-rationing work is ''a different reality'' (D33) for medical and nursing professionals employed in a public ED because no other place of medicine in Australia has responsibility for accomplishing the value of universal accessibility to medical care. That is, Australian citizens ''know that the emergency department never shuts and know that the ED is never going to turn us away'' (D21).

Our analysis revealed that not all claims on the ED's finite resources could be addressed adequately by custodians performing resource-rationing work. Sometimes custodians made judgments that a claimant's needs extended beyond an immediate or recurrent health problem to future-oriented needs, as vulnerable people presented to the ED seeking support to change their life circumstances. When responding to these claims as custodians, doctors and nurses experienced a high level of tension between the institutional value of social inclusion and the ED's finite resources as a local Uses minimum resources if patient is safe to leave: ''We're not going to hold them here against their will unless there is reason to, i.e., they're a threat of harming themselves or others.''

A team of six people-Dr S, a junior doctor, social workers, and community services-spend the entire day organizing a hospital admission, home support, and removal of driver's license. For the two ED doctors, the intervention to keep ''the most extraordinary complicated social circumstance from advancing to complete disaster'' dominates everything else going on in the ED, where other doctors and nurses work as best they can to cover for their absence. Dr S, who stays to resolve some issues for an extra two hours after the end of shift, describes how P's family ''went home just sobbing because someone had made an effort to try and sort it out.'' Emphasizing ''the emergency department was a great site for it to happen,'' Dr S adds, ''But it took a huge amount of work. That's a lot of health resource.'' Dr S tells the junior doctor, ''That's probably the greatest intervention you'll achieve as a junior in an emergency department. Much more so than fixing a broken arm. . . . This is far more important to have achieved.'' (Fieldnotes, D20) This example illustrates the microprocesses through which custodians reconcile a high level of tension between the institutional value of social inclusion and local resources. The senior doctor judged the basis for the person's claim as a need involving social justice and human welfare. This need aroused intense moral emotions, with the doctor deeply concerned for the patient and family and motivated to activate extraordinary resources to accomplish the highest values of the ED as a place of social inclusion. Rather than the ED's finite supply of resources constraining the claim response, the doctor instead enacted his role as custodian by interpreting local resources (bed, staff time, social workers' knowledge, community services) as enablers of a more enduring intervention for the family's welfare. Table 3 presents other examples of custodians evaluating claims as human needs that exceed ordinary resource allocations, experiencing high tension between inclusion and resources, feeling intense moral emotions, and activating resources as enablers. Examples include claims by victims of domestic violence and by other vulnerable people judged to be in crisis and in need of ''community services to help support them'' (N12). Claims can also trigger resource-enabling responses when custodians judge a person with an addiction as sincerely wanting help to ''change in their trajectory'' (D3). Finally, claims for end-of-life care prompt resource enabling when the ED provides extraordinary resources to honor human dignity at the end of life. For custodians, the human needs underpinning these types of claims arouse intense moral emotions of empathic concern: ''If you're not upset by grief . . . or a tragic story, you need to go and get another job'' (N1). Some claims aroused moral emotions of such intensity that ''there are ones that will live with me forever'' (D8). Our data suggest that these processes of resource-enabling work are distinctive to custodianship of public EDs. Reflecting on their experiences being employed in both public and private EDs, several research participants explained that there is no ''na\u00efve separation'' (D16) between acute medicine and social disadvantage in the fieldsite ED, as opposed to in a private ED. Some participants asserted that other specialist departments in the public hospital could also separate social disadvantage from medicine to some extent because the ED provided a buffer as ''the first port of call'' (R3, R4) between community and hospital. Resource-enabling work allowed custodians to uphold the highest ideals of a public ED as a place of social inclusion for the most needy citizens: ''rightly, the community should expect more from us'' (D37). While it was easier for custodians to allocate more resources to these types of claims when the ED was not overloaded, custodians tried to keep focused on ''making the right decision [about the person's resource needs] each time . . . even if the place is heaving'' (D39). As our field observations demonstrate, if resource-enabling work is ''the best we can do [for a person's needs], we run around like crazy trying to achieve that'' (N23).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1183, "end": 1195, "text": "(Fieldnotes,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1196, "end": 1200, "text": "D20)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 2013, "end": 2020, "text": "Table 3", "ref_id": "TABREF4"}], "section": "Local Resources and Maintaining the Place of Social Inclusion"}, {"text": "Place disruption.

Second, they managed the inclusion-resource tension at the local place by ensuring that the ED remained open. Because ''the reality is we don't really have a lot of control about who comes through or how many people come through the front doors'' (R7), there is potential for the volume of claims to completely overwhelm the ED resources available at the local place.

Our participants pointed out that compared with private fee-forservice EDs, public EDs had responsibilities for a wider ''spectrum of humanity . . . [so] there's a significant risk'' (D2).

Persons making claims could act violently due to physiological (e.g., dementia, brain injury), psychological (e.g., mental illness), toxicological (e.g., alcohol abuse, drug overdose), or behavioral causes.

Risk mitigation mechanisms included security guards, verbal de-escalation, security cameras, and patient isolation and sedation. Because violence was a known risk, doctors and nurses reported being able to manage their fear of harm to the extent that they could respond inclusively to claims. Our fieldnotes show, for example, nurses being shaken up after being verbally abused by a patient but continuing to administer care, and doctors examining angry drunk people even though ''they look ready to take a swing at me'' [fieldnotes] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 961, "end": 973, "text": "[fieldnotes]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Safety and Maintaining the Place of Social Inclusion"}, {"text": "Another threat of harm that custodians classified as a known risk was associated with infection. Persons with blood-borne viruses (e.g., hepatitis C, human immunodeficiency virus/HIV) and diseases transmitted via droplets (e.g., influenza, whooping cough) and/or airborne routes (e.g., measles, tuberculosis) posed the highest risk of infection for doctors and nurses. Custodians classified infectious diseases that had a well-understood and familiar disease process as known risks. For example, doctors and nurses ''understand the flu a bit more and have had experience with it'' (D16), occasionally treat cases of measles and tuberculosis (fieldnotes), and ''could get a needle stick every day from a HIV patient or a hep-C patient . . . we've got used to those risks'' (D11). Familiar infectious diseases had evidence-based risk mitigation procedures that doctors and nurses trusted, such as infection control precautions, personal protective equipment, warning signs, quarantines, and staff immunization. Because they ''knew how to deal with infectious diseases that came to the front door'' (D4), custodians could resolve the inclusion-safety tension when responding to claims: If these patients come here seeking help, you see them and you assess them properly [while mitigating the known risk of harm], and then you make sure that they're okay and you activate the resources needed for them. . . . I'm nervous about it when you walk in to see someone who's angry and snarling and spitting, where you've got a much greater risk of actually getting a transmissible disease. But you do what you have to do. . . . Are you going to refuse to see them because your chance of getting harmed is much higher? Of course not. (D13) As the example above illustrates, when doctors and nurses classify a person making a claim as a known risk, they perceive tension between the safety of the local place and social inclusion. Despite feeling ''slightly excited and scared about what's coming up'' (N2), they are able to manage their fear sufficiently to perform their role as custodians by mitigating risk and then activating resources to meet the human need underlying the claim. The above example also illuminates how managing fear is bolstered by custodians' moral emotions related to a sense of concern for doing the ''right thing'' to meet the needs of the patient and society more broadly. A nurse, who had recently been cut with a knife when responding to a claim by a suicidal patient, explained: ''My Achilles heel in those situations is trying to help the patient, so I'll put myself in a bit more danger'' (N24).", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Safety and Maintaining the Place of Social Inclusion"}, {"text": "In one compelling example from our fieldnotes, we observed an elderly dementia patient punch a nurse in the face, sparking fear among the ED team responding to the claim and triggering a self-protective instinct to withdraw access.

Our fieldnotes show that moral emotions associated with not wanting to violate their custodian responsibilities to the community (''the nursing home can't cope'') and empathy for the patient (''it's quite sad'') helped subdue fear. The treating team resolved the inclusion-safety tension by mitigating the known risk through sedation, which allowed them to safely keep the patient in the ED overnight until specialist services could provide support the next day. Table 4 presents other examples in which custodians classify a claim as a known risk, experience low inclusion-safety tension and manageable fear, and are motivated to take action by mitigating the harm and then rationing or enabling resources to meet the person's need.

After the World Health Organization (WHO) in 2014 warned of the threat of a pandemic through international travel of persons who had lived in or visited Ebola-infected regions, the public hospital where we collected our data was designated by the government as one of Australia's ''Ebola response and treatment hospitals.''

If moral emotions reduce fear to a manageable level, custodians find ways to mitigate harm and protect universal access at the local place, thereby maintaining the institution of a place of social inclusion at the societal level. But if custodians' fear outweighs moral emotions, they feel justified in engaging in harm-avoiding work to protect the safety of the local place.

Our concept of a place of social inclusion is anchored in scholarship about public places of democracy that are accessible to all citizens (Altman and Zube, 1989; Carr et al., 1992) , local places that are geographically bounded, material, and meaningful (Tuan, 1977; Gieryn, 2000) , and societal institutions as nested multi-level systems (Scott, 2014) . Although the possibility that places of social inclusion exist can be inferred from these previous writings, their distinctive characteristics have not been conceptualized and integrated into theoretical understandings of institutions until now. The literature pointed us to the initial definition of a place of social inclusion that we sketched at the beginning of this paper. Our empirical study of a public hospital emergency department now allows us to deepen and elaborate our understanding of the defining societallevel and local-level characteristics of a place of social inclusion as an institution. We contend that places of social inclusion are distinguished as institutions by the following characteristics: (1) establishment at the level of society to accomplish values of social inclusion by providing citizens with universal access to services for essential human needs; and (2) endowment of geographic sites at the local level with material resources, meaning, and values as places where citizens in need can make claims. A consequence of these two defining characteristics is the associated value tensions between universal accessibility and the finite resources and safety of the local place. We suggest that our theoretical model of how these tensions create conditions for custodianship may be generalizable beyond public emergency departments to other places of social inclusion. To illustrate, we offer an example of the model's application to public schools, which are ''pervasive institutions'' in society and local communities (Longhofer, Negro, and Roberts, 2019: 223) . While the ''egalitarian ethos'' of education-for-all exists at the societal level (Domina, Penner, and Penner, 2017: 311) , students live in neighborhoods with particular demographic, economic, and racial characteristics and make claims for access to education at their local public school (Arum, 2000; Longhofer, Negro, and Roberts, 2019) . Principals and teachers in local public schools at times perceive tension between the societallevel value of universal access and the resources available to meet student needs at their particular school, such as classrooms, staff, technology, and equipment (Arum, 2000) . Our model suggests this value tension motivates some of them to act as local custodians by rationing resources to meet students' ordinary needs and enabling resources for vulnerable and/or gifted students. We do not assert that these custodian judgments will always or necessarily accomplish the highest values of social inclusion in terms of social justice and human empowerment. On the contrary, our model contends that whether a student's claim for education at a neighborhood public school elicits resource-rationing work or resource-enabling work depends on the subjective judgments and moral emotions of local custodians.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 369, "end": 392, "text": "(Altman and Zube, 1989;", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 393, "end": 411, "text": "Carr et al., 1992)", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 485, "end": 497, "text": "(Tuan, 1977;", "ref_id": "BIBREF81"}, {"start": 498, "end": 511, "text": "Gieryn, 2000)", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 570, "end": 583, "text": "(Scott, 2014)", "ref_id": "BIBREF71"}, {"start": 2137, "end": 2179, "text": "(Longhofer, Negro, and Roberts, 2019: 223)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2264, "end": 2303, "text": "(Domina, Penner, and Penner, 2017: 311)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2472, "end": 2484, "text": "(Arum, 2000;", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 2485, "end": 2521, "text": "Longhofer, Negro, and Roberts, 2019)", "ref_id": "BIBREF53"}, {"start": 2781, "end": 2793, "text": "(Arum, 2000)", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "Continuing our model's application to public schools, custodians may also experience value tension between societal-level expectations of universal access to education and ''school safety and order'' at the local place (Cornell and Mayer, 2010: 7) .

Our model explains how government administrators and principals of local schools respond to this inclusion-safety tension through harm-mitigating work, including reviewing students' vaccination records, canceling extracurricular activities, and quarantining infected students (Pingali et al., 2019) . In an extreme crisis, our model shows how fear of spreading an infectious disease can outweigh moral emotions of denying students access to education. For instance, in the wake of two recent measles outbreaks, custodians of schools in Clark County, Washington in the U.S. excluded unvaccinated students for several weeks (McRae, 2019) . In addition, claims at local schools may pose threats of harm through violence (Lee, 2013) , recognized as a problem of ''persistence and pervasiveness throughout the history of education'' (Cornell and Mayer, 2010: 7) .

Harm-avoiding proposals-such as arming teachers with guns or zerotolerance policies that expel students for minor disciplinary infractions (Skiba and Knesting, 2001 )-may emerge, disrupting the values of the public school as an accessible and safe place of social inclusion.

Prior research has offered two broad explanations. First, an institution's regulations, norms, and systemic power arouse fear among institutional actors, which disciplines them to conform (Marti and Fernandez, 2013; Gill and Burrow, 2018) . Second, institutional actors may use fear as a motivational force to collectively create, maintain, and change institutions (Moisander, Hirsto, and Fahy, 2016; Wijaya and Heugens, 2018) . Both explanations are rooted in a socialized understanding of fear as being experienced in the context of institutions (Voronov and Vince, 2012) . In contrast, our study of Ebola in a public emergency department reveals the potential for an alternative understanding in which fear is less directly connected to a person's socialization within an institution and operates at a more basic level. This conceptualization resonates with the psychology literature on basic emotions, in which fear is an immediate intuitive reaction to a stimulus that triggers human behavior for survival (Ekman, 1992 (Ekman, , 1999 . Custodians' initial fears about the Ebola virus were basic emotions, and the immediate instinct was self-defense to avoid personal harm. This distinction between fear as a socialized and basic emotion is not trivial. Whereas prior research has shown that socialized fear is an important and relatively straightforward mechanism in institutional maintenance (Creed et al., 2014; Gill and Burrow, 2018) , our study reveals that institutional processes are more complicated when institutional actors feel fear as a basic emotion.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 300, "end": 327, "text": "(Marti and Fernandez, 2013;", "ref_id": "BIBREF54"}, {"start": 328, "end": 350, "text": "Gill and Burrow, 2018)", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 477, "end": 512, "text": "(Moisander, Hirsto, and Fahy, 2016;", "ref_id": "BIBREF58"}, {"start": 513, "end": 538, "text": "Wijaya and Heugens, 2018)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 660, "end": 685, "text": "(Voronov and Vince, 2012)", "ref_id": "BIBREF83"}, {"start": 1123, "end": 1135, "text": "(Ekman, 1992", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 1136, "end": 1150, "text": "(Ekman, , 1999", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 1510, "end": 1530, "text": "(Creed et al., 2014;", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 1531, "end": 1553, "text": "Gill and Burrow, 2018)", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Emotions and Institutional Work"}, {"text": "Our findings suggest that the impact of fear as a basic emotion is moderated by other types of socialized emotions within institutions, most notably moral emotions. In our study, moral emotions that were endogenously embedded in the institution of a place of social inclusion-including empathy for the needs of institutional participants and embarrassment at the possibility of failing to uphold the institution's values-rose up to play off against fear triggered exogenously as a basic emotion by the environmental jolt of the Ebola outbreak. Through their self-consciously evaluative nature, moral emotions helped to dampen fear to the degree that custodians were able to fight against their own basic instincts for self-preservation and engage in institutional work to maintain the institution. A comparable interplay of moral emotions and basic emotions appears to have normalized fears associated with custodian work in response to familiar infectious diseases and patient violence. Thus our model extends prior research on moral emotions by illuminating their critical role in moderating fear, which otherwise has the potential to derail institutional maintenance. We speculate that if a patient suffering from Ebola or behaving violently caused serious harm or death to others, basic emotions might overwhelm more reflective moral emotions and disrupt ordinary processes of institutional maintenance. We call for further research exploring the dynamics of fear and institutional disruption, which events associated with the COVID-19 pandemic suggest is an issue of vital global importance for places of social inclusion.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Emotions and Institutional Work"}, {"text": "Interplay between basic and moral emotions in the unfolding processes of institutional work over time is a unique aspect of our study. Prior empirical studies have tended to ignore basic emotions, possibly because they seem \u00e0 priori to be less theoretically salient to institutions than socialized emotions. The study of emotions in institutions has also been hampered by methodological difficulties of tracing institutional actors' emotions in real time (Goodrick, Jarvis, and Reay, 2019). Our study benefitted methodologically when an unexpected environmental jolt (Meyer, 1982) during our fieldwork cast the basic emotion of fear into sharp relief. Thus it is hardly surprising that the relationships between basic and moral emotions and institutional work revealed in our study have been largely hidden until now. We conjecture that these relationships are generalizable to other institutions beyond places of social inclusion. We suspect, for example, that institutional work to create Canada's first safe narcotics injection sites in Lawrence's (2017) study and institutional work to disrupt organized crime in Sicily in Vaccaro and Palazzo's (2015) study were both enabled by moral emotions controlling institutional actors' basic emotions of fear. In addition to exploring the experience of fear in other types of institutions, we invite investigation of other basic emotions identified in the psychology literature, including anger, disgust, happiness, sadness, and surprise (Ekman, 1992 (Ekman, , 1999 . Future research into institutional work could explore when and how instinctive basic emotions work with and against higher-order reflective emotions that are more closely connected with actors' socialization and embeddedness within institutions, such as moral anger and betrayal (Toubiana and Zietsma, 2017; Wijaya and Heugens, 2018) , shame (Creed et. al., 2014) , other-suffering empathy (Wright, Zammuto, and Liesch, 2017) , and pride (Fan and Zietsma, 2017) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 567, "end": 580, "text": "(Meyer, 1982)", "ref_id": "BIBREF57"}, {"start": 1040, "end": 1057, "text": "Lawrence's (2017)", "ref_id": "BIBREF45"}, {"start": 1127, "end": 1155, "text": "Vaccaro and Palazzo's (2015)", "ref_id": "BIBREF82"}, {"start": 1484, "end": 1496, "text": "(Ekman, 1992", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 1497, "end": 1511, "text": "(Ekman, , 1999", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 1793, "end": 1821, "text": "(Toubiana and Zietsma, 2017;", "ref_id": "BIBREF79"}, {"start": 1822, "end": 1847, "text": "Wijaya and Heugens, 2018)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1856, "end": 1877, "text": "(Creed et. al., 2014)", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 1904, "end": 1939, "text": "(Wright, Zammuto, and Liesch, 2017)", "ref_id": "BIBREF87"}, {"start": 1952, "end": 1975, "text": "(Fan and Zietsma, 2017)", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Emotions and Institutional Work"}, {"text": "Our study brings attention to places of social inclusion as important institutions of the democratic state that provide citizens with universal access to essential human services.
