However, people lack access, skills, and even motivation for home-based fitness. To address these issues, we designed a free access self-monitoring and coaching and music-based interactive online squat fitness system. Body weight squat was utilized for fitness exercise and evaluated based on three indices: knee width, hip depth, and rhythm. An online survey on changes in exercise due to the COVID-19 pandemic and exercise habits was conducted to investigate the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on PA. We collected data from 557 respondents 5 months after the system first released and analyzed 200 visitors' performance on squat exercise and the other relevant parameters. Visitors were divided into three groups according to their age: younger, middle, and older groups. Results showed that the younger group had better squat performance than the middle and older groups in terms of hip depth and rhythm. We highlighted the lessons learned about the system design, fitness performance evaluation, and social aspects, for future study of the design and development of similar home-based fitness systems. We provided first-hand results on the relation between the COVID-19 pandemic and physical exercise among different age groups in Japan, which was valuable for policy making in the post-COVID-19 era.",

Moreover, spending more time at home to keep distance may limit citizens' ability to engage in physical activity (PA) to maintain health and reduce the risk of obesity, diabetes, or other chronic diseases. Recent research showed that sedentary people increased and worldwide PA decreased rapidly during the COVID-19 pandemic. In Japan, from February 11 to June 1, the daily step count decreased up to 30% (7) . An online survey demonstrated a significant decrease in PA time in April, when compared to January 2020 in older adults (8) .",

The use of home-based fitness has increased, and with the current norms of strict social distance and home confinement rules, exercising at home seems to be the new normal and lifestyle for the foreseeable future (10, 11) . However, insufficient information about exercise programs, lack of proper training skills, and long-term motivation for online fitness have become other difficulties that we are facing now (12) .

To our best knowledge, there is still no quantitative evaluation about the effect of decreased PA on physical performance.

The second purpose is to evaluate the developed system by combining exercise performance and the results of exercise change during the early COVID-19 pandemic. We believe that the lessons learned from our study, with respect to either the system design or the system setup, will clearly benefit any future study with similar objectives. More importantly, considering the potential for increasing the risk of health, knowledge about PA performance in different populations during the early COVID-19 pandemic could contribute valuable information for government policy and effort for the next period of the COVID-19 era.",

Visitors can only use Android phones to access the system, at present. The Google Cloud platform was used for uploading and saving data. No collected data are linked to personal identifiable information. Video can only be downloaded by the visitors. Figure 2 shows examples of the system interface. Currently, the system interface language is in Japanese. We designed both literal and video introductions to inform the concept of our system. For the fitness introduction, we provided an example video to explain and coach visitors to perform the right exercise. Some exercise key points, which were utilized as performance evaluation indices, are also introduced. After visitors agreed to the privacy policy and terms of service, they could enter the exercise page. Visitors could choose music from four options, as preferred. We also provided two kinds of counting voice (female and male) during exercise. Visitors could observe their movement and download the data and video after they finished the exercise. The exercise score was given by each squat exercise. Readers can find the system at: Biosignal Art.",

            "text": "Body-weight squats are known to benefit lower body strength and power. Such exercise can improve physical function in the elderly and enhance aerobic capacity and physical fitness (16) (17) (18) . The recommended frequency of squat is 1-2 sets of 10 repetitions for the beginner and 2-3 sets of 20 repetitions for the advanced (4, 19) . We set a 10-repetition squat exercise as one set in this system, and visitors could repeat this exercise as they liked. In order to measure the movement kinematics during squat exercise, we applied PoseNet, a pose estimation program developed by Google (20) . Briefly, PoseNet is a pose estimation program referring to computer version techniques. After feeding through RGB images or video to a convolutional neural network and processed by a special multi-pose decoding algorithm, PoseNet can return the human pose. The pose result contains 2-D x and y coordinates of 17 keypoints, including eyes, nose, shoulders, hips, knees, ankles, and so on. All motion analysis is performed online. Details and computer programs can be found in (21) . Figures 3A,B show an example of body-weight squat and pose estimation using PoseNet. We defined one squat repetition round as 6 s; thus, one set of the exercise will be 60 s. In every repetition round, first, the exerciser is told to look straight ahead, put their arms parallel to the ground, make sure their knees are not inward; then \"sit back\" in 3 s, not round the back and bend the knees; at last, lift up in the rest 3 s, instead of standing up immediately. Accordingly, every repetition was to be evaluated according to three indices: knee width, hip position, and squat rhythm, referenced to (22) . Higher scores represent the optimal squat exercise. Figures 3C-E show the definition and evaluation for Index 1: knee width. The ratio between the knee and shoulder widths ( Figure 3C ) during squat can have a significant effect on the squat kinetics.

Like other physical activities, inappropriate squat performance may impair exercise efficiency and even result in a higher risk of injury (34) . There are several points that need particular attention during squat exercises. Normally, there are three kinds of knee widths for squat: wide, narrow, and shoulder widths. A wide knee width was found to increase the patellofemoral and tibiofemoral compressive forces in the knee joint and a narrow width increases forward knee translation and heightens anterior shear forces (35) . Therefore, a moderate stance with shoulder width or slightly wider was recommended in our system. As the largest muscle in the hip, the gluteus maximums extend the femur and stabilize the pelvis during the squat. Without proper recruitment of the gluteus muscles, other muscles have to bear the load of the squat. This is suboptimal and may result in muscle imbalance (35, 36) . Inadequate depth cannot ensure the training effect, whereas sitting back too deep with difficulty may put users in a dangerous situation such as losing postural balance and falling, especially for older people. Thus, referring to (23), we set three levels of evaluation for the hip position.",

Previous studies have shown that music during or before PA can offer potential benefits to exercise performance, enjoyment, and physiological efficiency (37) (38) (39) . However, to the best of our knowledge, most of the fitness systems only provided some BGMs; further, there was no interactive music feedback so far. In our system, not only the visual (video and scores), but also the audio feedback (interactive music that was made by the visitor through his or her own squat performance) was provided. Some visitors reported that the feedback of the squat performance with music was interesting, and interactive music made it clearer and easier when they were setting their fitness goal, and not only according to the scores. Thus, it is considered that the interactive music provided in our fitness system, which consists of originally composed BGM and audio noise, could provide an extrinsic factor of exercise motivation.",

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that squat exercise has been studied among younger, middle-aged, and older populations in Japan. Moreover, knowledge about squat performance for middle-age populations is still unknown. Compared to the upper limb, a dramatic decrease in muscle mass at the lower extremity was observed in Japanese people after their 20s (46) . Decreased muscular power seems to result in a lower squat score for older people. Moreover, time spent sitting (sedentary time) as well as insufficient PA, is reported to increase the risk for functional decline and muscle mass loss (47) . According to the results from (48), the proportion of sedentary time for the middleaged population is higher than that for the old population, both, for men and women, in Japan.

A significant difference in the squat score for the old group between the first round and the rest rounds was considered to be related to \"fear of falling, \" related to self-defense mechanisms (49) . Fear of falling is known to be associated with poorer PA performance (50, 51) . In order to lower the risk of falling, when performing some demanding motion that requires massive muscle strength, such as a squat, older people do not tend to make the full effort because they may not be confident in their muscle power.

Fortunately, use of wearable technology, such as Fitbit band and Apple watch, allows us to easily collect users' physical activity data on a long term (55) . But it remains an open aspect when consumer grade wearables are largely used, which is the ethical problems: how to manage such a big amount of individual data and how to solve the related privacy and security issues (56).",

In general, the developed system seems usable for the different populations from teenagers to octogenarians. Younger people showed better squat exercise performance than middle-aged and older people. With the stance instruction from Biosignal Art system, all age groups successfully performed optimal knee width during squat exercise. Compared to younger people, older people showed shallower squat depth and worse squat rhythm. Although the short-term study did not show significant effect of changed exercise on peoples' squat performance, we observed a decreased trend of squat performance in older people, which may indicate the possibility of a negative effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on older people's exercise performance, and it may become a risk of health problem in the future.",

For the future system design and setup, it is necessary to focus more on multi-language, exercisers, and categories system, thus more people with their friends and family can keep sufficient physical activity. It is also necessary to make a registration system, or link the fitness system to the user's wearable device in order to track visitors' fitness performance, if users' privacy can be well-protected. Faster pose estimation in order to provide real time feedback is expected. Other exercise categories as well as more detailed introduction/guidance, including breath rhythm are urgently needed.",
