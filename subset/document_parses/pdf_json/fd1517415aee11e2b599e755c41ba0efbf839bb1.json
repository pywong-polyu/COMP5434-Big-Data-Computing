Unfortunately, evaluation of e-SL is not widespread and there is no known study in different Chinese societies. Besides, there are many methodological limitations of the existing studies in the field. In this paper, we evaluated e-SL projects implemented in summer 2020 and 2021 in three sites in China. First, we examined service providers' changes based on pretest and posttest scores (i.e., objective outcome evaluation) and their perceptions of the e-SL projects (i.e., subjective outcome evaluation based on the service providers). Second, graduate student assessors in Chinese mainland universities and teachers of primary school students (i.e., service recipients) rated the SL program quality, service providers' performance and benefits to the service recipients after program completion (i.e., subjective outcome evaluation of SL projects based on other stakeholders). Third, trained graduate student assessors evaluated service quality during the implementation process (i.e., process evaluation). We found that university students (i.e., service providers) showed higher posttest scores in positive youth development attributes, leadership attributes and life satisfaction relative to pretest scores. Besides, service providers showed positive perceptions of their learning experience, own performance, benefits to the service recipients and themselves in the SL projects. Similarly, other stakeholders also had positive evaluation of the SL projects and related benefits. Finally, trained graduate student assessors had positive assessment of the quality of program implementation. The findings underscore the utility of e-SL involving both online teaching and learning as well as online service, particularly in a Chinese context.",

            "text": "Service-Learning (SL) is a pedagogy that aims to consolidate the academic learning of the students through serving needy people and communities (Eyler & Giles, 1999) . The \"traditional\" form of SL is to provide face-to-face service to people in need, such as teaching poor kids on personal hygiene by students of nursing programs. With the tremendous growth of online teaching programs, initiatives on developing electronicservice-learning (e-Service-Learning or e-SL) programs have also increased in recent years (Waldner et al., 2012) . With the occurrence of COVID-19 in December 2019 followed by city lockdown and suspension of classes, teachers and students encountered difficulties in learning activities requiring close contact with the service recipients, such as placement and SL (Shek, 2021) . Hence, e-SL has played an important role under the pandemic where community partners such as NGOs have virtually stopped \"unnecessary\" activities to prevent the spread of the virus. Malvey et al. (2006) defined electronic service-learning as \"an electronic form of experiential education and incorporates electronically supported service learning. It is delivered online and uses the Internet and state of the art technologies that permit students, faculty, and community partners to collaborate at a distance in an organized, focused, experiential service learning activity, which simultaneously promotes civic responsibility and meets community needs\" (p. 187). According to Waldner et al. (2012) , there are different modes of SL based on the dimensions of onsite versus online instruction (i.e., classroom mode versus online mode) and onsite versus online service (i.e., providing service in the field versus online). For the \"traditional\" mode of SL, it involves onsite instruction and onsite service. For Type I e-SL, it operates via online instruction and onsite service. For Type II e-SL, its instruction is onsite and its service is online. For Type III e-SL, it is a mixture of both online and onsite instruction and service. For Type IV e-SL, both instruction and service are online. Faulconer (2021) highlighted several advantages of e-SL, such as lower cost and wider accessibility. Waldner et al. (2012) also pointed out that e-SL can promote student engagement in online courses. On the other hand, there are some criticisms of e-SL, such as inability of the students to experience organizational dynamics and lived experience in the community (Malvey et al., 2006) . Based on a review of 24 studies on e-SL, Stefaniak (2020) highlighted several challenges in e-SL such as awareness of cultural diversity. In a recent review of Type II and Type IV e-SL studies, Faulconer (2021) pointed out that while different conceptual models were used in e-SL courses, there is a need to \"better understand how to evaluate and assess eService-Learning projects\" (p. 114).",

In the second stage, students attended four to five workshops in small groups to learn service skills, such as understanding the needs of the clients, communication skills, and online teaching skills. During this process, the students had to develop their own SL proposals and they wrote reflection assignments. In the third stage, students implemented the project in the online summer camp for around 40 h according to the SL proposals via real-time web conferencing tools. Besides, we engaged trained local graduate students in mainland China (Xi'an Jiaotong University in Xi'an, Sichuan University in Chengdu, and Zhejiang University in Hangzhou) as assessors to rate the implementation quality of the SL projects. We provided training with specific instructions for these graduate students before commencement of the service. After completion of the project, we also invited the graduate student assessors and primary school teachers to evaluate the performance of PolyU students and the quality of the service they had provided. In the final stage, university students providing the service conducted self-evaluation, made presentations on their SL projects, submitted their group presentation reports and wrote a reflective essay on their SL experiences.",

Compared to objective and subjective outcome evaluation, there are fewer studies on process evaluation of SL projects. Process evaluation was defined as \"the use of empirical data to assess the delivery of programs \u2026. Process evaluation verifies what the program is, and whether or not it is delivered as intended to the targeted recipients and in the intended dosage\" (Scheirer, 1994, p. 40) . For example, Sit et al. (2020) conducted process evaluation to understand the implementation of a large family promotion program in Hong Kong. There are several reasons why we should conduct process evaluation in SL. First, process evaluation would be helpful for researchers to understand whether all service-learning components in the SL proposals are effectively implemented (Linnan & Steckler, 2002) . In addition, process evaluation could help researchers understand what happens in the program implementation process that may contribute to the outcomes (Harachi et al., 1999) . Finally, process evaluation could help to prevent Type III error (i.e. a program does not have a good outcome because its implementation quality is not good). Unfortunately, Linnan and Steckler (2002) remarked that while there are many outcome studies, process evaluation studies are few. For example, Durlak (1997) reviewed 1,200 studies and found that very few studies (less than 5%) examined program implementation quality.",

We argue that by using different evaluation mechanisms, researchers can triangulate the evaluation findings. Second, few studies involve different stakeholders to evaluate e-SL projects. As different stakeholders (e.g., university students providing the service, service recipients and NGO staffs) may have different views, the inclusion of views held by different people would be helpful. Third, there are few studies examining online SL teaching adopting a synchronous mode and SL service conducted online. Fourth, many studies used small samples in their evaluation. Fifth, most of studies are cross-sectional studies and studies with data collected over time is almost non-existent. Sixth, there are few SL evaluation studies involving multiple sites. Finally, while the existing studies have been conducted mainly in Western contexts, published non-Western studies on e-SL are very few. With reference to these limitations in the existing SL literature, we report the evaluation findings of two e-SL subjects implemented in summer 2020 and 2021 in three sites in mainland China in this paper.",

Objective outcome evaluation involving pretest and posttest scores: The students responded to a questionnaire covering measures of positive youth development, service leadership attributes and life satisfaction. As another colleague has used the data in other sites for another paper, we focused on the Chengdu data collected in summer 2020 and 2021 in this paper. There are four justifications for focusing on the Chengdu data. First, its sample size is not small if we compared to other similar studies on SL using pretest and posttest data. In the e-SL studies reviewed by Faulconer (2021), the sample size in the studies ranged from 14 to 46 learners. In another study on pretest and posttest differences in SL projects (Shek et al., 2020) , the sample size was 138 university students. Second, in contrast to other studies that usually collected data at one time point, we collected data over two e-summer camps. Third, from a replication perspective, separation examination of the Chengdu data can help to understand the changes of PolyU students in a SL project in Southwest China as opposed to SL projects conducted in other parts of China. Finally, duplicated use of data is basically problematic. 2. Subjective outcome evaluation of the SL programs based on the perspective of the service providers (i.e., PolyU university students): We examined students' perceptions of the quality of the SL project, as well as the perceived changes in themselves and the service recipients. The importance of this from of evaluation can be seen in the remark by Kanwar and Sanjeeva (2022) that \"educational institutions around the world are now requesting students' feedback on all elements of academic life in the form of a satisfaction feedback questionnaire\" (p. 1). In fact, universities are now doing student satisfaction surveys for subjects (including out of class activities) in a routine manner.",

Based on the existing theories (Felten and Clayton, 2011) and research findings on the benefits of service leadership education (Zhu & Shek, 2021b) , we hypothesized that students taking the \"Service Leadership\" subject would change in the positive direction (Hypothesis 1). For the objective outcome evaluation measures, they are aligned with the intended learning outcomes (e.g., empathy and problem solving skills) and content of the subject (e.g., competence, character and care as service leadership qualities). We used three sets of outcome measures to assess the change involved, including indices of personal growth (indexed by the Chinese Positive Youth Development Scale), service leadership attributes and well-being (indexed by life satisfaction). These measures were also used in previous studies to measure the impact of service leadership education (Zhu & Shek, 2021b ). 2. Do university students have positive perceptions of the program quality, their own performance, and benefits of SL projects (i.e., subjective outcome evaluation)? Based on previous findings , we expected that a majority of the service providers would have positive views (Hypothesis 2). It is noteworthy that numerous studies have examined descriptive profiles based on percentage data in the fields of health care (Adhikari et al., 2021; Alsaqri, 2016) , education (Kanwar & Sanjeeva, 2022) and social work (Morrow-Howell et al., 1999) . 3. What are the views of other stakeholders (trained graduate student assessors recruited from the local mainland universities and primary school teachers) on the service quality, performance of university students and benefits to primary school students?

Shek and Ma (2012) pointed out that while subjective outcome evaluation studies commonly focused on the program participants, similar client satisfaction surveys were seldom conducted for other stakeholders. In this study, PolyU students were the SL subject participants whereas trained graduate student assistants and the primary school teachers were \"other stakeholders\". 4. What is the quality of e-SL programs provided based on the views of the graduate student assessors (i.e., process evaluation)? Based on our previous experience and positive feedback from different stakeholders, we expected that the student assessors would have positive evaluation of the quality of program implementation (Hypothesis 4).",

Second, besides looking at pretest-posttest change and client satisfaction findings based on the university students (i.e., service providers), we also collected subjective outcome evaluation data from trained graduate student assessors and primary school teachers (i.e., other stakeholders). Third, in the previous studies, subjective outcome evaluation focused on students' perception of the whole subject. In the present context, we looked at students' satisfaction with the e-SL projects. Finally, we conducted process evaluation by examining the quality of program implementation from the perspective of the graduate student assessors who observed 1,042 teaching sessions. In this paper, \"PolyU students\" refers to students of the Hong Kong Polytechnic University conducting the e-SL projects whereas \"primary school students\" were service recipients in the e-summer camps. For the \"trained graduate student assessors\", we recruited them from a local university near the service site and they evaluated the implementation quality of e-SL projects after training based on assessment guidelines.",

As pointed out by Figuccio (2020) , \"E-service-learning is a relatively new pedagogical practice \u2026 Unlike service-learning, however, e-servicelearning has not been extensively studied and evaluated\" (p. 2). Similarly, Faulconer (2021) remarked that their review \"presents a clear call to research -one that aims at resolving unknowns within eService-Learning\" (p. 100). With reference to the limitations of the existing evaluation studies on e-SL outlined earlier in the paper, this study has several advances. First, we used multiple evaluation strategies to assess the effectiveness of e-SL programs. These included objective outcome evaluation, subjective outcome evaluation of the SL projects based on university students' perspective (i.e., service providers) and other stakeholders' perspectives (trained student assessors and primary school teachers), and process evaluation on the quality of program implementation. These different sources of data can help to triangulate the evaluation findings across different types of data. Second, we engaged different stakeholders, including service providers (i.e., university students), trained graduate student assessors and primary school teachers. Again, this helps to triangulate the evaluation findings across different stakeholders. Third, as there are very few studies adopting Type IV e-SL mode, we focused on Type IV e-SL programs. Fourth, in contrast to the existing studies with small samples, we collected a large number of subjective outcome and process evaluation forms. Fifth, unlike most existing studies involving \"one-shot\" data, we collected data over the summer of 2020 and 2021. This can help to consolidate the evaluation findings over time. Sixth, we collected data over multiple sites instead of a single site. Finally, we collected data from a non-Western context. As far as the generalizability of the findings are concerned, the present study showed that the observations were generalized over time, site and culture based on data collected via different methods and stakeholders. For the change in the university students (i.e., service providers), the findings support Hypothesis 1. These findings triangulated the previous studies based on face-to-face SL (e.g., Shek et al., 2020) . The positive changes occur in three areas in this study. First, the students showed positive change in PYD attributes (except moral competence). As the subject covered leadership competence (e.g., adversity and problem solving skills) and the students actually practiced the related skills in the process (such as improvised under changing conditions of the pandemic), this can explain why the change is in the positive direction. Second, the students showed positive change in service leadership beliefs and values, character and care. Again, as we covered the attributes of service leadership in the subject and the students had opportunities to practice and reflect on their leadership qualities (e.g., care about the service recipients and doing the SL project in a responsible manner), this can explain for the positive change. Finally, life satisfaction of the students also changed in the positive direction. In the Service Leadership Theory and previous studies using cross-lagged analyses (Zhu & Shek, 2021b) , we proposed that service leadership attributes positively promoted the well-being of the students. Nevertheless, despite these positive findings, as there was no control group, other alternative explanations such as maturation may explain the positive change. Besides, as we did not assess the transformational processes in the process of \"change\" in the students (Kiely, 2004) , future studies should explore this area. One possibility is to analyze the reflections of the students but this is beyond the scope of this study.",

Using percentage data, the findings suggest that the SL programs were beneficial to the service recipients and the university students themselves. Of course, subjective outcome evaluation may be criticized as \"too subjective\". However, we have three counter-arguments to this criticism. First, looking at client satisfaction profile is a very common approach in human services evaluation, including social work, education and allied health disciplines. Second, researchers and practitioners have regarded client satisfaction survey as an important approach of evaluation. In the area of health care, Comans et al. (2011) remarked that \"the most reported outcome related to patients was satisfaction surveys\" (p. 19). In the area of education, Santini et al. (2017) pointed out that student satisfaction had been widely examined in the past three decades. Third, studies showed that objective outcome evaluation and subjective outcome evaluation were actually correlated significantly (Shek, 2010 (Shek, , 2014 .",

There are three unique aspects of the findings. First, as there is no published study on process evaluation on e-SL, this is a pioneer study. Second, we prepared an assessment guideline for the graduate students. Third, the trained graduate student assistants rated a large number of teaching sessions. According to Limbani et al. (2019) , \"process evaluation is increasingly recognized as an important component of effective implementation research and yet, there has been surprisingly little work to understand what constitutes best practice\" (p. 1). Hence, this study has contributed to our understanding of the implementation quality of the SL projects. In future, researchers can consider using more items on the quality of the implementation process (Shek & Sun, 2013a, b) . Besides, we should involve more raters to ensure inter-rater reliability. In the present context, we were not able to involve more raters because of the pandemic.",

As we collected data over two years, this can give us a more stable picture about the impact of e-SL programs. Second, from a replication perspective, the present findings replicated the findings reported in these two studies based on aggregation of data over time. Third, while the previous two studies examined subjective outcome evaluation of the subjects, we examined students' views on the e-SL projects. Fourth, besides looking at pretest-posttest change and client satisfaction findings based on the university students (i.e., service providers), we also collected subjective outcome evaluation data on SL projects from trained graduate student assessors and primary school teachers (i.e., other stakeholders). This is very important because triangulation is an important principle in evaluation. Finally, we conducted process evaluation by examining the quality of program implementation from the perspective of the graduate student assessors who observed 1,042 teaching sessions.",

Besides, other models on human behavior may provide insights on the possible developmental outcomes of SL. For example, with reference to the bio-psychosocial-spiritual model (Sulmasy, 2002) , spiritual domain is an important but neglected study. In this study, we found that spirituality in students increased after joining the SL subject. In future, it would be theoretically important to see whether e-SL would promote life meaning (such as engaging in prosocial behavior) in the students taking the SL subject. Besides, it would be theoretically interesting to use different quality of life models (Felce & Perry, 1995; Wallander et al., 2001) to ask how e-SL may shape the quality of life in various domains in different stakeholders.",

First, although university students showed positive changes over time, no control group was used. The non-inclusion of a control group obviously raises the question of alternative explanations such as natural maturation. Second, although the number of rating forms collected under subjective outcome evaluation by university students and process evaluation is large, the number of evaluation forms based on the other stakeholders is not high. This may be due to the fact that it was difficult to engage the trained graduate student assessors and primary school teachers after completion of the SL programs. Third, we should understand the limitations of subjective outcome evaluation approach to evaluation, despite its widespread use in different disciplines. Fourth, more items can be added to the process evaluation rating form, such as the classroom interaction and management of the service providers. Effort to involve more raters in the process would also be helpful. Fifth, while the quantitative findings based on the four evaluation mechanisms are positive, it would be helpful to collect qualitative data to understand the lived experiences and underlying mechanisms involved (Patton & Campbell-Patton, 2021) .
