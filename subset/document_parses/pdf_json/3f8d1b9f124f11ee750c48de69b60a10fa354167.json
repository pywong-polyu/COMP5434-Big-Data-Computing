            "text": "Cyber insurance is a risk management option to cover financial losses caused by cyberattacks. Researchers have focused their attention on cyber insurance during the last decade. One of the primary issues related to cyber insurance is estimating the premium. The effect of network topology has been heavily explored in the previous three years in cyber risk modeling. However, none of the approaches has assessed the influence of clustering structures. Numerous earlier investigations have indicated that internal links within a cluster reduce transmission speed or efficacy. As a result, the clustering coefficient metric becomes crucial in understanding the effectiveness of viral transmission. We provide a modified Markov-based dynamic model in this paper that incorporates the influence of the clustering structure on calculating cyber insurance premiums. The objective is to create less expensive and less homogenous premiums by combining criteria other than degrees. This research proposes a novel method for calculating premiums that gives a competitive market price. We integrated the epidemic inhibition function into the Markov-based model by considering three functions: quadratic, linear, and exponential. Theoretical and numerical evaluations of regular networks suggested that premiums were more realistic than premiums without clustering. Validation on a real network showed a significant improvement in premiums compared to premiums without the clustering structure component despite some variations. Furthermore, the three functions demonstrated very high correlations between the premium, the total inhibition function of neighbors, and the speed of the inhibition function. Thus, the proposed method can provide application flexibility by adapting to specific company requirements and network configurations.",

Based on the network structure, cyber insurance modeling can be divided into nonnetwork models and network models. Several mathematical models were introduced into the nonnetwork model. Farkas et al.

Other mathematical models are the betabinomial model by B\u00f6hme and Schwartz [9], copula by Herath and Herath [10], collective risk theory by Mukhopadhyay et al.

Hua and Xu [18] proposed a risk-spreading and recovering algorithm for generating synthetic data. To account for the uncertainty of random large-scale network topology, they adopted a scale-free network framework. Xu and Hua [19] considered the network model through Markov, non-Markov, and copula processes. In the area of cyberattacks, Markov-based models are frequently utilized. Along with the epidemic model, this model can detect abnormalities caused by cyber threats under noise restriction [20] . Some researchers use wavelet analysis [21] for cybersecurity models, such as the detection of attack anomalies in network traffic [22, 23] or disease spread models [24] . In the Markov-based cyber insurance model, the generalized SIS process (\u03b5-SIS) [25] describes the virus spread dynamics in a network. Xu and Hua [19] used cost functions for two types of losses: data damage losses and system downtime losses. Insurance premiums are calculated from a microlevel perspective using the standard deviation premium principle and the utility principle. A small ten-node network was used as a case study, and an Enron e-mail network was used as an application of the models.",

            "text": "Currently, cyber risk management using cyber insurance is increasingly needed. Cyber risk is a type of operational risk that arises from the execution of cyberspace activities, posing a threat data from infection and recovery dynamics based on certain assumptions is shown as the solution to current cyber incident data limitations. Thus, network characteristics and metrics are critical considerations in modeling the dynamics of virus spread. However, experimental results by Xu and Hua [19] only showed the strong influence of the degree of a node in a network on cyber losses and premiums. To confirm this, we conducted a study on the regular graph using the Markov model and obtained similar results [26] . The degree of a node can only explain the number of neighbors but has not described the relationship between neighbors. Two or more nodes with the same degree can have different neighboring connection structures. The structure between neighbors of a node can be described by a network metric called the clustering coefficient, which is a clustering coefficient for how closely nodes in a graph cluster together [27] . In other words, the clustering coefficient can explain the clustering structure of a network. Several experiments have shown the influence of the clustering coefficient on disease transmission [28] [29] [30] [31] . Assuming that social networks have a high community structure and clustering coefficient, Wu and Liu [32] proposed a new model to study their influence on epidemics. According to their findings, the degree of the community determines the spread of epidemics in community networks. In contrast, an increase in the clustering coefficient reduces the epidemic spread efficiency for a community with a fixed degree. Using the SIS process, Bo Song et al. [33] concluded the same thing that in a homogeneous network (same degree for each node), clustering could inhibit epidemics. Conversely, there is no inhibiting effect during infection in heterogeneous networks. However, no one has created a model at the individual level that can explain the dynamic process of infection to the status of an individual [34] .",

We incorporate the coefficient clustering function [32, 33] into the transition probability of the Markov model or \u03b5-SIS process [25] . Cyber insurance rates are calculated using the cost function based on two types of losses by Xu and Hua [19] . In contrast, the simulation process is run using a modified Markov-based simulation with different infection rates. In previous work, we used the average degree factor as a matrix of the network in a compartment SIS process [35] . We propose a modified Markov-based algorithm with different rates at the individual-level \u03b5-SIS model to generate synthetic cyber-attack data in this study. This algorithm is a modification of the individual-level SIS process algorithm with homogeneous rates. The procedure was implemented through a case study on a regular (homogeneous) network using random regular graph sampling [36, 37] . Furthermore, the regular graph's theoretical background and its relationship to the local clustering effect are also presented in this paper. Moreover, the findings are validated by implementation on a real network (large network).",

The upper bound obtained by the model without the clustering coefficient is the same as that obtained by Xu and Hua (2019) [19] . It can be seen from the upper bound of each node that coincides with each other. By studying regular graphs, Antonio and Indratno (2021) [26] support the substantial effect of degrees on the model. Other factors that impact the rate of infection have not been explored in this model. However, the clustering structure can affect the speed or effectiveness of propagation, where nodes can have different infection rates [32, 33] . Through local clustering coefficients, each node undergoes an infection rate adjustment that depends on the inhibitory function. The three inhibiting parts considered earlier had different impacts on the upper bound of infection probabilities. The upper bound with the quadratic function gives a slight change compared to the upper bound without the clustering coefficient effect. Then, the linear function has a moderate impact, and the exponential function has a reasonably strong influence. Therefore, these functions represent the level of impact of the clustering structure on the speed and effectiveness of the spread of the virus. Based on the model in Eq (7), the transition probability of a node depends on the sum of the clustering coefficient functions of its neighbors. The upper bounds of the three functions have the same pattern. Node 5 always produces the highest upper bound and is followed by nodes 20, 10, and 15. Table 1 summarizes the clustering coefficients of the four neighbors of each node, the total clustering coefficients and the totals of the three functions. This fact supports the upper bound result. Node 5 produces the highest total clustering coefficient functions for linear, quadratic, and exponential functions. Sequentially, nodes 20, 10, and 15 have a total clustering coefficient in the linear, quadratic and exponential functions below node 5. This confirms that the upper bound depends on the clustering coefficient function of the neighbors. ",

For all three functions, the figure depicts a positive linear relationship between TN and UB, which means that while TN grows, UB grows as well. The linear relationship is given by UB \u00bc a 0 \u00fe a 1 TN: \u03b1 0 represents the intercept, \u03b1 1 represents the slope of the linear model, and R 2 represents the coefficient of determination. The coefficient of determination measures how well the independent variable can predict the fluctuation of the dependent variable. The linear relationship is powerful when R 2 is close to one. When R 2 is close to one, the linear connection is quite strong. Let R 2 L ; R 2 Q , and R 2 E be R 2 for linear, quadratic, and exponential functions. With R 2 L ; R 2 Q ; R 2 E > 0:9, the three functions have a strong relationship. As a result, TN can account for more than 90% of UB. For linear, quadratic, and exponential functions, \u03b1 0 is 0.12, 0.09, and 0.14, respectively. For linear, quadratic, and exponential functions, \u03b1 1 is 0.06, 0.07, and 0.05, respectively. The upper bound is affected more strongly by the exponential inhibition function. As a result, it is obvious that the risk of transmission is no longer homogenous (same upper bound when degrees are equal) but instead has a significant correlation with the total inhibitory function of neighbors.

In addition, the difference (\u0394) for each (n sim ) is taken into consideration. When n sim is increased, all three variables converge to the same value. At n sim = 500, all figures are convergent on average. However, divergence is still apparent for each node at n sim = 500. At n sim = 2000, each node has begun to converge. If the difference (\u0394) between the number of simulations is close to or equal to zero, the percentage change (\u0394) implies convergence. As seen in Fig  9 for the variables \u0394Infection Mean, \u0394Loss Mean, and \u0394Premiums, all nodes and their averages approach zero as n sim is increased, and the simulation is considered to be convergent at n sim = 2000. Finally, for the premium set, we choose n sim = 2000 as the number of simulations. On the 4-regular graph, premiums have been modified to account for the clustering structure. The linear relationship (correlation) between the total linear, quadratic, and exponential inhibitory functions (TN) and the premium is visualized in Fig 10. For twenty nodes with linear, quadratic, and exponential functions, the correlation between TN and P is more than 0.6, suggesting a strong and moderately strong linear relationship.

Conversely, the TN that is less than the degree corrects the premiums by the difference between TN and degrees. Node 5, with the largest TN for linear, quadratic, and exponential functions, provides the most extensive premium in comparison to other nodes. TN decreases when the trend of inhibitory function decreases, resulting in a decrease in the premium reduction trend. Premiums with an exponential inhibition function are the least expensive option.

According to these parameters, this network has 143 nodes and 623 links. With the density D equal to 0.0613, this network is classified as of extremely low density. Out of the 142 potential communications, the maximum communication (d max ) occurs only between 42 accounts (neighbors). C avg and C can be used to characterize the clustering structure of this network. C avg = 0.4339 shows that some nodes have a high local clustering coefficient, while others have a low coefficient. The clustering coefficient at the global level is C = 0.3590. This measure suggests that |T| = 2700 accounts for approximately 35.9% of all triangles constructed in this network. If we focus just on the degree component, we see that nodes with a high degree have an increased risk and premium.

Two nodes with the same degree, namely, node 3 and node 9, were chosen to demonstrate the influence of their local clustering coefficients of neighbors. As expected, nodes with a high degree also have a high total C. However, it does not occur on all nodes. For instance, node 136 with degrees 17 and node 17 with degrees 30 have the same total C. Nodes 95 and 48 have a lower total clustering coefficient than node 136 due to their degrees 23 and 20. This measure incorporates both degrees and the local clustering coefficient.

The most expensive premium is provided by node 105, which has the highest degree 42. The premium associated with the clustering coefficient demonstrates a shift by offering a lower price. Three functions quadratic, linear, or exponential are all adaptations of the function, with the fastershrinking function resulting in reduced premiums. At nodes 3 and 9, the importance of the results is immediately apparent. Both nodes have a degree of 12. Without regard for the clustering arrangement, these two nodes offer the identical premium of 2.9. (currency unit). However, after adapting to the clustering structure of its neighbors, node 3 provides a lower price. These findings are consistent with the fact that node 3 has a lower total clustering inhibition function than node 4. This approach is successful because it takes the metric under consideration so that the premium is dependent on both the degree and the clustering structure.",

The boxplot findings corroborate the evidence of an improvement in the premium price model with the clustering structure. Each range of boxplots decreases when the model without CC is replaced with the model with CC using quadratic, linear, and exponential functions. Similarly, an outlier in each boxplot, namely, the best premium, shows that each function decreases. In aggregate, Fig 14 is a combination of a confidence interval plot and a bar plot depicting a network's premiums (a total of 143 nodes). These findings also corroborate earlier findings that the presence of a clustering structure might lower premiums. With clustering coefficients, the premiums for quadratic, linear, and exponential functions fell by 2.99%, 8.07%, and 11.78%, respectively. Thus, the overall premium generated by the inhibition function is lower than the premium without the clustering structure. Fig 15 shows the linear correlation between degrees (deg), the total clustering coefficient functions of neighbors (F. QUA, F. LIN, F. EXP), the premium without clustering coefficient (P), the premiums with a linear function (P. LIN), a quadratic function (P. QUA), and an exponential function (P.EXP). Degree, F. QUA, F. LIN, and F. EXP are highly correlated because they are the sum of local clustering coefficients from neighboring nodes. The distinction is in the scale of the adjacency matrix of the model. The value is now between zero and one (in the range of C and f(C)). The correlation between premiums is extremely strong, with values greater than 0.9. Premiums with local clustering coefficients are used to compensate without clustering coefficients. The correlation between premiums and degree (Deg), F. QUA, F. LIN, and F. EXP decreased from P, P. QUA, P. LIN, and P. EXP sequentially. The more quickly the clustering function decays, the stronger the connection between the premium and the inhibition function. This result means that the inhibitory function chosen affects this relationship. ",

To validate the findings, we conducted two types of experiments: regular and real networks. Additionally, theories on regular networks have been established to verify that clustering coefficients influence regular networks. Without the impact of clustering coefficients and a homogeneous rate, each node generates an equal premium. The epidemic inhibition factor was multiplied by the local clustering coefficient to modify the infection rate. As a result, this approach can provide premiums that vary depending on the inhibition function employed, which can be quadratic, linear, or exponential. The results are also significant in large networks (real networks). The correlation between the total inhibitory function and the premiums is stronger than that between the degree and the premiums. Thus, this approach calculates the premium more comprehensively since it considers two network properties, namely, the degree and the local clustering coefficient.",

By giving a more realistic premium based on the clustering structure, this suggested technique can improve the Markovbased model developed by Xu and Hua (2019) [19] and Antonio and Indratno (2021) [26] . Thus, the flexibility of the proposed approach in application enables it to provide premium improvements that are not homogenous (overestimate) and are more suitable. The limitation is the inclusion of a single element impacting the efficacy of the epidemic. Indeed, the model may incorporate a wide range of other variables. Another limitation is that each node continues to perform the same function. The inhibitory properties of each node may vary.",
