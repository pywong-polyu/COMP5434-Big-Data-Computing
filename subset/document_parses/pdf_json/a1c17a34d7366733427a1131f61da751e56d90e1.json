Besides recruiting retired healthcare workers, medical students were considered to support this task. Commitment of medical students in Germany during the COVID-19 pandemic was evaluated using an online survey, with particular focus on their burdens and anxieties. This survey was distributed to students within a 2-week period in April and May 2020. Ultimately, 1241 participants were included in the analysis. During the pandemic, 67.9% (65.3% to 70.5%) of the participants reported that they had volunteered. Furthermore, 88.9% (86.9% to 90.5%) stated that they were against compulsory recruitment in this context. Students who volunteered (committed students) had a significantly lower anxiety index than non-committed students. Additionally, students were more concerned about infecting other patients and relatives than themselves. Higher levels of anxiety were related to lower levels of commitment. A mandatory assignment during the pandemic was rejected by the students and does not seem to be necessary due to the large number of volunteers.",

            "text": "At the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, knowledge about the virus was very limited. Early data from China suggested that healthcare workers had an increased risk of infection with the virus. 1 Due to the spread of COVID-19 and the growing number of infected persons, the question arose as to how cover these shortages of staff within the healthcare sector. 2 During the search for potential practitioners, two possible groups were identified namely retired healthcare workers and medical students. 3 However, recruitment of retired staff was problematic, as it became clear that the risk of severe infection with COVID-19 increases with age. 4 Therefore, medical students were identified as the preferred option to help the heavily burdened healthcare sector. 3 This idea was not fundamentally new. There are two prominent examples, from the last century, when medical students were involved in fighting and overcoming a pandemic or epidemic. 5 During the Spanish flu (1918) , medical students at the University of Pennsylvania were recruited to take care of patients. 6 Approximately four decades later (1952) , medical students manually ventilated tracheostomised patients during the Danish polio epidemic. 7 Based on these experiences, it is not surprising that several countries tried to accelerate the graduation of medical students along with intensified training of recently graduated physicians in order to treat patients with COVID-19. 5 Currently, there is no research providing insights on anxiety level of committed medical students regarding potential viral infections during the pandemic. Therefore, we analysed this in the present study. We hypothesised that high individual levels of trait anxiety and low levels of empathy impact an individual's decision to volunteer during the pandemic. Furthermore, we reasoned that specific fear to become infected would impact willingness for commitment. Besides these intrinsic factors, we also analysed the financial situation of students (extrinsic factor).",

The questions assessed different aspects of the student's commitment during the COVID-19 pandemic. We systematically contacted all student representatives of medical faculties in Germany and asked them to share the link to the online survey with the students. Furthermore, we contacted the medical students via social media. Sample size calculation was based on the proportion of medical students who had voluntarily committed to help. As no prior information on this proportion was available, a hypothetical proportion of 50% was assumed. This assumption maximises the required sample size and results in the most conservative sample size estimation of n=383 for a stipulated 95% CI, 5% error and a finite population size of approximately 100 000 medical students in Germany.",

These items were measured on a 10-point Likert scale, ranging from 'total disagreement' (1) to 'fully agree' (10) .

We found an inverse connection between anxiety and commitment: the level of trait anxiety was directly connected with volunteering rate and fear about the risk of infection. In a survey that analysed the psychological well-being of 1000 Greek students from various disciplines, students showed a significant increase in anxiety and depression during the pandemic. The level of anxiety was dependent on various factors, such as socioeconomic background, prolonged study duration, changes in everyday life and social structure during the pandemic. 11 Our data suggest that gender seems to be a predictive factor. We found significantly higher levels of anxiety in female when compared with male medical students. The level of anxiety was especially high in non-committed students. Interestingly, many studies have reported female gender as a predictive factor for higher levels of depression and anxiety, potentially due to a co-occurrence of additional stress factors (eg, childcare, lower socioeconomic background). 14 It has been speculated that the psychological effects on healthcare workers related to the current pandemic are driven by numerous factors. 15 This includes lack of beneficial therapies, shortages of healthcare capacities, limited personal protective equipment, uncertainty of the actual situation, limited information about the virus and uncertainty about the length of the pandemic. 15 16 In extreme situations, when more resources are required than available, psychological strain can escalate. Then, decision-makers face an ethical dilemma regarding the question of who can be treated with currently available resources. 17 18 This might be aggravated in early stages of a pandemic without having evidence-based guidance. Therefore, the crucial question seems to be how to mitigate psychological distress and how to deal with challenging ethical questions. Based on experiences from the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak and the early stage of COVID-19, psychological support should be offered to affected groups. 15 19 Establishing regular meetings with supervisors also helped to mitigate levels of anxiety and stress. 15 20 Medical schools are aware of this need and established, for instance, checking-in emails, online meeting platforms and discussion rounds. 21 Our study shows that medical schools across Germany fulfilled these imminent needs. The participants in our survey reported having enough time to discuss their situation or problems and seek advice. So, the basis for successful voluntary work of students to fight the pandemic seems to be given.",

            "text": "A recent study from China reported that approximately 90% of respondents exhibited discriminatory attitudes toward people and regions associated with the COVID-19 outbreak. 22 It is well known that perceived societal stigma has a negative impact on mental health. 23 The societal stigma of infectious diseases is not completely new. It has also been noted in the context of HIV among gay and bisexual men. 24 In the '80s and '90s of last century, the stigmatisation was based on anxiety, uncertainty, and lack of information and treatment. 24 25 Similar experiences of stigmatisation might be associated with COVID-19 today, recently published data revealed a tendency of COVID-19 stigmatisation. 23 In the past, it has been assumed that extensive information campaigns and goal-oriented lessons in medical schools would overcome this kind of discrimination. 25 Nevertheless, a considerable proportion of medical students and physicians still demonstrate their fears when interacting with patients with HIV. 26 27 It is well known that fears and discrimination jeopardise patient-doctor relationships, leading to poorer care and worse outcomes. 26 27 Therefore, it is of great importance that medical educators are aware of potential stigmatisation, avoiding mistakes of the past by using lesson learnt approaches. In patients with HIV/AIDS, it has been proposed that medical educators must be prepared to help students overcome prejudice and increase their capacity for empathy toward patients with AIDS. 28 This strategy seems to be applicable to patients with COVID-19. Furthermore, this strategy might help to prevent ethical debates (known from AIDS/HIV) about physicians' rights to refuse treatment. 28 Another solution seems to be volunteerism. It is known that medical students who had contact to stigmatised groups of people or patients showed decreased levels of prejudice and fear. 10 Even though we found high levels of satisfaction and proudness when volunteering during the COVID-19 pandemic in our study, COVID-19 also leads to new ethical dilemmas for volunteers. Other studies reported that many students reported moral distress when watching patients being isolated from loved ones or when feeling distant from patients while wearing personal protective equipment. 29 Furthermore, students felt not only anxious about COVID-19 but also vulnerable. 23 The anxieties are enhanced in volunteers working on the pandemic's front lines. It seems to be important for medical students to have the opportunity to discuss such concerns with supervisors. 30 Based on the results of our survey, medical students across Germany stated that they had good opportunities for such interactions. The supervisions also offered the opportunity to discuss bioethical issues that previously seemed theoretical, namely, rationing Figure 2 Opinion of German medical students concerning an obligatory commitment during the pandemic in relative numbers. Numbers above columns indicate the absolute number of students in each group. Test for statistical significance between committed and noncommitted students was performed using the \u03a7 2 test. n.s., not significant. and futility of care. Medical educators can teach students about ways of allocating scarce resources and improving end-of-life care. 29 It is also important to take care of students who cannot volunteer during the COVID-19 pandemic due to personal health issues. These students often reported high levels of guilt that others had to step in; they frequently complained about disappointment or frustration about not being able to help. 29 30 However, students who could not or did not want to work directly with patients with COVID-19 could be very valuable in other functions. A report from Canada showed that an interaction of seniors with students via video call significantly reduces the impact of loneliness. 31 Students who participated in this project also regained self-esteem and purpose in a social role. They had better mental health status and reported lower levels of helplessness. 31 Alternatively, medical students could support healthcare departments or get involved in the organisation of online medical education. 5 In our survey, we found that medical students felt high levels of proudness and satisfaction by volunteering during the pandemic. However, current research also indicates that the current pandemic will have an impact on their future careers. Byrnes et al 32 reported that approximately one-fifth of surveyed medical students in the USA (1668 medical students participate in this study, the survey included all 150 American Association of Medical Colleges medical schools in the USA, Hawaii and Alaska) assume that COVID-19 will affect their study duration and choice of specialty. Many students are raising concerns that they cannot explore specialisations or obtain recommendation letters. Since we do not know how the COVID-19 pandemic will continue, we should proceed in the spirit of Zuger and Miles 33 : 'Medicine is an inherently moral enterprise, the success and future of which depend to a great extent on the integrity of individual professionals as they face the duties the calling of healer entails.' Based on the currently available evidence of medical students during the COVID-19 pandemic and due to the results of our survey, we have the justified hope that the new generations of doctors are strongly committed to the people.",

A dramatic increase in infected patients or the availability of a vaccine/therapy may have an impact on these results. \u25ba Since the survey was done in Germany, the data are limited to German medical students. Students from other disciplines or other countries may show different behaviours. \u25ba After our systematic consultation of the student representatives of German medical faculties, we had no influence on further distribution of the link. This may lead to minor estimation biases. However, we do not see significant differences in the proportion of committed students between northern and southern Germany. \u25ba We did not use previously proposed measures for anxiety 34 in our study. Therefore, it might be possible that exploring anxiety by using these previously described instruments might result in different findings.
