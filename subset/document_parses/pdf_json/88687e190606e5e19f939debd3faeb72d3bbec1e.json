This application allows the identification of phylogenetic clusters and genotypes from assembled genomes in FASTA format. Since its release in 2019, we have produced a number of typing tools for emergent viruses that have caused large outbreaks, such as Zika and Yellow Fever Virus in Brazil. Here, we present the Genome Detective Coronavirus Typing Tool that can accurately identify the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-related coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) sequences isolated in China and around the world. The tool can accept up to 2000 sequences per submission and the analysis of a new wholegenome sequence will take approximately 1 min. The tool has been tested and validated with hundreds of whole genomes from 10 coronavirus species, and correctly classified all of the SARS-related coronavirus (SARSr-CoV) and all of the available public data for SARS-CoV-2. The tool also allows tracking of new viral mutations as the outbreak expands globally, which may help to accelerate the development of novel diagnostics, drugs and vaccines to stop the COVID-19 disease.",

A maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree, 1000 bootstrap replicates were constructed in PhyML (Guindon and Gascuel, 2003; Lemoine et al., 2018 ) and a Bayesian tree using MrBayes (Ronquist and Huelsenbeck, 2003) were constructed. The trees were visualized in Figtree (Rambaut, 2018) . We selected 25 reference sequences that represent the diversity of each well-defined phylogenetic cluster (with bootstrap support of 100% and posterior probability of 1). We identified five well-supported phylogenetic clusters with more than two sequences of SARSr-CoV and used them to set up our automated phylogenetic classification tool. Cluster 1 included SARS strains from the 2002 and 2003 Asian outbreaks. In our tool, we named this cluster SARS-CoV Outbreak 2000s but may rename it as SARS-CoV-1 if a new proposed naming system for SARSr-Cov is adopted in the near future. Cluster 2 (provisionally named as SARS related CoV) includes seven sequences from bats which did not cause large human outbreaks. Cluster 3 (named as Bat SARS-CoV HKU3) includes three WGS sampled from Rhinolophus sinicus (i.e. Chinese rufous horseshoe bats). Cluster 4 (Bat SARS-CoV ZXC21/ZC45) includes two SARSr-CoV sampled from Rhinolophus sinicus bats in Zhoushan, China. Cluster 5 (virus named SARS-CoV-2 by the ICTV committee and disease named COVID-19 by the WHO) includes three public sequences from the outbreak. We identified this cluster with many sequences from GISAID but kept only three ones as these were the first GenBank sequences. The first whole genome of SARS-CoV-2 was kindly shared by Prof. Yong-Zhen Zhang and colleagues in the virological.org website.

To determine the accuracy of this tool, each of the 431 test WGS was considered for evaluation (i.e. 384 reference sequences from VIPR and 47 public SARS-CoV-2 sequences). The sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of our method were calculated for both species assignment and phylogenetic clustering of SARSr-CoV. Sensitivity was computed by the formula TP TP\u00feFN , specificity by TN TN\u00feFP and accuracy by Classifying query sequences in an automated fashion involves two steps. The first step enables virus species assignments and the second, which is restricted to SARSr-CoV, includes phylogenetic analysis. The first classification analysis subjects a query sequence to BLAST and AGA analysis. AGA is a novel alignment method for nucleic acid sequences against annotated genomes from NCBI RefSeq Virus Database. AGA (Deforche, 2017) expands the optimal alignment algorithms of Smith and Waterman (1981) and Gotoh (1982) based on an induction state with additional parameters. The result is a more accurate aligner, as it takes into account both nucleotide and protein scores and identifies all of the polymorphisms at nucleotide and amino acid levels. In the second step, a query sequence is aligned against the phylogenetic reference dataset using -add alignment option in the MAFFT software (Katoh and Standley, 2013) . In addition, a Neighbor-Joining phylogenetic tree is constructed using the HKY distance metric with gamma among-site rate variation with 1000 bootstrap replicates using PAUP* (Swofford, 2003) . The query sequence is assigned to a particular phylogenetic cluster if it clusters monophyletically with that clade or a subset of it with bootstrap support >70%. If the bootstrap support is <70%, the genotype is reported to be unassigned.",

Genome Detective Coronavirus Typing Tool assembles genomes from nextgeneration sequencing (NGS) in FASTAQ format or assembled genomes in FASTA format. A user can submit up to 1 Gb of NGS data or 2000 assembled genomic sequences. For each assembled genomic sequence, the tool identifies the virus species, constructs a phylogenetic tree and identifies phylogenetic clusters, which includes the novel coronavirus identified in Wuhan, China in 2019 (SARS-CoV-2). The tool identifies changes at nucleotides, coding regions and proteins using a novel dynamic aligner and display all of the mutations in detailed tables and reports Amino acid (aa) alignment is compared with four-related coronaviruses. The tool also calculates the percentage aa identities with reference to SARS-CoV-2 as shown here for the complete (1274 aa) spike protein contains an interactive phylogenetic tree and genome mapper ( Supplementary Fig. S1 ). It also presents the virus species and cluster assignments and a detailed table that provides information about open reading frames (ORFs), CDS and proteins. This table can be expanded to show nucleotide and amino acid mutations that differentiate a query sequence from their species RefSeq or from a sequence in the phylogenetic reference dataset. All results can be exported to a variety of file formats (XML, CSV, Excel, Nexus or FASTA).",

In total, 94.8% (73/77) of the amino acids were identical; the four amino acid differences were located at positions 55 (T55S), 56 (V56F), 69 (69deletion) and 70 (G70R). The spike protein (protein S), which can be associated with virulence, was 76.2% identical to the reference strain of SARSr-CoV (Supplementary Table S4A ). Interestingly, there were four amino acid insertions at position 237 (A237_F238insHRSY, genome NT position 22202_22203insCATAGAAGTTAT), which is just upstream from a cleavage site. There is also a four amino acid insertion PRRA at the spike protein at positions 681 to 684. This is at the junction of S1 and S2 and creates a new polybase cleavage site. Our tool also allows us to compare mutations with other-related sequences, such as the Pangolin, Bat RaTG13, the Bat SARS-CoV and SARS Sin940 (Figure 2 and Supplementary Table S2 ). The most diverse coding regions were the CDS Sars8a and Sars8b. In these two regions, only 30% of the amino acids were identical. Sars8b protein was truncated early and its CDS had four stop codons (Supplementary Table S4A ).",
