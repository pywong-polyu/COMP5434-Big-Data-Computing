            "text": "Background Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is associated with cognitive dysfunction. Cognitive function in children with CKD residing in developing countries has not been previously reported. Methods This cross-sectional study included children aged 6-18 years with CKD stages 2-5D and kidney transplant. Cognitive function was assessed by WISC-V for children from 6-16 years of age. In adolescents 17-18 years of age, WAIS-III was used. Factors associated with cognitive dysfunction were identified using multivariable regression analysis. Results Thirty-seven children with median age 13.9 (11.3-15.7) years were recruited. The median full-scale intelligence quotient (FSIQ) was 83.0 (71.0-95.0). Below-average cognitive function (FSIQ <90) was identified in 24 children (64.8%), 24.3% of whom had cognitive impairment (FSIQ <70). Most children (94.6%) scored lower than average on at least 1 cognitive domain. Kidney replacement therapy (p = 0.03) and low family income (p = 0.02) were associated with belowaverage cognitive function in multivariable logistic regression analysis. Children who left school and low family income were significantly associated with cognitive function. The FSIQ of children who had left school was 12.94 points lower than the educated group (p = 0.046). In addition, every 10,000 Thai Baht (approximately 330 United States dollars) increase in family income correlated with 1.58 increase in FSIQ (p = 0.047). Conclusion Cognitive dysfunction was commonly found in children with CKD. Socioeconomic factors, particularly school attendance and family income, were associated with cognitive dysfunction. Cognitive evaluation is suggested for children with CKD who have socioeconomic risk factors.",

Previous studies revealed that children with moderate to severe CKD, including children with CKD stage 5 treated by kidney transplant (KT), had lower cognitive function than siblings and healthy children [4] [5] [6] . Central nervous system (CNS) abnormalities have been reported in children with CKD stage 5 and can affect cognitive function [7] . Approximately 12-23% of children with CKD stage 5, which includes those treated with dialysis and KT, have cerebral atrophy [7] . Furthermore, a recent study in Canada [8] demonstrated that 21% of children with CKD had cerebral white matter abnormalities on brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In addition to structural CNS abnormalities, several clinical and socioeconomic factors could affect cognitive function.",

Several potential clinical risk factors for cognitive dysfunction in children with CKD have been reported, such as greater CKD severity, younger age at kidney disease onset, hypertension, increased blood pressure variability (BPV), proteinuria, anemia, and depression [6, [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] . In addition, genetic factors might increase the risk for neurocognitive dysfunction in children with CKD, especially if kidney disease has a clear relationship with a genetic disorder [14] . Children with mild or moderate CKD are also at risk of neurodevelopmental problems [10] . In addition to clinical risk factors, a relationship between low socioeconomic status and cognitive impairment was observed in adults with CKD stage 5D treated with hemodialysis [15, 16] , but data from children are limited.",

In this study, the median FSIQ was lower, at 83.0 (71.0-95.0). One possible explanation is that most of the children (76.8%) in the previous report had mild to moderate CKD, and only 23.2% of the children were receiving KRT. In contrast, higher numbers of children in this study (37.8%) were receiving KRT. In addition, the difference may be related to environmental effects or possibly the low socioeconomic status of children in this study. Consistent with a previous report [1] , children in this study had lower scores in the verbal, visual, and executive function domains. However, the U.S. versions of the WISC-V and WAIS-III were used in this study. The tests used an IQ measure normalized in the U.S., therefore, the tests cannot rule out the possibility that cognitive functioning skewed low because of the cultural bias of the WISC and WAIS. Previous studies of FSIQ measurement in Thai children have been reported, but they used the Thai version of the WISC-III [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] . The mean FSIQ using the Thai version of the WISC-III was 93-96, 97, 90, and 79 in healthy children, liver transplant recipients, children with a history of preterm birth, and children with prenatally-acquired human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), respectively [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] .",

Additionally, there was an association between lower education attainment and adverse health outcomes in adults with CKD [36] . Consistent with previous studies of adults [15, 16, 36] , children who left school and a low family income were associated with low cognitive function in this study. A review by Groothoff et al. [37] revealed that children with CKD stage 5D and KRT had significantly lower cognitive function in adulthood and a lower level of education attainment than children in the control group. Consistent with this hypothesis, the FSIQ of the group of children who had left school was 12.94 points lower than that of the currently educated group. This could be because the currently uneducated children lacked participation in proper cognition-promoting activities that tend to occur at school. Although education at public schools is free for Thai children until grade 9, the main reasons for school dropout in this study were falling behind academically after frequent school absences, frequent hospital visits, traveling difficulty due to physical disabilities and parental concerns regarding their child's health. This study is the first report in a developing country to demonstrate that low family income was associated with low cognitive function. Every 10,000 THB (approximately 330 USD) increase in family income was correlated with a 1.58-point increase in the FSIQ in the present study. Previous studies in children with CKD [6, 10] demonstrated relationships between maternal education and cognitive dysfunction. Low main caregiver education was not related to cognitive dysfunction in the present study, although low main caregiver education was significantly associated with a 13.13-point lower FSIQ score in the univariable linear regression analysis. However, it did not maintain statistical significance in multivariable linear regression analysis.",

First, this is the first report in a developing country to assess cognitive function in children with CKD, revealing a high prevalence of below-average cognitive function in children with CKD. Children in developing countries have different socioeconomic statuses from those in developed countries. Many of them have several risks that affect cognitive function, such as poor health, malnutrition, lack of education, and lack of stimulation at home. Therefore, these results expand on those in the literature. Second, this study is homogenous in terms of cognitive assessment because the same tool was used for all children. Third, this study identified socioeconomic risk factors associated with low cognitive function, especially low family income, which had not been reported in prior pediatric studies in developing countries. Our study also has several limitations. First, relatively few patients were included in this study, which limited the statistical analysis of risk factors of interest. However, this is only one of a few studies that assessed full cognitive function and socioeconomic risk factors in children with CKD, especially in a developing country. Second, there was a potential for significant selection bias due to the number of eligible participants who chose not to participate. Sixty-two children who met the inclusion criteria declined to participate due to awareness of the risks of COVID-19, which was a potential selection bias; perhaps more educated parents or those with a higher income were more aware of the risks of COVID-19 and had a higher rate of declining, or perhaps children with more transportation or resource barriers were less likely to participate. Third, the cross-sectional design did not allow the evaluation of changes in cognitive function over time. Fourth, this study included diverse CKD stages, from mild to moderate CKD to KRT, so the results were not specific to a certain group. Additionally, we were unable to perform subgroup analysis due to the small patient numbers. Fifth, the U.S. versions of the WISC-V and WAIS-III were used in this study. The tests used an IQ measure normalized for the U.S. population, and this study did not include a healthy, unaffected control group with which to assess the effect of using the tests; therefore, the tests cannot exclude the possibility that cognitive functioning skewed low because of the cultural bias of the WISC-V and WAIS-III. Therefore, further prospective longitudinal studies to compare cognitive function over time and increased sample sizes are required to validate the findings of this study.",

The prevalence of below-average cognitive function (FSIQ <90) was 64.9% (24 children), and 24.3% (9 children) were considered to have a cognitive impairment (FSIQ <70). Regarding the cognitive domains, the median scores were within the average range (FSIQ 90-109). Interestingly, most children (94.6%) had belowaverage FSIQ (FSIQ <90) scores in at least one cognitive domain. Additionally, approximately half of the children (45.9%) had scores indicating cognitive impairment (FSIQ <70) in at least one cognitive domain. A subgroup analysis was performed to investigate the association between KRT and cognitive function. Fourteen children who underwent KRT were analyzed. Of these children, 8 underwent KT, and 6 were on chronic dialysis. The median FSIQs of children in the chronic dialysis group and the KT group were 84.0 (71.9-87.8) and 70.5 (64.0-89.3), respectively, and there was no statistically significant difference between the two groups (p = 0.35).",
