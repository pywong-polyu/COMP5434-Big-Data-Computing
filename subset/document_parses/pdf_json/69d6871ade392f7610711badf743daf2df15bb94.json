Stimulation of the cold-sensitive receptors activates efferent responses relayed via the hypothalamus that reduce heat loss and increase heat production. These responses include reducing blood flow to the peripheries and increasing heat production by mechanisms including shivering.

This activation leads to production of pyrogenic cytokines including interleukin (IL)-1\u02c7, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u02db. These pyrogenic cytokines act on an area of the brain known as the organum vasculosum of the laminae terminalis (OVLT) leading to the release of prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2 ) via activation of the enzyme cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-2). PGE 2 binds to receptors in the hypothalamus leading to an increase in heat production and a decrease in heat loss until the temperature in the hypothalamus reaches a new, elevated, set-point. Once the new set-point is attained, the hypothalamus maintains homeostasis around this new set-point by the same mechanisms involved in the regulation of normal body temperature. However, in addition, there are a number of important specific negative feedback systems in place that prevent excessive elevation of body temperature. One key system is the glucocorticoid system, which acts via nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-\u00c4B) and activator protein-1 (AP-1). Both these mediators have anti-inflammatory properties and downregulate the production of pyrogenic cytokines, such as IL-1\u02c7, IL-6, and TNF-\u02db. The febrile response is further modulated by specific antipyretic cytokines including IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1RA), IL-10, and TNF-\u02dbbinding protein.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "The Cellular and Molecular Basis of the Febrile Response"}, {"text": "The negative feedback systems outlined above are not the only mechanisms that exist to protect cells from being damaged by the febrile response. In addition, the heat shock proteins (HSPs) provide intrinsic resistance to thermal damage. Genes encoding the HSPs probably first evolved more than 2.5 billion years ago. They represent an important system providing protection to cells, not only against extremes of temperature, but also against other potentially lethal stresses including toxic chemicals and radiation injury. During heat-stress, transcription and translation of HSPs is upregulated. HSPs can then trigger refolding of heat-damaged proteins preserving them until heat-stress has passed or, if necessary, can transport denatured proteins to organelles for intracellular degradation. As well as providing protection against cellular damage from the thermal stress induced by fever, the HSPs may themselves be important regulators of the febrile response. For example, HSP 70 inhibits pyrogenic cytokine production via NF-\u00c4B.

This is potentially important because dendritic cells act as the key antigen presenting cells in the immune system. Human neutrophil cell motility and phagocytosis are enhanced by temperatures in the febrile range, and growth of intracellular bacteria in human macrophages in vitro is reduced by temperatures in the febrile range compared to normal temperatures. Murine macrophages demonstrate a range of enhanced functions at temperatures in the febrile range. These effects include enhanced expression of the Fc receptors that are involved in mediating antibody responses, and enhanced phagocytosis. Temperatures in the physiological febrile range enhance binding of human lymphocytes to the vascular endothelium. This L-selectin-mediated binding is important in facilitating lymphocyte migration to sites of tissue inflammation or infection. In mice, T lymphocyte-mediated killing of virus-infected cells is increased by temperatures in the febrile range and helper T-cell potentiation of antibody responses is enhanced. In contrast to other cells of the immune system, the cytotoxic activity of natural killer cells is reduced by temperatures in the febrile range compared to normal body temperature.

The susceptibility of a pathogen to heat may have significance in terms of its pathogenicity in a particular host.

As COX catalyzes the generation of prostaglandins from arachidonic acid, this suggests that the pivotal role of PGE 2 in the regulation of the thermostatic set-point may be preserved in these species as well as in higher animals. Such a common biochemical mechanism to regulate fever across such a diverse group of animals raises the possibility that the febrile response may have evolved in a common ancestor. If this is the case, then fever probably emerged as an evolutionary response more than 350 million years ago [13] . As the febrile response comes at a significant metabolic cost [4, 5] , its persistence across such a broad range of species provides strong circumstantial evidence that the response has some evolutionary advantage.

This observation led Julius Wagner-Jauregg to propose, in 1887, that inoculation of malaria might be a justifiable therapy for patients with 'progressive paralysis'. His rationale was that one could substitute an untreatable condition for a treatable one -malaria being treatable with quinine. In 1917, he tested his hypothesis in nine patients with paralysis due to syphilis by injecting them with blood from patients suffering from malaria. Three of the patients had remission of their paralysis. This led to further experiments and clinical observations on more than a thousand patients with remission occurring in 30 % of patients with neurosyphilis-related progressive paralysis 'treated' with fever induced by malaria compared to spontaneous remission rates of only 1 %. This work on fever therapy led to Julius Wagner-Jauregg being awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1927 [25] .

This study had other major limitations including a lack of blinding or placebo-control, and potential confounding from the uncontrolled use of other antipyretic drugs and per-protocol use of external cooling.

The conservation of a metabolically costly response across a broad range of animal species suggests that the response probably has an evolutionary advantage. There are some interesting historical examples of hyperthermia being employed to treat infectious diseases. However, in the modern era the relevance of these examples is questionable. Furthermore, arguments based on the evolutionary importance of the febrile response do not necessarily apply to critically ill patients who are, by definition, supported beyond the limits of normal physiological homeostasis. Humans are not adapted to critical illness. In the absence of modern medicine and intensive care, most critically ill patients with fever and infection would presumably die. Among critically ill patients, it is biologically plausible that there is a balance to be struck between the potential benefits of reducing metabolic rate that come with fever control and the potential risks of a deleterious effect on host defense mechanisms. Remarkably, at present, we do not know what effect treating fever in critically ill patients with infections has on patient-centered outcomes.
