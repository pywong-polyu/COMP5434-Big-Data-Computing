Here, we investigated the stability of SARS-CoV-2 in 32 liquids including common beverages, bodily fluids, and commonly used viral transport media. Our results showed that the infectious virus could be recovered up to 77-days from common beverages including milk and water. Viral RNA could be detected at high levels in all samples up to 28-days, indicating that while viral RNA demonstrates higher stability than infectivity, viral RNA levels do not reflect the infectious capability of SARS-CoV-2. These results indicate that SARS-CoV-2 is highly stable in optimal conditions and a sufficient control measure is needed in reducing the risk of exposure and controlling and preventing future outbreaks.",

SARS-CoV-2 can survive in suspension and in aerosols in the environment for a limited time and the virus is very stable in favorable environments (Chin et al., 2020) . At refrigeration temperatures (4 \u2022 C), SARS-CoV-1 remains infectious up to 9 days (Rabenau et al., 2005) . In a transportation medium, there was a limited reduction in infectious SARS-CoV-2 held at 4 \u2022 C for up to 14 days (Chin et al., 2020) . In this context, SARS-CoV-2 remained infectious for 3 weeks in spiked pieces of refrigerated chicken, pork, and salmon (Fisher et al., 2020) . In industrial production, SARS-CoV-2 RNA has been detected in dairy products, including milk powder and ice cream, leading to disruptions in the food supply chain (Liew, 2021) . While the persistence of viral RNA on surfaces and in food could contribute to potential positive test results, a robust risk evaluation should include an assay that is capable of differentiating between infectious and non-infectious virions. To date, there have been limited studies on viral infectivity in common beverages and bodily fluids. In this context, the evaluation of virus stability together with infectivity in commonly available beverages are of high importance to the risk assessment of outbreak control and prevention.",

While laborious compared to the RT-PCR method, virus titration by using cell culture is the most direct method for the evaluation of virus infectivity. In this study, the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 in 32 commercial beverage and bodily fluids was quantitated by using RT-PCR and a conventional plaque assay by cell culture; tested for infectivity up to 77 days after incubation, the aim was to evaluate the stability and infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 in liquid suspension.",

Infection assay using SARS-CoV-2 was performed in the BSL-3 facility at the Institute of Tropical Medicine, Nagasaki University. In this study, 50 \u00b5L of virus culture (2 \u00d7 10 6 PFU/mL) was inoculated into 950 \u00b5L of the liquid sample (final virus concentration was 1 \u00d7 10 5 PFU/mL) and incubated at 4 \u2022 C. In clinical samples, the infectious virus was isolated from the nasopharyngeal swabs of COVID 19 patients at titers between 10 5 PFU/mL to 10 7 PFU/mL (Lescure, 2020) , suggesting that virus shedding occurs between these levels during natural infection. Thus, the liquid samples in this study were spiked at concentrations that show virus shedding during natural infection at a titer of 2 \u00d7 10 6 PFU/mL of virus (final concentration: 1 \u00d7 10 5 PFU/mL). Briefly, SARS-CoV-2 spiked liquid samples were incubated at 4 \u2022 C were collected at each time point and serially diluted in the EMEM (dilution ratio of 1:10-1:10 3 ). A total of 100 \u00b5L of serially diluted sample was inoculated onto monolayers of Vero cells in a 12-well plate. Next, the plates were incubated at 37 \u2022 C in 5% CO 2 up to 40 min, and, after incubation, 2 mL of overlay media [5 g of Methylcellulose (Wako Pure Chemical Industries Ltd., Osaka, Japan), 12 g of Avicel RC 591 (FMC Biopolymer, United States), and 9.4 g of EMEM powder were dissolved in 1 L of DDW] was added to each well.

Infectious virus and viral RNA were detected by plaque assay and qRT-PCR, respectively. The infectious virus value was represented as a plaque forming unit (PFU)/mL. Infectious virus could be recovered between day 7 to day 35 from some beverages, including milk, fruit juices, alcoholic beverages (alcohol content < 16%), and water, and bodily fluids (saliva and urine, Table 1) . Of the 32 samples tested, in four liquid samples, infectious virus particles could be detected up to day 77 of the incubation time point. Retention of viral infectivity varied according to the type of beverage and the incubation time (day 0, Table 1 ). There was a more than 10-fold reduction in the infectious titer in the 28 types of liquid samples tested. Overall, virus infectivity was reduced in most of the samples tested but remained infectious in 15/32 (46.9%), 14/32 (43.7%), and 11/32 (34.4%) of the samples tested at 14, 21, and 28 days, respectively. In this context, there was no significant reduction in SARS-CoV-2 infectious virus titers in common beverages, including milk and soy milk samples, up to day 28 of incubation ( Table 1 ).

            "text": "Our data showed that SARS-CoV-2 infectivity was stable in commonly consumed beverages and bodily fluids at optimal storage conditions. These results demonstrated virus stability even in beverages with significant alcohol content, such as Japanese wine sake (15.6% of alcohol content). While there has been little evidence of the isolation of SARS-CoV-2 from sewage water, infectious virus was detected in spiked tap water and bodily fluids up to 2-months after incubation in which their half-life values were between 4.0 and 52.7 days ( Table 3) , indicating prolonged virus stability in drinking water and possibly wastewater. Viral RNA could still be detected at high levels in samples that did not demonstrate infectivity, concurring with that of previous studies that viral RNA levels do not reflect infectivity. Of note, in a similar experiment using a dengue virus (Supplementary Table 1) , no infectious particles were detected after inoculation in all of the spikedalcoholic beverage samples. Infectious SARS-CoV-2 could still be detected for the length of the experiment, of up to 77 days, in common beverages, including water and milk. While SARS-CoV-2 suspended in water, milk, and soy milk remained infectious up to day 77 of refrigeration, infectious virus particles were not detected in acidic beverages (fruit juices, cola, vinegar drink, and white wine) by day 7 after refrigeration. Of note, infectious virus particles were not detected in tea beverages immediately after incubation, indicating the presence of active compounds that may hamper SARS-CoV-2 infectivity in vitro. In all, the study provided insights into SARS-CoV-2 infectivity in common commercial beverages, with the longest follow-up period to date being 77 days, and it also demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 has great stability in a range of environmental conditions. While plaque assay is laborious and requires high-level biosafety containment (BSL-3 facility), additional means of monitoring, including quantification of viral proteins by mass spectrometry (Gouveia et al., 2020) , may be useful as proxies for infectious virus particles, and will be complementary in monitoring virus infectivity and potential risks.

In this context, the possible risk of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) transmission in contaminated milk has been suggested previously (van Doremalen et al., 2014) . While, SARS-CoV-2 RNA has been detected in beverages and biological samples including urine of some patients Wu et al., 2020; Xiao et al., 2020) , there is limited evidence of transmission by SARS-CoV-2 through food consumption or fecal-oral transmission (Xiao et al., 2020) . As human gut enterocytes have been reported to be permissive to the replication of SARS-CoV-2 (Lamers et al., 2020) , these studies imply that further studies would be needed to determine virus transmissibility through the fecal-oral route. Viral transmission may be affected by various environmental factors, including temperature, humidity, and route of transmission (Chin et al., 2020; Ratnesar-Shumate et al., 2020; Ren et al., 2020) . Additionally, with the current industry standards for food manufacturing (Anelich, 2020) , the risk of food contamination through exposure to contaminated products and contamination",
