            "text": "Concerns about the safety and side effects of coronavirus SARS CoV2 vaccines have been raised among many communities worldwide. The aim of this study was to describe the side effects reported by vaccinated individuals in Jordan. A cross-sectional survey was used to recruit responses from participants who were vaccinated with either one dose or both doses of any of the administered vaccines in Jordan (AstraZeneca, Pfizer, Sinopharm). A total of 1,086 participants were enrolled in the study. Most of participants have not been infected with SARS CoV2 before receiving the vaccine (77.2%). Larger proportion of the study population received Pfizer vaccine (40.6%) followed by the AstraZeneca vaccine (33.0%), and Sinopharm vaccine (26.4%). Side effects after receiving the first dose of the vaccine were reported by most participants (89.9%) and included pain at the injection site (78.4%), fatigue (51.8%), myalgia (37.6%), headache (33.1%), and chills (32.3%). To a lesser extent, there were gastrointestinal side effects such as nausea (15.1%), loss of appetite (9.4%), and diarrhea (6.4%). More side effects were significantly associated with AstraZeneca vaccine (P < .001). Only one case for each of second dose of Pfizer and Sinopharm vaccines reported that their side effects required hospitalization. In this study, we found that people in Jordan experienced more side effects with AstraZeneca vaccine followed by Pfizer vaccine and the least one is Sinopharm vaccine. Our study showed that these side effects are not severe and should not be an obstacle against the successful control of the pandemic in Jordan.",

Since its emergence in December 2019, it caused a global humanitarian crisis; affecting health, economy, and education in addition to other challenges. 1 In the wake of the pandemic, most of the countries including Jordan have imposed protective measures such as wearing masks, distancing, stay-at-home-strategy, and lockdown, but these measures are not going to persist. Therefore, in order to manage, reduce, and eradicate COVID-19 infection, therapeutic and preventative solutions are required. Regarding pharmacologic therapy for SARS-CoV-2, studies on the use of preexisting medications (e.g., hydroxychloroquine and remdesivir) for the treatment of COVID-19 were contradictory and did not confirm a conclusion. 2, 3 This highlighted the need for specific antivirals against SARS-COV-2 to be developed and authorized to control the pandemic. 4 In terms of preventative measures, population immunity is needed to be achieved once the disease has spread to become a pandemic. 5 However, waiting for natural population immunity through infection with the virus to achieve herd immunity is not No vaccine is totally free from any side effects or complications. 16 Early side effects either local ones like pain, redness, and swelling, or the systemic ones like headache, nausea, tiredness, myalgia, chills, fever are expected with any vaccines. 17 However, there may be other serious side effects such as anaphylaxis to a vaccine component, which was reported to be secondary to allergic reactions to polyethylene glycol (PEG). 18 In addition, blood clotting events were suggested to be caused secondary to the administration COVID-19 vaccines including AstraZeneca, Pfizer, and Moderna vaccines. 19, 20 Side effects of vaccines may be reported through the government's reporting systems such as the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) in the US and Yellow card in the UK. 21, 22 In Jordan, people who received the vaccine are encouraged to report any observed side effects to the Ministry of Health's platform through the link included in the SMS received upon registration. 23 However, the purpose of reporting is to assure the safety of the vaccinated person rather than providing an early warning about the safety of the vaccine or if it may require further investigation. 23 Therefore, in this study we aimed to identify vaccine side effects reported among Jordanian population who have received one of the earliest administered vaccines (Pfizer, AstraZeneca, and Sinopharm) in Jordan.",

(2020) study with the administration of AstraZeneca vaccine. 17, 31 Although with lower proportions than those observed with Pfizer or AstraZeneca vaccines administration, local symptoms were also the most common reported symptom with the administration of Sinopharm vaccine. This is consistent with the findings of Henan Province randomized controlled clinical trial that included 320 healthy participants who aged 18-59 years, where injection site pain was the complaint of 14 of 96 participant (14.5%) and 21 of 224 (9.37%) in phase 1 and phase 2, respectively. 34 Consistent with our findings, fatigue was reported in several studies with the administration with Pfizer or AstraZeneca vaccines. 14, 17, 29, [31] [32] [33] However, higher proportions of those who received Sinopharm vaccine in our study complained from fatigue compared to that observed in Xia et al. (2021) randomized controlled trial. 27 This is also consistent with the findings of Wu et al (2021) recent review of 87 publications with safety data from clinical trials and post-authorization studies of 19 COVID-19 vaccines. 35 Gastrointestinal symptoms, particularly nausea, were reported in 23.% of those who received AstraZeneca vaccine with lower proportions observed with the administration of Pfizer vaccine in two cross sectional studies (15.94% and 13.0%) and one randomized trial with the administration of Sinopharm vaccine (1%). [27] [28] [29] 33 This trend was also observed in our study, though with higher proportions observed for AstraZeneca and Sinopharm vaccines and lower proportions with Pfizer vaccine. Nausea incidence in our study was also consistent with that observed in the WHO report with the administration of AstraZeneca vaccine. 32 Other reported systemic reactions were fever and chills, which were higher in incidence in our study than that reported in a prospective observational study conducted in the UK with the administration of AstraZeneca vaccine. 26 Furthermore, headache was observed among half of those who received either AstraZeneca or Pfizer vaccines. 28, 29, 33 In fact, headache was the most prominent side effect of Pfizer vaccine in a real time analysis. 36 However, these findings were consistent with ours for AstraZeneca but not Pfizer vaccines. These discrepancies may be attributed to population differences or methodologies used for reporting observed symptoms.",

Other reported neurological manifestations were considered rare in Kadali et al (2021) study with the administration of Pfizer vaccine. 33 Furthermore, higher proportions of psychological symptoms were observed in our population compared to that reported in Kadali et al (2021) study with less than 1% prevalence of stress and depression. 33 Our study revealed that most of the symptoms were not severe to require hospitalization with the administration of either Pfizer or AstraZeneca vaccines and the duration of symptoms were only for few days after vaccination. The same trend was reported in several studies with most side effects were mild to moderate in severity and usually resolve within few days after vaccination. 14, 31, 32, 36 ",

Despite, online web-based questionnaires were found to be cost effective method that represent e1981086-6 total population and have the ability to reach people who are difficult to be reached. 38, 39 In fact, the availability of inexpensive wireless services in Jordan enhanced the use of smartphones that reached 90.3% of the population. 40, 41 This would facilitate the access to social media platforms that were progressively used particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic among Jordanian population as a source of information. 42 Furthermore, age is less likely to affect our results particularly as social media, mainly Facebook, has also been found to enable elderly population to compensate for the lack of face-to-face contact during the pandemic. 43 Moreover, this method of data collection, provides safe and private environment for the participants to answer precisely and truthfully in comparison with face-to-face interactions. 39 Unfortunately, there is no published data that reflects the number of who received the vaccine by gender since the start of vaccination campaign in Jordan 44 nor on the proportion of each vaccine used in the Jordanian population to assess the representativeness of our sample. However, this is less likely to affect our results particularly as the sample size is relatively large when compared to vaccinated population at time of data collection. Besides, the questionnaire was delivered in Arabic language to provide better interpretation. However, the survey was done very soon after starting vaccination in Jordan, therefore, responses regarding delayed symptoms may not have been reported.",
