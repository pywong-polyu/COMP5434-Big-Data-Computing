While many psychological interventions exist for those who have experienced potentially traumatic events, there remains controversy about the best ways to support them. Objective: This review explores the effect of brief psychoeducational interventions after potentially traumatic experiences on adult recipients' mental health, attitudes towards mental health, and trauma-related knowledge, as well as the perceived acceptability of psychoeducation. Methods: Four electronic databases were searched for relevant published literature. Results: Ten papers were included in the review. There was no evidence that psychoeducation was any more effective in terms of reducing mental health symptoms than other interventions or no intervention at all. There was some evidence that psychoeducation improved attitudes towards and knowledge of mental health immediately post-intervention; one study examined whether these improvements were sustained over the long term and found that they were not. However, psychoeducation was generally highly regarded by participants. Conclusions: This review did not find sufficient evidence to support routine use of brief psychoeducation as a stand-alone intervention.",

Many people will experience at least one PTE within their lifetime (Ogle, Rubin, Berntsen, & Siegler, 2013) ; the Adult Psychiatric Morbidity Survey (Fear, Bridges, Hatch, Hawkins, & Wessely, 2014) suggests that about a third of adults in the UK have experienced at least one. Experiencing a PTE can be distressing in the short term and, while the majority of people will not go on to develop mental health problems (Bonanno, 2004) , a minority may develop longerterm mental health consequences including posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression and anxiety (Neria, Nandi, & Galea, 2008) . Prevention, early detection, and treatment of psychological difficulties following a PTE are important in minimizing the mental health consequences of such events (Brooks & Greenberg, in press) .",

One commonly used example of such an intervention is psychoeducation. This involves the provision of information allowing participants to learn about 'normal' psychological responses to PTEs and enhancing understanding of stress reactions, for the purpose of reducing the potential negative impacts of trauma. It usually also includes information on seeking further help (Whitworth, 2016) . Psychoeducation can be delivered in multiple ways, including face-to-face sessions either individually or as a group, or provision of educational booklets, websites, or smartphone apps. Howard and Goelitz (2004) suggest it may also encourage help-seeking by reducing the stigma surrounding mental health. The provision of psychoeducation to improve mental health after trauma is based on the assumptions that people will find post-traumatic symptoms to be less disturbing if they have already been given information about them; that they will be reassured by the knowledge that such symptoms are normal; that understanding the nature of symptoms will encourage help-seeking in cases where symptoms are extreme or long-lasting; that psychoeducation could help people adapt by introducing corrective information that modifies their perception of themselves or the event; and that the self-help guidance provided in psychoeducation will be empowering (Wessely et al., 2008) .",

Southwick, Friedman, and Krystal (2008) point out that psychoeducation is framed differently across the literature, sometimes meaning distribution of self-help materials and sometimes including debriefing. We pointed out that psychoeducation is often deemed to be 'so obviously a good thing' (Wessely et al., 2008) so that providing evidence of its effectiveness is rarely seen as a priority and argued that further research is needed to ascertain whether psychoeducation is helpful. Furthermore, we suggested that psychoeducation might cause harm by heightening anxiety or providing too much information and triggering an effect similar to the nocebo effect, in which participants expect to experience adverse effects and consequently do so.",

Interventions could be included if they involved aspects other than psychoeducation (e.g. relaxation exercises) but only if psychoeducation made up at least 50% of the intervention. We included studies testing psychoeducation only, studies comparing psychoeducation to other interventions and studies comparing psychoeducation to treatment-as-usual/control groups. Titles of all studies were screened for relevance by one author (SKB); following this, abstracts were screened and any clearly not meeting the inclusion criteria were excluded.

In a study comparing 52 psychoeducation participants to 51 controls and 54 who received debriefing, Rose et al. (1999) found that all groups improved over eleven months in terms of mental health symptoms, but there were no between-group differences. Ehlers et al. (2003) found that the participants receiving cognitive therapy (n = 28) showed significantly better mental health outcomes than the psychoeducation participants (n = 28) at post-treatment and sixmonth follow-up. Bugg et al. (2008) found significant improvements overall on measures of anxiety, depression and PTSD over 6 months, but no differences were found between a group who received psychoeducation (n = 36) and a group who received psychoeducation plus writing exercises (n = 31); additionally, no significant improvements in quality of life were found for either group. Wijesinghe et al. (2015) found that, after 6 months, 13.8% of 65 participants who received psychoeducation showed psychiatric symptoms of anxiety and depression: this was more than the 8.7% of 69 participants who received psychoeducation plus a cognitive behavioural intervention, but less than the 26.5% of 68 controls. The rate of severe depression was significantly higher in controls than in both other groups. Prevalence of PTSD was highest (12.3%) in psychoeducation participants, compared to 2.9% in the group who received psychoeducation plus cognitive behavioural treatment, and 10.3% in controls; the difference between the psychoeducation and control groups was not statistically significant. Assessments completed at baseline (within 1-month post-injury) and 3-and 6-months post-injury 3 months post-intervention, participants asked to rate usefulness of intervention PTSD, anxiety and depression decreased across time but there were no group differences in these measures or quality of life. However, subjective ratings of the usefulness of the self-help booklet were very high. Participants from the intervention group were asked to rate sections of the booklet on a scale of 1 (not useful) to 5 (extremely useful). Out of 60 completers, 52 rated the section on psychological sequelae, resulting in a mean rating of 3.60 (SD = 0.87), with 94.23% rating it 3 or above and 51.92% rating it 'very' or 'extremely' useful. Fifty participants rated the section on coping strategies, resulting in a mean rating of 3.70 (SD = 0.89); 94% rated it 3 or above, with 60% rating it 'very' or 'extremely' useful. Immediately after viewing the video, participants exhibited greater knowledge of PTSD symptoms and more positive beliefs about mental health treatment than those in the wound care condition. At 1-month follow-up, however, these differences were no longer maintained. No significant differences in PTSD were found between the intervention and control groups. Differences in self-recognition of PTSD nearly reached significance with psychoeducation participants being more likely to recognize symptoms as mental health problems.",

There was a reduction in PTSD caseness within the control (50% of 67) compared with the intervention (20% of 75) group which was almost significant (p < 0.06). Ehlers et al.

Wong et al. (2013) found that, immediately after viewing the psychoeducational video, participants exhibited greater knowledge of PTSD symptoms than controls. Controlling for PTSD symptoms, participants in the psychoeducation condition were also more likely to endorse self-recognition of PTSD problems immediately postintervention than controls (p = 0.05). At the 1-month follow-up, group differences in PTSD knowledge were no longer maintained, but differences in self-recognition of PTSD between groups narrowly failed to reach significance, with psychoeducation intervention participants being more likely to recognize their symptoms as mental health problems than controls.",

Our results do not overall suggest negative effects of psychoeducation with only one of 10 papers reviewed (Turpin et al., 2005) finding that a psychoeducation group fared less well than the control group. However, whilst there was some evidence that psychoeducation recipients reported some increase in knowledge immediately postintervention and generally liked the information provided, we could find no conclusive evidence that psychoeducation led to a sustained improvement in mental health outcomes after traumatic events. Fortunately, most people exposed to trauma do recover naturally, without the need for any formal intervention (Bonanno, 2004 ). Psychoeducation appears to add little or nothing to this, although the tendency for participants to endorse psychoeducation suggests that they may attribute symptom improvement to the intervention.",

Psychoeducation certainly has face validity with the public -for example in a study of students (Tarrier, Liversidge, & Gregg, 2006) , psychoeducation was highly endorsed (the fourth highest-rated intervention for PTSD, out of 14). This is also shared by professionalsa study of European Union professionals on the suitability of Dutch guidelines for disaster response (Brake & D\u00fcckers, 2013) found that 77% (of 116 participants) were in favour of psychoeducation. However, despite being viewed positively by participants, we found insufficient evidence to conclude that psychoeducation as a stand-alone intervention is effective in preventing or reducing mental health symptoms. Indeed, the recent NICE guidelines for the management of PTSD (NICE, 2018) notes that the evidence base for psychoeducation is 'very limited and uncertain' and insufficient to recommend psychoeducation for use on its own. We also note that previous high-quality studies of psychological debriefing concluded that in spite of those who were debriefed reporting high levels of satisfaction with the debriefing process, they nonetheless did not improve and indeed some experienced a deterioration in their mental health (Rose, Bisson, Churchill, & Wessely, 2002) . Thus, satisfaction with an intervention is not a useful metric to measure effectiveness.",

While interventions including psychoeducation as just one component may be effective, it is difficult to ascertain how much of their success is due to the psychoeducation aspect. Additionally, it is difficult to ascertain the extent to which psychoeducation is responsible for any improvements in mental health symptoms, attitudes or knowledges because researchers cannot control for other information participants might seek out or knowledge they may already have been exposed to (Robertson, Humphreys, & Ray, 2004; Whitworth, 2016) .",

As such, we do not know for certain that the psychoeducation interventions were really administered as intended. Additionally, although we included only studies which provided psychoeducation as an intervention following a single traumatic incident, it is possible that some participants may have also experienced other traumatic incidents which may have affected their symptoms.
