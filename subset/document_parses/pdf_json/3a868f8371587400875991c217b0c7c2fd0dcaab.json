Echinococcus granulosus is the most widespread species of the genus Echinococcus that can develop cysts in different parts of the body. We tried to present a case of pulmonary cystic echinococcosis. Methods Here, we report a rare case of two ruptured and intact cysts in a 54-year-old woman with weakness, lethargy, body pain, stomachache, dizziness, and vision problems. Results According to the patient's manifestations and imaging findings, besides the COVID-19 pandemic, she was suspected of having COVID-19 and tuberculosis. However, when the aspirated sample was stained, hooklets of E. granulosus were observed. Surgical removal and chemotherapy were used for treatment. Conclusion Treatment of pulmonary cystic echinococcosis is based on surgery, but, along with it, the chemotherapy makes a better prognosis.",

The PEC rupture can occur in the bronchus and/or pleural cavity. This rupture can result in the development of pleural effusion, pleural CE, allergic symptoms, and anaphylaxis, and spread to other lobes through bronchioles [9] . The rupture of PEC into bronchus is a significant complication, producing severe cough, chest pain, fever, and weight loss. Rupture into the pleural or pericardial cavity is a severe and life-threatening condition that can cause many complications, including bronchopleural fistula, primary pneumothorax, pneumothorax, pleural thickening, lung collapse, large residual cavity, and empyema [10, 11] .",
