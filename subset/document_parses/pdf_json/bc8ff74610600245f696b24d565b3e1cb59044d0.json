Nonetheless, in Israel, the recent surge of infections with the highly transmissible Omicron (B.1.1.529) 13,14 variant has led to the January 2, defined for each of the two outcomes separately). Eligible controls were PCR negative individuals who had neither tested positive prior to the date of the positive PCR or the COVIDrelated hospitalization of their matched caseand whose test was not done after administration of the fourth vaccine, if such was administered. A 1:1 matching was performed based on sex, age group (16 to 29 years, 30 to 39 years, 40 to 49 years, 50 to 59 years, and \u2265 60 years), GSA, calendrical week of testing, and the month of receipt of the second dose. The first positive PCR test and the first negative PCR test were the only tests included for each case and control, respectively. All negative PCRs for cases were excluded from the study, therefore an MHS member was either a case or a control, not both. 6 The analysis sought to estimate the reduction in the odds of a positive outcome at different time points following the receipt of the booster dose. Therefore, we stratified the analysis for each month-since-vaccination, where in each stratum matched pairs included only cases that met that specific month since vaccination or the reference group of August 2021vaccinees (hence, the number of matched pairs differed between time points). 6 The vaccination status (and time from inoculation) was determined at the time of the PCR test (for the first outcome assessing breakthrough infections) or the COVID-19 hospitalization (for the second outcome assessing severe disease).",

First, as a sensitivity analysis for the occurrence of a booster breakthrough infection, we repeated the test-negative analysis, this time unmatched allowing individuals to contribute multiple negative tests, but excluding them once they tested positive (further details can be found in Patalon et al). 11 In order to account for repeated sample collection from the same individual, a Generalized Estimating Equation (GEE) logistic regression model was fit to the data. 25 25 Adjustment included demographics and the same comorbidities as the main analysis, in addition to a series of dummy variables representing the calendar week in which the PCR test was performed to address exposure. We assumed an exchangeable correlation structure. In our second sensitivity analysis, we reran the main analysis while including tests that were performed 0 to 6 days after the administration of the fourth dose of the vaccine. The rationale was that if we consider 'fully vaccinated' individuals as those 7 days or more after receiving a fourth dose (similarly to the booster), tests performed within that period should not be excluded. This also allowed us to mitigate a potential selection bias of excluding tests of early vaccinees.",

The main limitation of every observational SARS-CoV-2 study is a potential bias stemming from healthcare related behavior as it pertains to PCR testing. This issue has been discussed in previous studies as well, 7,11,19 and was more of a concern during the past months, in light of changing testing policies in Israel during the Omicron surge, where an overwhelming numbers of infected individuals did not allow the same test-forall policy, implemented in previous waves. The test-negative design, which does not assume that a lack of a positive test equals a negative test and somewhat adjusts for testing volume, attempts to better mitigate this bias and is the reason we chose this method for this analysis., especially Additionally, the August 2021 vaccinees, who served as the comparison group in the main analysis were generally older and correspondingly sicker. This limitation has also been discussed in previous COVID research, as vaccination rollout generally prioritized chronically ill individuals. Nonetheless, our matching and adjustment approach renders residual confounding by indication less likely. Lastly, as the Omicron variant was the dominant variant in Israel during the analysis, the waning effect against other strains could not be evaluated.
