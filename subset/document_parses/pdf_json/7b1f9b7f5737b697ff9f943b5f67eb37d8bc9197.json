For this reason, it is important to have methodological tools that allow a detailed study of their activity and inhibition, combining computational efficiency and accuracy. We here explore the performance of different quantum mechanics/ molecular mechanics methods to explore the inhibition reaction mechanism of the SARS-CoV-2 3CL protease with a hydroxymethyl ketone derivative. We selected two density functional theory (DFT) functionals (B3LYP and M06-2X), two semiempirical Hamiltonians (AM1d and PM6), and two tight-binding DFT methods (DFTB3 and GFN2-xTB) to explore the free energy landscape associated with this reaction. We show that it is possible to obtain an accurate description combining molecular dynamics simulations performed using tight-binding DFT methods and single-point energy corrections at a higher QM description. The use of a computational strategy that provides reliable results at a reasonable computational cost could assist the in silico screening of possible candidates during the design of new drugs directed against cysteine proteases.",

While the former performs the nucleophilic attack, the latter can act as a proton acceptor/donor during the reaction mechanism. The nucleophile is activated after deprotonation that leads to the formation of the thiolate anion. This anion attacks the electrophilic carbon of the reactive bond, while the leaving amino group is protonated, resulting in the cleavage of the peptide bond. This leads to the release of the first reaction product and the formation of a thioester intermediate. The hydrolysis of this complex produces the second reaction product and the recovery of the initial state of the enzyme. Different variants of this basic reaction mechanism have been described for different enzymes. 6\u22128 Main differences are associated with the protonation state of the catalytic dyad (both residues being neutral or forming an ion pair), the participation of the catalytic histidine in the proton transfer from the cysteine to the substrate and the concerted or stepwise nature of the basic steps.",

This virus uses the transcription machinery of infected cells to translate its genomic material in two large polyproteins that must be cleaved to produce functional proteins for the new generation of viruses. This cleavage process is carried out by two cysteine proteases: the main or 3CL protease, in charge of cleaving the polyprotein in 11 of a total of 14 positions, and the papain-like protease (PPL). 9 The 3CL protease is an interesting target for the development of inhibitors to be used as antivirals because this enzyme uses a recognition sequence not employed in any of the known human proteases (it cleaves the peptide bond after a Gln residue) and because it is well-conserved among different variants of the virus (the Omicron 3CL protease contains only one mutation, far from the active site, with respect to the wild type presenting similar catalytic properties). 10 Pfizer already announced the development of two inhibitors of the SARS-CoV-2 3CL protease: PF-00835231, a hydroxymethyl ketone derivative, 11 and PF-07321332 (or Nirmatrelvir), a nitrile-derived compound present in Paxlovid (see Figure 2 ). 12 These compounds are peptidomimetics containing a warhead that is able to react with the nucleophilic cysteine, forming a stable acylenzyme complex with the 3CL protease of SARS-CoV-2.

Atomistic details of reactions in cysteine protease reactivity can provide valuable information for the development of efficient and specific covalent inhibitors for them. This knowledge can be obtained from a combination of experimental techniques (such as kinetic and structural studies) and computational approaches. Proper simulations of enzymatic reactions must be carried out, including the interactions of the reactive system with a dynamical environment formed by the protein and the solvent. These simulations are nowadays affordable using hybrid quantum mechanics/ molecular mechanics (QM/MM) approaches, where a small part of the system is described using QM methods, while the rest is treated using MM. 13, 14 The bottleneck in the use of these methodologies is the need to repeat a QM calculation at each step of the simulation, which typically restricts current applications to low-cost QM methods, such as wave-functionbased semiempirical Hamiltonians or density functional theory (DFT) tight-binding descriptions. However, the reaction mechanism of cysteine proteases (see Figure 1 ) involves the deprotonation of a sulfur atom and the nucleophilic attack of the corresponding anion on a carbonyl group, which can compromise the performance of low-cost QM approaches.",

            "text": "In order to analyze the performance of different QM/MM schemes in the analysis of 3CL protease inhibition with PF-00835231, we followed the same computational strategy reported in our previous study. 18 The noncovalent enzyme\u2212 inhibitor (EI) complex was built using the PDB structure 6XHM. 11 Maestro 21 and PROPKA 22 were used for the Hbond assignments and to determine the most likely protonation states of the titratable residues at pH 7.4. Regarding the parameters employed to describe the hydroxymethyl inhibitor, they were obtained by following the nonstandard residue parameterization procedure implemented in Amber using the Antechamber 23 program from the AmberTools18 24 package. The restrained electrostatic potential method 25 using the HF/6-31G* level was used to define the atomic charges of the inhibitor, while the standard residues were described using the ff14SB forcefield. 26 The necessary information required to carry out the simulations with the PF-00835231 inhibitor can be found in Supporting Information (frcmod and prepin files). The system was formed by the EI complex with enough Na + ions to neutralize the electrostatic charge of the system and a water box, in which the solute's closest atom to the boundaries of the box is at a distance of at Journal of Chemical Theory and Computation pubs.acs.org/JCTC Article least 12 \u00c5. For that procedure, the program tleap from the AmberTools18 suite was chosen. The inhibitor was present in both monomers of the enzyme. We first carried out a classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulation of the EI complex. The standard procedure employed to simulate the system started by a series of minimizations using 500 steps of the steepest descent algorithm, followed by steps of the gradient conjugate method. From this minimized structure, the system was heated using a linear ramp from 0 to 300 K. The first 60 K was raised during 10 ps running Sander in CPU, followed by a 100 ps heating ramp from 60 to 300 K using the Amber19 GPU version of pmemd. 27, 28 During this procedure, the heavy atoms of the backbone are restrained using a harmonic restraint with a force constant of 20 kcal mol \u22121 \u00c5 \u22122 . Then, the system was equilibrated in the NPT ensemble (300 K and 1 bar) for 7.5 ns. The Berendsen barostat was used to control the pressure, while the Langevin thermostat was chosen to keep the temperature controlled. During this simulation time, the force constant is decreased every 1.25 from 15 to 0 kcal\u00b7 mol \u22121 \u00c5 \u22122 (in 3 unit steps) until the system runs restraint-free during the last 1.25 ns of the equilibration. Then, the system was simulated for 1 \u03bcs in the NVT ensemble. The SHAKE 29 algorithm was used to constraint the distances of the bonds between heavy atoms and hydrogens. The time step was 2 fs. The electrostatic short-range interactions were evaluated using a 10 \u00c5 cutoff, while the long-range electrostatic interaction was evaluated using the particle mesh Ewald. 30, 31 To study the reaction for the formation of the covalent EI complex, a QM/MM description was employed. In these calculations, the B3LYP 32,33 and M062X 34 functionals with a 6-31+G* basis set and D3 dispersion corrections 35 were selected to describe the QM region at the DFT level. 36, 37 PM6 38 Hamiltonian was selected among wave function semiempirical descriptions, while GFN2-xTB 39 and DFTB3 40 methods were used as DFT tight-binding methods. The Sander\u2212Gaussian interface 41 was employed to run the QM/ MM simulations using a modified version of the Amber-Tools18 code 42, 43 with Gaussian16 44 to perform the DFT calculations. The QM region included the side chain of the residues in the catalytic dyad (His41 and Cys145), backbone of residue P1, and the hydroxymethyl P1' fragment of the inhibitor. The boundary between the QM/MM regions was described using the link atom approach. For all the QM\u2212MM interactions, the cutoff radius used was 15 \u00c5.",

For this reason, we selected a methodology that help us to explore the associated multidimensional free energy surface (FES). In order to solve the curse of dimensionality, the adaptive string method (ASM) 45 was chosen to find the minimum free energy path (MFEP). In this method, the MFEP can be traced on a multidimensional FES of arbitrary dimensionality defined by a selected set of collective variables (CVs) defined by the bond lengths of all the bonds being formed, broken, or whose formal order changes during the process, as it is the case of the carbonyl bond (see below). Once the MFEP is located, the path is used to define a Path Collective Variable (Path-CV, denoted as s), which is a function that increases monotonically, while the system moves along this path from reactants to products. This makes the Path-CV an adequate reaction coordinate for free energy calculations. As a single reaction coordinate is used, the computational cost is independent of the number of CVs describing the chemical events.",

In our case, the string is formed by a set of 96 replicas of the system (string nodes) evenly separated along the path. Every replica is a QM/MM restrained MD simulation. At every simulation step, each node is moved to a region of a lower energy according to their free energy gradient while keeping them equidistant along the string. This series of steps is repeated until the string converges to its MFEP displaying a RMSD below a 0.1 amu 1/2 \u00c5 for at least 1 ps. Replica exchange attempts between nodes were made every 50 steps to increase the convergence. The converged path was then used to define the reaction coordinate (s) to trace the corresponding reaction free energy profile along the MFEP. For the system in which the QM region was described using a DFT level of theory, every node run for 10 ps and the sampled values were integrated with WHAM 46 to obtain the free energy profile along the Path-CV. For the semiempirical calculations, this integration was made over longer simulation times of 80\u2212100 ps. Details about simulation times and the computational cost of each method are provided in Table S1 . The force constant values employed to bias the ASM simulations were obtained on-the-fly. 45 This help us to obtain a homogeneous probability density distribution of the reaction coordinate. During the string simulations, the masses of the interchanging protons are set equal to 2 amu, and the time step employed was of 1 fs. Because the total length of the reaction coordinate s was different for each QM/MM method, we present the results as a function of a renormalized reaction coordinate (RC = (s \u2212 s min )/(s max \u2212 s min )) that takes values between 0 and 1 in all the cases.",

When a peptide substrate is present, this proton is then transferred directly from His41 to the amino group of the target peptide bond. 8 When an inhibitor is present, its protonation is mediated by a water molecule that occupies the position of the amino group in the natural substrate. 15\u221217 In the case of PF-00835231, the hydroxyl moiety occupies the position of the amino group, and then the proton transfer from His41 to the substrate takes place through the hydroxyl group (see Figure  3 ). 18, 47 The results obtained for the determination of the minimum free energy path (MFEP) for 3CL protease inhibition by PF-00835231 using different descriptions for the QM subsystem are presented in Figure 4 . All of them agree in the timing of the key events during this reaction: the reaction is initiated with the proton abstraction from Cys145 by His41 (resulting in the IP formation), followed by the nucleophilic attack and then the proton transfer from His41 to the carbonyl oxygen atom of the substrate, using the hydroxyl group as a proton shuttle.

            "text": "Both DFT and MM descriptions (using the B3LYP and M06-2X functionals, both with D3 corrections) provide an Journal of Chemical Theory and Computation pubs.acs.org/JCTC Article almost identical geometrical description of the reaction mechanism, as indicated by the evolution of the CVs along the MFEP (see Figure 4c ). Proton transfer from Cys145 to His41 clearly precedes the nucleophilic attack, as reflected in the value of the S\u03b3\u2212C distance, around 2.7 \u00c5 when the proton is at equal distances from the donor and acceptor. The nucleophilic attack is then completed reducing the S\u03b3\u2212C distance below 2 \u00c5, which is followed by the proton transfer from His41 to the inhibitor. Regarding the proton relay mechanism, the proton transfer from the hydroxyl group to the carbonyl oxygen atom slightly precedes the proton transfer from His41 to the hydroxyl group. The main difference between both DFT descriptions is found in the free energy profiles (see Figure 4a ). The M06-2X functional predicts a more stable IP intermediate than B3LYP (7.0 vs 10.7 kcal mol \u22121 , see Table 1 ). In fact, at the B3LYP level, the IP appears as a flat free energy region (see Figure 4a , black line), while at the M06-2X level, the IP is a clear free energy minimum (see Figure 4a , gray line). M06-2X also results in a smaller activation free energy (16.3 vs 19.7 kcal mol \u22121 , see Table 1 ) and a more exergonic process (\u221212.0 vs \u22126.2 kcal mol \u22121 ). The reaction transition state (TS) at the B3LYP level and the ratelimiting TS at the M06-2X level appear with very similar values of the CVs (see Figure 5 ). PDB files with all the TS structures are provided as Supporting Information. At the TS, the S\u03b3\u2212C bond (S\u03b3\u2212C) is almost completely formed, displaying a bond Although the free energy profiles are not dramatically different, it is of interest to discuss the reliability of both functionals to characterize the energetics of the reaction under study. One must consider that we are interested in a multistep process and that it can be difficult to find a functional describing equally well all the steps. The B3LYP functional is one of the best functionals to characterize the energetic of the proton transfer between cysteine and histidine when compared to higher-level electronic structure methods. 48 On the other hand, it is also known that this functional can present problems to describe correctly enolate and carbanion intermediates. 49, 50 However, this limitation is not much important in the system studied because the nucleophilic attack takes place together with the proton transfer from His41 to the substrate. In this case, an enolate is not fully formed since the negative charge is compensated by the incoming proton. In fact, the S\u03b3\u2212C distance presents an almost identical evolution along the MFEP with the two functionals presented here (see Figure 4c ). Our previous results with other inhibitors also indicate that B3LYP correctly describes the nucleophilic attack of a thiolate to a Michael acceptor if this is accompanied by a proton transfer. 15 On the experimental side, there are no direct measurements of the rate constant for the inhibition of 3CL protease with PF-00835231, and then, the experimentally derived activation free energy is not known. However, the free energy barrier derived from the experimental rate constant for a closely related aldehyde inhibitor, GC373, at 30\u00b0is 21.1 kcal\u00b7 mol \u22121 , 18,51 a value close to our B3LYP estimation for PF-00835231. The agreement also obtained between the theoretical and experimental values of the activation free energy for the reaction of the natural substrate 8 and the N3 inhibitor 15 with 3CL protease provides further support to the validity of the B3LYP functional in the study of these processes.",

The geometrical descriptions obtained from these two methods agree well with the DFT/MM results previously obtained. The main difference with respect to the DFT/MM results, which does not affect the description of the chemical steps, is the formation of a hydrogen bond between the hydroxyl group and the carbonyl oxygen atom of the substrate at the reactant state of the process at the GFN2-xTB level (note the smaller value of CV3 in Figure 4c for the reactant state when using GFN2-xTB). The evolution of the bond-breaking and bondforming distances follows the same timing than that observed when B3LYP and M06-2X functionals are employed. The reaction is triggered by the abstraction of the proton of Cys165 by His41, followed by the formation of the S\u03b3\u2212C bond and the protonation of the substrate mediated by the hydroxyl group. GFN2-xTB shows a shorter S\u03b3\u2212C distance when the proton is being transferred to His41, about 2.4 \u00c5, while DFT and DFTB3 calculations predict a S\u03b3\u2212C distance of about 2.7 \u00c5. GFN2-xTB also predicts a slightly more concerted character for the proton transfers between His41, the hydroxyl group, and the carbonyl oxygen atom of the substrate, as observed in the evolution of the respective CVs (CV3, CV4, CV5, and CV6) in Figure 4c . The shape of the free energy profiles obtained at GFN2-xTB and DFTB3 levels (see Figure 4a ) also agrees qualitatively with the DFT results, showing a TS corresponding to the proton transfer from His41 to the substrate, although the barriers are substantially smaller (8.8 and 9.6 kcal\u00b7mol \u22121 , using GFN2-xTB and DFTB3, respectively, see Table 1 ). Both tight-binding methods also agree with B3LYP results in describing the IP as a metastable species presenting a flat free energy landscape around (see pink and green lines in Figure 4a ).",

However, the MFEPs located using these QM descriptions present noticeable differences with respect to the DFT/MM results. At the PM6 level, the S\u03b3\u2212C distance at the reactant state is substantially shorter than that with other methods, about 2.5 \u00c5; while using other QM levels, the distance is closer or longer than 3.0 \u00c5 (see red lines in Figure 4c ). Using PM6, Journal of Chemical Theory and Computation pubs.acs.org/JCTC Article when the proton of the Cys145 side chain is being abstracted by His41, S\u03b3\u2212C is almost completely formed; while in other cases, the bond is formed only after the deprotonation of the S\u03b3 atom. Regarding the proton transfer from His41 to the substrate, the PM6 method predicts a reversed ordering for the proton relay mechanism: the proton transfer from His41 to the hydroxyl group precedes the proton transfer from this group to the carbonyl oxygen atom of the substrate (see the evolution of CV3, CV4, CV5, and CV6 in Figure 4c ). Instead, the AM1d Hamiltonian predicts the same ordering than the DFT/MM results. However, this last method fails to describe the formation of the S\u03b3\u2212C bond. First, the proton transfer from Cys145 to His41 is decoupled from the nucleophilic attack; the S\u03b3\u2212C distance starts to decrease only once the sulfur atom has been deprotonated (see red line in Figure 4c ). Second, the S\u03b3\u2212 C bond is only fully formed once the carbonyl oxygen atom has been protonated, reflecting the inaccurate description of the carbanionic species with this semiempirical Hamiltonian. The energetic description is not much better. With both semiempirical Hamiltonians, the IP form is predicted to be a minimum even more stable than the reactants, with relative free energies of \u22121.3 and \u22120.7 kcal\u00b7mol \u22121 (see Table 1 ) with respect to the reactants, at the PM6 and AM1d levels, respectively. Instead, the AM1d Hamiltonian predicts a much more reasonable activation free energy. The free energy differences of the rate-limiting TSs with respect to the reactants are 2.2 and 19.7 kcal\u00b7mol \u22121 . In all cases, the reaction is clearly exergonic.",

In our case, we corrected the DFTB3/MM and GFN2-xTB/MM values (our LL methods) by means of single-point energy calculations at the B3LYPD3/MM level (the HL method). The structures selected to calculate the correction were obtained after LL optimizations at different s values corresponding to the final positions of the string nodes. The optimizations along the Path-CV were done iteratively following forward and backward directions until the convergence of consecutive energy profiles. For each node of the string, we carried optimizations combining the steepest descent and the conjugated gradient optimization algorithms, as implemented in Amber. In these optimizations, harmonic restraints are applied along the Path- Journal of Chemical Theory and Computation pubs.acs.org/JCTC Article CV and orthogonally, relaxing both the QM and MM regions. We refer to these correction schemes as HL//LL/MM. The resulting free energy profiles are presented in Figure 6 . The corrected B3LYPD3//DFTB3/MM free energy profile correctly reproduces the free energy height of the rate-limiting TS at the B3LYPD3/MM level, predicting an activation free energy of 18.7 kcal\u00b7mol \u22121 , to be compared with the reference value of 19.7 kcal\u00b7mol \u22121 . The main difference with respect to the B3LYPD3/MM free energy profile is the overestimation of the free energy associated with the IP, probably due to an underestimation of the magnitude of the QM\u2212MM interactions stabilizing the charge separation at the lower level. Instead, the corrected GFN2-xTB/MM free energy profile reproduces better the relative free energy of the IP when compared to the B3LYPD3/MM profile and also the activation free energy (19.1 vs 19.7 kcal\u00b7mol \u22121 ). Regarding the geometry of the TS, the MFEP values reported in Table 2 show that this simple correction scheme does not necessarily result in a TS geometry closer to the target (the one obtained using the B3LYP functional), although the initial geometries provided by the DFTB3 and GFN2-xTB methods were already quite close and then are difficult to improve. The formation of the S\u2212C bond is almost equally well described in all the methods presented in Table 2 . Regarding the hydroxylmediated proton transfer from His41 to the substrate, the correction scheme provides an improved value over the DFTB3 description, while it is slightly too advanced when corrections are applied to the GFN2-xTB MFEP.",

Although the activation free energy would be clearly underestimated, more accurate results can be readily obtained adding single-point energy corrections at higher QM levels, not necessarily restricted to DFT calculations. Note that due to the accuracy of the DFTB3 and GFN2-xTB methods to describe the geometry of the structures appearing along the MFEP, this correction could be limited to the reactant and TS if we were only interested in the activation free energy.

We employed the string method to locate the MFEP using different descriptions for the QM subsystem: two DFT functionals with D3 corrections (B3LYP and M06-2X), two tight-binding methods (DFTB3 and GFN2-xTB), and two semiempirical Hamiltonians (AM1d and PM6). The analysis of the evolution of the CVs used to obtain the MFEP (the distances of all those bonds being broken, formed, or whose bond order changes during the reaction) demonstrates that the two DFT functionals provide a very similar geometrical description of the reaction, although some differences are found regarding the stability of the ion pair, the activation, and the reaction free energies. The use of the two tight-binding methods to describe the QM region results in a geometrical description of the reaction in very good agreement with the DFT results, in particular for the DFTB3 method. Instead, these methods produce activation free energies clearly underestimated with respect to the DFT values. Finally, the MFEPs obtained using the two semiempirical Hamiltonians present larger discrepancies with respect to the DFT results.

Another possibility would be the use of reweighting schemes to introduce correction to the QM description using short, and then easily affordable, simulations at the reactants and TSs or to add energy corrections predicted by machine learning schemes.
