The objective of this study was to determine if the use of a novel periintubation checklist would decrease practitioners' rates of omission of tasks during simulated airway management scenarios. Methods Fifty-four emergency medicine (EM) practitioners from two academic centers were randomized to either their usual approach or use of our checklist, then completed three simulated airway management scenarios. A minimum of two assessors documented the number of tasks omitted and the time until definitive airway management. Discrepancies between assessors were resolved by single assessor video review. Participants also completed a post-simulation survey. Results The average percentage of omitted tasks over three scenarios was 45.7% in the control group (n = 25) and 13.5% in the checklist group (n = 29)-an absolute difference of 32.2% (95% CI 27.8, 36.6%). Time to definitive airway management was longer in the checklist group in the first two of three scenarios (difference of 110.0 s, 95% CI 55.0 to 167.0; 83.0 s, 95% CI 35.0 to 128.0; and 36.0 s, 95% CI \u221218.0 to 98.0 respectively). Conclusions In this dual-center, randomized controlled trial, use of an airway checklist in a simulated setting significantly decreased the number of important airway tasks omitted by EM practitioners, but increased time to definitive airway management.",

            "text": "Over the last decade, there has been substantial interest in the use of patient safety checklists to mitigate risk of adverse events in healthcare settings [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] . Checklists became popular following Berenholtz's study demonstrating a decrease in catheter-associated infections with the use of a checklist for central line insertion in the intensive care unit (ICU) [15] . Subsequently, the World Health Organization's Surgical Safety Checklist study reported a 36% average reduction in postoperative complications and reduced mortality across all participating sites [9] . Marked interest and widespread application of procedural checklists, including airway management checklists, has followed. Many adult patients requiring acute airway management in the emergency department (ED) undergo rapid sequence intubation, which is considered a high-risk event [16] -particularly when performed emergently for unstable patients. In the ICU, it has been reported that 28% of intubations are associated with serious complications, including hypoxemia, hemodynamic collapse, and cardiac arrest [17] . Given the risks associated with intubation, patient safety checklists have been considered for airway management. However, the majority of research in this field consists of observational studies in operating theatres [8, 18] , or before-after studies that focus on specific patient populations such as the ICU [7] , pediatric ED [19] , or trauma patients [13] . Despite heightened interest in pre-intubation checklists, few randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have been performed [10, 20] , and none focused on adult ED intubations.",

The results of this study are consistent with previous studies in operating rooms, ICUs and pediatric EDs that have shown a decrease in omissions of intubation equipment with the use of an intubation checklist [8, 18, 20] . These consistent results are promising since several studies have demonstrated improved patient outcomes with use of protocols that include pre-procedure and intubation checklists [7, 19] . In particular, Smith et al., demonstrated a reduction in complications from 9.2 to 1.5% with use of a pre-procedural checklist [13] , and Fogg et al. demonstrated an increase in first pass intubations (83-93%), and a drop in complications (29-19%) and desaturation events (16-11%) with implementation of a safe operating procedure including an intubation checklist [26] .",

A single-center before-after review of trauma patients intubated in the ED with the aid of a preintubation checklist resulted in no difference in total intubation attempts, hemodynamic stability, ventilator days, length of stay, or mortality [5] . Similarly, an RCT by Janz et al., showed no significant difference in lowest median systolic blood pressure or oxygen saturation with the use of a preintubation checklist in the ICU versus usual care [10] . These studies had small sample sizes and their total adverse event rates were low. Consequently, they may have failed to capture the benefit of a checklist in more complex cases or with less experienced operators.",

It must be considered that the difference in omissions between groups may have been augmented by the fact that less experienced practitioners may benefit more from a comprehensive checklist. Although it is unclear if this decrease in omissions would improve patient safety, this correlation does suggest that there may be a role for the checklist as a training tool for airway management.",

This may have affected the results since data were analyzed using the intention-totreat principle. Furthermore, despite the introductory video demonstrating a \"do-confirm\" technique for checklist use, several participants used the checklist as a \"read-do\" tool [21] . Failure to use the checklist in a \"do-confirm\" manner may have increased time to definitive airway management. Most importantly, the inconsistent manner in which participants utilized the checklist, highlights the importance of training to ensure proper checklist use prior to clinical implementation. Simulation could play an important role in such training activities.",

Interestingly, even in the scenario with the greatest difference in time between groups, use of the checklist only increased time to definitive airway management by 110 s-the clinical significance of which is unclear. Furthermore, this increase in time to intubation was only present in the first two scenarios. In the third case, there was no difference in time to definitive airway management between groups. Possible explanations for this include: (1) as participants became more familiar with the checklist their efficiency improved (noting that the time difference between groups decreased by 30-50 s between scenarios); (2) the checklist appropriately prepared practitioners for a failed airway; or (3) practitioners rushed though the checklist given the urgency of impending airway in the third scenario. Ultimately, this small, transient effect of checklist use on time to definitive airway management should not detract from trialing a checklist in a clinical setting.",

It is acknowledged that results may have been different had the study reached the original sample size. Second, the inability to use a previously validated checklist and assessment tool limits the generalizability of these results. Third, use of theatre-based simulation both prevented the assessment of patient-centered outcomes, and likely impacted performance due to reduced realism. Some tasks, which are almost instinctive in a clinical setting (e.g. securing the endotracheal tube post intubation), were frequently missed, particularly in the control group. This may have overestimated the benefits of checklists. Additionally, a lack of comfort with simulation and verbalization of actions may have caused some participants to seemingly 'omit tasks' such as ensuring monitors were functioning or identifying reasons for difficult intubation. These tasks may have been performed mentally by the participant but would only be assessed as 'complete' if verbalized or physically observed.",
