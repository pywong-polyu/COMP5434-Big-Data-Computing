            "text": "The novel coronavirus disease 2019 has placed tremendous pressure on public health systems across the world. Compared with the healthy population, cancer patients are more prone to developing psychological problems, including depression and anxiety, because of worries about cancer recurrence, cancer symptoms, treatment-related discomfort, a lack of social interaction and the impact on their financial well-being. This paper aimed to identify existing evidence on psychological symptoms and their associated factors among cancer patients in the Chinese Mainland during the COVID-19 pandemic, and on interventions to effectively manage these symptoms. Articles related to the prevalence, the risk factors and interventions of psychological symptoms among cancer patients in the Chinese Mainland during COVID-19 published between December 2019 and August 2020 were searched in two English (PubMed and Embase) and two Chinese (CNKI and Wan Fang Data) databases. A total of 180 studies were identified, and 18 studies were included in the review after removing duplicates and screening for relevancy. The results suggest that patients with cancer in the Chinese Mainland have suffered psychological pressure during COVID-19, with a high prevalence of psychological distress, depression and anxiety reported across most of the reviewed studies. Pandemic-related factors such as treatment discontinuation and worry about being infected are associated with these symptoms. Nurses may help to relieve these symptoms by identifying stressors, providing relevant information through mass and social media and referring patients to specialists for psychological support. However, evidence about treatments and interventions for these symptoms is limited, and additional research is warranted to identify effective interventions to promote resilience in this patient population.",

Cancer patients are more prone to developing psychological problems than the healthy population [3] [4] [5] and are at increased risk of depression and anxiety because of worries about cancer recurrence, cancer symptoms, treatment-related discomfort, a lack of social interaction and the impact on their financial well-being. As China has been greatly affected by COVID-19 since its outbreak in December 2019, Chinese cancer patients are experiencing increased psychological symptoms, and there is a need to improve psychological care for Chinese cancer patients at this time [6] . Therefore, this paper aims to identify existing evidence on psychological symptoms and their associated factors among cancer patients in the Chinese Mainland during the COVID-19 pandemic, and on interventions to effectively manage these symptoms.",

The study revealed that having been to Wuhan (the original epicentre of the pandemic), the discontinuation of cancer treatment, perceived poor health and a diagnosis of cancer metastasis were possible reasons for the elevated distress. A third study assessed psychological distress in terms of fear of disease progression [7] .

The other evaluated the effectiveness of a 'nurse-led intervention' for stress reduction [12] , in which nurses used telephone calls and home visits to identify stressors in patients' narratives and invited two experts in psychological counselling to guide the intervention.

For patients with the same type of cancer, the prevalence of depression and anxiety reported by different studies [8, 10] also varies. It may be explained by the instrument used (e.g. the Generalised Anxiety Disorder Questionnaire or the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale) to assess psychological symptoms. Besides, one study [13] found that the intensity level of psychological symptoms among the participants receiving radiation treatment was relatively low, which may be explained by the heterogeneity of the sample. Of note, the study site and time period may have affected the results. Patients in studies conducted in Wuhan [7, 9] or during the early stage of the pandemic [22] might have experienced greater uncertainty related to the pandemic, which may have been associated with depression and anxiety.",
