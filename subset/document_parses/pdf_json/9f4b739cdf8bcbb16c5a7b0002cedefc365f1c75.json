There is great variation in the amount and decomposability of litter produced by plant species (Aber et al . 1990; Berendse et al . 1989; Van Vuuren et al . 1992 ). Such differences are likely to have important consequences for soil organic matter dynamics and nutrient mineralization when plant species composition changes during succession. Various studies have indeed demonstrated the influence of the dead plant material on N mineralization (Olson 1958; Berendse 1990) , including species level effects (Wedin & Tilman 1990; Van Vuuren et al . 1992; Stelzer & Bowman 1998) . However, most of these studies have only compared clearly divergent species (Berendse 1990; Van Vuuren et al . 1992; Stelzer & Bowman 1998) . Wedin & Tilman (1990) found that N mineralization was higher when plots contained early rather than late successional grasses. Van Vuuren et al . (1992 , 1993 , however, found that litter from early successional species with low potential growth rates decomposed less easily than that from late successional, faster growing species. They contended that increased decomposability, combined with an increased biomass turnover, resulted in the accelerated increase in N mineralization observed during other studies on succession (cf. Berendse 1998) . Interpretation of observational studies may therefore be confounded by the choice of the species.",

Not only does plant species composition affect the release of nutrients, but soil fertility also has a major impact on the plant community composition. We therefore carried out a long-term garden experiment with 14 species (six grass species and eight dicotyledonous species) with a range of potential growth rates and adaptations to habitats with different nutrient supplies. The species, which were assigned to high, intermediate or low soil fertility groups on the basis of the nutrient level of their preferred habitat, respectively, were planted in monocultures in garden plots to ensure that the soil conditions were initially identical. The nitrogen mineralization and nitrification was measured in soil samples taken from and incubated in these plots in order to analyse the long-term effects of each species. We focused on the effects of the test species on: (i) annual net N mineralization; (ii) the seasonal pattern of N mineralization; and (iii) the fraction of the total N mineralization that is nitrified.

After removal, tubes were closed with low-density polyethene caps and one of each pair of samples (initial sample) was transported to the laboratory in a cooled box and stored overnight at 5 \u00b0 C. The mineral N was extracted the day after collection. The other tube (incubated sample) was returned to its original position in the soil: four holes of 4 mm diameter in the part that remained above the soil surface allowed the passage of air but the lids prevented water entering the tube. At the end of the incubation period the incubated samples were removed (as above) and the amount of mineral N accumulated was determined by the method of Berendse (1990) . Before the analysis the loose litter was removed from the soil core and discarded. After removing the roots each sample was homogenized and 20 g of field-moist soil was extracted with 50 mL of 1 mol KCl l -1 . Thereafter the NH 4 + and the NO 3 content were determined using a Skalar autoanalyser San plus system. The soil moisture content of each sample was determined by drying the remainder of the field-moist soil overnight at 105 \u00b0 C. The volumetric soil moisture content was calculated relative to the volumetric amount of dry soil. The bulk soil density of the 0 -10 cm soil layer at each site was calculated from the average amount of dry soil per initial sample.",

Higher N mineralization rates in the plots with high fertility species were associated with lower mean living biomass in August 1999. From earlier studies we know that both biomass production and its turnover rate is much greater for high fertility species (Grime 1994; Berendse et al . 1998) . We therefore attribute the lower amount of living biomass of the high and moderate fertility species at the end of the experiment to these higher turnover rates. The dead leaves supply large quantities of litter for decomposition resulting in an increased N mineralization rate. There was a strong seasonality within patterns of soil N mineralization. Such patterns of N mineralization and nitrification can be largely attributed to seasonal variation in temperature and soil moisture content (Swift et al . 1979; Sierra 1997) , with a low rate during winter (November until March) reflecting low temperature and high soil moisture content. The rise in temperature during spring (March until May) should increase microbial activity and enable more inorganic N to be released (Sierra 1997) , although this pattern was only observed in plots with dicot species of groups 1 and 2 and grasses of group 1. The N mineralization and nitrification rates of the dicots of groups 1 and 2 were also higher than group 3 in autumn (September until November), with the species of group 1, characteristic of fertile soils, having high values for both production and turnover of biomass . Late summer senescence of leaves of these species supplies large quantities of litter for decomposition in autumn, whereas most grasses remain green until the winter. It therefore seems likely that the timing of senescence of the plant biomass and the amount of litter produced were responsible for the higher net mineralization of the high and moderate fertility dicots during autumn and spring and for high fertility grass species during spring.",

We found evidence that species replacement during succession might also have major effects on the N cycle. The species from fertile habitats caused an increase in N mineralization, whereas species from much less fertile habitats had a relatively negative effect on the N release from the soil. The differences in N mineralization and nitrification in our experiment were not simply a function of the net plant biomass production but are probably also due to differences in biomass turnover rate (Berendse et al . 1987; Aerts et al . 1992; Schl\u00e4pfer & Ryser 1996) and litter decomposability (Berendse et al . 1989; Van Vuuren et al . 1993; Cornelissen 1996) . We postulate that high fertility species can accelerate and low fertility species can slow down the N cycle and that such species-specific feed-backs could affect the rate of change in species composition during succession. More knowledge about the below-ground carbon and nutrient flows from plant to the soil is needed to obtain a deeper insight into the effects of different plant species on nutrient mineralization.",
