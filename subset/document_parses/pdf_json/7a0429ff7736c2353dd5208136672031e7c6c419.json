The case has been debated extensively [2] [3] [4] and involves ABC (who is a daughter of a man with Huntington's disease, HD). The man killed his wife and whilst in the care of psychiatric prison services received his diagnosis of HD. He expressly forbade his doctors from telling ABC about this inherited condition because she was pregnant at the time and he was worried she would have a termination of pregnancy if she knew. ABC sued the NHS trust caring for her father, claiming that her father's clinical team had a duty of care to share his diagnosis with her even 1 though he explicitly did not consent to this. ABC said that, had she known, she would have indeed had a termination of her pregnancy. The judge, Mrs Justice Yip in this case was unconvinced by her argument, and for this reason plus others, ABC did not win her case. However, despite this, the judge's evaluation of ABC's situation has clear implications for current clinical practice, specifically within Clinical Genetics and Genetic Counselling Services. As here, genetic healthcare professionals often have a close clinical proximity to multiple members of the same family.",

Close proximity is unclear in this situation as whilst the genetic healthcare professional has never met these relatives, they have been given enough information to be able to contact them (there is no need to 'track them down' and it would be easy enough to make contact). Given that within the professional code of practice, genetic counsellors care for both 'patients and their families' [7] , it would be expected that as part of their duty to such relatives, they would at least make an attempt to try to contact them. In reality professional practice varies in relation to this. It would be usual for genetic healthcare professionals to encourage the proband to pass on information to their relatives. But if they refused to do this, and if the genetic healthcare professional deemed on the basis of the balancing exercise that the relative should be told, then (as per the JCGM professional recommendations) they should contact them (as long as it is reasonable and practical to do) without the need to establish a different sort of proximity. \u2022 A regional clinical genetics service may see multiple members of the same family. In this case they may be 'known' to several different clinicians within the team. Close proximity is established between the service and the family but not necessarily between individual clinicians and specific relatives. Here, it would be helpful to clarify if 'proximity' can only be established, one-to-one, between one clinician and one patient, or whether 'proximity' could apply to service delivery. Further, what happens if that service delivery is across many geographical areas? Here, Mrs Justice Yip states that there cannot be a duty of care to a patient that the clinician has never met; however, there are situations in which this seems difficult to maintain. For example a doctor would act on a duty of care to the passengers of an airline if he knew that the pilot had a risk of crashing the plane (and indeed in this case the doctor has no direct proximity to any of the passengers).",

What is different is that there is now a legal credibility given to the professional guidance. As long as clinicians can show that they have weighed up the pros and cons of breaching confidentiality versus forewarning atrisk relatives of possible disease, and a duty to warn has been established, then legally this should be acted upon. This is a shift from the prior misunderstanding that a duty to protect confidentiality automatically trumps everything. In exceptional circumstances, there is now legal support to prioritise a different duty. In the context of genomic medicine, this has important consequences for clinical practice.",
