We present a model where public transportation data is used as an indicator of broader mobility patterns within a city, including the use of private transportation, walking etc. The mobility parameter derived from this data is used to model the infection rate. As a test case, we study the impact of the usage of the New York City subway on the spread of COVID-19 within the city during 2020. We show that utilizing subway transport data as an indicator of the general mobility trends within the city, and therefore as an indicator of the effective infection rate, improves the quality of forecasting COVID-19 spread in New York City. Our model predicts the two peaks in the spread of COVID-19 cases in NYC in 2020, unlike a standard SIR model that misses the second peak entirely.",

Accordingly, restrictions on human mobility, either directly by shutting down public transportation 6, 7 or indirectly by restricting public and private gatherings 8 , which were highly effective in stopping the spread of COVID-19.

There are various models of disease spread that incorporate human mobility patterns, such as a recent disease transmission model inspired by collision theory gas-phase chemistry 14 , or a metapopulation model that allows for the movement of individuals between subpopulations 15 . We propose a model based on SIR dynamics where we explicitly model human mobility as a parameter and treat the infection rate as a function of the mobility of a region. To effectively model the spread of COVID-19 in NYC, we focus on data from the NYC subway.

            "text": "As restrictions were slowly eased in the later half of the year, there was a corresponding increase in the usage of public transport, although some modes were preferred over others at different rates than before the pandemic. Bikehares, for example, had recovered to their 2019 levels by September 30, 2020 while subway ridership was at 30% of pre-pandemic levels 18 . Despite the different rates at which different modes recovered, both bikeshares and the subway saw increases in usage in the latter half of 2020. We believe that this increase in both modes of transport corresponds to the underlying increase in human mobility as restrictions were loosened after June 8, 2020 . This motivates us to use this directly measurable traffic as a proxy for all traffic in the city. We collected and analyzed the subway turnstile data of New York City for 12 consecutive months, starting from January 2020 to December 2020. The MTA publishes turnstile data on a weekly basis, which includes administrative information such as the control area, unit number, station name and line name, as well as the counts of the entries and exits at a specific time for a particular turnstile 16 . The system collects these counts every four hours, each of which is a cumulative register value. The data were first converted into dataframes and then into a combination of control area code, remote unit, subunit channel position (SCP), as well as the time of the observation that serves as a unique ID to identify and remove duplicate records. We removed entries related to Port Authority Trans-Hudson (PATH) trains, since they do not represent the mobility among NYC boroughs. The absolute difference between the first and last counts at a turnstile on a particular day defines the number of subway riders passing through that particular turnstile. The geographic coordinates of the station and the borders of each borough allow us to place each station in its corresponding borough. We calculated the total number of borough-level subway riders by summing the numbers of riders at all the turnstiles of all subway stations located within each borough. To estimate the mobility between boroughs, we used a survey that was conducted among subway riders regarding the origin and destination of their trips 21 . Given the number of departures at a given station, we used probabilities extracted from the survey to determine the destinations of those trips. COVID-19 data. We used publicly available data published by the NYC government about the number of new COVID-19 cases reported for each day and for each of the five boroughs 22 . Figure 1a shows that this data has a clear weekly cyclical pattern. Figure 1b shows that this pattern arises because of the much smaller numbers of cases that were reported on weekends than on weekdays. We remove this pattern by using a running 7-day average of the number of daily cases.",

While more powerful models for modelling disease spread exist, such as the SEIR model 26 , we picked the SIR model in order to reduce the number of parameters and avoid overfitting. The COVID-19 hospitalization data that we use only reports daily newly infected cases and we do not believe this data is fine-grained enough to justify the use of a more complex model. The SIR model divides the total population (N) into susceptible (S), infected (I), and recovered or dead (R) compartments. The equations governing the spread of the disease are where \u03b2 and \u03b3 are the infection and recovery rate, respectively. We modify the model by dividing the total population into subpopulations called regions, each with a fraction of the population p j living in region j, thus j p j = 1 . When we apply the model to New York City the different p j represent the populations of the five boroughs of New York City, normalized by the total population of the city, which was 8,804,190 in 2020 23 . Within a region, people will have different infection rates based on their activity. The infection rate for individuals working from home and following strict quarantine protocols will be lower than the rate for frontline workers. Each activity-based cohort has an associated infection rate \u03b2 jc . Additionally, people may also have access to different quality of healthcare, which may impact the frequency of testing and the likelihood of visiting a doctor. Both of these parameters influence the recovery rate of a patient. Each healthcare-based cohort has an associated recovery rate \u03b3 je . The fraction of the total population in region j with behavior c and healthcare e is denoted as p jce . For parameters representing the population fractions, an omitted index indicates a sum over all values of this index, so p jc = e p jce and p j = c,e p jce etc.",

For a variety of reasons, such as travel into and out of the city and the usage of multiple modes of transport, the number of arrivals and departures at a station will not match exactly. In order to account for this, we match the number of arrivals and departures at a given snapshot in time in the data, and any discrepancy is added to the next time bin. Once all time periods have been accounted for, any unmatched arrivals or departures are ignored. The equation then becomes where where U A t (\u03c4 k ) and U D t (\u03c4 k ) are the unmatched arrivals and departures from the previous time period.

Next, we use the end of the training period, i new data (t train ) (where t train , is the last day of the training data) as the initial condition for the testing period. However, we cannot directly use the number of daily new cases as the initial condition. Instead, the model requires knowledge of the active infected and total recovered cases, i(t train ) and r(t train ) , at the end of the training period as the initial conditions for the testing period. This was not a concern when we were fitting our model for the training period since we assumed that i(0) = 1/N and r(0) = 0 . In order to predict the spread of the disease in the testing period, however, we need to know these quantities to serve as the initial conditions for our model. While data are available for the number of active and recovered cases for New York state, they are not available for New York City. We estimate the total recovered population by dividing the cumulative deaths reported in New York City by the state-wide case mortality rate 29 where r est (t) is the estimated total recovered population (which includes both individuals who have died as well as those who have recovered from the disease) expressed as a fraction of the total population of New York City. We also need to know i est (t) , the estimated total active number of infected cases. Specifically, we only need to estimate i est (t train ) , the total number of active cases on the last day of the training data. We do this by searching for a value of i est (t train \u2212 1) such that using i est (t train \u2212 1) and r est (t train \u2212 1) as the initial condition for our model and predicting the daily number of cases for the next day gives us where i new (t train ) are the daily number of new cases output by our model on the last day of the training data. The corresponding values of i est (t train ) and r est (t train ) become the initial conditions for the model at the start of the testing period. The model's prediction is shown in Fig. 4a . Table 2 shows the parameters that minimize the MSE with and without a testing period. Figure 1a shows that the total number of cases in NYC rapidly increased after the discovery of the first recorded case, followed by a decline and then a second rise.

While we minimize the MSE during the fitting process, the table also reports the in-sample and out of sample R 2 score of the best fit. We use t = 10 \u22122 for all our simulations. www.nature.com/scientificreports/ taxis dropped at the same time as that of the subway 19, 20 , and bikeshare usage increased in the same period as subway usage, although at a much faster rate 18 . Additional data on other forms of mobility, specially in the latter half of 2020, would allow us to construct the mobility parameter that encapsulates multiple modes of transport. We also assume that the residents of a borough that leave it using the subway return to the home borough using the subway on the same day. This assumption impacts our inter-region mixing parameter through the calculation \ufffd\u03c4 j , the average time spent away from the home borough.",

While we have adjusted for the drop in reporting on the weekends by taking a 7-day moving average, the fraction of cases that were reported may have changed over the course of the year due to other factors as well. A possible effect of this variation in the reporting rate is the very high ratio of the average infection rate, defined as \u03b2 avg (t) = j p j \u03b2 j (t) , to the recovery rate, \u03b3 , that our model predicts during the beginning of the infection, shown in Fig. 4b . The precipitous rise in cases at the start of the pandemic may represent a slew of people getting tested in a short amount of time as awareness of the epidemic spread and widespread testing became available, rather than accurately representing the true spread of the disease. After this initial period our \u03b2 avg (t)/\u03b3 ratio has a minimum of 1.43 and a maximum of 5.25. While an initial estimate for the reproduction number was reported to be 2.2 in Wuhan 30 , other studies using SIR models have reported a much higher reproduction number ranging from a global estimate of 4.5 31 to some regions having a value as high as 7.8 32 . While the ratio \u03b2 avg (t)/\u03b3 is not equivalent to the reproduction number (due to the connectivity of the different compartments in our model) and should be seen only as a crude estimate, it is encouraging that the ratio predicted by our model falls within the range of estimates reported in the literature.",

Based only on fitting the data, our model confirms that subway usage is correlated with the usage of other forms of public transportation because using it as a proxy for the short-range mobility parameter allows us to predict the two peaks in the NYC infection rate in 2020. Using this model and the turnstile data from the NYC subway, we predict the trend of daily infections in NYC for a three-week period. Our model accounts for inter-region mixing of populations, and uses an infection rate that is dependent on the short-range mobility within a region.",
