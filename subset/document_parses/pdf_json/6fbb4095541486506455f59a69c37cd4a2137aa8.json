It is now widely accepted that diabetes mellitus is a major risk factor for CAD. Impaired fasting glucose (also known as impaired fasting glycemia, IFG) is a type of prediabetes. In individuals with IFG, fasting blood sugar levels are consistently above the normal range but below the threshold for a diagnosis of diabetes mellitus. IFG has been associated with micro vascular disease (Hanna-Moussa et al., 2009) , heart failure and cardiovascular mortality (Henry et al., 2002; Sorkin et al., 2005; Xu et al., 2015; Huang et al., 2016; Cai et al., 2020; Cai et al., 2021; Mai et al., 2021) Several meta-analyses concluded that IFG was associated with an increased risk of CAD. However, it is still unclear as to whether or not there is a relationship between IFG and severity of CAD (Yan et al., 2009; Konstantinou et al., 2010) , and further investigations are required.",

Blood samples for TC, LDLc, HDLc, triglycerides and fasting blood glucose (FBG) measurements were collected after overnight fasting. TC, LDLc, HDLc, triglycerides and FBG measurements were conducted by the clinical chemistry department of the First Affiliated Hospital of Shantou University Medical College. Coronary angiography was carried out by experienced interventional cardiologists. CAD was defined as \u226550% diameter stenosis in any of the major epicardial coronary artery, as measured by quantitative coronary angiography (Douglas et al., 2011; Dehmer et al., 2012; Fihn et al., 20142014) . Disease severity was determined by number of diseased vessels (Golbahar et al., 2005) . In this study, myocardial infarction included acute myocardial infarction and history of myocardial infarction. A diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction was established when there is acute myocardial injury with clinical evidence of acute myocardial ischemia and with detection of a rise and/or fall of cTn values with at least one value above the 99th percentile URL and at least one of the following: symptoms of myocardial ischemia; new ischemic ECG changes; development of pathological Q waves; imaging evidence of new loss of viable myocardium or new regional wall motion abnormality in a pattern consistent with an ischemic etiology; identification of a coronary thrombus by angiography. (Thygesen et al., 2018) IFG was defined by a fasting glucose level of 5.61-6.99 mmol/L and non-IFG by \u2264 5.60 mmol/L.",

All of these factors may contribute to progression of the triple-vessel disease in IFG patients. Several limitations should be considered. Firstly, the crosssectional nature of the study prevents us from confirming the causal effects angiographically confirmed CAD cases in the pathogenesis of IFG. Secondly, triple-vessel disease often indicates a poor prognosis for patients. However, in this study, we did not observe the prognosis of the patients which limited its persuasion. Third, not only IFG but also impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), plays important role in CAD progression (Huang et al., 2016) .
