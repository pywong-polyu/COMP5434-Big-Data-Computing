The focus was on patients with hepatocellular carcinoma or intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, cared for around the world during the first COVID-19 pandemic wave. While recent studies have described the mortality in cancer patients diagnosed with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection as reaching 28.9% to 33.6%, a relatively modest 4.4% to 5.5% has been reported patients cohorts including hepatobiliary cancers [1, 2] . In the case of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and some intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (iCCA), almost all patients also have underlying cirrhosis, Marjot et al. reported that baseline liver disease stage and alcohol-related liver disease were independent risk factors for death from SARS-CoV-2 infection, increasing the risk of hepatic decompensation [3, 4] . Even in the absence of these significant complications in liver cancer ",

In 46.2% of centres virtual visits by video or phone calls were done, and 29.9% of centres were forced to postpone visits (not transformed into virtual). Table 3 Notably, the approach maintained in almost all centres (93.2%) was systemic treatment LC patients. This may have been associated with the stage of the disease, stage being one of the priority criteria identified at the time of maintaining the planned schedule. The fact that the most widely used systemic therapies were oral tyrosine kinase inhibitors, which can be selfadministered by the patient at home rather than requiring a visit to the hospital, is also likely to have played a role.",

Hanna et al. described a significant association between cancer treatment delay and increased mortality for 13 out of 17 indications analyzed, although LC was not one of those analyzed [12] .

Obviously, tumour stage at diagnosis will be one of the most relevant, as tumour growth is assumed to be faster along its evolution [14] [15] [16] . We should also keep in mind that the detection of changes in outcome or tumour progression during the delayed interventions may translate into a marginal impairment without clinically relevant consequences. It must also be noted in advance that any suggestion we raise in the future will not have the background that would be provided by a randomized controlled trial comparing conventional timing vs. delayed intervention. Despite this limitation, our future data will be instrumental in the identification of those areas where the changes induced by the J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f pandemic have been beneficial or detrimental. If the outcome at any step of the health care pathway is clearly worse, we would have an estimation of the deleterious consequences of COVID-19 pandemic beyond the infection itself. This may inform us on the most appropriate measures to be adopted in the future; either while this pandemic persists or repeats, as is happening with the current second wave, or should another public health crisis emerge in the future.",

Indeed, since recruitment into treatments in clinical trials had been impacted (only 9.7% of centres maintained the same recruitment rate they had before the pandemic), almost all the visits within treatments in clinical trials have been devoted to follow-up assessments rather than new patient recruitment. As previous studies had shown [20, 21] , maintaining treatments in clinical trials activities requires a great effort and reorganization of the LC team, to define a protocol to continue with these activities while protecting patients from contracting SARS-CoV-2 infection.",

As an example, Amaddeo et al. have described how LC care changed in the metropolitan area of Paris alongside with the evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic[5]. In addition to those infected by SARS-CoV-2, non-infected patients with LC may have also been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic related modifications in clinical practice and the priorities established for population health care. For future decision making, it is relevant to evaluate the consequences of interrupting or delaying the schedule of LC screening programs or treatments, as established before the COVID-19 pandemic, on LC prognosis.

The project was promoted through the ENS-CCA network, organizers' personal Twitter account and the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) account for a period of 4 weeks before starting the survey. The organizers of the project (MI, AF and MR) elaborated the survey and 5 independent LC experts reviewed/tested it and sent their suggestions (JCN, GZ, LR, BS, JB). The survey had mandatory sections focused on Clinical Practice (related and non-related to COVID-19) and an optional section focused on Clinical Research.

Of note, despite these centres continued offering their full range of LC care, 3/10 of these centres reported that patients were reluctant to come to the hospital due to concerns about the possibility of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Diagnostic strategy and staging procedures during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic Based on the 76 centres, 40.8% modified their diagnostic procedure requests and timing (biopsy and imaging technique) during COVID-19 pandemic. 39.5% modified the Magnetic Resonance/Computed Tomography scan strategy for LC staging or treatment response evaluation. Figure 2 describes the criteria used to adhere the pre-defined schedule of diagnostic and staging procedures. The most frequent criteria were the suspected tumour stage (75% and 63.6% for diagnosis and staging, respectively) and the degree of cancer suspicion (68.8 and 48.5%, respectively). In 28% of centres, at least one asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infected patient was incidentally diagnosed due to radiology test done for the oncology indication. Treatments options during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic Despite the modifications made during the COVID-19 pandemic, 96% of the centres maintained their ability to perform LC treatments. From 50 centres with liver transplantation (LT) program prior to COVID-19 pandemic, 28 (56.0%) (n = 28/50) of the centres did not modify the LT activity, while 60.8% of centres (n = 45/76) were able to perform surgical resections, 68.9% (n = 51/76) percutaneous treatments and 81.1% (n = 60/76) locoregional treatments.

It was modified in 19 of these centres (51.4%): an increase of the number of calls (more days and/or more hours/day) was the most frequent modification in 84% of the centres, whereas 7 centres (17.9%) introduced phone call visits as a new practice during COVID-19 pandemic. Fifty centres included the type of visit (first vs. follow-up visit) and 53 centres the disease status (stable disease vs. progressive disease) in their criteria guiding decisions on whether to convert a face-to-face visit into a phone call visit (68.9% and 71.6%, respectively). The age of the patient and the patient address/distance to the hospital were adopted as criteria for phone call visits in 20 and 24 centres, respectively.

DISCUSSION To ameliorate COVID-19 pandemic impact on LC, several organizations advised multiple recommendations based on expert opinion data at the beginning of the first wave[6-9]. The results of this survey highlight the potential clinical significance of the implemented modifications, predicting a likely major impact of COVID-19 pandemic on outcomes, given the magnitude of the disruption in patient care -from screening to diagnosis, staging and treatment-. According to the present results, all areas of clinical practice were modified during the COVID-19 pandemic first wave. The major changes related to the suspension of screening programs and surgical treatments (mainly liver transplantation), the decrease of face-to-face visits and the growing role of liver oncology-nurses as key members in the transformation of the digital management of LC in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.",

The results of this survey may induce to predict that the profile of patients diagnosed after the first wave could be more advanced that we have usually have in the pre-pandemic era and will help us to identify confounding factors at the time of analysing the next phase the CERO-19 project.
