            "text": "Background: Breastmilk hand expression (BMHE) is recommended to promote lactation, relieve breast engorgement, and collect milk for future infant feedings. Resources to teach this skill are limited and infrequently developed in partnership with the obstetrical population. In collaboration with maternity care experts and individuals with recent breastfeeding experience, we designed a one-page toolkit that describes the process of BMHE and includes step-by-step instructions and images to illustrate the technique. This study aimed to evaluate the readability, clarity of content, layout, and informational value of this BMHE toolkit. Methods: Individuals who intended to breastfeed, were currently breastfeeding, or had recently breastfed were electronically surveyed and completed a two-part survey that consisted of radio, multi-select, Likert scale, and openended questions. Part one captured sociodemographic factors, obstetrical history, and breastfeeding practices. Part two collected feedback on the BMHE toolkit. Participants were recruited electronically through social media and posters were circulated in antenatal and postnatal care settings in Ottawa, Canada between November 2020 and February 2021. Results: Of the 123 participants, 117 (95.1%) had heard of hand expression prior to reviewing the toolkit and 99 (80.5%) had hand expressed before. Among the 48 participants who were no longer exclusively breastfeeding at the time of the survey, 22 (45.8%) had exclusively breastfed their infant for at least six months and 7 (14.6%) had discontinued exclusive breastfeeding within the first month. When asked about the BMHE toolkit, 118 (95.9%) participants said it was informative, 115 (93.5%) said it was easy to understand, and 114 (92.7%) said it was well laidout. When asked about information seeking behaviours, participants indicated a preference for online resources (58.5%) and video resources (22.0%). Conclusions: The BMHE toolkit was well received by participants and the feedback was favourable overall. The survey feedback will be used to create a revised version of the toolkit that has been validated by the obstetrical patient population. Future research should focus on identifying implementation strategies to optimize the use of the toolkit and increase its effectiveness as an educational resource to teach participants correctly BMHE.",

Exclusive breastfeeding involves feeding an infant human breastmilk and only providing medications, vitamins and oral rehydration when necessary [2] . The health benefits of breastfeeding, for both mother and infant, have been studied extensively [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] . However, initiation and maintenance of breastfeeding after delivery can be challenging for many women [11] , and is influenced by cultural, psychological, and physiological factors [12] . Approximately 25% of individuals cease breastfeeding before their infant is one-month old and approximately only 8% of Canadian individuals continue to exclusively breastfeed at six months of age [13, 14] . Gionet et al. (2013) found that perceived breastmilk insufficiency and the belief that the infant is not receiving enough milk were the two most cited reasons for early weaning within the first month after delivery [15] .",

This technique can be used to promote lactation, soften to assist latching, relieve painful breast engorgement, and collect milk for future infant feedings [16, 17] . Hand expression during the antenatal period may also be recommended to improve mothers' breastfeeding confidence before delivery [18, 19] and collect colostrum for use for infant feedings shortly after delivery. Antenatal colostrum collection has been recommended to individuals with diabetes who have low risk pregnancies to support infant feeds in the early hours and days post-delivery, prevent neonatal hypoglycemia and reduce the need for infant formula use [20] . The current literature suggests that individuals who hand express breastmilk antenatally may encounter fewer challenges when initiating breastfeeding and are less likely to discontinue breastfeeding before six months [16, 21] .",

It was developed in consultation with an expert working group composed of a family physician who is also an internationally board-certified lactation consultant, a maternal-fetal-medicine specialist, a general internist, an endocrinologist and four individuals with recent breastfeeding experience. The toolkit is composed of four different sections. Section 1 (What is hand expression?) briefly explains what hand expression is, Section 2 (Why hand express?) provides reasons one may choose to hand express, Section 3 (How do I get started?) details how to prepare oneself to carry out BMHE, and Section 4 (How do I hand express?) includes step-by step instructions and detailed images illustrating the technique. The bottom right-hand corner of the toolkit contains a hyperlink to a seven-minute narrated video demonstrating BMHE to help individuals better understand this technique. The video, developed by Global Health Media, is freely accessible and available in several different languages, including English and French [28, 29] . The BMHE toolkit scored an 81.5/100 using the Flesch Reading Ease Formula, which suggests it is \"Easy\" to read, and suitable reading material for individuals with a sixth grade reading level or higher [30] .",

This is a high prevalence of BMHE when compared to other studies that have reported approximately 60% of surveyed participants had experience with hand expression [32] . Our findings may be explained by the fact that the survey was distributed in Facebook groups and shared on Twitter accounts that are frequented by healthcare practitioners who have likely been exposed to BMHE during their training or through personal experience. Furthermore, the number of participants who had exclusively breastfed their infant until six months of age (45.8%) and who had discontinued breastfeeding within the infant's first month of life (14.6%) were higher and lower, respectively, when compared to what has been previously reported [13, 14] . The higher rates of exclusive breastfeeding and the lower rates of early discontinuation may be explained the fact that our sample was highly educated and overwhelmingly English-speaking. It is likely that these participants were able to seek out timely breastfeeding [33] support and utilize the many breastfeeding resources that are readily available in English to overcome their challenges.",

In Section 1 (What is hand expression?), participants indicated that they were confused as to why they needed approval from a healthcare provider before performing hand expression in the antenatal period. As such, the second part of the second bullet point in Section 1 that encourages BMHE in the antenatal period will be removed from the toolkit. This is an important revision to highlight as the goal of the toolkit is not to provide education about when to perform BHME, but instead to provide education to individuals on how to effectively perform BMHE. When the toolkit is recommended, whether in the antenatal or postnatal period, will be determined on a case-by-case basis between individuals and their healthcare providers. Next, the language in Section 2 (Why hand express?) that certain participants felt was discouraging the use of human milk supplements, will be completely eliminated. Third, the order of the step-by-step instructions in Section 4 (How do I hand express?) will be reorganized to allow readers to read the images from top to bottom, (i.e., step two will be placed directly beneath step one, instead of to the right of step one). The instructions to describe BMHE in Section 4 will also be rephrased to match the technique outlined in the Global Health Media video [28, 29] . Finally, changes will be made to all sections of the toolkit to ensure that consistent terminology is employed (i.e., any mention of 'nipple' will be changed to 'areola'), instructions are clear and concise (i.e., 'sit up and learn forward' will be changed to 'lean forward'), and established hand expression terminology that is in keeping with the video is utilized (i.e., 'squeeze' will be changed to 'compress').",

This finding is important as it suggests that the toolkit on its own may not replace the time requirement that healthcare providers need to spend teaching BMHE in clinical settings but will facilitate this discussion. Accordingly, it may be important to provide healthcare providers with BMHE training, through an online module for example, to ensure that they are correctly teaching their patients this skill. Implementing Baby-Friendly Initiatives (BFI) at local and national hospitals, birthing centres, and community health centres that aim to \"protect, promote and support breastfeeding in Canada\" will also encourage uptake of the BMHE toolkit [12, 34] .",

First, the survey response rate of 41% was somewhat lower than the reported response rate for similar electronic surveys of healthcare providers [35] . This may be attributed to the surge in digital technologies that has manifested as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic [36] . Second, the respondents of the survey were not representative of the population in that the majority of participants were Caucasian, English-speaking and highly educated. Therefore, our results are likely biased as we are missing important feedback from Black, Indigenous and people of colour, non-English speakers, individuals with lower education or reading levels and potentially individuals from vulnerable populations. To overcome this, additional focused feedback will be sought from consenting individuals when the toolkit is distributed in local clinical care settings or utilized in future trials where BMHE is being taught. Despite this limitation, when developing patientfacing materials, it is important to seek feedback from the target audience and modify the information accordingly to ensure it is up-to-date, accessible, and informative [37] . Finally, the survey did not evaluate the toolkit's ability to correctly teach participants how to hand express breastmilk. As such, to improve the quality of this educational tool, it would be important to collect additional feedback and determine whether the steps included in the BMHE toolkit are effective at teaching individuals how to hand express correctly.",

Our findings provide insight into current breastfeeding practices as well as breastfeeding information-seeking patterns of respondents, which include preferred modality-type and location of information. Although the toolkit was developed in partnership with an expert working group, composed of internationally board-certified lactation consultant, a maternal-fetal-medicine specialist, a general internist, and an endocrinologist, as well as individuals with recent breastfeeding experience, a necessary next step will include evaluation by external experts not involved in the study. Breastfeeding resources should be developed in partnership with both lactational experts and patient partners and evaluated among a diverse group of patient users to ensure that the content is informative, the language is accessible, and that the resource as a whole meets the needs of the target population.Abbreviations BMHE: Breastmilk Hand Expression.",
