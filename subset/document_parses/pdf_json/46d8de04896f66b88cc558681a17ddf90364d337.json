This paper proposes an image threshold segmentation method based on an improved sparrow search algorithm and 2-D maximum entropy method. In the proposed algorithm, the nonlinear inertia weight is introduced into the entrants' update formula to improve the local exploration ability of the algorithm, and Levy flight is introduced into the vigilant sparrows' update formula to prevent the algorithm from falling into the local optimal solution in the later stage of iteration. In addition, improved sparrow search algorithm is tested on fifteen benchmark functions. The results represent the merit of the proposed algorithm with respect to other algorithms. Finally, the proposed algorithm is applied to entropy based image segmentation. Experiment results on classical images and medical images show that the proposed method improves the segmentation effect in terms of peak signal-to-noise ratio and feature similarity.",

            "text": "Threshold image segmentation is a widely used segmentation technology that performs image segmentation based on the information contained in the image gray-level histogram. The gray value difference between the target area and the background area in the image is compared, an appropriate threshold is given to judge the gray value of each pixel in the image belongs to the target region or the background region, so as to segment the image. Nowadays, there are many threshold image segmentation methods, while maximum entropy method [17, 47] , inter class variance method(OTSU) [4, 41] , cross entropy method [10, 25, 50] and minimum error method [5, 22] are divided according to the selection criteria of threshold. Image segmentation based on entropy is very popular, and entropy can be divided into Shannon entropy [39] , tsallis entropy [13] , exponential entropy [42, 51] and arimoto entropy [30] , etc. According to the dimension of image histogram, it also can be classified into one-dimensional (1-D) histogram, two-dimensional (2-D) histogram [1, 6, 45] and so on.",

The gray levels of adjacent pixels in the target or background are highly correlated, but the gray levels of pixels at the junction of target and background are very different. Then the image gray histogram can be regarded as a mixture of two single peak histograms corresponding to the target and background respectively. At this time, if the number of the two distributions is close, the standardized mean difference is far enough and the mean square deviation is small enough, the histogram is bimodal, the pixel value that can be used as the bottom of the valley is found as the threshold between the two peaks. Therefore, the farther the wave crest is away, the greater the chance of separating the target from the background. (2) Noise content in the image. Noise will change the gray value of some pixels in the histogram, resulting in imbalance, such as filling the bottom of the histogram and generating new peaks. (3) Relative size of objects and background. When the target is small or large, the peak of the target and the background in the histogram will be quite different, so it is difficult to distinguish the valley bottom, which affects the selection of threshold. (4) The uniformity of illumination and reflection. When the illumination or the image reflection is uneven, the brightness of the target and background will change, and shadow areas may appear around the target. These factors will affect the change of image gray value, thus affecting the distribution of histogram, resulting in poor segmentation effect.",

In this research, an improved sparrow search algorithm (ISSA) is proposed which combines Levy flight and nonlinear inertia weight. Nonlinear inertia weight would enhance the local exploration ability and Levy flight would help the algorithm escaping from the local optimum. Then a new image threshold segmentation method is proposed based on ISSA. The gray value of each pixel in the graph and the mean of gray in its field are considered, the 2-D entropy is used as the evaluation function, and the entropy optimization is carried out by ISSA to obtain the threshold corresponding to the maximum entropy. In order to verify the feasibility and effectiveness of ISSA, it is tested on fifteen benchmark functions. Results are compared with some well-known algorithms such as SSA, PSO, GWO, ABC, WOA, CSO, and FOA. In the last, state-of-the-art approaches including ISSA, gold eagle optimizer (GEO) [38] , rat swarm optimizer (RSO) [8] , transient search optimization (TSO) [46] , CRSSA [35] , MSCA [48] , HHO-PCNN [14] , 2D-OTSU [31] and 1D-Exponential entropy [43] are applied to image segmentation. Peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and feature similarity (FSIM) are used as evaluation indexes for comparison. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

In 2-D methods, not only the gray information of each pixel, but also the gray information of its neighborhood is considered. The threshold t and region threshold s are selected to segment the image into four parts. The target and background (A and B in Fig. 2 ) are mainly concentrated in the two regions near the diagonal, and the other two regions are mainly the image edge and noise interference, we should makes full use of the gray information of the target and background areas, and more efficient and accurate to find the best threshold (t, s).

Although MSCA-based segmentation method has also obtained a good threshold, on the whole, the performance of the ISSA-based segmentation method is more prominent. Tables 8 and 9 show the PSNR and FSIM of the nine methods for twelve images.

Second, Through the threshold obtained by ISSA optimization for classical images segmentation, the maximum entropy is obtained, and higher PSNR and FSIM are achieved. The quality of segmented images is better. Third, the segmentation results for lung CT images show that in medical application, ISSA can still obtain better performance, including higher PSNR and FSIM. The nodules and diseased tissues on lung organs can be clearly segmented. Tables 13 and 14 list algorithms that obtained the highest PSNR and FSIM in experiments, and record number of times to obtain the optimal values when segmented different images. The statistical results show the ISSA performs better in image segmentation of different types of images. Since in most tests, PSNR and FSIM obtained using ISSA method are the best.",

And as a newly proposed swarm intelligence optimization algorithm, the SSA has strong robustness, fast convergence speed, and can be applied to optimization problems in other areas, so it has great research significance.
