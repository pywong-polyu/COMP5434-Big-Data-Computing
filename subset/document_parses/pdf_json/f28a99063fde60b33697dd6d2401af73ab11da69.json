An important question that arises before the the scientists is how to forecast the possible occurrence of the COVID-19 wave, so that it can be found e.g., when the fourth wave is likely to happen in those countries yet to face the fourth wave.

Our approach is to use the data observed due to COVID-19 in the earlier waves in any country and train the model over that. Once the model is trained, the same is used to forecast the occurrence the next wave in other countries. The fundamental assumption in our study is that the behaviour of the SARS virus remains the same all over the world irrespective of countries. In other words, our thought process is that if the virus is causing the fourth wave in any country, why it will not cause the same in other country if the infection started spreading? As we mentioned in the preceding paragraph, there are a few countries, namely, South Africa and Zimbabwe already have started to face the fourth wave, and based on the data of those countries, one can predict the arrival and the end of the fourth wave in countries like India.

The intensity of the impact will depend on the various factors like infectibility, fatality etc. For example, it has been observed that the Omicron variant is more infectious than the Delta variant but less fatal, and consequently, less hospitalization due to Omicron is reported, though the number of infected cases was more during the third wave time. Apart from this fact, the effect of vaccinations -first, second or booster dosagemay also play a significant role on the possibility of infection, degree of infection and various issues related to the fourth wave. The findings from this study are aimed to help and sensitize the people. For example, a few countries including the Government of India have started to provide Booster dose to a section of people, which may reduce the impact of the fourth wave in a long run. Overall, it should be mentioned that the forecast may be affected by all these reasons in the future.",

Hence, the conventional least squares methodology may not be able to achieve a good fit for the data. Also, the graphs for different countries seem to have some perturbations around the main waves. Therefore, a generalized approach involving polynomial regression model may not be possible due to the chance of over-fitting in some cases. However, the plots suggest that the individual waves seem to have similar plots, and hence, fitting a probabilistic model seems to be a good idea. Now, an important question is which probabilistic model will be a better fit to the data? Also, looking at the waves of India and other countries, the distribution of daily cases look like they are normally distributed around the peak dates of individual waves.

Afterwards, it applies on the summary statistics such as variation, standard deviation, mean, and so forth to get replicates. We will use 'mean' to generate our bootstrap replicates.
