This study investigated whether national public health institutes (NPHIs) unify agendas and actors, how this can be achieved, and what factors contribute to success. We conducted semi-structured interviews with 24 public health leaders from 18 countries in six WHO regions between 2019 and 2020. Respondents described how NPHIs bridge agendas reporting five strategies that institutes employ: serving as a trusted scientific advisor; convening actors across and within sectors; prioritizing transdisciplinary approaches; integrating public health infrastructures, and training that builds public health capacity. Findings also revealed five enabling factors critical to success: a strong legal foundation; scientific independence; public trust and legitimacy; networks and partnerships at global, national, and local levels; and stable funding. The Covid-19 pandemic underscores the urgency of securing scientific independence and promoting national institutes' responsiveness to public health challenges.",

As of February 2022, 220 countries and territories have reported more than 460 million confirmed cases and over 6 million deaths [1] . The devastating impact of this pandemic has been compounded by severe economic repercussions further underscoring the world's shared vulnerability. Public health emergencies of international concern demand coordination and collaboration among multiple agendas and actors including those central to the World Health Organization's (WHO) triple billion goals: health security, universal health coverage, and health promotion. WHO's aim is to ensure one billion more people benefit from universal health coverage, one billion more are better protected from health emergencies, and one billion more improve their health and well-being [2] . Moving towards these targets by 2023 and advancing work on the Sustainable Development goals will depend on individual countries' ability to address all three agendas. In resource-constrained settings, it is even more imperative that solutions are synergistic across agendas.",

NPHIs are increasingly recognized for their contributions during health emergencies [4, 5] and tackling enduring national and global health challenges [6] . Previous experience from SARS and Ebola led to investment in creating NPHIs or merging existing agencies into single consolidated entities. In the aftermath of SARS, for example, Hong Kong and Canada established NPHIs in response to national recommendations citing the need for improved coordination, national guidance, and leadership [7, 8] . Similarly, Liberia and Sierra Leone created agencies to lead their country's public health efforts after the 2014 Ebola outbreak [9, 10] . Several publications have made the case for building capacity through investments in national public health institutes to strengthen nationally owned and led responses to epidemic preparedness [11] [12] [13] .

Consultation with co-authors and a purposive strategy guided informant selection to attain representation by gender, geographic location, organizational maturity, size, and country-level economic status. We contacted potential candidates by email and invited them to participate. We did not reject or exclude any potential informants from participation although some were unresponsive despite several email follow-up attempts. We chose selection criteria to include perspectives from single NPHIs, networked agencies, and country settings without designated NPHIs. We conducted interviews by teleconference (n = 19) and face to face (n = 5). Before the interview, we sent participants a project summary, informed consent form, and list of questions (see Appendix 2) . Two authors (SLM and AB) with previous interview experience conducted the interviews, all in English except two using interpreters. We considered issues related to researcher reflexivity in advance. We conducted interviews from November 2019 to February 2020. According to the project timeline, we conducted no interviews after February. The first interview pilot test of the interview guide resulted in minor modifications. We audiotaped and transcribed all interviews. Participants received transcript copies and were provided an opportunity to correct them. Interview length ranged from 30 to 75 min.",

Two countries have taken steps to establish NPHIs: Zimbabwe published a statutory instrument for a NPHI in July 2020 [20] and South Africa passed a law for a NPHI in August 2020 [21] . Observers have long recognized the value of NPHIs as health security focal points [22] [23] [24] . Engagement and support for universal health coverage and health promotion are consistent with research reporting that mature NPHIs, having accrued capacity and resources, adopt broader mandates with multiple agendas while fledging institutions have more limited scope that develops over time [25] . Our findings include several ways that NPHIs bridge global health agendas. Five actionable strategies demonstrate how NPHIs have drawn on their inherent core assets including their capacity for serving as a trusted scientific advisor to inform decision making; multisectoral convening; multidisciplinary approaches; multi-use infrastructure; and training. Regarding provision of scientific advice, the COVID-19 pandemic has shown how critical it is that NPHIs maintain scientific independence to provide data and evidence to inform decision making. Yet during this pandemic, examples may be found to the contrary where politically motivated actors have sidelined, suppressed, silenced, and scapegoated NPHIs, thus, exposing the tenuousness of scientific autonomy. Given that scientific independence forms the foundation of public trust [26] , greater efforts will be needed to safeguard NPHIs' ability to provide science-based advice to policymakers and the public. Scientific quality, integrity, and excellence are also vitally important in building public trust.",

The urgency of NPHIs to access data sources for preparedness purposes raises similar issues on the value of 'integrated science' [29] .

A limitation of the study is the low representation from regions with few NPHIs (that is, Southeast Asia, Western Pacific). Other limitations concern the key informant recruitment process. While the selection process aimed to gather views from different geographic regions and institutional perspectives (staff size and NPHI maturity), using a snowball strategy may introduce selection bias by inadvertently acquiring individuals with similar beliefs and views. In addition, under-representation of women in our sample suggests that men often hold NPHI leadership positions in LMIC settings. Future research should investigate further perspectives from public health leaders in LMICs that have not established NPHIs.",
