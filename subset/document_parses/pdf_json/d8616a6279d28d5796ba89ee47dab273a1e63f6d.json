The model is presented by a mixed system of ordinary differential equations, algebraic relations and a single partial differential equation, which, written together, can be viewed as an underdetermined differential algebraic equation with a partial differential equation attached. Using the tools of the differential algebraic equation theory, we reveal some important qualitative properties of this system, such as its existence domain, and propose a numerical method for its solution. The numerical experiments demonstrated that within the found existence domain the mathematical model adequately represents real-life boiling processes that occur in the experimental setup.",

            "text": "Many technical systems and processes can be described by mathematical models in the form of differential algebraic equations (DAEs). Generally speaking, a DAE is a generalization of ordinary differential equations and can be viewed as an incomplete system of differential equations closed with a set of algebraic relations. DAEs have received much attention due to a wide range applications in electric circuits simulation [1] [2] [3] , mechanics of multibody systems [4] [5] [6] , flow networks [7, 8] , etc. The complete coverage of the topic can be found, for example, in [9] [10] [11] [12] and the references therein. In this paper, we focus on a particular case of DAEs that arises as a mathematical model of boiling of subcooled liquid in a steam generating channel of an experimental unit. This model appears to be an underdetermined DAE with a partial differential equation attached to it. We present a qualitative analysis of this particular system and reveal some important properties of underdetermined DAEs. We propose a numerical method that takes into consideration all important features of the model and discuss the compliance of the results of numerical experiments with the real-life process.",

If we could not express the function \u2202T \u2202z |z=0 via the other seven components of the vector-function u(t), we would have to rely only on experimental observations. The practical meaning of studying the model (1) is ensued by the recently discovered heat transfer enhancement under conditions of the rapidly oscillating interface. It was shown in [13] [14] [15] [16] that this enhancement is mainly associated with the short-term presence of a metastable liquid on a metal surface. The direct experimental observation and analysis of the dynamics of such processes are limited in view of the smallness of time periods and the geometric dimensions of the objects. Therefore, one of the most important tools in this area is the numerical integration of the equations that comprise the mathematical model.",
