The most important manifestation of COVID-19 was ARDS-like lung injury at first, but the involvement of other organs, such as kidney, heart, liver, and skin, was gradually reported. It is important to report and share all atypical manifestations of this disease to help other physicians to gain more knowledge about this new viral disease. As mentioned, there are also studies that show different types of cutaneous involvement in these patients, but due to the lack of more detailed studies in this field, and on the other hand, the possible usefulness of skin lesions as a diagnostic or alarming sign in the COVID-19 era, in this study we report a COVID-19 patient with a large hemorrhagic blister similar to sepsis-induced skin lesion. Despite the lack of common symptoms of the disease, the lung scan of the patient was positive for COVID-19.",

The clinical spectrum of COVID-19 ranges from asymptomatic to symptomatic forms with subclinical or severe respiratory failure that require special care and include systemic sepsis, septic shock, and various syndromes involved in the functioning of the body. Common clinical symptoms include fever, cough, shortness of breath, fatigue, normal or decreased leukocytes, and pneumonia seen on radiographs. Other less common symptoms include headache, sore throat, and rhinorrhea (2) . A small number of patients may experience nausea and diarrhea; and symptoms that are more alarming need special care immediately after onset, which include persistent chest pain or pressure, breathing problems, confusion and bruising of the lips or face, and ad-vanced conditions that lead to pneumonia (3). The symptoms of the disease are similar in some cases. However, studies have shown that patients sometimes present with completely different symptoms and even with the symptoms of other diseases (4), and the doctor accidentally notices an involvement in lungs in patients with COVID-19 (5, 6), Also, in this disease, early diagnosis of suspicious people and the patient makes it possible to prevent further spread of the disease by timely treatment and discontinuation of the transmission chain.",

She was initially visited with coagulation disorder and extensive sepsis bleeding, and COVID-19 disease was diagnosed for her during the additional examinations through a lung scan. So far, there have been few reports of skin lesions resulted by COVID-19 worldwide and in Italy (7), which was one of the centers of the disease. In Recalcati et al study on COVID-19 patients, there were a number of patients with skin manifestations like erythematous rash, extensive urticaria, rashes such as chickenpox and sometimes pruritus after hospitalization. The lesions usually healed within a few days. Studies at Medical Center (UNMC) at the Department of Dermatology of University of Nebraska showed that the existence of the skin rashes in 0.2% to 1.2% of the 1099 patients with COVID-19 in the laboratory by January 29, 3 2020, was confirmed in China (8-10), some of which had skin lesions since the beginning of the disease and some others at the time of hospitalization. Est\u00e9banez et al (11) also examined skin lesions in these patients in the study of the clinical features of COVID-19 and studied a 28-yearold woman without the previous medical history who visited the hospital with symptoms of COVID-19. The patient had erythematous plaques in the heel area that had become more severe over time. Recently, vascular injury and thrombotic events, especially in critical COVID-19 patients, have been reported in some studies, some of these patients also had cutaneous manifestations. These studies proposed the hyperactive immunological responses and cytokine storm in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 (12, 13) . In the case we reported, the lesions were the same as the coagulation disorder manifestation and extensive sepsis sign, which may be produced due to immune responses to COVID-19 and a history of diabetes.",
