Although such methods are unsustainable and prone to contamination, animal-free production methods have not emerged as competitive alternatives due to complexities in scale-up, requirement for multiple stages and cost of co-factors and purification. Here, we demonstrate the development of single microbial cell factories capable of complete, one-step biosynthesis of chondroitin sulfate (CS), a type of GAG. We engineer E. coli to produce all three required components for CS production-chondroitin, sulfate donor and sulfotransferase. In this way, we achieve intracellular CS production of~27 \u03bcg/g dry-cell-weight with about 96% of the disaccharides sulfated. We further explore four different factors that can affect the sulfation levels of this microbial product. Overall, this is a demonstration of simple, one-step microbial production of a sulfated GAG and marks an important step in the animal-free production of these molecules.",

Since the 1940s, heparin has predominated as the primary anticoagulant used in medicine 2 . CS, the most abundant GAG in the human body, is an important component of joint tissues and is frequently used in the treatment of osteoarthritis 3, 4 . Since they are exclusively present in animals, all GAGs are currently commercially manufactured by extraction from animal tissues, primarily from bovine trachea and porcine intestinal mucosa. Prime producers of pig and cattle, such as China, dominate the manufacturing and marketing of GAGs. These sulfated polysaccharides always occur as mixtures in tissues with individual components varying slightly in stereochemistry, length, and sulfation pattern 5 . Such small analytical differences are both a blessing and a curse; they result in remarkably distinct biological function and in vivo behavior; however, they also make their adulteration very hard to detect. Contamination incidents like the heparin adulteration crisis of 2008 [6] [7] [8] and FDA's warning about questionable crude GAG sources in 2017 9 have evoked a major conversation about the deficiencies of current production methods, regulatory practices, and analytical detection methods of adulterants/contaminants in GAGs.",

The potentials of such properties have created additional demands for the sustainable availability of pure, chemically defined GAGs.

Escherichia coli is a model organism heavily used in the production of recombinant products and non-native metabolites due to its genetic tractability and ease of scale-up. In this study, we describe the development of a metabolically engineered E. coli strain for the complete biosynthesis of animal-free CS (Fig. 1b) .

These enzymes transferases of animal origin that undergo posttranslational glycosylation and are present in Golgi apparatus with no identified microbial counterparts. This requires that they be expressed as heterologous proteins. While different chondroitin sulfotransferases give rise to different forms of CS, in the current study, we focus on one homolog of this class, chondroitin-4-O-sulfotransferase (S w ) that results in the production of the 4-O-sulfated CS-A. E. coli K4 was selected to assemble the required elements for CS biosynthesis. This strain has been extensively studied for chondroitin production 24, [29] [30] [31] . However, K4 produces a fructosylated chondroitin as part of its capsular polysaccharide. The fructosyltransferase, responsible for fructosylation of chondroitin's GlcA residues at the 3-position, is unfavorable for CS production. For this reason, we first deleted the fructosyltransferase-encoding gene, thereby resulting in the generation of non-fructosylated chondroitin in E. coli K4 32, 33 . We also integrated the T7 RNA polymerase into the genomic lacZ site in E. coli K4 \u0394kfoE, generating K4 \u0394kfoE (DE3), to facilitate the expression of recombinant genes under the stronger T7 promoter system (Supplementary Figure 1) .",

In our first attempt to enable CS synthesis, we simply added the missing sulfotransferase component to K4 \u0394kfoE (DE3) by expressing S w via the pETM6-S w plasmid. However, no CS synthesis was observed (Fig. 2a) . Sulfation of chondroitin to CS requires PAPS, which is the universal sulfate donor responsible for most biological sulfation processes. PAPS biosynthesis is a subset of the ubiquitous cysteine/methionine biosynthetic pathways, and therefore, is present in almost all cell types, including E. coli. Due to the presence of high levels of chondroitin and previously demonstrated successful S w expression, we hypothesized that the lack of CS production was due to limitations in intracellular PAPS 50 . PAPS biosynthesis involves a two-step activation of inorganic sulfate onto ATP catalyzed by ATP sulfurylase (cysDN) and APS kinase (cysC) (Fig. 2b) . However, the native pathway also consists of PAPS reductase (cysH) that competes with sulfotransferases and reduces PAPS to inorganic sulfite (Fig. 2b) .",

            "text": "As a result of kfoE and cysH deletions and S w overexpression, CS sulfation yield reached~19%, which is lower than that in animalextracted CS-A. Thus, there is room for improvement Overexpression of other PAPS biosynthetic genes (cysDNCQ) in the K4\u0394kfoE\u0394cysH(DE3) significantly reduced the sulfation of chondroitin (Fig. 2c) . Lack of success in this strategy also suggests that using a strain that responds to cysH deletion with higher PAPS accumulation might lead to higher CS sulfation. Since our previously developed E. coli MG1655\u0394cysH(DE3) 34 accumulated about 54-fold higher (~0.8 \u03bcmoles/gDCW) PAPS than K4\u0394kfoE\u0394cysH(DE3), we also explored CS synthesis in this strain. Chondroitin production in MG1655\u0394cysH(DE3) was enabled by expression of the K4 genes, kfoC, kfoA, and kfoF through the plasmid pETM6-PCAF, previously constructed in our lab 31 . Furthermore, the assembly of all three components in MG1655\u0394cysH(DE3) by co-expression of S w (pETM6-PCAFS w ) led to a high intracellular CS sulfation level of 58% (Fig. 2d) . The metabolic cost of S w expression was also observed in the form of a decrease in total CS. Improving sulfotransferase activity enhances CS sulfation. Chondroitin sulfotransferases are Golgi-based, integral transmembrane glycoproteins. These enzymes must be truncated, correctly folded and expressed in a soluble form in order to be effective catalysts for E. coli-based CS synthesis 35 . Based on the hypothesis that increased solubility and stability of S w would improve CS sulfation levels, we relied on a computational approach to identify mutations enhancing these properties. A web-based server called Protein Repair One Stop Shop (PROSS) utilizes sequence and structure information of proteins to identify residue mutations that would result in enhanced expession and solubility 36 . While the sequence of human S w was known based on our previous work on its expression in E. coli and P. pastoris, a structure is not yet available in the protein databank. Hence, we constructed a homology model of S w structure to use in PROSS that is based on the previously elucidated structure of the sulfotransferase domain of an olefin synthase from Synechococcus PCC 7002 (RMSD of 0.74). The sequence alignment of S w with the template is shown in Supplementary Figure 2a . From our analysis using the PROSS server, we were able to identify three variants of S w , each containing multiple mutations across the sequence (Sequences in Supplementary Table 4 ). The mutants are named S M1 (H127E S238Y), S M2 (K117R H127E S238Y A245G), and S M4 (I7A R30Q Q106E K117R S118N H127E I146T S226A S237D S238Y A245G E272Q). All of the predicted mutations were at solvent accessible residues, distant from the active site of the enzyme (Fig. 3a) . Mutations I7A, R30Q, Q106E, S118N, H127E, I146T, S226A, S237D, S238Y, E272Q resulted in a modified charge distribution at these solvent accessible positions (Sequence Alignments in Supplementary Figure 2a) .",

While all three mutants demonstrated enhanced in vitro sulfotransferase activity compared to S w ( Fig. 3b and Supplementary Fig. 7 ), S M2 demonstrated the highest conversion. Transformation of the mutant plasmids into K4\u0394kfoE\u0394cysH(DE3) (PAPS-accumulator and chondroitin-producer) helped verify the effect of these mutants on in vivo constructs. Expression of S M1 and S M4 did not result in significantly different intracellular sulfation levels compared to S w . In contrast, S M2 produced CS with a three-fold increased sulfation (Fig. 3c) . The disparity between the in vitro and the corresponding in vivo activities (Sw(in vitro) vs. Sw(in vivo); SM1 (in vitro) vs. SM1(in vivo); etc.) could be attributed to differences in the levels of expressed chondroitin-4-O-sulfotransferase and/or the chondroitin and PAPS substrates in the respective experiments. Another noteworthy aspect is the difference in the sulfation level of S w while expressed using pET32LIC (Fig. 3c ) and pETM6 (Fig. 2a) . The intracellular level of sulfation obtained by pET32LIC-S w , was 4-to 6-fold lower than that obtained by pETM6-S w depending on expression temperature (Supplementary Figure 3 ). While both these plasmids have similar backbones, the same origin of replication, and antibiotic resistance, the pET32LIC version expresses the enzyme with N-terminal Trx and His tags. In contrast, pETM6 expresses the enzyme sequence without the tags and is also a plasmid backbone generally used in metabolic engineering studies.",

To explore the effect of induction on in vivo sulfation, K4\u0394kfoE\u0394cysH(DE3) pETM6-S w was grown and induced for S w expression with IPTG at different growth stages (Fig. 4a) . Induction at 0.6 OD 600 and 1.0 OD 600 was deemed optimal since they both resulted in significantly higher amounts of CS and higher levels of sulfation (Fig. 4b) . Hence, both these induction points were further tested for optimal inducer concentration (0.5 mM (low) and 1.0 mM (high) [IPTG]) and optimal expression temperature (37\u00b0C, 20\u00b0C, and 16\u00b0C) ( with either low or high IPTG concentration and expressed at 20\u00b0C for 12 h and cultures induced at 0.6 OD 600 with high IPTG concentration and expressed at 16\u00b0C for 24 h.

Previous studies have shown that the majority of unsulfated chondroitin produced is exported to the medium 40 . In the current study, we observed that CS, unlike unsulfated chondroitin, was not present in the extracellular medium. Instead, all reported CS production was intracellular. While our experiments point to strategies to improve intracellular sulfation, the bulk of the polysaccharide was both secreted and completely unsulfated (Supplementary Table 1 ). This led us to examine the possibility that the export of the unsulfated chondroitin is in competition with its sulfation and CS production. We employed CRISPRi-based repression of the transporter genes to verify the effect of decreasing transport activity on intracellular sulfation. The currently accepted mechanism of GAG transport in E. coli K4 involves an ABC membrane transporter complex formed by four proteins, KpsT, KpsM, KpsD, and KpsE 41 (Fig. 5a) . KpsT is an ATPase that complexes with an inner membrane permease, KpsM. KpsD and KpsE each form dimeric periplasm and membrane-spanning complexes that facilitate the export of the polysaccharide 41 .",

While some studies describe such expression attempts with carbohydrate sulfotransferases 35, 51, 56 , they have only further employed them in vitro for metabolite production. In the case of chondroitin sulfotransferases, rational protein design is currently limited by the lack of structural information. This study relied on a homology model based on the known structure of a different enzyme, a sulfotransferase component of olefin synthase 53 . This enzyme has a low sequence similarity to chondroitin sulfotransferase. Despite this limitation, the PROSS server predicted improved mutants (Fig. 3) . It is noteworthy that the PROSSpredicted mutations, aimed at increasing stability and solubility, provided a three-fold enhancement of in vivo CS sulfation. This highlights the potential of more highly targeted enzyme engineering to further improve in vivo sulfation.",

Continuing growth at 37\u00b0C post-induction resulted in no CS sulfation irrespective of induction OD 600 or inducer concentration indicating poor expression of active S w at higher temperatures. Likewise, incubation at lower temperatures from the start of the fermentation resulted in slow growth and in minimal sulfation. Hence, dropping the temperature to 20\u00b0C or 16\u00b0C upon induction was critical for in vivo sulfation. Expression at 16\u00b0C resulted in improved CS sulfation in cultures induced at 0.6 OD 600 , while expression at 20\u00b0C resulted in improved sulfation for cultures induced at 1.0 OD 600 (Fig. 4) . In contrast to sulfotransferase expression, the production and export of chondroitin is relatively straightforward and is optimal at 37\u00b0C. In addition to engineering sulfotransferases for better in vivo activity, future studies should also aim at engineering precursor production and CS export to work optimally through a range of temperatures.",

The GAG transporter genes kpsT and kpsM are located in region III of the capsular polysaccharide gene cluster of E. coli K4 under the control of a thermoregulated promoter 41 . Hence it is possible that the temperature drop used for sulfotransferase expression represses the export of CS. This temperature effect together with CRISPRi-based kpsM repression, could significantly impede CS export, thereby allowing more time for the sulfation of chondroitin. This is consistent with the three-fold increase in sulfation of chondroitin observed in this strain. However, this metabolic design rules out CS secretion, making the approach less attractive for scale-up and downstream processing. Future studies should take into account strain designs that can slow down export while not eliminating it completely.",
