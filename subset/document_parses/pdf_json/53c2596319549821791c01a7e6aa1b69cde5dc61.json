To prevent and control different types of diseases as well as their complex variants, research on the spatio-temporal differentiation among and mechanisms of influence of epidemic diseases is growing worldwide. This study analyzed monthly data on the incidence of influenza by using different methods, including Moran's I, the hotspot analysis model, concentration analysis, and correlation analysis, to determine the characteristics of spatiotemporal differentiation in the incidence of influenza across prefecture-level cities in China from 2004 to 2017, and to examine its relationship with air pollution. According to the results, the overall incidence of influenza in China exhibited a trend of increase from 2004 to 2017, with small peaks in 2009 and 2014. More cases of influenza were recorded in the first and fourth quarters of each year. Regions with higher incidences of influenza were concentrated in northwestern and northern China, and in the coastal areas of southeastern China. Over time, the distribution of regions with a higher incidence of influenza has shifted from the west to the east of the country. A significant relationship was observed between the incidence of influenza and factors related to air pollution. The contents of five air pollutants (PM 2.5 , PM 10 , SO 2 , NO 2 , and CO) were significantly positively correlated with the incidence of influenza, with a decreasing order of contribution to it of SO 2 > CO > NO 2 > PM 2.5 > PM 10 . The content of O 3 in the air was negatively correlated with the incidence of influenza. The influence of air pollution-related factors on the incidence of influenza in different regions and seasons showed minor differences. The large-scale empirical results provided here can supply a scientific basis for governmental disease control authorities to formulate strategies for regional prevention and control.",

            "text": "The rapid pace of industrialization and urbanization has led to drastic changes in the modes of production, people's lifestyle, and the environment that have profound impacts on human health and the spectrum of dis-eases threatening it. This state of affairs has increased the instability, complexity, and vulnerability of the national health system in China (Yang et al., 2018) . Diseases that can turn into pandemics are increasing in variety. Influenza (or the flu) is an acute respiratory infectious disease caused by the influenza virus that spreads through the air (National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China, 2020) . It is highly infectious, transmits quickly, and can easily lead to outbreaks and even pandemics (Hilleman, 2002) . Influenza outbreaks harm human health and impose a heavy economic burden, and thus are a serious global public health problem (Jamieson et al., 2009; Matus et al., 2012; Bhuiyan et al., 2014; Putri et al., 2018) . According to the World Health Organization (WHO), seasonal influenza epidemics cause 650 000 deaths across the world each year, equivalent to a person dying from influenza every 48 seconds (WHO, 2018) . The incidence rate and mortality rate of influenza are relatively low, compared with other infectious diseases with the highest annual incidence rate: hand foot mouth disease, hepatitis B, tuberculosis and other infectious diarrhea and the highest annual mortality rate: tuberculosis, rabies, AIDS (Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome) and viral hepatitis from 2002 to 2017, but the trend has been increasing in recent years (Li and Zhu, 2019) . The Healthy China Initiative is a significant health strategy being pursued by the country (The Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, 2019). It involves strengthening the prevention and control of severe infectious diseases, improving the monitoring of and early warning mechanism for infectious diseases, and improving urban air quality nationwide to ensure that it accords with the relevant standards. In light of these goals, regional differences in the incidence of influenza, the effect of poisonous and harmful pollutants on human health, the specific relationship between influenza and changes in air pollution-related factors, and targeted measures for regional environmental governance to mitigate the effects of infectious diseases are issues that need to be systematically studied.",

The agglomeration of influenza (Chen et al., 2011; Lee and Wong, 2011; Yang et al., 2011) and the epidemiological characteristics of its occurrence differ significantly at different spatial scales. Scholars have focused on analyzing the scale of diseases in regions of different sizes. Systematic long-term and small-scale epidemiological data for China are lacking, and the analysis of the impact of environmental factors, such as air pollution, on diseases in the country has been limited. Medical workers have used statistical analysis to describe the epidemiological characteristics and social burden of influenza and other diseases. Analytical research on spatial differences among the incidences of influenza and natural factors influencing them is still in its infancy. To address this gap in research, this study collected data on the incidence of influenza and air pollution in China. We used Moran's I, the hotspot analysis model, concentration analysis, and Spearman's rank correlation analysis to study the characteristics of the spatio-temporal distribution of and factors influencing the spread of influenza. This study has three aims: 1) to provide large-scale empirical data on influenza that can be used for health geography, 2) to determine the mechanism of influence of air pollution-related factors on the incidence of influenza from multiple perspectives and identify its spatio-temporal evolution, and 3) to provide insights that can be used by disease control authorities to formulate regional prevention and control strategies, and provide theoretical support for the implementation of the Healthy China Initiative.",

The research period ranged from 2004 to 2017. The collected information included data on the incidence of influenza and air quality, and maps. Monthly data on the incidence of influenza in prefectural cities were used. All reported data were used as samples to analyze the spatial and temporal characteristics of the incidence of influenza. The number of cities for which annual data on the incidence of influenza were available increased from 257 in 2004 to 367 in 2017. The data were drawn from Data Center of China Public Health Science, part of China Center for Disease Control and Prevention (http://www.phsciencedata.cn/share/). Given the small number of deaths recorded, data on only the number of cases of influenza were used, where incidence = the number of cases \u00d7 100 000 people. Statistical data for some regions for a number of years were missing, because of which the data on influenza were not spatially continuous. The missing data were set as blank, without interpolation. The layers of data for administrative maps of prefecture-level cities were obtained from the Geographic Information Bureau of the State Bureau of Surveying and Mapping. Pollutant indices for air quality were obtained from the real-time air quality monitoring data published by the China National Environmental Monitoring Center (http://www.cnemc.cn/), and included data on fine particulate matter (PM 2.5 ), inhalable particulate matter (PM 10 ), sulfur dioxide (SO 2 ), nitrogen dioxide (NO 2 ), ozone (O 3 ), and carbon monoxide (CO). A total of 190 cities were monitored daily for air quality in 2014 and 366 in 2015-2017, and the monthly mean value for each was calculated from the daily data. When analyzing the relationship between air pollution and the incidence of influenza, cities for which data on air quality and the incidence of influenza were available were selected as samples. The numbers of samples (cities) used for 2014 to 2017 were 160, 327, 328, and 330, respectively. The differences in the numbers of samples between years affected statistical efficiency but did not compromise the statistical inferences made because the total coverage was large enough.",

This coefficient has no requirements regarding the selection of raw data, the form of the correlation, and the pattern of distribution. It is typically used to measure the strength of a monotonic relationship or rank correlation between variables. Its universality and robustness are better than those of Pearson's product moment correlation coefficient with the parametric property (Spearman, 1904 ). The characteristics of occurrence of influenza in some provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions differed substantially from the rest. For example, Beijing showed the largest annual differences, and had a much higher incidence of influenza than the other provinces, municipality and autonomous in China in 2014 and 2017. From 2014 to 2017, the incidence in Guangdong was two to three times higher than the national average. These substantial differences were based not only on the outbreak of influenza in 2017, but also on the number of data samples obtained from this region. That is, Guangdong might have recorded an increase in cases of influenza due to more testing and fewer missed diagnoses than the other regions. Table 1 shows that the concentration of the incidence of influenza in China was mostly in the range of [0.3, 0.5), only slightly higher than that of 0.5 in 2009. This indic- A comparison of the monthly data ( Fig. 2) showed that the incidence of influenza was mainly concentrated in the first and fourth quarters of each year, i.e., a period of higher incidence and susceptibility lasted from November of each given year to March of the following year. This might be because the transmission of the influenza virus by aerosol depends on the temperature and relative humidity. The low temperature and relative humidity in winter are more conducive to the transmission of influenza than in summer (Ma et al., 2019) . In 2009 and 2016-2017, irregular fluctuations occurred, with a higher incidence of influenza than during the stable period. Its incidence in December 2017 was significantly higher than in the corresponding month in other years, which was related to the increase of influenza virus types in winter in 2017 (World Health Organization, 2017). Fig. 3 shows a clear differentiation in spatial patterns of the incidence of influenza in China, and substantial changes occurred during the study period. Regions with a higher incidence of influenza tended to shift from the west to the east of the country over time, and the degree of its concentration increased. On the contrary, northeastern China continued to have a lower incidence. From 2004 to 2009, the incidence of influenza in southwestern, northwestern, and northern China were consistently higher than the national average. In 2009, the na-tionwide incidence (except in the northeastern China) was the highest during [2004] [2005] [2006] [2007] [2008] [2009] , and the number of areas with a higher incidence than the average was the largest during this period. During 2010-2017, the number of regions, provinces, and cities with higher incidences was far greater than in the previous five years. The incidence of influenza was relatively higher in north, south, east, central, and northwest China. At the provincial level, Xinjiang, Beijing, Inner Mongolia, Hebei (Handan), Tibet, Guangxi, and Guangdong had significantly higher incidences of influenza during the study period. This might have been related to the rapid economic development and increase in the number of factories in recent years. Table 2 shows the global Moran's I for the incidence of influenza and the results of the corresponding significance test for China in 2004-2017. Moran's I was higher than 0.2 and the Z-value was greater than the critical value of 1.96 for the normal distribution function at a significance level of 0.05 only in 2014, 2016, and 2017, i.e., it passed the significance test and was statistically significant in these years. This indicates that the incidence of influenza exhibited a certain spatial autocorrelation and agglomeration. However, the global Moran's I for the incidence of influenza from 2004 to 2013 and in 2015 did not exceed 0.2, indicating that the global spatial autocorrelation was not strong in these years and the interregional spatial difference in influenza was insignificant, showing a random distribution. Fig. 4 shows the characteristics of the local spatial autocorrelation for the incidence of influenza through the detection of hotspots for the flu. Areas with a regional agglomeration of incidence of influenza were registered in each year. From 2004 to 2009, significant hotspots with higher incidences formed in Xinjiang, Tibet, and Gansu, while areas with few cases were concentrated in Hebei, Henan, Jilin, and Shandong. From 2010 to 2017, the hotspots gradually shifted eastward from Shaanxi, Shanxi, Beijing, and Hebei to Guangdong, Fujian, and Guangxi, while areas with low incidence were concentrated in Sichuan, Guizhou, Heilongjiang, Jilin, and Liaoning. In general, hotspots of influenza tended to shift from the northwest to the southeast, possibly owing to the limited economic development of western regions of China earlier on. In the later period, eastern re- gions might have suffered from a higher agglomeration of influenza owing to a higher population density and faster spread of pathogens, with cities such as Zhuhai, Zhongshan, and Huizhou having a higher agglomeration and incidence of influenza.",

Six air pollutants-PM 2.5 , PM 10 , SO 2 , NO 2 , O 3 , and CO-were selected as factors influencing the incidence of influenza here based on the results of previous studies for which data were available. To ensure the consistency and integrity of the statistical data range, only the period from 2014 to 2017 was selected to examine these factors. Because not all results of correlation passed the Shapiro-Wilk test, the Spearman rank correlation analysis was used to evaluate their mutual effects as it did not have any requirement regarding the distribution of the raw data. The value of the correlation coefficient varied depending on the spatial scale of the research problem or the basic unit of geographical analysis used, where this is the modifiable areal unit problem (MAUP) (Robinson, 1950; Shi and Wang, 2016) . Owing to the large span from the north to the south of China, the geographical conditions and related factors are significantly different, because of which the selection of different spatial scales for analysis leads to different results. Therefore, it was necessary to use a method with an independent scale to carry out statistical reasoning. To reduce the influence of the MAUP as much as possible, three spatial scales (national, provincial, and prefecture-level cities) were used to quantitatively describe the relation between influenza and air pollution.",

The results indicate that the rank correlation coefficients were lower than 0.3 in each year, indicating a very weak correlation. The P-values were mostly less than 0.01, and led us to reject the null hypothesis that factors influencing the air quality were not related to the incidence of influenza, i.e., the occurrence of influenza was positively correlated with concentrations of PM 2.5 , PM 10 , SO 2 , NO 2 , and CO at the national level. However, it showed a very weak negative correlation with the concentration of O 3 because the annual averages of air pollution and the incidence of influenza were too general, and specific phenomena in small areas were neglected. Therefore, correlation analyses at the national level were used only to compare differences at other spatial scales, and had no reference significance. Fig. 5 shows the correlation coefficients between the incidence of influenza and air pollution for each province of China. A total of 52% of the results passed the significance test during the study period. The correlation between the incidence of influenza and air pollution was concentrated in the range from \u22120.5 to 0.5 in a majority of provinces in China. The values of PM 2.5 , PM 10 , SO 2 , NO 2 , and CO were generally higher than zero, indicating a positive correlation with influenza. The values of SO 2 and NO 2 indicated the highest influence. More than half of the correlation values for O 3 were lower than 0, indicating a negative correlation with the incidence of influenza. The correlations between the overall incidence of influenza and air pollution were mostly above 0.5 with a stronger correlation in Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Jiangsu, Ningxia, and Shaanxi. The results for Shanghai in 2016 were the most significant, i.e., values of the correlation of influenza with SO 2 , PM 2.5 , PM 10 , NO 2 , and O 3 were 0.92, 0.75, 0.71, 0.89, and \u22120.73, respectively. Correlations between the incidence of influenza and SO 2 concentrations were also significant in Beijing and Tianjin. The statistical results for Tibet, Hainan, Inner Mongolia, Chongqing, Sichuan, and Anhui did not pass the significance test. Regions with significant correlations were mainly located in the Yangtze River Delta, Beijing, Tianjin, Shaanxi, Gansu, and Ningxia. Most of them had higher incidences of influenza owing to severe air pollution. Fig. 6 shows the correlation coefficients between the incidence of influenza and air pollution in each prefecturelevel city in China, and the results with p-values of less Notes: ** P < 0.01 significance level; * P < 0.05 significance level than 0.05 were retained. It is clear that the correlation coefficients between the concentrations of PM 2.5 , PM 10 , SO 2 , NO 2 , CO, and O 3 , and the incidence of influenza were all above 0.5. The first five factors had positive values, with the maximum and minimum values in the range (0.5,1.0], and median values mostly concentrated around 0.75, indicating a strong correlation. Its correlations with the concentration of O 3 had negative values, with a median value concentrated around \u22120.750 and indicating a negative correlation. We compared the degrees of correlation between the five air pollution-related factors, which were positive correlated, with the incidence of influenza, and their absolute values showed differences that were not significant. The overall correlation between the incidence of influenza and the concentration of SO 2 was the highest, and had the highest median values (mean median of 0.795). The average median values of CO and NO 2 were 0.790 and 0.774, respectively. Those of PM 2.5 and PM 10 were smaller, at 0.764 and 0.747, respectively. The average median correlation coefficient between the content of O 3 and the incidence of influenza was \u22120.763, indicating that O 3 was significantly negatively correlated with it.",

We used data provided by Data Center of China Public Health Science, part of China Center for Disease Control and Prevention. A large number of cases of influenza recorded therein were based on clinical diagnoses, with a higher ratio of incorrect diagnosis and underreported cases (Aman A T, 2020) . This is because some carriers of influenza are asymptomatic, which makes it difficult to comprehensively find, diagnose, and report cases . A study by the US Emergency Departments found that temperatures recorded in triage were lower in the morning than in the afternoon or evening. Although there is no official rate of missed diagnosis or incorrect diagnosis of influenza in China, we need to consider this factor (Harding et al., 2020) . In addition, different statistical capacities in different years and regions, as well as missing data in some periods or regions due to adjustments in the administrative division, were registered. The data were not interpolated to ensure their authenticity. These problems with the data affected our method and process, and might have led to deviations between the obtained results and the empirical conditions. An analysis of the results of correlation between the incidence of influenza and air pollution revealed that the overall values that passed the significance test were not very high, where this may be related to the selection of large-scale and long-term data. However, the correlations were very significant in Beijing, Tianjin, and other places for which more basic data were likely provided. This is because large cities not only have large populations and incidence bases, but also have strong statistical and reporting-related precision, because of which the results of analysis of cities with more basic data were more accurate . The availability of the results also increased successively from the national and provincial to the prefecture-levelcity scales, indicating that more explicit results were obtained at finer scales.",

Past work has shown that most pollution-related factors are positively correlated with the incidence of respiratory diseases, which is consistent with the results obtained in this study, i.e., air pollution has a very significant effect on cases of influenza. After entering the human body through various pathways of exposure, pollutants can interact with different target proteins, and are absorbed by the blood and human tissues. This can severely influence the defensive function of the respiratory tract, leading to an inflammatory reaction. This is an important factor in the occurrence and spread of influenza. The results of this study show that influenza is negatively correlated with the concentration of O 3 , and may have a specific correlation with the bactericidal characteristics of O 3 . However, epidemiological studies indicate that a negative correlation cannot verify the effect of interaction between the two entities considered owing to their different times of formation. The concentration of O 3 tends to be higher in summer, and lower in autumn and winter, when a higher incidence of influenza has been noticed. Furthermore, long-term ozone inhalation has been attributed to increased morbidity and mortality owing to respiratory diseases, such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (Yang et al., 2012) . In addition, the toxic effects of a number of environmental pollutants may show a lagged effect, thus posing additional challenges for scientific research on the connection between environmental pollution and health. Although scientists from different countries have provided a fair understanding of such issues as the trend, source, migration, and transformation of pollutants as well as their harmful effects on the human body, research on the characteristics of pollution, its environmental toxicology, and the risks it poses to human health remains in its infancy.",

The use of an integrated and sustainable urban planning strategy is a priority for central and local government officials. We think that the government should formulate targeted schemes for influenza prevention and control in accordance with the characteristics of different regions. The government should pay more attention to the Pearl River Delta, eastern China, and other areas with higher incidences of influenza, as well as cities such as Zhuhai, Zhongshan, and Huizhou. In addition, more sustainable developmental policies should be instituted and enforced to reduce the effect of air pollution on long-term economic development and the health of people. Officials should be rigorous when examining and approving new projects that involve the emissions of harmful pollutants, develop modes of pollution prevention, supervision, and accountability , and establish a list of enterprises that emit polluting gases such as SO 2 , CO, and NO 2 . More attention should be paid to the sources of emission that increase the contents of PM 2.5 and PM 10 . Moreover, the government should control pollution and dust in key industries, develop green transportation, optimize the industrial structure, deepen industrial pollution control, strengthen meteorological monitoring technologies and early warning management, and regulate and control emissions according to meteorological changes in a timely manner . It should ensure an environment with an appropriate concentration of O 3 , purified air, and engage in atmospheric disinfection and sterilization. In combination with the relevant air pollution indices, a method to calculate countrywide indices representing the risk of influenza should be formulated to provide forecasts to residents and react to outbreaks in a timely manner. A national ecological compensation plan for environmental air quality should be implemented to reduce the spread of air pollution in urban areas, and administrative divisions should be used for better prevention and control of air pollution (Sun et al., 2019).",

Long-term public health monitoring and epidemiological research still needs to be carried out for further verification of the trends identified here. Second, the incidence of influenza varied significantly on a daily basis in certain months in our data, because of which the monthly analysis of its incidence might have reported fewer cases certain months. The characteristics of distribution of infectious diseases at different spatial scales were different. It is thus necessary to investigate and study the disease at different scales to fully grasp the laws of its spread. We mostly used large-and medium-scale analysis, and neglected small-scale analysis. This should be carried out in future work in the area. Third, the factors influencing the incidence of influenza in China were investigated mainly from the perspective of air pollution, without considering the significant effects of natural factors such as climate and hydrology as well as social and economic factors, such as population flow and healthcare. Finally, the secondary classification of influenza was not described in detail, and epidemiological data on the age, gender, and past medical history of patients was not included. Future research should focus on improving the quality of data, examining the comprehensive mechanisms of influence of the incidence of influenza, analyze the characteristics of spatial differentiation among populations according to epidemiological principles, and conduct a comparative spatial analysis of various epidemic diseases.",

The contents of five air pollutants -PM 2.5 , PM 10 , SO 2 , NO 2 , and CO-were positively correlated with the incidence of influenza, and the degrees of risk posed by them from the highest to the lowest were as follows: SO 2 > CO > NO 2 > PM 2.5 > PM 10 . The concentration of O 3 showed a significant negative correlation with the incidence of influenza, but also exhibited small fluctuations due to the influence of different seasons and regions.",

In 2006, it declined slightly and reached its minimum value in 2008. In 2009, it increased significantly due to the outbreak of influenza A (H1N1), then decreased, and then increased again. It fluctuated until reaching its maximum value in 2017. This was in line with the global influenza epidemic in 2017 (Du et al., 2018). The annual trend of variations in the occurrence of influenza were the same in most provinces and cities in China, and only a few provinces exhibited some differences. Most provinces, municipalities and autonomou regions registered a trend of increase, with fluctuations, and a peak in 2009, such as Ningxia and Chongqing. Three provinces in the northeastern China (Heilongjiang, Jilin and Liaoning) had slightly different trends, generally showing smaller fluctuations and lower incidence of influenza.",
