            "text": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus 2 (SARS\u2212CoV\u22122) is the pathogen of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID\u221219), a recently emerged worldwide pandemic that is causing a global health crisis. Although the urgent usage of vaccines has achieved some initial success in controlling the disease spread, targeted medicines as a therapeutic means are still indispensable [1] . Unfortunately, no SARS\u2212CoV\u22122 targeted medicine has been successfully applied clinically for the treatment of COVID\u221219 at the current stage. Nevertheless, numerous studies over the past year have made encouraging progress in developing targeted drug leads for COVID\u221219. For example, a structure\u2212based design has led to the discovery of two promising inhibitors against the main protease (M pro ) of SARS\u2212CoV\u22122, a key enzyme mediating viral replication and transcription [2, 3] . In addition to the M pro , SARS\u2212CoV\u22122 Spike protein is becoming an even more attractive target for exploiting targeted drugs. This trimeric protein protrudes from the double\u2212layered lipid envelope of the SARS\u2212CoV\u22122 virion and is responsible for viral entry into the host cell through the receptor\u2212binding domain (RBD) to recognize and bind the membrane\u2212bound monocarboxypeptidase angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) [4] . Targeting the protein\u2212protein interactions (PPIs) via competitively binding the RBD has been proved to be efficient in blocking the initial stage of virus entry. Such binders in development include engineered ACE2 decoys, monoclonal antibodies, small compounds or peptides, and vaccine\u2212elicited antibodies or convalescent serum [5] .",

            "text": "Compared with the much larger decoys and antibodies, peptides have their own advantages as therapeutic agents due to their lower cost, minimal immunogenicity and potentially lower toxicity [6, 7] . For the development of RBD\u2212targeted peptides, one strategy is to replicate the viral binding region on ACE2, essentially based on the interacting residue\u2212rich helix 1 [8] . De novo design of peptides to competitively bind RBD with ACE2 even exhibited more potency [9] . The other strategy is to screen antiviral candidates from the naturally occurring bioactive peptides. In this aspect, antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are attracting increasing attention with regard to their possibility of blocking cellular surface receptors and/or disruption of virus cell membrane at the stage of virus entry [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] . As the effectors of the innate immune system of multicellular organisms, AMPs establish the first\u2212line defense towards microbial infection and are being exploited as alternatives of conventional anti\u2212infective agents to combat bacterial and fungal infections [15] . The cathelicidin LL37 and defensins (both \u03b1\u2212 and \u03b2\u2212types) are two classes of major naturally occurring AMPs in humans that contribute to both innate and adaptive antimicrobial immunity [16] . Recent studies have identified their potential roles in resistance to SARS\u2212CoV\u22122 infection. For example, human \u03b2\u2212defensin 2 (hBD\u22122), an epithelial cell\u2212derived AMP, binds to RBD with a K D of~300 nM [17] . Human intestinal \u03b1\u2212defensin 5 (HD\u22125) and LL37 can simultaneously attach both ACE2 and the Spike protein [18] [19] [20] . A defensin\u2212like peptide P9R exhibited potent antiviral activity against multiple viruses including SARS\u2212CoV\u22122. The antiviral activity of P9R depends on the direct binding to viruses and the inhibition of virus\u2212host endosomal acidification [21] .",

Compared with the membrane\u2212disruptive linear AMPs, this class of peptides show higher stability and lower mammalian toxicity due to the presence of multiple disulfide bridges and their specific interactions with certain microbial targets [26, 27] . Micasin is such a peptide characterized from the dermatophytic fungus Microsporum canis [24] . In this work, we first studied the potential interactions of micasin and RBD through molecular docking. The results showed that this peptide could dock on the RBD receptor\u2212binding motif to form a stable complex via extensive shape complementarity. Subsequently, we experimentally validated the interactions with microscale thermophoresis (MST). Further single\u2212point mutation guided by the structural complex information to expand the interface results in a mutant with six\u2212fold higher binding affinity.",

Solvent shell thickness was 1.5 nm in a cubic box and the total charge of the simulated systems were neutralized by adding sodium or chloride ions. Simulations were performed under periodic boundary conditions and energy minimization by the steepest descent minimization algorithm with the maximum force <1000.0 kJ/mol/nm. The system was subsequently equilibrated with a two\u2212step protocol that involved a 100 ps number of particles, volume, and temperature (NVT) and a 100 ps number of particles, pressure, and temperature (NPT), in which all protein atoms were restrained to their initial position. Following these two equilibration stages, a 30 ns trajectory was simulated (i.e., production MD) with a time step of 2 fs. The modified Berendsen thermostat method was used to maintain the temperature at 300 K and pressure coupling was performed with the Parrinello\u2212Rahman algorithm for 1 bar. The Particle Mesh Ewald (PME) algorithm was used to treat long\u2212range electrostatic interactions and the Linear Constraint Solver (LINCS) algorithm to constrain all bonds. Short\u2212range electrostatic and short\u2212range van der Waals cutoffs were both 1 nm. The root mean squared deviation (RMSD) for measuring the difference of simulated structures to the structure present in the minimized, equilibrated system were calculated with the gmx rms command of Gromacs.",

The recombinant plasmid pET\u221228a\u2212RBD was transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3) for auto\u2212induction to accumulate inclusion bodies (IBs) under the direction of the T7 promoter. The IBs were then renatured by the previously described method with some modifications [32] . In brief, the auto\u2212induction overnight culture was centrifuged and the pellet was resuspended in the resuspension buffer (RB, 100 mM Tris\u2212HCl, pH 8.5 and 100 mM NaCl) followed by ultrasonic disruption to prepare bacterial lysates, from which crude IBs were collected by centrifugation. The IBs were washed twice with 2% Triton X\u2212100 in the RB buffer and then solubilized by 6 M guanidine\u2212HCl in 0.1 M Tris\u2212HCl (pH 8.5), 1 mM EDTA and 30 mM \u03b2\u2212mercaptoethanol for 1 h at room temperature. Renaturation was initiated by a 20 times of dilution of the solubilized IBs into the renaturation buffer containing 0.2 M ammonium acetate (pH 8.8), 10% glycerol and 1 M guanidine\u2212HCl. Following incubation at 16 \u2022 C overnight, the precipitates in the renaturation solution were removed by filtering with the Whatman filter papers. Subsequently, the protein solution was ultrafiltered to exchange buffer to 0.2 M ammonium acetate (pH 8.8) with a 3 kD MWCO centrifugal device (Millipore, Bedford, MA, USA). The sample was analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS\u2212PAGE).

Peak fractions were pooled and protein concentration was determined by measuring the absorbance of the protein solution at 280 nm with a UV\u2212VIS Spectrophotometer (NanoDrop2000). The sample was stored at \u221280 \u2022 C for use. The feasibility of using E. coli\u2212produced RBD for the current study is due to the fact that the RBD contains only one glycosylation site Asn\u2212343 that is remote from the RBD\u2212ACE2 interface, and thus its role in ACE2 binding can be excluded.

These two subdomains are cross\u2212linked by three disulfide bridges ( Figure 1A,B) , which confer micasin high stability, as revealed by heating at 50 \u2022 C for 4 days, not altering its CD spectra ( Figure 1C ). Using the Hex protein docking program, we generated a series of predicted complexes, from which we chose the first docking pose as the most favorable one for subsequent analysis (Figure 2A ). This choice was made because in this complex micasin and RBD form an extensive shape complementarity interface with numerous hydrophobic and hydrogen\u2212bonding interactions. Even more remarkably, as a small peptide of 4\u2212kD, micasin occupies a comparable interface area on RBD ( Figure 2B ) with ACE2 (855.9 \u00c5 2 vs. 878.7 \u00c5 2 ). Analysis of the complex with LigPlot+ revealed a great number of interacting residues involved in molecular recognition (Figures 1A and 2C ). In particular, nearly 50% micasin residues are located on the interface (i.e., Gly\u22121, Pro\u22125, Glu\u22128, Ala\u221213, Leu\u221216, Ser\u221217, Phe\u221222, Phe\u221224, and Leu\u221229 for hydrophobic interactions; and Cys\u22124, Phe\u22126, Asn\u22129, Glu\u221210, His\u221212, Lys\u221221, Gly\u221227, Pro\u221228, Arg\u221230 for hydrogen\u2212bonding interactions) (Figures 1A and 2D ). For RBD, 18 residues are located on the interface where 15 are known also to contact ACE2 and three are specific for micasin binding ( Figure 2C ), indicating that this peptide overall occupies the ACE2 position on RBD.",

Using a modified renaturation method [32] , we obtained soluble RBD protein from the E. coli inclusion bodies ( Figure S1 ). The product was further purified by size\u2212exclusion chromatography (SEC) ( Figure 3A ) and the collected peak showed a single component of 21,818.65 Da determined by HPLC\u2212Q\u2212TOF\u2212MS ( Figure 3A , inset), precisely matching the theoretical MW of RBD (21,817.49 Da) calculated from the sequence with eight hydrogens removed due to the presence of four disulfide bridges. Analytical RP\u2212HPLC showed that the recombinant RBD adopted a homogeneous conformation ( Figure 3B , inset) with a native\u2212like mixed \u03b1\u2212helix and \u03b2\u2212sheet structure, as identified by its CD spectra ( Figure 3B ) where a positive maximum at 197 nm signifies \u03b2\u2212sheet and a negative minimum around 208 nm signifies \u03b1\u2212helix. To determine its affinity to micasin, we titrated a fluorescently labeled RBD with different concentrations of chemically synthesized micasin to record the change of MST traces. The result showed that micasin bound to RBD at a low micromolar concentration with a K D of 5.04 \u00b1 0.96 \u00b5M (n = 3) ( Figure 3C ), thus experimentally supporting our computational prediction and indicating that micasin is a novel binder of RBD.

Using a modified renaturation method [32] , we obtained soluble RBD protein from the E. coli inclusion bodies ( Figure S1 ). The product was further purified by size\u2212exclusion chromatography (SEC) ( Figure 3A ) and the collected peak showed a single component of 21,818.65 Da determined by HPLC\u2212Q\u2212TOF\u2212MS ( Figure 3A , inset), precisely matching the theoretical MW of RBD (21,817.49 Da) calculated from the sequence with eight hydrogens removed due to the presence of four disulfide bridges. Analytical RP\u2212HPLC showed that the recombinant RBD adopted a homogeneous conformation ( Figure 3B , inset) with a native\u2212like mixed \u03b1\u2212helix and \u03b2\u2212sheet structure, as identified by its CD spectra ( Figure 3B ) where a positive maximum at 197 nm signifies \u03b2\u2212sheet and a negative minimum around 208 nm signifies \u03b1\u2212helix. To determine its affinity to micasin, we titrated a fluorescently labeled RBD with different concentrations of chemically synthesized micasin to record the change of MST traces. The result showed that micasin bound to RBD at a low micromolar concentration with a KD of 5.04 \u00b1 0.96 \u03bcM (n = 3) ( Figure 3C ), thus experimentally supporting our computational prediction and indicating that micasin is a novel binder of RBD.

As may be expected, this mutant exhibited a six\u2212fold higher binding affinity to RBD with a KD of 0.72 \u00b1 0.22 \u03bcM (n = 3) determined by MST ( Figure 6C ).

However, the introduction of a bulky side\u2212chain tryptophan at this site disrupted the binding, as revealed by our MST experiments ( Figure S3 ), which is most likely due to steric hindrance. Taken together, our data suggest that a cationic residue with a suitable side\u2212chain size at position 8 is key to the improvement of the affinity of micasin.

However, the introduction of a bulky side\u2212chain tryptophan at this site disrupted the binding, as revealed by our MST experiments ( Figure S3 ), which is most likely due to steric hindrance. Taken together, our data suggest that a cationic residue with a suitable side\u2212chain size at position 8 is key to the improvement of the affinity of micasin. ",

It is worth mentioning that a moderate binding affinity cannot guarantee that these peptides immediately become a therapeutic agent because they could not compete with human natural ACE2 that has a higher affinity to RBD [29] . To improve their affinity, some current protein engineering technologies may be useful, which include experimental and computational deep mutational scanning, structure\u2212based mutations, ancestral sequence reconstruction and the consensus concept [40] [41] [42] [43] [44] [45] . In addition, since ACE2 exhibits a higher affinity to RBD when it exists as a dimer, we speculate that the affinity of these defensins would also be improved by linking them to some dimerization scaffolds, such as the immunoglobulin Fc fragments, the ACE2 neck domain, or even some smaller dimerization peptides (e.g., leucine zipper or HLXc) [40, 46] . Given the recent emergence of nanomedicine [47, 48] , multivalent binding of multiple engineered defensins to the surfaces of nanoparticles may be an attractive approach in exploring these peptides into clinical application. In this work, we found that compared with the full\u2212length micasin, the truncated (BH)\u22121 had a slightly higher affinity to the RBD in the absence of the interacting residue\u2212rich HAR region ( Figure 1A ). This is, perhaps, not unexpected since a similar case is also observed in other defensins against bacteria [33, 34] . In these cases, the smaller peptides might adopt a different mode of action to bind their targets in a more efficient manner.",

As proof, it works as an inflammation inducer via Toll-like receptor 2\u2212dependent activation of the NF\u2212kB pathway to induce a series of inflammatory factors such as cytokines and chemokines [49] . Its subunit 1 (S1) was found to induce COVID\u221219\u2212like acute lung injury in transgenic mice and barrier dysfunction in human cells [50] . S1 exhibited a non\u2212receptor\u2212mediated lipid membrane permeabilization and consequently caused the toxicity on human lung cells [51] . Because the membrane\u2212disruptive activity in many cases lacks a cellular specificity, it is likely that such permeabilization would also occur in erythrocytes. If it is true, this finding might well explain the recently observed physical phenotype alterations in blood cells of COVID\u221219 patients [52] . Therefore, further screening and engineering of fungus\u2212derived high\u2212affinity binders to block the Spike protein could be of value in exploiting drugs to relieve the Spike protein\u2212evoked symptoms of COVID\u221219.",
