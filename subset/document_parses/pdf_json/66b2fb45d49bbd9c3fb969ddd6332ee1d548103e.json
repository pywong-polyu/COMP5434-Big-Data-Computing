However, few studies have investigated the circulation of clade 2.3.4.4c viruses after 2015. Here, we describe Gs/GD clade 2.3.4.4c and Mexican-like H5N2 viruses that were isolated in Taiwan during active surveillance conducted in chicken farms from February to March 2019. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated two distinct genome constellations of the clade 2.3.4.4c H5 viruses, with the internal genes of one of the new genotypes closely related to a virus isolated from a pintail (Anas acuta) in Taiwan, providing the first direct evidence that migratory birds play a role in importing viruses into Taiwan. Our study also confirmed the co-circulation of Gs/GD clade 2.3.4.4c and Mexican-like H5 lineage viruses in Taiwan, presenting a rare case where Gs/GD viruses developed sustained transmission alongside another enzootic H5 lineage, raising the possibility that homosubtypic immunity may mask virus transmission, potentially frustrating detection, and the implementation of appropriate control measures. To eradicate H5 viruses from poultry in Taiwan, further studies on the effect of co-circulation in poultry of low pathogenic avian influenza and HPAI viruses are needed. Furthermore, only with continued surveillance efforts globally can we fully discern dispersal patterns and risk factors of virus transmission both to and within Taiwan.",

Since 2008, clade 2.3.4.4 H5 viruses have acquired different neuraminidase (NA) genes from LPAI viruses leading to the emergence of subtypes other than H5N1 including H5N2, H5N6, and H5N8 (Saito et al. 2015; Smith et al. 2015) . Clade 2.3.4.4c H5N8 viruses, one of the sub-lineages of clade 2.3.4.4 (WHO 2020), caused severe outbreaks in Korean poultry farms in early 2014 (Lee et al. 2014b; Saito et al. 2015) . Before the end of 2014, viruses from the same lineage had spread to Japan, Europe, and unprecedentedly, to Canada, and the USA (Bouwstra et al. 2015; Ip et al. 2015; Kanehira et al. 2015) . In North America, these H5 viruses that were likely dispersed between continents by migratory birds, soon reassorted with enzootic LPAI viruses and caused outbreaks in poultry farms (Ip et al. 2015; Saito et al. 2015) .",

By the end of 2015, HPAI viruses were found in 944 farms with 4.15 million birds culled in response to the epidemics (BAPHIQ 2019). As in North America, this is the first time that Gs/GD-like H5 viruses have caused sustained transmission in Taiwan ( Supplementary Fig. S1 ). Multiple subtypes, including H5N2, H5N3, and H5N8 viruses, were generated through reassortment (Supplementary Table S1 ), among which at least five genetic constellations were identified . Viruses belonging to a Mexican-like H5N2 lineage, which has been circulating in Taiwan since 2003 (Lee et al. 2014a; Li et al. 2017) , were also isolated during the 2015 epidemics . Interestingly, some of these Mexican-like viruses isolated during 2008-14 had more than two basic amino acids at the HA cleavage site, a well-studied virulence marker of avian influenza, and were characterized as potential HPAI (Soda et al. 2011; Lee et al. 2014a; Li et al. 2017 ). All viruses isolated in 2015, however, had only two basic amino acids and are characterized as LPAI (Li et al. 2017) .",

In addition, H5N2 and H5N8 HPAI viruses were continuously detected during 2015-18 based on the government-run surveillance (Supplementary  Table S1 ). However, during the same period there were few studies focusing on clade 2.3.4.4c viruses circulating in Taiwan. Although clades 2.3.4.4b and 2.3.4.4e H5N6 viruses were detected and described in 2017 (Chen et al. 2018; Liu et al. 2018) , there is no evidence that these viruses developed sustained transmission in poultry in Taiwan (WHO 2020) ( Supplementary   Fig. S1 and Table S1 ). In this study, we aim to understand the current situation of H5 epidemics in Taiwan. By analyzing newly sequenced H5N2 viruses from chicken farms, we confirmed that both clade 2.3.4.4c and Mexican-like H5N2 continued to circulate in 2019. A virus isolated from a pintail (Anas acuta) further demonstrated that migratory birds were able to import genes from the wild bird influenza gene pool, potentially contributing to the H5 reassortants described here.",

At least twenty cloacal or fresh dropping swabs were sampled from a total of fortysix poultry farms during January and March 2019. There were on average about 18,000 birds in each farm while the survey was conducted. Two chicken farms with avian influenza virus detected in this study were also diagnosed by the governmentrun surveillance system, and the farms were then subjected to regular control measures including culling all the birds (Lee et al. 2016; Liu et al. 2018) . Migratory waterfowls were trapped using funnel trap (Whitworth et al. 2007) in Aogu Wetland Forest Park, Chiayi County, Taiwan, a major wintering site for migratory birds on the west coast. Waterfowls trapped in this study were species migrating through the East Asian-Australasian Flyway from Alaska or Siberia in the winter. Oral and cloacal swabs were collected from trapped waterfowls. A total eighty-nine samples composed of nine species, including pintail, Eurasian wigeon, and garganey, were collected from November 2017 to February 2018. The procedures for wild waterfowls trapping and sample collection were approved by Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of National Pingtung University of Science and Technology (Approval number: NPUST-106-029).",

Sequences shorter than 0.95\u00c2 the lengths of coding region or sequences containing more than 1 per cent ambiguous nucleotides were discarded. Curated sequences were then aligned using MAFFT v7.407 and trimmed to coding regions. Before selecting representative strains, all available sequences of eight segments were separately pooled with sequences generated in our study, and the alignments were subject to maximum likelihood (ML) tree inference using IQ-TREE v1.6.12 (Nguyen et al. 2015 ) with a general time reversible (GTR) substitution model plus a Gamma-distributed rate. Previous Taiwanese isolates, samples collected in this study and their closely related strains were further selected to generate ML trees inferred by RAxML v8.2.12 (Stamatakis 2014) , with a GTR plus gamma substitution model and 1,000 bootstrap iterations. Accession numbers of the sequences analyzed in this study have been provided in Supplementary Table S2. A Bayesian phylogenetic framework was implemented to explore additional evolutionary and epidemiological information with HA sequences of clade 2.3.4.4c and Mexican-like lineage viruses. TempEst v1.5.3 was used to examine temporal signals in each dataset (Rambaut et al. 2016) , taking an ML tree reconstructed by RAxML and times of virus isolation as input. Timescaled phylogeny was then inferred using BEAST v.1.10.4 (Suchard et al. 2018 ). We employed a GTR plus gamma substitution model, and an uncorrelated lognormal relaxed molecular clock (Drummond et al. 2006 ) with a Skygrid demographic prior for each dataset (Gill et al. 2013) . Ancestral geographical locations were inferred along the phylogeny by implementing a discrete-state continuous time Markov chain model in BEAST for clade 2.3.4.4c dataset. We employed an asymmetric substitution model with Bayesian stochastic search variable selection for transition parameters (Lemey et al. 2009 ). Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis was run for 120 million steps and sampled every 10,000 steps. For each dataset, two parallel runs were conducted and combined with a burnin of 20 million per chain using LogCombiner (Suchard et al. 2018) . Parameters logged during the MCMC runs were inspected by Tracer v1.7.1 (Rambaut et al. 2018) . Summarized maximum clade credibility (MCC) trees were inferred using TreeAnnotator (Suchard et al. 2018 ) and subsequently visualized with R package ggtree (Yu et al. 2018 ).",

Preliminary phylogenetic analysis indicated that viruses from chicken farms were all H5N2 viruses; five of them were clade 2.3.4.4c viruses and one belonged to the Mexican-like H5 lineage ( Supplementary Fig. S1 ).

Basic amino acids at the HA cleavage site of 2019 viruses (PLRERRRKR/GLF) were also identical to previous clade 2.3.4.4c viruses from Taiwan (Lee et al. 2016) . However, by analyzing phylogenetic relationships of all eight genes, we found two novel genotypes each represented by viruses in one farm. We thus assigned Genotypes 7 and 8 to these new isolates (Fig. 1B) , following a previous classification . For Genotype 7, their NP and NS genes were similar to the Gs/GD H5N2 virus found in 2016, which belong to Genotype 2 (Figs 1B and 2B and Supplementary Fig. S3 ).

In comparison, all of the viruses in Group A and some viruses in Group B during 2008-14 possessed three or more basic amino acid residues at the cleavage site. Furthermore, A/chicken/Taiwan/A1/2019 had a unique glycine residue at position \u00c03 (Fig. 3) . We confirmed this residue by another library containing at least 4,000\u00c2 coverage at this codon ( Supplementary Fig. S6 Supplementary Fig. S5) , and the regression line of genetic distance to time of the Mexican-like H5N2 viruses in Taiwan is also similar to that of viruses isolated in the Americas from 1994 to 2009. Taken together, these results suggest the enzootic circulation of Mexican-like H5N2 viruses in Taiwan. Phylogenetic analyses show this H5N2 virus possessed a classical Mexican-like H5N2 genotype as its HA and NA were most similar to H5N2 viruses isolated from Taiwan in 2015, whereas internal genes clustered with enzootic H6N1 viruses (Figs 2 and 3 and Supplementary Fig. S3 ).",

Although we were unable to directly examine its pathogenicity in chickens, closely related H5N2 viruses isolated in 2015 also with two basic amino acids were all low pathogenic (Li et al. 2017) . Li et al. (2017) proposed that current control measures, which mandates culling in farms diagnosed with viruses having HPAI but not farms diagnosed with LPAI viruses, allowed Mexican-like H5N2 viruses to persist in poultry populations. Corroborating this hypothesis, our results show that the 2019 H5N2 strain originated from a subgroup that has maintained low pathogenic markers since 2012. As far as we are aware, the acquisition and then loss of basic amino acids, and the associated phenotype, in these viruses has not been previously recorded. Other hypotheses, for example, competitive exclusion with Gs/GD-like viruses leading to the replacement of HPAI Mexican-like H5N2 viruses cannot be discounted.",

We found evidence for the first time that viruses of these two lineages could cocirculate within a single farm. Although only a single Mexicanlike virus was detected, repeated sequencing ascertained that the sequence was not a contaminant (Supplementary Data). Cocirculation of these two lineages in poultry farms may further complicate disease control efforts for two reasons. First, preexposure to one of the virus strains may confer homosubtypic immunity against other H5 stains, resulting in milder symptoms or lower mortality thereby masking virus transmission. Second, even though sick birds are detected, the farm may be exempted from further control measures if solely LPAI sequences are detected. Further studies on how pre-exposure to LPAI Mexican-like viruses may mediate pathogenicity of Gs/GD HPAI virus in poultry are needed.",

Other analyses, including the timing introduction of clade 2.3.4.4 viruses and their genome constellations are not affected by sample size. Therefore, our data should be interpreted as the 'lower bound' estimates of genetic diversity in the area. In fact, a new subtype of clade 2.3.4.4c, H5N5, along with clade H5N2 outbreaks were reported during the time of our investigation (OIE 2019). In this regard, we urge for comprehensive surveillance of poultry farms in Taiwan to identify sources and patterns of local transmission in the island to inform control efforts and halt current enzootic transmission.",
