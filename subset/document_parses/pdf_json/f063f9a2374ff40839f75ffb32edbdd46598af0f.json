England has a suite of clinical and administrative datasets that routinely collect detailed health information and outcomes for the population. We used such multi-sourced and linked electronic heath records from the National Heart Failure Audit (NHFA), Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) and the Civil Registration of Death Data of the Office for National Statistics (ONS) to quantify the extent and impact of changes in admissions for heart failure and understand whether in-hospital management of patients and their post discharge outcomes has been affected as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.",

During the COVID-19 pandemic, emergency guidance enabled any doctor in the UK (not just the attending) to complete the medical certificate of cause of death, the duration of time over which the deceased was not seen before referral to the coroner was extended from 14 to 28 days and causes of death could be 'to the best of their knowledge and belief' without diagnostic proof, if appropriate and to avoid delay. ICD-10 codes, corresponding to the principal and contributory causes of death on the MCCD, were used to identify deaths from heart failure. Individual patient data from the NHFA were linked using each patient's unique NHS identification number to the ONS dataset to track mortality for 30 days from hospital discharge; this also allowed mortality within 30-days of admission to be calculated. We also collected ONS data for all adult deaths in England. We reported daily deaths for heart failure recorded in the primary position and in any position.",

Despite the restructuring of hospital services and diversion of resources to COVID-19 care, adjusted in-hospital mortality related to heart failure and provision of guideline-directed heart failure medications and investigations were similar in the COVID-19 and pre-COVID-19 periods in NHFA.

This is the first national analysis to assess the direct and indirect impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on hospitalization rates and mortality for patients 13 with heart failure in the hospital and community. We found a dramatic decline in heart failure hospitalizations during the COVID-19 pandemic. This reduction probably reflects successful attempts at hospital avoidance by patients to minimise the risk of hospital-acquired COVID-19 and, perhaps, increased support in the community. Patients with heart failure may have remained at home due to fears of exposure to COVID-19, breaking their shielding or social quarantine, leading to an increase in heart failure deaths in the community. Furthermore, some NHS trusts introduced new rapid access cardiology clinics and use of acute care services at home to reduced hospitalizations during COVID-19 pandemic but its impact on overall NHS service is relatively unknown. [10] [11] [12] . In addition, hospital services were reconfigured to create additional beds for COVID-19 patients by repurposing cardiology wards, cancelling outpatient clinics (or replacing them with remote clinics) and postponing elective procedural activities.",

The rates of investigations, including echocardiography, were similar in the COVID-19 and pre-COVID-19 periods. Plasma concentrations of BNP/NT-proBNP were somewhat higher in the COVID-19 period, suggesting a higher threshold for admission and sicker patients. Simultaneously, it appears that these \"sicker\" patients received on average less aggressive diuresis (less median weight loss during hospitalization) during the hospitalization and had shorter length of stay. Interestingly we observed an increased odds of 30-day mortality during the COVID period that may be explained by our observation that sicker patients were less aggressively diuresed and had shorter lengths of stay. patients may have been discharged prematurely to create more hospital beds or with arrangements to receive palliation for some end stage heart failure patients in community. Gaps in post-discharge care due to closure of ambulatory care centres during the COVID-19 pandemic may have contributed to suboptimal care and increased risk of death following hospitalization. These are the possible main factors for observing higher natriuretic peptides values, shorter stay in the hospital and lesser weight loss during COVID-19 period compared to Pre-COVID-19 period. Meanwhile, deaths attributed to heart failure in the community and care homes also increased during the COVID-19 pandemic.",

Similar to any observational study there are limitations. While we had information about the proportion of patients with HFrEF, we could not differentiate between patients who had heart failure with mid-range ejection fraction (HFmrEF) and HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). Some general aspects of health such as frailty, mood, social network and cognitive functions were not recorded. More detailed assessments of cardiac function, especially with echocardiography or other imaging modalities were not available. During the earlier phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, widespread COVID-19 testing was not available in England for everyone and was limited to targeted and high-risk patients. It's not possible to ascertain from current study how many HF patients actually had COVID-19 infection during hospital admission. It's also possible that some patients were admitted due to COVID-19 infection and developed an acute exacerbation of HF that was not captured in the NHFA as the primary diagnosis for discharge or death was not HF. Other patients might have been admitted in hospital due to exacerbation of HF and became infected with COVID-19 during the hospital stay and ultimately died in the hospital or community. Finally, during the COVID-19 pandemic, emergency guidance enabled any doctor in the UK to complete the medical certificate of cause of death and causes of death could be 'to the best of their knowledge and belief'. This may have resulted in misclassification or bias towards certain causes of death.",
