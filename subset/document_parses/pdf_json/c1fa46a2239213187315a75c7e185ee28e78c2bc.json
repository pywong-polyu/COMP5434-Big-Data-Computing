Adults and children with suspected current SARS-CoV2 infection who are having an oropharyngeal/nasopharyngeal (OP/NP) swab for laboratory SARS-CoV2 reverse transcriptase Digital/Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (d/rRT-PCR) as part of clinical care or community-based testing will be invited to participate. Adults (\u2265 16 years) with suspected past symptomatic infection will also be recruited. Asymptomatic individuals will not be eligible. At the baseline visit, all participants will be asked to submit samples for at least one candidate point-of-care test (POCT) being evaluated (index test/s) as well as an OP/NP swab for laboratory SARS-CoV2 RT-PCR performed by Public Health England (PHE) (reference standard for current infection). Adults will also be asked for a blood sample for laboratory SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing by PHE (reference standard for past infection), where feasible adults will be invited to attend a second visit at 28 days for repeat antibody testing. Additional study data (e.g. demographics, symptoms, observations, household contacts) will be captured electronically. Sensitivity, specificity, positive, and negative predictive values for each POCT will be calculated with exact 95% confidence intervals when compared to the reference standard. POCTs will also be compared to composite reference standards constructed using paired antibody test results, patient reported outcomes, linked electronic health records for outcomes related to COVID-19 such as hospitalisation or death, and other test results.",

In contrast, poorly performing POCTs could have negative effects, so it is necessary to undertake community-based diagnostic accuracy evaluations before rolling these out.

Public health policy has focused on rapid identification and isolation ('test and trace' [3] ) of new cases with targeted local responses to control resurgence of new infections, including areas previously deemed to be virus free [4] . However, efforts have been limited by both shortfalls in laboratory infrastructure, skilled human resources and testing reagents [5] , delays in receiving results, and tracing subsequent contacts of positive cases [6] .

Additional public health impacts of rapid results include reducing residential transmission of infections and improving surveillance of health and social care staff. Whilst there has been accelerated development of POCTs for SARS-CoV-2, there is a lack of data on test safety, accuracy, and utility and performance [11] . Point-of-care antibody testing is wellestablished in other infections and is easily scalable [12] , but initial studies in SARS-CoV-2 have had disappointing results [13] . Novel molecular technologies remain unproven in this context [14] . Accordingly, experts in diagnostics ward against widespread use of POCTs for SARS-CoV-2 before in-context evaluation [11, 15] , and medical regulators require clear evidence of acceptable sensitivity and specificity prior to approval [16] .",

Most of the current data for analytical performance of new POCTs for SARS-CoV-2 is from small and selective patient samples tested within laboratories by highly trained staff [17] [18] [19] . Studies in clinical settings have focused on hospitalised patients who are more likely to have higher viral loads, and may undergo invasive procedures to increase yield of respiratory tract sampling [20] . Community settings are characteristically different, and extrapolating results from elsewhere risks spectrum bias and low confidence in results [21] . POCTs must work well when there is a lower prevalence and severity of disease, overlap in presentation with other common clinical syndromes, and in elderly and frail patients who may mount weaker immune responses [22] . Community staff performing POCTs have little-or-no laboratory experience and no ready access to technical support. False negatives are more damaging as ambulatory patients can potentially propel community transmission, whilst false positives in otherwise healthy individuals could hamper efforts to kickstart return to work and education [23] .",

It is important to identify high-performing tests to prioritise these for use, and to avoid poorly performing technologies. We have set out in this protocol how we will achieve this in UK community settings. The RAPTOR-C19 diagnostic platform has been developed to support the UK's Urgent Public Health response to COVID-19. Building RAPTOR-C19 on top of an established surveillance network (RCGP RSC) gives efficiencies, gives advantages for digital data collection, and aids recruitment.",

The UK had surpassed a peak of SARS-CoV-2 infections at the time this protocol was being prepared for publication, with national easing of lockdown underway. COVID-19 testing capacity in the NHS took time to develop, with initial testing mainly occurring in the hospital setting, later through local COVID-19 'hubs' and then national testing centres. At the height of the first peak, the prevalence of infection was > 30% in those tested [38] . As testing increased outside of the hospital setting, the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infections fell, due to a combination of decreasing national SARS-CoV-2 infection prevalence and increased testing in a broader population [39] . Whilst we welcome this reduction in prevalence, it results in larger sample sizes for clinical research.",

To maximise recruitment RAPTOR-C19 will recruit from a base of high-throughput practices, with large practice populations, and/or practices acting as COVID-19 hubs, with wide geographical spread throughout the UK, including urban centres with high population density. Additional practices will be asked to act as stand-by sites where evaluation may begin rapidly in response to local outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2. This combined approach is intended to increase the likelihood of capturing positive cases in symptomatic people above the background national prevalence of SARS-CoV-2. From a public health point of view, correctly ruling-in active SARS-CoV-2 is just as important as ruling it out. Therefore, we need POCTs that are both highly sensitive and highly specific. The CONDOR triage process aims to identify POCTs that align with the MHRA specification based on the available data from the manufacturer or independent analytical analyses. By starting with a rigorous selection process, we reduce the probability of evaluating poorly performing POCTs.",

A corresponding weakness is that a test which has focussed on achieving high sensitivity but has low specificity may be disadvantaged in a low prevalence setting, especially if the anticipated prevalence used to set the stopping criteria, was higher than the actual prevalence. In this circumstance, tests may be excluded from the analysis because of accumulating too many false positive results in comparison to the laboratory and composite reference standards. Nevertheless, these stopping criteria reflect MHRA mandated performance criteria. During early evaluations we will establish whether sufficient information to create the composite reference standard can be obtained sufficiently quickly to make stopping criteria viable.",

GP sites will be recruited from the RCGP Research and Surveillance Centre (RSC) is an internationally renowned source of information, analysis, and interpretation of primary care data [40] . The dataset is nationally representative [41] , having only small differences with the national population, which have now been quantified and can be assessed for clinical relevance for specific studies. With twice weekly data extractions, the dataset is one of the most up to date in the UK, and now a platform within ORCHID. ORCHID is in the process of enhancing the frequency of extraction and scope of data linkage. It is already extracting primary care computerised medical records (CMRs) daily and linking with linked hospital data and mortality data. ORCHID will additionally support RAPTOR-C19 by allowing patient follow-up within the RCGP RSC network, and the creation of an enhanced composite reference standard to overcome limitations of laboratory reference tests [30] . However, in the pandemic situation, community testing has been expanded in unexpected and unprecedented ways. In order to respond to the needs of the community and maximise recruitment and coverage of different clinical settings, we may also recruit from other community settings where reference RT-PCR swabs are being or can be collected. These might include national testing centres, home testing systems, surveillance and national telephone triage services, pop-up community laboratories in areas of increasing local prevalence, transport infrastructure and the UK borders, and educational or commercial organisations. People tested at these locations will not necessarily be registered at RCGP RSC practices, and the venues may not be able to undertake venepuncture, so it may not be possible to use the same reference standards as at GP practices. Many of these settings undertake service evaluations that align with government priorities, and we would seek to partner with these organisations. We would aim to establish data sharing agreements for a limited set of de-identified participant and test result data to permit the primary evaluation of POCTs used in these settings against the usual RT-PCR reference standard, and depending on the data they are able to collect, modified enhanced standards.",
