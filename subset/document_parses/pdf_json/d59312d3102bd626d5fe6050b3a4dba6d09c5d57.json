[3] [4] [5] Although thrombocytopenia has been associated with increased mortality in ARDS, 6 and particularly in patients infected with H1N1 influenza, 7 analysis of quantitative changes in platelet activation levels in ARDS and of how these may differ between the various etiologies of ARDS is limited. 3 Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is clinically associated with a high incidence of thrombosis [8] [9] [10] and with a high burden of pulmonary and systemic platelet-rich microthrombi. 11, 12 Interestingly, in contrast to a cohort of patients with H1N1-influenza infection with ARDS of equal severity, patients with COVID-19 ARDS displayed a 9 times higher burden of alveolar capillary platelet-rich microthrombi. 11 Patients with COVID-19 who were autopsied demonstrated an abundance of platelet-rich thrombi in the pulmonary and systemic microvasculature despite having received anticoagulation therapy. 12 Clinically, thromboelastography (TEG) studies have also demonstrated a hypercoagulable profile in patients with severe COVID-19 9,13 despite prophylactic anticoagulation. TEG profiles remained hypercoagulable, with parameters suggesting a significant hypercoagulable effect from platelet activity and fibrin. 13 Multiple study groups [14] [15] [16] including ours 17 have reported dramatically increased platelet activation, platelet reactivity, and platelet-leukocyte aggregates in COVID-19 compared with those in healthy blood donors (controls). In one study, 15 patients with severe COVID-19 harbored a higher degree of platelet activation and platelet-monocyte aggregation compared with patients with COVID-19 that was not severe. In addition, plasma from patients with severe COVID-19 increased the ex vivo activation of platelets and monocytes from healthy controls, a phenomenon inhibited by abciximab, a platelet aggregation inhibitor. Platelet activation correlated with COVID-19 severity in that study. 15 A second study demonstrated an 89-fold increase in platelet hyperreactivity with low-dose stimulation by thromboxane A 2 (TXA 2 ) receptor agonist compared with that in controls. 16 A third study 14 demonstrated increases in platelet activation, platelet reactivity, and platelet-leukocyte aggregates in patients with COVID-19 compared with healthy controls. These studies demonstrate that platelet reactivity is enhanced in patients with COVID-19 and posit that platelet hyperreactivity may be a primary driver of thrombosis in patients with severe COVID-19, contributing to organ failure and death. Whether this degree of platelet hyperreactivity is unique to COVID-19 or is also encountered during ARDS not related to COVID-19 was addressed in our study.",

Patients who were receiving medications that interfere with platelet function within 2 weeks before the experiment started were excluded from the study. COVID-19 diagnosis was confirmed at the time of admission by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction analysis of samples from the nasopharyngeal swabs, and patients were subsequently divided into nonsevere and severe COVID-19 groups on the basis of clinical criteria using the American Thoracic Society guidelines for community-acquired pneumonia. 18 Patients with nonsevere COVID-19 were not included in this study. Etiologies of ARDS unrelated to COVID-19 were diverse and included pneumococcal pneumonia (n 5 1), carbon monoxide poisoning (n 5 1), post-cardiac surgery (n 5 2), rhinovirus infection (n 5 1), and cerebrovascular accident (n 5 3). ARDS was defined according to Berlin criteria. 19 Sex-and agematched healthy blood donors were used as controls. When platelet samples were acquired, all patients with ARDS had an arterial oxygen partial pressure:fractional inspired oxygen (PaO 2 : FiO 2 ) ratio #150 mmHg and were given pressure-controlled ventilation with tidal volumes of ;6 to 8 mL/kg ideal body weight. Patients with COVID-19 ARDS were maintained on a positive endexpiratory pressure of 8 to 14 cm H 2 O. Only 1 patient had renal failure (ARDS with carbon monoxide poisoning), and none required renal replacement therapy at the time of sample acquisition.

These differences were abolished at a higher concentration of a-thrombin (2 U/mL). Furthermore, the time required to achieve 50% aggregation (T 50 ) was significantly reduced for platelets obtained from patients with COVID-19 ARDS admission were also analyzed for thromboxane B 2 (TXB 2 , a stable metabolite of TXA 2 ), platelet factor 4 (PF4), soluble CD40 ligand (sCD40L), and serotonin as surrogate markers of in vivo platelet activation. Results ( Figure 1C -F) indicate that plasma from patients with ARDS unrelated to COVID-19 have increased levels of TXB 2 and PF4 and have equivalent levels of sCD40L and serotonin relative to levels in healthy controls. In contrast, patients with COVID-19 (who did or did not have ARDS) demonstrated significantly increased levels of all 4 mediators relative to those in healthy controls as well as to those in patients with ARDS without COVID-19. These results suggest that during COVID-19, platelets release more soluble mediators and are hyperresponsive to a-thrombin relative to platelets from patients with ARDS without COVID-19 and from healthy controls.",

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report that suggests a heightened platelet reactivity in COVID-19 patients compared with patients with ARDS unrelated to COVID-19. This difference in platelet hyperreactivity may be of clinical and therapeutic significance, given the high incidence of pulmonary and systemic vascular thrombosis in patients with severe COVID-19 8, 9 who are frequently resistant to anticoagulation with heparin. 9 This unusually resistant hypercoagulable state associated with a high incidence of thrombosis is likely mediated by platelet hyperreactivity, a phenomenon observed in other etiologies of ARDS but, as demonstrated in this study, occurring with a uniquely high intensity during COVID-19. Mirroring our findings in COVID-19, the existing evidence that links H1N1 influenza ARDS to increased platelet hyperreactivity, 20 increased levels of platelet-derived chemokines, 21 and a higher incidence of clinical thrombosis 22 suggests that quantifying platelet hyperreactivity in COVID-19 in clinical practice may be of prognostic and therapeutic 23 value.",
