Many persons with dementia reside in LTC facilities, and they are often unable to understand why isolation during the pandemic is needed. 4 Isolation from loved ones for those with dementia can worsen cognition and depression. 5 The purpose of this case report is to highlight isolation practices implemented in an LTC facility to reduce the spread of COVID-19, the ramifications of the consequent social isolation, including worsening cognition and depression in a resident with dementia and depression, and some possible evidence-based solutions that could be implemented by advanced practice nurses (APNs).",
