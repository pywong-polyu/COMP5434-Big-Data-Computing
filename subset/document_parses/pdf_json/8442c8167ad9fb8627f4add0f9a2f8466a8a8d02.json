It included 214 adult inpatients with a laboratory-confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction assay (RT-PCR) for SARS-CoV-2 on nasopharyngeal swab and had a transthoracic echocardiogram performed during the index hospitalization. Primary outcome was 30-day all-cause inpatient mortality. Secondary outcomes were 30-day utilization of mechanical ventilator support, vasopressors, or renal replacement therapy. Results: Mild right ventricular systolic dysfunction (odds ratio (OR): 3.51, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.63-7.57, p \u00bc 0.001), moderate to severe right ventricular systolic dysfunction (OR: 7.30, 95% CI: 2.20-24.25, p \u00bc 0.001), pulmonary hypertension (OR: 5.39, 95% CI: 1.96-14.86, p \u00bc 0.001), and moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation (OR: 3.92, 95% CI: 1.71-9.03, p \u00bc 0.001) were each associated with increased odds of 30-day all-cause inpatient mortality. Pulmonary hypertension and moderate to severe right ventricular dysfunction were each associated with increased odds of 30-day utilization of mechanical ventilator support and vasopressors. Conclusions: Right ventricular dysfunction, pulmonary hypertension, and moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation were associated with increased odds for 30-day inpatient mortality. This study highlights the importance of echocardiography and its clinical utility and prognostic value for evaluating hospitalized COVID-19 patients.",

            "text": "The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was first identified in December 2019 involving a cluster of pneumonia in the province of Wuhan, China. 1 New York City was disproportionately affected by Coronavirus Disease 2019 and became the epicenter for the pandemic in the United States of America. Within New York City, there were greater than 230,000 cases and 19,000 confirmed deaths following a positive COVID-19 laboratory test. 2 Cardiac manifestations from COVID-19 include acute cardiac injury, arrhythmias, acute coronary syndromes, pericarditis, and myocarditis, and they are clinically relevant as they result in increased mortality. 3, 4 Other risk factors for mortality include older age, male sex, and medical history of hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and chronic kidney disease, which are all associated with increased mortality risk from COVID-19. Moreover, elevated cardiac troponin, C-reactive protein, and elevated D-dimer are associated with reduced survival. 5 Reports on cardiac imaging of COVID-19 patients are emerging. One study showed that abnormal right ventricular longitudinal strain (RVLS) was an independent predictor of higher mortality in 120 COVID-19 patients. 6 A study of 110 COVID-19 patients found that right ventricular (RV) enlargement was present in 31%, and this was associated with increased mortality. 7 Another study involving hospitalized non-intensive care unit (non-ICU) patients showed that pulmonary hypertension was associated with a higher rate of in-hospital mortality. 8 As cardiac manifestations result in increased mortality in COVID-19, echocardiography may assist in the early implementation of therapeutic interventions based on imaging findings. Our primary aim is to identify echocardiographic variables that are associated with 30-day all-cause mortality in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Our secondary aims are to identify echocardiographic parameters associated with mechanical ventilation use, vasopressors, and renal replacement therapy in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Identification of these echocardiographic findings may augment the evaluation and management of COVID-19 patients.",

Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) greater than or equal to 51% was considered normal, LVEF 41%-50% mildly reduced, LVEF 30%-40% moderately reduced, and LVEF less than 30% was categorized as severely reduced. Left ventricular enddiastolic dimension was measured in the parasternal longaxis views obtained perpendicular to the long axis at the level of the mitral valve leaflet tips. 9 RV size was measured in the apical 4 chamber or RV focused view and considered enlarged if in end-diastole the basal or mid-level diameter exceeded 41 mm or 35 mm, respectively. RV systolic function was assessed qualitatively on 2D images with incorporated visual recognition and qualitative measures and graded as normal, mildly reduced, or moderate to severely reduced based on free wall inward movement, shortening of the RV in the long axis secondary to contraction of the longitudinal fibers, and RV free wall traction. 6 RV systolic excursion velocity (S 0 ) was measured at the lateral annulus of the tricuspid valve by pulsed wave tissue Doppler interrogation. 10 Pulmonary arterial systolic pressure (PASP) was determined by assessing peak tricuspid regurgitation (TR) velocity with continuous wave Doppler and right atrial pressure (RAP) based on inferior vena cava (IVC) size. PASP was calculated by using the simplified Bernoulli's equation [4 (TR) 2 \u00fe RAP]. In non-mechanically ventilated patients, RAP was assumed to be 3 mmHg with IVC size less than 2.1 cm and respiratory variation greater than 50%, 15 mmHg if IVC was greater than 2.1 cm with respiratory variation less than 50%, and otherwise considered 8 mmHg if it did not meet either criteria. The presence of pulmonary hypertension was defined by a PASP greater than 35 mmHg. In the setting of an incomplete TR jet velocity or indeterminate RAP, a TR velocity greater than 2.8 m/s was also considered to be positive for the presence of pulmonary hypertension.",

            "text": "We found RV systolic dysfunction regardless of severity had increased odds for 30-day all-cause mortality. In addition, the risk was proportional to the degree of RV dysfunction with moderate to severe RV systolic dysfunction resulting in higher odds than mild RV dysfunction. For secondary outcomes, any degree of RV systolic dysfunction was associated with increased odds for utilization of vasopressors and renal replacement therapy. Pulmonary hypertension was also associated with adverse 30-day clinical outcomes of increased odds for all-cause inpatient mortality, need for mechanical ventilation, and vasopressor utilization. Moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation was associated with increased odds for 30-day all-cause mortality and renal replacement therapy (see Fig. 1 ). Acute right heart failure or systolic dysfunction can occur due to increased RV afterload or decreased RV contractility. 13 COVID-19 is often associated with chest CT scans findings of bilateral multilobar ground-glass opacifications 14 and associated hypoxic respiratory failure, which can increase RV afterload. In addition, COVID-19 may predispose patients to having venous thrombotic events, including pulmonary embolism, which may further increase RV afterload. 15 RV dysfunction compromises cardiac output, and the shifting of the interventricular septum towards the left can compromise LV diastolic filling and reduce systemic output. 16 This reduced cardiac output may help explain the increased odds for vasopressors. This may also contribute to renal hypoperfusion. In addition, as RV dysfunction progresses, there is usually a rise in central venous pressure and subsequent rise in renal venous pressure which may reduce GFR. 17 This may explain why we found that any degree of RV systolic dysfunction was associated with an increased odds for both vasopressor support and renal replacement therapy. Additionally, approximately one-third of our cohort had RV enlargement. We found that RV enlargement was independently associated with renal replacement therapy. A previous study of 110 COVID-19 patients with RV enlargement reported an association with increased mortality. 7 We did not show an association between RV enlargement and mortality with our larger sample size. This suggests that further studies are needed before one can conclude that RV enlargement is associated with increased mortality. There is concern that patients with COVID-19 develop ARDS. 18 RV systolic dysfunction is independently shown to be associated with worse outcomes in patients with ARDS. 19 In our cohort, moderate to severe RV systolic dysfunction was associated with increased odds for mechanical ventilator support. In ARDS, the key reasons for RV dysfunction include elevated pulmonary vascular resistance secondary to imbalance between vasodilators and vasoconstrictors, hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction, endothelial injury, thrombosis, and possibly contractile impairment. 20 There may be a role of inflammation as well in the development of RV dysfunction with IL-6 being associated with RV dysfunction. 21 Higher IL-6 is associated with RV dysfunction independent of pulmonary vascular disease burden in pulmonary arterial hypertension. Thus, the inflammatory storm caused by COVID-19 may also contribute to RV dysfunction. 22 Pulmonary hypertension was also associated with adverse 30-day clinical outcomes of increased odds for allcause inpatient mortality, vasopressor utilization, and need for mechanical ventilator support. However, one of the limitations of PASP assessment on echocardiography is that non-physiologic TR jets (<0.8 m/s) and incomplete Doppler envelopes due to a lack of significant TR were excluded from the initial analysis unless the TR velocity was greater than 2.8 m/s. In addition, patients with unknown RAP in the setting of being mechanically ventilated were excluded in our primary analysis unless the TR velocity was greater than 2.8 m/s. We then performed an additional analysis by imputing that all patients who had an incomplete TR Doppler envelope or unknown RAP in the setting of TR velocity <2.8 m/s as having an absence of pulmonary hypertension. Our findings remained consistent with the original analysis as pulmonary hypertension continued to be associated with an increased odds for the adverse 30-day clinical outcomes.",

While RV S' is often used as a surrogate marker for RV systolic function, it is a reflection of contractility of the RV basal lateral segment 10 and mostly reflects longitudinal myocardial contraction. It does not take into consideration radial and circumferential fiber shortening. As a result, it may not correlate with RV dysfunction involving the mid to apical or septal RV segments. Furthermore, RV dysfunction in the setting of pulmonary embolism often does not involve the basal segment. 8 RV longitudinal strain from 2D speckletracking echocardiography is likely a more accurate estimate of RV systolic function. Abnormal RVLS has been shown to be an independent predictor of higher mortality in COVID-19 patients. 6 Also, in a smaller cohort of 115 patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, elevated mean pulmonary arterial pressure and RV dysfunction were each associated with higher risk for in-hospital mortality. 26 This finding for COVID-19 pneumonia is similar to our finding for COVID-19 patients of RV dysfunction associated with increased odds for mortality.

            "text": "There are several limitations. First, due to the COVID-19 pandemic and to ensure sonographer safety, our echocardiography laboratory had a modified, focused transthoracic echocardiogram protocol. For example, quantitative valvular stenosis was not assessed on the majority of studies. In addition, ultrasound contrast enhancing agents were not administered in the majority of patients to minimize acquisition time for the sonographers in the setting of COVID-19. Second, some patients were placed in the prone position due to advanced respiratory failure, and thus could not have an echocardiogram study performed. Third, this was a retrospective analysis with data obtained at a single center, and echocardiograms were only performed on patients that had requests placed by the primary providers. As a result, we cannot exclude selection bias. Fourth, RV longitudinal strain by 2D speckle tracking to objectively assess RV systolic function was not performed. Fifth, although we had many significant associations which suggests that for those associations that the study was adequately powered, it is possible that our non-significant associations were not adequately powered. Sixth, this is a cross-sectional study that can only report associations of variables. A clinical trial is necessary to determine if our predictors lead to and cause the outcomes. Seventh, obesity and tobacco use are known risk factors for adverse outcomes. However, due to unknown data in many patients, we could not adjust for these factors in our analyses. Eighth, we did not have the exact time the laboratory variables were obtained and included laboratory variables to describe the sample.",
