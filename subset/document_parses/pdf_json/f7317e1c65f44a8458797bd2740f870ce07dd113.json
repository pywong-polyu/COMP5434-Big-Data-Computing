Various clinical presentations have surfaced up among which confusion or disorientation is the most frequent. Among the laboratory parameters, raised CRP and D-dimer are most prominent findings. Analysis of CSF parameters reveals, high protein and lymphocytic pleocytosis are the most observable abnormalities. Focal epileptiform discharges and slowing of background are common EEG abnormalities observed in COVID-19 related meningoencephalitis. A myriad of radiological abnormalities have been observed of which temporal lobar hyper-intensity and diffusion restriction are common. This review has attempted to provide a basic outline of COVID-19 related meningoencephalitis from a clinician's perspective. Hopefully with increment in reporting of neurological manifestations of COVID-19, a clearer picture will become available towards the future.7-Acknowledgement-We are sincerely thankful to Rohan Sarkhel (Department of Computer ScienceEngineering,Maulana Abul Kalam Azad University,India) for preparing illustration for this paper.Reference-1.
