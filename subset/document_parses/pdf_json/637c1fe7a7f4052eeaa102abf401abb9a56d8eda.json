Small molecule chemical probes offer to both reveal novel aspects of virus replication and to serve as leads for antiviral therapeutic development. The RNA-biased amiloride scaffold was recently tuned to target a viral RNA structure critical for translation in enterovirus 71, ultimately uncovering a novel mechanism to modulate positive-sense RNA viral translation and replication. Analysis of CoV RNA genomes reveal many conserved RNA structures in the 5'-UTR and proximal region critical for viral translation and replication, including several containing bulge-like secondary structures suitable for small molecule targeting. Following phylogenetic conservation analysis of this region, we screened an amiloride-based small molecule library against a less virulent human coronavirus, OC43, to identify lead ligands. Amilorides inhibited OC43 replication as seen in viral plaque assays. Select amilorides also potently inhibited replication competent SARS-CoV-2 as evident in the decreased levels of cell free virions in cell culture supernatants of treated cells. Reporter screens confirmed the importance of RNA structures in the 5'-end of the viral genome for small molecule activity. Finally, NMR chemical shift perturbation studies of the first six stem loops of the 5'-end revealed specific amiloride interactions with stem loops 4, 5a, and 6, all of which contain bulge like structures and were predicted to be strongly bound by the lead amilorides in retrospective docking studies. Taken together, the use of multiple orthogonal approaches allowed us to identify the first small molecules aimed at targeting RNA structures within the 5'-UTR and proximal region of the CoV genome. These molecules will serve as chemical probes to further understand CoV RNA biology and can pave the way for the development of specific CoV RNA-targeted antivirals.",

SARS-CoV-2 is the etiological agent of the COVID-19 respiratory disease, the largest scale respiratory virus pandemic the world has witnessed since the 1918 Spanish flu 1 and that has claimed more than 1.4 million lives worldwide. 2 Coronaviruses (CoV family) generally cause mild flu-like symptoms 3 in humans but have caused two smaller scale pandemics in the last two decades: SARS-CoV (2003) and MERS (2012) 4 . Recent phylogenetic mapping traced all human coronaviruses to animal origins. 5 While the middle zoonotic carrier of the virus between the animal of origin and humans seem to vary between CoVs, the chronological surfacing of human CoV pandemics seems to follow a dangerous trend of increasing lethality of each pandemic, thereby underscoring the need to a better understanding and targeting of the current and future CoV etiologic agents.",

            "text": "After more than a year since the first cases of SARS-CoV-2 human infection, this virus is expected to remain a global threat until vaccines are available and adopted worldwide. While recent treatments have been approved for use within hospital settings, 6 there are no known FDA approved cures for the infection. Current candidates for treatment have limited approval for emergency use in severe COVID-19 cases. Remdesivir, for example, is an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase inhibitor (RdRp) initially developed during the Ebola outbreak and revisited at the start of the pandemic. 7 The compassionate use of the candidate antiviral across many countries reported mixed results, with overall faster recovery time from the virus but no difference in mortality rates. 8 While more randomized trials are needed for a final verdict on the efficacy of Remdesivir in critical patients, its stereospecific multi-step synthetic process highlights the need for new, scalable and more efficacious antivirals. Baricitinib has been recently approved for emergency use for COVID-19 treatment in conjunction with Remdesivir. Also known as Olumiant, this small molecule was approved in 2018 as treatment for moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis. 9 It is proposed that the anti-inflammatory effects of the drug help in decreasing inflammatory cascades associated with COVID-19. While promising, Baricitinib has yet to receive approval as a stand-alone treatment and, so far, has been shown to improve recovery time by one day when compared to Remdesivir alone treatment. 6 Overall, SARS-CoV-2 is not the first and, most likely, will not be the last CoV pandemic. The current limited tools and lack of novel cures underscore the need for a new approach in developing antivirals that would not only provide novel routes to combat the current pandemic but also provide invaluable information on targetable structures that can aid in the prevention of and fight against future CoV outbreaks.",

            "text": "Several steps in the coronavirus replication cycle offer potential therapeutic targets for viral inhibition (Figure 1) . Coronaviruses are enveloped positive single-stranded RNA genomes of approximately 30 kilobases, making them the largest genomes of RNA viruses. 4 SARS-CoV-2 infects human cells by engagement of the ACE2 receptor by the viral spike (S) protein followed by membrane fusion at the plasma membrane or endosomal membranes depending on the availability of host cell proteases that cleave and prime S for entry. Fusion results in the release of its positive sense genome and associated proteins in the host cell cytosol. The genome is translated into two large polyproteins, 1a and 1b, which are then processed into individual proteins by the viral protease. Synthesis of full length negative strand RNA by products of 1a/1b creates a template to synthesize multiple positive strand copies encapsidated by the viral nucleoprotein into virions. 4 The negative RNA strand also serves as a template for the synthesis of shorter sub-genomic RNAs (sgRNA) that include the essential structural proteins and thus also constitute an attractive therapeutic target. 10 CoV antivirals to date have been developed to target viral proteins, including to prevent endocytosis, assembly of viral protein for export, and condensation of viral genome for packaging. 12 While this protein-centric approach has proven successful in a few cases, the sequence and structural conservation of RNA structural motifs pose an attractive complementary target 13 for small molecule antiviral development, a strategy that has shown promise against a plethora of viruses. 14 Recently published data on genome-wide secondary structure of the virus obtained by in vitro and in vivo SHAPE [15] [16] [17] and DMS [17] [18] [19] probing on SARS-CoV-2 infected Vero E6 cells, as well as NMR characterization, 19 recapitulates the computationally predicted stem loops (SL) at the 5' region of the genome (Figure 2 ) as well other relevant frameshifting and replication-related structures. Conserved elements at the 5' and 3'-ends have been identified across many members of the coronavirus family and function as cis acting elements regulating viral replication. 20 Specifically, studies on murine and bovine coronaviruses showed that phylogenetically conserved stem loops in the 5'-UTR are capable of long-range RNA-RNA and protein-RNA interactions responsible for optimal viral replication. 21, 22 More recently, studies aimed at uncovering the pathway that leads to viral protein synthesis via host cell translation machinery revealed that the presence of the full length 5'-UTR of SARS-CoV-2 leads to a five-fold increase in translation of viral proteins. This preliminary data corroborates the importance of the 5'-UTR region, and the structures within, for efficient viral translation and provides context for the viral hijacking of the host cell translational machinery. 23 Drug-like small molecules offer the ability to develop chemical probes that reveal function and to design bioavailable clinical candidates for treatment. While RNA targeting has lagged behind protein targeting, recent successes in both the laboratory and the clinic support its potential role. The first US FDA approved small molecule targeting RNA other than the ribosome was approved for treatment of spinal muscular atrophy in August of 2020. 24 Effective small molecule targeting in the laboratory has also been observed for a plethora of disease relevant RNAs, including viral RNAs. Specifically, small molecules targeting structures within the 5'-UTR region have shown antiviral activity for a number of positive-sense RNA viruses such as HCV 25 , FMDV 26 , and EV71. 27 At the same time, recent studies have begun evaluating the potential of small molecules against the frameshifting elements of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the coding region. These recent studies include evaluation of known SARS-CoV pseudoknot binders 28 as well as development of a small molecule binder to the attenuator hairpin preceding the pseudoknot. 29 Coupling of the latter to the known ribonuclease targeting chimera (RIBOTAC) technology results in recruitment of cellular ribonucleases leading to viral genomic RNA degradation. While the anti-replicative activity of these molecules has not been published, these preliminary results, combined with known RNA-targeted antivirals for other positive sense RNA viruses, stand as proof-of concept of the targetability of SARS-CoV-2 RNA motifs.",

The DMA scaffold had been previously reported to be poised for tuning for specific RNA constructs via a facile three-step synthesis. 31 Further investigation and functionalization of the scaffold resulted in a bioactive antiviral analogue that formed a repressive ternary complex with IRES stem loop II RNA and the human AUF1 protein, ultimately inhibiting translation and compromising viral replication. The successes in DMA exploration highlight the scaffold's potential for tuning as well as broad applicability as an antiviral scaffold. 31 Herein we report DMA analogues that show promising antiviral properties by reducing SARS-CoV-2 viral titer in a dose-dependent manner in infected Vero E6 cells. In addition, dual luciferase reporter assays confirmed the antiviral activity of the small molecules to be dependent on the 5'-UTR and proximal region of the SARS-CoV-2 genome. Investigation of possible conserved RNA binding sites of the lead small molecules revealed putative bulge-like binding sites in stem loops 4 and 5a, located in the 5'-UTR of the SARS-CoV-2 genome, as well as in the adjacent stem loop 6 located in ORF1a, supporting both the targetability of 5'-region stem loops and the combination of interdisciplinary methods used here as a promising approach to novel anti-SARS-CoV-2 small molecules.",

We constructed a multiple sequence alignment spanning the 5'UTR and the adjacent region including representatives of all five betacoronavirus subgenera (Figure 3) . Alignments disclosed the highest degree of conservation in the region encoding SLs 2-3, both of which are relatively short and contain stretches of 5-6 nucleotides that are 100% conserved. By contrast, SL1 and SLs 4-6 are less conserved, but notably, four of the five SLs that span the 5'UTR contain stretches of relatively highly conserved nucleotide sequence (i.e. 70-100% conservation across the genus). The position of these SL's within or adjacent to the 5'UTR (which is relatively conserved in length across all betacoronaviruses) indicates these conserved regions are likely to represent homologous nucleotides and suggests they are to some degree functionally equivalent.

The same experiments were repeated three times with DMA-132, -135, and -155 and shown to be reproducible ( Figure S2 ).

            "text": "Antiviral activity of the two most active DMA leads (DMA-132 and -135) was confirmed using Vero E6 cells infected with wild-type SARS-CoV-2; DMA-155 was not tested. Small molecule treatment was performed at 10 \u00b5M and 50 \u00b5M, respectively. DMA-132 and 135 showed significant dose-dependent reduction in viral titer compared to DMSO, as measured by median tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50) assay, without measurable effect on cellular viability as measured by ATP content (Figure 6) . Notably, DMA-132 and 135 have improved activity when compared to DMA-01, the parent scaffold, thereby corroborating the potential for synthetic tunability of DMAs for SARS-CoV-2 targeting. DMA-132, 135, and 155 were tested for longer term (96 hour) toxicity in Vero E6 cells. Small molecules do not significantly reduce cell viability < 10 \u00b5M, supporting a potential therapeutic window, though more extensive cytotoxicity studies are warranted. In particular, Figure S3 shows the CC50 of DMA-132 and -135 in Vero E6 cells were > 100 \u00b5M. CC50 of DMA-155 was about 90 \u00b5M. To assess the effect of DMAs on reporter gene expression directed by SARS-CoV-2 sequence elements, a reporter plasmid, pCoV2-5\u2032UTR-FLuc-3'UTR was used as template for in vitro synthesis of CoV-2-5\u2032UTR-FLuc-3'UTR RNA ( Figure 7A ). This plasmid contains the 5'-end 805 nucleotide (nt) segment from the virus genome and the 3'UTR. Thus, the 805 nt segment spans the genomic RNA 5'UTR (SL 1-5) and ORF1a encoding a portion of nsp1 (including SL 6-8) fused in-frame with the firefly luciferase ORF. Plasmid pRL was used as template for the synthesis of control Renilla luciferase reporter RNA lacking SARS-Cov-2 sequences. The RNAs were co-transfected and various concentrations of DMAs were added with the transfections. Two days after transfection, RLuc and FLuc activities were measured using a dual-luciferase reporter assay. As shown in Figure 7A , addition of 10 \u00b5M DMA-132 or -135 reduced FLuc activity, which is under the control of SARS-CoV-2 5'-end and 3'UTR, by approximately 50%. Addition of 10 \u00b5M DMA-155 reduced FLuc activity by ~ 90%. FLuc activity was reduced 90% with 100 \u00b5M of DMA-132, -135 or -155. Activities of the control RLuc remained relatively constant for all DMAs across all concentrations tested; this control indicates that decreases in FLuc were not simply due to any putative cytotoxic effects. To test whether the CoV-2 3'UTR contributes to DMA-mediated translational repression, we repeated the experiment using a FLuc reporter, CoV-2-5'UTR-FLuc RNA, in which the CoV-2 3'UTR was replaced with vector-encoded sequence; thus, the CoV-2 5'-ends of both FLuc reporter RNAs are the same (Figure 7B) . The effects of DMAs on translational repression were virtually identical to those in Figure 7A . Importantly, these results clearly demonstrate that DMA-dependent suppression of SARS-CoV-2 luciferase reporter activity requires only 5'-end sequences of the virus. ",

            "text": "Towards understanding potential mechanisms by which the DMAs inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication, we carried out single-point 13 C-1 H TROSY HSQC titrations of DMA-132, -135 and -155 into stem loops 1-6 (SL1-6) of the 5'-region. We reasoned that the DMAs selectively bind the 5'-region stem loops at non-canonical structural elements such as bulge, internal or apical loops. Therefore, we in vitro transcribed isolated SL domains using 13 C/ 15 N rNTPs that would maximize NMR signal detection for the non-canonical elements over the base paired regions (Figure S5 ). For example, SL1 was prepared as a C( 13 C/ 15 N)-selectively labeled construct because cytosines are the most abundant nucleobases within its apical and internal loops. Using this strategy, we are able to efficiently profile each 5'-region SL to determine if the DMAs bind with reasonable affinity and specificity. Figure S5 summarizes the effects that the addition of excess (5:1) DMAs have on the NMR spectra of each major SL domain. First, we observed that the DMAs induced differential chemical shift perturbations (CSPs) for each SL with the largest CSPs observed in spectra recorded for SLs 4, 5a and 6 ( Figure 8) . Each of these 5'-domains contain large internal loops. Second, only a subset of the 13 C-1 H correlation peaks is perturbed in the spectra providing evidence that the DMAs interact through specific surfaces of the 5'-region. Third, the extent of the CSPs are also differential with some DMAs inducing shifts of the correlation peaks to new positions within the spectra, and others inducing complete broadening of the NMR signals. These variable CSPs reveal that the DMAs interact with different binding affinities and binding modes. Of note, none of the DMAs caused significant changes to spectra recorded on SL2, which contains a 5nt CUUGU apical loop. Taken together, the single-point 13 C-1 H TROSY HSQC titrations provide compelling evidence that the DMAs make specific interactions with the SARS-CoV-2 5'-region via surfaces composed of non-canonical structural elements.

Hit ligands DMA-132, 135, and 155 were among the top predicted binding ligands. Furthermore, if the docked structures are limited to the sub-library of DMAs tested against OC43 and SARS-CoV-2 the three hit ligands score in the top 5 of every stem loop. Notably, when analyzing the binding location that yielded the best docking scores of the three hit molecules against SL6 we note that while DMA 135 and 155 bind best in one binding pocket (Figure 9C in blue), DMA 132 docks best in the adjacent binding pocket (Figure 9C red) . When comparing the NMR profiles of the three small molecules we note that DMA 135 and 155 have a similar perturbation pattern, while DMA 132 has a slightly different profile, suggesting a possible different binding mode. This trend is recapitulated with SL5a where all three hits dock in three separate but adjacent binding pockets ( Figure  9E,F) and, while all three perturb some common signals, all three molecules have a distinct NMR profile. While preliminary, this docking analysis corroborates the NMR data and the fitness of these ligands for SARS-CoV-2 5'-stem loop targeting and supports its utility as a tool in the identification of new SARS-CoV-2 RNA-targeting ligands.

SARS-CoV-2 also contains a highly conserved 5'-end 37 that is reported to play a crucial role in viral replication and hijacking of host cell translational machinery. The presence of multiple bulge or internal loops, the secondary structural elements that amilorides have been reported to bind most effectively, makes the 5'-UTR and the adjacent SL6 ideal therapeutically relevant targets for small molecule probing. An initial DMA focused library screen against OC43-infected Vero E6 cells allowed for the identification of three lead compounds, namely DMA-132, -135, and -155 that significantly reduced viral titer. Initial structure-activity relationships could also be resolved, highlighting the critical substitution of the dimethylamine group at the C5 position and rigid aromatic substituents at the C6 position. These molecules were also found to be active against SARS-CoV-2 in both screening-format qRT-PCR assays and authentic antiviral titers. Luciferase assays revealed the presence of the 5'-UTR and proximal region as necessary and sufficient for translation inhibition upon small molecule treatment.",

Notably SL6, which contains a moderately conserved and weakly paired ~16-nt bulge loop, showed the most significant CSPs when titrated with DMAs. Interestingly, the 5'-side of the SL6 bulge loop has been proposed to interact with the SARS-CoV-2 Nucleocapsid (N) protein under phase separation conditions and may also impact genome packaging. 38 We will investigate the modulation of the N protein:SL6 interaction as a potential antiviral mechanism in future work.",

Once characterized, we expect these amiloride-based ligands to serve as chemical biology tools to help understand CoV RNA molecular biology, such as N-dependent genome packaging and other cellular stages of the viral RNA replication process. Importantly, we have established an efficient framework to identify novel RNA-targeted CoV antivirals that will serve not only the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic but future coronavirus pandemics.",

Serial dilutions of supernatant from the treated cells were added to VeroE6 cells in 96 well plates and cells are monitored for cytopathic effect (CPE). Viral titer was calculated from the numbers of positive wells using a modified Reed and Muench method. and purification of RNA stem loop constructs present at 5'-end SL1 through 6 of the 5'-end were in vitro transcribed using a standard protocol,44, 45 from synthetic DNA templates from Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA). The 3-6 ml reactions involved the use of purified recombinant T7 RNA polymerase expressed in BL21 (DE3) cells. Depending on the labeling scheme of each RNA, double labeled, 13 C and 15 N, rNTPs and unlabeled rNTPs were utilized in the reaction. Nucleotide labeling of the SLs was based on the abundance of nucleotides in bulges and loops. The labeling pattern was as follows: SL1 C( 13 C, 15 N)-labeled, SL2 U( 13 C, 15 N)-labeled, SL3 AU( 13 C, 15 N)labeled, SL4 A( 13 C, 15 N)-labeled, SL5a AU( 13 C, 15 N)-labeled, SL5b AU( 13 C, 15 N)-labeled, and SL6 AC( 13 C, 15 N)-labeled.Next, the SLs were purified on denaturing gels, ranging from 8 to 16%, and extracted using electroelution. After desalting with a Millipore Amicon Ultra-4 centrifugal filter, the RNAs were annealed by heating for 2 min at 95 \u00b0C and flash-cooled on ice. The samples were thoroughly washed and concentrated down with a 100% D2O buffer of 25mM K2HPO4, 50mM KCl at pH 6.2. Using the NanoDrop TM 2000 software (Thermo Fisher), the theoretical extinction coefficients of the SLs were calculated in order to determine RNA concentrations. Samples for NMR titrations contained 100\u00b5M of RNA in D2O buffer with a final volume of 200\u00b5L.NMR profiling of DMA interactions with 5' end structuresA 900 MHz spectrometer was used to record all NMR data. The 1 H-13 C HSQC titrations were recorded with 100 \u00b5M of selectively labeled SL1 through 6 in a 100% D2O buffer of 25mM K2HPO4, 50mM KCl at pH 6.2 with a 200\u00b5L sample volume. Titrations of the DMA molecules into the different SLs were collected at a molar ratio of 5:1, DMA to RNA, at a temperature of either 298, 303, or 308K. For each construct, temperature optimization experiments were done in order to determine the optimum temperature to conduct the titrations with. The NMR spectra were processed using NMRPipie/NMRDraw 46 and analyzed with NMRView 47 J or Sparky 48Virtual Ligand Screening against SARS-CoV-2 5'-end RNA structuresFARFAR model generationFARFAR is part of the Rosetta 3 software package can be obtained for free academic usage (https://www.rosettacommons.org/software/license-and-download).
