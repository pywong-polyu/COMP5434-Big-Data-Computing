Nowadays, the possibility of replacing in vitro and in vivo experiments with computer simulations is no longer a chimera. Both data-driven and mechanistic models can be used to suggest novel biomarkers, to predict the occurrence of heart attacks, to select best epitopes for novel vaccines, to test novel and existing pharmaceutical compounds by means of computer simulations, to realize \"virtual patients\" that can be enrolled into clinical trials in addition to real patients for augmenting statistical evidence.",

Several ICU scoring systems have been developed and are used to predict clinical outcome of ICU patients. These scores are calculated from clinical physiological and biochemical characteristics of patients. Heart rate variability (HRV) is a correlate of cardiac autonomic regulation and has been evident as a marker of poor clinical prognosis. In their work, Zhang et al. [5] found a feature extraction strategy that was applied to measure the HRV fluctuation during time. A prediction model was developed based on HRV measures with genetic algorithm (GA) for feature selection. The result was compared with earlier reported scoring systems, encouraging further development and practical application.

Various cancer types overexpress PD-L1 to evade the immune system by inducing apoptosis in tumor-specific CD8+ T cells. Roither et al. [7] present the results of the first molecular dynamics simulations of PD-1 with a complete extracellular domain, focusing on the role of the BC-loop of PD-1 upon binding PD-L1 or nivolumab.

Although huge strides have been made over the years, MS etiology remains partially unknown. Furthermore, the presence of various endogenous and exogenous factors can greatly influence the immune response of different individuals, making it difficult to study and understand the disease. Pernice et al. [8] propose a new model to study the immune response in relapsing remitting MS (RRMS), the most common form of MS that is characterized by alternate episodes of symptom exacerbation (relapses) with periods of disease stability (remission). In this new model, both the peripheral lymphonode/blood vessel and the central nervous system are explicitly represented. The model was created and analysed using Epimod, our recently developed general framework for modeling complex biological systems.",

This has been achieved through the creation of the initial immune system repertoire in a stochastic way, and through the identification of a vector of features that combines both biological and pathophysiological parameters, personalising the digital patient to reproduce the physiology and the pathophysiology of the subject. In their work, Juarez et al. [9] , propose a sequential approach to sampling from the joint features population distribution for the creation of a cohort of virtual patients with some specific characteristics. This resembles the recruitment process for the target clinical trial, which then can be used for augmenting the information from the physical the trial to help reduce its size and duration.",
