They are integral leaders present at each of our hospitals, post-acute facilities, clinical service lines, and major corporate shared service locations.

For intensive care, extubated patients' first requests were to see their family and we were able to fulfill that emotional request. In emergency departments, step down and medical-surgical units, technology provided visual reassurance of a patient's medical condition and emotional state.

By personally expressing deep appreciation for coming to work, providing quality compassionate care and hearing firsthand of barriers and/or innovative ideas, staff expressed feeling cared for and supported. Instead of solely focusing on mortality rates and code prevalence, \"Win Boards\" were placed at employee entrances, highlighting the number of patients' extubated and breathing on their own, discharged to home, and enrolled in clinical trials. Music played a major role in spreading positivity with hospitals gravitating to symbolic songs such as \"Here Comes the Sun\" and \"Don't Stop Believing.\" It became their rallying cry that good things are happening daily amidst immense hardship. Those songs or melodic chimes were routinely played overhead during positive patient milestones. These visual and auditory cues uplifted employees, reinvigorating them to core values and purpose.",

The outpouring of cheers, well wishes, and fond farewells was incredibly moving and touching.

Chalk drawings of inspirational words, quotes, and images were hand-drawn on employee entry sidewalks and pathways. Members of Fire Department New York (FDNY) and New York Police Department (NYPD) lined outside hospitals and post-acute facilities, applauding health care workers during change of shift ( Figure 1 ). All of New York participated within their local communities, with people cheering and applauding from their apartment balconies, building rooftops, and house front porches. Children wrote letters of thanks and drew pictures of our health care heroes-doctors, nurses, therapists, and workers all proudly wearing capes. The community outpouring has been overwhelming with donations of meals, snacks, fresh fruit and vegetables, iPads and tablets, and monetary contributions. Throughout this crisis, OPCE and culture leaders have played an absolute essential role in delicately balancing the needs of patients, families, and our employees. Each day posed different challenges due to new mandates, updated protocols, volume surges, and operational logistics. We leveraged our organization's core values of teamwork, collaboration, and partnership as well as the culture leader network to successfully and quickly implement many of the large-scale system programming and best practices. However, during this crisis, what stands out most, is the compassion, humanity, camaraderie and outpouring of community love that once again defines the heart of New York. The role of the Patient Experience leader after COVID-19 will continue to evolve as we learn, adapt, question, and innovate. It is during these most challenging times we realize the incredible honor and privilege we have working in health care. At Northwell, we know this storm will pass, the sun will rise again and our New Yorker families will be restored with renewed strength, resolve, and resilience.",
