Recent studies postulated that OS could be at the crossroad between inflammation and microvascular dysfunction [6, 7] . In addition to neutrophil infiltration and excessive release of reactive oxygen species (ROS), viral infections were shown to decrease antioxidant defenses [8] . Deleterious action of ROS on alveolar epithelial and endothelial cell functions could be a major contributor for hypoxic respiratory failure observed in the most severe cases of COVID-19 [9] . SARS-CoV-2 infection can also lead to cellular damage which can initiate toxic and inflammatory stress responses [10] . OS causes molecular modifications such as carbonylation of albumin and formation of advanced oxidation protein products (AOPP), the latter being good indicators of the extent of oxidative damage. Moreover, ROS injury induces structural changes in the N-terminal region of albumin that can be evaluated by the determination of ischemia-modified albumin (IMA). Finally, antioxidant status can be easily evaluated by measuring total plasmatic thiol.",

Critical COVID-19 patients were more frequently men and presented more frequently cardiovascular disease, being overweight, high blood pressure, dyspnea, and fever, in comparison to lower stages. Fifty-one out of 54 ventilated stage 3 patients had orotracheal intubation. Critical patients also presented higher CRP and fibrinogen levels, leucocytes and neutrophils, and showed lower hemoglobin and albumin concentrations. Furthermore, age, increased oxygen needs, ICU admission and length of stay increased across disease severity. Finally, all deceased patients (n = 17) were observed amongst critical COVID-19 patients.

Our results may indicate that the antioxidant status in the plasma of patients with COVID-19 depends on inflammatory status. Our study confirmed data from previous studies because we found that IL-6, CRP, PSEP and calprotectin were associated with worse outcomes [13] [14] [15] . In our study, calprotectin was the best biomarker to predict mortality (AUC = 0.792), with an optimal threshold at 24.1 mg/L (94% sensitivity and 65% specificity), and survival curves indicated that a calprotectin concentration >24.1 mg/L was associated with a significant increase of 25% in risk of mortality. The expression of calprotectin is predominantly restricted to the intracellular compartment of neutrophil granulocytes. In contrast to routinely used inflammatory biomarkers such as C-reactive protein (CRP) and procalcitonin (PCT), calprotectin is released into the bloodstream without de novo protein biosynthesis. This reflects the activation of neutrophils, probably by cytokines, leading to the release of ROS in high amounts. Thus, calprotectin might be correlated to the levels of circulating neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) [16] . Therefore, circulating calprotectin elevation might be one of the first responses of an organism to an inflammatory disease. Indeed, calprotectin was better than CRP and PCT for admitting COVID-19 patients to the ICU, with an AUC at 0.80 (vs. 0.66 and 0.60, respectively) [17, 18] . Considering our results, we may hypothesize that while thiol seems to be the leader in predicting ICU admission, inflammatory biomarkers such as IL-6 and calprotectin may be 'worsening' detectors and mortality predictors: these observations are in accordance with what was previously observed [19] .",

Finally, in a stepwise logistic regression we found that being overweight, having dyspnoea, and thiol and IL-6 were independently associated with ICU admission. Plasma thiol concentration may represent a clinically useful risk stratification tool that provides important insights in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Our results are in line with those of Kalem et al. that showed a predictive value of total and native thiol in the diagnosis of COVID-19 and in determining disease severity [20] . The single thiol of human serum albumin (HSA) is the most abundant plasma thiol (400-600 \u00b5mol/L) and is, for the most part, reduced (75%); the other low molecular weight thiol constitutes only 12-20 \u00b5mol/L [21] . Thus, the decrease in total thiol in the plasma mainly reflects the decrease of reduced albumin. Among the 585 amino acid residues in HSA, Methionine-6 and the Cysteine-34 accounted for 40-80% of the total antioxidant activity of HSA [22] and were determined to be the preferred plasma scavenger of reactive oxygen species [23] .",

These stable final products are considered to be good indicators of the extent of oxidative damage. It was demonstrated that free radical injury induces structural changes in the N-terminal region of HSA. The ability of HSA to bind transition metal ions such as cobalt, copper and nickel is reduced [24] and can be evaluated by the determination of IMA. We showed the increase of IMA and AOPP concentrations in plasma of patients with COVID-19. IMA and AOPP were inversely correlated with thiol (\u22120.506, p < 0.001; \u22120.313, p < 0.001, respectively). HSA may undergo irreversible oxidation, which impairs its antioxidant property. We observed lower values of HSA in the group of critical patients. These results are consistent with a systematic review study that showed that 75.8% of patients with COVID-19 presented decreased amounts of albumin [25] . In our study, HSA was correlated with thiol in plasma from COVID-19 patients (r = 0.615, p < 0.001). Therefore, hypoalbuminemia observed in COVID-19 patients may have several explanations. Hypoalbuminemia is a feature of inflammation as confirmed in our study by the inverse relation between albumin and CRP or IL-6, but it might also the consequence of a high clearance of oxidized form of albumin.",

Less availability of reduced thiol may play a role in the interaction of viral spike protein of the SARS-CoV-2 and the functional receptor for the SARS coronaviruses, namely the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Molecular dynamic simulations showed that the binding affinity was significantly impaired when all the disulphide bonds of both ACE2 and viral spike proteins were reduced to thiol groups and provided a molecular basis for the severity of COVID-19 infection due to oxidative stress [26, 27] .",

Comparison of areas under ROC curves was performed. The normality of the distribution was tested with the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test for all investigated biomarkers. When the distribution was not normal, a log-transformation was performed. Log-transformed values were therefore used in subsequent analysis (correlation and logistic regression). Correlation between biomarkers was assessed using Spearman rank correlation in order to determine the multicollinearity between two variables. Collinearity provide the possibility of including only one of the two variables in the same regression model [33] . A stepwise logistic regression was performed to assess variables associated with ICU-admission and mortality. Biomarkers were selected in the model according to their pathophysiological category (oxidative stress, inflammation, neutrophilic activation), and variables of the same category but less performant in univariate analysis were excluded to avoid redundancy. Only variables with p values < 0.20 in the univariate analysis were included in the regression analysis. The discriminate power of the logistic regression was evaluated by the c-statistic (concordance index) and the goodness of fit of the model using the Hosmer-Lemeshow test. We also performed survival analysis building Kaplan-Meyer curves according to biomarker value. Survival time was defined as the time from hospital admission to the date of discharge or death.
