            "text": "Aim: To evaluate the University of Pavia students about physical activity (PA) changes before, during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: The International Physical Activity Questionnaires (IPAQ) survey was employed to evaluate the PA in three periods: the pre-pandemic period, during national stay-athome order (March 9 th -May 4 th 2020), current PA. Exercise intensity for each period was defined using the Metabolic Equivalent of Task (Met) as unit of measurement. The questionnaire was administered online to university students from June 9 th to July 4 th 2021, structured in four sections, also collecting demographic data. Results: 55,6% of the study population reported a significant decrease in PA during lockdown. The number of active/very active subjects dropped from 72.2% in pre-pandemic period to 29.6% during containment measures. 50% reported a substantial increase in moving out of the lockdown. Stay-at-home order was associated with an increase in sedentary lifestyle (68.5%), which sharply decreased moving out from lockdown (two-third of study population). Average time in minutes spent sitting was 612 before pandemic, 844 during the pandemic and 670 after social restrictions. Conclusions: Lockdown had a negative impact on PA among the university students leading to an increase in sedentary behaviours. Following the gradual relaxation of the restrictive measures, situation has improved, without however returning to pre-pandemic level. It is of fundamental importance to study new strategies to promote healthy lifestyles while coping with the on-going pandemic. (www.actabiomedica.it)",

Physical activity refers to all movement including during leisure time, for transport to get to and from places, or as part of a person's work (1) . Moderate physical activity of any kind, on a regular basis, is an important protective factor against metabolic as well as cardiovascular diseases and reduces mortality by 20%-35% (2) . Active lifestyles need to be encouraged through information campaigns, educating people on the multiple benefits of a regular physical activity. The Italian National Institute of Health recommends several actions to promote sport, including increasing the amount of time devoted to physical activity (both in and out of school), organising sporting events in social settings, involving citizens, encouraging physical activities in the workplace as well as promoting the development of urban environments motivating people to take up physical activity (3) . Physical exercise leads also to a reduction in public health costs. A study showed that in most countries, the highest health expenditure is determined by cardiovascular diseases, which account for between 12% and 16.5% of total health expenditure. For the remaining non-communicable chronic diseases, expenditure varies from 0.7% to 7.4% (4) . According to an estimate, physical inactivity cost international health systems $53.8 billion worldwide in 2013 (3) .",

Physical activity is also classified according to the type of activity (aerobic, strength, flexibility, balance), intensity, which can be moderate (when requires three to six times the amount of oxygen consumed while sitting at rest) or vigorous (when requires more than six times the amount of oxygen consumed while sitting at rest), duration and frequency.",

Physical inactivity and sedentary behaviour are important health risk factors. Lack of physical exercise increases the risk of chronic non-communicable diseases such as coronary heart disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus, breast and colon cancer and, consequently, reduces life expectancy. This represents a huge public health problem. Physical inactivity is the fourth most common risk factor for death worldwide and WHO estimates that 1.9 million deaths occur each year due to insufficient physical activity. To counter this trend, the WHO has implemented a global plan for physical activity from 2018 to 2030 to increase the number of active people and the health threshold worldwide: \"Global action plan on physical activity 2018-2030: more active people for healthier world\" (5) . These are policies to support physical activity for a healthier world and aim to reduce physical inactivity by 10% by 2025 and 15% by 2030. Active living is influenced by the sociocultural context and countless individual variables. The strategies in this plan include several policy and actions. The objectives are: \"creating active societies\", to promote knowledge and greater awareness of the multiple benefits of consistently practised physical activity; \"create active environments\", to create and maintain places that enable people to access safe spaces in their cities and communities in which they can exercise regularly; \"create active people\", to design and deliver ageand lifestyle-friendly programmes and opportunities to encourage healthy living in multiple settings; \"create active systems\", to orient governments to promote physical activity and health as much as secure the investments needed to strengthen the work of managing and coordinating physical activity promotion. In 2020, due to the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic, containment measures have undoubtedly caused changes in people's lifestyle (6) , affecting many aspects: mental health was impacted (7) as well as dietary habits, alcohol consumption, gambling (8) and smoking (9) . There was a strong impact also on physical activity due to lockdown restrictions that led to the closure of gyms, swimming pools and all sports venues.",

Table 1 reports Met variation over the study periods. In the pre-pandemic period, 72.2% were active/ very active, with only 24.1% sufficiently active and 3.7% inactive. Looking at the period during the pandemic, there was a decrease in the number of active/ very active subjects, down to 29.6%, with an increase in the number of sufficiently active subjects, 46.3%, and inactive subjects, 24.1%. During the last 7 days, there was an increase in active/very active subjects, 57.4%, with sufficiently active subjects dropping to 31.5% and inactive subjects dropping to 11.1%.

The study showed that in the pre-pandemic period the average number of minutes spent sitting was 612, during the pandemic it was 844 minutes and in the last seven days it was 670. We evaluated how this sedentary behaviour changed in the following three transition periods: prepandemic/ pandemic period, pandemic/last 7 days, prepandemic/last 7 days, as shown in Figure 2 . As can be seen, the lockdown caused an increase in time spent sitting, compared to before the pandemic, for 68.5% of the study population; only 14.8% of the subjects reported a reduction in sedentariness; instead, for 16.7%, the pandemic did not bring about any change. Figure 2 shows that the end of the lockdown and certain restrictions resulted in a reduction in time spent sitting for 66.7% of the subjects; 18.5% stated that time spent sitting remained unchanged; for 14.8% it even increased. The study also assessed how the advent of the pandemic had modified sedentary behaviour compared to the previous period. From Figure 2 it emerges that 38.9% of the subjects in the study had reduced the time spent sitting in the last seven days compared with the pre-pandemic period; 33.3% declared an increase; finally 27.8% of the sample stated that there had been no significant change.",

Interestingly, the intensity of physical activity among the respondents has increased in the recent period following the relaxation of pandemic restrictions, and the distribution in the different intensity categories is again very similar to the pre-pandemic period. However, the percentage of students reporting intense physical activity when completing the questionnaire remains lower than pre-pandemic. These results can be attributed to several reasons: primarily, during the first lockdown, the restrictions in place did not allow people to leave their homes even for a walk: most subjects therefore found themselves working and studying from remote, increasing the time spent sitting and decreasing the amount of time and intensity of their daily physical activity. Another reason that may have contributed to this outcome may have been the impossibility of attending sports centres and facilities such as gyms and swimming pools: people therefore found themselves having to exercise at home, often without having adequate equipment and space available for physical activity at home. All this may have contributed to students' demotivation since they could have been subjected to the psychological distress arising from the situation, affecting their level of daily physical activity. These findings are confirmed by studies that have already been carried out: an international online survey was launched in April 2019, which included the use of the IPAQ to assess the level of physical activity. From the study conducted by Ammar et al. (11) a reduction in physical activity during lockdown occurred: the number of minutes per day spent on physical exercise decreased by 33.5%, the number of minutes per day spent walking decreased by 34% and the number of hours per day spent sitting increased by 33.5%.",

In contrast, a minority of subjects reported an increased level of physical activity during the pandemic, thus using the restrictive measures as an opportunity to improve their lifestyle. These probably include individuals who had a sedentary job, led a busy life and did not have time to exercise; during the lockdown, they found themselves with more time to spend in physical activity.

According to the study, there was a sharp drop in the amount of physical activ-ity practised by University of Pavia students during the lockdown and it is not known how this might affect people's general health and wellbeing in the long run. An increase in physical activity accompanied by a reduction in sedentariness is nevertheless evident at the time of the survey. Although the results of the questionnaire seem not only interesting but also absolutely in line with the COVID-19 pandemic trend, it would be desirable from our point of view to continue the survey with larger and more heterogeneous samples. We know that inactivity and sedentariness are important health risk factors, increasing the risk of developing chronic non-communicable diseases and mental health distress (16) . It is therefore of fundamental importance to study new strategies to educate the population, encouraging people to practice physical activity and a healthy lifestyle. In this sense, both institutions, through programmes and information campaigns, and Exercise and Sport Sciences professionals, in their daily practice, can make a great contribution.",
