In this study, we test whether messages from religious leaders-trusted authorities in many communities worldwide-can change minds and shift norms around an issue related to conflict resolution: the reintegration of former members of violent extremist groups. Our study takes place in Maiduguri, Nigeria, the birthplace of the violent extremist group Boko Haram. Participants were randomly assigned to listen to either a placebo radio message or to a treatment message from a religious leader emphasizing the importance of forgiveness, announcing the leader's forgiveness of repentant fighters, and calling on followers to forgive. Participants were then asked about their attitudes, intended behaviors, and perceptions of social norms surrounding the reintegration of an ex-Boko Haram fighter. The religious leader message significantly increased support for reintegration and willingness to interact with the ex-fighter in social, political, and economic life (8 to 10 percentage points). It also shifted people's beliefs that others in their community were more supportive of reintegration (6 to 10 percentage points).

Acceptance is a collective process requiring the assent of many, such as government officials, community leaders, family members, future neighbors, and local business owners (24) . While the ultimate goal is to change behaviors to foster reintegration, governments and civil society must first address the reticence of communities to accept ex-fighters back home (15) . This process starts by changing community members' attitudes, intended behaviors, and perceived community norms (i.e., perceptions of what others in one's community think; refs. 25, 26) around reintegration. If most citizens are personally supportive of reintegration, intend to accept returning fighters, and believe others in their community are also supportive of reintegration, this will signal to government officials that reintegration efforts can begin, help prevent conflict when former combatants return home, and encourage the demobilization and return of former fighters ready to lay down arms.",

While considerable scholarship addresses why people join violent extremist groups, much less attention has been paid to how former members reenter society.

In this research, we find that radio messages delivered by trusted authorities in Nigeria lead to large, positive changes in people's willingness to accept former Boko Haram fighters back home and make people think their neighbors are more in favor of reintegration. Our results show that messages from leaders can create change on a mass scale at low cost, helping to end conflict and division.",

This intervention is promising because it has the potential to create change on a mass scale by spreading messages in the media and at large public gatherings. Converging evidence from political science and psychology on the effects of cues from elites, moral authorities, and group leaders suggests that messages from trusted authorities can be effective in both changing people's attitudes as well as shifting social norms. People often form beliefs and make decisions based on cues from their leaders (27) (28) (29) . Additionally, leaders' words and actions serve as signals of social norms: people assume that others in their community will observe and be influenced by their leader's messages or actions, which in turn can shift people's own attitudes and behaviors (30) (31) (32) .",

A likely explanation is that the message content is designed more to influence how people think about reintegration rather than how they feel about former Boko Haram affiliates.

            "text": "Our findings provide experimental evidence that messages from religious leaders can shift personal attitudes, intended behaviors, and perceived social norms around the reintegration of former members of a violent extremist group. After the intervention, people are more likely to say they will allow former members of Boko Haram to rejoin the community and participate actively in social, economic, and political life. They are also more likely to believe that their neighbors and local leaders are supportive of former members returning. These results are encouraging, because if even a small number of ex-members are reluctant to reintegrate due to fears that their communities won't accept them, the risks of instability remain. We consider this study to be a first step in a broader research agenda investigating whether religious authorities are effective messengers in conflict contexts and should be centrally involved in conflict resolution. In that spirit, we note here some limitations for our study that may inspire future research.",

While our goal for this particular study was to test whether messages from trusted authorities could change minds and shift norms in order to pave the way for peaceful reintegration, the question remains whether such messages would be effective at changing behaviors down the line and how long that effect might last. While behavioral intentions do not always predict future behavior, perceived social norms often do (32, 48) . Given this, as well as the brevity of our intervention and the magnitude of observed effects on attitudes, norms, and intended behaviors, we think there is reason for optimism that trusted authorities will also influence future reintegration behaviors. Additionally, we measure effects immediately after listening to the radio program. Due to respondent safety concerns, we were not able to collect follow-up data to examine whether the effects persist. Previous research finds mixed evidence as to whether a brief messaging or media intervention leads to lasting change (49) (50) (51) . It is possible-and perhaps even likely-that listening to one relatively short message from a religious leader may not lead to enduring effects. However, hearing repeated messages from religious leaders on the radio or in the mosque might be more likely to create lasting change.",
