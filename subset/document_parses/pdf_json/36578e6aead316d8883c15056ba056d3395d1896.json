When studying distances between clusters of multiple elements, it is also necessary to establish a method for calculating the distances of clusters. The analysis used the complete linkage method, also known as the farthest neighborhood method. The distance between clusters is the distance of the farthest elements of both clusters. After separating the clusters, it was examined whether they really differentiate the studied group. For this purpose, the Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) test with the significance level p < 0.05 was used. For all clusters, the means and medians were calculated for all variables [82, 83] .",

In other words, the mean values of almost all variables are significantly different in the three proposed groups of respondents.

Other factors include social recognition of the value of coffee and its stimulating \"magic effect\", as well as its physical impact on the body, e.g., the ability to aid digestion or increase blood pressure. The direct factors affecting the purchase of coffee are the price and the quality/price ratio, reported flavor and aroma, infusion intensity, and, above all, buying habits [77, 91] .

Home and work are the most popular places to drink coffee. A significant percentage of people participating in this study also mentioned caf\u00e9s (61.5%) and canteens (45.8%). Such a high proportion of coffee consumption in catering establishments is probably related to the specifics of our research group, which included people aged 18-65 years who were professionally active or studying. Such people are associated with a more mobile lifestyle, possibility of drinking coffee in a caf\u00e9 or for a social occasion, and also are more likely to drink their first coffee at home and another one at the workplace. The data from the \"Poland on a plate\" report [93] confirm this findings, while other data indicates that only 5-6% of Poles drink coffee in catering establishments [51, 74] . According to Euromonitor International Coffee [61] , the leading factors driving the growth of the coffee market are innovation in the field of consumption outside the home. The other authors [56] report that consumers who drink coffee in caf\u00e9s associate coffee with the attributes of happiness and joy, as well as companionship and stable interpersonal relationships.",
