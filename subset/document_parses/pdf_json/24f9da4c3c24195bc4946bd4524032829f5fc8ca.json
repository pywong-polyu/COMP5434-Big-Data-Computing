Early diagnosis and isolation are key to contain the rapid spread of the virus. Towards this goal, we report a simple, sensitive and rapid method to detect the virus using a targeted mass spectrometric approach, which can directly detect the presence of virus from naso-oropharyngeal swabs. Using a multiple reaction monitoring we can detect the presence of two peptides specific to SARS-CoV-2 in a 2.3 min gradient run with 100% specificity and 90.5% sensitivity when compared to RT-PCR. Importantly, we further show that these peptides could be detected even in the patients who have recovered from the symptoms and have tested negative for the virus by RT-PCR highlighting the sensitivity of the technique. This method has the translational potential of in terms of the rapid diagnostics of symptomatic and asymptomatic COVID-19 and can augment current methods available for diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2.",

More than 15 million individuals from 200 countries have been infected with this virus, which resulted in over 600,000 deaths (https ://www.world omete rs.info/coron aviru s). Disconcertingly, even after seven months from the first reported case in Wuhan, China, in December 2019 (Wang et al. 2020) , the number of cases are on the rise with more than 200,000 new cases being reported daily (https ://www.world omete rs.info/coron aviru s). One of the ways to reduce disease propagation is early diagnosis and isolating people infected with the virus. For this, mass testing is the need of the hour. At such a scale, it is critical to innovatively leverage existing infrastructure to build surge capacity and investigate low cost, high throughput methods.",

Despite RT-PCR being well established and widely available, many problems have emerged in actual performance, ranging from sub-optimal sensitivity, especially as the virus mutates, to low throughput due to many intermediate steps and long reaction times (Tahamtan and Ardebili 2020) . Additionally, specialized reagents are necessary for RT-PCR, which increases the cost of the test. Apart from this, rapid antigen tests are also being extensively used in various countries for preliminary screening. These tests are based on the detection of antigens from the nasopharyngeal swab using antibodies. A positive test confirms the presence of the virus, but a negative test is inconclusive since the sensitivity of the antigen test is between 34 and 80% (Bruning et al. 2017 ). Thus, a highly sensitive method is required to directly detect the virus from the nasopharyngeal swab to facilitate rapid screening. Mass spectrometer with high accuracy and sensitivity can be an ideal platform to identify viral peptides with medium to high throughput.",

For this, we initially analyzed samples in high-resolution mass spectrometer and identified eight unique and unmodified peptides from three proteins of SARS-CoV-2. These peptides were unique to SARS-CoV-2 and most importantly lay in the invariant region as revealed by analysis of more than 54,000 SARS-CoV-2 strains sequences submitted in GSAID up to 1st July 2020. This indicates that even if there are mutations in the virus, it should not affect the sequence of the peptides chosen. Using these peptides, we developed a short, 2.3 min, the gradient for the sMRM method and selected two peptides AIVSTIQRKYK from Replicase and QIAPGQTGK from Spike protein of SARS CoV-2 based on the consistency and quality of the spectra. Apart from these two peptides, we also included one peptide of human serum albumin AEFAEVSK as a control for protein amount. This was important since in a few samples we found that the intensities of albumin transitions were very low indicating low protein concentration and if the viral load is low in such samples it could result in false-negative results. These samples were thus not considered. Using this method we analyzed 103 naso-oropharyngeal samples in two sets. In the first set, we included 20 samples from 14 patients for which RT-PCR data of two or more time points was available. Interestingly, peptide peaks were detected in patients who recovered from the symptoms and were RT-PCR negative for SARS-CoV-2. Interestingly, peptide peaks were observed in two symptomatic patients who tested negative with RT-PCR of which one was tested positive in subsequent RT-PCR indicating false negative RT-PCR in the first instance. Thus, the data indicates high sensitivity of the current method and can be used for initial diagnosis including diagnosis of asymptomatic cases.",

For this, we considered healthy individuals with no exposure to SARS-CoV-2 virus as revealed by serology tests for antibodies against SARS-CoV-2and RT-PCR. These are the true controls since they neither have any active infection nor had been infected by the virus, previously. We considered a sample to be positive for SARS-CoV-2 if overlapping transitions were present with an intensity of greater than 1.5 \u00d7 10 3 and a signal to noise ratio of greater than 10 for either of the two selected peptides. This value was chosen since there will be residual peaks from carry-over of the previous sample and it was observed that the median values of the peaks in blank due to carry over were 2 \u00d7 10 2 -4.5 \u00d7 10 2 depending on the transition with a maximum intensity. Thus, to negate the carry-over effect we only considered peaks with intensity more than three times of this (1.5 \u00d7 10 3 ). Using this criterion; we could distinguish SARS-CoV-2 virus-infected individuals from uninfected ones with high specificity (100%) and sensitivity (90.4%) when compared with the RT-PCR. Out of the 63 RT-PCR positive samples, we reported 57 to be positive. Of the six samples that we did not confirm positive, three satisfied the criteria of at least three transitions in one peptide to be overlapping and having an intensity of greater than 1.5 \u00d7 103. However, the signal to noise ratio for one of the three transitions was not above 10. In one sample although the signal to noise ratio in three transitions were more than 10, the intensity of one of the transition was 1.42 \u00d7 103 which fell marginally short of our criteria. In the remaining two samples, more than one transition did not meet our criteria. It should be noted that the results of RT PCR could also be falsely positive in these cases.",

The swab samples can be directly collected in vials containing inactivation buffer ensuring safe transport and handling of the samples. The major advantage of our method is its short run time with a 2.3 min gradient which is the fastest reported till date for detection of SARS-CoV-2 peptides. Cardozo et al. (2020) reported a MRM with a gradient of 10.5 min that could detect SARS-CoV-2 peptides with a sensitivity of 83%. Interestingly, they used fully automated sample preparation protocol using robotic liquid handler and turbulent flow chromatography, multiplexed for online sample clean-up and UPLC separation that enabled them to run 4 samples within the 10.5 min run. However, this kind of setup will only be available in state-of-the-art laboratories and hence cannot be used for regular diagnostic purpose. In contrast, our method can be used in any laboratory equipped with a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer.",

We thus, propose that targeted mass spectrometry should currently be explored for screening and diagnostic purpose, which can augment the number of tests that are currently being carried out to detect SARS-CoV-2 and complement traditional RT-PCR based assays or act as an alternate and accurate diagnostic tool with high specificity and sensitivity.",
