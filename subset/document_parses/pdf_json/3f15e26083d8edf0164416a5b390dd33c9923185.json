            "text": "Over the past 20 months of the COVID-19 pandemic, a great deal has been crystallised about the ideal therapeutic targets for infected patients. For very sick patients who require hospitalisation, we now know that targeting the dysregulated host response is of greater value than targeting the virus. Through steroids, interleukin(IL)-6 blockade, IL-1 blockade, tyrosine kinase inhibition, or Janus kinase inhibition, we have a breadth of clinical trials that show the possible mortality benefits of both broad and focused immunomodulation in severely ill patients with COVID-19. As the pandemic continues, there is a need to understand whether combinations or different agents that target alternative pathways would continue to improve clinical outcomes, or whether there are ways of identifying specific patients with a higher likelihood of benefit from specific therapies.",

            "text": "One of the key components of the detrimental hyperinflammatory response in COVID-19 is granulocytemacrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), which is an immunomodulatory cytokine that might help to clear respiratory microbes by stimulating alveolar macrophages, but when in excess can cause damage. Its concentrations are low or undetectable in healthy individuals, yet many conditions can cause a rapid increase its concentration. 1 Increased circulating concentrations of GM-CSF have been described in patients with COVID-19 compared with healthy controls. 2 In the later stages of lung disease in COVID-19, excessive GM-CSF production can contribute to the dysregulated immune response in severe COVID-19, 3 in which, upstream of IL-1 and IL-6, activated T cells target neutrophils and macrophages. 4 Agents that interfere with its actions have high plausibility for benefit, not just in COVID-19, but in other acute inflammatory conditions, such as acute respiratory distress syndrome or sepsis. 5 In The Lancet Respiratory Medicine, Zelalem Temesgen and colleagues 6 report on a multicentre, placebocontrolled clinical trial of hospitalised patients with COVID-19, showing that lenzilumab, a neutralising monoclonal antibody against GM-CSF, is associated with improved survival without invasive mechanical ventilation at 28 days. Lenzilumab is a monoclonal antibody that directly binds GM-CSF and is being tested for conditions such as chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia and B-cell lymphoma.",

Patients in the lenzilumab group showed a 6% absolute increase in survival without ventilation at 28 days compared with the placebo group ( This study population had lower baseline C-reactive protein (CRP) concentrations than the cohorts in RECOVERY and REMAP-CAP-trials where IL-6-targeted therapy has shown the largest benefit. 7, 8 Exploratory sensitivity analyses suggested greater benefit of lenzilumab in patients with CRP concentrations less than the median value of 79 mg/L; further study of a CRP-guided approach, possibly targeting patients with lower CRP concentrations, earlier in their disease course, or of a different disease phenotype, could therefore be warranted. Whether biomarker-driven immunotherapy with stratification of patients can guide individualised use of immunomodulatory treatments in COVID-19 needs to be explored.",

This trial, which enrolled patients between May, 2020, and January, 2021, did not allow administration of other immunomodulators, such as tocilizumab or baricitinib, during the acute stay, and was done before these medications became more routinely used in clinical practice. Without knowledge of the added benefit or the added risk of different, concurrently used immunomodulators, trials that do not integrate available standards of care are difficult to interpret. Hence, the specific value of GM-CSF blockade, in the absence of comparative or additive data with other targeted immunomodulators, is impossible to evaluate. As treatment regimens for COVID-19 constantly change and become more complex, evaluation of interactions must be the goal, and probably requires coordination across clinical trials, industry sponsors, and the involvement of large platform trials.",

This difference on the outcome of survival without ventilation was primarily driven by more patients in the placebo group requiring invasive ventilation (49 [20%] patients) than those in the lenzilumab group (26 [11%] patients; HR 0\u00b752 [0\u00b732-0\u00b782], p=0\u00b70059).
