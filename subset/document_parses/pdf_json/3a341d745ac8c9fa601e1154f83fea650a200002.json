This study aims to estimate the impact of IT exports, gross capital formation, FDI, and trade openness on sustainable economic growth with regional integration of BRI countries using the annual panel data from 2013 to 2018. Moderating variable is regional integration, while the trade freedom index, investment freedom index, real interest rate, and inflation are control variables. The two-step system GMM technique is applied to the sample as the number of moment conditions is greater than the number of parameters. The results suggest that FDI and gross capital formation have a substantial positive impact on economic growth, whereas IT exports and trade openness have a negative, insignificant impact. The overall results suggest that China's outward FDI has boosted the economic growth in countries while trade openness has a negligible since most developing countries need to invest in industrialization and encourage exports based growth.",

The outcomes suggested that the FDI and trade openness have an optimistic effect on long tenure economic growth. The researchers found that there is a long-run relationship from both the actual exchange rate and gross capital formation to economic growth. The outcomes revealed that there is bidirectional interconnection from FDI to economic growth, trade openness to FDI, and unidirectional interconnection from trade openness to FDI [21] .",

We have contemplated various logical factors was utilized to dissect the sustainable economic development of these nations exclusively. However, according to our knowledge, there has been no analysis on the effect of these factors on sustainable economic development considering all BRI nations simultaneously. The motive for considering all the BRI nation-states is that before the BRI initiative, these states were facing challenges in heaving FDI, IT exports, and gross capital formation empowering streamlined commerce relations and integrating the financial relations. Due to these issues, there was an increased poverty rate and unemployment in these nations; however, this activity has helped the nations to come together and make long haul exchange relations in order to increase jobs and new business ventures. The existing literature provided mixed results when the economic growth through various variables was examined. This study considered the findings of all the above-mentioned studies. In this study, we have applied two-step system GMM technique with untapped set variables due to its robustness and efficiency, and it provides more accurate results when the number of individuals is greater than the time of the dataset. Although this study also gave mixed results, it explains that most of the partner countries in BRI are developing and they must focus to attain economic stability and enhance the growth objectives. Study contribute that the developing countries must provide an atmosphere to the investors to attract foreign direct investment and also focus on increasing the gross capital formation to improve the country's outlook. Moreover, developing countries need to adopt technology advancement and increase the use of information technology. The developed countries are far ahead in this area, and hence, developed countries have the edge on information technology exports, whereas due to less focus on information technology, poor countries are disadvantaged in terms of IT exports. Moreover, developed countries are flourishing because of the concept of industrialization with strong exchange rates; however, developing countries have weak industry and they find it difficult to compete in the competitive environment.",

When there is a connection between the explanatory variable and the error term in a model, GMM is a robust panel data estimator that checks for the endogeneity of the lagged dependent variable in a vibrant panel model. The two-step GMM is improved as it checks for misplaced variables bias, undetected panel heterogeneity, and measurement errors. It is more effective and vigorous to heteroscedasticity and autocorrelation [26] . When the distribution of the dependent variable is unknown, the two-step system GMM is considered as the reliable technique to use. To make GMM a dynamic model and to address the factor of autocorrelation in the static regression model, the lag-value of economic growth is considered. Hence, by adjusting the lag-effect of its dependent variable that is economic growth in the long term to forecast the future more precisely, GMM is preferred [27] .",

GMM first controls autocorrelation, then differentiates and analyses the outcomes of a research panel dataset more efficiently.

            "text": "Correlation analysis in Table 2 depicts the movement of variables and the relationship between different variables. The correlation value varies from 1 to 0 to -1. If the correlation value is positive and close to one, it means that the two variables are positively correlated and are similar to each other, whereas if the correlation value is negative and close to -1, it shows that the two variables are negatively correlated and are different to each other. The very positively correlated variables have an overall negative impact on the results because there is a factor of multicollinearity that both variables are similar and one variable should be removed from the dataset to get more accurate and reliable results. As per the correlation matrix, we can see that all the variables are correlated with each other, and no value indicates the factor of multicollinearity since the value of the threshold is less than 80% [33] . The correlation matrix shows that the FDI, gross capital formation, and inflation are positively correlated with economic growth at a significant level of 1%, while trade openness, IT exports, trade freedom index, investment freedom index, and real interest rate are perfectly negatively correlated with economic growth. The detailed results are demonstrated below in Table 2. 3.3. Results of direct channel: two-step system GMM During the association of explanatory variable and the error term in a model, the two-step system GMM checks for the endogeneity of the lagged dependent variable in a vibrant panel model. Two-step system Table 3 show that two-step GMM technique is the most reliable and effective approach to analyze the results. It can be seen that the constant value is higher from explanatory variables and its impact cannot be ignored. Therefore, system GMM is a better technique shown in column 5 than fixed-effect or pooled OLS techniques. Hence, the results of economic growth confirm the dynamic nature of the model positively at a significance level of 1%. Moreover, the results also suggest that on average ceteris paribus, a percentage change in FDI is associated with coefficient value [0.081] increase in economic growth at the 1% significance level. Hence, FDI and economic growth exhibit an elastic relationship. Therefore, the outcomes validate the first alternate hypothesis (H1) of a significant positive relationship between FDI and economic growth.",

The results validate the statement that China's outward FDI has greatly helped the developing countries in attaining the goal of economic growth, and ultimately, countries have increased their gross capital formation to attain the objective of economic growth. The trade openness and IT exports variables have a negative impact because the developing countries face a challenge in maintaining the exchange rate, the balance of payments, and current accounts balance. Moreover, due to low investments in the IT sector, developing countries are less advantaged with respect to IT exports as compared to developed countries.

Further, correlation matrix results revealed that there is no multicollinearity found in the data and the relationship between variables is normal. Further, results are based on the two-step system GMM technique. Another uniqueness of this research paper is that we have considered 64 BRI countries based on the data availability for a maximum number of years for the partner countries, and the analyses show that the FDI and gross capital formation has a significant positive impact on the economic growth of BRI countries, whereas trade openness and information technology exports have a negatively insignificant impact on BRI countries. The findings of the first hypothesis FDI and economic growth are in line with the of the studies of [36] who conducted a study in the context of Saudi Arabia [25] , who researched on the context of Turkey, and with [37] who researched in the context of MENA countries.

Therefore, our findings endorse the null hypothesis (H3).
