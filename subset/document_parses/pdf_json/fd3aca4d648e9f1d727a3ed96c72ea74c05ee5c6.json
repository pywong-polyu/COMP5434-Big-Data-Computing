Five client cases (15%) were hospitalized, two died (6%). Sequencing yielded the same specific B.1.1.519 genotype in all three facilities. No significant difference in median viral load was established comparing the B.1.1.519 variant with other circulating variants. The index of the linked outbreak reported no travel history or link to suspected or confirmed cases suggesting regional surveillance. Observed peak regional prevalence of B.1.1.519 during the outbreak supports this.",

Little information is available on the B.1.1.519 variant with spike mutation T478K which became dominant in Mexico over the course of a few months: in October 2020, 5% of sequenced specimens were reported to be B.1.1.519, whereas in February 2021, this percentage had increased to 87% [10] . Spike mutation T478K lies within the interaction domain with the human receptor ACE2 [11] . Additionally, B.1.1.519 shares the P681H mutation with the B.1.1.7 variant, which is near the furin-cleavage site and could have an effect on viral entry [12] .",

The linked outbreak featured a high attack rate among clients in one facility, a large proportion of asymptomatic infections, and a high case hospitalization and mortality rate. To our knowledge, this is the first report of an outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 variant B.1.1.519 in facilities for individuals with IDD. The attack rate of 92% among clients in outbreak 1 was very high. An earlier study (publication forthcoming) conducted by South Limburg Public Health Service in residential care facilities for people with IDD describes multiple barriers in infection prevention and control. At an individual level, a high prevalence of behavioral problems, difficulties in teaching and instructing clients, lack of hygiene awareness and low risk perception may play an important role. Low health awareness in clients may hamper self-monitoring and self-reporting, especially with regard to subjective or subtle symptoms like anosmia or sore throat. Reluctance in reporting symptoms for fear of subsequent quarantine or isolation measures may also play a role [17] . Shared meals and shared living rooms of clients further facilitate transmission. Additionally, care workers in these facilities sometimes Results from both studies and other relevant sources show that effective infection control in these settings is challenging [7] . Asymptomatic and mild symptomatic infections play an important role in Covid-19 transmission and may have facilitated spread among clients and staff members in outbreak 1 [18] . The high viral load, corresponding to an unusually low Ct value, observed in one client who was pre-symptomatic at the time of testing may have facilitated rapid transmission. We determined that 55% of clients were asymptomatic compared to 25% in staff members, lending further weight to our claim that people with IDD underreport symptoms.",

Super-spreading events may be a prerequisite factor in promoting widespread circulation (next to intrinsic viral transmissibility) and permanence of a novel variant in a population [19] . While B.1.1.519 did not gain a significant foothold in the Netherlands, outbreaks in residential care facilities may act as potential super-spreaders for new variants, given the specific vulnerable population of patients with IDD, the high AR, the high viral load in one case, and clients from different facilities visiting the same daycare facilities. Outbreak 3 may serve to illustrate that widespread intramural transmission can quickly be halted if rigorous infection control measures are implemented at the earliest possible stage. Our findings argue for enhanced surveillance and infection prevention and control in these settings. Likewise, institutionalized individuals with IDD should be eligible for prioritized vaccination against COVID-19. This is also underlined by the high case fatality and hospitalization rate observed in our study. Multiple studies report intellectual disability to be a strong independent risk factor for developing COVID-19, hospitalization and mortality due to COVID-19 [4, 5] . Being diagnosed with Down syndrome in particular carries increased mortality [20] .",

Its closest ancestor is an isolate from the Auvergne-Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes region in France, collected on February 9, featuring two mutations less than the majority of isolates in this study.",

Due to its retrospective character findings regarding signs and symptoms of disease and days of onset may have been affected by response bias and recall bias which could have played a role in data collection. However, most data was extracted from patient files, based on observations by staff members. In outbreak 2 not all clients were included in the second round of group testing possibly leading to an underestimation of the AR. Lastly, in asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic cases the date of the positive test was used as a proxy for disease onset which may have influenced the chronological reconstruction of the outbreak.",

However, the B.1.1.7 variant rapidly became the dominant variant in the Netherlands, rising from 7% prevalence in early January 2021 to more than 90% by April, based on national surveillance by the National Institute for Public Health & the Environment [9]. Similar rapid rise in prevalence was observed in the South-Limburg region. The rapid surge of B.1.1.7 in the Netherlands and elsewhere, compared to a slower rise of B.1.1.519 in Mexico, may suggest that intrinsic transmissibility of B.1.1.519 is less outspoken, arguing in favor of our hypothesis that factors specific to facilities for patients with IDD played a decisive role in this outbreak. This is further supported by our study in which the B.1.1.7 variant, but not B.1.1.519 showed a significantly lower median Ct value compared to other variants.",
