Hospital managers, by failing to recognize their own role in supporting patient safety, may actually hinder patient safety and error reporting. This includes concerns with the effectiveness of handover of patients between staff members at crucial times (Richter et al., 2016) .

Furthermore it has also been suggested that the patient safety culture of an institution refers to \"the way we do things around here\", and that culture is a confined singularity, referring in particular to a work unit (Pronovost & Sexton, 2005) . Combining these concepts, patient safety culture has been defined as \"a set of values attitudes, perceptions, beliefs, and behaviours that support the safe conduct of individuals' activities in health organizations\" (Khoshakhlagh et al., 2019) . Other authors have also emphasized that the physical environment within an institution plays a role in patient safety as well (Joseph et al., 2012) .",

We see exactly the same situation when it comes to pharmacovigilance activities in hospitals in South Africa and wider, and the need to instigate a culture of reporting and learning (Katusiime et al., 2015; Shamim et al., 2016; Terblanche et al., 2017) .

They can play an important role in maintaining the quality of care to patients, with managerial attitudes playing an important role in the development of a mature safety culture within hospitals (Pierre, 2013) . The patient safety culture of an organization is usually established by the senior management and executives within hospitals, with managers potentially incentivized to promote a just and positive patient safety culture within their institutions. This is illustrated in the USA where from 2008, Medicare has stopped paying hospitals for errors deemed preventable with hospitals becoming liable for any payments that arise from errors including additional procedures or extended hospital stays (Brooks, 2007) . Similarly in South Africa, the National Department of Health (NDoH) has certain policies and guidelines that inform best practices across the spectrum of healthcare providers. These include the NDoH (2007) recommending interventions focussed on improving care by healthcare professionals, such as continuing professional development, the use of structured encounter forms such as prenatal care forms, and providing feedback to clinicians regarding their performance as means to improve upon quality of care.",

Consequently, there are financial implications and incentives for healthcare institutions in South Africa to successfully implement patient safety initiatives. Other initiatives to generally enhance the quality of and efficiency of care in hospitals including establishing and strengthening the role for Pharmaceutical and Therapeutics Committees (PTCs) within hospitals to improve the monitoring of medicines and reduce errors (Mashaba et al., 2019; Matlala et al., 2020; Meyer et al., 2017) . This is important when the provision of care to patients is unsafe, and in worst case scenarios, causes them harm. This can lead to costly litigation against healthcare providers or the hospital as a whole (Sohn, 2013) . In the Gauteng Province of South Africa, more than 20,000 patients have been harmed in hospitals over a period of two and a half years from January 2016 to June 2018 .

The Director of Clinical services as well as managers and operational managers from these departments were purposively recruited to reflect the diverse views relevant to this hospital and its context.

The protection from harm encompasses both physical harm and security for patients, the quality of care provided to patients and the attitudes of staff towards patients. Participants also understood patient safety culture as adherence to the standards set by the NDoH. A common theme that emerged during this stage of the interviews was that for a positive culture to exist, all staff and the hospital as a whole have to be proactive about patient safety, rather than reactive: \u2026 when an event takes place that's related to patient safety, it's always reactive, across the board, whatever kind of patient safety, it's reactive, write reports and people perceive it as punitive, that something is going to happen that's going to be negative.

            "text": "Participants highlighted the various challenges faced by the hospital in ensuring patient safety. These included the issues of currently weak infrastructure, negative staff attitudes, lack of patient safety guideline implementation and a culture of not always reporting adverse events. Physical security and the physical environment have been shown to be important for patient comfort, patient safety and for establishing a conducive working environment for staff (Rashid, 2007) ; and concerns need to be addressed to improve future patient care. World Health, Organization & World Alliance for Patient Safety Research Priority Setting Working Group (2008) points out that a consequence of poorly maintained infrastructure and equipment in hospitals, especially in developing countries, is a higher incidence of adverse events, which must be avoided in the future (World Health, Organization & World Alliance for Patient Safety Research Priority Setting Working Group, 2008) . The importance of a proper infrastructure for patient safety was also pointed out by the researchers (Urlich et al., 2004) who found that an optimal physical environment reduces staff stress and fatigue, improves patient safety and improves the overall quality of healthcare provided. Hrickiewicz (2015) also underscored the vital contribution that a hospital's building infrastructure including technology and engineering infrastructures provides to the provision of quality care and patient safety. Poor infrastructure including the physical environment and human resources affects staff performance leading to human error, which in turn leads to adverse events that are essentially preventable. In terms of infrastructure, participants reported that encouragingly the hospital does have measures in place to ensure physical security of staff and patients alike, which is encouraging. The presence of security guards, CCTV cameras, and restricted access to certain areas, bears testimony to these efforts. However, there are an appreciable number of infrastructural issues in this hospital that hinder the establishment of a positive patient safety culture. These include the poor condition of the hospital building, lack of generators and poor water supply. These are similar to the findings in two hospitals in East Africa where the physical environment as well as a lack of equipment and supplies were seen to negatively affect healthcare workers' ability to provide quality and safe care to patients (Aveling et al., 2015) . In addition, participants lamented the lack of proper ventilation and inadequate isolation rooms, both of which have been identified as effective measures preventing the spread of hospital acquired infections, which can appreciably impact on morbidity, mortality and costs (Manoukian et al., 2018; Murni et al., 2015; Perovic et al., 2020; Urlich et al., 2004) . Proper hand-hygiene is a critical standard for infection control in all hospitals (Allegranzi & Pittet, 2009; Ara et al., 2019) , and the lack of water supply was hypothesized by one participant to be the cause of an infection outbreak in the wards. This needs to be addressed and is even more important with the recent COVID-19 pandemic, especially given concerns with high levels of antimicrobial prescribing in hospitals of patients with COVID-19 despite limited bacterial and fungal infections (Langford et al., 2021 (Langford et al., , 2020 . High prescribing rates will accelerate antimicrobial resistance unless addressed (Godman et al., 2021; Hsu, 2020) .",

Poor retention of staff, particular nurses, was highlighted as an area of concern by many of our respondents, with high turnover rates also seen in other studies (Stone et al., 2008) . Aveling et al. (2015) also found similar results in East Africa, with Urlich et al. (2004) acknowledging that high clinician turnover rates result in overworked staff, burnout and potentially adverse events, with Carayon and Gurses (2008) pointing out that high patient numbers per healthcare professionals can have a negative impact on subsequent provision of care and patient outcomes. When this occurs, patients in our study often complained via the Quality Department of the hospital and if no redress could be reached within internal processes litigation ensued. Complaints from patients or their families often relate to the attitudes of staff towards them including not caring as well as lacking empathy and lack professionalism, similar to other studies (Kroening et al., 2015; Van De Ven, 2014) . Galloway (2011) describes the concept of \"dignity in care\" which encompasses promoting dignity and sensitivity into clinical practice to provide safer care. This concept encompasses healthcare professionals affording respect for patients as they would expect for themselves or for their relatives, with attitudes and behaviours of staff significantly affecting dignity in care. Our recommendation based on the published literature and feedback from participants is for the hospital to invest in both infrastructure and human resources to provide safe and high quality care in line with published advice (Pronovost et al., 2008) . In addition, encourage staff members to put themselves in the shoes of the patient and to treat them as they would treat their own relatives. We will be following this up in future research projects.",

In view of this, we suggest this hospital focuses initially on patient safety practices that are easier to implement and that are evidence-based. This includes implementing strategies to address the current culture that results in poor levels of reporting of adverse events. We have seen similar poor levels of reporting of adverse events from medicines across South Africa prior to instigating initiatives to address this (Dheda et al., 2016; Joubert & Naidoo, 2016; Terblanche et al., 2017 Terblanche et al., , 2018 . The importance of reporting adverse events was emphasized by participants who recognized it as a form of organizational learning, where quality improvement could be a result of improved reporting systems. However, this may be hampered by a culture of \"blame and shame\" that currently pervades among staff in the hospital, and that reporting adverse events held a punitive connotation for staff mirroring the findings in other studies (Heard et al., 2012) . The current response to adverse events in the hospital was seen as predominantly reactive in nature. However encouragingly, the general consensus from participants was that the hospital was trying hard to improve the situation and improve patient care; however, many gaps still remain suggesting key areas for improvement.",

Reporting all errors (including near-misses) that occur has the prospective benefit of strengthening the care process and improving the quality of care provided to patients (Hughes, 2008) , which should be borne in mind going forward Participants also lamented the lack of feedback from reported incidents. However, this is changing with participants in certain units holding weekly mortality and morbidity meetings, during which incident reports or adverse events are discussed as a means to learn from the error and improve on service delivery. This mirrors the findings of Hor et al. (2010) , who suggested mortality and morbidity meetings provide a platform for feedback to the units regarding the events that have taken place and discuss ways forward. Consequently, suggestions for this hospital going forward also include regular feedback meetings discussing adverse event reports and incidents to improve future care. Common adverse events in this hospital include patient falls, missing patients, misidentification of patients, adverse events due to drug treatment, poor infection control practices, pressure sores, unsafe blood products, maternal and new-born safety and mortality due to anaesthetic error, similar to the adverse events reported by De Vries et al. (2008) . Overall, adverse incidents in developing countries are estimated to be of greater concern than those seen in developed countries due to a lack of resources and lack of implementation of positive patient safety practices (World Health Organization & World Alliance for Patient Safety Research Priority Setting Working Group, 2008), which need addressing going forward.",

The overarching theme to improving the patient safety culture is that this is one of the main responsibilities of the hospital, and within this framework, each ward and each healthcare professional needs to adopt patient safety as a priority. Sammer et al. (2010) suggested that an ideal organizational patient safety culture comprises seven subcultures, namely (a) leadership; (b) teamwork; (c) evidence-based; (d) communication; (e) learning; (f) just; and (g) patient-centred. It was a concern in this hospital that despite most of the study participants being part of senior management, there was no mention of the role that leadership plays in cultivating a positive patient safety culture. If senior management is not investing appropriately in a patient safety culture, there is concern that this will not filter down. Communication as a foundation of a positive patient safety culture was also not discussed by the participants in our study, which is a concern for the future This is another core issue relating to patient safety and the lack of input on this topic from participants may be indicative of the current culture that exists, which needs to be urgently addressed. Improving the reporting of adverse events could facilitate the organization in learning from this experience and subsequently using the lessons learnt to develop future quality improvement plans promoting a culture of learning. A just culture is one where the reporting of adverse events is seen as a non-punitive process.",

In addition, reducing the utilization of public health services such as HIV testing as well as clinics for patients with non-communicable diseases (NCDs) (Burger & Mchenga, 2021; Ogunleye et al., 2020; Pillay et al., 2021) . Services for patients with NCDs including diabetes are increasingly important in South Africa and across Africa given rising prevalence rates, with management adversely affected by lockdown and other measures Kluge et al., 2020) . The pandemic has also increased daily costs for hospitalized patients (Edoka et al., 2021) . The burden on the South African healthcare system is further confounded by the recent emergence of the Omicron variant, being more transmissible and partially resistant to existing vaccines (Torjesen, 2021) . Healthcare resources and manpower are increasingly being diverted towards COVID-19 relief efforts, thus timely and effective efforts to improve patient safety in this setting are imperative, both during the pandemic and beyond.",
