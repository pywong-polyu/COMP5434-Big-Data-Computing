            "text": "Possessiveness toward objects and sharing are competing tendencies that influence dyadic and group interactions within the primate lineage. A distinctive form of sharing in adult Homo sapiens involves active giving of high-valued possessions to others, without an immediate reciprocal benefit. In two Experiments with 19-month-old human infants (N = 96), we found that despite measurable possessive behavior toward their own personal objects (favorite toy, bottle), infants spontaneously gave these items to a begging stranger. Moreover, human infants exhibited this behavior across different types of objects that are relevant to theory (personal objects, sweet food, and common objects)-showing flexible generalizability not evidenced in non-human primates. We combined these data with a previous dataset, yielding a large sample of infants (N = 192), and identified sociocultural factors that may calibrate young infants' sharing of objects with others. The current findings show a proclivity that is rare or absent in our closest living relatives-the capacity to override possessive behavior toward personally valued objects by sharing those same desired objects with others.",

Human adults are notable for their possessiveness and also for sharing items with non-kin strangers. There are considerable individual differences, with some people displaying hoarding of objects and limited sharing 7-9 . Others display little possessiveness and readily share things that belong to them, even items of significant value 10,11 . There are also cultural differences in the balance between the tendency for possessiveness versus sharing in humans 12,13 .

            "text": "What about human infants? Studies on language development provide a starting point: Many infants produce possessive language (e.g., \"mine\" or \"yours\") and act possessively toward specific items by 18 months of age 15 -an ability that is evident in most infants by about 24 months of age 16, 17 . Weighing against this possessiveness, infants also act prosocially and selectively share objects with adults under certain conditions [18] [19] [20] [21] . This was demonstrated experimentally in a pioneering laboratory study designed to test infants and chimpanzees (18 and 36-54 months old, respectively) 22 . In one task used in this study, an adult showed the infant that he was trying to hang towels, but the clothespin slipped from the adult's hand, and the behavioral measure was whether the infant would hand the clothespin back to the adult. Using variants of this accidental-dropping paradigm, researchers have reported that infants help or actively share a variety of common objects with both kin and non-kin strangers 23-25 , whether there is explicit reward or not 26 , and with both familiar and unfamiliar items 27,28 .",

A follow-up study with 16-to 36-month-olds replicated this multistep procedure in the context of providing the parents with items for use at home and then testing the children a week later; results showed that children sometimes gave the object following prompts such as \"Can you give me the scarf?\" 30 .

This flexible sharing of valued personal objects with strangers, even in cases without reciprocity, has been understudied in infants. In light of this gap, we sought a non-verbal procedure that could be used to measure both infant possessiveness and sharing in the same setting, and which might be adaptable for use with non-human primates to inform comparative and developmental psychology questions about commonalities/distinctiveness in \"sociality profiles\" among human adults, human infants, and non-human primates [35] [36] [37] [38] . What type of objects do human infants value to such an extent that we could evaluate their overriding wanting-for-the-self in favor of prosocial sharing? There is a particular class of things that human infants seek out as highly valued. This class has often been dubbed \"attachment\" 39 , \"transition\" 40 , or \"contact comfort\" 41 objects. Common exemplars are their own stuffed teddy bear or blanket. In naturalistic observations, it has been noted that infants often lean/lunge towards or try to possessively grab these treasured objects 39 .",

The accidental-drop procedure we adopted was designed to exclude linguistic prompts (such prompts make comparisons with non-human primates difficult), exclude immediate reciprocity by the adult, and to provide infants with an escape route which made it easy for them to grab their high-value object and retreat to their parent, rather than to share with the experimenter. Experiment 1 provided an initial test; Experiment 2 used a range of objects of different value to the infants, examined infants' responses to these objects, and introduced a measure of infant possessive behavior. Finally, we combine across the experiments and explore the malleability of human infant sharing. We report a capacity for sharing personally valued items that is simultaneously present in human infancy and also influenced by the infants' own sociocultural experiences.",

In the Experimental group, an experimenter sitting across the table from the infant fumbled the objects such that they seemed to accidentally fall from his hand, landing out of his reach on the floor on the infant's side of the table. The experimenter unsuccessfully reached for the fallen object but was blocked by the table. A fixed, 20-s response period was electronically timed, during which the experimenter exhibited a pleasant but neutral facial expression independent of infants' actions. During this period there were no linguistic instructions provided to infants (see Methods). Thus, infants did not receive multistep linguistic requests for assistance as is sometimes the case in related studies in the human infant literature 29, 30 (Supplementary Information).",

We were able to index value by introducing non-verbal measures of the desire for the objects tested, which involved measurements of infant lunging toward them and reaching out with their hands when the experimenter first showed them to the ) . Previous studies using objects in infant object sharing paradigms have not had assessments of how much infants wanted the objects in the experiment and therefore the balance between self-wanting and sharing with another person was not assessed. Second, Experiment 2 takes on importance because active sharing by human adults is flexible and generalizes across types of objects. While adults actively give a range of objects to non-kin, the sociality profile of non-human primates is such that chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) tend to give common objects to others, but not food 22 , and bonobos (Pan paniscus) tend to give food and not common objects 14, 36 . We assessed the flexibility of human infants, employing a repeated-measures design with the same infants tested on six items (two personal objects, two food objects, and two common objects). We examined both whether infants showed elevated signs of possessiveness toward their own personal objects versus the other objects tested and the degree to which infants actively give different types of objects (which would assess the flexibility demonstrated by adults and not typically observed in non-human primates).",

The number of infants who exhibited such possessive behavior was evenly distributed between the Experimental (31 infants) and Control (31 infants) groups, as expected by chance and random assignment. We analyzed whether infants who showed possessive behavior toward a personal object (dichotomous yes/no) went on to give the adult that same object.

We designed the experiments in specific ways that could have tempted the infant to selfishly seize the valuable objects for themselves. That is, the room was arranged such that the experimenter was seated behind a table when presenting the objects, and the infant was on the other side of the table at a short distance from their parent. In order to take his seat at the table the experimenter had to open and close a gate, and once in place he did not have direct spatial access to the infant (see Methods). This arrangement was used so that the infants could pick up their objects and easily escape directly to their parent instead of giving up their objects to the stranger.

Based on the extant literature [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] 14, 36 , we suggest that other non-human primate species are unlikely to succeed across a range of objects (personal objects for which they have demonstrated possessiveness, desirable food, common objects), particularly in the absence of immediate reciprocity and the presence of an escape route allowing subjects to grab the objects and keep them for themselves. The flexible expression of this sharing of personally valued items may be distinctively human. Yet, it is manifest in human infants by 19 months of age.",

It is possible that in the experimental group, after the adult accidentally drops the object, the adult's begging gesture could have been interpreted as a command to return the desirable object to him, and thus the act of picking up and giving the objects could be motivated by obedience or docility, rather than prosocial sharing. Yet, compliance with social norms is itself a type of prosociality 51 . The potential distinction between sharing versus compliance (or obedience) may be challenging to measure in nonverbal infants and other primates. Nonetheless, it is of interest to theory 6 , and some research has begun to examine infants' representations of obedience 52, 53 . Future research might attempt to design studies to explore how finely-differentiated infants' representations might be with respect to prosocial sharing, compliance, and/or obedience to tease out the specific motives for the observed infant giving behavior.",

While our coding of possessiveness introduced a measurement of the non-verbal desire to possess objects, this did not tap infants' neural processing of the events as they unfolded 54 , nor infants' emotional reactions. We do not know if infants weighed the value of the object during the moment of giving, but we know that infants showed possessive behavior, sometimes lunging toward their personal objects when they saw them. It would be interesting to examine whether giving away a treasured toy induced a cost 28, 55 , particularly an affective, \"emotional cost\" that may have been undetectable by our behavioral coding. Future research, perhaps using infant emotional expressions, pupil dilation 56 , physiological assessments (e.g., heart rate 57 ), or brain measures might be able to detect whether infants experience a greater emotional cost in sharing their personal objects than they do sharing common objects (despite similar performance on our behavioral measure). Also of interest is whether infants in our study might have experienced a self-rewarding positive emotion after acting in a generous, sharing fashion, characterized as feeling of \"warm glow\" in adults and older toddlers 58, 59 . As such, it remains to be investigated how infants affectively, neurally, and cognitively process situations in which they give away their own items-which they may desire to possess-to non-kin strangers.",

In the U.S. context, different cultural groups have measurably different socialization values and practices 72, 73 , and while we cannot specify which particular family value may be at play here, we can offer several possibilities. , and research has shown that East Asian children are motivated to adopt parental cultural customs and norms 45, 74 . Relatedly, from a young age, U.S.-based Hispanic/Latino children are exposed such cultural values as acomedido (to be attentive to others' needs and help without being asked) 75 and simp\u00e1tia (to be gregarious and hospitable) 76 . In interactions with toddlers, Mexican immigrant mothers emphasize the tendency toward positive demeanor 77 . Furthermore, Hispanic/Latino and Asian children may be socialized to value the needs or wants of others and/or to put less value on retention of objects solely for oneself. A fundamental question for theories in developmental science is how variations in parental values and practices influence their children. In older children, this may largely be driven by linguistic communication and explicit verbal teaching about values and identity [78] [79] [80] . In infants, we speculate that observational social learning plays a dominant role. Parental values \"leak out\" through their behavior. These behaviors are experienced firsthand by infants when parents engage with them 5,81 , and they can be learned through observation when infants see their parents interact with others. Research on imitation shows that infants watch, remember, and re-enact behaviors they see others perform 37 ; infants also have the capacity to draw more abstract inferences about agents' goals, dispositions, affiliations, and social evaluations, which cause infants to act in congruence [82] [83] [84] [85] [86] [87] [88] . As such, observational social learning may be a key mechanism by which parental life experiences, values, goals, and practices [89] [90] [91] influence early prosocial tendencies. Because parental life experiences, values, goals, and practices differ across sociocultural groups, infants' observational learning skills could help explain the sociocultural effects we observed in our experiments.",

Yet, some infants override this in favor of sharing by giving away treasured possessions as well as other categories of things. Infants did so in the absence of explicit rewards or immediate reciprocity by the non-kin stranger, despite having the desirable objects in their own hands and an immediate way for retaining possession. Interestingly, the expression of such behavior is related to sociocultural variables, suggesting that experiential factors may serve to calibrate the balance between possessive impulses and sharing behaviors during human infancy. The social-cognitive capacities that humans have in common with non-human primates, when coupled with rearing practices among human caregivers, may provide social learning experiences that enable infants to develop the uniquely Homo sapiens prosocial profile exhibited by adults.",

The coders were unaware of the experimental hypotheses. During the response period for each trial, the behavior scored was the presence or absence of infant giving, i.e., whether or not the infant placed the object on the experimenter's hand. During the demonstration period for each trial, the coder scored the presence or absence of each of three types of possessive behaviors, i.e., whether infants: (1) prepared to grasp the object with one hand extended toward object with hand shaping/alignment, (2) demonstrated an approach effort toward the object by rising onto the balls of the feet (both heels off floor) to lean or lunge toward the object, (3) raised both arms toward the goal object. The demonstration period was defined as the interval between when the experimenter first showed the object (experimenter's hand brought the object up from below the table edge) to his relinquishment of the object from his hand (so that it dropped to the tray on floor).
