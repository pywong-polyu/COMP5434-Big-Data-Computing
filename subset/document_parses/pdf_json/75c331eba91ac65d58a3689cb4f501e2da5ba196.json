These data trends broadly shadow the reports from the community at large in the second wave as they did in the first wave, and are likely underestimates [2] . The proportion of these reports attributed to health and social work activities was 78% in the first wave of reporting (until August) and therefore higher than the 55% in the second wave (from September). Conversely, education and manufacturing combined accounted for less than 2% of all first wave reports, but around 15% of all second wave reports. This has been attributed in part to the re-opening of the general economy in July [1] .",

            "text": "The greatest concern in primary prevention of covid-19 at work has probably been the persisting underestimation of the risk of airborne spread and hence the inadequacy of precautionary protection, in spite of past lessons. Lessons had been learnt from other viral epidemics and outbreaks. SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and now SARS-CoV-2 are all betacoronaviruses. The spread of SARS (SARS-CoV) in Hong Kong in 2002/03 raised significant concern due to the high fatality rate and its potential for onward transmission. While initially there were failings in the management of SARS-CoV in hospital settings it was learned during that time that besides patients being isolated, healthcare workers (HCW) had to be provided with filtering face piece (FFP) respirators as minimum respiratory protective equipment (RPE). Although SARS-CoV did not exhibit as significant a level of community transmission as covid-19 (caused by SARS-CoV-2), guidance based on evidence and consensus and co-authored by Professor Jonathan Van-Tam (Deputy Chief Medical Officer) recognized that transmission of SARS coronavirus was by 'droplet/aerosol' [3] . Moreover, that guidance prescribed FFP3 respirators (rather than merely a surgical face mask) as RPE for HCW. Furthermore, this best practice guideline was explicitly not limited to so-called aerosol-generating procedures (AGP) [3] . The MERS-CoV outbreak in South Korea in 2015 was predominantly nosocomially spread from infected patients to HCW and other inpatients with very limited onward community transmission [4] . Nevertheless, Public Health England (PHE) guidance on personal protective equipment (PPE) for HCW caring for patients with MERS-CoV included the use of FFP respirators as well as full gowns [5] . Since betacoronaviruses in both those epidemics which had much more limited community transmission than covid-19 had a recognized potential to spread readily nosocomially, this should have suggested that a virus as infectious as SARS-CoV-2 would do so even more readily. Therefore appropriate precautions against airborne transmission at least as stringent as for those earlier betacoronavirus epidemics (therefore including FFP as PPE for all HCW) should have been warranted for protection against SARS-CoV-2.",

Research commissioned by the HSE long before the pandemic and showing the overwhelming superiority of FFPs over surgical face masks in protecting against viral aerosols was not acted upon [7] . The HSE's extant guidance before the pandemic recommending FFPs as minimum protection against biological agents seems to remain tacitly eschewed [8] in spite of calls to apply precautionary principles [8, 9] in PPE especially in respect of HCWs.",

Regrettably, the pandemic has also reminded us of lessons and guidance which were overlooked and sidelined and likely resulted in workers' ill-health and deaths which might have been prevented. The abandonment of a UK objective to eradicate the virus and the restriction of the vaccination programme to adults may lead the pandemic to subside into an endemic infection for years. This may carry the risk of variants with different clinical features or reduced protection by current vaccines. Therefore, vigilance, protection and preparedness for such eventualities remain essential. Workplaces, especially in the NHS, must strengthen their capacity to test, (geno)type, (back)track and trace. Occupational health services and hygiene measures including barriers, ventilation and higher grade PPE will continue to be needed on a much greater scale than before the onset of the pandemic. In light of the risk of future pandemics it is imperative that healthcare facilities are reviewed in due course and upgraded to have self-contained areas for the isolation of cases where optimum ventilatory support can be provided, and with the ability to rapidly expand these areas as required to assist with outbreak control without compromising the safety of staff.",
