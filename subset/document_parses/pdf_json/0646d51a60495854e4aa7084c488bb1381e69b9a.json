            "text": "Hundreds of different fast-growing Salix hybrids have been developed mainly for energy crops. In this paper, we studied water extracts from the bark of 15 willow hybrids and species as potential antimicrobial additives. Treatment of ground bark in water under mild conditions extracted 12\u221225% of the dry material. Preparative high-performance liquid chromatography is proven here as a fast and highly efficient tool in the small-scale recovery of raffinose from Salix bark crude extracts for structural elucidation. Less than half of the dissolved material was assigned by chromatographic (gas chromatography and liquid chromatography) and spectroscopic (mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy) techniques for lowmolecular-weight compounds, including mono-and oligosaccharides (sucrose, raffinose, and stachyose) and aromatic phytochemicals (triandrin, catechin, salicin, and picein). The composition of the extracts varied greatly depending on the hybrid or species and the harvesting season. This information generated new scientific knowledge on the variation in the content and composition of the extracts between Salix hybrids and harvesting season depending on the desired molecule. The extracts showed high antibacterial activity on Staphylococcus aureus with a minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 0.6\u22120.8 mg/mL; however, no inhibition was observed against Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, and Salmonella typhimurium. MIC of triandrin (i.e., 1.25 mg/ mL) is reported for the first time. Although antibacterial triandrin and (+)-catechin were present in extracts, clear correlation between the antibacterial effect and the chemical composition was not established, which indicates that antibacterial activity of the extracts mainly originates from some not yet elucidated substances. Aquatic toxicity and mutagenicity assessments showed the safe usage of Salix water extracts as possible antibacterial additives.",

            "text": "While the viral disease COVID-19 is sweeping the world, its lethality appears to be associated with the secondary bacterial sequelae, such as the ventilator-acquired bacterial pneumonia, as the lung has no defensive barrier against this bacterium. 1 Such defenseless state is partially caused by the antimicrobial resistance (AMR) of the bacteria, developed, for example, by the antibiotics used in indoor poultry farming to promote growth and reduce chicken mortality. Although the mechanism of growth promotion in food animals is not fully established, antimicrobial agents are presumed to maintain intestinal health by regulating bacterial populations of the microbiome. Use of traditional antibiotics causes the resistance of pathogenic bacteria, which subsequently pose a health threat to human\ue0d5 for example, Campylobacter and Salmonella pathogens, both resistant to quinolones, can infect animals and humans. 2 In 2006, EU banned the use of antibiotics as growth promoters in animal feed. 3 Currently, only antimicrobial feed additives (e.g., ionophore coccidiostats) are allowed for their antimicrobial and antiparasitic properties. European AMR Surveillance Network (EARS-Net) reported that AMR infections have been responsible for 33 000 annual deaths by 2015. 4 Nevertheless, the global need of the antimicrobials in food animals is predicted to rise by 67% from 63 151 tons (year 2010) to 105 596 tons (year 2030). 5 Therefore, there has been a great interest in developing novel antibiotic alternatives to hinder the further growth of the AMR in animals and humans.",

            "text": "In the years 1981\u22122019, the naturally or mimic-based naturally occurring metabolites represented almost half of the newly registered drugs by FDA (U.S. Food and Drug Administration), thus their share being almost 2 times higher than that of the synthetic drugs (24.6%). 6 Natural metabolites have similar beneficial effects as traditional antibiotics. 2 The dietary willow (Salix alba) bark extract in the poultry feed has reduced significantly proliferation of pathogenic bacteria (i.e., Enterobacteriaceae) under heat stress and also stimulated growth of the favorable bacteria, such as lactobacilli, in the gut of broilers. 7 Furthermore, the supply chain of other nature antimicrobials (e.g., essential oils, functional peptides, nisin, lysozymes, and so forth) may not as sustainable as willow tree because the renewable willow can be sustainably grown on abandoned peatland, 7 which can help in soil carbon sequestration and thus promote carbon-neutral societies. Moreover, the pharmacological and stress-regulating activities of Salix phytochemicals are well known. Salicin has traditionally been made of willow bark, inhibiting the growth of both Helicobacter pylori by suppressing the mutagenic effect of metronidazole 8 and Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) bacteria. 9 Picein, the major metabolite in the willow bark water extracts, 10 has a significant role in the defensing mechanism against spruce budworm. 11 Triandrin is a stress regulator for the plant's adaptogenic activity. 12 Catechin is also a stress regulator that potentiates the antimicrobial activity of gentamicin against S. aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa). 13 Raffinose is a natural trisaccharide containing galactose, glucose, and fructose, which are prebiotic agents that promote the growth of lactobacilli. 14 Although many studies on willow extractives have been published, a systematic approach for upgrading and utilizing these novel metabolites is still lacking, especially for the highly productive energy willow. It is hypothesized that pure extractive compounds can be produced in high yields through selection of the species or hybrid and harvesting season. The overall objective of this study was to evaluate the potential use of willow bark water extracts as antibiotic alternatives. We aimed to gain the knowledge on the variations in the water extract content, phytochemical composition, and their antibacterial activities. Furthermore, an in vivo toxicological and mutagenic evaluation of crude extracts was performed to assess their safe usages for animals and environment.",

Evaluation of the antimicrobial activity of both the bark extracts and authentic pure metabolites was performed by broth microdilution assay following recommendations outlined by the CLSI standard. 18 In brief, bacteria were grown on Mueller Hinton agar for 24 h at 37\u00b0C and resuspended in sterile normal saline solution and turbidity of the bacterial suspension was evaluated using a McFarland densitometer (DEN-1, BioSan, Warren MI, USA). All willow bark extracts were dissolved in water at a concentration of 20 or 100 mg/mL. Picein, salicin, and triandrin were dissolved in water at a concentration of 20 mg/mL, (+)-catechin was dissolved in ethanol at 50 mg/mL, and (\u2212)-epicatechin in 1:1 water/acetone at 10 mg/ mL. The test samples were diluted in cation-adjusted Mueller Hinton broth to 2 times the final concentration. Minimum and maximum controls with the diluent and a positive control [ciprofloxacin at minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC)] were also prepared. 100 \u03bcL of the sample and control dilutions were transferred onto a clear sterile 96-well plate in triplicate, followed by 100 \u03bcL of the bacterial suspension of 10 6 cfu/mL. No bacterial suspension was added into the minimum control. The assay plate was incubated at 37\u00b0C with a shaking speed of 500 rpm (PST-60HL-4 Thermoshaker, BioSan), and bacterial growth was visually assessed after 24 h. The initial screening was performed at a concentration of 1 mg/mL (for bark extracts) or 3 mg/mL (for authentic metabolites). The selection of initial screening concentration was dictated by substance solubility and the amount of substance available for the analysis. Dose\u2212response assays were performed for compounds demonstrating strong antibacterial activity, and MICs were determined as the lowest concentration resulting in no visible bacterial growth. We used the following dilution scheme: from 1 to 0.3 mg/mL with the dilution step 0.1 mg/mL for crude extracts and from 2 to 0.25 mg/mL with the dilution step 0.25 for (+)-catechin and triandrin. The dose\u2212response assays were repeated two times. In cases when the obtained MIC values did not match but fell within \u00b11 dilution, we performed a third repeat and reported the MIC value obtained in two matching experiments out of three. Statistical analysis for the antibacterial activity study is not applicable to the data sets of two independent experiments (performed in triplicate wells).",

Therefore, this aspect is further studied here to assist in the selection of the optimal analytical method for quantification. However, the systematic quantification of the individual compound under the effect of temperature and time is out of scope of this present study.

Both raffinose and stachyose are known as cryoprotectant oligosaccharides that have a high response to the cold hardening of several plants including Salix. 27 In fact, the raffinose content of the bark extracts was the highest when the Salix stems were harvested during the winter (Figure 4) . However, the seasonal effect on the content of aromatic components (i.e., salicin, picein, catechin, and triandrin) was not as clear as the effects on sucrose and raffinose in Figure 4 . The aromatic phytochemical composition of the Salix bark extracts ( Figure 5 and Table S8 ) varied largely depending on the hybrid or species. Only (+)-catechin was present approximately in an equal amount (15\u221225 mg/g) independent of the Salix hybrid. Catechin is quite unstable under neutral pH but rather stable under an acidic environment. 28 Triandrin was always present, but its content showed large variation (8\u2212 170 mg/g) between the samples, whereas picein occurred only in S. myrsinifolia and hybrid Karin.

Hybrid selection of their bark extract is based on their different abundance (Table S9 ) of bioactive chemical components. Initial screening of bark extracts (1 mg/mL) of selected hybrids (Klara, Karin, S. myrsinofolia, Tora, and Erna) showed strong antibacterial activity against S. aureus but not against three other bacterial species E. faecalis, S. typhimurium, and E. coli (Table S9 ). S. aureus is a Gram-positive microorganism with widely occurring resistance to a variety of antibiotics, such as methicillin, and is in the global priority list of antibioticresistant bacteria by the World Health Organization. 32 Activity against S. aureus was investigated in more detail by testing the activity of individual metabolites (triandrin, (+)-catechin, salicin, and picein) and determining MIC values for the compounds which inhibited bacterial growth, as well as MIC values of selected hybrid extracts. Only triandrin (MIC of 1.25 mg/mL) and (+)-catechin (MIC of 1.75 mg/mL) 33 showed significant antibacterial activity against S. aureus, resulting in the eradication of viable bacteria after 24 h incubation ( Table  2) .",

Raffinose is for the first time systematically purified through preparative HPLC, characterized through GC\u2212MS/GC-FID examination, and further verified through GC-FID, NMR, and LC-HRMS. The bark extract composition varied greatly between the willow hybrids and species. Unlike triandrin and (+)-catechin, large amounts of picein were present in few cases only. The greatest seasonal variation was observed for sucrose and raffinose which were specifically present in samples harvested during winter. This exploration may launch a new era for applying Salix metabolites as genuinely novel antimicrobials to improve our resistance toward zoonotic pathogens, not only to enhance the growth productivity and gut health of food animals. Additional work will be needed to fully characterize the bark extracts (particularly the flavonoid-rich tannins) and the synergistic mechanisms behind their antibacterial activity. We will investigate, in vivo, the effect of Salix metabolites on animal performance and intestinal health.
