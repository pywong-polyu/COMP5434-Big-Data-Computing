They are the most common type of nasal mass and are smooth and gelatinous structures that are attached to the mucosal membrane by a thin stalk or pedicle. 1 The frequency of observing nasal polyps is approximately 1-4 per cent, and the condition is 2-4 times more widespread in men than women. 2,3 Although many theories have been suggested with regard to their aetiopathogenesis, no firm conclusion has as yet been reached. However, it is believed that allergic, infectious, mechanical, immunological and biochemical factors play a role. 3 Histopathologically, mucosal swelling induced by inflammation is caused by basal membrane thickening, atypical gland formation, goblet cell hyperplasia, inflammatory cell infiltration and subepithelial oedema. 4 The viral aetiology of sinonasal polyps was evaluated for the first time in 1966 by Weille. 5 Although it is believed that viruses play a role in the formation of polyps, this has not been proven in studies on adenovirus, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), herpes simplex virus and human papillomavirus (HPV). 6 This study aimed to identify the role of human adenovirus, metapneumovirus, coronavirus, parainfluenza virus type 1, 2 and 3, influenza A and B virus, respiratory syncytial virus A and B and rhinovirus A and B on nasal polyp aetiology using polymerase chain reaction technique.",

It has been suggested that many exogenic and endogenic factors result in the formation of nasal polyps, including bacterial and viral infections. [7] [8] [9] [10] In this study, conducted using polymerase chain reaction, known to be a reliable technique, we concluded that there was no association between nasal polyps and viral infections, which is compatible with the existing English language literature. 11 Although the prevalence of nasal polyps is 1-4 per cent, 2,3 in one endoscopic autopsy study, it was shown that this value may increase up to 32 per cent. 12 Nasal polyposis affects adults in the majority of cases and it is generally observed in subjects older than 20 years of age. Although nasal polyposis is not frequently observed in children under the age of 10, ciliary disorders, such as cystic fibrosis, come to mind when it is observed in this age group. There is a 2:1 male/female ratio in nasal polyposis. One in three patients with nasal polyps are also diagnosed with asthma, but only 7 per cent of asthma patients are diagnosed with this condition. 13 Viral factors, such as the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), HPV and herpes simplex virus have been studied in nasal polyps. The existence of a high rate of EBV in patients with nasal polyps from Hong Kong has been shown using various techniques (15 per cent by Southern blot, 69 per cent by polymerase chain reaction and 85 per cent by in situ hybridisation. The EBV is very rare in nasal polyps whereas it is diagnosed in 88 per cent of patients with normal nasopharyngeal mucus; therefore, the contribution of the EBV to the aetiology of nasal polyps has not been taken into consideration among other possibilities. 14 In a study conducted in Canada in patients with nasal polyps, in situ hybridisation was used to identify EBV from DNA, but no EBV was identified. 15 Most probably, the difference observed in EBV positivity was due to the geographical differences of the study cases and the various techniques used in the studies. Polymerase chain reaction is believed to be a more sensitive technique than fluorescence in situ hybridisation, and we used the former technique to study virus expression in nasal mucosa.",
