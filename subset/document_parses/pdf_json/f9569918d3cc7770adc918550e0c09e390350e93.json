Respondents completed questionnaires on substance use, adjustment, parenting quality, and children's mood and behavior problems 15 years after baseline, and again via an online survey in the first three months of the COVID-19 pandemic. Results were mixed, with some indications of better adjustment of PROSPER intervention compared to control participants during the early phase of the pandemic (less increase in alcohol use and less decrease in parenting warmth) and their children (lower levels of externalizing and internalizing problems) but several null results as well (no differences in other substance use behaviors, other parenting measures, or parent depression). Adolescent substance use prevention programs can foster long-term individual and interpersonal resilience factors that allow participants-as well as their children-to adapt and cope with unforeseen periods of acute stress and adversity with less deterioration in health and well-being.",

This high level of mortality and related morbidity is particular to the USA, where the number of preventable years of life lost per capita is 50-100% higher than in Japan and most European countries (OECD, 2021) . To reduce these health and cost burdens, the dissemination of effective behavior-change prevention strategies is critical. For the past half-century, the leading front of prevention strategy development, testing, and dissemination has been in the area of substance use, which is responsible for the majority of preventable mortality (Esser et al., 2020 ; National Institute on Drug Abuse, 2020). Over this period, universal prevention programs targeting adolescents have demonstrated the capacity to lower population-level rates of substance use. However, the dissemination of such programs is limited (National Academies of Sciences & Medicine, 2019). To demonstrate the value of substance use prevention strategies to policymakers, it is critical to assess whether the benefits of adolescent-focused prevention persist into adulthood; however, according to the US Surgeon general, we know little about this question (US Dept. of Health and Human Services, 2016) .",

Although researchers have infrequently followed participants in substance use prevention trials into adulthood to assess the hypothesized long-term impacts (Skara & Sussman, 2003) , evaluations of three multi-component substance use prevention strategies have assessed outcomes over long follow-up periods. The Midwestern Prevention Project, which implemented a school-based 6th-grade program and a 7th-grade family program (Pentz et al., 1990) , yielded long-term intervention effects on participants' reports of their own warm parenting and their children's impulsive behavior when participants were 28 to 32 years old (Riggs et al., 2009) .",

In a 24-community randomized trial, researchers demonstrated the impact of CTC on the proportion of adolescents who have initiated substance use (i.e., \"lifetime use\" or conversely, \"sustained abstinence\") from early adolescence through 10th grade (Hawkins et al., 2012) , as well as during emerging adulthood (Kuklinski et al., 2021; Oesterle et al., 2015; Oesterle et al., 2018) .

However, the PROSPER results at ages 23 and 25 replicated the contours of the CTC long-term evaluation: Although the intervention impact on rates of lifetime use remained for some types of lifetime substance misuse, there were no longer intervention effects on the recent use of most substances that had been observed earlier: there was only one positive finding at each of the two waves (cigarette use at age 23 and nonprescribed narcotic use at age 25) (Spoth et al., 2022) . Most positive findings on lifetime or current use were evident only in growth analyses (Spoth et al., 2022) . However, even if intervention effects did not reliably persist at age 25, it is possible that latent resilience engendered by the adolescent-period interventions persisted and mitigated increases in substance use or other individual and family problems during periods of stress or crisis.",

We view resilience factors as a subset of the more general category of protective factors-which can include environmental, social context, and individual factors that are protective in a specific but not general manner (e.g., alcohol refusal skills). Key dimensions of an individual's \"resilience portfolio\" (Grych et al., 2015) -relevant for a range of stressors and crisis situations-include an individual's problem-solving and social-emotional capacities. Such social-emotional capacities include an ability to be aware of and respond to one's own and others' emotions, maintain close relationships, and offer and elicit social support when needed. Moreover, Grych et al. (2015) suggest there is a reciprocal process in which strengthened resilience portfolios lead to healthier functioning and better well-being, which in turn leads to increased resilience capacities.

The substance use prevention programs on the PROSPER menu (Life Skills Training, Project Alert, All Stars, and the Strengthening Families Program, for youth ages 10-14) all promote such protective factors in addition to specifically targeting substance use (Botvin, 2000) . For example, a close analysis of the Strengthening Families Program 10-14 (SFP 10-14) attendance and outcome patterns found that curriculum content related to self-regulation/stress management was one of the three leading content areas influencing program outcomes (LoBraico et al., 2019) .",

In a different sample, we found large deteriorations in parent and children's adjustment and family relationships in a wave of data collected before the pandemic to the first months of the pandemic (Feinberg et al., 2021) . In that context, parents' social-emotional and problem-solving capacities-including interparental problem-solving and support-likely would have been important factors influencing individual and family well-being (DeGarmo & Forgatch, 2012; Dix, 1991; Mayordomo et al., 2016; Prime et al., 2020) . These capacities support parents' ability to minimize maladaptive coping strategies, such as substance use, social withdrawal, or aggression (Wills & Filer, 1996) , while maximizing adaptive coping including the maintenance of positive family relationships (Blechman et al., 1995; Wadsworth et al., 2005) . This view is supported by findings from another long-term prevention trial of a family program which focused on factors such as self-regulation, problem-solving, and supportive interpersonal relations in the context of the coparenting relationship-a related but distinct construct from romantic relationship quality-at the transition to parenthood. This study showed a long-lasting intervention impact during the pandemic, ten years after intervention (Feinberg et al., Under review) : Relative to control parents, intervention parents reported higher levels of mental health, lower levels of child problems, and better-quality couple, parent-child, and sibling relationships in the first months of the pandemic.",

Thus, we test whether PROSPER participants' and their partners and children demonstrated relatively better coping and adjustment (e.g., substance use, mental health, and family relationships) 15 years later during the first 3 months of the COVID-19 pandemic.

PROSPER (R01-DA013709, PI: Spoth) was designed to test a community-school-university partnership approach to substance use prevention delivery (Spoth et al., 2004) ; 28 school districts in Iowa and Pennsylvania were matched and randomly assigned to intervention or control conditions. Intervention communities delivered a sequence of family and school-based prevention programs for 6th and 7th graders (see Spoth et al., 2004, for details) . Due to the use of passive parent consent procedures, over 90% of students in two sequential 6th grade cohorts participated; 6th-grade participants were followed annually with school surveys through 12th grade, and a randomly selected follow-up sample (N = 1984) was assessed with online questionnaires during emerging adulthood at ages 19, 22, and 24 ( Fig. 1 ). For this study, we invited 337 PROSPER participants in their mid-to-late 20 s to participate; all had reported being a parent of a child between the ages of 1.5 and 7 either during the emerging adulthood surveys or during additional email and telephone recruitment for this study. Of those 337, 223 agreed to participate in the intergenerational (P2H) substudy. We conducted home visits starting in 2018 (T1) to assess parent and partner/coparent mental health, parenting quality, family environment, and child adjustment; 174 partners or other co-caregivers of the 223 PROSPER participants also participated in P2H home visits and/or questionnaire data collection. Recruitment and home visits were paused with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020. P2H participants were then invited via email and telephone to complete a further online questionnaire in May 2020 (T2) regarding adjustment during the pandemic; 197 PROS-PER participants and 128 of their partners or co-caregivers completed the online questionnaire. The Penn State IRB approved procedures, including consent such that participants signed informed consent forms at T1 and agreed with consent provisions presented at the beginning of the online survey by continuing with the survey (T2).",

(We did not include school district as a level in the models as ICCs for outcomes were very low-i.e., most were below 0.03, and only two were above 0.05.) Measurement time points were nested in individuals (coded as T1 = 0, T2 = 1; note that as the duration between T1 and T2 did not significantly differ between conditions, we did not include duration between time points as a covariate in the models). In the MLMs, original PROS-PER participants and their caregiving partners were modeled in each model simultaneously but separately. At level 1, we regressed PROSPER participants' and their caregiving partners' scores on time, respectively, to examine whether there were significant changes in the outcome between T1 and T2. At level 2, we regressed PROSPER participants' and their caregiving partners' intercepts and slopes on intervention status, respectively, to examine whether there were significant intervention effects on PROSPER participants' and/or their partners' intercepts and/or slopes. These models are \"multivariate,\" as participant and partner estimates (i.e., intercept and slope) correlated at both within and between levels. Effect sizes were calculated as the unstandardized regression coefficient for the intervention term divided by the square root of the between-level variance in the outcome variable to create a standardized difference score. All multilevel models were conducted using Mplus 8.3.",

Results revealed that PROS-PER participation status was not a significant moderator for either outcome. Therefore, we proceeded to use OLS regression models with a pooled sample of both original PROSPER participants and their caregiving partners and controlling for T1 child internalizing and externalizing problems. For life satisfaction which was measured at T2 only, we also tested whether PROSPER participation status was a significant moderator. Given that the interaction term was not significant, an OLS regression model with a pooled sample was carried out with intervention status as the only predictor.

Our larger question was whether adolescent substance use prevention programs can build enduring resilience that helps individuals cope with future adversities. During the pandemic, we hypothesized that adults who had been exposed to substance use prevention programming during adolescence would, as a result of enduring resilience and better coping, report better adjustment for themselves, their partners, and young children. Specifically, we examined whether adults-who had been randomized to the PROSPER intervention condition in 6th grade-and their partners reported better individual functioning, parenting, and child adjustment in the first phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. To examine resiliency, we examined the degree of change in functioning and well-being from before the pandemic to the early phase of the pandemic. Overall, results were mixed with some indications of better adjustment of participants and their children, but several null results as well.",

            "text": "For the primary outcomes of the PROSPER intervention program, we found that intervention condition participants, but not partners, reported smaller increases in the frequency of alcohol use during the pandemic relative to control respondents. In the control condition, we observed fairly large increases in alcohol use in the first months of the pandemic compared to pre-pandemic reports, with parents reporting drinking alcohol on average twice as often as before the pandemic. Our findings suggest a large intervention effect (d = \u2212 0.79), mitigating the increase in alcohol use found in the control condition. It is noteworthy that intervention effects were observed for change, but not for initial levels of alcohol use in our assessment prior to pandemic onset, when PROSPER participants were 26 to 28 years old. This finding is consistent with results from prior follow-up studies of this sample: At ages 19 and 24, no intervention main effects were found for recent alcohol use (Spoth et al., 2022; Spoth et al., 2017) . Thus, PROSPER's impact on alcohol use for the original study participants at ages 26-30 was likely protective, that is, observable only during a period in which participants responded to the acute stress of the pandemic with large increases in alcohol use. These findings provide support for our hypothesis that adolescent substance use prevention programs contribute to the development of youths' internal \"resilience portfolio\" (Grych et al., 2015) . For example, the impact of PROSPER's adolescent substance use prevention programs on intervention participants' problemsolving ability and assertiveness in adolescence (Redmond et al., 2009) may have persisted into adulthood, contributing to individual coping. This view is consistent with prior PROSPER reports finding cross-over effects on participants' relationship adjustment and academic achievement in emerging adulthood (LoBraico et al., Under review; Spoth et al., 2019) . Future analyses will examine whether PROSPER's effects on key resilience factors-such as problem-solving, assertiveness, and close relationships-mediated effects on participants' response to the onset of the pandemic.",

For example, research has linked alcohol use with a higher propensity for aggression, including intimate partner violence and harsh parenting (Foran & O'Leary, 2008; Miller et al., 1999) . During the pandemic, many reports suggested that intimate partner violence within households increased during the pandemic (Boserup et al., 2020) ; and one study found such increases were an indirect result of increased alcohol use (Silverio-Murillo et al., 2020) . Thus, we find it plausible-and a topic for future research-that adolescent substance use prevention buffered increases in alcohol use 15 + years later during a global health crisis, thereby protecting against increases in levels of intimate partner violence.",

Changes in tobacco use (both cigarette smoking and vaping) in the control condition were much smaller relative to the increases in alcohol use; these smaller increases may have presented little opportunity to observe a protective effect of the intervention (i.e., a floor effect). There may be more fine-grained use patterns that would reveal different results: Intermittent smokers' frequency of use is more strongly influenced than is daily smokers' use by context (e.g., being away from home, socializing, being at a bar) (Shiffman et al., 2014) . For marijuana, we note that the difference in the size of the change in use across conditions nonetheless seemed large. PROSPER participants in the control condition exhibited a large increase in the frequency of use (from average weekly marijuana use of 0.16 to 0.81), whereas the increase among intervention participants was much smaller (from 0.25 to 0.31).",

We did not find an effect in this area for negative parenting, which is strongly linked to parents' mental health problems. However, PROSPER intervention participants (not partners) reported less decline in parenting warmth than did control participants. Consistent with this finding, we also found that intervention condition parents reported lower levels of behavioral and emotional problems among their children than did control condition parents. This analysis controlled for a different measure of such behavior and emotional problems before the pandemic and thus may be viewed as a protective effect of the intervention; that is, the intervention protected families from increases in children's behavioral and emotional problems with the pandemic. In any case, this finding of better child adjustment in both behavioral and emotional dimensions, 15 + years after one parent had participated in adolescent substance use prevention programming, is an impressive indication of long-term, intergenerational spillover effects. These findings are also consistent with the evaluation results of the Midwestern Prevention Project, which demonstrated long-term intervention effects on participants' reports of their own warm parenting and their children's impulsive behavior (Riggs et al., 2009) . These findings support further examination of the intergenerational impacts of prevention in order to document and assess the full benefits of public investment in adolescent substance use prevention.",

            "text": "In conclusion, we found evidence supporting the hypothesis that a limited dosage of adolescent substance use prevention led to an improved resiliency portfolio that persisted for 15 + years, leading to mitigation of deterioration in functioning during an acutely stressful period. We hypothesize that improved resiliency allowed participants to build romantic relationships and family arrangements with partners in a way that allowed both participants and their partners to experience a higher level of life satisfaction and adjust to a global health crisis with a less increase in alcohol use and a decrease in warm parenting relative to control condition study participants. Future work will assess whether the intervention effects on parent well-being and parenting mediated impacts on participants' children during the early acute stage of the pandemic. This study indicates that intergenerational program impacts may represent a new area of economic savings for policymakers to consider. Further research should document an expanded range of societal savings due to the longterm main and protective effects of adolescent substance use prevention for both participants and family members. Currently, prevention programs typically target different outcomes (substance use, mental health, academic success, violence) and are largely funded and delivered by the government agency and administrative silos. The recognition of a core set of resiliency and common protective factors and the multifinality of intervention outcomes (Mason et al., 2007 (Mason et al., , 2008 Redmond et al., 2009; Spoth et al., 2008 Spoth et al., , 2014 supports calls for greater integration of prevention strategies at the program curriculum level. If facilitated by government support for integrated development, research, and dissemination, a cost-effective prevention strategy could target a set of core resiliency factors (Calhoun et al., 2020) , with supplemental content provided around specific problem areas (e.g., substance use, depression, suicide, academic functioning).",
