Signal transducer and activator of transcription 2 (STAT2) is a key component of interferon-stimulated gene factor 3 (ISGF3), which drives gene expression in response to IFN-I. Using electron microscopy, we found that, in naive cells, U-STAT2, lacking the activating tyrosine phosphorylation, forms a heterodimer with U-STAT1 in an inactive, anti-parallel conformation. A novel phosphorylation of STAT2 on T404 promotes IFN-I signaling by disrupting the U-STAT1-U-STAT2 dimer, facilitating the tyrosine phosphorylation of STATs 1 and 2 and enhancing the DNA-binding ability of ISGF3. IKK-\u03b5, activated by virus infection, phosphorylates T404 directly. Mice with a T-A mutation at the corresponding residue (T403) are highly susceptible to virus infections. We conclude that T404 phosphorylation drives a critical conformational switch that, by boosting the response to IFN-I in infected cells, enables a swift and efficient antiviral defense.",

The mammalian innate immune system utilizes the type I interferon (IFN-I) family as the first line of defense against viruses, as well as other types of harmful microbes. 1 In almost all cell types, IFN-I drives the transcription of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs), 2 whose products interfere with different stages of virus infection by many different mechanisms. 3, 4 All subtypes of IFN-I bind to and signal through the IFNAR heterodimeric receptor to activate the receptor-associated tyrosine kinases Janus kinase 1 (JAK1) and tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2). In turn, these kinases phosphorylate the receptor and then signal transducers and activators of transcription 1 (STAT1) and 2 (STAT2) on specific tyrosine residues, leading to the formation of the main driver of ISG transcription, IFNstimulated gene factor 3 (ISGF3).",

            "text": "As one of the three components of ISGF3, phosphorylated STAT2 is essential, providing not only the major transactivation domain, but connecting to STAT1 through its Src-homology 2 (SH2) domain, and to IRF9 through its coil-coiled (CC) domain. 5 In untreated cells, U-STAT1 and U-STAT2 form a very stable, inactive heterodimer, without IRF9, but the structure of this heterodimer is not known. 6, 7 Combining electron microscopic (EM) and biochemical analyses, we demonstrate that U-STAT1 and U-STAT2 assemble in an anti-parallel conformation (U-dimer) that inhibits IFN-I-dependent signaling. The novel phosphorylation of T404 of STAT2 specifically disrupts the U-dimer, facilitating a rapid response to IFN-I, and also greatly enhancing the affinity of ISGF3 for ISG promoters. We further demonstrate that, by activating IKK\u03b5, viruses elevate T404 phosphorylation. As a consequence, phosphorylation-deficient T403A/T403A mice (corresponding to T404 in humans) have a severely compromised antiviral defense due to an insufficient and delayed transcriptional response to IFN-I. T404 phosphorylation, by driving an inducible conformational switch of the U-STAT1-U-STAT2 heterodimer, enables a much more efficient antiviral response. By using this mechanism, infected cells are more responsive to IFN-I than uninfected cells, promoting a more efficient antiviral response in IFN I-treated infected cells than in IFN I-treated cells that have not yet been infected.",

The EM map unambiguously demonstrates that the U-dimer has an anti-parallel conformation (Fig. 1a) , and reveals that its conformation resembles the previously determined structure of the anti-parallel U-STAT1 homodimer. 8, 9 Based on the known structure of the U-STAT1 homodimer (PDB entry: 1YVL) and the three-dimensional reconstructed EM map, 9 we modeled the conformation of the U-dimer (Fig. 1a) . Our current EM map, despite in low resolution, enables us to observe three proteinprotein interfaces that stabilize the anti-parallel conformation, including STAT1-ND (N-terminal domain)-STAT2-ND, STAT1-CCD (coiled-coil domain)-STAT2-DBD (DNA-binding domain), and STAT1-DBD-STAT2-CCD (Fig. 1b) . To validate this structural model, we designed several truncated versions of STAT1 and STAT2 and used glutathione S-transferase (GST) pull-down assays to examine the formation of heterodimer, confirming that STAT2 interacts mainly through the DBD of STAT1, and vice versa (Supplementary information, Fig. S1b, c) . Since the anti-parallel conformation Article represents an inhibitory state of this STAT complex, the question of how this inhibitory state is disfavored arises. Interestingly, a post-translational modification (PTM) site, T404, identified in our mass spectrometry analysis, resides in the core of the heterodimeric interfaces (Fig. 1b, c) . We expect that the addition of a bulky, negatively-charged phosphate group would disrupt the stable STAT1-STAT2 heterodimer interfaces, providing a clear example of how PTMs might be critical regulators of IFN-Idependent signaling.",

Without IFN-I treatment, the binding of U-STAT1 to U-STAT2 was greatly enhanced by the T404A mutation of STAT2 (Fig. 1d) and severely inhibited by the T404E mutation. In IFN-treated cells, there was no effect of these mutations on the stability of the complex between tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT1 and STAT2.

We also found that the expression of canonical ISGs (IFIT1 and OAS1) was enhanced by the F172A and Q340W mutations, which destabilize the antiparallel conformation (Fig. 1f) . Notably, because the tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT2 was delayed by the F77A mutation of STAT1 (Supplementary information, Fig. S1e ), ISG induction was compromised upon IFN-I treatment.

The F175A mutant of U-STAT2 fails to bind to U-STAT1 and IRF9, suggesting that U-STAT1 and IRF9 compete for binding to U-STAT2 through this residue. 5 The T404A mutant of U-STAT2 has a stronger interaction with U-STAT1, but a weaker interaction with IRF9, while the effect of the T404E mutation of U-STAT2 on its interactions with STAT1 and IRF9 is completely opposite (Fig. 1g ). In our model of the U-dimer, F173 of STAT2 is located in the CC domain near F175, but facing inward, suggesting that the inhibition of ISGF3 function seen with the F173A mutant might be due to a local conformational change. Consistent with this idea, the response to IFN-\u03b2 is severely compromised in U6A cells expressing the mutants T404A or F175A (Fig. 1h) . These results reveal that F175 of U-STAT2 is important for its interaction with both U-STAT1 and IRF9, and that T404 phosphorylation is the switch for a conformational change of U-dimer, which is a potent negative regulator of IFN-I-dependent signaling.",

Of these genes, 55 (Supplementary information, Fig. S2c ) were affected at all three time periods. Most of them are well-known ISGs (Supplementary information, Table S1), with canonical interferon-stimulated response elements (ISREs) in their promoters (Supplementary information, Fig. S2d ).

We also used electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) with an ISRE probe to assess the ability of ISGF3 to bind to DNA. In U6A cells that express WT STAT2, ISGF3 was detected readily. The amount of ISGF3 capable of binding to an ISRE sequence is greatly enhanced by the T404E mutation of STAT2 and severely inhibited by the T404A mutation (Supplementary information, Fig. S2e ). We conclude that the phosphorylation of T404, which lies in the DNA binding domain of STAT2, enhances the affinity of ISGF3 for ISREs. Previously, we found that the phosphorylation of STAT2 T387 has an effect opposite to that of the phosphorylation of T404 in IFN-Idependent signaling, and in U-STAT1-STAT2 formation. 6 However, the T-to-D mutation of T387 does not mimic the phosphorylation, indicating that the effect of T387 phosphorylation is not mediated by the negative charge, and suggesting that T387 phosphorylation Fig. 2 Phosphorylation of STAT2 on T404 expedites the tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT2, and enhances the DNA-binding activity of ISGF3. a U6A cells expressing WT or T404A STAT2 were treated with IFN-\u03b1 or IFN-\u03b2 (100 IU/ml).

Cells were treated with IFN-\u03b2 for 2 h, followed by treatment with Staurosporine, a kinase inhibitor that rapidly blocks tyrosine phosphorylation. This procedure permits analysis of the rate of decay of the initially phosphorylated residues. The T404E mutation did not suppress the de-phosphorylation of tyrosine residues of either STAT1 or STAT2 (Supplementary information, Fig. S2h ).

            "text": "Virus infection induces the T404 phosphorylation of STAT2 by IKK-\u03b5 We generated a specific polyclonal antibody against a STAT2 peptide that includes phosphorylated T404 and used ELISA to demonstrate that this antibody does not cross-react with the corresponding un-phosphorylated peptide (Supplementary information, Fig. S3a ). To identify kinases responsible for STAT2 T404 phosphorylation, we found that the amino acid sequence surrounding T404 in STAT2 is a good match with sequences that are preferentially phosphorylated by IKK-\u03b5. Phosphorylation of STAT1 on S708 by IKK-\u03b5 is known to regulate the formation of STAT1 homodimers in response to IFN-\u03b3, but not ISGF3 formation in response to IFN-I. 13, 14 Western analyses employing this antibody showed that the phosphorylation of STAT2 on T404 is induced by ectopic expression of IKK-\u03b5, but not a kinase-dead mutant enzyme (Fig. 3a) . We also used an in vitro kinase assay to demonstrate that IKK-\u03b5 phosphorylates T404 of STAT2 directly (Fig. 3b) . Confirming this result, the phosphorylation of STAT2 was greatly impaired when T404 was mutated. We also evaluated TBK1, a homolog of IKK-\u03b5, finding that it can also phosphorylate STAT2 on T404, although not as robustly as IKK-\u03b5 (Fig. 3b) . To obtain more information on how these kinases phosphorylate STAT2 on T404, we performed in vitro pull-down assays with purified IKK-\u03b5 and TBK1. STAT2 binds directly to both IKK-\u03b5 (Fig. 3c ) and TBK1 (Supplementary information, Fig. S3b ). Using a set of GST-fusion proteins with different IKK-\u03b5 truncations, we detected a direct interaction between the kinase domain of IKK-\u03b5 and STAT2 (Supplementary information, Fig. S3c ), and also found that the STAT2 DBD, which includes T404, binds directly to IKK-\u03b5 (Supplementary information, Fig. S3d ). In addition, a coimmunoprecipitation experiment using HEK293T cells with ectopic expression of both STAT2 and IKK-\u03b5 revealed that the T404A mutation did not abrogate their interaction (Fig. 3d) . These data indicate that IKK-\u03b5 binds directly to the DBD of STAT2 to phosphorylate T404 as an important component of a robust response to IFN-I, while TBK1 has a weaker ability to phosphorylate this residue.",

Data are shown as means \u00b1 SEM from two independent experiments. P values were calculated using the paired ratio t-test (**P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001, ns, not significant). Fig. S5c ). In addition to VSV, an RNA virus, we also challenged the mice with HSV, a DNA virus, and found that T403 phosphorylation of STAT2 is essential for antiviral defense in vivo (Fig. 4g) . Impaired virus clearance, due to a compromised IFN response, leads to severe viral encephalitis in T403A/T403A mice Viral infection activates host immune responses and induces the expression of IFNs and other cytokines. When the mice were challenged with VSV for a short time, the amount of IFN-\u03b2 induced was higher in most of the tissues from T403A/T403A mice (Supplementary information, Fig. S5d) , showing that the susceptibility of these mice to VSV is not due to a deficiency in the production of IFN-I. We also determined how infection correlated with induction of the IFN response, by checking the expression of ISGs in spleens, as the lymphoid organ most critical for detection and response to infection. The level of VSV genomic RNA was dramatically higher in the tissues of T403A/T403A mice than in WT/WT mice (Fig. 4h) . Interestingly, the expression of ISGs induced by infection was much lower in the former, especially at early time points (Fig. 4i) . The above data is consistent with our previous finding (Fig. 2f) , indicating that T404/403 phosphorylation expedites antiviral defense by enhancing responses to IFN-I.",

These proteins mediate significant antiviral activity 23 as well as resistance to DNA damage in cancer cells. 24, 25 Our study of the U-STAT1-U-STAT2 dimer, including structural insights together with demonstration of biochemical and biological significance, provides a greatly expanded understanding of the detailed regulation of IFNdependent signaling, especially seemingly paradoxical functions of the STAT1-STAT2 dimer as a positive or negative regulator of cytokine responses, depending on the conformation.",

A delayed response to IFN-I following virus infection leads to impaired virus clearance, which further transits into an exuberant proinflammatory immune response, called a cytokine storm. Our results with in vivo VSV infections show that a cytokine storm is the main cause of death in mice carrying the T403A mutation of STAT2. This finding emphasizes that this newly discovered phosphorylation of STAT2 is essential for prompt IFN-mediated host defense against virus infections, an effect not limited to VSV.",

Two hours later, cells were washed with PBS and fresh culture medium was added. Cells were harvested 20 h after infection. The TCID50 assay protocol was followed as described in the chapter \"Principles of Virology\" from the textbook Fields Virology.",
