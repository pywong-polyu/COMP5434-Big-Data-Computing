            "text": "In December 2019, a new coronavirus disease (COVID-19) emerged in Wuhan (China) and then rapidly spread worldwide. The incident was classified as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 30 January 2020 and declared a pandemic on 11 March 2020 [1] . In Germany, 2,216,363 people had been infected with the coronavirus as of 31 January 2021, with 56,945 fatalities [2] . In line with recommendations from the WHO, Germany developed a pandemic preparedness plan, the main component of which is a vaccination program [3, 4] . As much of the European countries, Germany started a mass vaccination program towards the end of December 2020. Till the end of January 2020, only 1.3 million doses of COVID-19 vaccine have been administered in Germany, which has a population of 83 million and had initially ordered 55.8 million doses of the vaccine, but the rollout has been slow and beset by problems, including lack of supply, and lately, a reluctance amongst Germans to receive the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine, after German authorities declared it had not been tested rigorously enough to allow its use on the over-65 age group. That decision triggered suspicions that it was not safe. Reports of lingering side effects have not helped [2] .",

Most of the previous studies on vaccine acceptance were conducted in the pre-pandemic stage when no COVID-19 vaccines were available or only focused on certain groups, such as healthcare professionals [7] [8] [9] [10] . Thus, the existing literature may not provide a good indication of likely vaccine uptake because of changing public perceptions of the epidemic and the vaccine as the situation evolves. Additionally, there are numerous differences between healthcare professionals and the general population: healthcare workers are more susceptible to illness than the general public as a direct result of their employment and they may be endowed with specialist knowledge as a result of their professional status. It has been shown that healthcare workers that are on call for emergencies or are ready to carry out extra consultations to deal with the pandemic, as well as those who show positive attitudes towards COVID-19 protection methods, are more likely to accept a COVID-19 vaccination [11] .",

A recent investigation showed that the willingness for influenza vaccination was 45% in general population [12] , while the actual vaccination coverage was 9.4%, which was reported by a meta-analysis [13] . These indicate that there are barriers between intention and behavior besides the cognitive factors, which have affected the vaccination uptake willingness, such as not receiving a recommendation from a doctor and not having a cost-free vaccination [13] . Previous studies have examined factors associated with intention of COVID-19 vaccination [7, 9, 10] .

Studies on the uptake of seasonal influenza vaccination have shown that the perceived risk of catching influenza and belief in the efficacy of the vaccine are the main drivers towards vaccine acceptance whilst fear of adverse effects is the main deterrent [15] [16] [17] . Moreover, literature related to SARS and A/H1N1 indicated that people are more likely to comply with the recommendations if they believe that the consequences of the illness are serious, that the information provided by the government on the outbreak is accurate; that the government can be trusted to manage the outbreak; and that the outbreak is likely to last for a long time [18] [19] [20] . People with a family and/or children and those suffering from a severe chronic illness are also likely to accept the COVID-19 vaccination [7] [8] [9] . The effectiveness of a vaccination program is dependent on wide vaccine uptake, even for vaccines with high efficacy. Thus, it is important to understand the various factors that affect a person's willingness to get vaccinated in order to establish effective public health strategies during a pandemic [14, 16] .",

The questionnaire items on participants' perceptions of vaccines were partially derived from the Health Belief Model (HBM). This model is used to describe individuals' health-related behavior according to their perception of predisposition, efficacy, and outcomes. Questions investigated the participants' perceptions of the vaccine's efficacy and the likelihood of developing negative side-effects after vaccination as well as the severity of these effects (all items are presented in Table 2 ). The scores of the eight items were subjected to principal factor analysis, presenting a two-factor orthogonal rotation (r = \u22120.30, p < 0.01).

The full model with all three variable types was used to produce the following results, as presented in Table 3 . We found that the intention to get vaccinated or intake of the COVID-10 vaccine were positively related to the perceptions of becoming infected, perceptions of the severity of the potential long-term effects, the vaccine's efficacy, and the benefits of vaccination. Meanwhile, the intention to get the vaccine or vaccine intake were decreased by perceptions of the negative side-effects and the general impediments to vaccination. The most crucial factor was the perception of the vaccine's efficacy, and respondents with this belief had over 4 times greater likelihood of intending to receive the vaccine. There was also a significant relationship between being vaccinated and the perception of the pandemic situation in the country in three months' time. Next, it is interesting to note that while the media's overreporting of the side-effects was associated with the intention to get vaccinated, no such relationship was found for having been vaccinated. Additionally, having a chronic illness and general health conditions were both associated with having been vaccinated and the intention to get vaccinated. Meanwhile, marital status (being single, widowed or divorced) was not associated with having already been vaccinated; however it was significantly associated with the intention to get vaccine in the future. Belief in the vaccine's efficacy and benefits increased the likelihood of having already been vaccinated, while the perception of the side effects was negatively associated with having already been vaccinated.

This stronger tendency to accept the vaccination amongst single people could be related to concerns about not having someone to care for them if they fall ill. Another explanation could be that single people are less worried about the potential risks from vaccination because they have no dependents to be affected by these risks. The fact that chronically ill people already received the COVID-19 vaccine might be concordant with the fact that those with a chronic illness were more likely to follow rules, guidelines, and recommendations during the COVID-19 pandemic, or to take a seasonal influenza vaccination [9, 21] . The presence of a chronic illness seemed to be well correlated with vaccination status, although it did not directly affect the intention to get vaccinated. Health authority recommendations were better adhered to by people with a chronic illness than those without [3] . Females and parents of children have been previously reported to show good adherence to the recommended behaviors, whereas people of low socioeconomic or educational status were less likely to follow the recommendations [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] . However, in the present study, these factors were not found to be associated with vaccination intention. Vaccination uptake intention was found to be rather medium, irrespective of socioeconomic or demographic factors. Despite this low uptake, an encouraging aspect of this result is that the campaigns intended to increase vaccine uptake rates are likely to be equally effective among a wide range of people.",

In the present study, there was also an association between susceptibility to illness and either COVID-19 vaccination intention or intake. An association was found between the possible severe consequences of the illness and the intention to get vaccinated, as well as with the status of having already been vaccinated. These results are consistent with the outcome of a previous study indicating that the correlations between perceived susceptibility, severity, and COVID-19 vaccine acceptance were statistically significant. People who felt that the epidemic seemed to worsen in Germany were generally have already been vaccinated, whilst intention to be vaccinated was not linked to the perceptions regarding the duration of the epidemic. Furthermore, the perceived impact of the epidemic on everyday life, trust in the information on COVID-19 provided by the government, or trust in the government's management of the epidemic were not associated with the intention to be vaccinated or the vaccination intake. No strong link was found between the intention to be vaccinated or the vaccination intake and the perceptions of COVID-19. This could be because the data were collected some time after the epidemic started, so people might be taking COVID-19 less seriously and treating it like ordinary seasonal respiratory illness.",

It is likely that the respondents who had already been vaccinated had overcome the barriers in their minds, whilst those who expressed their intention to get vaccinated still had some doubts. This could also be explained by dissonance reduction, whereby people who have already received the vaccination feel the need to justify to themselves why they received it. Both the vaccination intention and the vaccination intake were significantly associated with the perception of the benefits of the vaccine. Studies related to vaccination against seasonal influenza have shown that both benefits and barriers are related to vaccination intention and likelihood [15, 16] .

            "text": "Our work suffers from limitations. First, our sample is not completely representative of the German elderly. Since the sample was not chosen at random, the inherent bias in convenience sampling means that the sample was unlikely to be representative of the population being studied. This undermines our ability to generalize from our sample to the population we were studying. Moreover, participants from our study might stay home most of time during the pandemic with limited social interactions. This means that these results cannot necessarily be extrapolated to the general elderly population. Next, in the same vein, we did not collect demographical characteristics as region of residence. Vaccine acceptance might be greater in regions highly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, as previously observed in Lombardy [31] . Third, the cross-sectional nature of this investigation precludes us from drawing causal inferences. Furthermore, the cross-sectional survey design necessarily represents a snapshot in time, rather than the evolving landscape of the public's attitudes about COVID-19 vaccination. All the information obtained was self-reported and reporting bias always exists. Although the data was collected from the heterogenous group, we targeted individuals who are willing to participate and give their answers. The individual's opinion also can be unstable. Any unexpected event could lead to drastic change in their opinion about the vaccination. Next, even though the questionnaire was anonymous, it is still possible that a social-desirability bias tainted respondents' answers to the questionnaire about intentions and behaviors. The final limitation concerns the timing of the survey that might have led to both an overestimate of willingness to receive the vaccination and an underestimate of the vaccine coverage rate among German elderly population since the controversy about the efficacy, safety, and necessity of the vaccine against COVID-19. Third wave of COVID-19 pandemic in Germany was growing over the study period [2] . Future longitudinal research is needed to determine the direction of causality for these associations. It would also be desirable to compare the public's responses in other countries that were similarly affected.",

It is clear from the results reported in this study that vaccine-related factors are more important than epidemicrelated factors in determining vaccination intention and intake. Thus, to improve the vaccination uptake rates during the COVID-19 pandemic, health authorities should focus on the vaccine-related factors rather than the aspects related to the illness. This could be particularly important in encouraging vaccine uptake in the later stages of the outbreak since people are likely to be well-informed about the illness but have misconceptions and concerns about the vaccine. Eliminating these misunderstandings and concerns is likely to increase the vaccine uptake rates during the current COVID-19 pandemic. ",
