In the immunodominance model, each individual in a population predominantly responds to a single epitope among the five antigenic epitopes of the viral hemagglutinin (HA), driving escape mutations one at a time, and sequential mutations in multiple individuals who respond to different epitopes eventually generate a drifted strain with mutations in epitopes that are targeted by a majority of the population. A focused antibody response to the Sa epitope in people born between 1965 and 1979 was believed to contribute to a mutation at HA residue 163 and the first antigenic drift of the 2009 pandemic influenza A H1N1 virus. A serine-to-threonine mutation at HA residue 185 in the Sb epitope emerged in 2010 even before the 163 mutation. We show here that a large fraction of the population in 2010-2011 had responses to the Sb epitope, as shown by 47% of tested sera having altered titers to the S185T mutant. Responses to the Sb epitope showed an age-specific trend similar to that found for the response to Sa epitope in these subjects. Together, the focused responses to Sa and Sb epitopes may have driven the first antigenic drift of the 2009 pandemic H1N1 virus.",

There are five major B cell epitopes located around the receptorbinding site on the HA head of influenza A H1N1 -Sa, Sb, Ca1, Ca2, and Cb -which are the main targets of hemagglutination-inhibiting and neutralizing antibodies [1] [2] [3] .",

            "text": "While the mutation rate of influenza virus is high, it is not high enough to allow mutations in all five major epitopes to arise simultaneously in an infected individual or even in the whole world population. Therefore, it is believed that antigenic drift occurs in a stepwise fashion. An individual predominantly responds to one or a few epitopes and drives mutations only in that particular epitope. Mutations accumulate after the virus sequentially infects multiple individuals who respond to different epitopes. At the population level, the number of mutated epitopes required to cause an antigenic drift depends on the coverage of epitope responses in the majority of the population. When the majority of the population have responses focused on the same epitope, it is easier for a new drifted strain to emerge, since there is less mutation required than when diverse epitopes are involved [4] . It was previously reported that people born between 1965 and 1979 had antibody responses to the HA Sa epitope of the pandemic 2009 influenza A H1N1 virus, and this focused response led to the emergence of a lysineto-glutamine mutation at HA position 163 (K163Q) in the Sa epitope, which was responsible for the first antigenic drift of the 2009 H1N1 virus [5, 6] . While this K163Q mutation was first detected in 2012, a serine-to-threonine mutation at HA position 185 (S185T) in the Sb epitope emerged in 2010, and it is still unknown if this mutation contributed to antigenic Handling Editor: Ayato Takada.",

To prevent nonspecific agglutination, the treated sera were incubated with 50% goose red blood cells for 60 minutes at 4 \u00b0C. The treated sera were serially diluted twofold from 1:40 to 1:2560.

Thereafter, 50 \u03bcl of a 0.5% suspension of goose red blood cells was added to each well, and the plate was kept at 4 \u00b0C for 30 minutes. Virus backtitration was performed in parallel. The highest serum dilution that completely inhibited the hemagglutination reaction was defined as the HAI titer. HAI assays were performed in two independent experiments.

The average age of those who had an HAI titer \u2265 40 was 41 \u00b1 11 years old. Among these subjects with antibody response to the pandemic virus WT-2009, only 14% maintained similar titers to WT-2016. This indicated the expected antigenic drift of WT-2016 from the responses in 2010-2011. This 14% of the sera that could still recognize WT-2016 well without a drop in titer might have had antibodies to epitopes that were not mutated in the 2016 virus, i.e. Ca1 and Ca2. Sa-specific antibodies in 2010 sera were found in 44 subjects (79%) in all age groups ) whose titers against 2009-K163Q showed a significant drop. In accordance with the previously published data [5] , people born between 1965 and 1979 had the most frequent responses to the Sa epitope. It was found that 91% of people (30 out of 33) born between 1965 and 1984 had have had responses to other epitopes. This was more common in people born between 1955 and 1964, as shown by the drop in the response rates to both the Sa and Sb epitopes in this age group (Fig. 4) . These suggest an age difference among people with preferential responses to the Sa, Sb, and Cb or other epitopes.",

            "text": "Previous data [5] Although the S185T mutant emerged and became dominant before 2012, it did not cause a major outbreak until the K163Q mutation came along in 2013. It is likely that the response to the Sa epitope could suppress the Sb epitope mutant because the majority of the population had responses to both epitopes in the same individuals. It is also possible that the antigenic drift of the H3N2 virus in 2012 contributed to the suppression of H1N1 by competition. Nevertheless, the fact that the H1N1 virus causing antigenic drift and outbreaks in 2013-2014 harbored no mutations in the antigenic epitopes other than the two mutations in the Sa and Sb epitopes indicates that these two epitopes were the targets of the first antigenic drift of the pandemic H1N1 virus and that the focused responses to these two epitopes were the main driving force of the drift. Although our data and those of Linderman, et al. [5] showed age-specific differences in the response to the Sa epitope, the levels of differences were not similar between the two studies. While the previous data showed that the response to K163 dropped sharply in people born in 1980-1984 and was undetected in people born between 1985 and 1997, our data showed that individuals born in 1985-1988 still had antibodies to K163 to some extent. Whether this difference was due to differences in previous experiences with seasonal H1N1 viruses in different geographical regions or possibly to racial differences is unclear. The small sample size of the younger age group in our study makes accurate estimation of the actual response rate in this age group difficult.",

However, from September 2013 to February 2014 [12] , the largest groups that were affected by influenza were young and middle-aged adults (18-64 years old). This implies that, in this particular influenza season, the antigenic drift had occurred in a way that disproportionately affected middleaged adults. This suggests that the antigenic drift in 2013 might not have affected children who had not responded to the drifted Sa and Sb epitopes.",

Sera were counted as having a drop in titer when at least a one-fold reduction in HAI titer was observed in both experiments representing the \"original antigenic sin\". They therefore developed responses targeting this epitope, which shared similarity in the pandemic H1N1 virus. Our data also showed some age-specific differences in the responses to the S185 epitope, which suggest that the Sb epitope shared some similarity to previous seasonal H1N1 viruses causing an original antigenic sin. These data contribute to our understanding of the role of previous exposures and antigenic sins on the anti-influenza immune response and antigenic drift, which might help in predicting future antigenic drift.

Our data now also show that a large fraction of the population in 2010-2012 responded to the Sb epitope. This focused response to the Sb epitope might have contributed to the selective pressure for the first antigenic drift of the 2009 pandemic H1N1 virus. The S185T mutation in the Sb epitope appeared in 2010 and became dominant in 2011, and all strains after 2012 had threonine at this position. The K163Q mutation in the Sa epitope appeared in 2012 and almost completely replaced the wild-type strain in 2014. H1N1 influenza outbreaks and vaccine escape suggesting antigenic drift were first observed in the 2013-2014 influenza season of the northern hemisphere. According to the US CDC influenza reports, the H1N1 pandemic subsided after 2010, and influenza A H3N2 virus dominated the influenza seasons for three years until the 2013-2014 season, when H1N1 virus again became the dominant virus and influenza incidence exceeded the epidemic threshold, indicating a more severe influenza season. The 2010-2011 and the 2011-2012 seasons were within the seasonal baseline, whereas the 2012-2013 season exceeded the epidemic threshold because of the antigenic drift of the H3N2 virus, resulting in a change of the vaccine strain from A/Perth/16/2009 (H3N2)-like virus to A/Victoria/361/2011 (H3N2)-like virus.",
