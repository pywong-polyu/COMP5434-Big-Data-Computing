We also evaluated the prognostic value of this classification to predict the severity of COVID-19.",

We tested quantitative CT analysis as an outcome predictor for COVID-19. Quantitative CT analysis was performed using a semi-automated method (Thoracic Volume Computer-Assisted Reading software, GE Health care, United States). Lungs were divided by Hounsfield unit intervals. Compromised lung (%CL) volume was the sum of poorly and non-aerated volumes (\u2212 500, 100 HU).

Among imaging markers, computed tomography (CT) provides the most sensitive radiological technique for the diagnosis of COVID-19, revealing diffuse lung alterations, ranging from groundglass opacity to consolidation [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] . In addition, different radiological lung patterns are manifested over the course of the disease. Research using quantitative methods to evaluate lung CT images to derive various image analysis scores has suggested the possibility of predicting the severity of the disease [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] . However, there are limited opportunities in clinical practice to use these quantitative image analysis approaches [11, 12, 14] . To address this limitation, we recently conducted a singlecenter retrospective study of patients with COVID-19 at St Luke's International Hospital, Tokyo, to investigate if a simple visual assessment of CT images could predict the severity of COVID-19. We identified three patterns of pneumonia findings based on visual analysis of CT images, which could be associated with disease severity. Our primary objective in this study was to investigate the reliability of the classification of these patterns and their utility in predicting the clinical outcomes of COVID-19.",

A complete segmentation included both lungs with interstitial structures, segmentary vessels, and bronchi. The major pulmonary arteries and bronchi, all mediastinal structures, eventual pleural effusion, and lung masses (e.g., tumors, fungal disease) were excluded. We extracted the lung volumes and calculated the percentage of the total volume affected, according to different Hounsfield unit (HU) intervals, into non-aerated (NNL) (% NNL, density between 100 and \u2212 100 HU), poorly aerated (PAL) (% PAL, \u2212 101 to \u2212 500 HU), normally aerated (NAL) (% NAL, \u2212 501 to \u2212 900 HU), and hyperinflated (\u2212 901 to \u2212 1000 HU) [17] . The additional \"compromised lung\" (% CL) volume was calculated as the sum of % PAL and % NNL (\u2212 500 to 100 HU) (Fig. 2) .

Furthermore, we tested quantitative CT analysis as an outcome predictor for COVID-19 using a semi-automated method. In univariate logistic regression analysis, three CT patterns and quantitative CT analysis were significant. However, only the three CT patterns were retained as an independent predictor of tracheal intubation in the multivariate logistic regression analysis, with patients with a diffuse CT pattern being at the highest risk and requiring prolonged duration of intubation. COVID-19 pneumonia has an extremely variable prognosis [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] . While 80% of patients are either asymptomatic or have mild symptoms, 20% develop severe or profound disease and eventually die [22] [23] [24] [25] . CT imaging of the lungs plays an important role in the care of patients infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), with the prognostic value of CT evaluated in several studies [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [18] [19] [20] [21] . However, most of these studies are from China, Europe, and the United States, with no information available for patient cohorts in Japan [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] . In addition, several researchers have used image analysis software to quantify CT findings, making these impractical in daily clinical practice [25] [26] [27] . Practicality in clinical practice was our motivation to develop and evaluate the prognostic value of our visually-based assessment of CT lung findings (peripheral, multifocal, and diffuse) in a hospital patient cohort in Tokyo, Japan, a city with a particularly high SARS-CoV-2 prevalence. COVID-19 pneumonia shares a similar pathogenesis to acute exacerbation of interstitial pneumonia. Volume loss because of alveolar collapse is the primary cause of traction bronchiectasis in COVID-19 pneumonia. However, the extent of involved alveoli and mucosa may expand with disease progression. In addition, inflammation-related damage to the bronchial walls may lead to fibrosis, bronchiectasis, and bronchial wall thickening. Thus, COVID-19 is associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome and may produce CT findings similar to acute exacerbation of interstitial pneumonia [17] . Akira et al. reported that the prognosis of acute exacerbation in interstitial pneumonia could be predicted by classifying findings on lung CT images into peripheral, multifocal, and diffuse patterns [15] . In our study, we applied the same classification to patients with COVID-19 and evaluated if these three patterns were predictive of patients' clinical course. By simply classifying the CT images of a COVID-19 patient into three patterns, we can predict the requirement and duration of intubation for that patient, allowing us to quickly and easily allocate optimal medical resources to the patient. In addition, this study revealed that the requirement for intubation can be predicted through our method as efficiently as, or better than, through quantitative analysis of CT images, indicating the possibility that the prognosis of COVID-19 patients can be predicted to some extent by visual judgment of CT images even in institutions that cannot introduce software for CT analysis.",

            "text": "We also compared the clinical variables in three different CT patterns. As a result, the following clinical variables were significantly different between the diffuse pattern and peripheral and multifocal groups: body temperature, lymphocyte count, neutrophil count, c-reactive protein, lactate dehydrogenase, Krebs von den Lungen-6 antigen, D-dimer, and steroid and favipiravir administration. These results suggest that the more extensive the abnormal findings in the lungs, the more severe the systemic over-inflammatory response in COVID-19. The laboratory features presented by this study could be attributed to respiratory failure, septic shock, and/or The identification of prognostic factors at an early stage of the disease could help guide clinicians in providing an optimal treatment path based on patient-specific characteristics, as well as predict more precisely where medical resources are most required. The reason for the lack of an association between mortality and the length of hospital stay and the three CT patterns is unclear. Nonetheless, the study population presumably included some of the earliest patients following the pandemic, and the treatment methods were inconsistent, thereby resulting in a lack of correlation between mortality and the length of hospital stay. Another reason is that the aggressive use of steroids and favipiravir in patients with severe COVID-19 may have prevented a significant difference in mortality. We intend to collect more data in the future to clarify the association between CT findings and mortality. The limitations of our study should be acknowledged in the interpretation of our results. First, this was a single-center retrospective study with a small sample size. Second, only Japanese patients from the city of Tokyo were included. As such, the risk of bias related to viral factors, such as host factors and genomic variation, cannot be discounted. We do note the benefit of a single center for ensuring a uniform assessment of images. Third, cases in the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan were included in this study, and treatment methods were not consistent. Fourth, although we instructed all patients to breathe in as much as possible when CT was performed, there was a possibility that patients with poor respiratory status did not have sufficient inhalation volume. This may have affected the quantitative analysis of CT. Fifth, our hospital is one of the facilities that preferentially accepts critically ill patients with COVID-19 in our area. Therefore, we accept the patients with severe disease at our hospital and all the patients who underwent CT scan were subject to oxygen inhalation on admission. This may cause the selection bias on this study. Sixth, we did not follow the time course of the changes in CT findings in each case. Lastly, the inclusion criteria were limited to patients with pulmonary lesions on the initial CT scan; patients with no abnormalities on the initial CT scan were not included.",
