Inclusion criteria included those students \ufffd 18 years of age and those with active email accounts. We chose to utilize students during this unique time when they were home with their families as they represented a study population for which we had email addresses; were a population with a high likelihood of responding to an email survey request; and represented a mechanism through which it was felt we could get a quick snapshot of conditions in their family households to which they had returned.",

To restrict the number of parameters to be estimated, principal component analysis (PCA) for mixed (quantitative and qualitive) data were used, with varimax-rotation [15, 16] . The first three components were used to summarize all variables and used as covariates in the logistic regression. With three covariates we guarantee at least 10 events per variable, providing reliable inference for the parameters of interest. The COVID-19 pandemic is a highly dynamic situation with rapid changes happening at a societal level and constantly changing measures, such that it was felt a study which could be performed quickly may still be useful to analyze the impact of those measures at that specific moment of the pandemic. While a larger sample would be preferable, it would demand more time such that the situational context of mitigation strategies and their impacts could be completely different at survey onset compared to survey end, complicating data analysis and interpretation of the results. This study, thus, provides a snapshot of COVID-19 and its implications in this specific group during a time where stay-at-home measures were enacted.",

In order to not overfit the model, we first ran a principal component analysis (PCA) with mixed data to reduce the number of parameters into combinations with the best possible correlation, followed by a multivariable logistic regression using the first three principal components (PC1, PC2, PC3) as covariates. The loadings corresponding to PC1, PC2, and PC3 that are used in the analysis of compliance to face masks, social distancing, and to stay-at-home measures, are presented in S4 Table. The first principal component, PC1, was related to participants that were, on average, older and living with a partner; PC2 was related to participants that were sharing the house with several other people and were, on average, \"very concerned\" about the health of their household; while PC3 was related to men. Similar steps were taken to find risk factors associated with food security; a principal component regression analysis was performed, and the first three components were used as covariates. Their loadings are presented in S5 Table, suggesting that PC1 was again related to participants that were, on average, older and living with a partner; PC2 was related to participants that were sharing the house with several other people; and PC3 was related to participants with electricity in their home. In multivariable logistic regression, we found participants that reported living in a household with a larger number of people AND that reported being \"very worried\" about the health of their household were more likely to practice social distancing when they left their household (OR: 1.48; 95% CI: 1.03-2.23; p = 0.04) and more likely to comply with stay-at-home recommendations (OR: 1.50; 95% CI: 1.05-2.24; p = 0.03).

Overall, 20 participants (19.4%) had a positive depression screen with a PHQ-8 score \ufffd 10. Univariate comparisons suggest that concerns about the health of household members, household finances, and sharing a house with more people were associated with a higher odds of screening positive for depression (S6 Table) . A multivariable analysis could not be performed due to sample size. Next, we ran univariate and multivariable ordinal regression analysis (without dichotomizing depression score) to assess the impact of a priori selected variables on depression score. Variables included gender, marital status, number of people in household, as well as concern over household health, loss of income, and finances. S1 Fig shows how these variables correlate to depression score. Compared to women, men were, on average, more likely to have higher depression scores, although no statistical significance was found. Similar findings were seen for participants living with a partner and those worried about their finances. In multivariable ordinal regression (Table 5) , those factors associated with a positive PHQ-8 depression screen were being \"very worried\" about the health of one's household (OR: 2.43; 95% CI: 1.08-5.46; p = 0.03) and about one's household finances (OR: 2.27; 95% CI: 0.96-5.37; p = 0.06).",

As such, greater understanding of the effects of mitigation strategies on a given population are needed so that appropriate stop-gap measures can be put in place to support these vulnerable populations until vaccination roll-out can be fully realized.

            "text": "Liberia is one of the world's poorest countries as a result of civil conflict, major infectious disease emergencies, and overall poor governance [21, 22] . According to the United Nations Development Program (UNDP), Liberia ranked 175 of 189 countries on the 2020 Human Development Index (HDI) [23] . Following the end of Liberia's civil wars in 2003, the country began to show steady progress in terms of economics, health, and other key development indicators [24] . However, this progress quickly stalled due to the 2014-2016 West African Ebola outbreak [22] . During the 2-year period of active Ebola spread, Liberia lost~40% of wageearning jobs [25] . In the years since, Liberia once again is rebuilding, yet as of the end of 2019, it was estimated that roughly 16% of Liberia's population was food insecure and 83% lived in extreme poverty [26] . In order to understand how household economics and food security may have been impacted further as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we questioned participants about their household finances and found that nearly two-thirds were reporting losses in income as a result of the pandemic. Furthermore, this generated considerable stress, with approximately 56% of respondents reporting they were \"very worried\" about their household's finances. We also questioned participants about their household's food security based on the quantity of household food stocks and how long they would last; as well as a question about whether the participant's personal food consumption had changed in the week prior. We found that nearly two-thirds of households had food stocks that were only sufficient for oneweek or less, and roughly one-third of participants reported decreases in their personal food consumption from what they considered normal. The risk to food security across Africa as a result of COVID-19 has been well described. Many African countries are net importers of food for consumption, with their own agricultural production being prioritized for commercial exportation. During situations of emergency, this dynamic can result in both shortages to the local food supply as well as skyrocketing prices [18, 27] . Countries such as Liberia are especially vulnerable, and our findings highlight that COVID-19 mitigation strategies are likely contributing to worsening household level food security, or on the contrary, that fears about food insecurity are forcing households to make decisions that increase their risk of contracting SARS-CoV-2, due to inability to fully adhere to COVID mitigation strategies. This fact becomes more worrisome as Liberia has been identified as 1 of 10 countries in which a longerterm state of national undernutrition may be a significant driver of high COVID-19 mortality rates in the country [28] . The Government of Liberia, and its partners such as the World Food Program, have begun to address food security problems through the COVID-19 Household Food Support Program (COHFSP), targeting nearly 50,000 households for provision of staple food commodities as well as programs specifically targeting rural women and school aged children [29] . While an important first step, it's likely that much greater investments toward food security and other social protections will urgently be required throughout Liberia's COVID-19 response and in the years following.",

Liberia is no different, with slightly more than 19% of study participants screening positive for depression. Our study identified being \"very worried\" about household member's health as well as being \"very worried\" about household finances, to be highly correlated with a positive depression screen. These correlates make sense and are consistent with other studies which found that COVID's perceived or real impact on one's control over their daily life, predicted negative psychologic consequences [32, 33] . Over the last 30 years, Liberia has suffered multiple traumatic events. A study in 2008, five years after the end of Liberia's civil wars, found that 44% of Liberians suffered major depression and 40% had post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) [34] . Ten years later, roughly 20% of Liberia's Ebola survivors were reported to screen positive for depression and another 10% screened positive for general anxiety disorder [35] . Mental health problems were a problem in Liberia even before the COVID-19 pandemic. Providing mental health services has been challenging, as national mental health expenditures average about US$0.02 per person and there is currently < 1 psychiatrist and <1 mental health nurse per 100,000 population in Liberia [35] .",

            "text": "This study has several limitations. First, we tried to address safety concerns during the pandemic by conducting our survey by means of an email list-serv. This resulted in only 43% of potential participants completing the survey and thus limits the generalizability of study findings. We tried to select a population that was easily reachable through email and which could also provide household level information, as many respondents were expected to be back at their family homes at the time of the survey. However, by targeting students, our data are skewed towards younger respondents [IQR: 26,32 years]. Further, by targeting only households in which a medical or pharmacy student resides, we are likely limiting the generalizability of our results to households that may be more socio-economically advantaged compared to the general population. Next, we tried to explore and highlight household food security in our population based on two simple questions related to the quantity of existing food stocks as well as changes in one's food consumption. Many examples exist of more nuanced strategies and questioning for determining food security at individual, household, and country levels. Our questioning provides only a glimpse into this issue for our respondents and should be followed-up with more in-depth study. Finally, as this was a cross-sectional survey, no causal inference can be made as to the associations we highlight.",

Many have doubts as to the length of time they can maintain stay-at-home orders and reported limited ability to practice social distancing when out of the home. Despite this, Liberians show a willingness to comply when it is feasible, as highlighted by >80% face mask usage when out of the home. COVID-19 is putting stress on household finances and more than a third of respondents reported eating less preferred foods or skipping meals in the week prior to being surveyed. Positive depression screening was common and associated with intense worry about household member health and household finances. Until such time as Liberia has access to vaccinations for a majority of its citizens, national COVID-19 response measures need to provide social protections that address basic needs (shelter, clothing and food), and which specifically targets household level food security and ensuring maintenance of good nutrition. Preventative interventions for mental health problems must be incorporated into Liberia's response to the pandemic. ",
