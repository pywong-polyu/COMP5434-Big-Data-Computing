The dynamics is governed by probabilities, modeling for example the police action, the risk perception regarding crimes that leads to increase of ownership of legal guns, and so on. Our analytical and numerical results show that, in addition to the rise of criminality due to the presence of illegal guns, the increase of legal guns leads to a fast increase of violent crimes, suggesting that the access of firearms by civilians is not a good option regarding the control of crimes.",

The contemporary American desire to own a gun, but it is a desire with consequences. Indeed, USA has more civilian-owned guns than any other developed nation and as a direct result has a level of gun-related deaths unmatched by any other developed nation [2] . Surveys revealed that about four-in-ten US adults live in a gun-owing househould. Thus, roughly 40% of American households own a gun (about 30% of American adults), and half of those Americans who do not currently own a gun can see themselves doing so in the future [3] . Thus, taking the population size of US as about 334 million [4] , 40% means about 134 million guns. It was discussed that a record number of firearm background checks were completed in USA at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and during the protests following the murder of George Floyd [5] . Gun ownership is an expression of fear, but some analysis did suggest that people who own guns tend to exhibit lower levels of fear than nongun owners [6] .",

These crimes can be, for example, assaults, robberies and homicides, and the individual can be a gang member or a thief. These crimical activities are committed by using illegal guns, and it can be inhibited by the police action. In a recent work, the impact of illegal guns in the evolution of violent crimes was studied, and the author analyzed how legally-obtained guns can inhibit such crimes [11] . However, it was not considered the impact of such legally-obtained guns by citizens in the evolution of violent crimes, specifically in homicides. Recent studies analyzed the impact of homicides comitted by nonstragers, like husband, wife, mother, father, son, boyfriend, and others. For example, in USA, a parent was the perpetrator in the majority of homicides of children under age 5: 63% were killed by a parent (1980 -2008) , 28% by a friend/acquaintance and just 3% by a stranger [16] . In another work, it was observed that the average proportion of firearm homicides that were committed by strangers throughout the United States was only 21.9% [17] . Motivated by those data, we also consider in the model crimes (firearm homicides) committed by citizens that own legal firearms.",

Typically we are talking about assaults, robberies and homicides. The negative term with the parameter \u03bd represents the decrease of crimes due to the police's work. Finally, the parameter \u03bb is the novelty of the model, and it intends to take into account the rise of violent crimes due to legal firearms, as above discussed. We are considering that civilians only buy legal firearms (y). Thus, in this sense y quantifies the civilian gun ownership, since more legal guns mean more guns in civilians' hands. In such a case, the increase of civilian gun ownership (y) leads to the increase of crimes (x), in addition to the crimes committed by illegal firearms (z). This justifies the positive term +\u03bb y in Eq. (1). As a first approach to the problem of commitment of violent crimes by the use of legal guns by civilians, we considered the term as linear, but nonlinearities can also be considered in future versions of the model. In other words, the legal ownership of firearms by civilians leads to the commitment of crimes, for example a traffic fight can lead to a homicide if at least one of the civilians is a firearm owner, or the end of a marriage can lead the husband to kill his wife (or the wife to kill her husband) for not accepting the end of the relationship, if the husband/wife is a owner of a legal gun.",

In other words, if the percepection of violence is high, more guns are bought by civilians. Some governments have programs to control the guns' sales, like USA [18] . Thus, this gun control by the State is modeled by the parameter \u03b8, that of course only act on the legal firearms. Indeed, fear of crime is correlated with attitude toward gun control [19] . All those terms are considered linear for simplicity. On the other hand, the last term in Eq. (2) with the parameter \u03b3 models the situation in which a civilian with a legal gun's possession is robbed, and then that legal gun passes into the hands of an robber. In this way, this weapon is no longer a legal firearm because it changed its owner [20] . This term should be nonlinear since it models a kind of interaction among legal and illegal firearms.",

The terms can also be understood as follows. The positive term +\u03b4 z models in a simple way (linear function) how the current illegal firearms can be used to commitment of crimes such as assaults, robberies and homicides. These crimes lead the criminals to acquire money, that can be used to buy more illegal firearms.

The parameters are given in the caption of the figure. All parameters are rates, i.e., probabilities per unit time, and are given in unities year \u22121 . Specifically, as \u03bb is the new parameter of the model, we fixed all the other parameters and we exhibit the time evolution of x, y and z for two distinct values of \u03bb, namely \u03bb = 0.0 and \u03bb = 1.0, in order to compare the model with crimes committed by legal guns (\u03bb = 1.0) with the model of Ref. [11] , where such crimes were not considered (\u03bb = 0.0) 1 . First of all, we can see that the quantities evolve in time and after a transient the system reaches stationary states with stable values of x, y and z. These equilibrium values will be described analytically after an initial analysis of the time evolution. From Figure 1 we can see that a nonzero value of \u03bb has a great impact in the evolution of violent crimes x(t). First of all, we observe a fast increase of x(t) for initial times for \u03bb = 1.0. On the other hand, for \u03bb = 0.0, x(t) decreases for initial times and after it increases slowly and reaches the stationary state. Numerically, we found for \u03bb = 0.0 the stationary value x \u2248 0.1643, whereas for \u03bb = 1.0 we have the equilibrium value x \u2248 0.7431. In other words, the consideration of a relatively small value as \u03bb = 1.0 leads the equilibrium value of violent crimes per capita to increase about 4.5 times in comparison with the absence of violent crimes committed by legal firearms [11] . This considerable difference is the first impact of \u03bb in the model, in comparison with Ref. [11] . The other quantities, y and z, present a similar rate of increase for initial times, but for \u03bb = 1.0 the stationary values are greater than the case \u03bb = 0.0 [11] . Numerically, we found (y, z) = (0.9945, 0.6572) for \u03bb = 0.0 and (y, z) = (1.1249, 0.7224) for \u03bb = 1.0. As we observed in Figure 1 , the quantities x(t), y(t) and z(t) evolve in time, and after some time they stabilize. In such stationary states, the time derivatives of Eqs. (1) -(3) are zero. In the t \u2192 \u221e limit, Eq. (3) gives us two solutions, namely z = 0 (extinction of illegal firearms) or",

Thus, more illegal guns lead to more crimes, as observed in [11] . We can also see that as x * 2 grows with \u03bb, i.e., the number of violent crimes increases due to the presence of legal firearms in the civilians' hands, since more crimes can be committed by such legal guns (motivated by conflicting opinions or prejudice, among other, as discussed above). This is a realistic result, and it was not observed in the model of Ref. [11] since the author in [11] did not considered crimes committed by legal guns.

It means that if the government really control the sale of firearms, the legal guns can disappear of the population after a long time, and they cannot contribute to violent crimes. If the civilians do not own legal guns, the number of homicides can effectively decreases. Considering such strategy (a), the violent crimes can be reduced if the police action is increased in order to seize weapons. This is a difficult point, of course. For example, firearms registrations increased 120% in 2020 in Brazil, but seizures are down [23] . On the other hand, for the situation (b) we have:",

For rising \u03bb, crimes, legal and illegal guns increase, since the control of guns is weak. We also observe the same behavior as before, i.e., z * 2 \u221d \u03bb, y * 2 \u221d \u03bb and x * 2 \u221d \u03bb 2 . In other words, the number of legal firearms increases with \u03b2 and \u03bb, which leads to x * 2 = 0. Comparing with Ref. [11] , the author found x * 2 = 0. For our model, we see that the violent criminality cannot be eradicated in both situations (a) and (b). Since even in this limit of weak gun control the quantities x, y and z depend on \u03bb, it is clear that a substantial number of per capita crimes will be committed by civilians if they own legal guns. This can be an important result regarding firearms' control [9, 10] .",

As we considered that civilians only buy legal firearms, y * 2 represents the equilibrium point for the number of legal firearms per capita, i.e., it quantifies the civilian gun ownership. Thus, since \u03bb represents the rate of increase of violent crimes due to the presence of legal guns, our results show that the increase of civilian gun ownership leads to a fast increase of violent crimes, despite the slower grow of legal and illegal firearms. Thus, more guns do not imply in less crimes, but the opposite occurs. Indeed, regarding firearm incidents in American schools, as observed by the author in [25] , State gun ownership rates declined between 1980 and 2019 while school firearm incidents generally ranged between 20 and 40 incidents before skyrocketing to 102 incidents in 2018 and 110 incidents in 2019. In addition, another recent study examinated the association between gun ownership rates and homicide rates in the United States from 1973 to 2016. The results show a very strong positive correlation between gun ownership and homicide rates, which supports the hypothesis that higher rates of gun ownership increase the likelihood of homicide [26] . The authors in [26] found that, on average, a 1% increase in gun ownership is found to be associated with 2.6 additional homicides per million people. In agreement with [26] , the authors in [27] found that gun ownership was a significant predictor of firearm homicide rates: the results indicated that for each percentage point increase in gun ownership, the firearm homicide rate increased by 0.9%.",
