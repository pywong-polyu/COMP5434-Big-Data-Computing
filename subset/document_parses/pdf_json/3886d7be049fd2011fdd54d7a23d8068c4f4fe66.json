This special issue on 'Digital language practices: Media, awareness, pedagogy' is therefore particularly timely when most of the world has to suddenly switch on digitally. The research reported in these studies is a tour de force in which researchers start their queries from the digital spaces they are interested in. Each study in this collection highlights how everything is done differently digitallypeople read, write and communicate differently online, and organisations need to respond differently online. The studies in this collection show that the young people in the studies understand that perfectly and have adapted according. The collection of papers certainly speaks to the core national, social and economic issues we have faced in the last four months. This may sound intuitive, but our COVID-19 experiences teach us that digital adaptation is almost a best-kept secret. We have learned that we are not prepared for a global-scale epidemic, not medically, not mentally, and not economically. What we have also learned is that although technology is more important than ever, we have not taken people's digital practices as seriously as we should. Coronavirus (mis)information is spreading faster than the virus, and there is no stopping conspiracy theories and 'miracle cures' being populated online. Their reproduction numbers are higher than 1. With the first cases recorded in China, the rise of racism and xenophobia is not limited to the street as incidences of online attacks have also risen. Government surveillance, through contact tracking apps, for instance, begs for a new public understanding of algorithms. While governments around the world are trying to tell the stories of coronavirus for public consumption, whether it is about the use of 'war metaphors' (e.g. in the UK) or the language of science (e.g. in Germany), they are not necessarily giving out the stories in languages other than the dominant national language. Companies also are having a difficult time with storytellinghow to move from chanting 'we're all in this together' to selling new cars or bigger TVs now? Media and governments have trouble with learning at a distance as schools are temporarily switched to online delivery. Online learning became 'homeschooling' with various ministers saying students have 'lost' education rather than being educated differently.",

Many Australians with families and friends in Asia had heard about the Wuhan Pneumonia (before it was renamed Coronavirus) in late 2019 and early 2020, and learned about lockdown and school closure in China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Information was circulated on various social media platforms, especially on Chinese-language platforms. Many Australians also learned from their families and friends about how they have been dealing with school closure and education disruptions, the woes of online distance learning, working from home and self isolation.

With video conferencing sessions held for both personal and professional purposes, we are seeing our colleagues' and students' home deco (especially ceilings), pets and families, and more disturbingly, their choices of virtual backgrounds. We are sharing more than we would normally do in our regular daily interactions. We are obliged to share our bakes to show that we haven't gone insane. We are also now obliged to join office WhatsApp groups to keep these 'corridor chats' online. The new digital buzzwords include 'digital wellbeing' while working hours seep into evenings and weekends because we have nowhere else to go. And there are increasing reports of 'Zoom fatigue' as people are finding it more taxing to use video conferencing tools (Harvard Business Review, 29 April 2020).",

The Australian Education Minister, Dan Tehan, told everyone 'rather than bingeing on Netflix, binge on studying' (Brinsden, Apr 12, 2020) . There are 'good' digital activities, and there are 'bad' digital activities. Bingeing on Netflix is inherently bad, even though many foreign language teachers swear by various popular Netflix series as learning resources. There is even a Chrome extension, 'Language Learning with Netflix' (2020) to assist language learning. And how about the popularity of 'La Casa de Papel' reintroducing an Italian folk song, 'Bella Ciao' as the new symbol of resistance and a chart topper around the world? (Fernandez, 2020) . This response is not isolated in thinking everyone is doing nothing during the COVID19 shutdown. It appears that the Australian government is also not treating online learning as one way of content delivery, when the Prime Minister and Education Minister say that students are losing education by learning online at home and not in school (Sky News, 18 March, 2020; ABC News, 15 April 2020) . It is fair to argue that online delivery of school does not necessarily suit every child due to structural social and economic inequality of the families to access technology. However, it is unfair to say that students who are learning online are not getting educated at all. This shows a certain prejudice of our governments in conceptualising learning and digital practices. Even in the best of formal education contexts, digital practices are being viewed as the lesser half of the equation.",

While English (or the respective national languages in other countries) is predominately the only language used for education during the COVID19 disruption, as many schools (and including universities) immediately mobilised human resources for online transitioning rather than for language support, multilingualism seems to have disappeared. The focus on English (at least in the Australian context) in digital communication from governments and schools blindsided the multilingual repertoires of the students and their families. Though international students in many English-speaking countries are making a significant contribution to national income (AUD37.6 billions in 2018 -19 to the Australian economy), the consideration for their multilingual funds of knowledge is even more important.",

Students are bringing their out-of-class critical awareness of the world into their everyday interactions. International students are also demonstrating that they are very vulnerable during this time with limited access to part-time employment and travel restrictions. Many economists predict that study abroad as we know will not be the same (Bloom, 21 May 2020). We are certainly looking at a situation where international study is going to be virtual, or blended for a shorter stay for cost saving (Durden, 4 June 2020) . While Durden is speaking from the perspectives of American universities with the premises that courses are taught in English, he argues that a digital delivery of study abroad means thinking beyond currently modes of education. How we market and provide education internationally needs to incorporate basic understandings of how people communicate digitally, and translanguaging is a given. And this emphasis on digital delivery will also mean a new exploration of mode-switching which could mean a greater degree of clarity in meaning-making and understanding in online teaching and learning (Sindoni, this issue).",

There are also a number of countries rolling out similar contact tracking apps, for instance, the United Kingdom (to roll out in mid-May), France, Austria and Switzerland, and Russia. In the case of Australia, the tracking app COVIDSafe was released before the Privacy Amendment (Public Health Contact Information) Bill 2020 was passed. Everyone was pressed to download the app to the extent that the Prime Minister floated the idea that 'the first step back to the pub would be downloading the app' (Coughlan, 2 May, 2020) . There was only limited discussion of the possible privacy or surveillance issues. More than 5.1 million people in Australia have downloaded the app while the government and the app developer are still ironing out privacy issues. WESNET, a watchdog organisation, advises domestic abuse victims leaving phones with the downloaded app behind for any confidential support meetings. The number of uptake is lower than anticipated when there are an estimate of 16 million adult mobile phone users in Australia. This hesitation has been linked to mobile phone users' perceptions of the security used by the app, and the management of user data (Koslowski, 27 April 2020). Jones' (this issue) discussion of young university students' metaphors for understanding how algorithms work can be further narrowed as 'authority' and 'adversary' in the cases of contact tracking apps or digital measures. Though most people will only have a layman understanding of algorithms of digital tools and most are not actively aware of their pervasiveness on popular websites and tools (e.g. Google, Facebook\u2026), official and media pressure to download the COVIDSafe app made questions of digital privacy a matter of public debate.",

People reacted strongly to the presumed British Government's initial floating of a 'herd immunity' strategy. Americans were told that coronavirus infection was just like flu, and then the death rate in the US told a different story. In the early days, governments were not able to effectively use the mass media and digital media to give a coherent COVID-19 story (Bremmer, 12 Jun 2020; Dewan, Pettersson & Croker, 16 Apr 2020) . What is the story? Georgakopoulou's (this issue) analyses of marketing rhetoric and story-making on social media demonstrate that corporate stories have to conform to set template and algorithms. Governments, politicians, and scientists could not agree on one Coronavirus story because it is so new. Some governments use scientific language and some resort to war metaphors to create a response scenario (Musu, 8 Apr, 2020) . Is social isolation the only preventative measure? The global lockdown triggered the onset of mass unemployment and economic recession around the world. On traditional and digital media, companies are desperate to curate new storytelling of 'we are all in this together', and then 10 seconds later, just buy 'product X, Y and Z'. We have yet to brand COVID-19, and there is as yet not a coherent story of battling or recovering from this pandemic. There is no playbook, but there are algorithms. provide a new critical lens that could be applied to other applications and platforms, such as Instagram, Snapchat, TikTok, the use of 'groups' in messaging apps, online shopping and reviewing, the use of online tools in campaigns and protests, memes as political/subversive tools, talking robots, augmented and virtual realities, fake news, online dating, gambling and porn (and the increasing 'normalisation' of both practices), bullying and image-based abuses in social media\u2026etc. All these are linked to (young) people's everyday digital practices, and yet a pandemic shows us that the digital divide is not just about age or digital fluency, but it is the incorporation of digital literacy and practices in existing formal structure.",
