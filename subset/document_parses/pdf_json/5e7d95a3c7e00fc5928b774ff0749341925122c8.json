The conditional distribution of importation at different stages of infection is obtained from these 100 000 000 simulated travellers. Those who were infected but not yet recovered were extracted for further modelling. The amount of secondary transmission over their infected lifespan was then apportioned into transmission potential before arrival, during quarantine or isolation if any, and in the community. Quarantine and isolation measures were assumed to take place in a designated healthcare facility or centre where transmission risk is reduced to negligible levels, or at home with strict adherence where any family members present are also expected to follow the same measures.",

Additionally, for countries with relatively suppressed epidemics from lockdown or post-lockdown strategies in place, identifying cases on entry saves the need for more immense contact tracing efforts which are both time-consuming and expensive, and reduces the risk of continued virus re-introduction. Such implementation of present or future screening at entry points requires the exploration of different strategies with corresponding estimates of their relative success in capturing infections to be informative to policymakers. We therefore outline a method to quantify the risk of case exportation from 153 countries or territories per 100 000 travellers in 1000 simulations under six risk-mitigation strategies. In these strategies, we explore the use of isolation of test positives and quarantining of all travellers for 7 and 14 days, and estimate the number of cases captured, quarantining days averted and secondary cases which occur from missed importations allowed entry. the number of arrivals from 153 countries with recorded COVID-19 cases and deaths, we created a simple data-driven framework which calculates the number of infected people travelling based on the modelled time of infection and time difference to entry. As countries have different epidemic trajectories, they pose different risks of case exportation and are assessed separately. At arrival points, the effects of six strategies are explored in their efficacy in preventing the importation of cases.",

All cases, regardless of symptom profile, were assumed to have the same onset and incubation period distributions where asymptomatic individuals did not show symptoms. For condition (2), we used { } to estimate the number of symptomatic and asymptomatic incident infections each day, assuming the case and infection fatality ratio (CFR, IFR) estimates derived by Russell et al. 33 at 1.2% and 0.6% to be similar to those in each country of origin. Hence, we approximated the total number of incident infections in country in two categories, symptomatic ( ) and asymptomatic ( ), at time as indicator function. A symptomatic patient may visit a healthcare facility, determined by the simulated date of 's hospital admission ( ), also based on estimates from Linton et al. 34 with a corresponding lognormal distribution (Figure 1d). A random subset of the simulated symptomatic population was then removed each day based on the country's reported case count, leaving the remaining as mildly symptomatic and able to travel at . For condition (3), we compared the date of entry to the date of clearance defined as the simulated reported date or first day of symptoms with an additional 10-day infectious period. Based on the control strategies, a proportion of infected people are expected to clear infection whilst under isolation or quarantining, or will be permitted entry whilst infectious or infected and not infectious yet. No screening: entry is allowed for all incoming travellers from the source country, 2. Screening of all incoming travellers and 7-day isolation for test-positive travellers, with release into the community only with a negative test thereafter, 3. Screening with 14-day isolation of test-positives followed by a negative test, 4. No screening of travellers but a 7-day mandatory quarantine for all, 5. No screening but 14 days of quarantine,6. Screening of all passengers and entry prohibited for those testing positive. Strategy 1 serves as a baseline of no testing or quarantining where all individuals enter unconfirmed as to whether they are infected (Figure 2). Strategy 2 assumes that testing occurs upon entry where individuals testing positive are isolated for 7 days and those who test negative are allowed entry. Those who test positive are only allowed entry once they are confirmed to be negative with a subsequent test on day 7. Strategy 3 is the equivalent of Strategy 2 but isolation occurs over 14 days for individuals testing positive who then receive a second test on day 14. For Strategy 4, all individuals are quarantined for 7 days, and for 14 days in Strategy 5. For Strategy 6, all travellers are tested and individuals testing positive are denied entry. We summated the number of travellers at the point of entry or release from isolation or quarantine who were infectious or infected (and infectious later), depending on the strategy. We also calculated the number of quarantine days, defined as days spent at a quarantine facility or similar setting with minimal risk of infection to others) in all strategies, and measured the differences between Strategy 2 and 4, and Strategy 3 and 5, representing the time spent in a facility between isolation and quarantine methods for 7 and 14 days. The number of secondary cases was lastly calculated for each individual as the proportion of infectious days remaining out of the total 10 days of potentially active infection after the countries with the highest risk are presented which notable epidemics or surges in cases being reported (Figure 3; Full list of all countries is available in Appendix 1). Relative to allowing all travellers in unchecked (Strategy 1; Figure 3a), testing and isolating reduces case importation numbers by an average of 90.2% for 7 days (Strategy 2) and by 91.7% for 14 days of isolation for test positives (Strategy 3). Declining to test and using quarantine instead reduces case importation by 55.4% for 7 days (Strategy 4) and by 91.2% for 14 days of quarantine (Strategy 5). Prohibiting test positives from entry with no quarantining reduces transmission by 77.2% (Strategy 6). The testing and isolation of positive individuals for 7 days substantially reduces importation risk, and the requirement of a negative test prior to release from isolation increases the effectiveness compared to quarantine of the same length without testing. At 14-day quarantining, the effects of testing and/or quarantining are comparable as the substantial majority of travellers are no longer infectious. The isolation of test-positive travellers rather than quarantining all 100 000 travellers for 14 days however notably reduces total quarantine days for Brazil's travellers by 1 399 564 days per 100 000, 1 399 897 days for the UK and 1 399 763 days for the US (Figure 3b and Appendix 1), which brings economic savings whilst minimising importation risk. An average of 79.6% of infected travellers are infectious on arrival (Figure 4), with an estimated 30.5% having 1 to 3 days of infectious time remaining, 24.9% from 4 to 6 days, 24.2% from 7 to 10 days, and the remaining becoming infectious on arrival. If transmissibility is similar for travellers and the general public, then for an of 2 in July 2020, a no screening or quarantine policy would lead to 250 secondary cases per 100 000 travellers from the US, 433 from Brazil and 105 from the UK, but as few as 2 from Japan and 5 from Germany (Figure 3c and Appendix 1). For testing and 7-day isolation (Strategy 2) in the top 100 exporting countries, on average an 88.2 % (86.9%-89.4%) reduction in secondary cases in the destination country is expected; this would increase to 92.1% (91.5%-92.8%) for 14-day quarantine. For 7-day quarantine without testing, a smaller reduction of 30.0% (24.1%-40.5%) is expected. For 14-day quarantine without testing, an 84.3% (78.4%-88.8%) reduction is estimated, which is lower in efficacy than with testing, as an average of 6.4% of travellers become infectious 14 days or more after arrival that may be captured through testing at day 14 (Strategy 3). support a policy of testing arriving passengers from countries with ongoing transmission, followed by isolation until an individual is identified as having cleared the infection and is no longer infectious. This strategy would reduce risk to a level that would permit necessary business and leisure travel to continue with test-trace-and-isolate programs thus detecting additional infections that were missed at the border. Strategy 1, or no control, is not recommended as although travel restrictions may not act as a primary control measure, screening can prevent the entry of infectious and upcoming infectious travellers, which would otherwise require extensive contact tracing efforts and counteract ongoing control measures to maintain low levels of infection. Strategy 4 is also not recommended as it is relatively ineffective and implements the quarantining of all travellers, which is expected to heavily impact even resource rich countries. Strategy 6, although more effective, allows for the importation of individuals who are early in their infection and not yet detectable using PCR which is assumed to be three days before symptom onset in this analysis. Strategy 2 tackles this issue by isolating test positives until they present a negative result, only allowing the entry of potentially infected and infectious people through test failure which is relatively low provided test practices are robust. Strategy 3 is more effective than Strategy 2 as test positive individuals are kept in isolation until a minimum of 14 days where a greater proportion have cleared the infection and are no longer infectious. Where quarantining facility space is severely limited or long-term adherence is poor when individuals are quarantined at their home location, which may also expose their households members to infection, utilising a minimal 7-day isolation period for test positives remains a viable option. The usefulness of testing is shown for 7-day interventions with a 34.8% increase in caught infected travellers from Strategy 2 and 4 (90.2% versus 55.4%) where all traveller quarantining is substantially less effective. The extension of isolation days to a minimum of 14 days with and without testing has a difference of 0.5% (Strategy 3 and 5; 91.7% versus 91.2%), which is a relatively minor saving. In contrast, without testing, the extension of quarantining of all travellers from 7 days to 14 days without testing is critical, increasing the efficacy of the screening measure by 35.8% (Strategy 4 and 5; 55.4% versus 91.2%).",

            "text": ", the quarantining of all travellers for 14 days may be more feasible to implement over the conducting of rigorous and repeated testing of incoming travellers. The location for quarantine, whether it is home or institutional, will also likely impact the efficacy of the proposed screening strategies 39 and will depend on each country's ongoing control measures in place. For countries with good testing practices for travellers in place, the testing of travellers remains an effective strategy in reducing importation risk, and substantially negates the risk of community spread occurring from potential non-compliance of quarantining measures among travellers. Testing also substantially reduces the number of quarantining days among travellers by over 1 399 000 days for 14-day quarantining. Countries should thus assess whether testing or 14-day quarantining is viable and cost-effective, considering their own policies and access to testing or quarantining facilities. Where testing practices cannot maintain high case finding rates as the sensitivity of the testing measures is reduced by a factor describing improper test handling, further country specific analyses will be required to ascertain whether the quarantining of all travellers may be unavoidable (Appendix 2; Strategy 2 and 3 show a diminished reduction of 73.6% and 75.6% in an alternate scenario where the global PCR sensitivity profile is reduced by 75%).Several challenges exist however in our estimations moving forward, requiring the ascertaining of PCR test sensitivity as a function of the whole infection period and asymptomatic status, considerations of country-specific test practices and examining of the actual proportions of travellers who are likely to travel between countries which remains a significant current unknown. Political concerns should also be accounted for where the limited entry of travellers in Strategy 6 who are returning to their home country after long periods of stay abroad may not be feasible and dependent on country-specific entry policies.",

If testing is not feasible, quarantining for a minimum of 14 days is recommended with strict adherence measures in place.IntroductionThe COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a global cessation of almost all cross-border travel where the public health implications and economic impact are unprecedented relative to other emerging infectious disease epidemics[1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9][10] . The lockdown in Wuhan, China, where SARSdemonstrating the need for strict compliance of no entry at borders. This however is unsustainable in the medium to long term as the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak continues to spread globally, making travel bans a delay strategy and not preventative, which has been previously observed by the World Health Organisation who did not recommend their long term use for global pandemics due to the severe economic impacts caused16,17 . Pressure is thus increasing on countries to lift travel restrictions and implement alternative control measures at their borders, which includes screening18,19 .Many countries are additionally emerging from lockdowns, which have successfully suppressed outbreaks or reduced the epidemic size in multiple countries 20 , and to avoid further lockdowns from recurring or new outbreaks, the risk of case importation or exportation should be minimised. Case exportation risk has been previously explored which identified Thailand, Japan, South Korea and Singapore as high risk countries for case importation from mainland China due to high traffic volumes in the early phase of the epidemic 21 but the global epidemic has and continues to rapidly evolve.
