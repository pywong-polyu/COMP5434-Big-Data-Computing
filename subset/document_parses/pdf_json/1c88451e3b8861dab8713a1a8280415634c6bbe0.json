Sexual distress can be present within this group of patients. The aim of our study is to carry out the cross-cultural adaptation/translation and validation of the Female Sexual Distress Scale-Revised (FSDS-R) for Brazilian Portuguese women with VL. Methods Women age \u2265 18 years, with VL (n=82), and without VL (n=53) were included. Continuous variables were described in the form of mean/standard deviation or median/range, and Student's t test was used. The Chi-squared test was used for dichotomous variables. Cronbach's alpha coefficient was used for internal consistency and Spearman's correlation was used to assess construct validity (FSDS-R, Female Sexual Function Index [FSFI], and Incontinence Questionnaire Vaginal Symptoms [ICIQ-VS]). A significance level of 5% was established using a two-tailed test. Results Women with VL presented more anal/vaginal sexual intercourse than women without VL (p=0.030). All three instruments (FSDS-R, FSFI, and ICIQ-VS) presented discriminant validity between women with and without VL (p<0.001). A high internal consistency (Cronbach\u00b4s alpha =0.887) was found in women with VL and without VL (0.917). Regarding construct validity (n=82), there was a strong positive correlation between FSDS-R score and ICIQ-VS scales, except for a weaker correlation between the ICIQ-VS vaginal symptoms subscale (r: +0.2788; p=0.013). A moderate negative correlation was found between FSDS-R and all FSFI domains (p<0.001), except for pain (p<0.062). Conclusions The Brazilian version of the FSDS-R showed adequate internal consistency and discriminant validity, and a correlation was found with other instruments such as FSFI and ICIQ-VS.",

Women with VL may be representative of an early stage of development of pelvic organ prolapse [3] ; however, a consensus on this matter has not yet been reached. According to another study, VL differs from pelvic organ prolapse, the former being related to symptoms concentrated in the vagina and the latter involving the descent of one or more pelvic organs [4] . The decreased vaginal sensation during intercourse may be related to anatomical damage to the perineal body, vaginal canal or introitus, underlying nerve and connective tissue damage during pregnancy and childbirth, or potentially a combination of these factors [5] .",

Cronbach's coefficient alpha, item-test correlation, item-rest correlation were used to measure the internal consistency (homogeneity of items belonging to the same scale). Spearman's correlation was calculated by comparing the FSDS-R and FSFI and ICIQ-VS scores for construct validity.

In the initial translation, only the first, the tenth, and the twelfth questions presented moderate, mild, and mild divergences respectively. In question one, for the term \"distressed,\" we opted for the translation of \"angustiada -distressed\" instead of \"desconfort\u00e1veluncomfortable\", as the term \"desconfort\u00e1vel -uncomfortable\" is broader and could be interpreted differently within the Brazilian context. In questions ten and twelve, the translated terms were synonymous and would not cause problems of interpretation or understanding. Likewise, the backtranslation process showed mild differences related only to synonymous terms. Table 1 shows the distribution of both groups according to sociodemographic and clinical characteristics. The mean age was similar in the two groups. Education longer than 8 years was frequent in both groups, with women without VL more likely to present a higher level of education (98.12% vs 78.04%). Women with VL were more likely to be multiparous and to have a higher number of pregnancies when compared with the non-VL group. On the other hand, women in the non-VL group were more likely to undergo cesarean and to perform vaginal intercourse than women with VL. Table 2 describes the discriminant validity according to the FSDS-R, FSFI, and ICIQ-VS scores and their domains between the groups. Sexual distress measured by the FSDS-R presented significantly higher scores in women with VL than in the non-VL group (26.88\u00b114.39 vs 11.09\u00b111.92). Although the floor effect was seen in FSDS-R (17.04%), no ceiling effect was observed (4.44%) in this questionnaire. Regarding the FSFI questionnaire, women without VL presented higher scores in all FSFI domains, except for desire and pain. Higher scores were seen in women with VL in all ICIQ-VS subscales (p<0.001).",

Overall, we found slight divergences throughout the cross-cultural adaptation process, and we may suggest that the final Brazilian version of the FSDS-R can be considered similar to the original English version. Considering the questionnaire scores, sexual distress, sexual dysfunction, and vaginal symptoms were higher in women with VL. Our findings showed an acceptable and satisfactory internal consistency for all questionnaires (FSDS-R, FSFI, and ICIQ-VS). Regarding construct validity, a correlation was found between FSDS-R score and ICIQ-VS vaginal symptom subscales. Similarly, a moderate negative correlation was found between FSDS-R and all FSFI domains, except for the pain domain. In our sample, women with VL had a higher frequency of vaginal delivery and multiparity than participants without VL. These findings corroborate those of other previously published studies that also found evidence for a connection between vaginal delivery/parity and symptoms of VL [5, 15, 16] .",

However, most of the questionnaires assessing sexual function were developed in the English language [18] . Thus, because Brazil is a country with continental extension and a known prevalence of sexual dysfunction of 67.7% [19] , we believe that the translation of the FSDS-R will contribute immensely to the assessment of sexual distress in women, not only with symptoms of VL but also with other sexual dysfunctions. In our findings, sexual distress, as well as sexual dysfunction and vaginal symptoms, was higher in women complaining of VL. Sexual distress has also been assessed in women with VL in previous studies, but these studies had lower mean scores than our findings. The study by Millheiser et al. had a mean total FSDS-R score of 13.6 \u00b1 8.7 in a group of 24 women in the pre-treatment period [7] . Likewise, Krychman et al., in a randomized clinical trial, observed a total score of 19.4 \u00b1 12.0 in a group of 122 patients in the active group [9] . The mean total score found in our population was 26.88 \u00b1 14.39. We reinforce the need to assess sexual distress in patients complaining of vaginal laxity.",

The study by Berenguer et al. translated the FSDS-R into the Portuguese language of Portugal and showed an internal consistency similar to our findings [20] . The construct validity and the correlations between FSDS-R and FSFI were also similar in the two studies, only differing in the pain domain (FSFI) in our study (r -0.2117; p=062) [20] . The Turkish version was published in 2016 with a population of 248 women with complaints of sexual interest/arousal disorder and other female sexual dysfunctions and participants without complaints of sexual dysfunction [21] . The authors performed a similar data analysis, differing only in the test-retest, factor structure, and cut-off point analysis, which we did not perform. In addition, a correlation analysis of the FSDS-R and the FSFI questionnaires was performed, as in the present study; however, the results differed slightly between studies [21] . The Persian version of the FSDS-R was constructed by a group of Iranian researchers in 2014 and applied to 652 healthy participants [22] . In this study, only the internal consistency could be compared with our study, proving to be similar to our findings [22] . Finally, the Polish version of the FSDS-R was applied to a population of 75 women with hypoactive sexual desire disorder, 31 women with other dysfunctions, and 104 participants without sexual dysfunction complaints. Internal consistency was similar to ours with a coefficient \u03b1 > 0.70 [23] .",
