The study was conducted with 340 individuals between March 1, 2021, and April 2, 2021. The data were collected using the Personal Information Form, the Paranormal Belief Scale and the Social Efficacy and Social Outcome Expectations Scale. Statistically significant positive correlations were found among traditional religious beliefs, classical paranormal beliefs, spiritualism, witchcraft, social efficacy expectations and social outcome expectations. It was concluded that traditional religious beliefs may be effective in improving the social acceptance of individuals, and believing in a common religious/cultural supreme entity unites individuals.",

The individual conducts their interaction with their social environment through verbal/non-verbal behaviors, and these behaviors may indirectly shape the social efficacy and social outcome expectations of the individual. Social outcome expectations are beliefs about the outcomes of a behavior that is exhibited (Bandura, 2006) . Regarding social outcome expectations, people shape their behaviors by choosing actions that are likely to have positive results or by avoiding actions that are likely to be reprimanded (Akin & Akkaya, 2015) . In this context, it may be stated that, sometimes, individuals try to achieve their social outcome expectations by the spontaneous acceptance or rejection of paranormal beliefs that fit the socio-cultural characteristics of the society they live in. In the literature, there is no study investigating the relationship between the paranormal beliefs of individuals and their social efficacy and social outcome expectations. For this reason, we may state that this study, which examined the relationship of the paranormal beliefs of individuals with their social efficacy and social outcome expectations, is the first study that is going to contribute to the literature on this issue. In this study, answers to the following questions were sought within the framework of this general purpose.",

The validity and reliability of the scale in Turkish were tested by Arslan (2010) by making it suitable for Turkish society and Muslim culture with additions specific to the culture, based on Tobacyk and Milford's (1983) internationally widespread PBS. PBS consists of two basic dimensions. In the first dimension (items 1, 8, 13, 15, 16, 18, 22, 27, 28, 29) , there are statements regarding traditional religious belief. Other items are included in the classical paranormal beliefs dimension, which includes the sub-dimensions of Psi Belief (2, 9, 23), Witchcraft (3, 10, 17, 24) , Superstition (4, 11), Spiritualism (5, 12), Extraordinary life forms (6, 20) and Precognition (7, 14, 21, 26) . PBS is a five-point Likert-type scale in which each item is scored as 5 = Strongly Agree, 4 = Agree, 3 = Undecided, 2 = Disagree, 1 = Strongly Disagree. There is no inversely scored item in the scale. High scores indicate a high level of belief in the paranormal. The minimum and maximum possible scores in the traditional religious beliefs dimension of the scale are 10 and 50. The respondent can get a minimum score of 27 and a maximum score of 135 in the classical paranormal beliefs dimension. The overall Cronbach's alpha reliability coefficient of PBS was reported as \u03b1 = 0.85, while the reliability coefficients of the dimensions were found as \u03b1 = 0.89 for traditional religious belief and \u03b1 = 0.78 for classical paranormal beliefs. The Cronbach's alpha reliability coefficients of the sub-dimensions of the classical paranormal belief dimension were reported as \u03b1 = 0.56 for psi belief, \u03b1 = 0.81 for witchcraft, \u03b1 = 0.60 for superstition, \u03b1 = 0.69 for spiritualism, \u03b1 = 0.60 for extraordinary life forms and \u03b1 = 0.68 for precognition. The analysis showed that PBS is a reliable scale (Arslan, 2010) . The Cronbach's alpha value of the scale was found as 0.86 in this study.",

SESOES is a measurement tool consisting of two dimensions as social efficacy expectations and social outcome expectations, which constitute 18 items in total. The social efficacy expectations dimension of the scale consists of 12 items (1-12), and the social outcome expectations dimension consists of 6 items (13-18). It is a 5-point Likert-type scale where each item is scored as 5 = Strongly Agree, 4 = Agree, 3 = Undecided, 2 = Disagree, 1 = Strongly Disagree. High scores indicate that individuals have high levels of beliefs about being able to perform a behavior and the result of the behavior exhibited. The minimum and maximum scores that can be obtained from the scale are 18 and 90. There are no inversely scored items in the scale. The Cronbach's alpha internal consistency coefficients of the scale were found to be \u03b1 = 0.93 for the social efficacy expectations dimension, \u03b1 = 0.88 for the social outcome expectations dimension and \u03b1 = 0.94 for the overall scale (Ak\u0131n & Akkaya, 2015) . The Cronbach's alpha internal consistency coefficients of the scale in this study were found to be \u03b1 = 0.95 for the social efficacy expectations dimension, \u03b1 = 0.88 for the social outcome expectations dimension and \u03b1 = 0.94 for the overall scale.",

            "text": "Although paranormal beliefs are regarded by some people of different religions, cultures and ethnic origins as nonsense, illogical or against science, they might be accepted by many people in different parts of the world. It was stated that people who have paranormal beliefs have higher life satisfaction levels and recover faster in case of illness (Haider, 2019) , and it may be considered that paranormal beliefs affect people positively, just like the placebo effect. It may even be argued that having common paranormal beliefs has a unifying effect on individuals, and in studies on this topic, individuals were observed to socialize, and their feelings of belonging to a group were reinforced. Born with an innate tendency to believe, human beings have believed in something to have peace and security in every period of history (Topuz, 2012) . It is known that religious beliefs play an active role in human behavior (Y\u00fcce & Kavak, 2018) . Moreover, openly religious people, who see religion as an instrument for the maintenance of social order and life, are socially dominant-utilitarian people (Okumus, 2006) . Hong (2019) found that the paranormal belief levels of openly religious individuals are high. Furthermore, the rational living conditions offered by today's conditions are not enough for a person, who exists as a combination of many different aspects. While these living conditions satisfy certain aspects of human beings, they may be insufficient to address other aspects (Zezelj & Lazarevic, 2019) . As people make an effort to fill this gap, the search for meaning in life begins, and in 11 Social outcome expectations -this search, there may be a tendency toward traditional religious belief, which are accepted by society and more common. It is known that attitudes about religion and the search for a meaning in life become clear in the young adulthood period (Certel, 2011) . The high level of traditional religious belief in the individuals participating in this may be explained by the possibility that they were in their young adulthood period; they had the desire to reach a destination in their search for meaning in life and to fill the gaps in different aspects of the human being by adding meaning to life. Similar to our research, in the study conducted by Andrade (2021) with people belonging to the Maria Lionza religion, it was found that individuals had high levels of paranormal belief and believed that they could develop their paranormal powers by holding hands with people who have healing powers through mysterious forces. As social beings, humans are always in an interaction with those around them and strive to establish a bond and a sense of belonging. This sense of belonging is transmitted from generation to generation through traditions such as belief, language, culture and art in Turkish society (Ulagli, 2020) . In Turkish society, many traditional and cultural practices such as weddings, guest-hosting and holiday celebrations enable individuals to socialize (Arik, 2019; Cetin, 2008; Senocak, 2014) . Turkish society is a society in which social relationships are intense, and individuals are in active communication with each other (Avcioglu, 2020) . In this context, the above-average social efficacy and social outcome expectation scores of the individuals participating in this study may have been due to the specified characteristics of the specified society. In other studies that have been conducted in Turkish society, it has been seen that individuals' social efficacy and social outcome expectation levels were above average, and these parameters were also related to social support (Bakioglu, 2019; Zorlu-Yam & Tuzel-Iseri, 2016) .",

According to the results of our study, the positive and significant relationship found between the participants' scores in the witchcraft sub-dimension and the social efficacy expectations dimension may explain why people turn to witchcraft to solve their problems by communicating with supernatural beings, get what they want, and thus, have a special place in the society they live in.",

Having common beliefs such as paranormal beliefs is perhaps one of the tightest bonds that hold the members of a society together (Ozdemir, 2017) . It was asserted that religious beliefs are not only an individual but also a social phenomenon and play important roles in the stability and balance of social structures (Simsek, 2020) . As a member of a society, an individual born in any society not only undertakes the secular or cultural mindsets of the society but also learns the religious thoughts and values of that society. Therefore, religious beliefs are among effective parameters in the socializing processes of individuals (Akkir, 2019) . The determination of a positive relationship between the traditional religious belief of the participants of this study and their social efficacy and social outcome expectations supported this idea. The possibility that individuals with common traditional religious belief are considered socially adequate in their society and the rise of social outcome expectations with paranormal beliefs may be because belief can be accepted as the strongest factor among factors that bind society.",

It is also known that paranormal beliefs have a wide range of uses, including religion, telepathy, witchcraft, supernatural and extraterrestrial life forms, and superstition experiences. In this study, in which the relationship between the paranormal belief levels of individuals and their levels of social competence and social outcome expectations was examined, it was determined that the traditional religious belief levels of the participants were high, and their classical paranormal belief levels were moderate. As the participants' traditional religious belief and classical paranormal beliefs increased, so did their beliefs in factors such as spiritualism and witchcraft, as well as expectations for social efficacy and social outcomes. It was determined that the individuals' traditional religious belief was related to their social efficacy expectation and social outcome expectation levels. It was observed that the individuals with classical paranormal beliefs such as spiritism and magic beliefs also had traditional religious belief. In line with the results, it may be considered that traditional religious belief may be effective in improving the social acceptance of individuals, and believing in a common religious/cultural superior entity unites individuals. Considering the results this study, it is recommended to conduct studies that include parameters such as communication patterns, personality traits, interpersonal relationships, perceptions of social support and socializing behaviors, which are thought to affect individuals' paranormal belief levels and social skills.",
